L:  Okay.  I'm in California.
R:  What kind of hobbies do you do?
L:  Uh, I love going to the movies.  I love to read.  I, um, belong to a book club.  I retired about three years ago and so I just love walking on the beach.
R:  Mm.
L:  And being in nature, and just taking part in anything that my community has which has lots of stuff always going on.
R:  Well, I kind of like to use my computer.  
L:  Okay, I just --
R:  I like to use it to do surveys.  To make money or do couponing to s- save at a grocery store or -- and ref- refunding and different things like that.
L:  That's -- well, how do you do -- I just got a computer two weeks ago.  How do --
R:  Oh, I love my computer.
L:  So how do you do it to do surveys and --
R:  They have --
L:  -- make money?  
R:  -- [SIGH] like survey sites.  Different ones.  I -- if you go on and you just put in +search you -- search for surveys.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they'll come up and you go and you register, and then they will come a- and send you emails when they have a survey ready for you.
L:  Oh.  And is that okay to do, uh, when you get these emails that you don't know what they are?  Everybody is +cautioning me not to --
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Well, mo- --
L:  -- open up an email I don't know what it is.
R:  Uh, this is a -- [MN] you know, for where it's from on your topic and you'll get so you'll know --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- the names of which ones you want.  [MN]
L:  Oh.  So do you get money for doing that?
R:  Yeah -- yes.  I just got a check today for twenty five dollars for one I'd done.  
L:  Oh, I love that.  
R:  Yeah.  And I do, um, [MN] try out products.
L:  Ye- yeah.  Oh, they send you the product.
R:  Uh-huh.  And then you try it out and then they -- you -- they send you a survey and [MN] your -- in your email and you answer the questions and then you get money for it.  
L:  Wow, I can't wait when we hang up.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm gonna --
R:  It's fun.
L:  -- plug in surveys.
R:  Yeah.  I do, um, there's one called Pinecone Research and it's for five dollars each time, and it doesn't really take very long to do it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they, a lot of times, send you the product and you try it and they give you another five for doing -- for trying it out.  
L:  [MN]  Besides you get to try out a new product which --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is fun.  
R:  Oh, yes.  I've [MN] just can't hardly wait to get it in the mail.  Right now I'm trying out a lotion on my skin.
L:  Yes.
R:  Last week I tried out toilet paper.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, that's great.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you have any of your friends do that too?
R:  No.  Most of them -- I'm the only nut in the family.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's so fun- -- well, I'm gonna be the nut in my family.
R:  [LAUGH]  Hey, it helps.  It really does and you -- you know, it's interesting.  
L:  [MN]  Very interesting.
R:  And I've got gift certificates to Amazon and, um, different things for filling out surveys.  And I go on there and there's different sites where you can get reward points and you can get, um, like, gift certificates to Walmart and places like that, so I do those.  
L:  Well, what's --
R:  That's --
L:  Is that survey site also?
R:  No, this is -- the one I go to is, um, memolink.  
L:  Memo?
R:  Uh-huh.  M.E.M.O.L.I.N.K.
L:  Wow.
R:  And you do points and you get different things.  You click on different things everyday and you get so many points and at the end of the [MN] --
L:  Well, who told -- who told you how to do all that?
R:  [MN]  Nobody.  I'm [several inaudible words].  I just went on and [MN] started looking --
L:  You just sat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you just find it?
R:  Re- reward sites and they, uh, have different ones where you can make money while you're on there.  You might as well enjoy it.
L:  I'm writing this down.  I'm gonna be a --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- rich woman.
R:  [LAUGH]  I hope.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it's fun.  
L:  [MN]
R:  It really is.  It -- it gives you time on -- [MN] on the computers.  There's different places on there that tells you, you know, where the good buys are and -- and everything at the stores and everything, which is a big help.
L:  Well, I've been looking at ebay.
R:  Oh, they have some nice stuff on ebay.  That's a good site.  I mean --
L:  It's very --
R:  -- it --
L:  -- interesting because, like I s- I saw some shoes that I know in the store were over a hundred dollars.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there it is on the auction site for, like, nine or ten.
R:  Well, you better -- you better jump at that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I like, um, I collect Boyds[?] bears.  
L:  Oh.  What -- what kind?
R:  The -- any kind that's the plush.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- so I get the, uh, just the Boyds as they're not as expensive as some of the other ones.
L:  Wow.
R:  And you go on ebay and there's probably three thousand on there.
L:  And do you buy them on ebay?
R:  I ha- I have.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If I get a -- if I think I get a good enough buy.  But you can spend hours --
L:  Do you ever --
R:  -- on ebay.
L:  -- sell them on ebay?
R:  No, I've never sold anything.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've thought about selling stuff on there but I've never had enough nerve.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Because people definitely do make money at it.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  And there's one called half dot com and it is, um, books and magazines.
L:  What is it called?  Half?
R:  Half.  Half dot com.  And it's [MN] -- it is owned by ebay.  
L:  Okay.  Half dot com.
R:  And it -- you can sell your magazines, your books, your CDs, your DVDs, all that stuff on there.
L:  Um ...
R:  Or you can buy 'em too but, you know.
L:  What else are your favorite sites?
R:  Well, I've -- I have -- I have a -- the one I go to the most, I go to my coupons.  And it has a, when you go to my coupons it's [inaudible] to have shopping boards.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you click down and it'll tell you where the best deals are on the internet and where the best stor- -- deals are in the stores.  And stuff you get signed up for free.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I get -- I have -- I never buy magazines.  I get all my magazines free off the internet.  I mean, I get oodles of magazines.  
L:  You mean it --
R:  Good Housekeeping.  Red Book.  
L:  You're kidding?
R:  No, I never pay for 'em.  I mean there's always something on there some place offering them for free so why pay [LAUGH] for it.
L:  Wow.  You should be a teacher.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Or you should be on Oprah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] that would be good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No --
R:  But it is.  It's really --
L:  -- that would be such fun.  Do you have a family?
R:  I have two children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they're, uh, you know, old enough.  They're married.  I got -- I just now got a new grandchild.
L:  Oh, a boy --
R:  My first one.
L:  -- or a girl?
R:  Boy.  
L:  [MN]  
R:  And he's five months old.
L:  [MN]
R:  And so cute.
L:  That -- I -- I have eight grandchildren.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And the first one is graduating college in two weeks.
R:  Oh, my.  That's -- that sounds --
L:  And, uh, you know, your family is just so important and so wonderful.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's the best thing that you did.
R:  Oh, yes.  Definitely  
L:  You know.  To contribute this -- these good people into [LAUGH] the world.  
R:  It --
L:  It's just really fun.  Do you like living where you do?
R:  Yes.  It's a little small town and I like it real well.
L:  I like small towns.
R:  Mhm.  It's not very --
L:  So --
R:  -- big.  Less than five thousand people.  So it's pretty small.
L:  Wow, do you know everybody?
R:  Well, no.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Some of them I don't really want to know.  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Yeah.  And are you near a big town?
R:  Uh, about thirty miles.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  From a big town, from a big --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- shopping mall.  So that's where I usually go to [inaudible] or some- -- I live close to Saint Castle which has a big shopping mall.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And --
L:  And do your children live near you?
R:  About an hour away.
L:  That's good.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because sometimes they get married and they move far away.  
R:  Yeah.  So it's pretty neat.
L:  That's not good.  
R:  No.  I -- I get a chance to go up about every weekend to see my grandson, so ...
L:  Oh, that's so nice.  
R:  He's -- he's --
L:  So how did you happen to sign up for this?
R:  It was on my -- one of my sites on the [LAUGH] internet.
L:  [MN]  Oh, because my daughter just, uh, called me a day or so ago and said, "Oh mom, I signed you up for this".
R:  It's pretty neat.
L:  And -- and I said, "Well, what is it?"  She said, "Just talk like you always do".  
R:  You know, hey, how -- how -- I mean it's a dollar a minute.
L:  I [MN] oh.  
R:  I mean, what can you think?
L:  Great.  Do they send you a check?
R:  Ten dollars -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for each one you do.  I think you can do three.
L:  How long [MN] --
R:  Possibly five.  
L:  How long do you have to wait before they pay you?  
R:  Oh, a lot of the people that -- on the site ha- ha- have already been paid.  They said the check comes pretty fast.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So ...
L:  Well, that'll be nice.
R:  Yeah.  It's a nice little [MN] thing for just doing --
L:  It is and wouldn't it be --
R:  -- what I usually do [LAUGH] anyway.
L:  [MN]  Can you do it over and over again?
R:  I think some said they did it three times, some said five.  So sometimes they call you.  They called me twice and this -- today I thought I'm just gonna call in myself.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because they sent me a PIN number and I can call in now.  I don't have to wait during the time period that they give me.
L:  Oh, so this is -- was your third time?
R:  This is my third time.
L:  Wow.  What -- don't you think this would be interesting, uh, if we were both in the same place and just passed each other on the street?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, the first person I talked to -- I -- I go on the site Refunding Makes Cents and you have to belong to this site.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the woman that I talked to the first time, she was on there too.  Which is really --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- strange.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, to be picked two people --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- from the same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I thought -- [inaudible] I said, "You wouldn't happen to be on Refunding Makes Cents would you?"  She said, "Yes, I would".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh, this is really odd.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that is funny.  Now, um, so are you on many sites where you have to pay to get in?
R:  Well, the Refunding Makes Cents, I used to always get the newsletter through the mail.
L:  Uh-huh.  And do you pay [MN] --
R:  And so I don't get the newsletter any more.  I just pay a dollar a month --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to her and then I go on and get all the deals on there instead of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- buying the news- -- because I never really have as much time to sit down and just read it. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I thought, well, heck, if I just go on there I can still get the same amount and
