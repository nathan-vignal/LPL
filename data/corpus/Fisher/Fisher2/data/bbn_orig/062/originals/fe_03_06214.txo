R:  Do you have any hobbies?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you have hobbies?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  What --
L:  Reading and, uh, refunding.
R:  Oh, you know what?  I didn't even think about refunding.  That's one of mine too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Reading.  I was gonna say reading, uh, crafts at home, but refunding is like, at the top of that list with the coupon clipping.
L:  Yeah.  I've gotta do my coupons and I gotta do my refunds.
R:  And how do you go about doing your refunds?
L:  Um, well, you -- I usually look for a coupon and then look for its own -- if it's on sale.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I buy the product and make sure whatever I need's just on one tape because they --
R:  Oh good.
L:  -- you know, with these tapes, and then I send it in.  I'm, uh, also I'm -- I have a -- a few sites that I visit where they tell you about the forums.
R:  Oh really?
L:  And I take --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Refunding Makes Cents.
R:  Is that one of the sites, Refunding Makes Cents?
L:  Yes.  But she --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- also has a, um, a magazine she puts out once a month.
R:  Oh really?

R:  Well I'm gonna have to go on that site. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I think it's Refund Cents.
R:  Okay.
L:  R.E.F.U.N.D.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  C.E.N.T.S. dot com.
R:  Okay.  Well, I'll try that because [LAUGH] I didn't even expect --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to get some information outta here but that's good.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I enjoy it, do you?
R:  I -- yes --
L:  Well, I guess you do.
R:  Well, I do.  And I always am putting out things to show my husband like, "+Look, I got this free" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I'm still using a Tropicana towel that I got from Tropicana orange juice about ten years ago.
R:  Oh [LAUGH]!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, do you read or do you go to the movies or ...?
R:  Well, I read.  I like -- I have two kids, so it's really hard anymore.  I used to read --
L:  How old are they?
R:  They're, uh, sixteen and fourteen.
L:  Oh, that is a difficult age.
R:  Right at the age, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And keeping me busy so -- but I actually still try to sneak in books and -- because I a- -- I become very involved and I don't hear what's going on or -- I just really love to read.  I u- -- and I also read the books my kids have to read in school.
L:  Well now, this is good.  This is.  And there was --
R:  What do you like to read?
L:  There was another question they were gonna ask about, do you think books should be censored, um, I think it was on this, or it may have been something else, for -- for children, or not children but do you think that the high schools should tell the children what they can read and what they can't read?
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't think that's on this questionnaire but ...
R:  You were on another one?
L:  What?
R:  You were on another questionnaire?
L:  No.
R:  Have you done another one?
L:  No, this was just something I read about one of the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- surveys.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I was thinking, I don't know what I would answer on that.
R:  Yeah, well, I guess it depends on the book. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Or the child, how much --
R:  Or the --
L:  -- they would, uh, you know, if they were ready for it or not, which is a good thing, if you read 'em ahead, you know.
R:  Yeah.  What -- w- well what do you like to read?
L:  Oh, mysteries.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Who's your favorite author?
L:  Um, it's according to what book I'm reading.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right now I'm reading Ed McBain, The Eighty Seventh Precinct.
R:  Oh, I've seen that.
L:  I like him.
R:  I don't think I've read any of his.
L:  Uh, he's got The Eighty Seventh Precinct and they're different detectives and he writes sometimes short stories and sometimes novels, and they keep the same characters.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I guess I haven't then.
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  I like true crime I hate to say.
L:  Uh, let's see.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  There's a book out of some of the, um, stories that have been published in that magazine, it's a book ... True Crime.
R:  Do you know what it's called?
L:  True Crime.
R:  Oh, True Crime! Oh!
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] I --
L:  There's a magazine out, True Crime.
R:  Oh there is?
L:  Yes.
R:  Have you looked at that?
L:  I haven't read that in, I don't know when, but this one lady that writes for them has written a book about different true actual crimes that happened.
R:  Well, is her name Anne Rule?  'Cause that's who I read quite a bit every time she puts out a book.
L:  I -- Anne --
R:  Rule.
L:  Anne who?  Lowell?
R:  Rule.
L:  Rule.  I don't -- I don't remember.  But the Anne -- course there's so many authors with the name Anne, but still that sorta rung a bell.
R:  R- -- oh, now ...
L:  Anne --
R:  Well, I wish -- Anne Rule.
L:  Yeah.  Okay, I'll have to look her up [several inaudible words] because I like different types of mysteries.
R:  And who e- -- what else have you been reading?  What did you read before that?
L:  Oh, let me see, it's in here in the chair.
R:  Oh! [LAUGH]
L:  Haven't got it back to the library yet.  I don't buy many books, we get -- we've got a pretty good library here.  Um --
R:  What part of the country --
L:  Oh, CSI do you ever watch that on --
R:  Oh, I love CSI!
L:  Okay.  They've got --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- paperback books of the, uh, different cases that they've had.
R:  Oh they do?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, I'll be buying those.
L:  And, uh, we've got three of 'em.  I think three's been published and that's the only three we saw.  That's the one I read.
R:  Okay.
L:  All right [inaudible] --
R:  I'll probably read that next 'cause I just ...
L:  Which one do you like best, Miami or Las Vegas?
R:  Las Vegas.
L:  Las Vegas, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, let's see.  Th- those -- that would've been the last one I read out.  Before this one.
R:  What part of the country are you from?
L:  South Carolina.
R:  Oh.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Los Angeles. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's fairly early out there for you, isn't it?
R:  That's right.
L:  So ...  Now, let's see, what else was the different things besides the hobbies? [NOISE]
R:  The hobbies and ... I don't know, I think that was it.  Hobbies like reading or -- do you have any other hobbies?
L:  Well, let me see, I got this writ- -- I've got this printed out.
R:  Oh.
L:  Hobbies.  What are your favorite hobbies?  How much time do you spend?
R:  Oh, how much time, okay.
L:  And do you feel that every person needs at least one hobby?
R:  Oh, that's right.
L:  Yes, they do.
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  Um --
R:  I agree.
L:  Do you know, I could spend eight hours a day on refunding.
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I wish I could.  I -- I can't seem to find that many.
L:  Well, that's what I spend my time, going store to store looking. Not --
R:  Oh.
L:  Not all the time, no, not all the time.
R:  Well, see, and so that makes it enjoyable.  See, things like that, that's why people need hobbies.
L:  And I do have a lot of traders.  Like, I find the good forum, I trade with somebody in, um, different parts of the country that are looking for that forum and they've got forums they send me.
R:  Oh wow, you really are involved! [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  And coupons more than forums now because you just can't find the rebate forums.
R:  Wow.  I ca- -- that --
L:  They don't put 'em out like they used to.  And --
R:  Well I am amazed, you are really involved.
L:  Well --
R:  Here I thought I was involved.  I guess I'm involved in -- than most of my friends.
L:  Well, I'm retired.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I have, uh, more time than I did when I was working.  And, um, it's just -- and my husband goes with me when we go out.
R:  Oh, he does?
L:  Yes, he's retired.
R:  So he likes the -- see, so he joins along in your hobby.
L:  Oh, the other day he went in to buy, uh, some bread at the store.  This one cashier, I always try to use her when I check out.  She looked up, [inaudible] to him and she said, "Does your wife know you're in here without a coupon?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, when they even know -- see then, that even makes it even more personal.
L:  Right.
R:  Your hobby.
L:  We live in a very small town.  And everybody knows everybody else.  So --
R:  Well, and -- and then, like, they go to that question, does everybody need a hobby?  Some hobbies calm you down.  Like, if you knit or something like that, so it makes -- a hobby seems to be what people enjoy so it actually takes your mind off of stress.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  So I think it's good.
L:  It's nice to get into something that you're -- that you're m- -- like you said, it calms you down, your mind is all on that, it's not on --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- "What have I got to do tomorrow?  Who's gonna --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- come over?  What have I got to clean?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's absolutely right.
L:  And, let's see.  I used to crochet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I never did learn to knit.  And I used to sew.
R:  I used to sew.
L:  But I'm trying to sell my machine in the garage sale, nobody'll buy it.
R:  Well, I -- I would -- I did like to sew but it's almost -- it's cheaper to buy the outfit.  I would go and buy a zipper, it was so expensive to even buy a zipper and I thought --
L:  Buttons.  Have you priced --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- priced buttons?
R:  No.  Are they expensive too?
