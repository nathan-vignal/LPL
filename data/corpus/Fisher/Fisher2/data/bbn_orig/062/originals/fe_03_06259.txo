R:  Hi.  This is Stephanie in Kansas City.  Who is -- who am I speaking with?
L:  Hi.  This is Donna.  I'm in New York, Delaware.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  Hi there.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  So, we are discussing hobbies, huh?
R:  Yes.  What is your hobby and --
L:  Uh ...
R:  -- how much time do we spend on it?
L:  [LAUGH] And should everyone have one?
R:  Right.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh [LAUGH], okay, we got that part.  Good.  Um [LIPSMACK], what are my hobbies?  Do I have any hobbies?  I can't really say I have time for hobbies.
R:  Yeah?
L:  So, I don't really have any.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'd like to call shopping a hobby, but it's really not a hobby.
R:  I think shopping is a hobby to me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's one of my hobbies as well.  That's for sure.
L:  Well, I like to -- if -- if I had time for a hobby I like to put puzzles together.  I like puzzles.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like I see, um, pictures, uh -- but, I mean, I see nice puzzles that I would really like to take time to sit down and do, but ...  Oh, I do have a hobby.  I like doing hair.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just don't have a lotta time to do it anymore, but I used to do it.
R:  Well, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a nice hobby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wish I had time to have somebody to do my hair.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] it was a hobby, you love to do it, and I was doing everybody's hair and then after a while it was like I was the only one with the messed up hair and everybody else had wonderful hair.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Well, I ...
L:  [several inaudible words].  But, no, go ahead.
R:  Oh, no.  That's great because like I said I wish I had time, or I wish I had a friend that loved to do hair as a hobby or anything.  Mainly, um, I'm on the computer a lot, but a lotta times it's really -- my hobby is like coupons and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and refunds and stuff like that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and there's a website, the one that I found out about the re- Fisher project about --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it's all about -- like everybody goes on there and they post to say okay, well, I found this great deal, you know, if --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, K. Mart has this sale and then if you use this coupon --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- you know, you can get it for fifty cents, or --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or like you can earn money by --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- calling up the Fisher project and you earn --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ten dollars per call, you know, stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  Ah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  I haven't, um -- I'm on the computer all day but -- you know, I work --
R:  At work?
L:  -- I work eight 'til twelve thirty.  So, when I get home --
R:  That's the last thing you wanna do?
L:  -- uh, I really don't wanna look at a computer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, but I also -- I do a lotta -- I think I'm hooked.  I feel like help, I'm working and I can't stop.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't have time for a hobby because I'm working so much [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I kinda like because I like being detailed and I like checking those things together.  So, I'm running here and doing this, I'm running there and getting this done, I went over this, do this assignment, come back, then I have to put it into the computer, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- put the web report in.  So, I don't know if that's considered a hobby, but ...
R:  What is it?
L:  It's -- it's mystery shopping.
R:  Yes.  I do that as well.
L:  Merchandising, uh --
R:  I ...
L:  -- all that stuff, demoing and I think I wear so many hats now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Merchandising and stuff like that?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yep.  My husband and I just recently started doing mystery shopping as a hobby.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I guess you could consider it a hobby --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- it's sort of -- we know that we're going out to eat anyway.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  We like to because it's just the two of us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We like to go out to eat anyway.  So, I figured why don't we get paid for it?
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  So, we just started doing a lotta the mystery shopping and he's a fulltime student so he has more time to do some of the daytime things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like -- like the stores and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and, you know, stuff like that.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we do that quite often, you know?  Sometimes it seems like it's too much and then there are times where --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we go between, you know, where you can only do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a certain assignment --
L:  Right.
R:  -- over so many days.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, then it seems like there's a dry spell and we're just like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sitting there going, "I wanna go someplace good to eat", you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Feast or a famine.  So, I guess, yeah, if -- like for me I guess I do that for income.  So, it's really not a hobby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I like the extra income.  I like the -- the variety of what I do.  But I think maybe a hobby has to be something that relaxes me.  And, you know, it asks whether we think everybody should have one.
R:  Yeah.  Mystery shopping's --
L:  Well ...
R:  -- not very relaxing at all.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, you know, because you're I spy, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, I think that -- like I said, if I -- if I had a hobby I think it would be puzzles, you know?
R:  Puzzles would be fun.
L:  Puzzles or -- or drawing or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even just reading, you know?
R:  See, that's me.  It's been a long time since I've been able to sit down and read a book.
L:  And just read a book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just think I can't do this.  I don't have the time to do this.  I have to do this.  I have to do this.  I have to do this.
R:  Right.
L:  And so that's why I don't have a hobby, but I -- I think I need to get back to, uh, basics and I need to cut some things out and -- and after all a hobby is more like a quiet time for yourself.
R:  Right.
L:  It's something that you really enjoy doing.
R:  Yeah.  And I think maybe a lot of it now is most people feel like how much -- how much is their time worth, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I'm not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- making any money sitting here reading this book.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  But I could money doing, you know, something else.
L:  Right.
R:  So, instead, you know, more -- more time is focused now on money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- rather than, um, free time.
L:  Relaxation.
R:  Right.  Ex- ...
L:  Yeah.  You know, it's like free time no, no, no.  Free time is money.  [LAUGH]  So, you know, sitting down and just doing this for money we don't look at that.  It's something that's supposed to relax us and something that we enjoy doing like something -- like needlepoint or something, you know?
R:  Right.  And I think it may have all started -- even like now people with children they're always having their kids doing something, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like they have the soccer and they have --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- the gymnastics and they have this and they have that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They never just come home and --
L:  Sit.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sit.  Right.  And talk or relax --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or take a bath or, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just, you know, quiet down time kinda thing.  So ...
L:  I think that -- that leads me to believe that yes, maybe everyone should have a hobby because it's a time of relaxation and everybody needs that in this go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go society, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like we're energizer bunnies, you know, we -- we can't stop, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I ought -- like I said, I've been telling myself oh, help, I'm working and I can't stop, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I can't, you know, it's like saying no [several inaudible words], you have to choice to say no or not.
R:  Right.  But then --
L:  You don't have to apply for ...
R:  -- you're like no, I wanna ...
L:  Now, how do I that?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, yeah, I wanna do it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't wanna do that and -- and before you know it you're -- all your time is consumed.
R:  Is ...
L:  So --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I wanna do something relaxing and I don't know what it is.  I don't know what I would do as a hobby, you know?
R:  I don't either --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause I'm like if -- if I get -- if I'm at home for several hours at a time and I -- well, when [NOISE] -- I -- I have to do something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- you know, I'm -- I'm bored, I'm not doing anything, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] You got it.
R:  I ...
L:  So, maybe we should make our hobby something that we can make money off it and -- and we love doing.
R:  Exactly.
L:  If it's something you love doing and you can make off of it then great.  Like some people make those little dolls and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  I have a cousin that makes, um, those little bad dolls where they stand in the corner --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and they -- they -- you know, they got their head and she makes those up from scratch and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- makes little things out of, uh, uh -- makes little pot holders and things out of --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- dish clothes and all -- all kinds of stuff.  So --
R:  Yeah.  You ...
L:  -- she's real crafty like that.
R:  Yeah.  If you go in ...
L:  So, she decided to make money from it.
R:  Yeah.  You go into Michael's or wherever and you see --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all this stuff and you're just like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, my gosh!  What is it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  They have all this just [NOISE] stuff.
L:  Yeah.  But ...
R:  What am I gonna do with this?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What am I -- what -- I'm just -- I'm so not crafty.  I guess I've just never taken the time to learn -- learn how and I look at them and I'm like, what am I going to do with this big sticker?  What am I going to do with all these stamps and, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Like, I went into, um -- A.C. More was going out of business or they were moving --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I went in to purchase I don't know, I think some little roses or something and I came out with this big giant bag of little bottles and salts and -- and flowers and --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- that stuff is still in my basement and it's been there a couple of years now.
R:  Ex- ...
L:  I was like what was I going to do with this shit?  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  'Cause one year I decided oh, I know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make Christmas presents this year.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm gonna make, you know, flavored vinegars and oils.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm gonna get the, you know -- get the pretty bottles and I'm gonna get --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the vinegars and I'm gonna get all the recipes and then, you know, it's Christmas Eve and I'm running out --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- going to buy stuff because I didn't do my crafty project, you know, and then I have all this stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- exact- -- that's exactly it, you know?  I'm gonna make something and then it's like oh, okay, yeah.
L:  So, maybe -- maybe turning your -- your hobby into something that makes money might not make it relaxing anymore.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, you might ...
R:  Because then you feel like you have to -- you know, like there's a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a -- a -- you have to make something of it, you know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Oh, I haven't made any money on it.  Oh, my hobby is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know -- I have a worthless hobby 'cause I didn't make any money on it, you know, or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  So, yeah, I guess -- I mean, once you have one -- and maybe society as a whole needs to ...
R:  Focus more on -- on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hobbies and relaxing time and not worry so much about money or -- or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what you spend [NOISE], you know -- what you spend your time on, you know?  Stop measuring the time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  In dollars.
R:  -- in dollars.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That's -- that's what I think we just do and we just cannot, you know -- it's like multi task, multi task, multi task.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, nobody has time for a hobby until you get broken down -- too old and broken down and you go oh, well, I can't do nothing now.  So, now I'll get a hobby.
