L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi.
L:  I've not done one of these.  My name is Carol.
R:  I haven't done one either. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  My name is Misty.
L:  Hi, Misty. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi.  
L:  This is so bizarre. [LAUGH] Okay, what are we -- we're supposed to talk about hobbies?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, what's your hobby, Misty?
R:  Well, I like to do crafts.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what kind of crafts do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you do?
R:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] I do a lot of florals. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I had a booth in a store, but I gave that up. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, is this with live flowers or with material flowers and stuff?
R:  Material.
L:  Oh, how neat.  Um, yeah, I've seen some of that.  I -- I -- I live in Los Angeles, I don't know where you are --
R:  Indiana. 
L:  Indiana. 
R:  Shelbyville. 
L:  Oh, my goodness. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know where that is.  But I'm sure it's nice and peaceful compared to here. [LAUGH] 
R:  Not really. 
L:  No?
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh, well, it seems like a nice small --
R:  Probably better than L.A. 
L:  Pardon?
R:  Probably better than L.A.
L:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I -- I don't have any friends who do craft flowers.  I know a lot of people who are into that scrapbooking thing, which I haven't started doing yet, [LIPSMACK] because I have a feeling if I start it, I would never stop. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I guess I can -- only say is that my hobby would be more about -- I -- I -- I dig around in a very tiny, little garden that I have, and it sort of keeps me sane, you know, planting flowers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and tomatoes, and I guess I would call that a hobby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't actually make things or do something by hand any more.  I wish -- wish I had time to do that.  I just never seem to find the time to do it.  When -- when you do your flowers thing, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is -- is that something you do for -- you said that you had a -- a pla- -- a place in a store?
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  And now, do you just do it on your own?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And --
R:  I plant flowers too. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  And what?
R:  I said, "I plant flowers".  I just dug up, like, three flower beds.
L:  Oh, wow.  Good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for you.  That's right, it's in the real world it's spring, out here we've already hit summer. 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh God, it's hot.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's one of those days --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where you just sit there and go, "Oh, it's --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- too hot".  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, we -- I already actually have some -- I have some, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- little cherry tomatoes, they're starting to turn red, believe it or not. 
R:  I love tomatoes.
L:  One of the small advantages of living in Los Angeles.  Except the summers are really disgustingly hot.  But you can sort of grow, you know, herbs, and, um, [LIPSMACK] tomatoes and stuff.  Not year round, but it -- it's a lot lon- longer growing season than -- than the Midwest -- or the East Coast where I'm from originally. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Where there's winter and stuff, so ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know, but I'm sure -- I'm sure you get much better, you know, fruits and stuff in the summer than we do.  'Cause here it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too darn hot. 
R:  [LAUGH] Our humidity is pretty bad.
L:  Well, I -- I do- -- you know, I think I was once in Indiana driving across country about twenty five years ago, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't remember it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but my mom lives outside New York City in New Jersey and last year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was really bad there, I must say.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But you take the good with the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bad, I suppose.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, um, what happened with your flower --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- store?  I guess we're supposed to be talking about hobbies and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how you make them and things like that.  It's so easy to talk to a stranger and say, "So, where are you from and why are you doing this too?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it just -- it just wasn't working out at the store.  They changed --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- owners and [NOISE] my little baby girl [NOISE] --
L:  I can -- I can hear her.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I told her to [NOISE] leave me alone, but she's not. [NOISE] 
L:  Do you -- do you have time?
R:  This -- I guess this is a bad time. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Well, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're going to come and interrupt us.  I haven't timed it yet.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they say that it's gonna time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- us so I guess we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- should --
R:  We talk about hobbies.
L:  Talk a few -- yeah, talk for a few more minutes.
R:  [NOISE] Well, they asked if everyone should have a hobby [NOISE]. 
L:  Right.
R:  I think everyone should have a hobby. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, absolutely.  Oh great, that was another question.  Oh, absolutely, because if you don't do something besides your normal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- job, or raising your family or something, you can get a little cuckoo, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I -- I think art hobbies are great.  Um, I used to paint when I was a kid and stuff like that and I've, um, thinking of taking it up again.  But, um --
R:  Oh, I can't paint.
L:  I -- I couldn't either.  But it was fun and then for a while I got into, um, a few years ago, um, doing, like, bead work, you know, how, like, Native Americans do all those pretty bead --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- things?
R:  Yes.
L:  And I went to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- an Indian event near where I live, 'cause we have a lot of -- not a lot, but you can find Indian Powwows and gathering around Los Angeles, believe it or not, a lot, and I saw some beaded stuff and then took some craft lessons to make sort of beaded pouches, and it's great, except it gets so nerve wracking 'cause you've got these, you know, little teeny beads and these really skinny needles and after a while you start to getting cross eyed [LAUGH] trying to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] do it.  And it takes a long time.  But they're sort of a relaxation thing that goes with it, but I, you know, I'm not good enough or fast enough to -- to sell anything like that, so ... I'd had to put it down for a few years because I just hadn't been around and I've been travelling and stuff like that.  But, um, with your flower thing, do you -- do you have time with the kids to make it or is that something you can do while they're in the room?
R:  I -- I don't have much time lately.
L:  Right.
R:  I have a baby.
L:  How old is she?
R:  She's fifteen months old. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Now she gets into everything that I do.
L:  Oh, good grief.  Well, maybe -- maybe when she gets a little bigger you'll be able to get back in on it, or, you know, sell it on eBay or, you know, something like that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if the stores don't work out.  And how -- I guess I'm supposed to ask you what else -- how you got into it, was that one of the questions, or how long you've been doing it. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] About -- I've only been doing that f- -- like, for about a year.
L:  Is it --
R:  I didn't know I could do it.
L:  Really, how did you find out about it?
R:  I just tried it once and it worked out. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's great.  So, you mean you saw somebody doing it or saw a flowers like that and said, like, "Hey, I wanna do this myself"? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really neat. [inaudible]
R:  And then my newest hobby is I'm on the internet all the time.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What kind of stuff do you do?  Do you, like, read news or go to TV show websites or --
R:  Well, I shop.
L:  You shop, uh-oh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's dangerous.
R:  Well, I usually don't spend any money, I just, you know --
L:  Browse.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do -- do you -- I mean, I'm a horrible eBay addict.  I sometimes, instead of doing things I should be doing, like cleaning up my place and stuff like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'll just sit there and look up obscure things on eBay and just see what they go for.  What people are selling. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know why I do that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, I like old things and vintage things and, like, hard to find things, but yeah, it's dangerous.  But I -- I -- I congratulate you for being able --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to shop online and not spend money.
R:  [NOISE] Thank you.
L:  That's a very good thing to do, I guess. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I know, how did we ever live without the internet --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I wonder.  But it's pretty cool.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I end up, yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's sort of a hobby of mine too, but I end up reading --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- newspapers from all over the world and, you know, stuff like --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause there's a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- news that you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can get.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, English news --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like the British news and some of the European papers print --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in -- in English --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and there's a really interesting perspective, you know [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from -- from what's going on here, so I, you know, I do a lot of that kind of reading and stuff, you know.  I don't [MN] -- I can't read that much 'cause my eyes get cross eyed, but I, you know, I spend time at least looking, especially if things are going on in the world, and getting other opinions, and then I look at travel sites thinking if I won the lott- lottery all I would do is travel [LAUGH] right now. [LAUGH]
R:  That would be nice. 
L:  Oh, yeah, and get out of debt and all that and spend more time doing hobbies.  Unfortunately life gets in the way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, this is your first call too, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, well, I guess, I don't know, do you wanna --
R:  My children aren't cooperating very well. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I'm sorry about that.  I'm just wondering, I haven't really clocked it, next time I should clock it, but I was just [SIGH] -- I think it's been, like, about seven minutes.
R:  My phone shows nine minutes.
L:  Nine minutes.  Okay, then we'll gather one more minute.  Tell me about the flowers [LAUGH] you make. [LAUGH] Or the last one that you did make.  Maybe it'll cut us off then.
R:  Well, I make a lot of wreaths.
L:  Oh --
R:  Like --
L:  -- like holidays wreaths and stuff?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, how pretty.
R:  My favorite is, ah, like, the, ah, Thanksgiving, those kind of colors.
L:  Oh, for -- for the autumn and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really nice.  Do you -- do you make them for -- for family or for friends or just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for yourself?
R:  For family.
L:  Oh, how nice.  And --
R:  Friends.
L:  -- what kind of -- do you use materials like -- like branches and flowers and stuff or do you -- do you use all manmade materials, or is it a mixture?
R:  Well, I usually buy the wreaths.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And then a -- a grape vine wreath and then I just buy flowers --
L:  And -- and put then in and stuff.
R:  Put them in there and get little scarecrows in there and it's really pretty.
L:  Oh, it sounds really nice.  That's a -- that's a nice thing to do. [LIPSMACK] Well, hopefully someday you'll have a whole big wreath store or something and -- and be able to make some money at it.
R:  [MN]
L:  Or at least if you do it to enjoy yourself and then -- and it makes, you know, people happy who you give 'em to, that's great.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] I just don't ever seem to find the time any more.
L:  How -- how many kids do you have?
R:  Three. 
L:  Oh, good grief.  I -- I don't have any.  I have an old cat. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I -- and my sister has, ah, an eleven month -- a twelve month old.  She just turned a year, and she works fulltime and does gardening for people up in Maine and -- and she brings the baby with her, 'cause she's still doing partial breast feeding.  And I, you know, she's losing her mind, so I don't know how somebody does it with three kids, but bless you. [LAUGH]  Well --
R:  Well, they're tw- [MN] -- my six year olds are twins. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, good grief --
R:  So --
L:  -- so you probably --
R:  -- I need a hobby. [LAUGH] 
L:  You need a hobby.  I bet -- I bet you you're happy when they're all asleep. 
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, well maybe when they get a little older, they can -- they can get into doing it too.  You know, if they have any interests --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- in crafts or anything like that, 'cause kids love doing that kind of thing.
R:  I also read.  
L:  What --
R:  I'm looking at my bookshelf right now.
L:  Oh, good for you.  What kind --
R:  I have almost every Steven King book that there is.
