R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Melanie.
L:  Hi, my name is Renee.
R:  Hi there.  Can you hear me okay?
L:  Yes, I can hear you fine.
R:  Okay.  Good.  I just wanted to be sure.  
L:  Oh, okay.  So what is your favorite hobby?
R:  Scrapbooking.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm into couponing.  I like to save money.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I never even thought of that as a hobby but that's -- that can be fun.  We just subscribed to the newspaper a month ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so I've started getting my coupons and I'm like, "This is great!"  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, really.  Because, like, over here we have stores that double coupons up to fifty cents.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And stuff like that.  So sometimes you can get free stuff, like free food and all kinds of stuff [MN] using coupons so ...  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  'Specially when you have --
R:  And --
L:  -- kids, it's very helpful.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  That's what I'm learning.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's definitely been worth the time of -- you know, it takes ten minutes to sit down and clip coupons.
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  It's more time to, uh, find the stores and figure out who's got the better deal and things like that.  But ...
L:  Yeah, exactly.  But, I mean, usually [MN] it's -- it's not too much trouble so, I mean --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when you -- like you say, you know, considering all the money you save is worth it, so ...
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So how long have you been scrapbooking?
R:  Um, for about four years now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I started just after my first child was born so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  That looks fun but if I -- it's quite addictive, huh?  And you have to get all the stamps and --
R:  It is.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [inaudible] and everything.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause I've always seen --
R:  And [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- it on TV and it's like a dream.  I was like, "Oh, look at all the goodies."
R:  Oh, you can start small.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You can start small.  All you need is, you know, your pictures and acid free paper and a -- and a permanent marker and you're good to go.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]  You can just kind of build up from there but ...
L:  So do you think, like, would you consider it, like, a pretty cheap hobby or does it get pretty expensive or ...?
R:  It depends on what you do.  And you can [MN] build up.  There's a lot of things that you can buy that you will always use.  I -- like paper punches I buy.  And that's something that once you buy it you use it forever.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Um, so you don't have to buy it all at once.  It can get expensive to start if you want a lot of things.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it -- like I said, if you start small.  Go on ebay, you can find a lot of things there.  
L:  Oh, okay.  I know --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- [MN] I just went to Dollar Tree this weekend and they have some scrapbooking stuff for a dollar.
R:  Yeah, I've noticed --
L:  Like the little, um --
R:  -- that they do that.
L:  -- cards or journal sheets or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, like, it looked so fun but it's, like, you know, I'm not like creative.  I have to actually see something first to get ideas.
R:  And that's how -- 
L:  You know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's how I am.  Most of my pages I've copied from somebody else so ...
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's not such a bad thing.
L:  Uh-huh.  But I mean, how many -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  How much time do you spend doing your scrapbooking?
R:  I try and set aside one day a week where I can spend, like, three to four hours.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And try and get things done.  And it's one of those things that you're never caught up with.  You're never finished.  So ...
L:  Yeah, exactly.  So how many are you working on right now.
R:  I have one for each of my kids.  I've got three -- three kids. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Then one for our family, and every once in a while I do a page for my mom, because I'm in California and she's in Idaho.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so that way I can send her pages and she sees how the kids grow, and things like that.
L:  Oh.  [MN]  That's pretty cool.  That's a neat way to see them, you know.  That's pretty --
R:  Yeah, and it's -- it's neat 'cause they like to look at the pages and see what they were doing and how they've grown.  
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Instead of just looking at a picture by themselves and trying to figure out, you know, oh, I wonder how old --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were and all this, you know.  That's pretty fun.
R:  Right.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I really enjoy it.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
R:  And how long -- how long do you spend with -- with couponing?
L:  Um, I really don't spend that much time at all.  Just whenever I have free time, you know.  If I'm just watching TV or something I just cut the coupons or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I usually go on the internet and trade coupons and I subscribe to a refunding magazine that tells me about all the deals.  So you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- really don't have to do much work.  They lay it all out for you already.
R:  Yeah.  I notice --
L:  Nice and easy.
R:  -- just recently noticed the number of coupons you can find online that you just print.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  But the --
R:  And there's --
L:  -- stores have been pretty reluctant lately to accept those.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Because most of them think that they're like counterfeit or that you've copied them a million times and stuff like that.
R:  Oh.
L:  So it's pretty hard, but ...  But, like, usually, like, even the companies, if you just email them and tell them you like their product they'll send you a bunch of coupons and stuff like that.
R:  Huh.
L:  So usually I go through my cabinets and I was like, "Ew, which companies do I like?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  'Cause you write to all of them and most of them are pretty generous.  You get a few that, you know, they don't want to give you anything but most of them will give you coupons and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or other freebies.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I've been on, like, the cyber websites and I know that they put me on their mailing list so that every couple weeks I get a free coupon.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, not, a coupon --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for free stuff but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a couple of dollars off which is always helpful.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, [MN] I mean two or three dollars, you know, can buy you other food, you know.
R:  Right.  
L:  I mean some people --
R:  You know,
L:  -- you know, to me like two dollars is a lot of money, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  [several inaudible words].  I mean --
R:  It's --
L:  -- even if you go to the dollar store, I mean that's two items right there, you know.
R:  That's [LAUGH] right. 
L:  [LAUGH]  Every dollar adds up, you know.
R:  That's right.  I love the dollar store.
L:  Oh, I know.  That store is so addictive.  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like I try really not to go there, you know, 'cause it's like, you know, you wind up finding things that you think you need but you really don't need, you know.
R:  Every once in a while we'll all -- a bunch of friends will get together.  We -- we would go to the dollar store and see who could buy the neatest thing for their dollar.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, to --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  Because it's -- you take the time to look around in there.
L:  Yeah, really.  Um, 'cause we just got a new one that opened by us and it was a lot bigger than the other one.  You know, and it's like, "Wow, look at all that stuff".  You know, and they have like name brand, like [inaudible] and stuff like this.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it makes you wonder why all the other stores selling it for, like, three dollars a box and then the dollar store can sell it for a dollar, you know.
R:  Yeah, and it's the same --
L:  It's like, you know --
R:  -- thing.
L:  -- you know, how much a profit they're making, you know.  Oh, geez, it's so expensive.
R:  So then I guess the other thing we're supposed to talk about is whether or not we think people should have hobbies.  Was that right?
L:  Uh, something --
R:  Or [several inaudible words] hobbies --
L:  I just think they said if --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- you had a hobby and how many, I think.  [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I think -- I mean, I think everybody definitely has a hobby.  I mean, I think you'd go crazy if you didn't do something that was fun --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for yourself, you know.  
R:  It keeps you active.
L:  Yeah, I mean, even if it's just walking.  I mean,  [LAUGH] --
R:  True.
L:  It's better than nothing.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Um ...  But that's about my only hobby I think is, um, couponing or, no, that's [inaudible].  My other, um, hobby is, like, um, pen paling.  Writing letters --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to pen pals and making these things they call friendship books.  You make a little friendship book out of whatever paper you want.  And then mail it to somebody and then everybody mails it and everybody signs their name and address in it.  Until -- and --
R:  Oh, how neat.
L:  -- when it gets full then they return it back home to you.  So it's really fun.
R:  That is really neat.
L:  Yeah, 'cause then you have people sometimes from all around the world signing your little book.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's really fun.  [NOISE]
R:  Very cool.
L:  Mhm.  So is scrapbooking your only hobby.
R:  Pretty much.  I -- and even, like I said, there's little time that I spend with that.  Just staying busy with kids and such.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm not really sure what else I would say I do.  I don't garden much.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  It's definitely not --
L:  -- didn't -- I didn't started a garden yet.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's not something that [MN] necessarily as a hobby.  I don't like playing in the dirt and the bugs and [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, really.  [LAUGH]  
R:  But [several inaudible words].
L:  I'm fine when I'm outside until I see the wasp and bees and then I'm like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- running like a little kid, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  To me it's more of a chore than a, "Gee, let's go outside and be gardening" so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Getting all dirty and getting stung and all that.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, I mean, I like -- usually we plant flowers.  We get like the little, um, packs of seeds, like ten for a dollar.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And my girls li- like to watch them bloom so ...  We plant a few of those and they're doing pretty good right now.  The little seedlings are coming out.
R:  Good.
L:  So they're doing pretty good.  And, I mean, for ten cents each, I mean, it -- if they die --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's like no big deal.  [LAUGH]  So ...  [MN]
R:  Well, that's fun.  
L:  Yeah.  So you were saying you have three kids?
R:  I do.
L:  Do you have girls, boys or both?
R:  I have two girls and a boy in the middle.
L:  Oh, okay.  I have three girls.  [LAUGH]  So they're -- that's my other hobby that keeps me busy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Three little ones.
R:  Yeah, kids are -- are busy.
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, and I have a cat that's trying to chew the phone cord.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, gosh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Come on.  
L:  He's like, "Why don't you feed me?  Get off this phone". 
R:  Shoo, kitty.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  She wants to be played with.
L:  [MN]  So how long have you been doing these surveys on the phone?
R:  Um, only a week.  
L:  Oh, okay.  This is only my second one.  
R:  Yeah, this is my third so ...
L:  [MN]  I didn't think it was really for real.  I didn't think I'd ever get any calls or anything.  I was like it's too good to be true, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  I was just kind of curious if it was true or not and if I'd get a call.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, 'cause I mean [MN] you're not losing anything, you know.  I figure so I'll --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- put my information on.  I mean, if they want to call me and give me money [MN] then I'll be more than happy to take it.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Right --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's what I figured.  I'll -- I'll take the ten dollars a phone call.
L:  Yeah, really.  I mean -- I -- I think that's what ten dollars?  So that's like a dollar a minute.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean, who else pays you that much money, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right.  And I've -- you know, I'm an at home mom so I figure I'll do whatever I can to raise a little extra cash.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Every penny counts, you know.  But, I mean --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- just to talk and then you get to talk about your favorite things.  I mean, what could be better than that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, most of the time most people don't want to hear about your hobbies anyway so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now you can say, "Well, I'm getting paid for it".  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, I was curious.  I'm like, "Do I answer this call?" 'cause there've been two that have come through and I was like, "You know, I'm just too busy to take 'em right now" and when I heard that it was hobbies, I thought, "Oh, I have a hobby".  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can talk about those.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Because the first one I had was like, um, online internet games.  And I was, like, I only really visit one and I rarely do that so we were like [LAUGH] -- she talked about her [inaudible] and we were just kind a, like, quiet so we just started talking about other things.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it was like pretty awkward, you know.  And I was like, "Oh, gosh, okay.  Ten minutes is taking eternity" you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  This one seems to take forever.  I thought that it would be pretty quick.
L:  Yeah, most people said how it goes by quick, you don't notice.  But I guess those are people who really, really like to talk and they just keep on and on, I guess. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  
R:  And I'm always better at listening.  I'm, you know, I --
L:  Yeah, me too.  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- try and make sure that I talk 'cause I know they say, "Well, both people need to talk".  Like, okay, I'm talking.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  You have to start talking about just anything, you know, and it's probably not anything to do with the survey but, I mean, I guess it still helps them with their research.  I don't know.
R:  'Cause I guess what they're after is, it's something with language and speaking and that sort of a thing.  Not --
L:  Yeah, I don't know --
R:  -- necessarily what we're talking --
L:  -- how they're going to --
R:  -- about.
L:  I don't know how they'll research that though.  I don't really understand it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess they'll just see how we respond to each other, like our answers or some-
