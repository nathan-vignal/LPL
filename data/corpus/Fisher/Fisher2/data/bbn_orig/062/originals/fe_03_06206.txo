R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello? [PAUSE]  I can barely hear you.
L:  I'm sorry.  Let me --
R:  It's okay.  I -- I'm not sure if it's the phone line or ...
L:  [NOISE] Is that better?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  I -- what are we supposed to do?
L:  I have no idea.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it said something about hobbies.
R:  Oh okay.  I was just new and I'm like, "Huh?"  And like, they just called and I'm like, "Okay, what am I doing?"
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  Do we just wait?
L:  Oh, uh, [inaudible] talk about the thing about hobbies.  Um, do you have one?
R:  [SIGH] Let's see.  I just, usually just, you know, the computer, I'm into that Refunding Makes Cents.
L:  Me too.
R:  Do you know what that is?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I stay home, I have a -- with all my kids.
L:  Uh.
R:  So it's -- that's really --
L:  Yeah, the kids are a hobby, aren't they?
R:  Yes.  And then I just -- whenever I get a chance I go, you know, to the Y. and work out, but that's the only time I have besides my, you know, when I get online for refunding.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- that takes a lotta chores here.
L:  [MN]
R:  Have you ever done this before?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay, so you're lost too!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, I'm sorry, I was like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I didn't know, you know, I had found it on the -- they posted it on Refunding.
L:  That's where I saw it.
R:  Oh you did? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I just -- I -- everybody kept talking about it and I finally got back -- was able to get back online and all of a sudden I thought, "Well, what is this?" and so I did it, after, you know, I watched about the Social Security number for a while.
L:  Right.
R:  And then I just thought, uh, "Well, I'll try". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's what I did.
R:  I mean, this is funny.  I never --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- met anybody from there be -- been online there before.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't think anybody else did it.
L:  Oh, I guess lots of people do.
R:  I know, reading it now.
L:  Yeah.  How long have you done the refunding?
R:  Huh?
L:  How long have you done the refunding?
R:  Not long, I had, um -- how did I ge- -- oh, I went on Ebay and I, um, if somebody had the magazine on there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  For sale, and I'm like, "No, I shouldn't do that".  And then I kept watching it and nobody bid on it and I said, "Well, for two dollars, you know" can't beat that, I might learn something.  So I bid on it, got it, and just read that, and then I -- I got online and joined.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I was just -- 'cause here where I live, there's not -- you know, you don't [inaudible] hear about the deals and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  And then when I got on there I was amazed.  I was like, "This is great".
L:  Yeah, and we can't find the forums here but we have double coupons.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Just the coupons though.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  In Ohio.
R:  Oh, see, and I'm in Columbus, Mississippi.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  And it's, um, the only thing I really have is like, [several inaudible words], KMarts and Walmart, [inaudible] like Penney's and Sears, but that's it.  I h- -- oh, [inaudible] but no [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  And we don't have a [inaudible], ours closed.  So I have one but it's about thirty miles away.
R:  Yeah.  Hm.  Um, I didn't know -- [MN] about the popcorn, I found that.
L:  [MN] Which --
R:  The one online where you win the Act Two popcorn. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I didn't do that.
R:  You didn't do that?
L:  No.
R:  Well, I had trouble where I couldn't print 'em, so I just emailed 'em and now I don't know what they're doing --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I'm getting -- I've got like, ten coupons in, and I'm like, "I only won --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- four".
L:  Uh.  Yeah, I don't --
R:  Yeah, I went to a -- the contest page --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I --
L:  I don't do a lot of the contests.
R:  See, I don't either, and I just thought -- I said, "Well, everybody else is doing it" and I missed the craft one everybody was doing.
L:  [MN]
R:  But I was wondering how many people really win.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I figure, you know, for free coupons, I could do that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah, the -- the contests, I know, they usually tell me, "Sorry, try again later" so I don't play. [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah, I only do the, you know, online [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- when I'm on, when I see it posted.  My husband, he just will not go with me anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He refuses.  He's just -- he says, "I can't believe they're letting you have this stuff for free" and I'm like, "But it's coupons, it's free".
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I pay tax.
L:  [MN]
R:  But then, if he can, you know, take it to the Fire Department and share, he likes that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] I wonder how long we're supposed to stay on line? [NOISE]
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  [NOISE] Are th- -- are they paying for this call?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]  And I was gonna say.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it don't cost me anything but [NOISE] ...
L:  Good thing too.
R:  Yes, Josh.  Cody, you're here today? [NOISE]  Okay.  I'll be there in a few minutes. [NOISE]  Go in mine, Mark's in the other one.  I didn't know I was babysitting today.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] For his -- the mom doesn't call and tell me, he just shows up [LAUGH].  And he's with my son today and I'm like, "Okay".
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE] And they're home from school now. [NOISE]  Josh!
L:  Oh, let's see, [several inaudible words] for refunding I like to -- I like to crochet but I don't do it anymore.
R:  See, I've done that but it's hard to, you know, find the patterns and things.
L:  Yeah.  Usually I start something and I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't finish it. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I've done that 'cause my -- go see what's wrong in the bathroom, Josh -- my [NOISE] gran- grandma taught -- she taught me a --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- little bit and now that she's not here no more it's hard for me to pick up the patterns.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I have to teach myself.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] And what makes it hard with me is I'm left handed. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's [several inaudible words].
R:  So other people can't teach me. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, supposedly though, if you sit in a mirror then you can watch --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- what they're doing backwards.
R:  I never tried that.  I should do that, that's a good idea.
L:  I don't know if it works though.
R:  I'll try it though. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Josh, I'm on the phone.
L:  Wow, I'm really bad at --
R:  Do you have children?
L:  I have two.
R:  [NOISE] How old?
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  One'll be fifteen in June and my other one's ten.
R:  Oh.  My -- I have him, he's seven and then I have my twenty -- she's gonna be twenty [NOISE].  [inaudible] well, she's home from college. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, and one's supposed to have a softball game tonight --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then we have a meeting at the same time.
R:  See, that's hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're doing softball right now and it's like, oh.  I'm like --
L:  I'm hoping for rain.
R:  I know, it's --
L:  Then I can do the other thing!
R:  It just started raining here, so I'm glad.  And then he does Cub Scouts, so it's like, it keeps me busy running.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And in between I jump online. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I deal with that and then I -- I work full time.
R:  Oh, so you're busy. [NOISE] 
L:  I'm supposed to be.  Right now I was napping.  I gue- -- does that count as a hobby ... napping? [LAUGH]
R:  Napping! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, and reading, I like to read.
R:  Yeah, reading's [inaudible] -- do you get online much? [NOISE]
L:  Every day.
R:  Every day?
L:  Yeah.  Usually I'm on now but I'm just laying here. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Um [NOISE] how long have you been doing the refunding?
L:  Um ... I've been on since my daughter was little, I think.
R:  [NOISE] Uh, do you --
L:  I did it for a while and then I got out of it and then I got back into it.
R:  [NOISE] Do you save much money doing it?
L:  I do but I just spend it in other places. [LAUGH]  But I do, I save at the grocery store.
R:  Are you able -- like, all the deals they post -- are you able to find them all where you're at?
L:  No.
R:  So I was wondering, 'cause I don't either.
L:  No, and the -- I don't do the test drives.
R:  I've --
L:  I've on- -- I've only done one.
R:  I signed up for some but I haven't got any of those.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they
