L:  Hi, I'm Mary Jane.
R:  Hi, this is Marlene.  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, hi, this is Marlene.
L:  Hi, Marlene, I'm Mary Jane.
R:  Okay, uh, the topic is hobbies.  Okay, do you wanna, um -- I'm just trying to think of hobbies that I have.  I don't even think I have any, uh, many hobbies.
L:  Oh, I like to read.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's my -- m- -- if -- if I would have a hobby that's --
R:  That's what you would pick.
L:  That would be my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's my leisure time, is reading.
R:  Right, right.
L:  What do you do --
R:  I -- I -- really, I mean, I watch TV in my leisure time, you know, other than taking care of my family.
L:  So your hobby is watching television.
R:  I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's kind of a crappy hobby I think but, um [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I used to love to read, you know, but, uh, once my kids were little and everything I really didn't have much time to read and I just -- I just guess I got used to that and I never picked it up other than reading magazines.
L:  Oh, and you haven't gone back to reading?
R:  No, not really.  I read lots of magazines but I really --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- don't sit and read books.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- have as much time as I would like to but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I watch TV, I like too 'cause it's what my family does.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But I would -- I would, uh, like to read and in fact I've been thinking about, um, [LIPSMACK] that I need a regular hobby again.
R:  Right, right.
L:  'Cause my family's older now and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I can do more.  Are your family -- is your family older?
R:  Yeah, yeah, my kids are, uh -- I have a fifteen year old, a twenty year old and a twenty four year old, so they are --
L:  They're old.
R:  -- older.  But I guess I just got into the habit of not reading and, uh, I'm usually -- I used to love to read, I used to belong to the, uh, summer book clubs and all these different --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- things, you know.
L:  Are you -- do you have any grandchildren yet?
R:  No, not yet.
L:  I was asking because I've been thinking -- in fact I just took a bunch of pictures -- I'm thinking about going back to what I used to like to do for a hobby, was photography.
R:  Oh, that's nice for [NOISE] --
L:  So I'm going to.  I just haven't had time.  I'm taking care --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of my elderly mother.
R:  Right.
L:  But -- but I'm, um, in fact I just took a bunch of pictures last night at my friend's graduation.  I was just taking 'em of my grandbabies and I thought I would --
R:  Right.
L:  -- start.  I'd like to, um, [LIPSMACK] I got a digital camera, I'd like to do the -- the pictures on the c- -- on the computer and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] start making things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- outta the pictures.
R:  Oh, that's a good idea.
L:  That's what -- because I was thinking, it's kinda funny they said it 'cause that's -- I -- just the last month I've been really trying to get to it 'cause they -- the other part of the question was, um, "Do you think everyone should have a hobby?"
R:  Right.
L:  And I was thinking that, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was important for me [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to start having a hobby again for --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for my time.
R:  Right, right.  I -- I -- really, I haven't thought about hobbies in a long time.  I -- I don't know, you know, I -- I don't do sports or anything like that and I do clip coupons, I enjoy that, but I don't know if I would consider that a hobby.
L:  Oh, I guess that is too.
R:  Clipping and filing and rebates and all that stuff.
L:  Yeah, I do that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You didn't by chance, uh, did you f- -- didn't by chance find out about this with F.W. did you?
R:  The what?
L:  About doing this -- the phone thing from, um, the f- -- did you find it out from the Internet?
R:  No, actually I found --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it out from my daughter because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- uh, I stay at home and she said, "Ma, you could earn a few bucks".  Some- somehow she got it on the Internet, I don't know how.
L:  Oh.  I ask because I guess that's my hobby too if you, uh, I don't think of that but the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- couponing and the rebating.
R:  The -- right, right, and, uh, 'cause we have double coupons and I find that fun, that I go and I spend very little money and I bags of groceries and --
L:  I guess that's mine too then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do too, we have the double coupons and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then I rebate.  And have you sc- -- have you got into the Internet with all the -- the, uh, special sales there?
R:  A little bit, you know, like, I -- I get emails from different companies and like Circuit City and Best Buy and all those things.
L:  Well you could get on those on the Internet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you get on, um, W.W.W. dot fat wallet --
R:  Fat Wallet.
L:  -- d- dot com.
R:  I --
L:  Fat Wallet.
R:  I gotta write this down.  'Cause [inaudible] I -- I actually -- I -- I -- I don't really surf the Internet or anything.
L:  Oh, you don't do it.
R:  But I -- I do go online and I check the email and stuff and --
L:  Oh, 'cause they --
R:  -- a little bit.
L:  -- [inaudible] tell you like, all these deals.
R:  Fat Wallet dot com.  So I don't know if that would be a hobby 'cause I -- I don't surf the Net really other than, you know, like I'll go on store websites and different things.  I enjoy that, I guess that's a little bit of a hobby.
L:  Well, I do that, I do -- I guess that that is my hobby, I get on there [MN] and it's, uh, I go to the sites --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that have the -- they tell you a lot of rebate deals.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  So that --
R:  Oh, Fat Wallet.
L:  So that --
R:  I gotta check that out.
L:  So that you can do really good on your rebating.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And, um --
R:  [NOISE] I --
L:  -- that's become a major hobby.  I guess I never --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think of that as a hobby.
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's, uh, become a major one for me.
R:  But I guess anything that you enjoy doing, you know, it could be a hobby I guess.
L:  I -- I needed something a little more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I thought I could do --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the photography 'cause I needed something a little more crea- --
R:  Cre- -- I know, I know, yeah.  But, uh, I don't know, it's interesting.  And, uh [NOISE], I guess that is a hobby. [LAUGH]  You know, I'd really never thought of hobbies un- until I got this phone call and I'm waiting for you to come on I'm thinking, "Oh my God, I don't have hobbies".  This is like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- "How am I gonna talk to somebody?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then I was thinking more about it I guess anything you enjoy and you can devote a little time to, I guess that's a hobby.
L:  Yeah, I think it's important for people -- I think it's maybe -- I think I need to do something a little different than the rebating or the couponing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- though, because I think I need something just a little -- I think it's important to kinda get back into touch with things that you've kinda lost about yourself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that hobbies can --
R:  [MN]
L:  That's what my thought was.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I thought something that's just my time, that's something --
R:  That's something for you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.  Whether I'll ever --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- get -- really get to it I [LAUGH] don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Especially if I have whole b- bunch of rebates in there, they have to be used by then! [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  But the photography, at least you've been thinking about it, if you -- which is more than I've been doing.
L:  Well maybe this --
R:  Thinking --
L:  -- will start you thinking.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I used to, I mean, when I was a teenager and a young adult I used to love needlepoint, I used to do a lotta needlepoint.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I don't know if I have the patience anymore to do it.
L:  Well you won't know till you try.
R:  Or -- or the walls to hang things on! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well you can do it as gifts.
R:  Yeah, 'cause the --
L:  I tried that but I haven't finished any of 'em 'cause I -- I don't really know what I'm doing. [SIGH]
R:  Right.  See --
L:  I tried the needlepoint.
R:  Oh that, I -- I did that really well and they were beautiful, the pieces.
L:  Oh.
R:  And in fact I turned my -- my father onto doing it and my father was like, big into needlepoint.  He had a heart disease and it like, kept him busy and not smoking.  His hands were busy, you know, and, uh, I guess it was all about hobbies for a while.
L:  That sounds like it would be a good hobby for you.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.
L:  I guess they tell us when the ten minutes is up, do you think?
R:  Yeah.  I -- this is the second call --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm on.  Last week I got another call and they do, they come and tell -- tell you --
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  -- you know, that your ten minutes are up because --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I didn't know how it worked.  This is your first call then?
L:  Yes, this is my first call.
R:  Oh okay, and how did you find about -- out about it?
L:  Oh, like I, uh, on the Internet.
R:  On the Internet.  They sent it to you?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I -- I've heard about it from -- from a friend --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then I did it through the Internet.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  In fact I was just telling my daughter about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when they called.
R:  Yeah.  So, uh, [several inaudible words] --
L:  Well, maybe you think this might motivate you, to maybe think about your needlework?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.
L:  And you could do it while you're watching television.
R:  That I could do, yeah.
L:  That's why --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- I tried it, 'cause I needed to lose some weight, so I was doing it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- while my family watched TV, to keep my hands busy.
R:  [inaudible] right, right.
L:  But I haven't finished an- not one of 'em that I started.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  But I don't really know what I'm doing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well you need --
L:  And my b- --
R:  -- need to go to like, a sewing store and where they have classes or things.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's how I learned --
L:  That's a good idea.
R:  -- they went and they showed me a little bit and, you know, it's really not difficult and they come out, they're so beautiful.  Some of them are.  I mean, my father did one that's over his bed, it must be four feet long and like a few feet wide, it was --
L:  Oh, that's huge.
R:  -- uh, beautiful.  He says -- I mean, he did bigger things than I did.  But, uh, they come out really beautiful.
L:  You could do 'em through your children's homes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Use 'em for a nice gift.
R:  I don't know.  My -- my daughter's the only who's not here but I don't know if she would hang up my needlepoint.
L:  Oh, she probably -- it would probably, uh, be a wonderful keepsake for her.
R:  Yeah, that it would be, you know --
L:  You know.
R:  But, uh --
L:  I'd love to have one from my mom.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My sister's made me one in fact, it says, "Home Sweet Home".  It's been in my house for a long time.
R:  That must be beautiful, yeah.  But, I mean, we've done religious pieces and we've done florals and we've done all these different things.  But for some reason I think I have more patience then, I don't know why, you know, it's, uh --
L:  Well, you just have to give it a go.  That's kinda how I'm feeling about my photography.
R:  Right.
L:  It's more of a, "Oh, I used to do that then, I'm probably --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- not the same" and this and that.  I thought, you know, I need to just give it a try.
R:  You know, it's so different than when you're younger and y- -- and really you had your own time, and before kids or anything else.  I mean, once you have your family, who really has times for their own hobbies?
L:  Yeah, that's how I --
R:  As women an- anyway, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe men do, you know, but --
L:  That's how I was thinking but that's why I thought why I need to do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, absolutely.  Like to find a piece of yourself again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh --
L:  Something that's just me.
R:  And -- and I -- it's funny, you were thinking about it before this call and I haven't thought about it at all until this call, and now I'm thinking, my goodness, you know, really, what have I done for myself lately?  Something that I enjoy.
L:  Even the rebating isn't really for me, it's -- I get for everybody else.
R:  Yeah.  I do enjoy it though, you know, I get a kick out of it for something to --
L:  I get a kick, I have to admit, I get a kick out of it.
R:  Yeah, yeah, although --
L:  And the -- and the -- and the savings.
R:  Right.  Going to the store and like --
L:  But it's not really relaxing.
R:  Uh, well --
L:  Is it relaxing for you?
R:  I don't -- I -- I don't know if it's relaxing but it's not not relaxing, you know what I mean?  I enjoy it, so -- it's really not relaxing.
L:  It's kinda hectic for me.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But, uh --
L:  So --
R:  Maybe that's what I'm looking for though, that
