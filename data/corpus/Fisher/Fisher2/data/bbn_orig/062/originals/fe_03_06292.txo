R:  Yes, I did.
L:  It's on tonight.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think --
L:  A lotta people ...
R:  -- I could kiss some guy in a mask.  [LAUGH]  I'm sorry.  That grosses me out, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] It does.  It -- it -- it is weird.  I mean, you don't know what they look like.
R:  You know?
L:  They could look like anything and you're kissing them and -- I mean, there's a lotta that going on with the shows now, those, um, reality shows they call 'em.
R:  And normally I don't get attached to 'em, but I did American Idol this year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just really great.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But anyway I did it.
L:  [LAUGH] Once you start watching the shows you get into it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But sometimes you almost have to make yourself start watching it.  I do and then -- and then it -- it starts to get in- interesting and I wanna see what happens next.  So --
R:  Of course you do.
L:  -- I have to see the next [LAUGH] -- I just have to see that next show.  But what I did miss, um -- I missed the last episode of, um -- that, um -- what's that show --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the guy who was supposed to have been a millionaire?
R:  The Bachelor.
L:  Um, no, it was another one that was on Fox.
R:  Oh, uh, Joe -- Joe Millionaire.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Joe Millionaire.  [LAUGH]  That was on -- I missed the last episode.  I wanted to see that part when he told the ladies that he wasn't actually a millionaire and I missed that.  I wanted to see it so bad.
R:  Oh, it was so cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You didn't watch that?
L:  I didn't see that.
R:  It was so cool.
L:  I watched -- I watched ...
R:  It was like okay [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm with you and you're not a millionaire.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they have a new one coming on now and ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, yes.  It's -- it's -- it's great.  The girl if she can get picked she gets a million dollars, but the guy doesn't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- know it.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's too cool.
L:  So, okay [COUGH] -- okay, the -- the guy that picks the girl, she wins a million dollars, would they still stay together?
R:  Uh, probably not.  [LAUGH]
L:  Or is it just -- is this a game for the money?
R:  Oh -- oh, the females are doing it for the money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Would you not do it for a --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- million dollars?
L:  I know they're doing it for the money, but they don't ...
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would.
L:  Right.  I think everybody would.  [LAUGH]
R:  A million dollars, uh-huh.
L:  I think anyone would, but -- so, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire was a disaster.  I didn't care a less.
R:  Well, the ring looked good, but the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- relationship was not that great.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  It -- it never started to begin with though.  I mean, there was nothing for 'em to really, you know ...?
R:  Okay.  Remind me again.  Why am I talking to you on a cell phone?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  We're supposed to be talking about hobbies.
R:  Oh, okay.  Hobbies.
L:  Hobbies.
R:  Uh, can I make some up?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.  I'm not sure.  Um, I've already said my hobbies pretty much.
R:  Uh, let's see.  Uh, spending time with my children.
L:  Oh, that's another one of mine.
R:  That sounds dorky.  [LAUGH]
