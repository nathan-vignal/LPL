L:  When you were small?
R:  Yeah.  I was three.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it's just been -- it's been my calling really.
L:  See.  Yeah.  You were gifted.  So, they probably saw you dancing around the house and thought they'd channel all that energy into -- into something and then it's really neat that it's turned out to be a hobby and, uh, you know, a profession also.
R:  Yeah.  I think I was getting on their nerves kinda.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  Like oh, this kid!
L:  Oh, wow!  Oh, gosh!  I have hobbies, but they're not in dance.  I, uh -- I love to work in the garden.  I find that very therapeutic.  I love hiking and -- and ...
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.  And camping and I sew and, um, craft and, you know?  God, I think everybody needs to have an outlet.
R:  Yeah.  I ...
L:  You know, they've gotta have something to do to -- to -- you know?
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I sew also.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Mhm.  My Mom taught me to sew when I was really young --
L:  Oh.  My ...
R:  -- and I love to sew.
L:  Yeah.  My mother did too, you know, and unfortunately not a lotta -- well, I know not a lotta young kids nowadays -- you know, that's not something that's been passed down to them.
R:  Right.
L:  Like cooking or sewing like, you know, it was and, uh, you know, it's really -- it's really a shame, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh ... Yeah.
R:  I have a friend who knits --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, like that's her big hobby --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and she taught my daughter --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and all of their frien- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- her -- her daughter goes to dance class with my daughter --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she taught all of the little girls at the dance school how to knit.
L:  Oh, that is so cool.
R:  Isn't that cool?
L:  Yeah.  Now, my mother she crocheted, she quilted, she made beautiful, beautiful quilts and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's so neat because I lost her last year and --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
L:  -- now when I look all around my house, you know, I have all these wonderful things that she made --
R:  That she made.  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  -- and taught me and it's just like she's in every room in my home, you know, and, um, she was a wonderful crocheter and I tried to learn that, but I'm left handed and -- and I just finally gave up on it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I bought the -- I'm gonna learn to crochet left handed and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, nope, didn't work.  I ...
R:  Did you find it difficult 'cause you were left handed?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Really?
L:  Totally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, um, I thought oh, well, it's not like I don't have a million other things to do, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So ... But, uh, yeah --
R:  You --
L:  -- I just ...
R:  -- you said you garden too?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  I'm getting ready to get into that.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I just had --
L:  Now, vegetable or just for ...?
R:  -- my yard redone, like re-landscaped --
L:  Uh-huh.  [MN]
R:  -- and I'll have like room for a garden.
L:  Oh, that'll be so neat.  Now, we just downsized.  My husband and I are fifty and the kids left home and so we, um, had, uh, a house and, uh, five acres --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and so we sold that and I am, for the first time in my life, in a subdivision and I don't know how I'm adjusting to that.  But, uh, you know, I've got a little patch on the one side because I had, um -- at my old house I had half an acre of wild flowers --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and then, of course, we grew vegetables and things like that and, um, I told him, I said, you know, I just got -- you know, I tried container on the back porch, you know, doing a lotta container --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, gardening and then, um, I just took one side of the house.  The other side's very manicured and it's got, you know, the bushes and things and, uh, we're been -- we've been on the other -- I call it sunny side and -- and shady side [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the shady side I've got a little patch, it looks like in the country, you know, I just have to have a place to get out there and dig and -- and, you know, I -- I love it.  There's just nothing like it.  It just clears your mind and, you know, you can really just think and be alone with nature and -- and it -- you know, to me it's just awesome --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  So, um, get ya some books, you know, go to the library and just, you know, kinda decide what -- you know, I've got a wonderful perennial bed and I bought a book that, um, I got at the garden center --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's perennials for the Ohio, um --
R:  Area?
L:  -- area --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and that was the neatest book and I've got tons of books, but to me that was the neatest one and it broke it down in there about how you can garden and have something blooming every month into winter, and so you've got color all summer and into fall and winter --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and, um, I got it at our local garden center and it -- to me, it -- it is just the neatest book, it is, you know?  I -- I just love -- I love digging in the dirt.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's awesome.
L:  And seeing something, you know, that you've planted, you know?
R:  Right.  You cultivated.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I took little Dixie cups and just put seeds -- I started them from seeds --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I had, um, once belonged to a club, the bulb club, and we would just go and exchange flowers and seeds like they did, you know, years and years and years ago when our grandparents were, um, you know, into that.  And so I took in just -- soaked seeds overnight, you know, cut little holes in 'em and soaked 'em overnight in -- in Dixie cups and planted 'em and -- and there was only two that didn't come up and the rest all came up and -- and just to watch that it's like oh, wow!  It's so neat, you know?  So, I went and got another -- other seeds and -- and tried it again.  So, I'm waiting for those to come up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, just to see, you know?  But I -- I enjoy so much gardening.  I mean, that's -- that's a wonderful hobby.
R:  Yeah.  My grandmother used to garden, like when I was younger --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we had a really -- we had a really big house.  I don't know like how much land we had, but we had a really big house and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she would get out there with all her gardening tools --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she would plant stuff and she had -- we even had -- she even had a -- a little section that was a vegetable garden --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she'd grow her vegetables and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that was just like what she did all day --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause, you know, she was retired and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- she didn't have a job and she wasn't responsible for us, we were teenagers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and now she lives in Wisconsin --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and it's so cold she says --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- most of the year --
L:  Yeah.  No doubt.
R:  -- that when it -- when it does get warm she breaks outta that house and gets into the garden so fast.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah.
R:  So ...
L:  Now, my parents they always had -- had a garden -- into cans.  My Mom would make us -- you know, we'd have to snap the beans and -- and, um, shave the corn off the cob and, you know, do the tomatoes and oh, as we kids we hated it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We'd just whine and carry on and, you know [LAUGH], well, you can't get away from your raising because I -- we just go and, um, buy, you know, like a bushel of beans or whatever and put 'em up and start -- you know, we -- we continue, my sisters and I to can --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, even today it's so funny 'cause nothing tastes as good as a big old tomato out of the garden --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  When it's like ...
L:  -- and a big salt shaker.
R:  Yes.  When it's just so fresh and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you've just picked it.  I -- I feel sorry 'cause like I grew up, um, in the beginning -- like we moved to Pennsylvania when I was fifteen.  So, I grew up in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- New York.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Right in the heart of the city.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no.
R:  In Manhattan.  So, you know, like I -- I never had even fathomed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything like having a garden --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we moved out to Pennsylvania and -- you know, in the summer ...
L:  And got land?
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You know, but ...
R:  I can't imagine like somebody never having that experience in their life.
L:  Oh, me either.  Me either.
R:  Just always living in the city with concrete and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, no grass, no flowers.  I can't imagine.
L:  I'd have to have me some containers.  I'd be -- I'd be the best container gardener --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?  I'd have all these -- 'cause you can grow tomato plants, you know, just put one right down in a flower pot and stake it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and there you go.  So, it's a good, you know ...?  But, uh, yeah, I -- I know.  I -- I can't imagine going up to the rooftop and blacktop, you know, not having grass and -- and ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know?  [NOISE]  It just seems like sometimes you just take so much for granted.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  It's ha- -- people do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and especially if you don't know the other way.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  You know what I mean?  If you've never experienced --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you know, the other way --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- then ...
L:  Now, my husband he would much rather be out on the golf course, that's his hobby.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's like you -- that's too much work, you know?  He says, "I'll -- I'll go to the golf course and, uh, you can just piddle in the yard".  [LAUGH]  But I -- I -- you know, to me it is, it's my hobby, I just love the flowers and things, digging in the dirt.
