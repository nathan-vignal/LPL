L:  Andrea Bates.
R:  Deborah Raffle.
L:  Can we talk now?
R:  Oh, I didn't --
L:  [MN]
R:  I thought [MN] it was actually a recording! [LAUGH]
L:  I did -- I did too!  I was like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- "Okay!" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All right.
L:  What -- what did she say, hobbies?
R:  Yeah, that's the topic, hobbies.
L:  Oh okay.  What's your hobby?
R:  Uh, my hobby is I like to read.
L:  Read?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What kind of reading?
R:  Um, all kinds.  [MN]
L:  All kinds?
R:  Yeah, all kinds.
L:  Who's your favorite author?
R:  Um, I'm not gonna say I have like, favorites --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause since I have all kinds which, like, includes magazines --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, newspapers, books, um, [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just, uh, from going to the library to getting my own books --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, so I'm not gonna say just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have a favorite author 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't really stick to like, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like author favorite, like how some people -- how some people that like, "Oh, I like Ludlum" and they'll read all his books.  I'm not like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But anyway, enough about me, what about your hobby?
L:  Oh, I would think mine was probably golf.
R:  Golf?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  I like to play golf, so ...
R:  Do you play a lot?
L:  Um, I don't get to play as much as I want to because I have a two year old that I stay home with and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, you know, I have to be with him all day, so I don't get to go play as much as I want to, but --
R:  Well, how did --
L:  -- I like to play in, like, golf tournaments and stuff.
R:  Oh.  How did you get started in -- in golf?
L:  My, uh, dad has always played.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And when I was little he bought me a golf set and took me out to the golf course and we started playing --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- together and then, um, when I got to high school I played on the team.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I've just played since then.  That -- that's just the one thing that my dad and I enjoy doing together, is playing golf.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So --
R:  Well maybe you can introduce your two year old to golf at some time.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we, uh, this year we bought him one of those little plastic golf sets, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- maybe he'll like it.  But he's more into [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know my brother plays golf and my cousin plays golf so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess the only golf I've kinda played is mini golf, miniature golf.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And that's pretty much fun.  I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I liked that.  So --
L:  That's tedious because putting is the hardest part to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh?  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  I -- I think one of the questions they had on there was can a person have more than one hobby?  Did -- did you hear that?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I do believe they can.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Do you?
R:  Oh definitely, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- w- I mean, the world is too diverse to maybe, you know, just have one hobby but, you know, you can have the hobby that you really, really love to do, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, yeah.
L:  W- w- did they also ask, uh, "Do you think a person needs a hobby?"
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
L:  I don't remember that -- if they asked that.
R:  Needs a hobby.  Um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I didn't quite hear it  like that, if they needed a hobby or if they needed more than one hobby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  S- something to that effect.  So, yeah, um, I mean, I would have more than one hobby, I mean, do you?  I'd --
L:  Oh yeah, pro- -- yeah.  I want to do all kinds of things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, probably golf though is my -- my number one favorite, but I like to read too.  I'm not a -- a avid read but I do like to read some.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like to go out to eat. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you wanna call that a hobby! [LAUGH]
R:  It c- -- it can be, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, and I guess my child is my hobby too.
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  You know.
R:  I mean, uh --
L:  Doing things with him.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I --
L:  Do you -- [SIGH] --
R:  My cats are my hobby, so I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I love animals and so I'm -- I'm kinda really into that and I -- I like to dance and I like to watch movies as a hobby and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, um, [LIPSMACK] and sometimes [MN] I don't know, it's like, what's better, going to the movie or get -- or purchasing a movie.  So that -- that's kinda like a hobby and, um, [LIPSMACK] on the computer, that's -- that's kinda like a hobby.
L:  Oh yeah.  Computers can be a hobby.  I'm not into being on a computer all the time though.
R:  Mm.
L:  I like to check my, uh, email --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and maybe play a game or two and then I'm pretty much off.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I just don't have time to just sit on a computer and it also bothers my eyes, so --
R:  Yeah, it can.  I- it can --
L:  So --
R:  -- be bothersome, you know, so -- and I [MN] it can -- I know what you mean about the email because I have one server and it just so happened that I mistakenly gave my name out and I get all this spam.
L:  Oh.
R:  And by the time I return I have a ton of email that I have to delete.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So by the time I can do that to maybe get to where the page or surf that I want -- I like to clean out the email first --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- 'cause you just never know, uh, about the virus.  But, yeah, I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have a few games of mine that are like hobbies, uh, to -- to play.  But, I mean, to clear [LIPSMACK] some of this -- the things I've downloaded d- to be able to get them on there now.
L:  Yes! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so, um, I really enjoy a particular game and that's kinda like a hobby of mine on -- and it's so addicting that I [MN] -- I'll be like, "Oh, one more game, that's it" and then I find I'm playing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- another and I'm like [LAUGH] --
L:  What game is it?
R:  It's called Block, uh, Block Breaker.  [LIPSMACK] And --
L:  Block Breaker.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's a co- color coded games and the blocks together and you can, uh, uh, blow them up and if you have a clear board you win and if you may have somewhat --
L:  I think I've played something similar to that.
R:  Yeah.  I really enjoy that game and someti- -- I mean, I can -- I've spent a lot of time doing that and today I was like, "Oh, let me -- let me get off, I have to go" and I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I did it!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was like -- 'cause then my cats were like, "Meow!"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, "You're on too long!"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh, yeah, th- that's so much fun for me.  And [LIPSMACK] sometimes cooking is a hobby for me but, uh --
L:  Yeah, I like to cook.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like to, um, I get that, uh, Taste of Home cooking magazine.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  And I like to try new recipes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I -- I do too.  Do --
L:  My husband doesn't always like it, 'cause when he sees the cookbook out he's like, "Uh oh, that means you're trying stuff --"
R:  [MN] Like, "Don't try anything new on me" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or, uh, "What is this?"  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  He's -- he's afraid he's gonna have some kind of strange [inaudible] that he's not gonna like! [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I do too.  I -- I like to bake more and, like, cookies and things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which I've really gotten out of [NOISE] but, I mean, I -- I -- I even have a cookie mix and I haven't done it yet and I need to 'cause it was like, i- it's just sitting there so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, things from the cookbook, I enjoy that, so -- and, you know, just getting the ingredients, I'm fine if I can just get everything together and I can --
L:  [NOISE] [NOISE]
R:  -- do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  As long as it didn't have weird things that you had to look at specialty stores for or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- things like that.  I don't like to have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go look for the ingredients, I want 'em to be at my grocery store.
R:  [SIGH] Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, one of my other hobbies that I like to do is, like, riding my bike.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, um, [SIGH] I -- I need to get it -- well, I have a flat tire so -- but I'm going to take it and get it all fixed up and, um, 'cause I live near a beach and so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I wanna start doing that before it gets, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before summer's gone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I guess another hobby, I -- I like to travel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't get to do a whole lot but I do --
R:  Really?
L:  -- like to travel.
R:  Yeah, I like to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- travel too.
L:  I've been, um, to London.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then, of course, my parents live in Saudi Arabia, so I've been there.
R:  Oh.  Oh wow.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] then, you know, d- we go skiing and we're gonna go to the beach this summer and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and different places like that.  But my goal was, before I die I'd like to see every state in the United States.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So ...
R:  I -- I think you can do that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if you --
L:  If I can get my husband up and motivated! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, yeah.  I mean, traveling, i- it can be a good hobby and, uh, 'cause I -- I work at traveling, that -- that's what I do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So it's like, um, it can be tiresome but it -- it can be fun at the same time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So just, you know, to, you know, be prepared, take medications and whatever, the things you want, and maybe not pack so much 'cause it's like, um, like I have a girlfriend and when she would visit me she would like, buy -- she would buy things before she would go and then of course she wants to go -- come shopping.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's like, the idea maybe is to have either an empty suitcase or buy a suitcase! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So all the stuff that you do buy is not gonna be a problem when you get ready to leave.
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah, so, um, yeah, traveling, it -- it can be a good hobby and I've -- I owe a few visits to family and friends and it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, I keep looking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at my calendar and say, "Okay, maybe I can do a flight next month" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, um, hopefully I can.  It's just, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, [SIGH] um, and sometimes you get tired of traveling.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I know 'cause I -- I work at it, so it's like --
L:  Right.
R:  It's just kinda like, um -- and it shouldn't be that hard for me a- and it -- I -- I guess -- I think I make it harder than what it is just packing a suitcase and going, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause like I said, if -- maybe if I need something that I've left -- 'cause everyone loves to shop at, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- shopping centers when they, you know, travel.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  And, uh, shopping is a hobby of mine at times.
L:  My mother likes to shop.  Now, I'm not a shopper.
R:  Oh?
L:  I -- I like to make a list.
R:  [MN]
L:  Let's get my list and let's go home.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But my mother loves to shop.
R:  Okay.
L:  And she's -- she likes to, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- she likes to go to the trades days and, you know, do antique shopping and stuff like that, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, [LIPSMACK] I do what I have to do and then [LAUGH] I -- I don't do any over and beyond.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I do shop with her.  She --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- likes me to go with her, so I do go with her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I usually have to have a purpose to be in town.
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, I -- I can be a list, I mean, you know, have a list and do that but I -- I mean, I've shopped online and I've shopped, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] well, in the stores.  I mean, like, if I go I'm really looking for something, I'm not just, you know, there waddling my time away, it's -- it's, you know, it's -- it's productive, it's not like, "Oh let me just --"
