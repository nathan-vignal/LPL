R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Dianna.
R:  Hi.  I'm Marilyn.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, I guess they said the topic ...
L:  I'm from New York.
R:  Oh, I'm from Wisconsin.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  How's your weather there?
L:  How's Wisconsin?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, rainy.
L:  The weather here ...  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Cold and thundering over here.  Please!
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hobbies.  Hobbies.
R:  Hobbies, yeah.
L:  Hm.  Let's see.  Oh, my God!  I -- I ...
R:  Well, I really don't have one.  I've too busy chasing --
L:  You know what?
R:  -- my four year old around.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it would be nice to have one.
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't really have a hobby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I have a lot of things that I do like to do.
R:  Right, okay.
L:  Um, so, um, maybe that's considered a hobby.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think it probably would be 'cause I do a lotta -- well, maybe not 'cause I do a lotta things too, but I don't consider it a hobby.
L:  Right.  Right.  Me either.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  Like -- like, uh, for example -- and this is gonna sound so geeky -- like, um, it used to be a big hobby of mine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to go to the park and see pigeons.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That would be nice [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause they have quite a few in New York, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yes.  And a lotta people think that they're such nuisances, but I'm like oh, they gotta eat --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I wanna fed them.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yes.
L:  I mean, is -- is that considered a hobby?
R:  I think it would be considered a hobby.  Um, I used to, uh, bake and decorate cakes, like for family members.  I would make them like in different shapes.  So --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- that was a hobby a long time ago.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  But, um ...
L:  That's more like artistic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I -- I don't do it too much anymore.  I just don't have the time.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.  Yes.
L:  You said you have a four year old?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  So, is a hobby maybe taking him to the park?
R:  Um [NOISE] ...
L:  That's not a hobby, right?
R:  I -- I don't think so.  I think it's more of a chore.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let me see.  Oh, God!  You know, I sound like such a geek.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, a- -- like another hobby, um, used to be like feeding the stray -- the stray cats around my neighborhood.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  I just felt like a weirdo.  I'm feeding the -- the pigeons --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- feeding the cats.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they have to eat.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So, do you take in any stray animals?  That would probably be a hobby.
L:  You know what?  I actually have.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I -- I truly have.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right.  Right.  Um, I -- I have so -- and -- and -- and, um, I mean, I have a, um -- oh, I'm gonna sound like such a weirdo --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I'm -- I'm twenty nine years old.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  People always say I look younger and I -- I live in Manhattan, but I'm lucky to have a large apartment --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I actually have taken in three stray cats.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Two -- right, the first one was -- was, um -- was a present.  The second one I adopted.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the other three were literally from the street.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I guess ...  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that would be a hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, like my hobby is picking up stray cats.
R:  You're just compelled to take care of them.
L:  Right.  I mean, you know -- I mean, it's -- it's really -- it's funny because you -- you know, you see me and you wouldn't expect me to be sitting with like the old ladies at the park feeding pigeons or --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- taking care of cats.  So, it's really funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!  No, just a caring person.  Yeah.
L:  Thanks.  So, I guess, you know, neither of us has a hobby.  Well ...
R:  Right.  Right.  But I do think people should have a hobby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think to give 'em some type of outlet.
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Um, for a little bit I got -- you said something about baking for ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Very briefly I got into baking, but you can't really call it baking 'cause it was just basically buying those boxes --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and just following the directions.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right. 
L:  So ...
R:  Well, that's still baking 'cause some people can't do that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and it was fun.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it was fun to actually make something.
R:  Right.
L:  Right.  But I -- I -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- couldn't imagine having the discipline to make -- like, you said, you were making cakes for people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  Yeah.  I ...
R:  Yeah, 'cause I made 'em in all different shapes.
L:  Wow!
R:  Um, a friend of mine's, uh, Dad retired and he was a taxi driver.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, I made the cake in the shape of a taxi.
L:  Oh, my God!  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  It was time consuming.  But --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- you know, the -- the end product really turns out nice.
L:  That's amazing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How did you learn that?
R:  Well, I -- I don't know.  Probably just from watching my Mom.  She did a lotta baking and was always in the kitchen.
L:  Oh, that's so great.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, my Mom -- that -- I guess that was my Mom's hobby.  She was a working mother, but she also --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- liked, um, to make everything from -- from scratch.
R:  Right.
L:  And do you know that I never picked it up?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Never picked up anything.
R:  I picked up some things, but there's some other things I wish I had of picked up, but didn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because my mother did a lotta baking from scratch and meals and things like that, you know?
L:  Well, that's amazing.  [LAUGH]  No --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I never -- I never quite picked up the flair for cooking.  But, I mean, you know, luckily I can cook.  That was another hobby for a while.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I was, uh -- I wasn't working, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I just, you know, liked to cook every single day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just would have a meal ready for my boyfriend.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And it was fun.  It was fun preparing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the meal.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, you really don't think of -- you know, especially like friends my age --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't think of us like preparing meals and that was fun.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yes.
L:  So, you know, that was a hobby.
R:  I -- I do that every day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, um, I don't work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm a housewife.  I'm home every day.  So --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- when the kids come home on the bus and -- and when the little one is here he gets breakfast, lunch and dinner.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, it's like I'm preparing meals all day in --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in between chasing him.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's nice.  No, I don't have any children yet.  But, you know, I think that would be great to do.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  They -- they would become my hobby.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  And they're a joy to have around.
L:  They would become my hobby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's so nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how many do you have?
R:  I have three.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  How old are they?
R:  Uh, twenty --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- twenty, thirteen and four.  A big gap.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, real big gap.
L:  Wow!  He kinda just snuck in there.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  He sure did.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  That's amazing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, my brother and I there's a thirteen year, um, difference between him and me.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  My Mom was thirty -- he's just turned seventeen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my Mom was thirty seven when she had him and seventeen years ago thirty seven year old women it wasn't very common.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, now -- now it's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, women are in their late thirties early forties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're just starting to have babies.  So ...
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So ...  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I was -- I was thirty seven when I had him.
L:  Wow!
R:  So --
L:  Oh, that's [inaudible].
R:  -- there's -- there's a big gap.  There's ten years between my two youngest and, uh, six years between the middle and the oldest.
L:  Wow, that's neat.
R:  So, that's a big gap.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's amazing.
R:  So, I tell 'em all the time they're all just single kids.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's how I feel with my brother and I, you know, I feel like we were raised differently even though we come from the same mother.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  And we were -- yeah, we weren't even really raised together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I was already -- yeah, off --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- off to college when he was just six years old or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- five or something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  That's a big gap.
L:  -- he was my hobby when he was a baby.
R:  What was that?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, he was?
L:  My brother.
R:  [LAUGH] he was your hobby.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  He -- he was like my little -- you know, he was like my little tail just, you know, following me everywhere and I used to love to take him to the park and ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Take him everywhere.  So ...
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So, I mean, I -- I just -- I don't know.  I guess my definition of hobby is just stuff that I enjoy doing rather --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than like something that you do.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.  I don't really know what the definition ...
R:  Right.  Well, I would say something that you enjoy doing.  I -- I don't think there should be anything set --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, to say -- you know, this isn't a hobby, but this is.  If you enjoy doing it as well as the next person it should be considered a hobby.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the thing with me is that I enjoy doing a lot of things.
R:  Right.
L:  A lot of different things.  You know, I'm just happy to be here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm just happy to be alive.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean, I get happy just dancing -- I love to dance too.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  You know?  So ...
R:  Well, that's a hobby too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, you know, I guess it's in my blood.  I'm Spanish.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, when music comes on and I'm just dancing away.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I was just dancing like half an hour ago actually.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  The music came on ...
R:  Well, it gives you a lotta energy.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  I guess so, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm -- yeah, I'm a little tired.  I -- I just started a new job and -- and ...
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  But ...  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  So ...
R:  Well, congratulations on your new job.
L:  Oh, thanks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But frankly I'd rather be a homemaker.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  Well, that's hard work though.  I've been doing it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for twenty five years.  That's hard work.
L:  Yeah.  But it's the most --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- important job, you know?
R:  Yes, it is.  It is.
L:  It really is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you know, you -- homemakers they really don't get enough credit.
