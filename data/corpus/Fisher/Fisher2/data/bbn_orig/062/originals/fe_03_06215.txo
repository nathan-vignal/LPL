L:  Hi, my name is Jackie.
R:  And my name is Wendy.
L:  Hi, how are you, Wendy?
R:  I'm doing pretty good.
L:  All right.  Um, w- would you like to go first?
R:  Okay.  Um, some of my hobbies are, I coupon, I do a lot of stuff on the computer, on the Internet, I love to read books, I love to listen to country music and I do refunding.
L:  Right.  My hobby is, um, I live in Manhattan so I look in the back of the Village Voice and since I'm a homemaker and I have a daughter, I like to do surveys.  I like to go to various places and do like, smoking surveys and different types of surveys.  Uh, so that's one of my hobbies, which is meeting people and doing surveys.  And sometimes I get financially compensated and sometimes I don't, but I have fun doing that as a hobby and I also like, uh, window shopping a lot, even if I can't afford the things I enjoy to window shop.  I enjoy sitting in the park and walking my dog, and just normal everyday things.  And also one of my biggest hobbies is shopping.
R:  And my name is Wendy and I live in Delaware but I'm in Scottsville, Virginia on vacation.
L:  Oh, that's very, very nice.  My mother came from Virginia.  Alexandria, Virginia.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  And what took you up to Manhattan?
L:  Well, I used to live in Brooklyn [LIPSMACK] and then we moved over to Manhattan because, you know, my mother got sick and she needed the hospitals in Manhattan, and then my mother had passed on, you know, and then I stayed in Manhattan.  So, that, you know, that's what it was.  And then Manhattan is, um, it's very, very nice to walk around, there's always something to do and something to see.  Yesterday when I was walking with my daughter home from school there was this guy trying to climb a building.
R:  Ooh! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he had a rope and he had some kind of a seat, he was sitting in a seat, and a guy was trying to help him up, it was like a harness, help him up a building.  I also like thrift shops and churches.  You can find very many interesting things.  We have a lotta thrift shops over here in Manhattan in churches, and you can find nice clothing, um, slightly used, you can wash in a washing machine and then it still comes out beautiful, and they're very vintage clothing, so I also like, you know, thrift shopping also.
R:  I bet you find a lot with the, um, price tags still on.
L:  Right, uh-huh, the price tags are still on.  I was able to get a set of Ralph Lauren sheets, beautiful sheets, and believe it or not, I got them for four dollars -- four dollars a piece.
R:  I need to come up and live with you and go with you to these places!  You get some good deals it sounds like.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it does --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sound like that.  Do you have any thrift shops where you live?
R:  Yeah, we have like the typical goodwill.
L:  Right, right, right.  Yeah, that's sorta the same type of thing.  Do they have beautiful things in there?
R:  Sometimes.  It just depends what you're looking for.  But sometimes it's like, "Ugh, why would somebody buy that for and ..."
L:  Right, right.
R:  But --
L:  It depends on your taste.  If you happen to be looking for a fancy hat that day then maybe you would buy that, but if you're not -- because, you see, I'm looking for a little miniature colored TV for my daughter's bedroom and I seen it in, um, a place for thirty five dollars, very nice, but when I turned it on it wasn't working, but I think it has something to do with the interior of the store, so I was kinda busy so I didn't get the gentlemen to come over and maybe to help me put it on because I think thirty five dollars for a miniature color TV is a very good deal.
R:  It certainly is.
L:  Yeah.  But, you know, I -- I'm not sure if it's working, but then again I didn't think they would be selling something that's not working, so I was wondering about that too.
R:  Uh, uh, I suppose maybe they don't guarantee that stuff, if it's a thrift shop.
L:  Right, right.  So you were saying that you do refunding, what is that?
R:  Uh, that's like, um, like the -- well, I -- I went to Walmarts today and I got like a [inaudible] scented oil, it's for the air fresh for your house, and you get up to four dollars back when you send in the dated cash register tape and the UPC from the package, and you send that in.  It cost two dollars and forty four cents at Walmart and you can get up to four dollars back on the product and they send you a check for that amount, a month.
L:  Wow, that's pretty good because we don't have a Walmart over here where we are.  That's pretty good.  In other words, it's like a lotta rebates, rebating things?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's very good.  I've seen that before, like, if you buy like, a big box of light bulbs and then it says, "Send in like, a four dollar rebate".
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so that's pretty good.  You -- you -- if you do that quite often you can make maybe a pretty penny on that.
R:  Yes, you certainly can.
L:  Oh, that's pretty good.  That's a good -- I gotta look into that because any way to, um, you know, make money it's good, especially if you're a homemaker or things like that, and you can use the extra money to buy food and clothing for the family.
R:  And there's another thing you can do, um, if you go on the computer, to violation, it's V.O.L.I.T.I.O.N. dot com, you can do mystery shopping.  They got a forum there that you can check in to dot jobs.  Sometimes they got stuff in Manhattan.
L:  Right, right.  It's mystery shopping?
R:  Yeah, it's called mystery shopping and most of the time you can't tell you're in this -- in there doing mystery shopping but that's where you evaluate like, um, the customer service.  That you do like, restaurants, grocery stores, sometimes they want, um, kids stores and since you said you have a daughter, that maybe you can work something around, you know, your daughter.
L:  Right.  Now, this mystery shopping, do you have to go -- you know, you have to go to somewhere to mystery shop for someone?
R:  Um, [SIGH] i- it d- -- it depends on what -- what store, uh, what they have on the job board there, um, as I said, when you -- if -- if you go into V.O.L.I.T.I.O.N. dot com and look under forums you see mystery shopping, they got a list of job postings.  And they'll tell you, you know, what they have available.
L:  Right --
R:  I --
L:  -- right, I see.
R:  And then they have different companies you can apply to and you can, um, um, you know what I mean, they can call you if they -- if they have a, um, job in your area.  And most of the time you do have to do this online, the forum.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So I don't know if you have a computer at home?
L:  Right.  Yeah, my daughter works on it mostly, I'm not too, uh, I don't use it too much.  So then they give you like, a part time thing to do one -- in one day, something like that?
R:  Right.  It just depends on what the jobs call for, you know, 'cause sometimes you can be like, in and out, or sometimes you might just, you know, they did -- it would tell you what they need you to do.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Have you ever tried that before?
R:  Yes, I have.
L:  Did -- did it work out for you okay?
R:  Yes, it has.
L:  Oh.  And you only did it for like, a short period of time, one day or something like that?
R:  Um, it can be like, um, um, uh, it's usually like, for me, less than a day, but like, I got several d- grocery stores that I do, I got several restaurants that I do and -- and it's nice.
L:  Right, right.  So you would go to the place and do -- and shop there or something like that, do it for the -- for the Internet?
R:  Right.  And -- and you get like, at the grocery stores like, if, uh, you go in they might have you evaluate like, three departments and they might have you buy something, you get reimbursed, um, some money.  So that pays you for -- the one shop I do pays fifteen dollars a shop.
L:  Right, right.  That's pretty good, that's pretty good.  I really haven't heard about if they have that in New York but you think they do?
R:  Oh yes, 'cause I've seen it posted for, uh, um, the New York City area.
L:  Right, right.  And it's called Violation?
R:  Right.
L:  Violation dot com?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  I'll -- I'm gonna ask my daughter look into that.  And then it just says, Mystery Shopping?
R:  Right.
L:  Right.  And then they send -- they call you and send you somewhere?
R:  Not n- -- sometimes they might call me but sometimes like, if I go apply for a job I do it over the Internet and they might email me back, sometimes they might call me, it just depends.
L:  Right, right.  That's pretty good.  Uh, that's pretty good.  So that's one of your hobbies?
R:  Yes.  I like doing that too.
L:  Right, right.
L:  Uh, and I had this +one nice [several inaudible words] work that I do every three months, so it's like I get good food there and the service is usually pretty good, so I enjoy that.
R:  Right, right, that's pretty nice.  That -- that sounds wonderful.  Well, in Manhattan basically, you know, there's always something to do, somewhere to go.  I like to go through different things like they ha- -- sometimes they have street fairs which is very interesting, you know, you can grab a lemonade and walk through the street fairs, um, you don't really have to buy anything but everything is interesting and the people are interesting.  And like I said, there's never a dull moment in Manhattan, you just walk through the streets and you see all kind of strange things, and, um, there's always something to do, there really is.  If you get bored and you have a couple of dollars in your pocket, like I said, thrift shopping, you could stay in the church thrift shop for at least an hour or two.
