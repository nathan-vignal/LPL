L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm Karen.
L:  I'm Amy.
R:  Hi.  Where are you?
L:  Well, what are your hobbies?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Where are you at?
L:  Oh, Washington State.
R:  Oh.  I'm in Oregon.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, not too far.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, my hobbies are usually the Internet, spending time on the Internet --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- doing sweepstakes and contests and things like that.
L:  I spent a lotta time on the Internet too, mostly news groups and just email with friends.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Um, do you have any ...?
L:  My biggest one right now is just bargains.  Like I get -- like going to stores, like big lots and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- liquidation places and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- finding really good deals.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's always great.  [MN]  I go to Dollar Tree.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, we just got a new one of those here.
R:  Ah, yeah.  They're a pretty good store.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What other hobbies do you have?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's -- that's about all I do right now.  When I was younger I collected stamps.  So, I still have my stamp collections.  I just haven't spend any time on 'em in years --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, um, tropical fish.
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] It sounds like you have children.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, I have one four year old.
R:  Ah.  That's a hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's keeps you busy.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I've got two kids.  Two girls.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] And they keep me pretty busy too.  [LAUGH]  Um, my -- my hobby is watching them I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- keeping them from killing each other.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm home schooling and my husband is military.  So, oh, yeah, that's takes a lotta time.  I mean ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It would.  Oh, um, gee, what other hobbies do I have?  Um [LIPSMACK], um, I guess [SIGH], um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I collect, uh, collectible things.  I guess that's another hobby I have.  Like, um, little animal miniatures and things and figurines.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, not much else.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  At least not at the moment.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I kinda collect a few things, but it's the type of things that -- people buy me those things.  Like, I like Siamese cats.  It's not something I really pursue on my own though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess that doesn't count [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because it doesn't take up my time.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  Um ...
L:  But then the other part of the question was, do you feel everybody should have at least one hobby?  Or something like that.
R:  Yeah, I think it's good for people to have at least one hobby.
L:  'Cause you've gotta be doing something.  So, depending on your definition of hobby I kinda figure everybody [NOISE] probably does have one.  But ...
R:  Yeah.  Something just to let off steam or, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- out of the ordinary, out of your regular schedule, something to do.  But, yeah, I think everyone should have at least a hobby.  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE]  [MN]
L:  How much time do you spend on your hobbies?
R:  Um, probably -- I don't know -- three or four hours a day on the computer.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I spend at least -- at least two hours a day probably on the computer.  My daughter doesn't like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Don't sit down at the computer".  She knows I won't get up for a while.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  [PAUSE]  [MN]  Yeah, other than that, um, I don't spend much time on any of my other hobbies.
L:  Yeah, the fish I feed them in the morning and when I go to bed.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's about that.
R:  That's pretty easy.  Yeah, we have goldfish, um, that's -- that's what we do too.  We also have a dog and a cat.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  [PAUSE] When I was in high school I could tell ya all the names of all the fish and was really into going to the pet stores and getting new ones and stuff like that.  But right now we've got three and I'm just happy that they've [LAUGH] been here for quite a long time.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.  [MN]
L:  [PAUSE] Shopping I probably -- I don't know -- that wouldn't be something I'd do every day.  So, probably -- I don't know -- five hours a week.
R:  Yeah.  That's sounds about the same for me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  I used to like to read a lot, but that's not something I have time with my daughter.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  Kids kinda take away your hobby time.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, and scrap booking, which I used to do when she still took naps, but [LAUGH] I pretty much haven't since he outgrew naps.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to do puzzles a lot, but now that we've got this puppy I can't do much of anything that he can get into and tear up and -- and chew up and ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  But I guess that's a hobby, cleaning up after him.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Because he's five months old and he chews on everything --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and sheds everything he sees.  [MN]  So ...
L:  We -- we had a rabbit for a while, but we got rid of it when our daughter was born.
R:  Oh.  [COUGH]  Yeah.
L:  That's about the only [inaudible] pet I've had in my adulthood.  I've just had --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just a fish.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, our cat's thirteen years old.  So, we've had him for quite a while and -- and everything [COUGH] and he hates the puppy and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ya can't blame him I guess.  [MN]  [PAUSE]  Um, I guess another hobby is watching T.V.  [LAUGH]  T.V., I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I watch -- I watch Judging Amy on Tuesday nights, but that's the only time I turn on the television, but that one I've gotta see.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [PAUSE]  [MN] Well, um [COUGH], let's see.  I used to do a lotta cooking as a hobby.
L:  [PAUSE] Mm.  I like to bake, but not really ...  [PAUSE] And by the time anything is cooked I've tasted it so much that I'm tired of it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN]  [COUGH]
L:  [PAUSE] So, have you already done a few of these telephone things?
R:  Yeah, a couple.
L:  This is my third.
R:  Mm.  [MN]  Yeah, the last one I did was on, uh, movies, the topic was movies.
L:  Oh, mine was on affirmative action.
R:  Ah.
L:  That was a hard one.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN]  [PAUSE] Yep.
L:  [PAUSE] Do you work?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.
R:  No.  I stay home.
L:  Yeah, me too.  Before -- before I had my daughter I did day care.  So --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- the same thing but with no pay and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- now I teach Sunday school and vacation bible school.  So, I guess kid stuff is kinda like a hobby.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]  [PAUSE] So, how many minutes has it been?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  I keep wondering.  [MN]  [PAUSE]  I shouldn't be much longer now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  I think you're the first -- first person I've had that's been on this coast.  Everybody else has had an accent.
R:  Yeah, the same here.  It's like everybody's been over on the east coast or somewhere over that way, um ...
L:  One in the south and one in New York.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.  The last person I talked to was like seventy four.  [MN]
