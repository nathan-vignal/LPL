R:  Hello.  My name is Margaret.
L:  Hi, I'm Rachel.  [LAUGH] How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.  Um, so hobbies.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I have a lot of hobbies.  [LAUGH]  I col- ...
L:  [LAUGH] Tell me about 'em.
R:  I collect dolls for one thing and ...
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yes, and ...
L:  Do you collect Barbie's?
R:  Yes, I have many Barbie's.
L:  [LAUGH] I do too in the boxes still of course.
R:  Oh, well, no.  I take mine out of the boxes 'cause I like to change their clothes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, uh, so, I -- I do believe that people need hobbies and, um, the more the b- -- the better.
L:  Yes.  It's what makes people interesting I think.
R:  Yeah.  I worry about people who have no outside interests --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- y- you know, the people in -- at work where there's nothing in their cubicles that's personal.  You know what I mean?
L:  And you wonder what they do when they go home or ...?
R:  Yeah.  They just sit there and vegetate I guess.
L:  [LAUGH] I, um [LIPSMACK] -- I like to scrapbook.  It's something I got into, uh, probably a couple of years ago.  But it's -- it's crazy.  I mean, some of these people have just -- just the most beautiful pages --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they'll spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on scrapbooks and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's a little more than I'm willing to spend, but it's kinda fun though.  Every now and then just have something to work on and, you know, when you're stressed from work or whatever and you need to not -- not think about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I know.  I've done scrapbooks as well.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I like them.  So, you do a lotta crafty stuff too?
R:  Well, no, not really.  I -- I write.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's about as creative as I get.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You write like poetry or ...?
R:  I'm trying to write a book.
L:  Really?
R:  A novel.
L:  That's kinda cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, uh -- I come from a family that's very artistic and everything.  My husband has aunts that, you know, wrote poetry and did beautiful, beautiful quilts and painted and ...
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I -- I got the I guess the more artistic side of it and I do enjoy writing, but it's not -- nothing I'd ever wanna [LAUGH] spend too much time doing, even though my friends thought I should get my bachelor -- or my master's in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've not a lotta interest, but ...
R:  Yeah.  My family, um, everybody paints and -- or plays instruments and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm the one outsider who --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- never got anywhere with the piano lessons, et cetera.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you just keep 'em grounded in other ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's kinda cool 'cause then you have something that they -- you know, they don't do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  That's true and they don't get it about the dolls.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  No, it's just too alien for them.
L:  You know what?  Do you, um -- you said you do the Barbie's.  Now, what other ones do you do?  Do you do like any Madam Alexander's or anything like that?
R:  Well, I have, uh, uh, a couple of the Madam Alexander fashion dolls that they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the more recent ones, um, Alex and -- and a couple of her friends.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, these are fifteen and a half inch tall dolls --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they're -- it's sort of part of the wave that started with Jean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in nineteen ninety five and everyone has sort of discovered that size --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of doll.  So, I have ...
L:  And jumps on the bandwagon, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, I have some of those and Robert Tonner, which is one of my favorite artists.  He's done a lot of things, the Taylor Wentworth, and I don't know if you've seen these Anistel[?] and the Bessie McCall's that are being made now.  He -- he is the Betty McCall person.
L:  Okay.  I'd probably know him if I saw him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, I -- I haven't been into it for a while.  Um, my father had a couple that he'd been really good friends with and they were -- they were an older couple and she was probably -- oh, gosh, uh, seventy five to eighty when she passed away --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she had collected these dolls --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- her entire lifetime and so she kinda tried to get me into it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She was like a grandmother type age and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I -- I started getting into a lotta like Barbie's and I have a couple Madam Alexander's that she gave me, like the old Scarlet O'Hara's, but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I haven't really -- I haven't really done 'em too much recently.
R:  Yeah.  Well, there are so many new things coming out that it's -- you have to have a focus [LAUGH] of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what you're going to collect and just let everything else slide by.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I, uh [COUGH] -- I kinda got outta that when I went to college and didn't have the money, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  My financial situation has changed drastically.  So, I have had to cut back.  But there are some things that I can't let, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- get away.
L:  Well, that's -- you know, life is short.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You don't wanna pass up the things that -- the things that make you happy.
R:  Yeah.  That's how I see it.  I mean, I figure we need to play and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, it's boring not to have something -- some kind of a -- well, hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I have a lot ...
L:  Like a release.
R:  Yeah.  I think I have a lot more toys now than I ever did when I was a kid.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and I've heard a lot of people say that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like we always joke with my Dad because he's -- actually he'll be eighty three tomorrow --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- and he grew up in the Depression and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, he didn't really have a lot as a kid and so he loves all his mechanical stuff now and he has old time like banks that have moving parts and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and it's -- it's like he's reverted back to his childhood and he has all his toys that he likes to play with [LAUGH] and we kinda -- you know, we kinda tease him, but it's true.  It's -- you know, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess everything comes full circle and I -- I guess it just keeps you young at heart and keeps life -- life interesting.
R:  Yeah, I think so.  I've -- I've noticed several of these doll, um, artists like Robert Tonner and Jean -- the Jean Maloddem[?] who created Jean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, both of them said something like people -- even grown ups need to play and they are big on encouraging people, "Take the dolls out of the boxes".
L:  [LAUGH] Don't just collect them for money's sake.
R:  Yeah.  There's no real money in it I'm afraid unless you happen to get something like one of those Harley Davidson doll- -- Barbie's.
L:  Are those big?
R:  Well, they were.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The, um -- there were only five of them and the first one is selling for hundreds of dollars.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.  But something like that happens very rarely and I've -- I'm convinced when it says it's a collectible --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's never gonna be worth anything.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not really.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you just -- if you like it fine.
L:  [LAUGH] You'd get a kick out of this one.  My, uh -- my older sister, she's quite a bit older, and as a kid my Mom would take her every week to pick out a new Barbie outfit.
R:  [MN]
L:  She had -- I mean, she had the -- all the original outfits --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and she would go to her babysitter's while she -- my Mom was at work and trade her outfits with one of the girls there who would trade her for little homemade outfits and my Mom found out [LAUGH] and she nearly killed her.  She traded away --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- almost all of like the really collectible outfits.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We realized now and my Mom's like, "Julia-Anne, why did you do that?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, she didn't know.  She was only --
R:  Nobody knew.
L:  -- five and six years old.
R:  Yeah.  No one was thinking that this was going to become some desirable collectible forty years later where you can ...
L:  [LAUGH] And you can't really -- I don't think it's any fun if you look at that way.
R:  Yeah.  It's, um -- it just happens and if you're fortunate enough that you hung on to everything that's great.  But I don't know.  These -- there -- there are these outfits that they're still in the packages and it's -- I would find that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very frustrating that oh, sure, it's perfect, but -- but you can't do anything with it.
L:  And you don't wanna take it out.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's value is com- completely dropped if you take it out of the package --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or even break the surround wrapping, you know?  Um, so, I think it's more fun to have the -- the loose things.
L:  And have for fun, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And it's cheaper too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's kinda how I am with my, um -- my scrapbooks.  I mean, I've spent a lotta money on it, but it's something that I come home and I have -- you know, I work all day and I've got people [MN], you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in one ear and out the other and it's so nice just to come home and not -- nothing's a bother, you know --
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  -- and pull out photographs of -- oh, you know, here's something fun and oh, this is a great trip and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- put it all in there and kinda just leave the real world for a little bit [LAUGH] and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, that's [COUGH] -- the fun of it I enjoy is actually --
