L:  Hi, my name is Linda.
R:  Hi, I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi, Debbie.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  How you doing?
L:  Good.  Good.
R:  [MN]  
L:  Hobbies, huh?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  How 'bout surveys?  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, really.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I like that one.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  That one at least gives me some money back.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I know.  Yeah.  Um, hobbies.  Uh.  I don't really have any hobbies.
R:  You don't have any hobbies?  Oh, boy.
L:  I probably play -- I play around on the computer.  That's probably --
R:  Well, I play on the computer too, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like to antique.  Go antique --
L:  Oh.
R:  And garage sales.  [LAUGH]  I don't know if those are hobbies or not.
L:  Yeah, I think they are.  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Oh, those are nice hobbies.  
R:  Yeah.  I like --
L:  I'm not very talented in that area, though.  As far as antiquing or [LAUGH] +anything.
R:  Well, I don't know whether I'm talented, you know.  But I -- I enjoy it and my daughter's twenty eight so we kind of go every Saturday morning, we go out.
L:  Oh.
R:  And if we can find somebody to watch the new baby.  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's where [several inaudible words] [COUGH], 'scuse me, it really comes in, you know.  Gets kind of catchy there.  We have to get grandpa to babysit her once in a while here.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, you know.  Um, uh, but I do a lot of thi- -- I mean, I used to, I like to needlepoint.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Uh ...
L:  Yeah.  I -- I used to do, um, [LIPSMACK] needlepointing and crocheting and stuff, but I don't do much of that anymore.  
R:  Well --
L:  Um, have a little arthritis in my hands so ...
R:  Oh, yeah, that --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- that would make it a little bit difficult.
L:  Yeah, I kind of gave that up.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I know.  'Cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I can tell [MN] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When I go back to it, you know, my -- my hands get stiff.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah --
R:  But --
L:  -- they do.  Yeah.  Uh, I co- I collect angels.  Um ...
R:  Oh, do ya?
L:  Yeah.  That's probably my only thing is -- my only hobby.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, see I collect ever- --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  I collect everything.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, [MN] really.  How?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I do.  I mean I collect -- I mean, I, you know, like old kitchen utensils, um ...
L:  [MN] 
R:  Old Christmas ornaments.
L:  Oh, my.  Yeah, well a lot of my angels are Christmas, um --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- ornaments and stuff.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm sure they are.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I collect Hummels and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What else do I collect?  Oh, I just have a collection of everything.  I mean, you [LAUGH] know. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I [MN] -- if I find stuff cheap enough, you know, like at garage sales and stuff I just go ahead and pick 'em up.  
L:  Right.
R:  So that's, you know, I don't have a whole lot of money invested in my hobbies, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah.  No, I --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I [MN] -- um, I spend a few hours a day on the computer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, mostly playing around.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, [MN]  Yeah, me too.
L:  I guess -- yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess that's my [LAUGH] -- that's my hobby.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Looking for surveys to fill out and freebies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to do and ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  I do.  Uh, well, I don't do that many surveys but, uh, um, if -- if I see one posted somewhere I'll -- I'll sign up for it.  
R:  [MN]  
L:  Um, I don't qualify for too many anymore.  I think I'm getting too old.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you know, somebody had said that they want more men.
L:  Oh, yeah, well, that makes sense.  They're always -- yeah, um, my husband's always getting emails but he won't do 'em.  
R:  He won't do 'em?
L:  He just doesn't have the time.
R:  Then do it for him.
L:  Yeah, I -- I should.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean I hate to say it, how do they knew who they're talk- -- you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- who're they're getting the information from?
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  I mean, you can think the way he does.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I probably know better how he thinks than he does.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was gonna say that but I thought I'd be nice.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  No.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Uh.
L:  I know.  Yeah, um, oh, hobbies.  Yeah.  That's -- that's it.  Collecting angels and going on the computer.  Um ...
R:  Hm.
L:  Like I said, I don't do a heck of a lot anymore.  I used to gar- -- do a lot of gardening.  
R:  Do you?  [MN]  Well, see --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't -- I never got into that.  Well, I don't know where you are but we're in Florida.  
L:  Oh, well, [MN] uh, when I used to live in New England I u- -- I had --
R:  Oh.  
L:  -- a big garden.
R:  Oh, I bet.  
L:  Um, but now we have, uh, uh -- my backyard's all cement.  I have a pool.
R:  Well, we do too.  But I, you know ...
L:  So I don't do a heck of a lot of gardening.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it's too hot here to do.  I mean, gardening, really.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I don't --
L:  I think -- I think hobbies like antiquing, that -- that sounds wonderful.
R:  [MN]  Well, you know, like my husband and I can go out on a Saturday afternoon and go, like, to the flea market or, you know, if we want to just do something without spending a whole lot of money too.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know.
L:  Right.  I have two sister in laws that are into antiquing.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And -- oh, they have some beautiful pieces of furniture.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, o- one of 'em is -- has a real talent for, um, finding real nice pieces.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And, you know, just knowing what's under there.
R:  Exactly.  Yes.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  But you have to kind of know what you're looking for.  Now my daughter has a good eye too.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  She can kind of spot things better than I can.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know whether --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, that comes --
L:  My daughter's not into anything, any hobbies.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, she does.  She started scrapbooking.
R:  Oh, yes.  My daughter's into that too.  
L:  Oh, she does beautiful --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- beautiful work.  Yeah, she's getting very good at it. 
R:  Is she?  You know, my daughter is too.  She just got into it, like I said, we have a n- -- she has a new baby and she wanted to start pages for him.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's -- and I told her, I said -- she wants me to go to all these scrapbooking things with her and I said, "That's not my thing".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, I will go but I wo- -- you know ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's not something I want to get into.  
L:  No.  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, but I think it's good for her because, you know, the pages are so cute for the baby.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, you know, they're ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, my daughter's not married yet but, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she will be next year.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, good.  That's [inaudible] --
L:  So, yeah -- so she's, um, she's got a couple of [MN] ones started and, uh -- yeah, like I say, once they have a baby that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's -- that's a great time to do scrapbooking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So everytime I see something on, you know, the computer about scrapbooking I send it over to her and, you know, she -- and she does pages and, like I said, I -- that's not my thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's -- you know.  But I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's wonderful for her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause that way -- 'cause I have all my pictures in a box.  You know, a shoebox.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't have 'em in an album and, you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- and I guess --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's the best way to do it.  Is to get 'em and, you know, is -- to scrapbook as an album so --
L:  Yeah. Yeah.
R:  -- that really is ...
L:  Yeah, I have too -- just too many through the years to even -- even --
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Uh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Is your daughter having a big wedding?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, yeah.  She is.
R:  Is she?
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  But not 'til next -- next May.
R:  Yeah, but still it takes you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a year to plan.  
L:  Yeah.  Oh, it does.  It does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So far she's, um, she's got the, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, uh, church reserved and the, uh, reception, uh, place reserved.  
R:  Yeah, well that's the two biggies there.
L:  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  They just started, um ...
R:  Yeah, and the next is the gown.
L:  She -- oh, she's got that.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  She got that.  She got a real -- she found one on sale --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so she just has to go back next year for the fittings.
R:  Yeah.  That's [MN] --
L:  [MN]  Hello?
R:  Yeah, I'm still here.  
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That was my call waiting.
L:  I thought we were just --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  +Thought we were disconnected.
R:  That's why my daughter and I did.  We just went out and it was s- so funny.  It was -- the first dress she tried on was it.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I said, you know, "Let's look around, you know, a little bit more".  And we did and she came back to that one and I couldn't believe it.  It was the very first one.  And it was on sale too.  And it was so cheap.
L:  Oh.
R:  But it was beautiful.  And it was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- exactly what she wanted.  I couldn't believe.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  That --
L:  Uh, yeah, my dau- dau- daughter tried hers on, uh, [MN] last weekend.  Um, and it do- -- it looks beautiful.  She doesn't need to have it, um, altered too much.  
R:  Good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It'll be nice.
R:  Good, because that's where they really [LAUGH] get you, is the alterations.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I -- I think it was included -- oh, I don't know.
R:  I --
L:  I -- I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Usually it's not but if you did that's a good, you know, that's a good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's what --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they always try to do is, you know, say is, six sizes too big so they have to alter it.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  No, she got the right size.  So [MN] -- she had to wait for six weeks.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  
L:  But, uh, we weren't in any hurry.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  But if -- it's better to get everything done ahead of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know to really start looking ahead of time 'cause I guess she -- my daughter started, like, a year ahead of time too.  
L:  Good, yeah.
R:  And she got her gown and, like I said, and [MN] -- I was going to make her a veil but we went back and there was a veil that had -- like somebody had tried it on and ripped a hole in the bottom of it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So she didn't want a long one anyway, you know.  So we just had our seamstress take and cut it off and turn, you know, hem it up.
L:  Wow.
R:  And it was perfect.  I mean, it [COUGH] very reasonable.
L:  Great.
R:  Very [LAUGH] reasonable.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, you know, it just kept -- it was real funny.  Everything we tried to do we just kind a went -- everything we went to do it -- it was on sale.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- not that [MN] --
L:  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um --
R:  You know, we tried to get it on sale but it wasn't like, you know, we -- she didn't get what she wanted.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She got exactly what she wanted and everything we went to do was on sale, so ...
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So that was --
L:  Oh, well, anyway I guess we're supposed to talk [LAUGH] about -- about, uh, hobbies.  What was the last thing we were supposed to talk about?  Oh, [SIGH] --
R:  Hobbies or ...?
L:  How -- how long we spend on 'em.  And, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I forget the last thing.
R:  And why -- and if you think everybody should have one.
L:  Oh, I do.
R:  And I --
L:  I think everybody --
R:  I do too
L:  -- should have a hobby.  Yes.
R:  Because, well, I used to needlepoint.  It really relaxed me.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I just, you know, I think everybody needs to get away and do their own little thing.
L:  Right.  Well, I think -- I think the internet is my -- my outlet.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, 'cause you -- you can kind a, I hate to say it, go in there and be all by yourself.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And do your own thing.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Without anybody bothering you.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So I like that.  I like the message boards.
R:  Yeah, I do too.  I read it --
L:  Probably my hobby.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I read a few of those.  Not very many, but ...  
L:  Yeah, I do more -- more looking than I do, um, joining in but, uh ...
R:  Yeah, I do
