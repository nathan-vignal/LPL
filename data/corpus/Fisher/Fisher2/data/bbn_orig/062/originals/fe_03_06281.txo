R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Meagan.
L:  I'm -- my name is Jen.
R:  Hi, Jen.  [LIPSMACK] So, we're supposed to talk about hobbies?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Hobbies and how much time we spend on them and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- everything.
R:  Great.  Um, well, tell me about some of your hobbies.
L:  I love to read.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I love to write.
R:  Me too.
L:  Um -- do you?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.  I like to -- I like to go biking and I would love to go hiking and stuff like that, but I have three small children and it makes it very difficult.
R:  Oh, yes.  You can't really have them along on the hiking trips yet.
L:  No, no.
R:  Okay.
L:  No, they make it very difficult.
R:  Mm.
L:  But --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- I love lots of outdoor stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Well, I also like to read a lot.  I, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I listen to music and play music and I go see shows and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- let me think what else.  I swim a lot.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  That's my favorite sport.  I love to swim.  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  And, uh, I love to spend time with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're enor- enormously important to me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I hear one of your small ones now.
L:  Yes.
R:  Are you making dinner?
L:  No, no.  I was just putting them to bed actually.
R:  Oh, hm.
L:  No.  Um ...
R:  Oh, we have to talk about time.  Time.
L:  And how much time we spend on each of them and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if we think that they're important for people to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that hobbies are extremely important for people to pursue.
R:  So do I.  I -- I feel that it's important for every person to have something that -- that's solely for them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they can -- they have an outlet that they can focus their energy on and have --
L:  Right.  And ...
R:  -- time set aside, whether it's alone time or just personal time to pursue.
L:  Most people spend all their time -- a lotta the time working and it's not --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- always -- sometimes it something that they like to do.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  So, yes, we definitely need to have something for them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for us.
R:  [LAUGH] How -- do you -- do you bike every day?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  No, but I love to mountain bike.  I've got a -- a big trailer behind my bike --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I have two small ones that can't keep up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I've got a five year old, a two and a half year old, and a five and a half month old.
R:  That's great.  Is it one of those wagon type things with a flag?
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah.
L:  A bike trailer with a flag on the back.
R:  Yeah.  That's fantastic.
L:  And so where do you live?
R:  I live, uh, in Portland, Oregon.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And where are you?
L:  I'm up in, um, Raymond, Alberta, Canada.  [NOISE]
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  That's kind of interesting.
R:  It's much colder there.  Hey, are you still getting rain and snow up there?
L:  Um, well [LAUGH], we did actually.  This weekend was just nasty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, no, right now it's -- it's -- it's warm.  Oh, I don't know what it was today.  I think it was [LIPSMACK] about eighteen degrees, uh, Celsius.
R:  Celsius, yes.  [LAUGH]  Okay.
L:  And I'm not sure what that is Fahrenheit.
R:  I don't remember what the conversion is.  It is two point two degrees?  It's something like that.
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Whatever.  It's like [LIPSMACK] just under seventy I would think.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, it's -- it's probably around seventy five here now too.
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It changes from being, uh -- from raining to being very humid to being very sunny all within, you know, half an hour.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's basically what it's like here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  One [NOISE] -- one minute it can be freezing, the next minute you can be in your shorts.
R:  Yeah.  That's why you should always bring layers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The layers are very important.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]  Especially when camping or hiking or biking --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- or swimming.  So ...
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  I don't know about swimming, but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You only have one layer on for swimming I would think.
R:  Unless you're swimming in very cold water.
L:  Yes, that's right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You need wet suits.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, do you go swimming out in a lake or do --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- you do indoor?
R:  Well, I do indoor and outdoor and, uh, I -- I like to swim in lakes and not so much in the ocean 'cause it's the Pacific Ocean.  So, it's very, very cold.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Um, but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I -- I swim mostly every day and I swim for fun as well as for health.  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.  That's the only way you're gonna keep going.
R:  I agree.  You have to find a [LAUGH] -- you have to find that -- that quick -- that sport that makes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you fit that you still have an interest in doing.  I also like, uh [LIPSMACK], belly dancing quite a lot.
L:  Oh, I've been wanting to get into that.
R:  It's great.  It's -- it's --
L:  I think that would be fascinating.
R:  -- it's so much more of a workout than you think.
L:  Oh, I ...
R:  You think oh, I'm just gonna be dancing, right, right?  [LAUGH]  And I put on my skirt and I shake around, but no.
L:  Oh, it's just a little hip shake --
R:  Right.
L:  -- how hard can it be?  [LAUGH]
R:  It's such a workout.  I don't -- I don't know if I've ever b- -- I have sweated as much as when belly dancing.  It's true.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Did you take classes?  Do you have classes there or ...?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  There's --
L:  And it -- is it ...?
R:  -- studios.  There are troupes, like dance troupes and they have their --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- their studios that they set up and then various members will teach classes.  But it's -- it's very cooperative, you know, everyone just sort of -- they -- everyone dances together and then you get instruction [COUGH] for the beginning and then there's dancing.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Is that clear?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  So, do you dance with -- in a troupe or do you take less- ...?
R:  Oh, no, no.  I'm nowhere near that level [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at all.
L:  Uh, how long have you been doing that for?
R:  Uh, not so long.  I've been doing it for [MN] about a year now I'd say.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  The dancing, the belly dancing.  But, um ...
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been into yoga.
R:  I like yoga too.
L:  I think it's wonderful.
R:  It's very relaxing.
L:  It is surprisingly.  I can't believe how much of a workout it is.
R:  I know.  There's that too.  You -- what -- what kind of yoga are you doing?
L:  Um, I think it's Hafa[?] yoga.
R:  Yeah.  That's the kind I do too.
L:  It's the most calmer I believe.
R:  Only for relaxing for me though, not so much as the fast paced, um, really athletic --
L:  Aerobic.
R:  -- energetic stuff.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't do very much of that.
L:  No, I don't like that.  That's too much like aerobics.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's too much like work.  [LAUGH]  No, I like -- I like the -- I like the more meditative --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- deep breathing, relaxing kind.  It just makes you feel -- when you're done you feel relaxed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.  That's the one.
R:  I like that too.  Ah.
L:  Yes.  Well, that's kind of ...
R:  So, you mentioned that you, um, read a lot.
L:  Yes.
R:  What sort of stuff do you like to read?
L:  I read just about everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I've read almost all of like Louie La More, Stephen King, Dean Kootz.
R:  Got ya.
L:  Um, a wide variety.  I -- I've read the, uh -- even the, uh -- oh, what's it called? -- the books by Tim La Hay and Jerry Jenkins.
R:  No, I don't know those.
L:  Um, they're called the Left Behind series.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's -- it's actually kind of a Christian theme.  So, it's actually completely different than what I usually read --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I just -- I read just about anything I can get my hands on.  I've read some of the Oprah Book Club books and [LIPSMACK], um ...
R:  You might like, um -- I -- there's a trilogy called The Golden Mean or something like that, The Golden Mean trilogy, and it's billed as children's books.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's by this guy Phillip Pullman.  But it's -- it's very -- they're interesting.
L:  Phillip Pullman?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if I would recommend them for children as young as yours --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, um [NOISE], you would enjoy them perhaps.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  I think it's The Golden Mean trilogy.
L:  M.E.I.N.?
R:  M.E.A.N.
L:  Really?  I like some fantasy and stuff too.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  That's -- that's sort of what it is.  It's -- well, it's fantasy, it's myth, it's, uh [LIPSMACK] -- there's some religious overtones as well, which is why I thought of it when you mentioned --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the other -- the other books.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  It's ...
L:  Interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I've read the Robert and Jordan series.
