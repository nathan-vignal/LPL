L:  Okay.  Do you have any hobbies?
R:  Um, actually, uh, I would like to read, uh, books in --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- my spare time.  
L:  Who's your favorite author?
R:  Um, I -- I don't have -- I don't think I have +special authors.
L:  Yeah.  Do you read like suspense or romance or mystery or what kind?
R:  Sometimes like romance, sometimes mysteries.
L:  Do you read, like, Jude Duval[?] and Sandra Brown?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Have you ever read anything by Sandra Brown?
R:  Um, no.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I see.  Who else?  I read her.  She's really good.
R:  You like --
L:  I love to read too.
R:  Okay.  That's about a romantic story or ...?
L:  Yeah, she writes real -- it's kind of like comedy romance.  Her name's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Sandra -- Sandra Brown.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then, um, Jane Anne Krentz[?].  Have you ever read anything by her?
R:  No.  
L:  Oh, she is great.
R:  +Okay.
L:  She's real popular too.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And Jude De- Deverell[?].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those are the three I read.
R:  Okay. 
L:  They kind -- they're kind of re- -- it's like romance but it's comedy and [MN] sometimes it's got like a little bit of suspense to it too.
R:  Mhm.  And I think, uh, I like watch- watching movies.
L:  Do you?  I don't -- I don't care for television or movies much so I don't do that.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  'Cause [MN] -- 
L:  I do a lot of couponing too.  I collect coupons and rebates and --
R:  Oh, that's interesting.  I try, uh, I try some but I'm not very good at that.
L:  Oh, it's so easy to get into.  Stick with it.  
R:  Uh, I know that, uh, once I got a lot of stuff from Office Max.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, they gone -- they let me fill in a lot of rebate forms?
L:  Yep.
R:  And, uh, my friends told me sometimes they don't really, uh, mail your rebate back so you have to call them.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH]  But that just [MN], like, killing your time.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, with Office Remax they are really, really bad about trying to mess up your rebates so ...
R:  Really?
L:  You know, they'll purposely send you cards saying you sent the wrong --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- thing in.  Then you have to call 'em and --
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  But stick with it 'cause it -- [MN] it's your money and you do -- and that -- and you deserve to get it, plus they count on people giving up so they get to keep the money.
R:  Yeah, uh, just that, uh, they finally will give you back but they just kept you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- busy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I know I --
R:  Yeah, but I -- 
L:  -- did the same thing.
R:  -- I was [inaudible] the final exam and, uh, well, I send my rebate forms.  They haven't reached me back and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was, okay, I need to call them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they kept you waiting and they kept you [LAUGH] waiting.
L:  Did you ever get your money?
R:  Yeah.  I got --
L:  Good.
R:  I -- I think I got a fifty percent [MN] back from Office Max.  But --
L:  'Cause I'm having a battle with them right now myself.  I bought some stuff over on the computer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Over -- over net -- o- over the internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And got everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then sent in all the rebates --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then just yesterday I got three different postcards from them saying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this is wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  
L:  And I know it's right because I bought the thing that they was advertised as having the rebate to go with it.
R:  Yeah, and a, uh, you know, sometimes they -- they gonna [MN] mail you two different forms of rebate.  One is to the -- to the, like, Office Max.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The others --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- direct you to the factory. 
L:  Yeah.  And they both --
R:  And then [MN] --
L:  -- want the original barcode.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah and I lost, uh, the factory's contact number.  So [MN] --
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know how to find the number but Office Max just tell you, "Okay, check your rebate book".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Right.  That's long gone.
R:  I already lost it.  
L:  Yep.  I have pretty good luck with Walgreens.  Do you have a Walgreens in your town?
R:  No.  'Cause [MN] --
L:  See they have a rebate program too every month.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's -- it's small things like --
R:  [MN]  What kind of --
L:  -- a tube of toothpaste.
R:  Uh, what kind of products they sell?
L:  They're -- they're like a drugstore.
R:  Okay.  
L:  So they sell, like, toothpaste and cosmetics and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- aspirins and stuff like that.  
R:  Oh, sounds good.
L:  And they do pretty good.  I -- I get --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- their stuff every month.  It's totally free after rebate.  You send it in and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then I -- they do really good about giving my money to me.
R:  Oh.  How to spell the name?
L:  It's W.A.L.
R:  W.A.L.
L:  Uh-huh.  G.R.
R:  G.R.
L:  Uh-huh.  E.E.N.
R:  E.E.N.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Walgreen.
L:  Right.  Walgreen.
R:  Okay.
L:  Look to --
R:  I --
L:  -- see if you have one of those anywhere close by.
R:  Okay.  Do they sell, like, uh, the Centrum -- Centrum complex +vitamin?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they do.
R:  Oh, that's good.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's stuff [MN] -- those vitamins are expensive.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  But sometimes you can get a coupon for them.  
R:  I got coupons.  They +actually from the Walgreen?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  They, uh -- they send it to -- to your, um, home address or ...?
L:  What, the coupons?
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you go on the internet and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and look [MN] -- type in the name of, uh, Centrum [MN] vitamins.
R:  Okay.
L:  And sometimes if you can go there and they'll send you coupons.  
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  So try that and then you can to Walgreens and get 'em really -- pretty cheap there.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, sounds great.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And I like shopping.
L:  You like shopping?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now see you think I would since I do all this couponing and stuff but I don't really --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like to [LAUGH] shop.  It's terrible.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I save all these coupons right.  Ask people to give me coupons and things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I usually wind up going to Aldies[?] which is a store we have here in Columbia that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, doesn't sell any kind of name brands but they sell like --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- really cheap stuff.
R:  Okay.
L:  So that's usually what I wind up using anyway.
R:  Uh-huh.  I guess maybe I'm not where, uh, -- I'm not good at organized those coupons.  [LAUGH]  Sometimes I got a lot of coupons but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I went to the -- like, to the supermarket --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I [several inaudible words] "Those coupons have expired".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  You need to sit down before you go --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and throw away all the expired ones.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  And then you get your -- you can go to, like, uh, the dollar store --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or Walmarts and get you a coupon --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- organizer.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And start out with that.  That's what I used for a long time, is one of those l- little things that looks like an accordion file. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But now I have a zip up binder that I use and I --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- keep baseball cardholders in it.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I put my coupons in those plastic sleeves.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Like the baseball card sleeves.
R:  Mhm.  'Cause --
L:  That works really well for me now.
R:  Oh, okay.  'Cause for me, uh, I'm a student.  I'm a doctor student. 
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  I just -- the study kee- keeps me busy so I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really have much time to find a coupon and [LAUGH] to organize though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I -- you sort of forget about [MN] [LAUGH] coupons.
L:  See -- do you have any friends that would might -- if you give them the coupons would organize them for you and maybe you could do something in exchange for them?
R:  Well, I don't think so.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No?  That's a shame.
R:  [MN]
L:  'Cause I bet --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you are busy, being a doctor student.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause most of my friends are my classmates actually.  They are all busy.  
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  Are you a student or ...?
L:  No.  No.  I'm a mother.  I have four boys.  
R:  Wow, that's crazy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.  And then we do foster care too.  So we --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- usually have a couple of other boys around here too.
R:  Okay.  Mhm.  That's great.  
L:  So that's why I do a lot of couponing.  [LAUGH]  'Cause I have to.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Try to save money with all these boys.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've got right now out of my six boys, I have four of them that are teenagers.  
R:  Oh.  You have six boys in total?
L:  Well, I have four of my own and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- two foster boys.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  So we have six boys, four of them are teenagers.
R:  Wow.
L:  Two of 'em are like six foot tall and weigh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- two hundred pounds.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They eat a loaf of bread a day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A box of cereal a day.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They drink a gallon and a half milk a day.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  
L:  It's amazing how much food they can go through.
R:  [MN]
L:  Like I have to go to the store every other day trying to find something to fill 'em up again.
R:  [LAUGH]  Wow, you have a lot to do for those boys.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, but I like 'em.  I like having [MN] a lot of kids around.  The excitement and stuff.  Do you have any kids of your own?
R:  No.  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm only twenty four.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  I haven't gotten married.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, you got plenty of time then.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So what --
R:  But I -- I would hope that, uh, once I got married --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I would hope I can have one boy and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a one -- uh, one girl.
L:  Yeah --
R:  But [MN] --
L:  -- that's what I wanted too.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's just idea.
L:  Yeah.  That's what I wanted.  Now I have four boys.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  But you --
L:  Kept trying for the girl.
R:  You can never control for tha- that.
L:  Huh?
R:  It's out of [MN] -- it's totally out of control.
L:  Yes, it is.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Definitely out of my control.  So what kind of doctor are you going to be once you get your degree?
R:  Um, I guess I would like to go for a faculty?
L:  For what?
R:  Um, go for a faculty.  To be a professor.
L:  Oh.  Okay, that kind of doctor.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, that wouldn't be so bad.  I was thinking, like, medical doctor.  Where you have to stay up twenty four hours a day working at the --
R:  No.  No.
L:  -- nursing room and things.
R:  I'm doing the business doctor degree.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, uh, uh, if I can do well I can join a research school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if I cannot do [LAUGH] well I can probably only go to a teaching school.  They just kept you busy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of students.  But for research is that you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- study your own projects.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And talk to the persons that -- who have the same interest with you.  And that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's make me excited.  
L:  Yeah.  That would be pretty cool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Plus you could also -- you get to sell your ideals to companies that have grant money too to get them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to give you money.  
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Only depends on what kind of project -- what kind of ideas you have.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, that would be pretty good.  
R:  Mhm.  So what else you do in your spare time?
L:  That's about it.  Between reading --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and doing cou-
