L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Tiffany.  Hello?
L:  Oh, hi, I'm Sarah.
R:  Hi, Sarah, nice -- nice to hear you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm pretty good.
R:  Good.  What is, uh -- so what do you do for hobbies?
L:  Well, one of my hobbies is playing tennis.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which I do about three hours a week if I can afford the time.
R:  Are you good?
L:  Um, I used to play in high school and I was really --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- good then but I stopped for like, a year and a half, so I'm just starting back up, so I'm getting there.
R:  Right.
L:  What about you?
R:  Uh, is that your only hobby?  That can't be your only hobby?
L:  Um, well I read but ...
R:  Well that's a good hobby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you -- have you read anything good lately?
L:  Well, lately I've just been reading books for school, so [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, where are you --
L:  Textbooks.
R:  -- going to school?
L:  UCLA.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Burbank.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We're very close by.  What are you studying?
L:  I'm studying astrophysics.
R:  Oh my God!  Wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you in your -- what year are you in?
L:  I'm a first year.
R:  First year.  So you don't have very much time for hobbies do you? [LAUGH]
L:  No, not really. [LAUGH]
R:  You're almost done though, right?
L:  No.
R:  With your first year?
L:  Oh, with my first year, yes.
R:  When do you guys finish?
L:  June twelfth.
R:  Oh, so finals are coming up.
L:  Yeah, unfortunately. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my God.  How did you -- how did you -- now I'm getting off topic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How did you, um, get interested in astrophysics?
L:  Well, it started with my a- -- my hobby, actually, reading.  I read a lot of science fiction and I decided that I liked it, not really, I mean, of course I don't wanna pursue science fiction type things in my career --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but things related to science, so ...
R:  Oh, so -- so do you find it still interesting now that you've done a year of it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you?  Good.  Wow.  That's -- how interesting.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I, uh, I've been out of college for probably -- what's[?] ninety three -- ten years, so, um, I have -- it's probably a few more hobbies.  I remember being in college and not having any hobbies 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you don't have any time.  Um, [LIPSMACK] but I still don't do as many as I should.  I think my biggest hobby is, um, sadly, surfing the Internet.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Shopping on the Internet, mostly shopping on the Internet.
L:  I do that too. [LAUGH]
R:  Um -- do you?  Yeah.  I would like to say that I, um -- these are the things I'm interested in that I would like to call hobbies.  Uh, playing guitar.  I have a guitar and I've always wanted to p- be able to play it but it just sits there collecting dust.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, oil painting.  I have sort of an easel and oil paints and I -- I'll pick it up every now and then and sort of dabble but I don't do it enough to where I feel like I can call it a hobby, you know?
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  Do you feel like you should have more hobbies than you have?
L:  Um, well I don't know, I mean, I've tried a lotta things, like I played the bass guitar for a little bit, but only --
R:  Oh did you?
L:  Only a little bit, it was only during summer.
R:  Did you like it?
L:  Yeah, it was okay.  Um, I only played really simple songs, so that was kinda fun but I wasn't really into it enough to just try anything harder or to get any better, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just kinda one of those [inaudible] things.
R:  Yeah, it takes a lotta practice, right.
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  What, um, what would you do if -- if you could -- if you could have -- you could take any other hobby that you would do, what would it be?
L:  Hm.  I think it would be learning some kind of dancing form.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, have you --
L:  Because --
R:  Have you ever done that before?
L:  No I haven't.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, I mean, when I was a kid we went country dancing, like, me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it was just, um, kind of really informal class -- classes, so it wasn't anything too formal.  But it was still fun.
R:  Well, was it like -- it was like line dancing, like country and western?
L:  Yeah.  A little --
R:  Oh, fun!
L:  -- line dancing and [inaudible] dancing.
R:  Oh, that's fun.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  What about at UCLA?  Don't they offer, um, like, dancing classes you could take as a -- an elective?
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  Oh.
L:  They o- -- they offer 'em for credit and then also just ones outside of -- outside of credit, so --
R:  Have you thought about taking any for ...?
L:  I have thought about it, it's just the time factor really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so --
R:  Yeah, I know.  You're not trying to graduate in three years or anything crazy are you?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's insane.  Oh, I also, um, I just remembered, I learned how to scuba dive.
L:  Really?
R:  I guess that that would be considered a hobby, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My -- my fiance, um, did it for NASA, they do like, the -- it's to pretend -- to simulate [NOISE] weightlessness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They do like, missions underwater in these giant pools --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to simulate like what it would be like to be, you know, out in space, weightless.  [NOISE] And so he was sort of a diver for them, you know, like a standby diver, so he did it a lot.  And then when I met him he was like, you know, you've gotta get certified so when we have our honeymoon we can go scuba diving, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I got certified scuba diving.  It's really fun.  It's a little -- it makes me a little panicky 'cause I'm not very good underwater, but [LAUGH] I think if the water is beautiful and clear I'd be fine.
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  But I sorta did my certification dive in this, um, it's an old q- rock quarry that had filled up with water and so it was just total murk and mud and no fish, so it was sorta like being claus- just very claustrophobic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for me, so ...  But I would like to, um, in the open ocean with really beautiful colorful fish I think it would be so fun.  Have you ever wanted to scuba dive?
L:  Um, I'm actually a little afraid of the ocean water, huh.
R:  Really?
L:  It's -- it's because of the fact that you can't see really well.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  Like, if it was perfectly clear --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then I think I'd be okay with it, but ...
R:  Right.  So you feel sorta similarly to I -- that I do.  Like, swimming pool clear would be fine. [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Yeah, well, I don't know, I can't really -- it's like -- it's kind of a phobia actually.  I have a really, really hard time just stepping in it, so ...
R:  Really?  I've never seen that at all.  Did you grow up in California?
L:  Yeah I did, but it was in the Valley, so ...
R:  Oh, where in the Valley?
L:  Sacramento.
R:  How funny.  So you -- so you didn't spend any time at the ocean at all growing up?
L:  Well, I did when I was growing up.  I don't know, it was just -- it's only been about the past four years.
R:  Really?  That --
L:  Before that we used to go to the ocean all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't know.  But --
R:  That's so interesting.  Did -- have you ever wanted to like, learn how to get over it or just -- you avoid the ocean at all costs?
L:  No, I do go there every now and then and I kind of wait around and --
R:  But you would never like, go in and body surf or anything?
L:  No! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh my God, so interesting.  That's funny, my mom has that too, she has a fear of the ocean, but I think she's more afraid of being -- she had childhood dreams of like, being sucked out to sea by the undertow. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really?  Oh, no, that's not my fear. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, are you afraid of drowning?  Do you have like --
L:  No.
R:  -- the same thing with pools or anything?
L:  No, it's not drowning, it's just there's other live things in the water that I can't see and just that kinda freaks me out.
R:  Oh.  Have you ever been stung by a jellyfish or anything like that?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
R:  So you don't know where this fear comes from?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  And did it just come out of the blue or have you always thought that way?
L:  It kinda just came out of the blue.
R:  That's so --
L:  Like --
R:  -- interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My God, I find that so interesting.  I feel like I'm motivated now to go do a hobby! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm feeling a little guilty.  What else did it say we have to talk about?  What, um, [LIPSMACK] if we think that -- that people should have at least one hobby.
L:  Oh, right, yeah, of course I think people should have at least one hobby.
R:  Why?
L:  Well, I mean, everybody should have something that they're interested in that they should pursue for fun.  I mean, you can only just do things --
R:  Work.
L:  -- that you have to do anyway, yeah, work.
R:  Right.  All work and no play.  Right.  Yeah, I would -- I would agree, I think everybody should [COUGH] have at least one thing that they do for their spirit and for their mental health.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  I think it's easy.  I could definitely do my job full time all day without stopping, so I have to actually make myself stop and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, do something fun.  Lately it's been si- -- oh no, I started a new hobby!  I have to -- I didn't even realize it's a hobby.  I, um, I have a rooftop patio [LIPSMACK] and I decided that it was really bare, so I got a bunch of plants --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- not realizing that they actually take some work. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So -- so my new hobby has been watering the plants, clipping their leaves off, you know, taking care of the roses.  And I didn't realize that roses take a lot of work.  Have you ever -- did you family ever have any rose bushes or anything?
L:  Yeah, we did for a little bit but they were the kind where you don't really have to watch them.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  I -- I -- you know what?  I thought too, you just plant them and water them and they grow.  And then they were looking like, really dead and I walked up close and I thought, "What is wrong with these?" and I looked underneath and they had -- were covered with aphids, the little tiny green bugs that eat their leaves.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I went to the store and I had to get aphid spray.  And then I sprayed them with aphids.  And then the next week they were like, turning white!  And I thought, "What the hell's happening to them now?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I looked closer and I had to research online, you know, what is going on with my roses, and it turns out roses are susceptible to fungus, which is like, this white fuzzy stuff that grows on them.
L:  I have never seen that.
R:  So I had to go to the store a- and buy this fungus spray. [LAUGH]  Like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Jesus, these roses are hard to keep alive!  So I guess that counts as a hobby now.  I've -- my poor fiance, I told him, you know, it looks like we have to water our plants once a day. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like having kids! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A little less complicated than having kids.  [SIGH] So --
L:  Um --
R:  So, are you moving home after, um, you're done?  Do you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- go back to Sacramento or ...?
L:  Yeah.  It's actually a small town right outside of Sacramento, so ... yeah, I'm gonna go back for the summer and I'll go to a GCE or something.
