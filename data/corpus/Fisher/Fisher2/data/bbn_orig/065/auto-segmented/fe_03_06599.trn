IT'S JUST YOU KNOW EVERY PARENT HAS THEIR DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THINGS AND  (fe_03_06599-A-0093)
IT'S I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE LEFT UP TO THE VOTERS ANYWAY I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE LEFT UP TO  (fe_03_06599-A-0094)
YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID THE SENATORS THE CONGRESSMAN MAYOR'S OR WHOEVER MAKES THE DECISIONS HIGHER UP  (fe_03_06599-A-0095)
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO CITIZEN VOTE  (fe_03_06599-A-0096)

I GUESS IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS  (fe_03_06599-B-0072)

I THINK THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE QUESTIONABLE DEPENDING ON WHO WAS READING IT AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR FRAME OF MIND OR WHATEVER IT IS WHEN THEY'RE READING IT  (fe_03_06599-B-0074)
CAUSE LIKE I SAID WE DIDN'T GET TO THAT UNTIL LIKE MAYBE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH GRADE  (fe_03_06599-B-0075)
