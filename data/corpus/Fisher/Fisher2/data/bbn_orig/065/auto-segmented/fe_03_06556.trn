AS A NON DRUG USER UM IT'S NOT AN INVASION OF MY PRIVACY AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE ANY POSITION  (fe_03_06556-B-0007)

IF YOU HAD ONE BAD DRUG TEST TH- THEY THEY GAVE YOU OPPORTUNITY TO TO GO INTO COUNSELLING AND NUMEROUS OTHER THINGS BUT I I BELIEVE ANY COMPANY HAS A RIGHT TO SET  (fe_03_06556-B-0010)

AND THEN ALSO IT'S A KNOWN FACT THAT MANY DRUG USERS ARE NOT I DON'T SAY ALL OF THEM I SUPPOSE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT USE IT RECREATIONALLY  (fe_03_06556-B-0020)
BUT I I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THAT LONG TERM SO I'M I'M KINDA ANTI DRUG BUT AS LONG AS IT'S ILLEGAL  (fe_03_06556-B-0021)
IT'S THE SAME AS SAYING WELL YOU CAN'T STEAL ON OUR PREMISES OR YOU CAN'T BREAK ANY LAW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06556-B-0022)
SO I I DON'T I TO ME ONLY  (fe_03_06556-B-0023)

AND UM IT CAME OUT LATER  (fe_03_06556-B-0035)
I THINK HE HAD A SMALL AMOUNT OF MARIJUANA AND THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE BU- [SIGH] THIS SCHOOL BUS ACCIDENT BUT IT YOU KNOW AS A PA- IF YOU WERE A PARENT OF A SCHOOL AGE CHILD  (fe_03_06556-B-0036)

DRUG TESTING FOR THAT REASON THAT [SIGH] YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANYTHING REALLY EVEN  (fe_03_06556-B-0038)
MAYBE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION THAT MADE THEM DROWSY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO I JUST THINK AN EMPLOYER HAS A RIGHT TO CALL THE SHOTS AND THEY THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WHEN YOU  (fe_03_06556-B-0039)
WORK ON THESE PREMISES YOU HAVE TO OBEY ALL THE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AS WELL AS OUR REQUIREMENTS  (fe_03_06556-B-0040)

I MEAN WHEN YOU SEE THE NUMBER OF ALCOHOL RELATED DEATHS YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE FOR OR AGAINST ALCOHOL I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYBODY SAYING WELL I'M FOR DRIVING DRUNK BECAUSE THAT'S PUTTING THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE TOO [LAUGHTER] [SIGH] UH DO YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN  (fe_03_06556-B-0046)

TO UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN RECREATIONAL DRUGS THAT THEY THINK DON'T AFFECT THEIR JOB PERFORMANCE  (fe_03_06556-B-0060)
THEY HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THAT'S THE STANDARDS IF IF IN OTHER WORDS I THINK WE OUGHT TO THROW AS MANY ROAD BLOCKS AS WE CAN AT 'EM TO MAKE 'EM THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_06556-B-0061)
AND IT'S IT'S PRETTY COMMON AMONG [SIGH] SAY THE THE LATE TEENS AND EARLY TWENTIES AND THEY THEY DON'T FORESEE ON DOWN THE ROAD  (fe_03_06556-B-0062)

THE CHANCES ARE PRETTY GOOD IF THEY START THAT YOUNG  (fe_03_06556-B-0065)
SO YOU KNOW IT MIGHT HELP NIP SOME OF THOSE IN THE BUD IF THE EMPLOYER WENT TO THEM AND SAID LOOK YOU KNOW [SIGH] YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ANOTHER DRUG TESTING AND YOU JUST CAN'T WORK HERE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS SO UM  (fe_03_06556-B-0066)
MAY- MAYBE MORE AND MORE COMPANIES I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF COMPANIES NOW HAVE THAT 'CAUSE I'M NOT OUT THERE IN THE  (fe_03_06556-B-0067)
[SIGH] WORKFORCE BUT I WO- I WOULD SAY A FAIR NUMBER AND MOST OF 'EM TELL YOU ON THE FRONT END I'VE SEEN ADS IN THE PAPER THAT SAY MANDATORY DRUG TESTING  (fe_03_06556-B-0068)
