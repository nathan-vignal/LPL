HI  (fe_03_06597-A-0001)
UM MY NAME IS ALEXANDRIA AND I'M FROM THE BOSTON AREA  (fe_03_06597-A-0002)
OH HI  (fe_03_06597-A-0003)
OKAY  (fe_03_06597-A-0004)
WELL  (fe_03_06597-A-0005)
IDEALLY I WOULD PREFER IF STUFF WAS NOT CENSORED AT ALL BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR SOME PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO CENSOR BOOKS EVEN THOUGH I DON'T AGREE WITH IT  (fe_03_06597-A-0006)
AND I THINK THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE A DUTY TO NOT CENSOR THINGS  (fe_03_06597-A-0007)
HOWEVER  (fe_03_06597-A-0008)
BECAUSE KIDS ARE NOT ADULTS SOMETIMES SHOULD BE  (fe_03_06597-A-0009)
YOU KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME GUIDANCE IN WHAT THEY READ AND WHAT'S AGE APPROPRIATE  (fe_03_06597-A-0010)
BUT  (fe_03_06597-A-0011)
I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT  (fe_03_06597-A-0012)
HIDING FROM CERTAIN KINDS OF LITERATURE REALLY DOES ALL THAT MUCH GOOD IN THE LONG RUN  (fe_03_06597-A-0013)
UH  (fe_03_06597-A-0014)
WELL YEAH IT KIND OF HANGS IN BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT'S AGE APPROPRIATE THOUGH AND LIKE WELL DID YOU KNOW THAT IN BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO READ THE MERCHANTS OF VENICE BECAUSE OF THE  (fe_03_06597-A-0015)
SENTIMENT IN IT  (fe_03_06597-A-0016)
I'M NOT SURE IF I AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I DON'T  (fe_03_06597-A-0017)
THAT PART OF THE PLAY MAKES ME SAD  (fe_03_06597-A-0018)
I DON'T THINK THAT HIDING FROM THAT BOOK IS REALLY A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE I THINK KIDS ARE MISSING OUT ON A VALUABLE  (fe_03_06597-A-0019)
UM  (fe_03_06597-A-0020)
HISTORY LESSON  (fe_03_06597-A-0021)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-A-0022)
SEE THE WHOLE  (fe_03_06597-A-0023)
THE FACT THAT IT'S SCHOOL IN FACT LIKE COLLEGE AND SCHOOL AND REGULAR SCHOOL I THINK ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS  (fe_03_06597-A-0024)
AND I THINK THAT CENSORSHIP IN COLLEGE IS EVEN LESS OF A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE THAT'S FINE YOU'RE KIND OF EXPECTED TO BE AN ADULT  (fe_03_06597-A-0025)
BUT  (fe_03_06597-A-0026)
I DON'T KNOW WAS SHE GIVEN AN OUT TO AVOID READING IT  (fe_03_06597-A-0027)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-A-0028)
SEE NOT EVERYBODY MAY HAVE FOUND IT TO BE FILTH NECESSARILY  (fe_03_06597-A-0029)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-A-0031)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-A-0032)
WELL YEAH  (fe_03_06597-A-0033)
I THINK BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE TO  (fe_03_06597-A-0034)
REGULATE OUR OWN READING IS A DIFFERENT MATTER IT'S THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE AT LEAST GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE BOOK AT ALL  (fe_03_06597-A-0035)
I DON'T KNOW I HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE SAYING NO YOU CANNOT READ THIS THIS IS EVIL THIS IS BAD  (fe_03_06597-A-0036)
BECAUSE IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT WAY FOR EVERYBODY  (fe_03_06597-A-0037)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-A-0038)
MHM WELL  (fe_03_06597-A-0039)
SEE PARTLY I THINK IT'S THE FAULT OF THE TEACHER FOR NOT TRYING TO THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE  (fe_03_06597-A-0040)
BUT AT THE SAME TIME  (fe_03_06597-A-0041)
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FILTH ALLEGEDLY LIKE  (fe_03_06597-A-0043)
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT YOU ARE USED TO IS KIND OF HEALTHY I THINK  (fe_03_06597-A-0045)
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CONDONE THE THINKS THAT ARE IN THE BOOK BUT TO BE EXPOSED TO THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE BOOK AND TO LEARN ABOUT  (fe_03_06597-A-0046)
WHAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE DEAL WITH  (fe_03_06597-A-0047)
UM  (fe_03_06597-A-0048)
BUT  (fe_03_06597-A-0050)
I GUESS IF IT'S UPSETTING  (fe_03_06597-A-0051)
THAT'S A CHOICE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE FOR YOURSELF  (fe_03_06597-A-0052)
AND APPARENTLY SHE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR HERSELF ADEQUATELY IF THE TEACHER WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE HER AN ALTERNATIVE  (fe_03_06597-A-0053)
BUT  (fe_03_06597-A-0054)
YEAH  (fe_03_06597-A-0056)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-A-0057)
YEAH  (fe_03_06597-A-0058)
YEAH  (fe_03_06597-A-0059)
DO YOU REMEMBER ANY CENSORSHIP FROM YOUR GROWING UP AT ALL LIKE IN YOU SCHOOL  (fe_03_06597-A-0061)
LIKE DO YOU REMEMBER ANY KINDS OF LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL LIKE NO YOU SHOULD NOT READ THIS BOOK OR YES THIS BOOK IS BETTER THAN THAT BOOK BECAUSE  (fe_03_06597-A-0063)
OF THE VALUES THIS BOOK IS EVIL THIS BOOK IS NOT  (fe_03_06597-A-0064)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-A-0065)
SO LET'S SEE I WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MY EDUCATION  (fe_03_06597-A-0066)
AND I RAN INTO SITUATIONS WHERE BOOKS WERE BEING CENSORED AND I RAN INTO  (fe_03_06597-A-0067)
KIND OF THE OPPOSITE SITUATION WHICH WAS REALLY WEIRD UM  (fe_03_06597-A-0068)
MY SCHOOL HAD THIS KIND OF  (fe_03_06597-A-0069)
SYSTEM OF HAVING THE KIDS DO SUMMER READING AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SUMMER READING BUT THEY WANTED THE THIRD GRADERS GOING TO THE FOURTH GRADERS TO READ  (fe_03_06597-A-0070)
REALLY BIG BOOKS AND WRITE FULL BOOK REPORTS ABOUT THEM LIKE FOUR BOOK REPORTS ARE EXPECTED BY FALL AND ONE OF THE BOOKS THEY RECOMMENDED WAS A BOOK CALLED THE TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN  (fe_03_06597-A-0071)
HAVE YOU EVER READ THAT IT'S A PRETTY GOOD BOOK IT'S ABOUT UM TEENAGE GIRLS COMING OF AGE  (fe_03_06597-A-0072)
AND I READ IT IN COLLEGE AND I REALLY LIKED IT BUT I WAS IN COLLEGE  (fe_03_06597-A-0073)
AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO IN CHARGE OF THE SCHOOL WHO HAD RECOMMENDED THIS LIST HAD NOT EVEN READ THE BOOK  (fe_03_06597-A-0074)
AND THE BOOK WAS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIRD GRADERS  (fe_03_06597-A-0075)
AND I WAS REALLY SURPRISED BY THAT SO I SUPPOSE THAT WAS WHAT KIND OF WOKE ME UP TO THE IDEA THAT  (fe_03_06597-A-0076)
ALL CENSORSHIP ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA OVER ALL  (fe_03_06597-A-0077)
YOU DO NEED TO GIVE KIDS SOME GUIDANCE IN WHAT THEY'RE READING  (fe_03_06597-A-0078)
UM  (fe_03_06597-A-0079)
BUT EVEN THEN IT'S A VERY FINE LINE UM  (fe_03_06597-A-0080)
I THINK THERE'S DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GUIDELINES AND RULES BUT  (fe_03_06597-A-0081)
OH YEAH I'M NOT A FAN OF TELEVISION AT ALL I THINK IF PEOPLE THREW OUT THEIR TELEVISION THEY WOULD HAVE A LOT  (fe_03_06597-A-0082)
LESS OF A PROBLEM WITH  (fe_03_06597-A-0083)
KIDS AND JUST CULTURE IN GENERAL BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION  (fe_03_06597-A-0084)
NOT REALLY I WATCH PUBLIC AC- PUBLIC TELEVISION EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT  (fe_03_06597-A-0085)
EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST  (fe_03_06597-A-0086)
I'D RATHER BE CREATING SOMETHING  (fe_03_06597-A-0088)
I LIKE TO SEW  (fe_03_06597-A-0089)
BIG TIME  (fe_03_06597-A-0090)
SO  (fe_03_06597-A-0091)
HI  (fe_03_06597-B-0001)
I'M ELAINE AND I'M FROM GRAND RAPIDS MICHIGAN  (fe_03_06597-B-0002)
HI  (fe_03_06597-B-0003)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0004)
PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06597-B-0005)
CENSORING CERTAIN BOOKS  (fe_03_06597-B-0006)
MHM WELL THAT'S INTERESTING I  (fe_03_06597-B-0007)
DON'T SHARE YOUR VIEW POINT BUT UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0008)
I WOULD UM DEFINITELY BE IN FAVOR OF CENSORING  (fe_03_06597-B-0009)
UM LITERATURE I THINK CHILDREN  (fe_03_06597-B-0010)
UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0011)
ARE NOT OFTEN WISE ENOUGH TO MAKE RIGHT DECISIONS ABOUT UM WHAT THEY READ AND IT WOULD BE BETTER  (fe_03_06597-B-0012)
TO PROTECT THEM FROM SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE  (fe_03_06597-B-0013)
WELL  (fe_03_06597-B-0014)
FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE JUST ATTENDED MY UH NIECE'S HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION  (fe_03_06597-B-0015)
AND SHE WAS TELLING ME AND I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE BOOK BUT SHE WAS TELLING ME THAT THEIR UM LIT TEACHER UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0016)
TOLD THEM THEY HAD TO READ A CERTAIN BOOK AND SHE SAID NOW THAT WAS FILTH  (fe_03_06597-B-0017)
AND YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF MAKING  (fe_03_06597-B-0018)
STUDENTS READ SOMETHING THAT IS FILTH  (fe_03_06597-B-0019)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-B-0020)
I DON'T I DON'T THINK SO UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0021)
SHE  (fe_03_06597-B-0022)
I THINK THAT WAS THE ASSIGNMENT THAT WAS GIVEN  (fe_03_06597-B-0023)
THAT'S TRUE UM BECAUSE WHAT ONE PERSON DECIDES IS FILTH ANOTHER PERSON MAY NOT  (fe_03_06597-B-0024)
BUT UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0025)
I PERSONALLY COULD NOT SEE ANY POINT IN BEING FORCED TO READ SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE FILTH  (fe_03_06597-B-0026)
AND I DON'T THINK THAT MY I MEAN WHILE MY  (fe_03_06597-B-0027)
SISTER AND BROTHER IN LAW ARE RATHER UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0028)
WHAT SHOULD I SAY  (fe_03_06597-B-0029)
THEY HAVE  (fe_03_06597-B-0030)
THEY'RE SOMEWHAT PROTECTIVE I GUESS I SHOULD SAY  (fe_03_06597-B-0031)
I DON'T THINK THAT MY NIECE HAS BEEN UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0032)
PROTECTED FROM ALL THAT MUCH THAT SHE WOULD I MEAN I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO HEAR HER SAY IT I I WOULD OF THOUGHT SHE WOULD OF READ ANYTHING AND SAID THIS IS OUR ASSIGNMENT  (fe_03_06597-B-0033)
UH WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IT AND SO I DID IT AND WOULDN'T MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT IT BUT I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR HER SAY THAT  (fe_03_06597-B-0034)
AND THAT  (fe_03_06597-B-0035)
HOWEVER IF YOU GIVE THAT ASSIGNMENT TO EVERYBODY THEN THERE ARE GOING TO BE THOSE WHO PROBABLY I MEAN NOT EVERY BOOK OF COURSE BUT ARE GOING TO FIND SOME THINGS VERY OFFENSIVE AND IF THEY ARE  (fe_03_06597-B-0036)
UM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT LET'S SAY  (fe_03_06597-B-0037)
WHICH IS THE CASE OF MY NIECE UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0038)
IF IF YOU'RE TOLD THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN YOUR LIT CLASS WHAT OPTIONS DO YOU HAVE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW IF SHE ASKED FOR OPTIONS I KNOW THIS WAS ADVANCED LIT AND UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0039)
I RATHER IMAGINE SHE JUST THOUGHT THAT WHAT WAS ASSIGNED WAS EXPECTED TO BE DONE  (fe_03_06597-B-0040)
WELL  (fe_03_06597-B-0041)
UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0042)
I COME FROM A FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE BACKGROUND AND SO I WOULD CERTAINLY  (fe_03_06597-B-0043)
I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY WANT MY CHILDREN TO HAVE OPTIONS UM ABOUT WHAT THEY READ  (fe_03_06597-B-0044)
AND GUIDELINES VERY GOOD GUIDELINES ABOUT WHAT THEY READ IF THEY  (fe_03_06597-B-0045)
WHEN THEY'RE GIVEN ASSIGNMENTS BUT AS I SAID I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN SO THAT IS NOT A  (fe_03_06597-B-0046)
PROBLEM FOR ME  (fe_03_06597-B-0047)
IN MY WHAT  (fe_03_06597-B-0048)
NO I DON'T RECALL THAT  (fe_03_06597-B-0049)
WE ENCOUNTERED ANY KIND OF A THING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06597-B-0051)
UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0052)
WE COULD HAVE I WENT TO SCHOOL AND I GRADUATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO SO [LAUGHTER] I'M I YOU KNOW SOME THINGS UNDOUBTEDLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN BUT I DON'T RECALL THAT THAT UH WE WERE  (fe_03_06597-B-0053)
THAT ANYTHING EVEN THAT WAS SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD READ WAS OFFENSIVE TO ME IN ANY WAY  (fe_03_06597-B-0054)
NO  (fe_03_06597-B-0055)
MHM  (fe_03_06597-B-0056)
WELL  (fe_03_06597-B-0057)
UNFORTUNATELY IN MY OPINION KIDS ARE EXPOSED TO ENTIRELY TOO MUCH  (fe_03_06597-B-0058)
STUFF NOWADAYS ON TELEVISION AND THAT SO FORTH BUT  (fe_03_06597-B-0059)
SO DO YOU WATCH T._V.  (fe_03_06597-B-0060)
WHAT DO YOU CREATE  (fe_03_06597-B-0061)
WELL I READ UM  (fe_03_06597-B-0062)
A LOT  (fe_03_06597-B-0063)
