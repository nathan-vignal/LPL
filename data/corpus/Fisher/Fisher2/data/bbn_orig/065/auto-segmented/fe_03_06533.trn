HI  (fe_03_06533-A-0001)
I'M DIANA LONGQVIST FROM BUFFALO NEW YORK  (fe_03_06533-A-0002)
HEY  (fe_03_06533-A-0003)
HI HOW ARE YA  (fe_03_06533-A-0004)
I  (fe_03_06533-A-0005)
I WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT USED TO HAVE RANDOM DRUG TESTING AND IT WAS PRETTY MUCH MANDATORY EVERY TWO YEARS BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT IN A LONG TIME  (fe_03_06533-A-0006)
WELL IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL [SIGH] COMPANY AND I THINK THAT UM AFTER A WHILE I THINK THEY WERE UM I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS COST BECAUSE A LOT OF UH DOWNSIZING HAS HAPPENED BUT  (fe_03_06533-A-0007)
I THINK THE OTHER REASON WAS THAT THEY HAD PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE UM  (fe_03_06533-A-0008)
YOU KNOW TESTING POSITIVE IN SOME CASES AND THEN I THINK THEY WERE FORCED TO PUT THEM THROUGH REHAB [MN] BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REALLY FIRE THEM BECAUSE THEY FIGURE IT'S A LIKE A DISEASE  (fe_03_06533-A-0009)
OR IT'S A SICKNESS AND I THINK THAT MAYBE THEY JUST CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT ANYMORE  (fe_03_06533-A-0010)
I'M NOT SURE BUT I I KNOW THAT I'VE WORKED FOR THE COMPANY FOR EIGHT YEARS AND I WAS ONLY TESTED ONCE WHICH WAS IN THE BEGINNING  (fe_03_06533-A-0011)
AND THE FIRST TWO YEARS HAD PASSED I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE TESTED AGAIN AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN TESTED AND NO ONE ELSE AS FAR AS I KNOW EITHER  (fe_03_06533-A-0012)
[LIPSMACK] I'M ASSUMING THAT I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT WAS THE REASON I'M JUST ASSUMING THAT ON MY PART BECAUSE  (fe_03_06533-A-0014)
YOU KNOW OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND I THINK  (fe_03_06533-A-0015)
EVEN WITH NINE ELEVEN THEY HAD A LOT OF UH THEY WERE THEY IMMEDIATELY AFTER NINE ELEVEN BECAME MORE POLITICALLY CORRECT ON A LOT OF THINGS THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH SO BUT THEY BECAME MORE POLITICALLY CORRECT  (fe_03_06533-A-0016)
AND UH YOU KNOW AS FAR AS FLOATING HOLIDAYS AND THEY TOOK CERTAIN HOLIDAYS THEY WOULDN'T GIVE YOU OFF THEY GIVE YOU FLOATING HOLIDAYS TO ACCOMMODATE OTHER RELIGIONS  (fe_03_06533-A-0017)
YES  (fe_03_06533-A-0018)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06533-A-0019)
I THINK IT'S PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_06533-A-0020)
I THINK UH I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT AS AN INVASION OF YOUR PRIVACY BECAUSE IN FACT  (fe_03_06533-A-0021)
YOU KNOW IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT UH  (fe_03_06533-A-0022)
IT'S ONE THING IF YOU'RE NOT WORKING OR YOU KNOW UH YOU'RE DOING IT BECAUSE YOUR IT'S YOUR OWN JOB I MEAN THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO BUT WHEN YOU WORK IN A TEAM ATMOSPHERE  (fe_03_06533-A-0023)
I FEEL THAT IT'S AN ALMOST A NECESSITY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WORKING LIKE I DO IN SOME CASES ON MACHINERY  (fe_03_06533-A-0024)
MY SAFETY IS DEPENDANT AND SAFETY OF OTHERS IS DEPENDANT ON MY BEING ALERT  (fe_03_06533-A-0025)
WHICH OF COURSE A DRUG DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO BE IN A LOT OF CASES IT DOESN'T YOUR REACTION TIMES AND THINGS ARE ARE DELAYED  (fe_03_06533-A-0026)
AND I THINK IT'S JUST YOU KNOW EVEN MOOD SWINGS CAN CAUSE A LOT OF UH PROBLEMS WHICH ARE YOU KNOW YOUR YOU  (fe_03_06533-A-0027)
KNOW  (fe_03_06533-A-0028)
DIRECTLY RELATED TO DRUGS  (fe_03_06533-A-0029)
AND I I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING I THINK LIKE YOU SAID IT'S A WAKE UP CALL FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT OUT THERE YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND YOU CAN CHOOSE TO  (fe_03_06533-A-0030)
UH YOU KNOW GO TO WORK AND PAY YOUR BILLS AND DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE IF YOU'RE  (fe_03_06533-A-0031)
DRUG FREE THAT'S FINE BUT IF YOU'RE NOT  (fe_03_06533-A-0032)
YOU'RE YOU ARE AFFECTING OTHER PEOPLE NOT JUST YOURSELF  (fe_03_06533-A-0033)
WHETHER YOU'RE UNDER THE INFLUENCE AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT OR NOT  (fe_03_06533-A-0034)
AND I THINK IT AFFECTS RELATIONSHIPS WHICH AFFECT YOUR JOB AND I THINK IT AFFECTS FAMILIES  (fe_03_06533-A-0035)
YOU KNOW ALL IN ALL YOU KNOW NOT JUST  (fe_03_06533-A-0036)
YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY LIKE LET'S SAY YOUR SPOUSE AND YOUR CHILDREN BUT IT ALSO AFFECTS THE  (fe_03_06533-A-0037)
YOU KNOW YOUR  (fe_03_06533-A-0038)
S- SATELLITE FAMILY SO TO SPEAK YOU KNOW YOUR BROTHERS YOU SIBLINGS AND AND SISTERS AND FAMILY AND PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS AND THAT BECAUSE IT DOES AFFECT IF THEY ARE DOING DRUGS  (fe_03_06533-A-0039)
YES I AGREE YES  (fe_03_06533-A-0040)
WELL I DO YOU KNOW I HAVE A S- VERY SIMILAR SITUATION I HAVE UM  (fe_03_06533-A-0041)
AND AGAIN PEOPLE AT THE W- PLACE THAT I WORK AT UM HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO GO OUT AT LUNCH TIME OR WHATEVER AND THEY HAVE A FEW AND THEN THEY COME BACK AND YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE THE DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_06533-A-0042)
IN THEIR DEMEANOR YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN IN THEIR THE QUALITY OF WORK THAT THEY DO AND THE QUANTITY OF WORK THAT THEY DO ALSO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING UM  (fe_03_06533-A-0043)
[LIPSMACK] YOU KNOW THERE IS NO COMPARISON AS FAR AS BEFORE AND AFTER BECAUSE THERE'S A DEFINITE DIFFERENCE AND I THINK THAT  (fe_03_06533-A-0044)
IF IN FACT THEY DO DO THIS DRUG TESTING AND THAT I THINK IT WOULD MAKE THE ENTIRE WORK ATMOSPHERE A LOT LESS STRESSFUL  (fe_03_06533-A-0045)
AND BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T SAY FEELING THAT THEY HAVE TO  (fe_03_06533-A-0046)
MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE OR KEEP THE SECRET AND YOU KNOW ALL ALL OF THE THINGS THAT AFFECT EVERYBODY'S QUALITY OF WORK YOU KNOW I KNOW I'M  (fe_03_06533-A-0047)
I'M NOT REAL COMFORTABLE BECAUSE ONE PARTICULAR PERSON THAT GOES OUT AND DRINKS AND IT'S A WOMAN SHE BECOMES EXTREMELY VERBALLY ABUSIVE TO A LOT OF HER COWORKERS  (fe_03_06533-A-0048)
[LIPSMACK] OR EXTREMELY LOUD WHICH MAKES THEM UNCOMFORTABLE IN SOME CASES  (fe_03_06533-A-0049)
AND UM YOU KNOW I I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO THOSE PEOPLE TO HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR  (fe_03_06533-A-0050)
YOU KNOW IN THE WORKPLACE YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO OUT AND PARTY OR DO SOMETHING BUT IN THE WORKPLACE THERE JUST ISN'T I DON'T FEEL THERE'S THERE'S ROOM FOR THAT RIGHT  (fe_03_06533-A-0051)
AND THE DRUG TESTING THE RANDOM DRUG TESTING WOULD KEEP THEM A LITTLE MORE LEGAL  (fe_03_06533-A-0052)
YOU KNOW IF IN FACT THEY DID THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS LIKE THEY USED TO IN MY PARTICULAR CASE PEOPLE WOULD BE LESS APT TO  (fe_03_06533-A-0053)
FEEL THAT THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH IT ON A REGULAR BASIS THAN THEY DO NOW  (fe_03_06533-A-0054)
I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THE I BECAUSE IT WAS UH A UM  (fe_03_06533-A-0055)
UM  (fe_03_06533-A-0057)
[LIPSMACK] FOR HIRE IT WAS UH ONE OF THE STIPULATIONS FOR OF THEM TO SIGN A WAIVER WHEN THEY WERE HIRED TO ALLOW THEM TO RANDOM DRUG TEST THEM AND UM  (fe_03_06533-A-0058)
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IT'S NEVER REALLY COME UP AS A AS A DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ARE FOR OR AGAINST I MEAN THEY'LL OR AGAINST IT I THINK MOST PEOPLE EXPECTED IT BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT IT WAS  (fe_03_06533-A-0059)
UM A WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT THEIR SAFETY AND THEIR QUALITY AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE MAINTAINED FROM A COMPANY STANDPOINT  (fe_03_06533-A-0060)
AND UM  (fe_03_06533-A-0061)
YOU KNOW YOU YOU TALK ABOUT SOME DRUGS SOME DRUGS ARE I I I DON'T WANT TO SAY SAFE BUT ARE LESS AFFECTIVE  (fe_03_06533-A-0062)
OR A LO- A- AFFECTING OF PEOPLE AS FAR AS DANGER GOES YOU KNOW AND UH LET'S SAY SOMEBODY THAT GOT I DON'T KNOW SOME KIND OF P._C._B. OR SOME KIND OF COCAINE OR SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE DRAMATIC MOOD SWINGS  (fe_03_06533-A-0063)
COULD BECOME A REAL SAFETY THREAT  (fe_03_06533-A-0064)
AND I THINK PEOPLE RESPECTED THAT FROM THE COMPANY BUT THE- THEY'RE NOT DOING IT NOW  (fe_03_06533-A-0065)
[LIPSMACK] BUT THEY HAVE THAT OPTION I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S WHERE IT'S BOILS DOWN TO THEY PROBABLY FOUND THAT  (fe_03_06533-A-0066)
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WEREN'T SO THEY FELT IT WAS MAYBE  (fe_03_06533-A-0067)
NOT NECESSARY AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME THAT'S ANOTHER YOU KNOW THOUGHT THAT I'VE HAD AND IF THAT'S THE CASE WELL THEN [NOISE]  (fe_03_06533-A-0068)
[LIPSMACK] YOU KNOW MAYBE AT SOME TIME IF THEY FELT THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF SOMEBODY'S BEHAVIOR IF SOMEONE CHOSE TO TAKE THIS  (fe_03_06533-A-0069)
