I AGREE WITH THAT CERTAINLY  (fe_03_06595-A-0011)
AND THOUGH THERE ARE A FEW OCCASIONS WHERE UM  (fe_03_06595-A-0012)
IN BOSTON AREA PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHERE THEY TRIED NOT TO LET LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A LAW THAT NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF BUT SHAKESPEARE'S THE MERCHANT OF VENICE IS NOT PERMITTED TO BE READ IN BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF ANTI SEMITIC SENTIMENTS IN IT  (fe_03_06595-A-0013)

THE TEN COMMANDMENTS HAS TO BE POSTED HERE BECAUSE  (fe_03_06595-A-0027)
IT'S IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE MOST POPULAR RELIGION IN THIS PARTICULAR COUNTRY DOESN'T MEAN THAT  (fe_03_06595-A-0028)
IT'S THE ONLY ONE OR IT'S THE BEST ONE  (fe_03_06595-A-0029)
[SIGH] BUT LIKE I'M NOT A CHRISTIAN AND I KIND OF FIND IT OFFENSIVE WHEN PEOPLE PUT THAT IN MY FACE THEY JUST ASSUME THAT I'M A CHRISTIAN  (fe_03_06595-A-0030)

AND IT'S A PRETTY DIVERSE SCHOOL AND THE  (fe_03_06595-A-0042)
STUDENT BODY IS PRETTY  (fe_03_06595-A-0043)
LIKE AWARE OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND LIKE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS BEING FAIRLY REPRESENTED BUT STILL I  (fe_03_06595-A-0044)
FIND IT OVERWHELMINGLY  (fe_03_06595-A-0045)
AIMING JUST  (fe_03_06595-A-0046)
NOT REALLY AIMING I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY SETTLE INTO THE CHRISTIAN THING BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06595-A-0047)

YEAH  (fe_03_06595-A-0058)

SEE WHAT I FIND FUNNY ABOUT THE WHOLE OF IT IS THAT THE AUTHOR OF THOSE BOOKS SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT SHE INVENTED ALL OF THE  (fe_03_06595-A-0061)
SUPPOSED WITCHCRAFTNESS IN THE ENTIRE BOOK IT'S ALL PRETEND SO  (fe_03_06595-A-0062)
THEY'RE BURNING BOOKS THAT ARE LIKE FICTIONAL  (fe_03_06595-A-0063)
MAGIC ANYWAYS BUT I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06595-A-0064)
IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN IN DOUBT  (fe_03_06595-A-0065)
IT'S JUST BETTER TO ALLOW IT  (fe_03_06595-A-0066)
I DON'T KNOW IT'S KIND OF A RISKY STATEMENT BUT  (fe_03_06595-A-0067)
IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING I MEAN I'VE I HAD UM  (fe_03_06595-A-0069)
AN EXPERIENCE WITH  (fe_03_06595-A-0070)
JUST IMPROPERLY CHOSEN BOOKS FOR UM YOUNGER KIDS BECAUSE I WENT TO A CATHOLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  (fe_03_06595-A-0071)
AND THEY HAD THIS KIND OF DRACONIAN SUMMER READING PROGRAM LIKE WHEN YOU WERE GOING INTO THE FOURTH GRADE YOU WERE EXPECTED TO READ LIKE FOUR BOOKS AND WRITE FULL BOOK REPORTS ABOUT THEM  (fe_03_06595-A-0072)
AND A LOT OF PARENTS COMPLAINED BECAUSE THEY FELT LIKE CHAINED TO THIS HOMEWORK AND ONE OF THE BOOKS THAT THEY RECOMMENDED AMONG OTHERS WA- SIMILAR BOOKS WAS A BOOK CALLED THE TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN  (fe_03_06595-A-0073)
HAVE YOU EVER READ THAT  (fe_03_06595-A-0074)
IT'S A COMING OF AGE BOOK VERY MUCH GEARED FOR OLDER TEENAGERS  (fe_03_06595-A-0075)
I REALLY LIKED IT BUT I WAS ALSO IN COLLEGE WHEN I READ IT AND I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY RECOMMENDED THIS A CATHOLIC SCHOOL RECOMMENDED THIS FOR THIRD GOING INTO FOURTH GRADE  (fe_03_06595-A-0076)
AND  (fe_03_06595-A-0077)
CLEARLY IT TURNED OUT AFTER SOME QUESTIONING THAT THEY HAD NEVER EVEN READ THE BOOK  (fe_03_06595-A-0078)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06595-A-0079)
YEAH  (fe_03_06595-A-0080)
IT IS RIDICULOUS  (fe_03_06595-A-0081)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06595-A-0082)
LIKE  (fe_03_06595-A-0083)

YEAH  (fe_03_06595-A-0089)
HELLO  (fe_03_06595-B-0001)
HI  (fe_03_06595-B-0002)
OKAY THIS IS SHAKIER FROM PHILADELPHIA  (fe_03_06595-B-0003)
SO  (fe_03_06595-B-0004)
RIGHT AND DO PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE THE RIGHT TO UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0005)
ALLOW OR DISALLOW STUDENTS TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS I THINK THAT WAS RIGHT OKAY  (fe_03_06595-B-0006)
WELL LET'S SEE  (fe_03_06595-B-0007)
PUBLIC SCHOOLS I I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISALLOW STUDENTS TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS I MEAN  (fe_03_06595-B-0008)
IT IS GOVERNMENT FUN- FUNDED IF IT WAS A PRIVATE SCHOOL THEN I'D SAY YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0009)
THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT YOU KNOW IF PARENTS ARE PAYING FOR THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION  (fe_03_06595-B-0010)
THEN I WOULD SAY THE SCHOOL DOES HAVE THE RIGHT DEPENDING ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE PARENTS' VIEW WAS BUT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL I DON'T THINK THAT THEY REALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHAT BOOKS SHOULD BE READ  (fe_03_06595-B-0011)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0013)
THAT'S DEFINITELY A PART OF LIFE THOUGH I MEAN FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T READ THAT PARTICULAR BOOK IT'S  (fe_03_06595-B-0014)
I THINK IT'S GIVING KIDS A REALLY NARROW MIND OF I MEAN YOU YOU YOU HAVE TO TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN VIEWS OUT THERE NO MATTER HOW PLEASANT OR UNPLEASANT THAT THEY ARE DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND IT'S IT'S TOTALLY UNREALISTIC UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0015)
TO  (fe_03_06595-B-0016)
TO NOT WANT THEM TO ENCOUNTER ANTI SEMITIC LITERATURE  (fe_03_06595-B-0017)
YEAH  (fe_03_06595-B-0018)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0019)
I THINK THIS KIND OF FALLS IN LINE WITH THE  (fe_03_06595-B-0020)
WITH THE ISSUE OF WHETHER GOD SHOULD BE MENTIONED IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AH WHEN SOMETHING IS  (fe_03_06595-B-0021)
I DON'T KNOW I WHEN SOMETHING'S  (fe_03_06595-B-0022)
FUNDED BY THE BY THE GOVERNMENT LIKE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE I JUST THINK THAT IT'S SO  (fe_03_06595-B-0023)
IT'S SUCH AN ARRAY OF DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN'T EXPECT KIDS TO YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] TO TO JUST HAVE THIS KIND OF FOCUS KIND OF CURRICULUM I GUESS  (fe_03_06595-B-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0025)
RIGHT AND NEITHER AM I [LAUGHTER] SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING  (fe_03_06595-B-0026)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0027)
RIGHT ACTUALLY IT'S PRETTY FUNNY BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0028)
I WENT TO A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY  (fe_03_06595-B-0029)
AND ONE OF THE REQUIR- READINGS FOR THE SCHOOL WAS AND I'M NOT SURE IF THE IF THE TOPIC IS FOR JUST ELEMENTARY LEVEL SCHOOLS OR MIDDLE SCHOOLS OR WHAT  (fe_03_06595-B-0030)
BUT FOR THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL WE HAD THIS CLASS THAT WE HAD TO UM IN THIS CLASS WE HAD TO  (fe_03_06595-B-0031)
WELL ACTUALLY EVERYONE HAD TO TAKE INTELLECTUAL HERITAGE  (fe_03_06595-B-0032)
AND IN INTELLECTUAL HERITAGE YOU WERE BASICALLY IN THERE'S ONE IN TWO AND YOU'RE BASICALLY READING THE THE MAIN WORKS OF  (fe_03_06595-B-0033)
I GUESS CIVILIZATION SO TO SPEAK LIKE WE WE READ A LOT OF UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0034)
A LOT OF MACHIAVELLI AND WHATEVER IN THE SECOND PART BUT IN THE FIRST PART WE READ DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS TEXTS AND I FELT LIKE THEY CONCENTRATED MORE ON THE BIBLE THAN OTHER RELIGIOUS TEXTS  (fe_03_06595-B-0035)
AND AND IT WASN'T JUST MY OWN YOU KNOW PERSONAL VIEW OTHER PEOPLE EXPRESSED THE SAME VIEW AND I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT THAT IT'S ALONG THE SAME LINES IS THAT  (fe_03_06595-B-0036)
THAT ALTHOUGH YOU'RE BEING TOTALLY INCLUSIVE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SHOWING FAVORITISM OVER ONE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0037)
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND THIS IS A PUBLIC  (fe_03_06595-B-0038)
UNIVERSITY  (fe_03_06595-B-0039)
BUT IT'S TAUGHT BY INDIVIDUALS SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO  (fe_03_06595-B-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_06595-B-0041)
MHM  (fe_03_06595-B-0042)
SURE  (fe_03_06595-B-0043)
AND IT I THINK IT'S EASIER I THINK IN A WAY IT'S A SAFE WAY TO GO YOU KNOW THAT IF PEOPLE ARE CHRISTIANS AND THEY'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO IT AND YOU KNOW IF THEY ARE NON CHRISTIAN AND THEY LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY THEY'RE PROBABLY USED TO HEARING ABOUT IT ANYWAY SO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06595-B-0044)
SO AND YEAH IT'S A SAFE WAY TO GO BUT I DID HEAR ABOUT SOME PROFESSORS WHO REALLY  (fe_03_06595-B-0045)
JUST UNJUSTLY CRITICIZED OTHER RELIGIOUS TEXTS AND MAKE YOU KNOW REALLY PREJUDICE COMMENTS ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS  (fe_03_06595-B-0046)
AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHETHER KIDS CAN READ OR NOT READ CERTAIN THINGS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THESE COURSES ARE GOING TO BE TAUGHT BY INDIVIDUALS AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THEIR OWN PREJUDICES ABOUT THINGS EITHER WAY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06595-B-0047)
AND EVEN THOUGH  (fe_03_06595-B-0048)
SOME THINGS UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0049)
I DON'T KNOW I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY LIKE UM THINGS LIKE THAT ARE TOO MITCHELL WERE FOR LIKE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS OR WHATEVER SHOULDN'T BE READ IN PUBLIC SCHOOL LIKE UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0050)
THIS IS TOTALLY OFF THE TOPIC BUT THERE WAS ONE THING  (fe_03_06595-B-0051)
DO YOU REMEMBER THE WHOLE HARRY POTTER THING I DON'T KNOW WHICH STATE IT WAS IN IT WAS IN A SOUTHERN STATE AND THERE WAS UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0052)
I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK IT WAS A CHURCH MAYBE LIKE A SCHOOL OR SOMETHING WHERE THEY BURNED ALL THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS  (fe_03_06595-B-0053)
BECAUSE OF THE WITCHCRAFT  (fe_03_06595-B-0054)
AND I DON'T KNOW SEE I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IF IT WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL OR NOT BUT  (fe_03_06595-B-0055)
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S LIKE THAT'S A REALLY SENSITIVE TOPIC AND I GUESS THAT THAT'S MY OWN PREJUDICE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE  (fe_03_06595-B-0056)
WITCHCRAFT ISN'T REALLY MAINSTREAM AND FOR IT TO BE TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL WHERE I WOULD ASSUME THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE FOLLOW ONE OF THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT RELIGIONS YOU KNOW THAT'S A REALLY SOFT THAT'S A SOFT SPOT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_06595-B-0057)
AND THAT KIND OF THING I WOULD THINK THAT YOU SHOULD SEEK A PARENT'S APPROVAL BEFORE YOU PRESENT THAT TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING BUT IT'S SO POPULAR AMONGST KIDS I DON'T KNOW I GUESS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OKAY  (fe_03_06595-B-0058)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0059)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0060)
MHM  (fe_03_06595-B-0061)
YEAH  (fe_03_06595-B-0062)

RIGHT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT BOOK  (fe_03_06595-B-0065)
HM  (fe_03_06595-B-0066)

THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY  (fe_03_06595-B-0068)
THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY  (fe_03_06595-B-0069)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0070)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06595-B-0071)
AND IT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M WHAT I'M THINKING IS THAT WHEN YOU SAY  (fe_03_06595-B-0072)
PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS JUST A BUNCH OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SITTING ON A BOARD WHO ARE DECIDING HOW THINGS SHOULD GO  (fe_03_06595-B-0073)
AND EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR OWN OPINION AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE READ AND AND WHAT AGE KIDS ARE GOING TO BE READY TO EXPERIENCE WHAT AND IT'S JUST A FINE LINE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN FOR ONE PERSON UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0074)
AH I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST UM  (fe_03_06595-B-0075)
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T [LAUGHTER] I WAS GOING TO SAY MAYBE THEY SHOULD JUST STAY AWAY FROM BOOKS JUST TEACH LIKE MATH AND SCIENCE AND LIKE REALLY REALLY SAFE LITERATURE OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_06595-B-0076)
