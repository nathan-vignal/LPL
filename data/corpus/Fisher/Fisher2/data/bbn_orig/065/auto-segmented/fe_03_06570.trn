NO IT HASN'T CHANGED MY VIEWS ON MARRIAGE I CAN'T SAY I CAN'T SAY THAT REALLY THE DIVORCE RATE HAS CHANGED MUCH OF  (fe_03_06570-B-0017)
ANYTHING I THINK MORE OR LESS ANYTHING THAT'S CHANGED ANYTHING IS MY MATURITY RATE YOU KNOW I'M OLDER NOW SO YOU SEE THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT  (fe_03_06570-B-0018)
YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE  (fe_03_06570-B-0019)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06570-B-0020)
SO I THINK UH PROBABLY NOT [MN] AS FAR AS THE DIVORCE RATE NO IT HASN'T CHANGED MUCH AT ALL  (fe_03_06570-B-0021)
UM  (fe_03_06570-B-0022)
BUT  (fe_03_06570-B-0023)
I WAS ONE OF THOSE [MN] STRANGE PEOPLE THAT UH I CAN'T SAY I DID A WHOLE LOT OF DATING BEFORE I MET MY HUSBAND AND I WAS  (fe_03_06570-B-0024)
REALLY INTERESTED IN FINDING THE PERSON THAT GOD INTENDED FOR ME TO BE WITH  (fe_03_06570-B-0025)
AND  (fe_03_06570-B-0026)
I THINK EVEN THEN I KNEW THAT THERE WAS SO MANY KIDS  (fe_03_06570-B-0027)
GETTING MARRIED WAY TOO YOUNG AND THEN WHEN THEY GROW UP THEY'RE NOT THE SAME PEOPLE ANY MORE  (fe_03_06570-B-0028)
AND  (fe_03_06570-B-0029)
THEY GET MARRIED FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS OR  (fe_03_06570-B-0030)
[NOISE] MAYBE THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT COURSE MY BROTHER SURPRISED ME WITH SAYING YOU KNOW NOBODY EVER GETS MARRIED WITH THE INTENTIONS OF GETTING DIVORCED  (fe_03_06570-B-0031)
AND I GUESS THAT'S TRUE BUT  (fe_03_06570-B-0032)
OH THAT'S HARD  (fe_03_06570-B-0033)
YEAH  (fe_03_06570-B-0035)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06570-B-0036)
MM  (fe_03_06570-B-0037)
I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SURE THAT I EVER EVEN  (fe_03_06570-B-0038)
CONSIDERED DIVORCE AN OPTION I THOUGHT YOU KNOW I I OF  (fe_03_06570-B-0039)
COURSE IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER BACK REALLY WHAT I THOUGHT BUT [NOISE]  (fe_03_06570-B-0040)
I DON'T KNOW I I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT YOU GOT MARRIED AND STUCK IT OUT FOR LIFE YOU KNOW IT IT THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU DID ALSO MY BROTHER WAS DIVORCED HE GOT DIVORCED HE'S BEEN DIVORCED TWICE AND I HAVE A SISTER THAT'S BEEN  (fe_03_06570-B-0041)
DIVORCED THREE OR FOUR TIMES I THINK  (fe_03_06570-B-0042)
I'M NOT SURE I HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING UP WITH 'EM  (fe_03_06570-B-0043)
AND UH BUT MY MOM AND MY DAD WERE MARRIED FOR YEARS COURSE MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS VERY VERY YOUNG  (fe_03_06570-B-0044)
BUT SHE NEVER REMARRIED NEVER EVEN DATED  (fe_03_06570-B-0045)
AFTER MY DAD PASSED AWAY  (fe_03_06570-B-0046)
SO THAT THAT PROBABLY MORE OR LESS BUILT MORE OF MY  (fe_03_06570-B-0047)
THAN ANYTHING  (fe_03_06570-B-0048)
BUT I I DO NOTICE THAT THE DIVORCE  (fe_03_06570-B-0049)
AS FAR AS FOR MY CHILDREN  (fe_03_06570-B-0050)
HOW IT AFFECTS US  (fe_03_06570-B-0051)
IS THAT I FEEL LIKE MY CHILDREN ARE NOT THE NORM OUR FAMILY IS NOT THE NORM  (fe_03_06570-B-0052)
OUR FAMILY IS MORE  (fe_03_06570-B-0053)
THE  (fe_03_06570-B-0054)
EXCEPTION  (fe_03_06570-B-0055)
BECAUSE [MN] THERE ARE MORE CHILDREN THAT  (fe_03_06570-B-0056)
THAT MY KIDS WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THAT ARE FROM DIVORCED FAMILIES THAN THERE WERE FROM FAMILIES THAT  (fe_03_06570-B-0057)
WERE STILL TOGETHER  (fe_03_06570-B-0058)
MHM  (fe_03_06570-B-0059)
SO I I THINK THAT MADE THAT MUCH DIFFERENT FOR MY KIDS  (fe_03_06570-B-0060)
UH  (fe_03_06570-B-0062)
IT CHANGED THINGS AS FAR AS HOW  (fe_03_06570-B-0063)
BECAUSE I KNOW  (fe_03_06570-B-0064)
IT WAS ALWAYS  (fe_03_06570-B-0065)
UH DIFFERENT FOR ME TO SAY OKAY WELL WHERE DO I TAKE 'EM ARE THEY WITH THEIR MOM THIS WEEKEND OR ARE [LAUGHTER] THEY WITH THEIR DAD THIS WEEKEND WHO ARE THEY WITH  (fe_03_06570-B-0066)

[NOISE] MHM  (fe_03_06570-B-0069)
YEAH  (fe_03_06570-B-0070)
I KNOW I CAN REMEMBER GROWING UP THINKING THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT SEEMED LIKE THEY ACTUALLY HATED EACH OTHER SO YOU WONDERED WHY THAT THEY BA- WHY DID THEY STAY MARRIED TO EACH OTHER  (fe_03_06570-B-0071)
BUT THEN AFTER I GOT OLDER I REALIZED THAT SOME RELATIONSHIPS THAT'S JUST HOW THEY GET ALONG  (fe_03_06570-B-0072)
THAT'S JUST HOW THEY GET ALONG THEY WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITHOUT EACH OTHER  (fe_03_06570-B-0073)
BUT  (fe_03_06570-B-0074)
THEY FUSS CONTINUOUSLY  (fe_03_06570-B-0075)
SO I MEAN I GUESS THERE'S IF IT WORKS FOR THEM THEN  (fe_03_06570-B-0076)
