OH HOW WEIRD  (fe_03_06516-A-0010)
[LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] IT SAID THE QUESTION IS HOW DO HOW DO EACH OF YOU FEEL ABOUT THE PRACTISE OF COMPANIES TESTING EMPLOYEES FOR DRUGS  (fe_03_06516-A-0011)
AND DO YOU FEEL UNANNOUNCED SPOT CHECKING DRUGS TO BE AN INVASION OF A PERSON'S PRIVACY  (fe_03_06516-A-0012)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06516-A-0013)
YOU THINK THE SPOT CHECKING IS AN INVASION OF PRIVACY  (fe_03_06516-A-0014)
WELL YOU KNOW I I GUESS MY WHOLE FEELING ABOUT THE ABOUT THE DRUG ISSUE IS  (fe_03_06516-A-0015)
IN YOU KNOW THIS SOCIETY WHERE  (fe_03_06516-A-0016)
MORALS HAVE RADICALLY ALTERED  (fe_03_06516-A-0017)
IT COMES WITH THE TERRITORY I MEAN THERE'S  (fe_03_06516-A-0018)
YOU KNOW I WORKED IN A IN A  (fe_03_06516-A-0019)

YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE KNOWN IF THESE PEOPLE WERE DOING DRUGS  (fe_03_06516-A-0023)
SO I I JUST THINK WHEN THE WHEN SOCIETY MOVES THE DIRECTION WE'VE MOVED THEN IT'S PART OF THE TERRITORY IT IT'S AN ACCOUNTABILITY THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE  (fe_03_06516-A-0024)
FOR FOR MOST  (fe_03_06516-A-0025)

THE WAY THEY'RE COMING DOWN ON PEOPLE  (fe_03_06516-A-0076)
