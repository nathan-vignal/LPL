I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD DRUG TEST FOR MARIJUANA I THINK THEY SHOULD DRUG TEST FOR STRONGER DRUGS  (fe_03_06553-A-0012)
YEAH I THINK THAT MARIJUANA IS SIMILAR TO ALCOHOL AND THEY DON'T REALLY TEST FOR ALCOHOL SO  (fe_03_06553-A-0013)
I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD TEST FOR COCAINE HEROIN VICODIN ALL THOSE THINGS  (fe_03_06553-A-0014)
NO I THINK THEY TEST FOR EVERYTHING  (fe_03_06553-A-0015)
THEY TEST FOR EVERYTHING AND MARIJUANA BUT I THINK IT'S A CERTAIN LEVEL THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR  (fe_03_06553-A-0016)
