UM BUT IF THEY'RE TEACHING CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT  (fe_03_06594-A-0024)
I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS BACK OR MAYBE SEVERAL YEARS BACK THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT REMOVING THE WHOLE HITLER  (fe_03_06594-A-0025)
SECTION FROM ALL THE HISTORY BOOKS  (fe_03_06594-A-0026)
UM AND TO PRETEND LIKE THE  (fe_03_06594-A-0027)

COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06594-A-0039)
IN TERMS OF THE WAY THEY'RE TOLD  (fe_03_06594-A-0040)

I GUESS THE NEW GENERATION THAT WOULD BE LEARNING UM  (fe_03_06594-A-0044)
YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WAS HISTORY OR WHAT NOT  (fe_03_06594-A-0045)

RIGHT  (fe_03_06594-A-0052)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06594-A-0053)
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BALANCE BUT THE HARDEST THING TO DEFINE THE BALANCE IS YOU DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN DEFINITION OF WHAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT AND WHAT SHOULD NOT BE  (fe_03_06594-A-0054)
AND IT'S FINDING THAT BALANCE  (fe_03_06594-A-0055)
I THINK  (fe_03_06594-A-0056)
MHM  (fe_03_06594-A-0058)

AND SO I'M I'M JUST ASSUMING THAT IN THE SCHOOLS WHAT THEY TEACH  (fe_03_06594-A-0070)
UM  (fe_03_06594-A-0071)

BUT I BECAUSE ALL THE MONEY BASICALLY GOES INTO LIKE THE SUBWAY SYSTEMS AND SHOPPING YOU KNOW JUST MAINTAINING  (fe_03_06594-A-0074)

AND I THINK YOU KNOW LIKE COLORADO IS ALSO DIFFERENT FROM NEW YORK  (fe_03_06594-A-0080)
IT'S EVERY STATE I THINK IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT AND JUST BECAUSE WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE DOESN'T MEAN THAT OUR KIDS ARE LEARNING THE SAME THING  (fe_03_06594-A-0081)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06594-A-0082)

NO ACTUALLY CLOSER TO ALBANY  (fe_03_06594-B-0007)
YES  (fe_03_06594-B-0008)
RIGHT IF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE A RIGHT TO TELL STUDENTS TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS  (fe_03_06594-B-0009)
I HAVE SORT OF A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I'M A HOME SCHOOLER  (fe_03_06594-B-0010)
AND I'M ONE I SO I DON'T THINK THAT THEY REALLY SHOULD TELL STUDENTS THEY HAVE TO READ A CERTAIN BOOK BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME BOOKS I WOULDN'T WANT MY KIDS TO READ AND IF THEY SAID THEY HAD TO READ A CERTAIN BOOK I WOULD PROBABLY  (fe_03_06594-B-0011)
IF MY KIDS HAD GONE TO SCHOOL I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE LET THEM  (fe_03_06594-B-0012)
WELL  (fe_03_06594-B-0013)
I GUESS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND IS LIKE  (fe_03_06594-B-0014)
AYN RAND  (fe_03_06594-B-0015)
I HAD TO READ ONE OF HER BOOKS IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS REALLY NOT  (fe_03_06594-B-0016)
SO BAD BUT UM SOME OF THE OTHER BOOKS OF HERS I'VE READ  (fe_03_06594-B-0017)
WELL IT'S THIS  (fe_03_06594-B-0018)
OH  (fe_03_06594-B-0019)
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT SHE REALLY WRITES I GUESS IT'S SORT OF LIKE A POLITICAL  (fe_03_06594-B-0020)
THING  (fe_03_06594-B-0021)
YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_06594-B-0022)
I WISH I COULD REMEMBER IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I READ HER BOOKS  (fe_03_06594-B-0023)
BUT CERTAIN AND THEN THERE'S ALSO CERTAIN OTHER BOOKS THAT PROBABLY SCHOOLS WOULDN'T HAVE THEM READ BUT I WOULD BE REAL UPSET IF MY THEY TOLD MY KIDS THEY HAD TO READ SOMETHING LIKE UM A STEPHEN KING BOOK  (fe_03_06594-B-0024)
WELL ACTUALLY  (fe_03_06594-B-0025)
UM  (fe_03_06594-B-0026)
IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT ACTUALLY THE TEXT BOOKS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE CENSORED ALREADY I AND I WAS READING NOT TOO LONG AGO ABOUT UM  (fe_03_06594-B-0027)
A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH AMERICAN INDIANS  (fe_03_06594-B-0028)
THAT UM THEY WANT TO CHANGE AND STUFF AND AND REALLY YOU CAN'T CHANGE HISTORY THE WAY IT HAPPENED IT HAPPENED THE WAY IT DID  (fe_03_06594-B-0029)
AND YOU CAN SAY YOU CAN CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT LOOK ALL NICE AND PRETTY BUT IT'S NOT REALLY  (fe_03_06594-B-0030)
RIGHT WELL LIKE LIKE IN WORLD WAR TWO WHEN WE WHEN WE PUT JAPANESE IN INTERNMENT CAMPS THAT WAS VERY WRONG AND IT WAS VERY SAD THAT WE DID THAT BUT WE CAN'T JUST SAY WE WELL WE DIDN'T DO THAT WHEN WE DID  (fe_03_06594-B-0032)
YES WELL I SEE BOTH I SEE LIKE TWO EXTREMES BECAUSE THERE'S THAT EXTREME AND THEN THERE'S THE OTHER EXTREME  (fe_03_06594-B-0033)
WHERE CHRISTIANS TRIED TO I AM A CHRISTIAN SO IT'S NOT LIKE I AM BAD MOUTHING [LAUGHTER] SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BUT BUT I SEE CHRISTIANS IN THE ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE WHERE THEY TRY TO MAKE ALL THE FOUNDING FATHERS OUT TO BE CHRISTIANS WELL THEY WEREN'T A LOT OF 'EM WERE UNITARIANS AND  (fe_03_06594-B-0034)
AND BUT THEY TRIED BUT THEY TRIED TO DO LIKE THE OPPOSITE WHERE THEY TRIED TO SANITIZE EVERYTHING  (fe_03_06594-B-0035)
AND EVEN THE PURITANS AND THE  (fe_03_06594-B-0036)
WERE VERY UM  (fe_03_06594-B-0037)
PREJUDICED AGAINST PEOPLE LIKE THE QUAKERS THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET THE QUAKERS COME TO THEIR THEIR COLONY SO YOU CAN'T  (fe_03_06594-B-0038)
SO THERE'S THE OTHER SIDE TOO [LAUGHTER] WHERE YOU CAN MAKE THINGS LOOK TOO GOOD OR TOO BAD OR OR  (fe_03_06594-B-0039)
UM  (fe_03_06594-B-0040)
RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY  (fe_03_06594-B-0041)
THE THERE'S SUCH A BIG RISE IN HOME SCHOOLING BECAUSE  (fe_03_06594-B-0042)
UM PARENTS WANT THEIR DON'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN TAUGHT FROM A CERTAIN VIEWPOINT AND IT'S NOT JUST FROM A CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT EITHER THERE'S A LOT A  (fe_03_06594-B-0043)
LOT OF PEOPLE HOME SCHOOL FROM A LIBERAL VIEWPOINT WHERE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR CHILDREN TAUGHT THE CONSERVATIVE STUFF TOO [SIGH]  (fe_03_06594-B-0044)
I DON'T I MEAN I HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE  (fe_03_06594-B-0045)
THAT'S NOT MY VIEWPOINT BUT I DO KNOW PEOPLE FROM THAT VIEWPOINT  (fe_03_06594-B-0046)
SO I I JUST THINK THAT IF I THINK THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS BECAUSE PARENTS DON'T HAVE  (fe_03_06594-B-0047)
THAT'S  (fe_03_06594-B-0048)
FOR PROBABLY TWENTY YEARS PARENTS DIDN'T TAKE A VERY ACTIVE ROLE IN THE SCHOOL WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE SCHOOL AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY LIKE WOKE UP AND SAW THAT SCHOOLS WERE BAD AND IF THEY HAD REALLY BEEN PAYING ATTENTION ALL ALONG THEY COULD HAVE KEPT THINGS  (fe_03_06594-B-0049)
UM FROM GETTING TO THAT POINT THERE'S  (fe_03_06594-B-0050)
A LOT OF THINGS THAT LIVING IN NEW YORK IS  (fe_03_06594-B-0051)
INTERESTING BECAUSE  (fe_03_06594-B-0052)
WELL THE STUFF OF THE BUDGET AND EVERYTHING AND AND IT'S LIKE IF WE POUR MORE MONEY INTO THE SCHOOLS IT WILL MAKE IT OKAY AND IT DOESN'T MAKE IT OKAY AT ALL [COUGH]  (fe_03_06594-B-0053)
WELL THE POINT IS I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS IF YOU USE YOUR MONEY WISELY  (fe_03_06594-B-0054)
WHICH THEY DON'T AND OUR OUR PUBLIC WE'VE GOT A REALLY SMALL TOWN AND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS TO PAY  (fe_03_06594-B-0055)
[SIGH] I THINK LIKE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY OF FINES BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T THEY HAVEN'T DONE CERTAIN THINGS LIKE FIX CERTAIN THINGS IN THE SCHOOL AND AND INSTEAD OF  (fe_03_06594-B-0056)
INSTEAD OF PAYING THE FINES WHY DON'T JUST FIX IT BUT [SIGH] I DON'T KNOW IT'S THINGS LIKE THAT THAT JUST  (fe_03_06594-B-0057)
AH THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO PAY SO MUCH MONEY FOR OUR TAXES FOR EDUCATION BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS IS JUST NOT DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE FIRST PLACE  (fe_03_06594-B-0058)
OH I'M SURE IT IS [LAUGHTER] I LIVED IN ARIZONA BEFORE I LIVED HERE  (fe_03_06594-B-0059)
I DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT NEW YORK CITY AT ALL  (fe_03_06594-B-0060)
MHM  (fe_03_06594-B-0061)
WELL I KNOW IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 'CAUSE I LIVED IN TUCSON ARIZONA FOR A WHILE AND I I CAME FROM NORTH WEST PENNSYLVANIA SO EVEN GOING FROM THERE TO TUCSON WAS JUST TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06594-B-0062)
THE CULTURE YOU'D THINK IT WAS ALL UNITED STATES BUT IT'S SO DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06594-B-0063)
RIGHT I MEAN JUST TO SEE HOW PEOPLE INTERACT I MEAN I CAME FROM A RELATIVELY SMALL TOWN AND IF YOU SAW SOMEBODY YOU KNEW IT WAS LIKE HI HOW ARE YOU DOING AND  (fe_03_06594-B-0064)
I WENT TO TUCSON AND PEOPLE THERE ARE JUST [LAUGHTER] SO DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06594-B-0065)
I MEAN YOU COULD COULD UM WALK ON THE STREET AND SOMEBODY YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE GOING TO  (fe_03_06594-B-0066)
THIS  (fe_03_06594-B-0067)
IS I I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST AND I THINK THAT EDUCATION IS LIKE THAT TOO  (fe_03_06594-B-0068)
AND  (fe_03_06594-B-0069)
SO WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT MOVE FROM ONE AREA OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_06594-B-0070)
IT'S I THINK IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH EDUCATION 'CAUSE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THIS STUFF  (fe_03_06594-B-0071)
YEAH I'M JUST GETTING OVER A COLD  (fe_03_06594-B-0073)
WELL IT'S LAST TIME THEY CALLED ABOUT THIS SAME TIME SO LIKE WE SCREEN OUR PHONE CALLS SO AS SOON AS I  (fe_03_06594-B-0074)
