HI THIS IS LISA  (fe_03_06514-A-0001)
HI JULIE  (fe_03_06514-A-0002)
UM WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I- I'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT TOO MUCH AS FAR AS WATCHING TRIALS ON T._V. ESPECIALLY HIGH PROFILE ONES HAVE YOU  (fe_03_06514-A-0003)
MHM  (fe_03_06514-A-0004)
[SIGH] NO I CAN'T SAY I HAVE JUST UM ANYTHING THAT WAS PICKED UP BY NEWSPAPERS OR NEWSPAPERS NEWS THE T._V. NEWS [SIGH] BUT I REALLY I DON'T HAVE THE TIME FOR THAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06514-A-0005)
YOU KNOW AND I'M JUST YOU KNOW IF I'M WATCHING T._V. I WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED AND I DON'T FIND THAT TO BE  (fe_03_06514-A-0006)
LIKE REALLY ENTERTAINING  (fe_03_06514-A-0007)
MHM  (fe_03_06514-A-0010)
SO YOU THINK IT HAD AN IMPACT BASICALLY THE PUBLIC OPINION  (fe_03_06514-A-0012)
THE WAY  (fe_03_06514-A-0013)
MHM  (fe_03_06514-A-0014)
[LIPSMACK] SO DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S  (fe_03_06514-A-0015)
THE CASE WITH OTHER TELEVISED TRIALS TOO OR OR JUST THE HIGH PROFILE ONES MHM  (fe_03_06514-A-0016)
RIGHT I THINK SO  (fe_03_06514-A-0018)
YEAH AND THAT  (fe_03_06514-A-0019)
MHM MHM MHM [NOISE] YEAH WITH THAT TRIAL YEAH [SIGH] BUT I YOU KNOW I I KINDA WONDER NOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AND NOW THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT IS YOU KNOW DOES IT MAKE US  (fe_03_06514-A-0020)
BETTER  (fe_03_06514-A-0021)
CITIZENS TO WATCH THESE THINGS OR DOES IT ACTUALLY MAKE US MORE JADED  (fe_03_06514-A-0022)
AS YOU KNOW JUST A POPULATION  (fe_03_06514-A-0023)
OR DO DO WE DO WE BELIEVE IN WHAT WE SEE OR OR DO WE  (fe_03_06514-A-0024)
YOU KNOW DO WE BECOME CYNICAL BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE  (fe_03_06514-A-0025)
BECAUSE I I HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF DEALINGS WITH COURTS  (fe_03_06514-A-0026)
PERSONALLY I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY HAD JURY DUTY I'VE BEEN CALLED SEVERAL TIMES BUT I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER BEEN CHOSEN [SIGH] SO I REALLY HAVE YOU KNOW A VERY LIMITED SCOPE  (fe_03_06514-A-0027)
AS A FRAME OF REFERENCE AND  (fe_03_06514-A-0028)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06514-A-0029)
IF THERE [SIGH] IF THESE ARE BEING PUT OUT THERE ON T._V. [SIGH] ARE THE ATTORNEYS CHANGING THE WAY THEY'RE TRYING CASES ARE JUDGES CHANGING THE WAY THEY INTERPRET RULES  (fe_03_06514-A-0030)
YOU KNOW HOW HOW ARE THINGS AFFECTED  (fe_03_06514-A-0031)
BY BY BEING ON T._V. BY THE POSSIBILITY OF GAINING THIS NOTORIETY THIS CELEBRITY  (fe_03_06514-A-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_06514-A-0034)
SO THEN ARE PEOPLE GETTING FAIR TRIALS  (fe_03_06514-A-0036)
LIKE BY HAVING IT ON T._V. MHM  (fe_03_06514-A-0037)
RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_06514-A-0039)

RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SO INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU USED THE TERM CONSUMER AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BECOME WE- WE'RE JUST  (fe_03_06514-A-0042)
CONSUMERS OF THIS THIS IS JUST LIKE ANOTHER AS YOU SAID BEFORE REALITY T._V. SHOW AND [SIGH] IT'S PROBABLY LIKE THE PRECURSOR TO ALL OF THESE REALITY T._V. TYPE SHOWS  (fe_03_06514-A-0043)
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY MORE REAL THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT GETS PUT ON  (fe_03_06514-A-0044)
BUT I I JUST YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT  (fe_03_06514-A-0045)
[LIPSMACK] THAT PEOPLE WILL GET FAIR TRIALS I ALSO THINK IT LEAVES OPEN UM A LOT MORE FOR APPEAL  (fe_03_06514-A-0046)
AFTER THE VERDICTS HAVE COME DOWN AND THAT ALSO CAN BE USED BECAUSE PUBLIC OPINION CAN BE USED BASED ON THE RESPONSE OF THE TELEVISED TRIAL  (fe_03_06514-A-0047)
AND AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY DILUTING OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM NOW THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06514-A-0048)
[LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW AND AND HONESTLY I REALLY HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE THIS  (fe_03_06514-A-0049)
SO BUT YEAH I I THINK IT PROBABLY DOES SERVE TO DILUTE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MAYBE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS [SIGH] YOU KNOW WHERE  (fe_03_06514-A-0050)
WE HAVE JUDGES AND AND ATTORNEYS WHO WANT TO GO ON AND THIS CAN BE A FORUM FOR THEM  (fe_03_06514-A-0051)

YEAH DO YOU THINK T._V. IS IS ALLOWS THAT  (fe_03_06514-A-0057)
TO HAPPEN BETTER OR OR FACILITATES IT IN ANY WAY  (fe_03_06514-A-0058)

[MN] IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT THE VERDICT WAS GONNA BE EVEN BEFORE IT WAS READ  (fe_03_06514-B-0016)
AND THAT WAS JUST BASED ON YOU KNOW PUBLIC OPINION SO I DO THINK  (fe_03_06514-B-0017)
IN A WAY YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S I DUNNO I I THINK IT WAS UM  (fe_03_06514-B-0018)
I DON'T WANNA SAY FIXED BUT I DO THINK UM PUBLIC OPINION HAD  (fe_03_06514-B-0019)

BUT THAT OF COURSE I MEAN M- MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ALREADY THINK HE'S GUILTY SO [NOISE] I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD  (fe_03_06514-B-0032)
MAKE A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF IT AL- IF IT IS TELEVISED OR NOT BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE AGAIN HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND  (fe_03_06514-B-0033)
