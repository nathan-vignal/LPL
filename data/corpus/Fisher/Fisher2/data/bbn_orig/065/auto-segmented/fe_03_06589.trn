IT HAS I AND THE DIVORCE RATE HAS NOT ALTERED MY BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE  (fe_03_06589-A-0021)
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ERRATIC BEHAVIOUR AS FAR AS RELATIONSHIPS GO I LIKE TO SEW I'M VERY LOYAL I AM  (fe_03_06589-A-0022)
FOR TEN YEARS AND I WOULD NEVER LOOK AT ANOTHER MAN I  (fe_03_06589-A-0023)

AND IF WE CAME TO A POINT WHERE WE DISAGREED ON MARRIAGE THEN  (fe_03_06589-A-0025)
I THINK IT WOULD BE AMICABLE  (fe_03_06589-A-0026)
AND WE'D JUST GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS AND START A NEW RELATIONSHIP BUT I THINK PEOPLE JUST MISUSE MARRIAGE ALTOGETHER  (fe_03_06589-A-0027)
ESPECIALLY CELEBRITIES I MEAN HOW MANY TIMES HAS LIZ TAYLOR BEEN MARRIED  (fe_03_06589-A-0028)

WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EVERYTHING THAT THEY WANT SO EVEN IF THEY ARE MARRIED THEY'RE NOT AFRAID TO GO OUTSIDE THEIR MARRIAGE AND DO WHAT THEY FEEL IS RIGHT WHICH YOU KNOW IT IS  (fe_03_06589-A-0037)
IT IS THE ULTIMATE SELFISHNESS I FEEL  (fe_03_06589-A-0038)

IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO REPEAT ITSELF HISTORY WILL ALWAYS REPEAT ITSELF  (fe_03_06589-A-0040)
BUT WE CAN STOP THE DIVORCE RATE IF WE JUST LOOK WITHIN OURSELVES AND SAY WELL DO I REALLY WANT THAT OTHER PERSON ARE THEY REALLY GOING TO MAKE ME HAPPY WE HAVE TO MAKE OURSELVES HAPPY BEFORE WE CAN  (fe_03_06589-A-0041)
MAKE SOMEONE ELSE HAPPY I FEEL  (fe_03_06589-A-0042)

UH PEOPLE JUST DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUS ENOUGH I THINK BECAUSE THEY ARE LOOKING AT CELEBRITIES AND OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY THINK WELL I WANT WHAT LIZ TAYLOR HAS I WANT TO GET MARRIED EIGHT TIMES BUT SHE DID GET MARRIED EIGHT TIMES BUT IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT  (fe_03_06589-A-0058)

'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO AWAY ON MISSIONS AND THEN  (fe_03_06589-A-0092)
