THAT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHANGE IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT NEEDS TO SHOW THAT THINGS THAT HAVE EVOLVED FROM WHAT WAS ONCE DONE WRONG TO WHAT'S NOW INSTEAD OF JUST TAKING IT OUT THAT'S MY OPINION ON THAT  (fe_03_06598-A-0048)
AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE WERE TOTALLY APPALLED AT THAT WE HAVE TO LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES  (fe_03_06598-A-0049)
IF THEY'RE NEVER PUT IN THERE THE MISTAKES WE MADE AS A COUNTRY AND AS A WORLD THE KIDS WILL NOT KNOW ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06598-A-0050)

HI ANNE IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU  (fe_03_06598-B-0002)
UM AS FAR AS THE TOPIC I DO NOT REALLY BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE THE RIGHT TO ISSUE CENSORSHIP HOWEVER PRIVATE SCHOOLS I REALLY FEEL LIKE THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CENSOR WHAT THEIR STUDENTS READ  (fe_03_06598-B-0003)
I AGREE  (fe_03_06598-B-0004)
I AGREE WITH THAT I I DO AGREE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN AGE LIMITS THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE ACCESS TO CERTAIN MATERIAL  (fe_03_06598-B-0005)
MY DAUGHTER DOES GO TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL SO IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ANSWER THAT I MEAN WHEN I ATTENDED A PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_06598-B-0006)
AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SORT OF CENSORSHIP AS FAR AS I WAS AWARE OF UM  (fe_03_06598-B-0007)
WITH MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL HOWEVER THEY DO CAUSE SHE'S JUST IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  (fe_03_06598-B-0008)
AND THERE'S NO JUNIOR HIGH AGE  (fe_03_06598-B-0009)
MATERIAL OR HIGH SCHOOL AGE MATERIAL AVAILABLE TO HER BUT THEY DO SORT OF CENSOR THE TYPES OF BOOKS THAT THAT COME INTO THERE THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO READ BUT FOR FOR THE REASON THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR HER TO BE THERE IS  (fe_03_06598-B-0010)
THE REASON THAT WE DO WANT THEM TO WATCH OUT WHAT THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON  (fe_03_06598-B-0011)
AND I AS FAR AS PUBLIC SCHOOLS HOWEVER I  (fe_03_06598-B-0012)
I AGREE WITH YOU THEY DO NEED TO BE AGE APPROPRIATE MATERIAL BUT  (fe_03_06598-B-0013)
HOW THEY GO ABOUT DOING THAT I JUST REALLY DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06598-B-0014)
YEAH  (fe_03_06598-B-0015)
YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT I  (fe_03_06598-B-0016)
UM I DON'T LIKE BOOK BANNING AND I DON'T LIKE BOOK BURNINGS AND THAT SORT OF THING MYSELF I BUT I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS SOME THINGS THAT JUST SHOULD NOT BE IN A SCHOOL LIBRARY  (fe_03_06598-B-0017)
UM AND YOU KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY THE REASON RIGHT NOW IN THE AREA THAT I'M LIVING IN WE'RE IN TEXAS AND  (fe_03_06598-B-0018)
RIGHT NOW IN THE TOWN THAT I'M LIVING IN I DON'T AGREE WITH THE WAY THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BEING RUN HERE  (fe_03_06598-B-0019)
YES  (fe_03_06598-B-0020)
YES I DID I SAW THAT  (fe_03_06598-B-0021)
UM ACTUALLY THE TOWN I'M IN WE HOLD THEY HOLD SPELLING BEE'S THAT GO TO THE NATIONAL SPELLING BEE'S AND FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS THE PERSON THE KIDS THAT HAVE WON THE SPELLING BEE'S HAVE BEEN HOME SCHOOL KIDS  (fe_03_06598-B-0022)
AND WE HAVE A FRIEND WHO HOME SCHOOLS AND SAYS MY DAUGHTER GOES HER PRIVATE SCHOOL IS VERY SMALL  (fe_03_06598-B-0023)
SO SHE GETS INTO A LOT OF AND SPORTS ACTIVITIES FROM FROM CHURCHES AND THE CHURCH WHERE SHE GOES TO PLAY BASKETBALL THEY ACTUALLY HAVE UM  (fe_03_06598-B-0024)
ONE MAN AND HIS WIFE THAT RUNS A PROGRAM OF HOME SCHOOLERS AND MOST OF THE KIDS THAT SHE PLAYS BASKETBALL WITH ARE HOME SCHOOL CHILDREN  (fe_03_06598-B-0025)
SO HOME SCHOOLING HAS BECOME QUITE POPULAR AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST TIRED OF NOT HAVING MORE OF A SAY IN THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION  (fe_03_06598-B-0026)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06598-B-0027)
