THERE'S A THERE'S A TOPIC CALLED REGULAR EXPRESSIONS  (fe_03_06592-B-0066)
WHERE LIKE IT'S SORT OF PATTERNS OF TEXT AND USING PEARL ESPECIALLY IS REALLY STRONG WITH WORKING WITH THOSE KIND OF THINGS BUT THERE'S A WHOLE THEORETICAL BACKGROUND THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE INTERESTING AND IT'S ALSO USEFUL GENERALLY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE  (fe_03_06592-B-0067)
SO I THOUGHT IT'D BE AN INTERESTING TOPIC TO GET INTO WHETHER I DO IT PROFESSIONALLY OR NOT 'CAUSE I MIGHT AS WELL ENJOY IT  (fe_03_06592-B-0068)

WITH COMPUTERS IT'S LIKE LEARNING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE USING IT FOR SIX MONTHS AND THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO USE IT ANYMORE  (fe_03_06592-B-0072)
AND HAVING TO LEARN A DIFFERENT ONE AND TH- TH- THE PATTERNS THEY THEY PUT TOGETHER ARE VERY ARBITRARY  (fe_03_06592-B-0073)

WHAT THE WHOLE THING IS AND I ASSUME WHATEVER WE SAY IS BEING RECORDED I MEAN IT HAS TO BE RECORDED 'CAUSE THEY'RE STUDYING THIS  (fe_03_06592-B-0086)
BUT IT'S LINGUISTICS AND NOT PSYCHOLOGY  (fe_03_06592-B-0087)
