GO INTO MARRIAGE  (fe_03_06559-A-0028)
UM WITH THE IDEA THAT  (fe_03_06559-A-0029)
I MEAN I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE GO INTO MARRIAGE THINKING THAT  (fe_03_06559-A-0030)
THIS IS A DECISION THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TAKEN SO SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I CAN ALWAYS END IT IF IT IF THERE'S A PROBLEM  (fe_03_06559-A-0031)
AND SO THEY'RE SO QUICK TO TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT INSTEAD OF WORKING THROUGH THE PROBLEMS RIGHT  (fe_03_06559-A-0032)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06559-A-0033)
AND I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_06559-A-0034)
[MN] BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN EASY DECISION TO MAKE IT'S SO IT'S SO EASY TO GET DIVORCED  (fe_03_06559-A-0035)
THAT UM IT JUST MAKES IT  (fe_03_06559-A-0036)
I MEAN THE DIVORCE RATE IS LIKE ALMOST FIFTY PER CENT IN SOME AREAS  (fe_03_06559-A-0037)

YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BEST PIECES OF ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU IS TO LOOK AT M- AT DIVORCE AS NOT AN OPTION UNLESS  (fe_03_06559-A-0040)
THERE IS SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL OR  (fe_03_06559-A-0041)
OTHER ABUSE GOING ON  (fe_03_06559-A-0042)
YOU KNOW I MEAN IT  (fe_03_06559-A-0043)

RIGHT AND THERE'S SO MANY OTHER BETTER DECISIONS YOU CAN MAKE FOR THAT BABY THAN JUST NECESSARILY GET GET MARRIED AND ACTUALLY MY LITTLE BROTHER  (fe_03_06559-A-0057)
UM WAS DATING THIS GIRL AND [MN] IT TURNS OUT TO BE A HUGE COMPLICATED STORY BUT ANYWAY  (fe_03_06559-A-0058)

UM THAT FOLLOWED IN ORDER TO TRY AND STILL GET HIM TO MARRY HER AND IN F- IF SHE AND SHE TURNS OUT TO HAVE BIG TIME MENTAL PROBLEMS AND IT WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN THE WORST DECISION OF HIS LIFE IF HE HAD SUCCUMBED TO THAT AND MARRIED HER BECAUSE OF THAT  (fe_03_06559-A-0063)

BUT I JUST THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_06559-A-0078)
PEOPLE  (fe_03_06559-A-0079)
I I THINK THAT STRONG FAMILY VALUES ARE IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK AT MARRIAGE AS A VERY INVOLVED AND DETAILED DECISION THAT YOU DON'T TAKE LIGHTLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD UM  (fe_03_06559-A-0080)
I THINK FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE ARE NOT GETTING MARRIED BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED OF IT BECAUSE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT END UP BEING DIVORCED OR THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IT'S TOO MUCH OF A DECISION TO MAKE  (fe_03_06559-A-0081)
AND NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES ARE JUST LIVING THEY'RE JUST CHOOSING TO LIVE TOGETHER AND RAISE FAMILIES THAT WAY BECAUSE  (fe_03_06559-A-0082)
THEY'RE AFRAID OF MARRIAGE AND I THINK  (fe_03_06559-A-0083)
I THINK THAT MARRIAGE CAN BE THE MOST FREEING THING BECAUSE YOU KNO- YOU ARE SECURE YOU REALIZE THAT THIS PERSON WANTS TO BE WITH YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE OR AT LEAST  (fe_03_06559-A-0084)
AND SO IN THAT RESPECT IT'S  (fe_03_06559-A-0085)
IT'S A SCARY DECISION BUT IT'S ALSO THE BEST DECISION  (fe_03_06559-A-0086)

YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT THEY RESPECT THE DECISION THE THE CONSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE ENOUGH TO BE SCARED  (fe_03_06559-A-0090)
ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME FIRST YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN TO TAKE THE TIME AND DECIDE IF THEY REALLY ARE UP FOR THAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06559-A-0091)

TO START OUT RIGHT AND UM [SIGH] YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT BEFORE YOU GET MARRIED THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW  (fe_03_06559-A-0096)
