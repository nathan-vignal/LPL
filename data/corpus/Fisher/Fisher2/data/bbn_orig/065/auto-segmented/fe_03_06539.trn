UPSTATE NEW YORK  (fe_03_06539-A-0003)
YOU'RE PROBABLY THE CLOSEST CALL I'VE HAD  (fe_03_06539-A-0004)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06539-A-0005)
UM THIS IS MY FOURTH SO  (fe_03_06539-A-0006)
DRUG TESTING YEAH  (fe_03_06539-A-0007)
I DON'T EITHER  (fe_03_06539-A-0008)
YEAH AH YOU KNOW I AGREE UM I DON'T THINK MOST COMPANIES ARE GOING TO DO THAT UNLESS THERE'S  (fe_03_06539-A-0009)
S- SOME YOU KNOW SAFETY REASON THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THAT ANYWAY I MEAN IF IT'S UH YOUR SAFETY OR THE SAFETY OR OF THE OF OTHER PEOPLE OR THE SAFETY OF YOU KNOW MACHINES WHERE YOU'RE WORKING ON  (fe_03_06539-A-0010)
SO IT JUST MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME AND I MEAN FAR AS I'M CONCERNED YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT ANYWAY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06539-A-0011)
YOU KNOW YEAH REALLY  (fe_03_06539-A-0012)

I DIDN'T KNOW THAT  (fe_03_06539-A-0014)
YEAH  (fe_03_06539-A-0015)
YOU KNOW IT IT DOES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE AS YOU SAY IF SOMEBODY'S CUTTING WOOD AND THEY'RE USING UM SOME KIND OF A SAW AND THEY'RE ON DRUGS AND THEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND THEY HURT EITHER THEMSELVES OR SOMEBODY ELSE  (fe_03_06539-A-0016)
WHO'S GOING TO GET SUED EVERYBODY INCLUDING HOME DEPOT WHETHER IT'S THEIR FAULT OR NOT  (fe_03_06539-A-0017)
AND I MEAN THEY'RE JUST PRETTY MUCH TRYING TO GUARD THEMSELVES AGAINST THAT HAPPENING SO YOU YOU CAN'T BLAME 'EM IT'S CHEAPER FOR THEM TO DRUG TEST THEIR EMPLOYEES  (fe_03_06539-A-0018)
THAN TO HAVE SOME KIND OF LAW SUIT OR SOMEBODY DIE OR  (fe_03_06539-A-0019)
MHM  (fe_03_06539-A-0021)
YEAH  (fe_03_06539-A-0022)
WELL I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO  (fe_03_06539-A-0023)
YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE RESULTS OR  (fe_03_06539-A-0024)
YOU KNOW I THINK [SIGH] [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_06539-A-0025)
I THINK ALL THEY CAN REPORT  (fe_03_06539-A-0026)
I- IF THEY DO LIKE A FIVE PANEL DRUG SCREEN I THINK ALL THEY CAN REPORT IS THOSE FIVE PANELS AND IF YOU PA- IF YOU TEST NEGATIVE FOR THOSE FIVE THINGS YOU KNOW AND A- UM A- BARBITURATES AMPHETAMINES POT AND THERE'S TWO OTHERS UM I THINK  (fe_03_06539-A-0027)
I THINK THAT'S ALL THEY CAN REPORT I DON'T THINK THEY CAN REPORT ANYTHING ELSE BUT I DON'T KNOW THINGS COULD BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT STATES I'M REALLY NOT SURE  (fe_03_06539-A-0028)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_06539-A-0029)
SURE  (fe_03_06539-A-0031)
AND THAT'S A A REAL LEGITIMATE CONCERN ACTUALLY I WORKED IN HUMAN RESOURCES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I HAD A YOUNG PERSON WHO TESTED POSITIVE W- I WORKED IN A HOSPITAL  (fe_03_06539-A-0032)
AND HE TESTED POSITIVE FOR POT AND THAT'S WHAT HE WAS CLAIMING THAT HE WAS SOME PLACE THAT THEY WERE SMOKING BUT HE WASN'T DOING IT WELL THE HOSPITAL DIDN'T ACCEPT THE OUT- THE UM THAT EXPLANATION AND HE WAS NOT HIRED  (fe_03_06539-A-0033)
UM [MN] YOU KNOW HE W- HE WAS OF AGE SO THAT HE COULD BE TESTED BUT WHEN HE WASN'T HIRED  (fe_03_06539-A-0034)
HE DIDN'T TELL HIS PARENTS WHY AND HIS PARENTS CALLED THE HOSPITAL AND YOU KNOW WE HAD TO WORK OUT YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU TELL THE PARENTS YOU KNOW WHAT  (fe_03_06539-A-0035)
WHAT SHOULD HE BE TELLING THEM AND I MEAN IT REALLY WASN'T US TO TELL THE PARENT ANYTHING 'CAUSE IT WAS CONF- CONFIDENTIAL BETWEEN US AND THE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEE  (fe_03_06539-A-0036)
SO IT IT OPENS A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU YOU DON'T REALLY EXPECT  (fe_03_06539-A-0037)
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES SHOW UP YOU KNOW THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT DOES SECOND HAND MARIJUANA SMOKE SHOW UP AND TO WHAT DEGREE  (fe_03_06539-A-0038)
HUH  (fe_03_06539-A-0039)

ATE UM POPPY SEED BAGELS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE S- HAVE SAID NO THAT'S A LE- THAT'S AN URBAN LEGEND THAT'S NOT REALLY TRUE  (fe_03_06539-A-0048)
BUT IT IS TRUE AND HE I MEAN WHEN HE EATS HE EATS A LOT AND HE DID TEST POSITIVE BUT THEY GAVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND THEY WENT BACK AND THEY DID A TEST LIKE ANOTHER DAY LATER OR TWO DAYS LATER AND HE WAS FINE BY THAT TIME BUT  (fe_03_06539-A-0049)
