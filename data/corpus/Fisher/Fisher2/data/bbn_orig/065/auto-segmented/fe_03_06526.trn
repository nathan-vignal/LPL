I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THAT SINCE DRUGS AFFECT AN EMPLOYEE'S PERFORMANCE  (fe_03_06526-A-0012)
THAT JUST AS AN EMPLOYER HAS UH CAN UTILIZE ANY OTHER ASSESSMENTS TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS A GOOD EMPLOYEE THAT THIS IS ANOTHER ASSESSMENT THEY CAN USE TO SEE IF THIS IS AN EMPLOYEE WORTH KEEPING OR NOT  (fe_03_06526-A-0013)

[LIPSMACK] 'CAUSE SOME UH SOME YOU KNOW LIKE WITH AN AIRLINE IT'S REQUIRED BUT UM WITH OTHER BUSINESS IT'S IT MAYBE JUST A MATTER OF  (fe_03_06526-A-0056)
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE AND THEY MAY DRUG TEST DIFFERENT CLASSES OF EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW THEY MAY ASSUME THAT ANYBODY MAKING OVER YOU KNOW WHICH IS UN- UN-  (fe_03_06526-A-0057)
HI MY NAME IS JACKIE  (fe_03_06526-B-0001)
YEAH UM IT SAID THAT IN BUSINESSES DO YOU AGREE WITH THE FACT ABOUT THE TESTING FOR DRUGS DO YOU THINK IT'S A FAIR PRACTICE OR DO YOU THINK IT'S NOT A FAIR PRACTICE  (fe_03_06526-B-0002)
THAT'S WHAT I UH THEY SAY IT'S ALL FAIR SO  (fe_03_06526-B-0003)
YES  (fe_03_06526-B-0004)
OH YEAH YEAH I THINK IT'S FAIR TOO SO I'LL LET YOU YOU WANT TO TALK FOR A WHILE  (fe_03_06526-B-0005)
OKAY  (fe_03_06526-B-0006)
YEAH WE WE JUST TALK ABOUT IT UM UH THIS IS MY THIS IS MY THIRD CONVERSATION YOU KNOW SO I KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO SAY FIRST A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN YOU COULD OKAY  (fe_03_06526-B-0007)
YEAH I BELIEVE THAT IT'S A FAIR THING BECAUSE I MEAN IF THE COMPANY'S PAYING ALL THIS MONEY  (fe_03_06526-B-0008)
TO THE EMPLOYEE I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEE IF THEIR EMPLOYEE IS YOU KNOW HIGH ON DRUGS IF THE PERSON IS HIGH ON DRUGS WHILE THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB THERE COULD BE VERY BAD COMPLICATIONS  (fe_03_06526-B-0009)
AS FAR AS UM THEY COULD PROBABLY FALL ASLEEP  (fe_03_06526-B-0010)
UM THEY MAY NOT BE DOING THEIR WORK WITH HIGH PRODUCTIVITY  (fe_03_06526-B-0011)
AND ALSO UM YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY CAN DO IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE HIGH ON DRUGS MAYBE THEY CAN STEAL FROM A COWORKER  (fe_03_06526-B-0012)
LOOK IN A COWORKER'S PURSE AND SAY WELL TH- UM WELL MAYBE I NEED FIVE DOLLARS FOR DRUGS SO I THINK IT'S VERY FAIR FOR THEM TO TEST FOR DRUGS AND IF THE PERSON  (fe_03_06526-B-0013)
DOES HAVE LIKE ANY KINDA DRUG IN THEIR SYSTEM  (fe_03_06526-B-0014)
UH MAYBE TRY TO GET THEM HELP OR MAYBE SUSPEND FOR THIRTY SAYS SEND THEM TO UH REHABILITATION  (fe_03_06526-B-0015)
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T LOSE THEIR JOB RIGHT AWAY BUT IT THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF I WAS SOMEBODY THE HEAD OF A COMPANY I WOULD I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY WORKING FOR ME THAT'S HIGH ON DRUGS I WOULD BE YOU KNOW SCARED OF THAT PERSON I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO  (fe_03_06526-B-0016)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_06526-B-0017)
DEFINITELY  (fe_03_06526-B-0018)
RIGHT I AGREE WITH YOU VERY MUCH AND I DON'T THINK IT'S AN INVASION OF PRIVACY AT ALL BECAUSE  (fe_03_06526-B-0019)
AFTER ALL THE COMPANY IS PAYING THE PERSON QUITE A LOT OF MONEY AND ALSO THEY GET MEDICAL BENEFITS  (fe_03_06526-B-0020)
NOW LET'S SAY THE PERSON IS ON DRUGS AND THEY'RE SICK A LOT  (fe_03_06526-B-0021)
I MEAN THEY'RE PAYING THE MEDICAL BENEFIT FOR THAT PERSON  (fe_03_06526-B-0022)
THEY WERE ALSO LOSING YOU KNOW TIME AND DAYS YOU KNOW 'CAUSE WHEN PEOPLE GET HIGH THEY MAY CALL UP IF THEY GET HIGH ON A WEEKEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY MAY CALL UP ON A MONDAY AND WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR DRUG BINGE OR WHATEVER IT BE ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_06526-B-0023)
AND THEN THEY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABSENT AND THAT'S GONNA AFFECT THE OTHER COWORKERS TOO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP THE SLACK OF THE NEXT PERSON AND DO A LOT MORE WORK  (fe_03_06526-B-0024)
SO YEAH I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S A VERY ENCOURAGING THING FOR THEM TO TEST FOR DRUGS AND I DON'T KNOW WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AGAINST THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY  (fe_03_06526-B-0025)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0026)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0027)
RIGHT I AGREE WITH YOU THE ONLY THING I'M A LITTLE BIT AGAINST I'M B- I'M HAPPY IF THEY WOULD TEST FOR DRUGS LIKE COCAINE MARIJUANA AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT IF THEY TEST A PERSON'S BLOOD LET'S SAY THE PERSON HAS A ASTHMA  (fe_03_06526-B-0028)
PROBLEM AND THEY TAKE SOME KIND OF ASTHMA PILLS OR MAYBE ANEMIA YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0029)
TO TEST FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE BLOOD I THINK THEY SHOULD LOOK FOR SPECIFIC DRUGS THAT WOULD AFFECT YOU KNOW THE COMPANY POLICY WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS LET'S SAY A PERSON HAS ANEMIA  (fe_03_06526-B-0030)
AND THEY TEST THE PERSON'S BLOOD YOU KNOW AND THE PERSON COMES OUT WITH A PILL THAT THEY'RE TAKING TO MAKE THEIR BLOOD PLATELETS STRONGER OR SOMETHING FOR ANEMIA  (fe_03_06526-B-0031)
AND THEN THEY HAVE THAT ON THE MEDICAL MEDICAL RECORD IN THE COMPANY RIGHT THEN WHAT IF THEY SAY WELL I DON'T KNOW IF I REALLY WANT TO KEEP THIS EMPLOYEE MAYBE SHE'S GONNA BE SLUGGISH BEING THAT SHE HAS LIKE ANEMIA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06526-B-0032)
SO LIKE I THOUGHT MAYBE IT SHOULD BE LIKE A SPECIFIC YOU KNOW UM A NUMEROUS AMOUNT OF SPECIFIC LIKE DRUGS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MAYBE TEN TYPE OF DRUGS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_06526-B-0033)
RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0034)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0035)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0036)
WELL YEAH I AGREE WITH  (fe_03_06526-B-0037)
RIGHT I AGREE WITH YOU 'CAUSE CAN YOU IMAGINE IF SOMEONE HAS AN ILLNESS ANY TYPE OF SLIGHT ILLNESS  (fe_03_06526-B-0038)
AND THEY DO TAKE A A PILL FOR THAT AND IT COMES OUT IN THE BLOOD TEST AND THEN THEY'RE LIKE WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I LIKE YOU KNOW I LIKE THIS PERSON TAKING THIS THING  (fe_03_06526-B-0039)
YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S GONNA AFFECT THE UH THE BENEFITS I  (fe_03_06526-B-0040)
I PAY LIKE IF THE PERSON HAS ANEMIA SOMETHING LIKE SIX MONTHS FROM NOW THEN I HAVE TO PAY LIKE MORE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S LIKE A SMALL COMPANY OH I MIGHT HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF MEDICAL BENEFITS IF THAT PERSON IS OUT FOR TWO WEEKS SO THAT'S WHEN THAT'S WHEN IT GETS LIKE  (fe_03_06526-B-0041)
S- KINDA HAIRY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06526-B-0042)
THAT THAT'S WHERE I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM SO  (fe_03_06526-B-0043)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0044)
YES I DO  (fe_03_06526-B-0045)
RIGHT DEFINITELY  (fe_03_06526-B-0046)
RIGHT DEFINITELY  (fe_03_06526-B-0047)
[NOISE] RIGHT DEFINITELY DEFINITELY BECAUSE THAT'S PERSONAL IF SOMEONE HAS I MEAN EVERYONE IN THE WORLD MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE HEALTH PROBLEM SOMETHING MINOR AND THEY MAY TAKE A PILL FOR THAT  (fe_03_06526-B-0048)
AND THEN IF THAT COMES UP YOU KNOW THEY THEY MAY REACH A CONCLUSION WHERE THEY SAY WELL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS PERSON YOU KNOW HAS THIS ILLNESS MEANWHILE THEY'RE TAKING THE PILL FOR A DIFFERENT ILLNESS TOO  (fe_03_06526-B-0049)
BECAUSE THERE'S VARIOUS DRUGS NOWADAYS THAT TREAT VARIOUS AILMENTS AND UM THEY CAN RUN TO THE WRONG CONCLUSION I MEAN SOMEONE COULD BE TAKING SOMETHING FOR ANEMIA AND SOMEONE COULD BE TAKING SOMETHING FOR MAYBE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH INFLAMMATION IN THEIR  (fe_03_06526-B-0050)
TOE I MEAN YOU KNOW JUST AN EXAMPLE WE DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06526-B-0051)
AND IF THEY'RE THEY'RE JUMPING TO THE WRONG CONCLUSION THERE COULD BE BIG PROBLEMS SO I DON'T KNOW IF UM  (fe_03_06526-B-0052)
YOU KNOW I THINK MAYBE IF THEY DO TEST FOR DRUGS IT HAS TO BE A SPECIFIC PAPER THE PERSON SIGNS AND MAYBE JUST A LIST OF FIVE OR TEN DRUGS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE ANY ANY MORE THAN FIVE OR TEN DRUGS  (fe_03_06526-B-0053)
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ILLEGAL MAYBE THERE IS I'M NOT TOO SURE BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIFIC GUIDELINE FOR THAT  (fe_03_06526-B-0054)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06526-B-0055)
RIGHT RIGHT AND THEN CAN YOU IMAGINE A PERSON GOT THEIR TOOTH PULLED  (fe_03_06526-B-0056)
AND YOU KNOW HOW THE DENTIST GIVES YOU CODEINE NUMBER THREE BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE YOU KNOW THE OR OR ANY ANY TYPE OF THING THEY GIVE YOU A PAIN KILLER MAYBE CODEINE NUMBER THREE THAT HAS COCAINE IN IT BUT THAT'S PRESCRIBED BY A DENTIST  (fe_03_06526-B-0057)
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE YOU IF THAT COMES OUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY JUST SAYS OKAY AFTER YOU WERE THERE SIX YEARS AND THEY QUICKLY GIVE YOU A DRUG TEST THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE YOU YOU TOOK CODEINE NUMBER THREE YOU GOT YOUR TOOTH PULLED THEY'RE GOING TO SAY OH MY GOODNESS THIS PERSON TOOK COCAINE  (fe_03_06526-B-0058)
YES MY EMPLOYER DID THE ONE I I THE PER- THE PREVIOUS ONE I WAS DID YEAH I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS IN THIS PREVIOUS COMPANY  (fe_03_06526-B-0059)
AND ON THE THIRD YEAR THEY CAME OUT WITH THAT AND THEY DID DO THAT AND I DON'T THINK TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE UPSET HOW ABOUT YOUR COMPANY  (fe_03_06526-B-0060)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0061)
RIGHT RIGHT BECAUSE SOME O- SOME OF THEM DON'T YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THEM DO  (fe_03_06526-B-0062)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06526-B-0063)
