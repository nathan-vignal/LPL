BUT AS FAR AS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE USING I I REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT THE EMPLOYERS WANT TO KNOW SO THAT'S WHY THEY YOU KNOW DO THE TESTING MHM  (fe_03_06529-B-0030)
YES THERE ARE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT MORE PEOPLE YOU KNOW TO UM  (fe_03_06529-B-0031)
TO WHO YOU KNOW THERE'S MAYBE ONE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT WANTS TO AND DOES AND THERE'S ANOTHER THAT DOESN'T AND THEY JUST WANT TO WEED OUT THE PEOPLE AND LET YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU WANT TO WORK FOR THEM THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TOLERATE IT IF YOU DO DRUGS  (fe_03_06529-B-0032)

YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE WILL UH GET OTHER PEOPLE'S URINE SAMPLES TO USE YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW YEAH BUT UM  (fe_03_06529-B-0036)

BUT THEY CAN ALSO TEST IT FROM YOUR BLOOD SO  (fe_03_06529-B-0039)
BUT I THINK THAT THEY'D YOU KNOW LIKE IF UM COMPANY DOES IT AND THEN THEY RANDOMLY YOU KNOW JUST COME IN AND YOU KNOW JUST SAY HEY WE'RE HAVING A DRUG TEST TODAY THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYBODY ELSE'S YOU KNOW THEN THEY WOULD BE CAUGHT YOU KNOW SO  (fe_03_06529-B-0040)

YOU KNOW ILLEGAL DRUGS SO  (fe_03_06529-B-0068)

BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY SAYS OKAY TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE DRUG TESTED AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW BEFOREHAND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT OR GET SOMEONE ELSE'S URINE OR WHATEVER SO  (fe_03_06529-B-0073)
I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06529-B-0074)

OF THE TYPE SOCIETY THAT IT'S YOU KNOW USES DRUGS SO FREELY SO  (fe_03_06529-B-0083)
I THINK IT'S GOOD  (fe_03_06529-B-0084)
NO  (fe_03_06529-B-0085)
IF THEY UM TAKE IT FROM YOUR BLOOD THEN YOU'D HAVE JUST A LITTLE STICK TO GET THE BLOOD BUT FROM A URINE SAMPLE YOU JUST YOU KNOW GO DO IT IN A CUP AND THEN THEY TEST IT  (fe_03_06529-B-0086)
