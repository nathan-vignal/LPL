R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well that was fast. 
L:  Yeah.  My name is Marta.  I live in Charlestown, West Virginia.
R:  Oh, my name Ria, I live in Boston. 
L:  Ria? 
R:  Yep. 
L:  Oh, that's a neat name.  I know another Ria.
R:  You do? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah like Ria [inaudible] you know from the old show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah [inaudible].
L:  [inaudible] It's funny.
R:  Yeah so, um, as far as they said it was on family values.
L:  The increase of --
R:  In divorce rate.
L:  -- divorce rate.
R:  Well I've been married for almost eleven years.  Are you married? 
L:  Um, not presently.
R:  Not presently yeah.  How do you feel about it? 
L:  Um, well I guess I hadn't realised that the increase was still increasing, like I guess that I had, um, maybe, um, [inaudible] hoped that it had slowed down -- I know that when I was -- I don't know how old you are.  I'm forty four.
R:  Oh, I'm thirty nine.
L:  Yeah and I know that, um, late sixties early seventies it was really escalating really getting up there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I had hoped that we had reached a point where people were thinking a little more hard about the decision.  A little more carefully about the decision to married, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know before they actually did so, but if the divorce rate is still increasing then perhaps they are -- they are not.
R:  They're just sort of jumping into it without kind of considering.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  That they might be divorced before -- before long.
L:  Right.  I mean I don't advocate you know living together necessarily.
R:  Yeah me neither.
L:  Especially before you get married I think that -- I think anyway for the woman it often turns out a mistake.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Um, but I think that -- I think it's something that you can't jump into very bluntly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know a lot of people I think that because divorce is [inaudible] I think people think well you know so what if I make a mistake hey I'm not saddled with it forever.
R:  I guess -- I agree with you -- I mean the like [inaudible] people I can't even talk.  People do jump into it pretty fast thinking it's just another kind of break up like --
L:  Right exactly -- exactly you're right.
R:  [inaudible] I think what bothers me the most is that it's one thing if you break up and even if you get divorced and everything but when you have children involved I think that breaks my heart and --
L:  Yeah because they -- they feel so responsible.
R:  They do and it screws them up for like -- like my father came from divorced parents and it -- I think it was a life long you know just feeling of self blame for him.
L:  Hm.
R:  And, um, you know this is when people didn't get divorced this is a long time ago but you know it was just like to be the divorced kid on the block was so uncool and, um, -- but his parents just -- they and they separated when he was pretty young too so he sort of became the little man of the house.
L:  Right.
R:  And it put so much pressure on him and I don't know I think it was just -- I think these kids pay the price more than anything else.
L:  You know and you bring up another really excellent point.  I think back in that day and age.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know divorce -- divorce was a dirty word.
R:  Hm. 
L:  And I think there was this stigma attached with it.
R:  Definitely.
L:  You know of course not I am not originally from West Virginia.  I've only -- I've lived here for the past twenty years or so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm from [inaudible]
R:  Oh. 
L:  [COUGH] And you being in Boston --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Most of the areas where there's a large Catholic population.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know if you were called Catholic Church really, really frowned upon divorce.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And so there was you know it was something where you know generally the family urged, you know a couple to really try and work things through.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And I just think that you just -- you don't see that anymore, I think people just say well if you're unhappy you don't have to stay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um. 
R:  And that's really unfortunate.
L:  The whole whether I was thinking when you were talking about the kids and stuff.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You know the other thing that has happened in our society I think as a result of all of these divorces is --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- the whole concept of the nuclear family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where people are now getting remarried --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- with children from lots of marriages.
R:  Oh, man what a mess that is.
L:  Yeah I think it is -- I think you're right.
R:  I mean I hate to say but it's just like -- I know some many families where it's just you know -- you know the parents -- the parents break up they start a new family and the kids -- I mean they have all of these half sisters --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and half step brothers and step sisters and it's like how to you keep it up straight and --
L:  Exactly. 
R:  Where as you know the parental [inaudible] and you know they're split and it just it's so casual -- it's just like I mean it's as if the parents never grew up you know and they just -- they're just dating like as if they're teenager's again and they just have all these kids -- it's -- I don't know.  I don't agree with it so --
L:  You hit the nail on the head with the word casual.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think they just -- you're right I think if you divorce it's another form of break up.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And, um, you know the attitude that our society has taken with divorce is a whole lot [inaudible] has become very casual.
R:  And the woman really does -- I mean besides -- I mean of course like the kids I think like pay the biggest price but financially I think the woman pays like a really huge financial price when -- because her standards of living I think typically goes down and the man's general living goes up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And cause it's usually the mother who either has a lesser paying job or has been a homemaker.  I mean I'm a homemaker and if I was to get divorced I mean I'd find a way to get a job and support my son and everything but it would be a big difference and lifestyle.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And, um, there's no way I'd -- I'd be living the way I live right now.
L:  Yeah you're right because there is -- there is a big difference between what men are paid and women are paid that's one --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  One area in which there rely is not any great deal of, uh, equality.
R:  Yeah I know I think all around it's not such a hot thing.  [LAUGH] To say the least but, um, yeah it's well um -- I don't know.
L:  [inaudible] you're right into the whole thing where really don't have the [inaudible] -- I mean it's hard really to have any [inaudible] divorce when once you have to -- to have a custody battle.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that would be really hard.
R:  I don't know how it's done it sounds terrible.
L:  I'm fortunate because I have my children, um, that was just never an issue.
R:  I'm sorry you're fortunate because what? 
L:  I have my children I have custody -- full custody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know I think that's, um, my ex rightfully so realised that in his day it was not something he was not cut out for.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And very honestly didn't fit in with his plans.
R:  Wow.
L:  His intend [LAUGH] his plans were not honorable --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but at least he was honest that much I have to give him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so you know there was never any fighting over that.
R:  Yeah that -- that's good because to put kids through that is probably so ugly.
L:  But I would -- you know I -- I think about sometimes though and I've known -- I've known men who -- who you know friends that I have who really are not that parent who really want to be part of their children's lives.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And you know there's some issue between the father and the mother and you know the mother just sticks it to the father.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he doesn't get to see the kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know so I mean I feel badly about that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think that -- I think that there are a lot of fathers and even grandparents who really get screwed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who, um, don't get the visitation that they ought to.
R:  Yeah I know grandparents it's funny you should bring that up it's like cause where do grandparents fit in all of this because they in a way they're -- they're part of their kids -- the kids life too and it's like they get cut off totally.
L:  They do.
R:  But it's sometimes -- I mean what can you do it's like if it's especially if it was a nasty situation you know it's like -- I can't imagine -- like I can't admit that I get along that well like -- I don't get along with my in laws very well to begin with so if I were to get divorced I can't imagine you know staying in touch with them to be honest with you.  They're not very nice people and, um, but I mean my husband just -- I can't believe he came from that family because they -- they're just you know -- it's --
L:  But are they good to your ch- -- to your son? 
R:  They are.  They're very good to him.
L:  You know that -- that's what matters.
R:  And they really do care about him a lot and stuff so you know it's like I -- they couldn't care less about me even though I produced him you know it is like -- it's just I'm just cast aside like the laundry.
