R:  How you doing?
L:  Pretty good.  And so um I guess we have to talk about criminal justice or, you know --
R:  Ye- yeah.  Um, I don't know, what are your thoughts on that?
L:  Well, I don't really think it should be televised.  
R:  You don't think it should be televised?
L:  No, I don't think it should be televised, 'cause I just think of what I would be thinking if it was my situation, and ah, you know, I was in court, I wouldn't want people to televise it and other people judge it without even being in there and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just being all in the media.  So, whatever would get me angry, I wouldn't it done to somebody else.  
R:  Yeah, that makes sense.  That makes sense.  I think people, uh -- I was just --
L:  I mean is, I would -- I watch it, but I feel bad, like down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, when people just go a little too far and now, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I guess carried away.  It's like, you know, bad high school gossip or something.
R:  Yeah.  I think they show too much, ah, like of the entertainment business on TV.
L:  Yes.  That -- yeah.  It -- after a certain point --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it doesn't get -- it does -- it's not fun.  'Cause if they --
R:  Yeah --
L:  It's if you're a star, you love 'em, and then the camera's always in their faces.  Sometimes they get a little aggravated and you think that's ho- who they are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but --
R:  I think people in the world nowadays are, uh, just too infatuated with, like, other people's --
L:  Lives.
R:  -- business and drama and, you know, all that stuff.
L:  Oh, that's for sure.  That's why I'm single.  
R:  What?
L:  But -- yes.  That's for sure, 'cause that's why I'm single.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because people are too interested and that --
R:  Yep.  Yep.  It's -- I don't know, like how people like will sit and like watch a fire, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  On the corner --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [LAUGH] all that.
L:  Well, being -- being -- being in New York, at least I'll give it to you that people keep on walking.  
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  'Cause nobody wants to get involved.
R:  Yep.  Yep.
L:  That's what --
R:  So, uh, so yeah.  I don't know.  Uh --
L:  But, okay, listen, let's talk about the trials, Lacey, uh, and the -- what's his face?  Richardson?
R:  What'd you say?
L:  The Richardson trial?  
R:  Ah --
L:  The married couple --
R:  -- which was one that?
L:  The one that he ha- took off the head of his wife.  
R:  Is that the one where --
L:  She was pregnant.
R:  -- she was pregnant?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Oh, that's crazy.
L:  They found -- they found her headless.
R:  That is cr- that's crazy.  I think that, uh --
L:  That is really --
R:  That -- that guy is, I don't know, he's insane or something.  
L:  Why would he do that to somebody that's pregnant with his kid?
R:  I don't even know.  I think that's crazy, how they found her in the river and the baby, like -- well, I mean, that'd just be like -- I don't even know what I'd do, you know what I'm saying?  It's -- if I saw that.  
L:  And -- and --
R:  That's just way too crazy.
L:  -- do you think it's him?
R:  Uh, I'm not sure.  I haven't really watched it too much --
L:  Well, because of the media and it's televised, you would think it's him, right?
R:  Yeah, I -- maybe.  I don't know.  I guess I haven't listened to too much of the, uh --
L:  Well, every time I turn on the news, that's one of their highlights.
R:  Oh, yeah, oh yeah.
L:  It's the update of the update, you know?  
R:  That or some crazy -- other crazy people.  There's way too many crazy people out there.

L:  And the media sure televises it.
R:  Yeah, they do.  
L:  They're the --
R:  They're always there with their cameras.
L:  Yes.  And it's interesting 'cause -- 'cause we didn't know that we had so many crazy people like that.
R:  I know.  I know.  I mean, I don't know.  It's crazy.
L:  Like, the other days on the news it was televised that this teacher, she's going to court 'cause she had sex with a sixteen year old.  In her car.
R:  Ah, a woman?  A woman teacher?
L:  Yeah.  Yes.
R:  Uh, that's just insane.
L:  And, uh, she's going to court and she's going to trial now, and that was televised and I just thought --
R:  That's crazy.
L:  -- like, why would she even do that?  Like, what --
R:  I -- I don't --
L:  -- would made you even put your pants down and do something like that?
R:  For real.  Especially with one of your students, you know what I'm saying?
L:  A sixteen year old and you're like, twenty nine, thirty.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's insane.  I don't know.  And that's the weird thing, you always hear about women teachers, like, I haven't heard of -- a lot about guy teachers, like, in the --
