R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Um.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Our topic is do you believe that schools, private or public, should have the right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to censor books; is -- is that what you heard?
L:  Yeah, I -- it -- it took a second for me to catch what they were saying, but I think that's what they said.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  So my name's Julie.
R:  My name's Carol.
L:  Hi Carol.  I live in New York.
R:  I'm in Florida.
L:  Oh.
R:  We're worlds apart.  [LAUGH]
L:  Nice and sunny down there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  Well, what do you think?
L:  I don't know.  I -- I'm kind of tossed up because in some ways I think that it limits education but if it was my kid, there's certain things, like racism and things that I wouldn't want them to learn either.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, I -- I think it has its place but it can get out of hand sometimes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, um, certainly in the younger grades I think they should be careful what they let the kids read and also like you were saying, for, um, um, what did you say about, um, racism?  Is that what you said?
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  About racism or hatred or, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Certain, um, um, nationalities.
L:  Right.
R:  Of races of people, stuff like that, um.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I don't know, sometimes it can change your whole -- whole attitude about things, you know, when you -- when you learn that young it's very hard to break it when you get older.
L:  Right, absolutely.
R:  By the time you get older you might start to realize that it's wrong, but then you're thinking well my parents think it's good, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so then you're thinking that well, it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me just like a mom or dad is a Democrat or a Republican --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Then I should be one you know, or whatever so --
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, you know, some things --
L:  When a lot of times it goes against what they've learned at home too and --
R:  Right.
L:  So.
R:  Right, so I mean --
L:  I don't know, I think that -- I mean, I don't -- I don't believe in having, um, the church in the schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, in private schools if their parents pay to send them there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, to a certain Catholic school or something like that.
R:  Mhm.  It's obviously going to be there in a -- in a private parochial school, they are going to have that, but, um, --
L:  Right.
R:  In a public school they -- they don't have it.  They do have it a little bit but it's not done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like in the parochial schools, you know.
L:  Right, well, I mean, I know a lot of people -- well, not necessarily people that are close to me but, um, you know, you hear people talking about they should -- you know, have to pray before class and all that kind of stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just, you know, it just has its place and, you know, whatever people want to believe it's fine but I just don't think it should be in the schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I don't know.
R:  I think they're talking about mainly, um, books.
L:  Right.
R:  So, but again --
L:  I think that -- that -- that goes --
R:  It carries over into other things.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, but I think the primary thing is they're -- they're talking about books for this subject and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like books that have swear words and things in it, um.
L:  Mhm.  You know, it's not even swear words that I care about, it's the undertone of how they feel about, you know, like we said, you know, racism, homophobia.
R:  I mean, it starts out with something like that, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, um, I know when I was in high school they had us read Catcher in the Rye, and every other -- you couldn't even go a whole sentence practically without swear words in them and they were kind of -- I'm from the nineteen sixties.
L:  Mm.
R:  Being in high school and, ah, that was kind of a big no no then.  I mean, you know, you couldn't say a swear word on TV, so [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you sure didn't really expect to see them in your books in school, you know, and there was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a big to do about it.  They didn't end up burning books or anything like that, but, um, a lot of parents were very upset when they found out what the kids were reading because, you know, sometimes you can say a swear word in a -- in a certain way and it like has its place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or has some meaning, but to read it in every sentence in a book.
L:  Right.
R:  Or every other sentence in a book for a ninth or tenth grader is kind of like not -- not too good and neither would a book that, um, promoted racism or hatred of certain races or nationalities, ah, you know, I don't think that would be good either.
L:  Yeah, I think -- I mean, part of it [COUGH] for me is the people that are making those decisions.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they don't necessar- -- I mean, necessarily believe what they believe so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they are going to be telling, you know, me what my kids are reading or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just --
R:  Which would be, what, the school board of the schools or?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I mean, it depends on, you know.
R:  I think --
L:  How --
R:  Something like that --
L:  How involved the government is getting.
R:  Yeah.  They -- they should have like more parent input into it and have, you know, somebody like that instead of just elected official.
L:  Right.
R:  Because, um, it's your kid.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they should have some of the parents being there to make these decisions if they are going to censor some things and to what extent are they going to censor things.
L:  The only -- the only problem I have with that is if like I com -- where I live is very liberal.  I'm in a college town.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they're -- they're very much about promoting, you know, diversity and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if you have, you know, kids, you know, you know, say, of African American in Alabama, and the white parents are the ones deciding what they're reading.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, those kids are growing up reading what their parents have learned which is not necessarily good.
R:  Well --
L:  -- either.  You know, if you -- if you come from a diverse area in a school, I don't see why they couldn't have somebody be a spokesman from each segment of society there.
R:  Mhm, right.  So that everybody could be equally +represented -- represented.  I mean --
L:  But the people in power aren't going to want that.
R:  I know, I know.
L:  So that might be kinda hard.
R:  But then you have to fight for it.
L:  Right.
R:  That's how you get somewhere, you have to --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- you have to get somebody on your side or get a senator or representative or something on your -- council man or somebody on your side or go through your local PTA or whatever, and you have to work for it.  That's how all the laws got made is everybody had to start standing up for themselves.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so that's how they would -- I mean, everything -- nothing's going to be perfect in an imperfect world, so you just have to, you know, fight it the best you can and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And hope for the best and do what you can to help it if you can and --
L:  Right, and make sure that they're teaching their children at home too and they can -- no one -- they're saying something that they don't necessarily agree with and can have the education to argue that point.
R:  Right.  Well, if your kid comes home telling you something of what happened in school, you can set him straight at home or --
L:  Right.  Well, I don- -- I mean, even the children -- even the kids in school, I mean, by the time they're, you know, in middle school and high school, they can have their own opinions on what they're taught, you know, that that's acceptable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know to do that.
R:  Right.  They can -- you don't necessarily have to be argumentative to make your point.  You can just say, "Isn't there another side to this?"  Or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or whatever, you know, if they're trying to, um, to censor them or, um, lim- limit their participation in that, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if they go home and tell their parents, then their parents can get involved in what's censored and what's not censored and to what extent they're going to do it or form a committee or something because if you have one person making all the decisions, then you're going by whatever they think.
L:  Right.
R:  And so you -- you need more people involved before a decision is made.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that you get a broader base.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like you were saying with African American or if you have Spanish people involved.
L:  Right.
R:  Or you have Chinese people involved that are in these classes or schools or certain areas where --
L:  We have a -- we have an alternative, ah, community school here and there's actually, um, two board sheets that students sit on.
R:  Oh, that would be good too.
L:  Themselves, and they -- and they actually have input into who gets hired there and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's a really progressive school; they don't give out grades.
R:  Oh.
L:  They teach math and science together.  They have to --
R:  Like a pass fail kind of thing?
L:  Yeah, they have to have community service to graduate.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um, you know, it's a very, you know, different kind of school, but they do have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that input.
R:  Well, you know, if they do get involved with the community, then when they finish school, they're able to, you know, blend in with the community because they've had some experience.
L:  Mhm.
R:  With that so --
L:  Right.
R:  So and somebody had to decide on that, you know, that -- that's a form of censorship in a way because they're deciding in a positive way that they're going to do this.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, to add that to the curriculum to make them a more well rounded individual.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there's just, you know, I just think if you have books that are very lewd or very, um, a lot of immense profanity in them --
L:  Mm.
R:  That they're really not -- if a student gets that book on their own --
L:  Mhm.
R:  On their own time, then that's between them and the parents, but if they're going to the school library, I don't -- I don't think they should have those kind of books there necessarily because, you know, you're going to get somebody reading that and they're going to start saying those things, and it, ah, -- because they -- kids imitate what they see, what they hear, what they read and what they, you know, so you have to be careful what they're getting a hold of, you know.  I -- I don't want to be the person that decides all that but I think it has -- it does have its place to a certain extent.
L:  Mm.
R:  Just not -- not like total rule where you're only going to read this book by this author and that's it.  But -- you have to have a choice but, um, I don't know.  I -- I would not -- I would not want my child to read Catchers in the Rye, like I -- when I started reading that, my mind was totally just somewhere else.  I thought what is this?  I'd never heard anything like that before and I couldn't even understand what the book was about there was so much swearing in it.
L:  Mhm.
