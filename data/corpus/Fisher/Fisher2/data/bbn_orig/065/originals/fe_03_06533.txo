R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Diana Longqvist from Buffalo, New York
R:  I am Lane Haggen from New York, New York.
L:  Hey.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are ya?
R:  Good.  So --
L:  I -- I work for a company that used to have random drug testing and it was pretty much mandatory every two years.  But they haven't done it in a long time.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, why haven't they done it do you know?
L:  Well, it's an international [SIGH] company and I think that, um, after a while I think they were, um, I don't know if it was cost because a lot of, uh, downsizing has happened but I think the other reason was that they had problems with people, um, you know, testing positive in some cases --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I think they were forced to put them through rehab [MN] because they can't really fire them because they figure it's a, like, a disease.
R:  Oh.
L:  Or it's a sickness.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think that maybe they just chose not to do that anymore.  I'm not sure but I -- I know that I've worked for the company for eight years and I was only tested once, which was in the beginning.  And the first two years had passed I thought I was going to be tested again and I have never been tested.   And no one else as far as I know either.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh, wow!  That's really interesting though that they would stop doing that because they felt the need to --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm assuming that.  I'm not saying that that was the reason.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm just assuming that on my part because, you know, of things that have happened and I think even with nine eleven, they had a lot of, uh, they were -- they immediately after nine eleven became more politically correct on a lot of things.  They were pretty much so, but they became more politically correct and, uh, you know, as far as floating holidays and they took certain holidays they wouldn't give you off; they give you floating holidays to accommodate other religions.
R:  Okay.  Huh.  Well, [LIPSMACK] I always though that drug testing was -- was good and was, you know, it should be done and I recently talked to a friend that does, um, he places people in temp jobs.
L:  Yes.
R:  And he's a recruiter and, um, he, in order for these people to be placed in these jobs they would have to be drug free.  And they'd have to g- -- undergo -- undergo drug testing.  So, when he's had people that, um, have done drugs or are doing them he's had to be, like, you know, if you are doing drugs, you need to let me know because you're not going to get anywhere if you are because you're going to show positive and, um, and when those people realize that they're not going to get a job no way, no how, bec- -- through this agency, through any temp agency --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, like, it's kind of a wake up call.  'Cause it's, like, well do you want a job?  Or do you not want a job?
L:  I think it's -- personally I think it's a good idea.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  I think, uh, I don't have a problem with it as an invasion of your privacy because in fact, you know, if you choose to do something like that, uh, it's one thing if you're not working or, you know, uh, you're doing it because your -- it's your own job, I mean, that's, you know, that's what you choose to do.  But when you work in a team atmosphere, I feel that it's an -- almost a necessity especially when you working like I do in some cases on machinery.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My safety is dependant, and safety of others is dependant on my being alert --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which of course a drug does not allow you to be in a lot of cases.  It doesn't -- your reaction times and things are -- are delayed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think it's just, you know, even mood swings can cause a lot of, uh, problems, which are, you know, your, you know, directly related to drugs.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- I think it's a good thing.  I think like you said, it's a wake up call for those people that are out -- out there.  You can choose to be responsible and you can choose to, uh, you know, go to work and pay your bills and do all of those things.  And, you know, regardless of how much money you make, if you're drug free that's fine, but if you're not, you're -- you are affecting other people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not just yourself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whether you're under the influence at that particular point or not.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And I think it affects relationships, which affect your job.  And I think it affects families --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, all in all, you know, not just your immediate family like, let's say your spouse and your children, but it also affects the, you know, your [PAUSE] s- satellite family so to speak.  You know, your brothers, you siblings, and -- and sisters and family and parents and grandparents and that, because it does affect if they are doing drugs.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I -- I agree.  And it's -- it's shocking to me when, um, people don't have to undergo it and then you -- you are in a work situation where you have people that, um, be it, you know, I don't know what kind of drugs but anything and you just -- they can't work, they can't function.  And also, uh, being under the influence of alcohol too because that's not necessarily a drug, but it is a drug.  
L:  Yes.
R:  You know -- 
L:  I agree.  Yes.  
R:  -- and that, I mean, I graduated recently and working with people that were obviously hung over and, um, you can't work with them at all.  And it's just [PAUSE] I think, I don't know, maybe something even along the lines of alcohol.  I don't know how alcohol is processed in the body and stuff so, I don't know how that would, you know --
L:  Well, I do, you know, I have a s- -- very similar situation.  I have, um, and again people at the w- -- place that I work at, um, have been known to go out at lunch time or whatever and they have a few, and then they come back, and you can definitely see the difference in their demeanor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can definitely see the difference in -- in their -- the quality of work that they do and the quantity of work that they do also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It doesn't have anything, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, there is no comparison as far as before and after because there's a definite difference.  And I think that if in fact they do do this drug testing and that I think it would make the entire work atmosphere a lot less stressful.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And because people aren't say feeling that they have to make up the difference or keep the secret and, you know, all -- all of the things that affect everybody's quality of work, you know.  I know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm not real comfortable because one particular person that goes out and drinks, and it's a woman, she becomes extremely verbally abusive to a --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- lot of her coworkers.  [LIPSMACK] Or extremely loud, which makes them uncomfortable in some cases.  And, um, you know, I -- I don't think it's fair to those people to have to put up with that kind of behavior --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, in the workplace.  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's different if you choose to go out and party or do something, but in the workplace there just isn't I don't feel there's --
R:  It's just unnecessary.
L:  -- there's room for that.  Right.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  And the drug testing, the random drug testing would keep them a little more legal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, if in fact they did that on a regular basis like they used to in my particular case, people would be less apt to feel that they could get away with it on a regular basis than they do now.
R:  Mhm.  Do you find that people are against it in your workplace?   Or what do you --
L:  I don't really think that the -- I -- because it was, uh, a, um, [LIPSMACK] what do you call it?  A, um, [LIPSMACK] for hire -- it was, uh, one of the stipulations for -- of them to sign a waiver when they were hired to allow them to random drug test them and, um, I don't think that there -- it's never really come up as a -- as a discussion as to whether or not people are for or against.  I mean, they'll -- or against it.  I think most people expected it because they felt that it was, um, a way of making sure that their safety and their quality and everything was going to be maintained from a company standpoint.  And, um, you know, you -- you talk about some drugs.  Some drugs are -- I -- I -- I don't want to say safe, but are less affective or a lo- -- a- affecting of people as far as danger goes, you know, and, uh, let's say somebody that got, I don't know, some kind of PCB or some kind of cocaine or something that could have dramatic mood swings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- could become a real safety threat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think people respected that from the company.  But the- -- they're not doing it now.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But they have that option.  I mean, I guess that's where it's -- boils down to.  They probably found that the majority of people weren't so they felt it was maybe not necessary at this particular time.  That's another, you know, thought that I've had and if that's the case well then, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] you know, maybe at some time if they felt that they needed to do that because of somebody's behavior; if someone chose to take this --
