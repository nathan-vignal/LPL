R:  Hi, I'm Kathy.
L:  Kathy, this is Harriet in Atlanta.
R:  Hi, Harriet.  Well, you're not far away.  I'm in Savannah. 
L:  Are you?  Oh --
R:  I sure am.
L:  -- right. [LAUGH]
R:  You're the closest person I've talked to.
L:  Oh, right.  I -- I have been missing these calls for so long --
R:  Have you really?
L:  I'm like -- yes.  I'm like, every time I check my answer machine and my -- my voice mail, I'm on my cellphone, and then I will find out, "Oh man, I had a call".
R:  Well, I've missed a couple, but I've also gotten a couple, so, um --
L:  Mhm.  Now, have you gotten paid yet?
R:  Yes, as a matter of fact, um, I got a check just the other day.  They pay, you know, one call at a time.  You'll get a -- you'll get a check.  And they do pay, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [NOISE] um --
L:  'Cause I did one a couple months ago and I haven't gotten paid for it yet.
R:  Well, you know, I --
L:  But, anyway --
R:  I think they --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Uh, no, that's okay.  
L:  Okay.
R:  I was just gonna say, I know they had a problem with payment in the very beginning --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so you may want to contact them and just let them know you haven't been paid.  
L:  Okay.  All right.
R:  Okay.
L:  Now, what are we discussing here?
R:  We're supposed to be discussing drug testing, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and how do we feel --
L:  I am all for it.
R:  Well, it -- this is the oddest thing.  First of all, it's odd that we're so close.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Second of all, I work in the drug testing lab on Fort Stewart.
L:  Do you?  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yes, I do indeed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do indeed.  Um --
L:  That is so wild.
R:  I do, um, you know, kind of the admin side of things.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but --
L:  So, are you for -- are you for the dr- -- then you are for the drug testing?
R:  I don't have any problem with it.  I mean, as long as the people know up front that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- this -- this happens in this company, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you don't like it, you don't have to take the job.
L:  That's right.
R:  And --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- you know, if you don't have anything to hide, then what's the problem?
L:  Right.  
R:  You know, um --
L:  That's for sure.  
R:  And -- and truth be told -- and this is something that I've discovered, you know, in -- in my work -- it is so, so easy to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, get around --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a drug test. 
L:  Really?  That is sad.
R:  Oh, yeah, oh yeah.  Uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it definitely is.  I mean, in -- in the military, it's a little more difficult, because you have someone observing you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as you urinate, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the civilian sector, um, if you just know what you're doing, uh, it would be very easy for somebody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to get around one.
L:  Wh- when I think about it, I remember somebody had told me that a friend -- this one girl was doing drugs and she had this girl to go in as her to get tested.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes, she had someone to go in as her to get tested.  Now --
R:  Now, that one I had not, um, I had not heard.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm a little bit surprised by it, because normally you have to show some sort of ID.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, well, she probably had the ID and, you know, they don't pay much attention to it.
R:  Well, that -- that must have been the case.  Um --
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  Wherever she got tested, it probably -- uh, it couldn't have been a very, um, [LIPSMACK] accurate environment, let's say.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.  So, how are things in Savannah?
R:  Well, things are -- are wonderful here.  You know, it's -- it's full scale summer, and, um, [LIPSMACK] so, ah, it's -- it's hot and the humidity's starting, but, you know, you're in Atlanta, so you're no stranger to that --
L:  Right.  That's for sure. [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I love living in Savannah, I really do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  Do you know, I've never been there.  I've been here seventeen years, and I have never been to Savannah and that's --
R:  You absolutely must make a trip down, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and visit.  It really is quite, quite beautiful.  Um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The architecture in the historic distri- district is so well preserved, and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they've done such a good job of renovating the old, older homes, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, it's just -- it's really, really a very charming city.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  Yeah, I pl- -- I plan on coming to visit sometime soon.
R:  You absolutely should.
L:  I am stand- -- I am -- excuse me, I am standing outside, and I see a wasp, and if this wasp come in my direction, I might have to hang up this phone.  I'm on my cellphone [LAUGH].
R:  I understand, I understand.  Wasps are nothing to fool around with.
L:  Oh, I got stung last year, and, you know, usu- -- they tell you that usually, um, a wasp doesn't -- they don't -- they don't do anything to you unless you, you know, you -- you know, I mean, you have to disturb a nest or do something.  I saw this wasp, I was trying to get in my house, and I said, "Well, let me just run to my house".  The wasp came behind me and stung me.
R:  I've had them chase me before.
L:  I could not believe that.
R:  I -- I have.
L:  How could you chase you, if you haven't done anything? [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  But --
R:  -- I -- maybe it's the quick movement that -- that freaks them out.  I don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh --
L:  Yeah, maybe that's what it is.
R:  I don't -- I don't fool around with wasps or hornets.  Um --
L:  Yeah, me either, me either.
R:  You know, a -- a honey bee or a yellow jacket bumble bee, I'll take my chances with them, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not wasps and hornets.  
L:  Mhm.  I guess we better get back on the drug testing [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we probably -- we probably should.  
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  Um, but, um, you know, I -- I really don't have a problem with it.  Now, I will also say that, in my opinion, marijuana should be legalized, and that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- money should be -- the money spent trying to stop something that's never going to be stopped any more than alcohol is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- should be diverted into education and into rehabilitation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, for some drugs that, without question, will ruin someone's life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I -- I -- see, I've never tried drugs, ever in my life.  I just never had a desire, but I guess I don't know the effect -- I -- I know people who d- -- who do marijuana, and I know that -- I mean, I don't see -- I mean, I used to know people, I don't know anybody now, actually.
R:  Well, Harriet, I've known a lot of people, um, many years ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I was one --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I can tell you to an absolute certainty, I don't think that marijuana is nearly as dangerous as alcohol.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I'm sure, it can't be.
R:  Um, not -- not nearly, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's -- is it mentally addictive?  Probably yes, um, to a certain extent, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, it's -- I quit smoking pot.  I quit smoking cigarettes, and I can tell you quitting smoking cigarettes was a whole lot harder.
L:  Really?  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, oh, absolutely.
L:  Mhm.  I guess so, 'cause when you think about it, I know when I was in college, almost everybody was smoking marijuana --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, and, um, and those people who were smoking it, you know, they didn't have a problem, just stopped smoking, you know.
R:  No, no.  I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, it's -- it's kind of like if you're in a restaurant and, ah, you order a drink, and you have that one drink and then you decide you don't want another one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you just -- it's no big deal, you know.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  Um, but, you know, I -- I do feel that that should be the case.  But the fact is, that's not the law.  And as long --
L:  So --
R:  -- as it's not the law, I think that, uh, companies who have a lot at stake financially, um, [MN] I think they have a right to -- to test you if they choose to do that.
L:  Yes, I agree.  I agree.  I mean, they are paying you a salary, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if they want, you know -- even if they do random testing, but you know that they're going to do random testing, you know [MN] --
R:  Right, just as long as you know up front, um --
L:  Right, I agree, I agree.
R:  -- that it's a condition of employment.  And I'll take it a step further, and say that in some fields, um, let's say, if you're in medicine and you're holding people's lives in your hands --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, if you are a professional driver, a truck driver or -- or, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, something like that, I think [MN] that [MN] companies should be obligated to test you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, legally.  Now, with truck drivers, of course, they are.  But --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, I think that there are a lot of fields where, um, people are doing very dangerous work where they're putting themselves and other people in jeopardy, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they are using drugs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, you know, in that kind of situation, I think it's -- it's a very serious responsibility of that company to make sure that it isn't happening.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  So, if -- if they -- if they did make, ah, marijuana legal, do you feel that -- I think, isn't it in California, where, um, it's legal for -- if it's for medication, or for something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Something like that.
R:  For -- for medical use, yes.
L:  For medical use, uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So, if they didn't make it legal overall, do you think that they should do that across the board, ah, in the United States?
R:  I absolutely do.
L:  Do you?  Okay.
R:  Because I know, um, I -- I used to, ah, do volunteer work with hospice when I lived in Charlotte --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I know too many people who went through chemotherapy, who truly were helped, um, in terms of the nausea --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the side effects of the chemo --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- by marijuana.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It really does.
L:  You know, I've learned so much from talking to you, because, you know, I had no idea.  I'm like, "Well, no, I don't think marijuana should be legal, I don't think any drug should be legal", but I'm learning so much from you.
R:  Well, you're very kind to say that, and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um, you know, it's -- everybody is entitled to their opinion, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't honestly think that it's ever going to change.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it will be interesting, you know, Ontario is about to legalize.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, they --
L:  I didn't realize that, uh-huh.
R:  -- sure are.  And, ah, it will be very interesting to see just how that goes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so I don't know, I mean, maybe at some point in the future, we'll see it.  But, frankly, I'm concerned more about some of the newer drugs, Ecstasy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, for example, which, [SIGH] I've got a feeling that the young --
