L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, hi [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My name's -- I'm Ann Marie.
R:  Your name is what?
L:  Ann Marie.
R:  Ann Marie?  Hi, Ann Marie.  My name's Brenda.
L:  Hello.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Tennessee.
R:  You're kidding?  So am I [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Gee, I thought they were, like, you know, doing far flung regions [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's neat.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so what's your take on all this?  I --
L:  I didn't get the whole thing.  My daughter was talking over some of it.
R:  [MN]
L:  What was ...?
R:  Yeah, it was hard to understand anyway.  Um --
L:  Something about how would it affect my view on marriages?  What was the --
R:  Yeah, the divorce rate --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in our country.  How it affects your view on marriage --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and has it changed your views, I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- something to that effect.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It was kinda hard to understand, but --
L:  Okay.  [inaudible] my daughter here, helping me make pizza.  I didn't get it all.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I have a six year old.  Luckily he's not in here right now --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so knock on wood.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I -- I don't know.  I think it's a good question though.  Um --
L:  Honestly, I think a divorce -- I think it's [NOISE] the person themselves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] I believe in marriage 'til death do us part.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] And that's how I go into marriage, that's how I was raised --
R:  Right.
L:  -- being Catholic and --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  
L:  So -- and it's -- you know, I figure that's the way it's gonna be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's the way it's gonna stay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, yes, there might be a few things that might change my mind that may make -- get a divorce.  But the way the rate is, I don't [MN] view that as a problem getting myself [NOISE] -- me getting married or ...
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  No, me either.  But I think, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think if I were [SIGH] -- I think if I were single --
L:  [NOISE] Okay, that's enough cheese on it.
R:  -- I would -- I -- I may do things differently.  Like I may go, uh, I maybe -- I -- I may consider counselling before marriage and --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- stuff like that.  Which, you know, I didn't think about because my [SIGH] -- of course our parents counsel us if we're lucky, you know.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  We have certain values, like you said, that we're raised with --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know?  And it's nothing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be taken lightly.  I mean, we don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- those of us who are old hands at it don't think, "Well, if I don't like it I can get out".
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Well, see, I think a lot of people use divorce as the easy way out --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- [NOISE] than working things out [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I do, too, and it's [NOISE] -- oh, my goodness, it's a very difficult thing.  A friend of mine told me that -- and this was just before I got married, she said, "You know, I cried for a solid year [LAUGH] when I got married".  [SIGH] She said, "But we've been married, like, thirty something years now" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she said, "Back then, you know, people worked things out".
L:  Right.
R:  And she said, "It took me a year to stop crying" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but she said, "I finally, you know, grew up enough to realize that I had taken vows --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- and I had to adhere to those vows".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, uh, but now, it's just -- it is, it's very, very easy --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and I think maybe if it was harder -- maybe if it was harder to get divorced, you know --
L:  Yeah, they make it too easy.
R:  -- like it used to be.  Yeah, I mean, no fault divorce and all that. [MN] Maybe if it was harder, it would make a difference.
L:  [NOISE] And I know with me being married in the church --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'd have to go get the whole thing annulled before I could do it again. [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's right.  The Catholics have a definite view on that, don't they?
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I mean, you can't just say, "I'm outta here", right?
L:  [NOISE] Right, exactly.  
R:  Yeah.  What sort of thing do you have to go through?  Very interested in that.
L:  Honestly?  I don't know, 'cause I've never gone through it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  I know that [MN] --
R:  That's to your credit.
L:  -- they don't recognize a divorce.
R:  Right.
L:  You have to go through annulment.  I know annulment takes years --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to get.  It takes quite some time to get [NOISE].
R:  Right.
L:  And basically you've gotta prove the reason for the marriage or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  I know a friend of mine [SIGH] when they -- he -- she got married, it was her husband's second marriage.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was because he was in the military and his wife was cheating on him when he was gone. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, it took quite some time before he could even -- you know, they ended up eloping because they couldn't get married in the church because of how --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- long it was gonna take to get the annulment.  
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Did the church ever accept them?
L:  Um, [SIGH] yes, it did, because --
R:  Good.
L:  -- it wasn't his fault, it wasn't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- him, you know.  It was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause his wife [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they d- -- they frown, of course, on cheating.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  I was gonna ask you if that's one of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reasons that you -- you were able to get a divorce if you -- if you had --
L:  I'm assuming that's -- that it would [NOISE] go for -- I mean, I don't know.  For sure I'm thinking that's the reason why he did get his annulment.
R:  Right.  'Cause that's like, you know, it oughta be that way in our court system, I think.  There oughta have to be concrete --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reasons.  And they need to be good ones.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I mean, abuse, you know?  And I mean real abuse.  Um, [SIGH] infidelity -- and I think -- 'cause I mean, that's biblical.  You know, infidelity.  I think that's the only reason --
L:  That's the only reason --
R:  -- in fact.
L:  -- I would ever go for it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's the only one.
L:  [NOISE] I would never stand for that.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, me either.  
L:  So -- and I trust my husband fully.  I know he would never do that, as much as he's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gone overseas and travelling --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the military.
R:  Right.
L:  So ... [NOISE]
R:  Right, [MN] yeah, you have to trust.  But, yeah, I agree with you.  I think that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that is the only reason, um --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- in the Christian church for divorce, I think.  But [SIGH] it's just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people don't even get married now, for crying out loud [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, [SIGH] you know it's -- we- we've taken a step beyond easy divorce --
L:  So ...
R:  -- and it probably had a lot to do with it.  It's just, you know, the lax morals in general, don't you think?
L:  Right.  I mean, if I look at my friends, my -- one of my best friends was married [SIGH] not even a year --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a little over a year and they got divorced.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [SIGH] You know, they -- I think they jumped into their marriage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a little too quickly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- only knowing each other less than [NOISE] three months.
R:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.
L:  So ... 
R:  Well, I knew my husband eight years, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  [NOISE] Yes, I went to college with my husband.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was seven years from the time I met him before we got married. [NOISE]
R:  Isn't that funny?  [SIGH] And you know there's -- there's a lot to be said for that.  I mean, there really, really is.
L:  [NOISE] I mean, there was a time we were separated too, for a while, because --
R:  Yeah.  Us too.
L:  -- things just didn't work out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then we realized --
R:  Right.
L:  -- other people weren't what we wanted.
R:  Right.  Yup, us too.
L:  So ...
R:  So, you know, it's -- but there's just something, um, I don't know, there's something -- there's a spiritual tearing, I think, when a divorce takes place, and people don't realize that.  I think it's very hard on both parties.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No matter who wants it, I think it's hard, and just doesn't seem to hold up in our society, but ...
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Anyway, I can't think of anything else to say about this, [LAUGH] can you?
L:  No, I can't either.  I just think people take it as an easy way out.  
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  You either eat the pepperoni, don't put it back on the pizza.
R:  [LAUGH] How old is she?
L:  [LAUGH] She's two and a half.
R:  Oh, my -- cute.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  My oldest is seven, this one's two and a half, and I have one due in three weeks.  
R:  Wow, really?
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my goodness.  How many are you gonna have, you know?
L:  Oh, this should be our last one.
R:  Really?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We have five at home.  Yeah, my youngest is --
L:  [NOISE] I came from a family of five.
R:  Huh?  You came from a family of five?
L:  Yes.
R:  Mm.
L:  And my mom keeps telling me, "You gotta have more, the more the merrier, [NOISE] it's no -- more -- it's not fun unless you have more".  I'm like, "Okay". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh boy, I agree with her, you know.  I kinda --
L:  I don't know how people could handle [LAUGH] --
R:  I wanted to have more, I did, but I -- I just felt like the time had come to stop.  I really, really did.  [SIGH] But, um --
L:  [NOISE] I want a boy, is what I want.
R:  -- this girl I know has nine.  Oh, you have a boy?
L:  No, I have -- I'm gonna have another girl [NOISE] [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Well, good for you, but yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that's what I did.  I kept trying 'til I had a boy.
L:  That's what my mom did.  Her last one [NOISE] was a boy [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I had a boy and then I had another girl and then I had another boy, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I ended up with two.  I was just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- thrilled to death with that.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  But we, um, we just kept on -- you know, kept on.  My husband said, "You have 'em, I'll support 'em, just have as many as you can".  [LAUGH] I said --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Okay, five's my limit, that's it".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Now here I am, you know, I'm, like, forty eight years old --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I have a six year old and -- luckily people don't ask me if I'm his grandmother too often, so -- but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] I'm gonna say, you're not the only one who has young kids at your age.
R:  Yeah, no --
L:  I know a lot of people who have --
R:  It's a trend now.
L:  -- especially in the military, it's funny, [NOISE] they have these teenage kids and they're all of a sudden having other kids.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what we did.  We -- yeah, actually, I have six, 'cause I had a daughter from a [SIGH] previous --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- marriage that I rushed into that didn't work out.  That's what we're talking about, isn't it?
L:  Right. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] But I will say in my defence, it was my choice to work it out --
L:  Right [NOISE].
R:  -- you know?  I was like, "Oh no, no, [LAUGH] there's gotta be a way to work this out" and he didn't want to, [NOISE] so not much you can do about that.
L:  No.  I -- I -- I think --
R:  When there's another woman involved, you know, but ...
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, but that was a long time ago, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but yeah, we just -- we just wanted a whole new family --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, wanted to start all over, so [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's -- it's been real good for us.  We've enjoyed it [SIGH].  But yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a trend now, I think, for older women to have children and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I kinda think that's neat, you know?  I think it's kinda nice.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know how you do it.  I don't even have the energy to keep up with these.
R:  [LAUGH] I didn't say it was easy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There are days -- oh, there are days -- a few weeks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ago I was saying, "Lord, what was I thinking?  Two boys?  Why?"
L:  [NOISE] Everybody tells me how much easier it has -- to have boys than it is the girls.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm like, "I don't know". [LAUGH]
R:  No way, oh my.  There's no way, they're boys, they do boy stuff.  
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  They -- they think boy things and they, you know -- [SIGH] I mean, they're [SIGH] lovely children, they are, they're very well behaved.  But they still think like boys [SIGH].  That means they take everything apart, hopefully put it back together, you know --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, oh no, [LAUGH] no, don't listen to 'em. [LAUGH] It's not a bit easier.
L:  [NOISE] No, you can't talk, Evelyn.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  Evelyn.  Evelyn wants to talk.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] She likes to pick up the phone and talk.
R:  Oh.  
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  That's so cute. 
L:  [MN]
R:  I love toddlers. [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, how long have we been talking, Ann Marie?
L:  I don't know.  That's what I'm wondering, 'cause aren't we supposed --
R:  I don't know either.
L:  -- to at least talk for eight minutes on the topic?
