L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Linda. 
L:  Hi, Linda.  I'm Heather.
R:  Hi, Heather.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Have you?
L:  Yeah, this is, uh --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're supposed to talk about, um --
L:  Drug testing.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So, any ideas on how you feel about it?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think it's an invasion of privacy.  I think it's a -- probably a necessity in some, um [LIPSMACK], careers, or some job markets.
L:  Huh. 
R:  Like -- like for transportation.  For bus drivers and pilots and truck drivers.  
L:  The --
R:  You know, I think it's a necessity. 
L:  'Cause otherwise they're just gonna do it and drive off the road or whatever.
R:  Yeah, they're a danger to everyone on the road, you know.
L:  Do they do that now with those professions?  I don't think so.
R:  I don't -- I don't know. 
L:  It's usually not --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- those kinds of companies that have mandatory testing, I don't think.
R:  My husband used to work for an airline, and they would, like, just do a spot test every now and then.  You know, just --
L:  Really?
R:  -- of one or two people.  It wasn't --
L:  Was he a pilot?
R:  No, he was a mechanic on --
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
R:  -- um, airline.
L:  Huh.  So they did it, like, not very often?
R:  Not very often, and it would just be, uh, "Hey, the computer selected you this month to, uh, you know --"
L:  Huh.
R:  "-- have a random drug test".
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I don't know -- I -- I don't know how fast I would take a job that did that.  It would just kind of freak me out.  I mean, I can understand that it probably makes the workforce a safer place, but --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It, ah, I mean, I don't know.  Like, right now I'm teaching kids, and if they said that, if it was a mandatory thing, I don't know how -- how bad they --
R:  Well, [MN] you -- you know, I think it just depends on the job you have, because, like, you know, if -- if you were doing something -- well, it would depend on what it was, but, you know, I just think that if you're out there -- that if you're driving a semi truck down the road, you know, I wanna know, you know, if you're on my road, I wanna know that you're fully, fully there and alert, you know.
L:  I mean, that's true, but I guess that's true with every -- I wanna know that all the time with every driver, you know.  And it's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people are out there all the time who are too tired, or drinking or on their cellphone, smoking, whatever, and not paying attention.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, like, you know, I'd [SIGH] -- I'd be happy, I guess, if, you know, I lived abroad and they had a no cellphone, ah, rule.  You had to have a earpiece, whatever, [MN] and, ah, you know, I see people here just driving around [inaudible] and not paying [LAUGH], you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is probably, I mean, certainly could be as dangerous as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, well, [MN] some jobs I think they just drug test you if you have an accident.  Or, you know, an accident --
L:  Oh, after --
R:  -- at work or, you know, something -- something happens on a job and -- and, you know, then they -- they test you only under those circumstances.  So, that would be okay, too, you know.
L:  Huh.  Yeah, then I guess you're sort of, uh, hoping nothing happens in case you actually are -- I don't know.  It's just like, I mean [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] people drink and -- and none of that stuff is tested for.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And you could be -- I mean, it's all a matter of what's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- legal and what isn't, I guess.  But you could say, what if you smoked pot, like, on your day off -- you had a week off or something, and then, I don't know, three weeks later they tested you for it and it showed up positive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And had nothing to do, actually, with the fact that --
R:  Well, I think --
L:  -- your work.  I mean --
R:  I think they should legalize that anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that's certainly one of the things they're testing for.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Whereas, if your blood alcohol level came up as -- I -- I was drinking three weeks ago, like that would be, "Who cares?"  Like, [inaudible] [SIGH].
R:  Yeah, and it doesn't -- I don't think it stays in your system that long, either.
L:  Probably not.  Probably --
R:  For -- for --
L:  -- they can't tell if someone's been drinking a week ago, or whatever.  
R:  Well, I think if -- if drinking is legal then smoking should be legal, because I -- I don't, you know, and the commercials say, like, smoking pot is, um, like --
L:  That it's -- it's worse than we thought it was, or something?
R:  Yeah, but cigarettes are legal, so, you know.
L:  And actually, when you, uh -- for -- for insurance for, uh, smokers, they pay a little more. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it's known to be a risky behavior in terms of your driving.
R:  Yeah, well, I don't --
L:  Because you're distracted.
R:  I don't think that pot smoking is as bad as ... is as bad for you.  I mean, people, you know -- [MN] I think liquor is worse.  I -- I mean, drinking and driving is certainly worse, and, you know, you do really stupid things.  People do stupid things when they're drunk --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and --
L:  That's for sure.
R:  -- you know, I just think they should legalize it and --
L:  So, with your husband it was never a problem, though, 'cause he's not --
R:  No, he --
L:  Never came up with ...? [LAUGH]
R:  No.  No.
L:  So, [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  They say that a lot of those pilots have, ah, [SIGH] problems with alcohol, so -- so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they may not be taking drugs. [LAUGH]
R:  Ha, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Maybe they should just test them for everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Put a camera on them at all times, and then we'll know what they're doing.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, well, it's kinda scary to think you might get on a plane with somebody who's too drunk to know what to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and the plane's just flying itself.
L:  Well, there are so many alcoholics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who really can manage on a day to day basis, and, you know, maybe they don't get drunk until way after work or -- but they really do drink every day.  It's kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, when you think about -- and I'm sure they have responsible jobs and stuff too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I know a bar, if you go by a bar, and they are always full.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  At, you know, six o'clock in the morning they open, and, you know, they're busy.  It's --
L:  Well, somebody's in there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably the people getting off of work at that hour [SIGH].
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't know, no.  I have to say I'd have some reluctance if they told me that that was a requirement.  I wouldn't, uh, be thrilled [LAUGH].  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even though I'm not doing that stuff, I'd still -- I don't know, it just seems like -- now they've got this property and they can look at any -- you know, [MN] I don't know, it does seem rather invasive.
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of like what you do -- what you do in your own time should be your own business, but at the same time if -- you know, if it makes you a danger, I -- to the community -- I guess there's cert- certain drugs that I would be more concerned about than others.  For ex- -- you know, for testing.
L:  Oh, they definitely test for everything, I'm sure they're not just testing for heroin or whatever, they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- definitely testing for everything.
R:  Yeah.  So, there's no -- there's no right or, [MN] um, [LIPSMACK] right answer for me.  I mean, I can see both sides of it, you know.  
L:  Well, would you take a job where that was a mandatory requirement?
R:  I would, yeah.  It wouldn't bother me, but, um, I -- I don't know.  I think once I'd -- once I'd pass it, they wouldn't have to, um, require it again.  So, I don't know how I feel about that.
L:  Oh, I'm sure they do it, though, every, like, few months or something though.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not a one time thing [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  'Cause that -- that would be like letting people kno- -- if they only did it once, then you'd feel like, okay, they -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you had a problem, then you'd just make sure you were clean the first time until, uh, until then [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Then you'd go out and smoke, what -- do whatever.  So, yeah, they'd have to have a policy where they were doing it, ah, all the time.  Wow, I don't now. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  I think some of these, ah, large companies are actually the ones doing it.  I don't think the government is doing it.  I worked in Congress, and they never did that.
R:  Really?
L:  [SIGH] Huh-uh.  It was just never a requirement, and they talked about -- I think -- let me think, what, in ninety two they talked about making it a requirement, um, for some of these jobs in the executive branch.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And people start -- I know some of my friends started freaking out. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That they were going to start doing this.
R:  Well, I don't think they should make us do anything that they wouldn't make, um, everybody do.  You know, why -- why make just, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah, we're basically just pushing paper around, too, it's not, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're not out there actually [MN] flying a plane or driving anything or whatever, so I think they just were [SIGH], excuse me, trying to make a point that, [SIGH] "If you're gonna work here, you're gonna -- we're gonna make sure you don't have a problem".  But people started panicking about these tests, and when we won the election and then a few months later people started getting these appointments [MN], and then they said they were going to have testing, so it became an issue.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I remember a long time ago, when it -- it was a polygraph you had to take.  And then they stopped doing the polygraphs --
L:  Really?  It wasn't even admissible.
R:  -- and went to drug testing.
L:  Wow.  What were they polygraphing for?
R:  Ah, well, I worked at a casino in Las Vegas, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I had to do a poly -- you have to do --
L:  No kidding.
R:  -- a poly to get hired, and then after --
L:  What kind of questions do they ask you about?  If you steal or something, I suppose?
R:  Yeah, stuff like that.  And, um --
L:  Wow, so they wanna make sure you're not going to steal cash.
R:  Oh, yeah, they go -- you -- you have to do a whole lot of stuff to work in a casino.  Like, you have to be fingerprinted and everything.
L:  Right.  Well, that's true with the schools, too, you have to be fingerprinted.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.  So, it's more than just having a record.  Wow, so they don't -- they're not allowed to do that --
