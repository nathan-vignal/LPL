L:  Hi, this is 
R:  Hello.
L:  -- Aileen.
R:  Hi, this is Lena.
L:  Hi Lena, how are you?
R:  Hi, I'm good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Okay, I'm -- I'm not sure I heard the topic that w- what was it about?
L:  The topic is, um, drug testing in companies.
R:  Oh --
L:  Do, you know do we feel it's an invasion of privacy or not.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I think it's a justified invasion of privacy.
L:  Okay.  See and I feel the same way because first off drugs are illegal.  And if you're bringing into the workforce --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's a good chance that you could be jeopardizing somebody else, depending on what type of job it is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, if you work with machinery and somebody is high --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what happens if something goes wrong?
R:  Mhm.  And, like, this, um, this is, um, invasion of privacy but if you -- you know, come to work on drugs then you're, like, bringing your private business into a public place.  So, I think, um, it's a good idea.
L:  Yeah.  I've worked for several companies and all of them have tested.  And I have --
R:  Oh, really!
L:  -- absolute -- oh yeah.  And I have -- I have no prob- -- uh, they've tested during, you know, employment process.
R:  Oh, I --  
L:  -- they've never -- they've never drug tested, you know, on, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the spot checking.
R:  What kinda -- what kind of job was it for?
L:  It was just management.  It was, like, it wasn't --
R:  Oh, [inaudible] 
L:  -- in government.  It wasn't in, um, any public -- it was actually a privately held company -- actually all of them were.  You know, just regular middle America companies.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And every single one of them, it's now part of an application process.  Would you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- submit to a drug test?  And I have absolutely no problems saying yes.  I mean, you can test me any time you want but I have nothing to hide.
R:  Mhm.  So, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm taking it that you're not a drug user?
L:  No.  N- -- definitely not.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Definitely not [inaudible] so, well let's -- do you believe that it's a private right to take drugs?
L:  No.
R:  No.  Okay.
L:  I think if it -- no.  It -- it's -- if it's illegal and the government has --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- said it's illegal, then no, it should not be.  And I think should all be punished if they're caught.  Same thing you lose your job if you're caught.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I wouldn't want my daughter using drugs. 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, so you have a daughter?
L:  Uh, yeah.  She's fifteen.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, you know, I wouldn't want somebody exposing it to her.  And if she was working --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and somebody was bringing it into the workforce --
R:  Mm hm.
L:  -- no.  I wouldn't want her in a company that -- that has people that are using drugs.
R:  So, do they -- they only test during the, um, like, hiring process and they don't check after that?  They don't test you guys after?
L:  Uh, my company didn't unless there was a reason.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then it would have to go -- unless -- then it would have to go through the human resource department.  Because once you've submitted to one and you came out clean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, once you're hired then it's, you know, then the company has to protect themselves.  Because it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was never -- it was never a set standard that they could arbitrarily do it to anybody they wanted.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, if there was a reason then we would actually submit and we are -- we've actually sent people to c- -- for counseling.
R:  Oh, really.  Okay. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, what kind of other -- is there, like, a blood test only?  Or, like, urine sample?  Or how do they carry out the test?
L:  Um, ours, we would send them to a lab to have a urine test or -- and or blood test, depending.
R:  Uh-huh.  Obviously it's not too -- it's not too big of a hassle or anything, right?
L:  No.  And it's not li- -- and nobody actually even know it except for the human resource department or -- and your direct manager.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  It -- they w- -- you know, it's not in the -- major embarrassment; it's not --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- somebody walks up to you at the cafeteria table and says, "Here's a cup, go pee".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it -- it's all done privately and companies have to protect themselves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to make sure that they're not invading somebody's privacy or em- embarrassing them in public because then they ar- -- they're opening themselves up for another law suit.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Well, I've never, um, held, like, a professional, like, job or anything.  Well, I'm still a student so, I've just had my little part time jobs here in  [inaudible] I really wouldn't know how it feels to have, like, an actual, like, occupation and then have them, like, blood test me or anything.  But, like, okay, so, drug tests are not [inaudible] like, are not bad but what -- what about, um, I don't know, like, do you -- do you test for anything else besides drugs?  Do they, like, ask any oth- -- 
L:  Well, I went for, y- you go through a complete physical.
R:  Oh, you do, okay.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, let me ask you this; when are you graduating?  
R:  I'm a freshman in college so --
L:  Okay.  So --
R:  -- in three years. 
L:  -- it's three -- all right so three years from now the perfect job comes up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they say, "Okay, it's yours, but you have to go for a physical, you have to --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- have a blood -- drug testing and our company does check you occasionally, spot check you --" 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- for drugs".  Would you -- would you agree to it?
R:  I would definitely agree.  And in fact I would, um, I'd feel comfortable working in that kind of environment, like, 'cause I know that once I am hired, it'll be a very, like -- like, safe, regulated environment.  Not, like, I will -- I could be, you know, assured that my coworker won't come in, like, high the next day or anything.  So, I think I would, yeah, I think I'd definitely want that.
L:  You know, it's never a hundred percent guaranteed because people can get around the tests.
R:  Oh, that's true.
L:  You know, y- -- it just when it's spot checking you never know when it's going to be your turn so you're --
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  -- a little more cautious.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, hm.
L:  But you would have no problem going for that job.
R:  Not at all.
L:  Knowing that -- knowing that they're going to be doing this, you wouldn't consider it an invasion of your privacy?  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, not at all.  No.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Because, uh, if I switch it around, if I were the employer then I would, you know, I wouldn't want any old, like, drug addict or [inaudible] anyone like that to work for me.  So, um, as, like, it's for me as well as, like my other employees I should -- I think -- I would want to check everyone.  So, you know, I -- I totally understand if I were to, you know, go looking for a job and stuff.  So, for, like, for the physicals, um, do they, [LIPSMACK] like, what would disqualify a person?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, [MN] very little.  Uh, you know, I mean, they -- the complete physical, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- would guarantee that, you know, they check your lungs, they check, I mean, to make sure that you're physically fit to handle the job.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, uh, make sure there's -- and I don't know for sure any pre existing conditions or something [NOISE] that could harm you --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- or, you know, or prevent you from doing your job.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, they've done --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- blood tests, they do chest xrays, you know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the usual stuff.
R:  Mm.  Okay.  That's cool.  So, how many, like, times have you been tested in that job?  Just once?  Or have you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been tested for several jobs? 
L:  Uh, no.  No.  No.  No.  I've actually never had to.  Um --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I've gotten tested for [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] three or four jobs that I've applied for and that was part of the physical process, you know, the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ph- -- [MN] which w- -- is absolutely no issue whatsoever.
R:  Yeah, I see.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, did -- did it have, like, zero tolerance for, um, any traced drugs or any just, like -- 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- like --
L:  Um --
R:  -- a little weed is okay, or --
L:  I -- it all depended on the situation.  If you were putting yourself in immediate jeopardy --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- most of the time what the -- what the company did was sent your for counseling and -- and suspended you.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And, you know, and th- they tried to work with you on it.
R:  I see.  [inaudible] Okay, mm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Another phone call?
L:  No, no, no.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Just another phone.  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay, Um, okay what else can we talk about?  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, I [MN], can they [MN], um, do you think using, um, drug, like, testing p- -- their people for drugs, do you think it can, like, be used against them in any way?  Do you think people would, like, a- abuse that power in any way?
L:  Um, if it's a true professional, no.  I'm sure in the industry there have got to be some people that take it as a power trip.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  But basically, all it is is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, I mean, somebody requesting it and somebody's doing a lab test; that's all.  [NOISE] And [several inaudible words] it's all done anonymously.
R:  I see.  So, it's very --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] what's the word?  It's very, like, confidential and it's very, like, closed. 
L:  It's totally -- yes, It's totally confidential.  The only people that know it's being done are the testee and the tester.  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  How long does the testing take?
L:  Um, depends on, you know, how -- how the company has it set up.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Couple of days to get a report back.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] The drugs last in your system for a couple of days also.
R:  Mm.  W- well, I never understood, like, you know, people that say, "Oh, it's an invasion of privacy".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Why, um, what -- what's your opinion on that?  Like, why would they say that?  Do you think it's because they are drug users themselves?
L:  Um, I m sure some are.  But some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just feel that no, it is an invasion of privacy.  And it's nobody's business but their own.  And they don't want to be tested.  That, you know, that's -- that's their opinion.  Mine, I have nothing -- I couldn't care less.  [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You want to test me, that's absolutely fine because liter- -- like I said, I have nothing to hide.
R:  I see.  So, it's -- it's totally legal to, um, to do the drug testing right now, right?  But -- 
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Is it -- it's totally legal to require a te- --
