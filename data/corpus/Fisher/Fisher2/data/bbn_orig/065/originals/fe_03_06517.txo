R:  Hello?
L:  [SIGH] Hi.  Ah --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- my na- -- my name's Sharon.  I'm ah, from Kentucky.
R:  Hi, I'm Yvette, I'm from, ah, New Jersey actually.  How are --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you?
L:  Oh, pretty good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You enjoying the weekend?
R:  Yeah, well, so, not too good of a weekend since it's raining.
L:  Oh, yeah, you all -- we -- we've had it down here but this weekend's kinda pretty.
R:  Oh well, we st- --
L:  So.
R:  -- we're still looking for the good weather, just hasn't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- come -- it hasn't come in yet.  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  Uh, we've had tornados and everything, but --
R:  Whoa.  [MN]
L:  -- and it [MN] we're -- we're -- this weekend's pretty nice so I just appreciate what I get.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, that's very true.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- so do you, um -- do you work?
R:  Yes I do.  I'm a nurse.
L:  Do they drug -- oh, you're a nurse --
R:  Yes, I'm a nurse.
L:  -- well then, drug testing's probably ah -- you probably have some pretty strong [NOISE] feelings o- on that, one way or another.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I do, I personally believe that, you know, it's -- it's not a violation of a person's ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, privacy or anything like that, because you know, [MN] I feel -- let's say if I was an employer, I would like to know.  I mean if somebody has a -- a -- a drug problem, you know, previous past, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right, I believe that it's not an intrusion.  [SIGH] How do you feel?
L:  Yeah I don't -- well I don't -- I don't believe it is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- either, because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I believe your employees' --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, safety --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I believe your employees' --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- safety's, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more important.  [SIGH] Ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've -- I worked at a factory for thirty years and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah -- and ah, we would know of some, [NOISE] and they'd be on uh tow motors.
R:  Right.
L:  And ah, end- -- and ah not -- not only endangering themselves but endangering [NOISE] us.
R:  That's true.
L:  Um, because we were unionized, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, we'd be in s- -- we'd be in trouble if we'd turn 'em in.  [SIGH] So ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've seen that side of it, ah, [SIGH] um where you're endangering everybody.
R:  Yeah, that's true and, like I said, it's um -- like you said you would get in trouble if you were to -- to um, you know turn somebody in.  I mean, I think you would be doing it, you know, for that person's safety, [NOISE] as well as all others.  I mean that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- person [SIGH] could have a problem and really not realize it, because you know I, being a nurse, know that, you know, [SIGH] everybody feels that more -- people who do drugs you know, feel ah, listen I- I've been, you know the m- -- we make a fun motto which is, you know, "Hey, I've been doing it for twenty years and I'm not hooked" you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well -- you know if you've been doing it that --
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  -- [LAUGH] many years.
L:  Or I'd do it morning, noon and night.
R:  Yeah, you know like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- people who get in cars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with the marijuana and they was like all, "Oh, I would never get into a car being high" you know, and or -- or like drinking, "I would never get into a car drunk".  But you know, um, people who tell me that, I was like, "Really?"  Do you really think if these people knew, actually were conscious and knew that they were doing drugs or that they were high or they were drunk, they would actually get into a car?  Of course they wouldn't.  I mean common sense, common knowledge would tell you, "No, don't do it" but --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- when -- when you're drunk or high, you don't know, you think you have it under control, you know, you --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- just think you do, and you know, and you don't, that's why they don't think it's -- you know, it's a problem.  [SIGH] But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like I said, if I -- you know, if I ran a large company, I would definitely -- you know my thing is if --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you want the job, you know, you wouldn't find it as an intrusion.  [MN]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, and then look at your pilots, your bus drivers, your --
R:  Yep --
L:  -- uh --
R:  -- right.
L:  -- uh -- um, any -- anybody that's on the road --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a company, truck -- truck drivers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so on and so forth; I mean, [SIGH] ah train operators, that's a service to the public, period.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Um, whether it protects the company as much as it's a service to everybody.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  No doubt, you know, all over, I think.  [SIGH] Ah, what was it, not very long ago, they f- -- um, caught a pilot going on --
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  -- a plane that was high and um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I can't believe that they don't random [MN] -- I -- I -- I believe it should be random [NOISE] checking so that they can't or have ex- -- ah -- extremely strong suspicion and be able to prove it so that they -- companies some- sometimes use um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the rules against someone they'd really ha- -- got it in for, and I think that should be, you know, really protected.
R:  Right.
L:  That's [SIGH] that part of it, but that -- I believe the guidelines can be put in to protect everybody.
R:  Right, [MN] [NOISE]
L:  Ah --
R:  Same way as a convict, wo- -- you know, would be -- they -- they agree to or they, you know, have a choice as who the- -- upon release, they -- every six months -- three months, every visit that they go to the probation officer, they have to get a urine sample.  You know people --
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  -- just [several inaudible words] -- yes, to -- that -- that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to state whether they're still doing drugs or they're under the influence of drugs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, that's the key, you know to make sure that that person's on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the right track and you know, everything's going well, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But then, if they violate that, you know, that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the same thing, they're out there -- they're out in the public, you know whether they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- get a job as a factory worker, bus driver.  [SIGH] You know, I personally have children.  I don't think that I want, um, you know, to even think that the person driving the bus, you know, has a drug --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- problem.
L:  That's unreal, you know?  [SIGH] Or even -- even --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even if it's not what, quote unquote problem --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- if um -- if they're high on marijuana and -- and driving a bus --
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, and ah, so many ah -- from what I -- I don't know -- from what I hear, a lot of the marijuana people feel that that's not a drug because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, not really a drug, and like you said, "I've been doing it for twenty years".  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yeah exactly.
L:  And um -- and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, and yet[?] without random drug testing, that's kinda hard to detect that is --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah I'm -- I assume, from what I've heard, read really, I mean you know, [SIGH] it's a little bit harder to detect that without a drug test though.
R:  Right, that's very true.
L:  I think, you know, 'cause --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] I know one time years ago someone told me, "Boy, your eyes are red, what've you been on?" and I have allergies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean I [LAUGH] -- you know, [SIGH] so that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- why I'm going on -- it's a little bit -- someone said well you can tell by someone's eyes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't think you necessarily can.
R:  Yes, you can't [NOISE] --
L:  I don't know, you'd know more about that then me.
R:  Well, it's --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- it's to a point.  I mean if the person's ah, you know, excessive use, yeah probably, but you know it all depends basically on the drug that's being used.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, marijuana yes, because they don't -- one of the things is that it makes you very tired.  One of the other drugs makes you hyper, so you can't tell.
L:  [NOISE]  Is that right, marijuana makes you tired?
R:  Yeah, makes me -- from what I hear --
L:  Then why would you do it?
R:  You know what it's just -- you what it -- it gives them ah, like a, what is it -- um -- [LIPSMACK] what is it called?  Um, just it's -- it's like a high --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a high feeling, you know +euphoria it's -- it's just a high feeling.
L:  Yeah, I don't -- yeah I see what you're saying but, [SIGH] to me, [MN] if I -- I don't do -- I don't do any thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but if I was gonna do it [LAUGH] I'd want more energy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well you know what I guess they feel it's -- you know it's to mellow them out.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, it's to mellow them out, but you know, basically it puts you to sleep.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I've worked in a drug institute also and so I -- you know, it's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, back in the days and, you know I sit there and say, "Well, why would you do that?" and they're like, "Oh well, you got a high then and when you're coming down you get sleepy, tired whatever" you know.  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, my thing is, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you're gonna -- if you're gonna work, you should be subjected to it, you know, especially if you're gonna --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- work with the public, you know being a nurse --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in hospital, like you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stated, you know, factories especially working heavy machiner- machinery.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, just to take --
L:  Oh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- some Nyquil is -- is -- is ho- -- you know [MN] -- they automatically recommend, "Do not work heavy machinery".  Take anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for pain, same thing.
L:  Yeah, do not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- operate heavy machinery [NOISE] --
R:  Right -- right, do not drive a vehicle, you know, it's -- it -- it just --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- adjusts[?] your -- your -- your motor skills, basically your motor skills, if you can't react fast enough, [NOISE] you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not gonna help you, you know, it's not gonna get you out of situation which you [SIGH] otherwise wouldn't have been in if you would have, you know, been the same --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- not high.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, had all your, uh, reflexes --
R:  Right --
L:  -- [NOISE] [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- exactly, mhm.
L:  -- or whatever.  I agree, [SIGH] yeah, I -- I um, you know, like I said, I thi- -- I think it can be done on, um, unbiased basis --
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, and ah, isn't it -- it's -- it's getting more and more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I believe isn't it getting more and more um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well spread where they do drug tests or --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the companies are, more and more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on a random basis, drug testing?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] I'd -- I'd -- you know, I'd -- [SIGH] and the medical professionals --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- definitely should be a pa- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause they -- the doctors not -- not nurses, I know you all don't really have access to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] drugs, but ah, doctors so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I know, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you read --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about doctors being --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hooked.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  'Cause they do -- they do -- they do, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- work such a strenuous --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, shifts and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hours.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But ah, and then ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's like the doctors don't want to squeal on the doctors --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] and so, I think -- I think, you know I think hospitals ought to test the f- -- doctors before they're [SIGH] um, allowed to have their --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- privileges to practice medicine in the hospitals even.
R:  Yeah, that's correct, that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very true, some of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do, some of them don't.  Nurses also have [SIGH] access to drugs, just as much as --
L:  Oh is that --
R:  -- as doctors, and you know, 'cause you know it all depends if they work in a private facility they have more access to it then they do, [SIGH] you know, in a hospital, but you still have access to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But like I said it ju- -- it should be um -- it should be -- should be mandated to be drug tested --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?  It's not an invasion of everybod- -- anybody's privacy.  What do you have to hide, basically?
L:  Exactly --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- exactly, it's ah, if you're not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing drugs, what -- what makes the difference if --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they take a urine test or however they do it, or blood or whatever.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what's the big deal, other than [SIGH] ah, people that are paranoid have um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have this feeling, you know, "Well, that's wha- -- it starts there and then where's it go from there?" but --
R:  Right, mhm.
L:  -- I've heard that, [SIGH] but ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, I [SIGH] -- they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you don't -- the government tells you you have to ha- -- wear seatbelts for your safety.
R:  All right, mhm.
L:  Ah, so you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] And it's illegal not to in the state of Kentucky, which is okay, but yet why shouldn't it be -- why shouldn't they be able to test you for drugs too though?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I -- I believe -- I -- I'm strong [LAUGH] I strongly believe they should be able to, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for ah, public safety and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I know we -- we had a gentleman down here, ah, a policeman shot him --
