R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How's it going?
L:  How's it going?
R:  Hi, I'm Jeffrey.
L:  I'm Laha[?].
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH].
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from New York City.
R:  New York City?
L:  From Queens.  How about you?
R:  Well, I'm calling from, uh, Santa Monica, California, Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, sweet.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  That's -- I mean, I'm from -- I'm from the Bay, originally.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, Northern Cali.  Yeah.  
R:  Cool. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  San Francisco, huh?
L:  Yeah.  God, I miss that place.  Yep.  Basically, Oakland and Berkley and --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  I went to school out there and grew up out there.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Yeah.  I hear you guys are having the best weather.  Meanwhile, in New York which is supposed to be burning hot right now, is raining.  All rain.
R:  Yeah.  That's okay.  I mean, it's not --
L:  I'm a little jealous.
R:  It's kinda overcast, though, but that's the only thing.
L:  I see.  So, I know very little about this topic, 'cause I don't --
R:  I know.  That's what I was going to say.  I know very little about the --
L:  That's weird.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I've, um --
R:  That's okay.  We can talk about something else.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  You know, we can talk about whatever.  But, yeah, I haven't watched any -- I'm trying to think of -- and I -- I swapped over because I was on the line when the thing called me.
R:  Mhm?
L:  So, I had to swap over for a second.  So I missed, but it's basically criminal -- televised criminal trials, right?  
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  And --
R:  You know, that's really funny --
L:  And what we think about it.
R:  -- because this is their second time today calling me.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  That's kind of odd.  They usually don't --
L:  That's great.  Ho- how many times total have you been called?
R:  Well, I've been called twice.
L:  Okay.  Right.  Okay.
R:  Um, earlier today, and then a couple of days ago.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, this is my third call, so I think this is my last call.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Now, can you do this afterwards --
L:  I'm actually flying out of the country tomorrow, so I'm like, okay, I'll take this call real quick.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Where are you going?
L:  I'm going to Mexico.
R:  Cool.  [inaudible]?
L:  Yeah.  No, no.  I'm going to Guadalajara.
R:  Oh, cool.  I've been --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to Acapulco.
L:  Nice.  Did you like it?
R:  Yeah.  It's totally cool.
L:  Sweet.
R:  I had a good time.
L:  Yeah.  I'm sure.  It's a great place.  Okay, criminal trials, sorry.
R:  Okay.  Okay, okay, okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Um -- what about --
L:  Okay --
R:  -- what's that guy's name?  That actor?  The one that was -- Robert Blake.  Did you see anything about that one?
L:  What was that?
R:  That Robert Blake, the baretta?  
L:  No idea.
R:  That trial, the one that -- the guy that shot his, uh --
L:  I feel like I should know, but --
R:  Uh, what about, uh, Robert Downey Junior?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Did you watch that, though?
R:  A little bit.  I didn't see a whole lot.  I just heard -- it's in bits and pieces of, you know, what was going on and stuff.
L:  I guess it's just the whole id- idea of televised trials is weird to me.  Like, I'm, uh, all for, you know, public knowledge and information, but it just seems kind of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, kinda private, you know?
R:  It's funny.  It's funny, though, that they're like [LAUGH] they're asking us about these subjects, because I don't really -- I really don't watch TV.  I mean, I watch TV, but I mean, I don't watch, like, the news a lot or, like, trials.
L:  Right.  No.
R:  I don't get into that.  It's like it's really funny that's the subject.  [LAUGH].  The worst.
L:  Yeah.  No, they are the worst.  The other time I had, um, what's it called?  Ah.  Oh, my God, I can't -- oh, uh, pets.  Okay.  Well, that was a -- I guess something.  Um, and then the time before that, it was variety TV which I --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- hate to no end. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's just me.  Most people like it.
R:  Well, this first lady that I talked to, she said that, um, it was uh, I think it was on food.
L:  Food.  That's a great subject for me.
R:  Isn't it?  I mean, you could talk, like, about that, like, all the time. 
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] like all day or something.  
L:  All day.  Mm.  
R:  Yep.
L:  Well, criminal trials.  I don't know, maybe I should start watching them because I'm in law school now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just finished --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- my first year and --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- I'm in -- yeah, maybe doing some defense stuff, so --
R:  I just got out of college myself.
L:  What did you study?
R:  Um, psychology, believe it or not?  [LAUGH].
L:  Psychology.  Nice.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Are you -- so you just finished grad or undergrad or --
R:  No.  Actually, you know, I'm not finished yet.  I'm in my --
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm in my third year.
L:  Of?
R:  So, but um --
L:  Of undergrad? 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Or grad?  Okay.  
R:  And um, we just --
L:  Where do you go to school?
R:  UCLA.  
L:  Oh, okay.  Cool.
R:  And I just got out, um, what, it's Friday --
L:  That's exciting
R:  -- was my last day.  Yep, Friday was my last day.
L:  Yeah.  I'm pretty used to it.  I just finished my first year of law school which is, like, something, you know?  It's a part of the way through.
R:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.  
L:  A third of the way. 
R:  Wow.  
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.
R:  That's cool.
L:  It's time to take a vacation and have a great summer and --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- come back to it all.  Um, oh my God, I have nothing to say on this topic.
R:  Do yo- do you, um --
L:  Um --
R:  Do you, uh, let's see.  Do you go out a lot?
L:  I think -- um, sometimes.  No, because I'm a law student.  So I don't really --
R:  Oh, you don't party --
L:  I'm in --
R:  -- like, you know, you're not --
L:  No.  Please. 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  No.  Ain't nobody got no time for that.
R:  [MN].
L:  That wa- that was -- that was, if anything, more undergrad.
R:  That's where I get in trouble.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Like going, you know, partying with your friends and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Take over the weekends.  
L:  Mhm.  You go out a lot?
R:  Um, just on the weekends, like you know, I can't really -- can't go out during the week when I go to school, but you know, on the weekends is usually when I go out.
L:  Yeah.  I wan- I feel like I'm in New York City where there's all this stuff happening, but -- and I'm right here, but I can't really touch it, you know?
R:  God, there's tons of things --
L:  Like seeing -- 
R:  -- there.
L:  Seeing something you can't touch.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, but you ca- it's kinda like a trap.  Like, you just really -- I think for a -- your first year of law school is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- particularly, like, you just -- the only way to survive it is just to -- just ignore everything, from news to world events, to you know --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Especially world events for me because I'm normally very up on all that stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what do you want to do, after school?
R:  Um, I'm not really quite sure yet.  I'm like, taking like a bunch of classes and, you know, um [MN] I've -- I've got, like, a few things on hand that I kinda want to do.  I kinda wanna, um, you know, maybe go into computers, maybe a computer engineer or -- or maybe own my own business.
L:  Right.  Nice. 
R:  Um, uh, could lead to a doctor, maybe.  [LAUGH].  I don't know.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH].
R:  Don't know.
L:  That's all over the place.  So, let's talk about at least, um, like just the concept of pu- putting a -- somebody's criminal trial on television.
R:  Criminal trial.  Um --
L:  You know, like, it's like their private trial.  They could be put away for years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and years and here it is, public entertainment for people, you know?
R:  Yep.
L:  I don't know.  I don't know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I don't know how I feel about that.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It's not -- I don't think they should be secret and hidden --
R:  I --
L:  -- but it's kinda weird.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It's like your --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  -- life and your put on the stand and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's all televised for somebody else's pure entertainment.
R:  God, I know.  I couldn't imagine being in that situation, where --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like media all over the place, all over you.  I mean, it's -- [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Especially this country's media --
R:  It's pretty bizarre.
L:  -- which is, like, out of control.
R:  Oh, the media is like totally, totally out of control here.
L:  And reaches -- yeah, yeah, yeah. 
R:  It's just unbelievable here.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But um --
L:  Think OJs trial was the closest one that I ever, like, the -- the most I ever watched, and I didn't even watch that too much.
R:  Yeah.  I think that was probably the onlyist trial that I actually -- I mean, watched, you know?
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  'Cause it was -- it was so -- I don't know, it was just really out there.  You know, for you to see.  You couldn't escape it.  [LAUGH].  Practically, I mean, it was on every channel here.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So --
L:  I know.  
R:  It was, uh --
L:  Where did you, um, grow up?
R:  Um, actually I grew up here.  
L:  Cool.
R:  I grew up here.
L:  That's so Cal kid, huh?
R:  Yep.  So Cal.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So Cal.  [LAUGH].
L:  Good stuff.  Good stuff.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Twenty four.
R:  Oh, wow.  A --
L:  And you?
R:  Twenty.  
L:  Twenty?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I'm just kidding.
R:  What's the "oh" for?
L:  That's cool.  That's cool.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I look about twenty. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Mm. 
L:  I always get that, but um -- okay.  Criminal trials.  Uh, wow.  That's amazing.  I don't think I've ever had nothing to say about that.  
R:  Uh --
L:  Um, I don't know, I'm just very wary of television altogether.  I mean --
R:  I know.
L:  Mostly a waste of time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And anything that used to be something is no longer.  Like, it's just all kinda trash.  So --
R:  Have you -- have you watched that American Idol thing?  
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that show makes me so sick.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  It's so not interesting.  Like, they pick the most boring -- it's like a mainstream --
R:  I know.
L:  -- dumb arse people and they expect us to -- and people fall for it.  They're like, interested.  Like, they --
R:  I know.
L:  -- stop their lives to watch these people live their fake lives.  That's phenomenal --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- to me, you know? 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's really something.
R:  It's a lot of bull shit. 
L:  Yeah.  Just reality television altogether too is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  I only watch television when I have to.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  When there's nothing else --
L:  Actually --
R:  -- to do.
L:  -- I don't even -- I don't have a television.  Huh.
R:  You don't?  [LAUGH].
L:  No, which is great.  I mean, God, if you could ever try that in some point in your life --
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  -- you really should, because it's a whole different life.  
R:  Well, in New York --
L:  Really --
R:  -- you don't really need a television anyway.
L:  You don't really need a television, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But I mean --
