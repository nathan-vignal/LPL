L:  Hi, this is Lisa.
R:  Hi, this is Julie.
L:  Hi, Julie.  Um, well you know what, I- I've never really thought about it too much, as far as watching trials on TV, especially high profile ones, have you?
R:  Uh, um, [LIPSMACK] well, um in light of OJ Simpson, yeah I've -- I've thought about it a little bit.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Um, have you watched any?
L:  [SIGH] No, I can't say I have, just um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- anything that was picked up by --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- newspapers or newspapers -- news, the TV news, [SIGH] but I really -- I don't have the time for that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  You know, and I'm just -- you know if I'm watching TV, I want to be entertained --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I don't find that to be like, really entertaining.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, ye- -- I would agree with you and I think um, it's -- it's part of that kind of reality TV fad that's going on --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and um, [MN] I do think that it also, um, sways the public's opinion as well and um, you know, especially like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, just going back to the whole --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- OJ thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, I probably watched one, um, and then I definitely, you know, like maybe one [NOISE] trial.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and then I watched one towar- -- obviously I watched the last one with the hearing, with the verdict --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  Everybody saw -- everybody heard that, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I have to say, you know, [MN] it was pretty obvious what the verdict was gonna be, even before it was read, and that was just based on, you know, public opinion.  So I do think, in a way, you know, that that's -- I dunno, I -- I think it was um  I don't wanna say fixed, but I do think, um, public opinion had -- had a valid argument for that particular case.
L:  So, you think it had an impact, basically, the public opinion?
R:  Well --
L:  The way --
R:  -- yeah, I mean it was gonna be riots in the street or let OJ go.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know 
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, do you think that that's the case with other televised trials too, or -- or just the high profile ones?
R:  Um, mm, that's a really good question.  Probably -- probably just the high profile ones, because, um, I think that's what people get, um, [LIPSMACK] interested in.  It gets --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- more -- more viewers if you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- will.  I mean like, the next high -- high profile tro- -- ah, trial for example, will be the Laci Peterson trial, if in fact it does go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- televised, right?  They're still trying to decide, right?
L:  Right, I think so.
R:  [MN] So, um --
L:  Yeah and that --
R:  -- but that of course, I mean, m- majority of people already think he's guilty, so [NOISE] I don't know if that would make a difference --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know what I mean?  If it al- -- if it is televised or not, because I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- think people, again, have already made up their mind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um -- and, ah [LAUGH] you know, unless there's gonna be some [SIGH] riots in the street, I really don't think, you know, [SIGH] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think it's gonna make a difference either way with the partic- -- with that particular trial --
L:  Yeah, with that --
R:  -- the Laci Peterson.
L:  -- trial, yeah. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] But I -- you know, I -- I kinda wonder, now that we're talking about it and now that I'm thinking about it a little bit is, you know, does it make us better citizens to watch these things or does it actually make us more jaded as, you know, just a population?
R:  Right, um --
L:  Or do -- do we -- do we believe in what we see, or -- or do we -- you know, do we become cynical because of what we see?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I -- I haven't had a lot of dealings with courts personally, I've never actually had jury duty, I've been called several times but I've actually never been chosen.  [SIGH] So I really have, you know, a very limited scope as a frame of reference and, you know, if there [SIGH] -- if these are being put out there on TV, [SIGH] are the attorneys changing the way they're trying cases, are judges changing the way they interpret rules, you know, how -- how are things affected by -- by being on TV?  By the possibility --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of gaining this notoriety, this celebrity?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so I --
R:  Well, I think it -- yeah, I mean it definitely becomes almost like a marketing scheme, you know what I mean?  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, "Well, let's -- let's put him in light colors, so that he appears innocent and let's, you know -- you know, have his hair be this certain way so that [SIGH] you know, he --" you know, it's just -- it's -- it's such a marketing scheme --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- whenever s- -- whenever anything is visual and it goes to the public, there is so much marketing --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- behind that.
L:  Very true.
R:  It -- that it's so -- it's -- it's -- it's false, it's fake, you know?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, um --
L:  So, then are people getting fair trials?  Like, by having it on TV?
R:  Um, my opinion is n- no.  It's not going to always be fair.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Period.  Um, and especially if it is something that is -- has um -- especially has a -- ah -- a racial, um -- um kind of undertone, I definitely think it will not be fair [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I think it won't be fair when um, [MN] -- when you know, again people have already made up their mind even before --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even goes on television, so that -- and that has to do with media already, I mean that hasn't even gone on -- that's just media that has been covered already.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, [MN] you know, um, whatever Mr Peterson -- you know, did he do it, did he -- did he not do it?  Well, [SIGH] at this point, you know, [LAUGH] it -- it [SIGH] -- from all the media coverage, you know, it looks like he did it --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and so, I don't know if um -- I don't know if having his trial go on TV will necessarily make it any more fair.  I think [SIGH] you know, um, [MN] I -- y- -- obviously there are things that -- that -- the ah -- the -- [LIPSMACK] the attorneys and the court systems know -- the DA knows and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as well as um, you know -- [SIGH] they know -- they know certain things they're not sharing with us, is what I'm trying to say.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, when they share that with us, then we'll make -- be able to make an educated, you know, opinion.  [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um, that's another thing too, is what's held back.  So, I think there's a lot of evidence and things that are held back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we as the consumer are not seeing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] so that's also the flip to it, so 
L:  Right, right.  But you know it's -- it's so interesting because you used the term consumer and that's what we've become; we- we're just consumers of this.  This is just like another, as you said before, reality TV show and, [SIGH] it's probably like the +precursor to all of these reality TV type shows, if you think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about it and, of course, you know, obviously more real than anything else that gets put on, but I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I just, you know -- I don't think that [LIPSMACK] -- that people will get fair trials.  I also think it leaves open, um, a lot more for appeal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after the verdicts have come down, and that also can be used because public opinion can be used based on the response of the televised trial.  And -- and I think it's actually diluting our justice --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- system, now that I'm thinking about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and -- and honestly I really haven't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- thought about it before --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this, so 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But yeah, I -- I think it probably does --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- serve to dilute the justice system because we have people who have maybe political aspirations, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, where we have judges and -- and attorneys who want to go on and this can be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a forum for them.  And it --
R:  Everybody has an agenda.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Everybody.
L:  Exactly. [NOISE] 
R:  You know, [COUGH] whether it's the lawyer representing that -- that wants to be the hottest lawyer, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, in the world, then that's their -- that's their fifteen minutes of fame, you know, they're gonna do what they need to do to, you know, make themselves -- to get what they want --
L:  Right --
R:  -- whatever that is.
L:  -- exactly.  Yeah.  Do you think TV is -- is -- allows that to happen better or -- or facilitates it in any way?
R:  Oh, I think TV is the -- the -- is the most well received w- -- ah, [NOISE] you know, I mean, every household usually has one, um, whether --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're -- you're -- you're poor, you're middle class or you're -- you're high class, [MN] everybody has usually access to a TV, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] I definitely think that that would be the most inf- --
