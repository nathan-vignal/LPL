L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH] --
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  I thought I was gonna sit here for a few minutes while they searched for someone else [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, they're -- yeah, they called me, and they said they were gonna search for somebody, so [NOISE] --
R:  So, they must have found you first.
L:  Yeah.  Well, this is my first -- my [inaudible] to get to do this, so --
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I've done it one other time and I really enjoyed it actually.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  
R:  So, my name is Brooke [LIPSMACK].
L:  And my name is Karen.
R:  Karen.  And where are you?
L:  I'm in Columbus, Ohio.
R:  Uh-huh.  I'm in a small town in the foothills of the Sierras in northern California.
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Where it's a beautiful, nearly summer evening [LAUGH].
L:  It's kinda chilly here [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  So ... 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, so, it sounds like we're supposed to spend a fair amount -- or most of the time talking about the subject.  I'm not quite sure why, but, um --
L:  Dr- drug -- drug testing?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  It doesn't seem to me as controversial as some of the other issues that they have, but, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] it -- and to my way of thinking, I think drug testing is really important.
L:  Oh, I do too, because I've worked all my life, and, uh, [MN] I think it -- especially on the job, because y- you know, there's a -- you know, you could get hurt, uh, cause someone else to get hurt [SIGH].  You know, I worked in a factory for many years --
R:  Mm, uh-huh.
L:  -- and you have to be right on top of things.  You can't be on, you know, you know, high or, uh, whatever these kids do, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Nowadays, but, you know, it's not so much kids any more, it's older adults too.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Well, I -- I was, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- married to a man for a number of years who was hooked on painkillers because he'd had five back surgeries, and --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- so it isn't just recreational drugs that are a problem.  
L:  That's true, that's true.  
R:  It's, uh --
L:  And -- and, well, I had to take, uh [LIPSMACK], what do you call -- muscle relaxers there for a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I got hurt in my back real bad once in the factory.  And they don't -- you know, you don't think right, you don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're -- you know, they're not very good [SIGH].
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Especially when you're in a job or -- and I don't think -- to me, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy.  In my opinion about it, I think, you know, I -- you know, I think it should be done.  If I owned a company or some -- I -- I would, you know, insist it be done before I hired anybody, for the simple fact I want, you know, my -- my company to run smoothly.  I don't want nobody to be hurt or anything.
R:  I agree.  I mean I do -- I feel strongly about other privacy issues --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. 
R:  -- but I feel like, um, it's really important to know if people are taking drugs, because it not only affects them but the people around them and, um, people who are -- who are hooked on various kinds of drugs, they do need help.  
L:  Yeah, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And, um, so, especially if there's something in place where they can get the help they need if they're identified --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- after they've been on the job, if they're identified as -- as, uh, using drugs.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Well, you know, where I worked at, we, uh -- I drove a tow motor.  And a lot of people, you know, that was a -- a main way to get -- move our parts around and everything and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- tho- those things can be very dangerous too.  And then we had presses.  And I know a gentleman, now he wasn't on drugs, but he did get his -- he was fine, but he did, uh, m- make a mistake and h- ha- had four of his fingers cut off.  
R:  Ay.
L:  The press came down on him.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] So, I can imagine if someone's on drugs, they -- they're not gonna be as careful as, I feel, as someone that -- that's not, you know [NOISE].
R:  They just don't have the capacity, either the thinking capacity or the motor capacity.
L:  Exactly.  That's the same as alcohol too.  
R:  Mhm, right, right.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  I have, uh, my stepdaughter who has a -- her husband flies, actually, for Learjet, and she said the only thing they're allowed to take is [SIGH] motrin, because it doesn't seem to affect either their thinking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or their motor stuff, if they have pain.  I --
L:  Well, that's a good idea, you know. [NOISE]
R:  -- I thought it was interesting that they could take anything, but that tells --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- tells you how, um [MN], how many medications, uh, actually do affect your whole system.
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.  Well, I have a son that works at the post office, and, uh, you know, they drug test before yo- -- they let you know right, you know, before you're hired they're gonna drug test and they're gonna randomly drug test.  So, you know, I think too it's up to the individual, if they feel that's what they want to do, go ahead.  You know, my son don't take no drugs or anything, but [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they do all their employees that way.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I do know that, and wh- -- and they're -- I've -- I've worked -- I worked at J.C. Penney's for a while [SIGH], and, um, in the catalogue center, and they did the same thing.  They let you -- but they let you know up front.  And it's not like they walk up to you, "Hey, you gotta go take a drug --" you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, that's -- I don't feel it's an invasion of privacy for a simple fact.  You know ahead of time it's gonna happen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, uh -- you know, if -- if -- you know, if you're not doing anything wrong, then there should be nothing wrong with it.  You know --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  -- that's how I feel about it. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's interesting, uh, that the two -- two companies that you've worked for have it in place, and I don't know, I haven't checked, but I guess, probably --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, many, many companies do.  Maybe everybody does now [LAUGH].  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, years ago, yeah, years ago -- see, I'm forty eight now, and I worked -- I worked almost fifteen years in the factory --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it wasn't so bad back then, it wasn't, you know, mandatory to do anything like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it seems like, over the years, just about everybody's doing it now.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because there's so much -- so -- so much, you know, things going on nowadays, you know? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So --
L:  And I [MN] -- I mean, I would, I mean, [MN] to me it's not invasion of privacy, and, you know, and I feel if you're clean, you know, you shouldn't have a problem with it, you know?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  The only thing I can imagine is if there's some case where [MN] some of the testing isn't accurate or something, so somebody --
L:  Tr- --
R:  -- could be accused of s- something that they haven't been doing.
L:  Exactly.  That's true, that's true.
R:  But -- but I don't -- I don't know if that's the case with drug testing.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, you know, I've -- what -- [NOISE] from what my son's been telling -- here lately, that now they, uh, these big -- big, uh, manufacturers and companies are [MN] -- you know, they always do a pee test, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, sometimes, you know, you can -- I heard you can switch -- you know, take [inaudible] in and [several inaudible words] like, you know, you -- you did that, you know, if you're taking drugs or whatever.  And I've heard this has been happening, so what they're doing now is they're, uh, plucking couple of hairs out -- outta your head, and they can go back up to three months on that.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Whoa.
L:  To find out if you've ever, you know, been taking drugs.
R:  [SIGH] That --
L:  So, you can't -- you can't just, you know, switch hairs, you know, you gotta --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they take -- you sit there and they take 'em, they pluck your hairs and then they test 'em and it shows, you know, if -- if -- you been -- it can -- it can test you all the way back for, like, three months now. [NOISE]
R:  So, they do that before a person is hired --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- or after a person is hired?  Or [inaudible]?
L:  Uh, I don't know, um, if they actually do it before they're hired, uh, but some -- I think some companies, like General Motors in Nanceford[?], Ohio --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I know they do it, because, uh --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] my, uh, nephew's girlfriend, her father works there.  And they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they just started doing that recently, ah, because they -- you know, they -- they got, uh -- they found a lot of people inside the plant, you know, taking drugs and everything.  They had undercover police working there and -- and find out.  They were even selling outta there [LIPSMACK] --
R:  I'm not surprised. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, you know, bootleg liquor, all kinds of stuff, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK], yeah, she said now -- now they are taking the hair from the person [SIGH], that way they can -- they can test it up back to three months. [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  So, yeah, they do do it at General Motors now. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.  That -- that does feel like [MN] -- to me that fringes on, uh, a privacy issue.  I can under- -- uh [LIPSMACK], I can understand that the companies need to be safe, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, as far as I'm concerned, drugs are not a good idea, but if someone wanted to smoke pot on Friday night, and, uh, have it out of their system by the time they showed up at work -- I mean, I --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not -- I don't even know how long certain drugs last but --
L:  Well, it stays in your system for thirty days. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh. [COUGH]
L:  If -- if you smoke marijuana, it stays in your system for thirty days.
R:  But how long does it affect your functioning?
L:  Oh, well, [MN] yeah, that's true, but who knows if you're doing it every day?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Some people smoke it every day like cigarettes.
R:  Right.
L:  See, that's what the -- you know, that's what they worry about.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like you said, someone could get high on, you know, Friday night, and be sober, go back to work Monday.  But some people, you know, they're so used to smoking it, that you can't -- some people you can't even tell they're high, because they -- they do it all the time, you know?
R:  Right, right.
L:  And, so I think that's the main issue right there.  I mean, I understand what you're saying, because [SIGH], to each his own, you know.  Who am I to meddle in anybody's business?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, uh, [MN] I've never done drugs or anything, you know, it just wasn't, you know, I guess my thing.  I never hung out with, you know, people that did.  I'm not saying they're bad -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't get me wrong, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, because I know, uh -- and that's another thing.  Isn't -- isn't it out there in California, uh, they have prescription marijuana for people with cancer and things?
R:  Well, they try to [LAUGH].  Actually they --
L:  It didn't work?
R:  Uh, well, the federal government is coming in and trying to overrule the states --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  -- and the counties, but, actually the county where I used to live, Santa Cruz, the city council has actually supported the local people who are providing marijuana to, um --
