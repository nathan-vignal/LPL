L:  Hi I'm Vanessa.
R:  Hi I'm Melissa.
L:  Hi Melissa.
R:  How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yes I think divorce does have an impact on, um, family values and plus I believe that marriages are much different than they were -- but way back in the day. 
R:   Yeah definitely me too, um, -- um, just filling some water here in my glass but, um, yeah I definitely feel the same way.  My parents were divorced when I was a teenager so -- it kind of like in the middle of my life, um, it totally changed so, um, I kind of got to see what it was like on both sides and, um, [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah I think, um, so used to like seeing your parents together having them together and divorce is -- is a separation and definitely when you're a child it's very hard because not only -- you have to deal with your feelings you actually have to also deal with your parents feelings because then it's like you're in the middle of a tug of war you don't want to step on nobodies toes cause you love them both.
R:  Yeah for the kid you mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and it's hard on a family cause it takes its toll on everybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how did you -- how do you feel about the marriages nowadays?
R:  Um, yeah I do I guess just going through that experience and seeing the way meaning how high the divorce rate is, um, I don't know if I, um, think that highly of it anymore you know I think highly of it and I certainly would like to get married but, um, I don't necessarily believe that it is forever you know.
L:  I know not like it was like back in the day when we were growing up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You had more staying power but now it's -- it's just so much forgiveness and it's just so easy to just walk away.
R:  Hm.
L:  Than it is to just say yeah you know and make things work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But back then you had a lot of support from you know your family and being also back then you had other role models you can look too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But now it's like it's so easy to walk away.
R:  Yeah I think, um, the fact that it's so [inaudible] there's so many divorces that it just makes it easier for people to not worry about what other people will think if they get a divorce you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's so -- it's all over the place.  Where as I think you know fifty years ago or even twenty years ago, um, it wasn't quite you know so the divorce rate wasn't quite so high so people probably tried harder you know tried harder.
L:  I know. 
R:  To make the marriage work.
L:  Plus a divorced woman back then -- she was basically looked down at.
R:  Totally and like --
L:  But now it's, "Oh right she finally did it".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "She's divorced".  I'm serious it's like so many divorced clubs.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Celebrating this thing.
R:  But also, um, the other thing too is women's, um, in the workforce have like their, um, -- you know before you know fifty years ago or whatever women's, um, in the workplace they were really just limited to being secretaries or a teacher or you know something like that, where as now they are CEOs of companies and they're totally financially stable and independent so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're not as dependent on men anymore you know.
L:  Yeah but, um, so what are your values -- family values on like growing up with divorce and with a marriage -- I mean it's kind of tricky because did you wonder okay stay in it and be miserable, or get a divorce and it will take a toll on somebody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Either way it's kind of like you're stuck.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cause you're not happy. 
R:  But I was saying stay in it because at least your children -- if you have children now see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That you know when you work harder and you stick with it eventually it will work out --
R:  Yeah because it gives them a sense of stability too.
L:  Exactly yeah like they can always go somewhere and always come back knowing home is where home is.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Yeah cause, um, -- I don't know it just seem harder -- me my mother she never married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it was always a single family.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But still --
R:  How was that for you?
L:  For me I was used to it.
R:  Right.
L:  So I didn't like I didn't know anything else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But for now I'm married but so -- but now I'm being married I see a lot of things that I wasn't able -- our mother wasn't able to provide for me being single.
R:  Right. 
L:  So that gives me the strength to stick it out too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I can I know how it is from you know just been a single parent home far as there is lot of benefits from a married home.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Which I think now like if you're in a marriage -- if you are in a married home and you take a lot of that for granted then when you get married you're still going to like take it for granted because I don't think -- like a lot of people don't appreciate things.
R:  Right that's a good point.
L:  So it's like I mean but then like if you was in a married home and your parents got divorced then you wouldn't be so -- so quickly to get married and if you were married you'll be real hesitant to a divorce because you know from front end how it takes a toll on you or how it take a toll on you as far as your child so you'll understand what they're seeing and a lot of people are doing a divorce they don't -- I don't think -- think they like they really know the full picture you know.  Unless there is a situation when someone is being abused.
R:  Right yeah.
L:  You know but there's a lot of things you'd be surprised there is a lot of petty reasons why people get divorced now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You like, "Oh, my god you'll get a divorce for what?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, um, I know I've, um, it's just always interesting and surprising to hear about friends that are getting divorces just it's so sad you know because you have this little plan for your life and then totally changes.
L:  I know I guess it all depends on each situation is different you know I mean I know some people when one of their, um, the partners in the marriage like they might have to go to a drug rehab.
R:  Hm.
L:  And they still stick together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know or like --
R:  Well that makes sense because the partner that's in drug rehab is trying you know you know trying to change.
L:  Yeah but you know you have some people they're just like forget it he has -- he's got problems I got my own.
R:  And they don't want to deal.
L:  They're like I'm out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which I mean that's all and good because some people they just can't handle that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which me personally I don't think -- I don't think I have the strength to do it but you never know.
R:  Yeah I mean I don't -- I don't have that much experience with, um, people with drug addictions or anything but I mean I guess if I loved the person and I was --
L:  Yeah I mean it's -- it's hard to say oh no I couldn't do that.  You never know.
R:  You never know yeah.
L:  Yeah but I think now a days divorce is just so common.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's -- it's ridiculous and then they -- and then I mean it's like a divorce now is so cheap.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah well I'm in Phila- -- Philadelphia Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.
L:  And divorce costs about a hundred and something.
R:  Are you kidding?
L:  I am serious.
R:  Oh my god.
L:  They advertising it like --
R:  [SIGH] They advertise it?
L:  They advertise it.
R:  That's awful.
L:  So it's so -- so open it's so there so it's like oh come on like then but growing up to get a divorce you'd be talked about.  [inaudible]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now it's like, "Oh, okay".
R:  Yeah well that's -- I -- that's crazy they advertising that.
L:  Oh, yeah, they advertise it.
R:  But, um, so what's the divorce rate in Philadelphia?  Is it -- do you know is it different from the rest of the country? 
L:  Um, I don't -- I don't know the divorce rate but I know from like from just my -- from the people I know I would say probably like out of ten of my girlfriends probably only three to four is married.
R:  Okay.
L:  So it's not like -- it's not like it's a real issue to get married.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Because the first thing you want to get married I don't think people are respecting marriage.
R:  Maybe they just seem more cautious.  You know like they want to get it right.
L:  I don't think so.
R:  No.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think it is pretty much the old saying if you've got your milk why buy the cow?
R:  Yeah that's true.
L:  You know because a lot of girls are marrying and they have children and it's like, "How come you got married?" I don't know it's just
