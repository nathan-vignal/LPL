L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- Stephanie in Kansas City.
L:  Hi, Stephanie, this is Jackie and I'm in California.
R:  Hi, Jackie.
L:  Hi, good -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, well it's morning here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, same here, it's probably a --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- little early -- well I guess it's nine there, huh?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, so it's not too early.
L:  [SIGH] Um, gosh I -- you know I've never been -- ha- -- been ha- -- um -- [MN] actually had to be drug tested.  I've never had a job where I've had that done, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- y- you know I don't think it's a problem, but if they actually came and wanted to do it, I -- I don't know how I'd feel.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Right, well I know at the job that I have currently, and probably -- I'm try- -- I think that was the only job that, um, initially -- like part of the, ah, screening process when you get selected for the position, they make you -- it's not random, you know it's -- it's automatically, you are tested.  And then they tell you that there are cases where they can go through and randomly drug test you, but I don't know of any time that they've ever done that.  [SIGH] Um, it doesn't really bother m- -- I mean i- it's sort of an invasion of privacy but I guess it's their, you know -- it's their way of ensuring that they're getting the most out of their employees, you know what I mean?  Like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- making sure that -- that they're getting a hundred per cent of the employees', ah, concentration or you know, um, attitude and ah -- and just you -- you know what I mean.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah a- well --
R:  I guess I'm at a loss for words.
L:  -- you -- for some reason what comes to my mind are the pe- -- like pilots and ah, you know, the air traffic control and where you or --
R:  And truck drivers, and -- right.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] where you have other people's personal safety --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, in your hands.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I [MN] -- I'm kind of for that.  I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I am for that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I --
L:  Um --
R:  -- it's just like with the pilots recently that they've found, you know, to be drunk --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- legally drunk --
L:  Oh [NOISE] yeah.
R:  -- and that to me is --
L:  Gosh.
R:  -- very [SIGH] scary, you know, to think that these -- you know -- these are just the ones that they've caught.  How many of them have actually gone off and -- and flown ha- -- you know, hundreds of people across the country or even from city to city and been legally drunk --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  And -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's bad enough that people get caught just driving, you know, themselves across the country, but to think that they have all these people's lives in their hands, [SIGH] yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think it's -- I would think it's very important.
L:  Well, and -- and too, you know, along the same lines what you just said about the driving drunk, the people that are driving drunk, uh, they normally are hurting other people when they are in the accident.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Ah, I mean overall, they're -- ah they get in a wreck and of course it's a child or -- or -- or maybe that's just what we hear about, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, well it generally, I mean from [NOISE] -- from what I've heard or my experience of [NOISE] people that I've known that have had accidents and have been drinking, usually it's the people that have been drinking that survive or --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- because they're so relaxed or, you know -- or even on drugs or whatever, they -- you -- they are in a different mindset I guess than those who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- aren't, and the ones that aren't are -- end up the ones that die --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like you said.  [SIGH] So, [SIGH] yeah, I guess I would really think that it -- it's probably very important.  I guess in some positions like, [SIGH] you know, somebody serving up hamburgers or whatever, um, i- it's probably not in the company's best interest to drug test them, just because of the cost and, you know, the turnover rate between employees, I guess, you know.  [SIGH] Um I -- I -- I don't feel that it's any type of invasion of privacy.  You're the o- -- you know you're looking for employment and that company is supporting you and providing you with [SIGH] a job and with money and [SIGH] you know, it's -- it's their choice.  You know, you're giving --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yourself, you're basically selling yourself [NOISE] to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that company.
L:  Right and it [NOISE] --
R:  That's the way I look at it, so.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- what -- and the companies --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- are very up front about it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it -- I don't know um [MN] you ca- -- you don't -- can't determine what a person, [SIGH] you know, lifestyle choices are.  You know maybe the person --
R:  Right.
L:  -- isn't taking drugs when they -- when they apply for the job, maybe they become [SIGH] addicts or [MN] --
R:  Dependent --
L:  -- whatever --
R:  -- right.
L:  -- sp- -- but they -- they knew when they applied for the job that that could come up, so [MN] really it's in their best interests to get caught, that's what I think.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [COUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  Right.  
L:  So and -- and not --
R:  To avoid a problem later on.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I -- I had a friend that, um, [LIPSMACK] she was caught --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but she was like blatantly, ah, using drugs at --
R:  Right.
L:  -- work, and she was caught working for ch- -- working over at Gala Winery and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, that -- that was the best thing that could've happened to her.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] But, [MN] the drug testing invasion of privacy, I think we're gonna see more and more of what we, as Americans, consider [NOISE] [SIGH] invasion of -- of privacy with what's going on in the world.
R:  Oh definitely, with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the terrorism and ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] just everything all together --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, nothing [SIGH] -- I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't know, I guess it -- nothing is sacred to some points, but we all have to know what's going on around us, I guess you know, every --
L:  [SIGH] [MN] --
R:  -- all of our -- all of the people that we interact --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with are -- are p- -- are part --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of our environment, [SIGH] and it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably at our best interest, you know, to ensure that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, our environment is kept safe --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- in some way, shape or form.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, you d- -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you have some meth addict that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] maybe --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he does or maybe he doesn't have a job, but if he does have a job, you know, at least there's an extra [SIGH] step taken to keep, uh, the rest --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the people [MN] -- even if it's not just employees, it's the, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people around you too --
L:  The innocents.
R:  -- keep you safe.  Right.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  The innocent bystanders to be -- bystanders to be kept --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- safe, you know, from him losing his mind.  You know, like you said, it's probably the best thing that any- -- that could happen to any of them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is to, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have -- to have them get caught and realize that they have a problem and [SIGH] have it dealt with.  I mean, I know there are people that [SIGH] -- that are maybe recreational drug users and the whole marijuana thing, you know, is very controversial and um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, I guess [MN] a lot of people think, "Oh well, I'm not hurting anybody.  I'm hurting myself, and I don't do it, you know, when I'm at work" but how do you know?  You know, how --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- how is the company --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to know whether you are or whether you're not?
L:  [MN] Right, and the thing is, is I don't think anyone can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] -- I mean even if -- ho- -- it -- any type of studies, extensive studies, how can they really tell if it [SIGH] isn't going to affect your mindset over a long period of time, or even a short period of time?
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  There are all kinds of diseases --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- or um, you know, brain disorders --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like alzheimers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so on and so forth, they don't know where it came from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and this may be, you know, some kind of an [MN] -- some things --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- that they -- that they [NOISE] feel that they don't have an answer for, well we don't know what causes it.  Well, you know, there are a lot of hidden things in people's background, [SIGH] that --
L:  Oh yeah [LAUGH] exactly.
R:  -- you know, that may contribute to that, and of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- course they may or may not [MN] admit to it.
L:  [SIGH] Or they -- you -- they might not -- a person might not even think [MN] ah you know, ah, um, [LIPSMACK] -- think that it's in any way related.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't know, as far as the drug testing goes, if you -- if you wanna, [MN] you know, it's your -- like I said, your own personal choice I guess --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, [MN] there are --
R:  Well, if you go to work --
L:  -- consequences for -- for having personal choices too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, I mean --
L:  You know?
R:  -- if you -- if you decide that you want to go to work for somebody else -- you know, if you're self employed and you're --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you stay at home and you do whatever, then I guess that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your business, but if you are contract- -- you're contracting yourself out to other companies --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- [SIGH] you've basically sold yourself to them and you are their property, you know, so to say --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- you know, fo- -- during that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- period of time.  So yeah, I don't really find it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- an invasion of your privacy, they're all in your business anyway --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  [LAUGH]
L:   And I mean --
R:  When it comes to --
L:  -- that's exactly [LAUGH] right.
R:  -- health insurance [SIGH] -- like, they know everything about you because of your health insurance and your health records --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and they know everything about you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so what's one m- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- other thing?
L:  I don't know, maybe this is just my ignorance talking [NOISE] but it seems like that to me, just from what I've observed, the people that are [SIGH] [MN] kicking up the fuss, ah -- the people that ha- -- that don't do drugs don't have a problem with it.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] You know, and --
R:  Right, it's the ones that have something to hide.
L:  That's -- yeah, and I don't know, maybe that's a -- just a generality on my part.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  But ah --
R:  -- no, exactly.
L:  [SIGH] Who knows?  And, uh, I don't take drugs so if they wanna [NOISE] test me, go ahead.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, exactly, that's the -- that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my opinion, it's like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- "Go right ahead" you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't have any problem with it --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, [SIGH] so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I know that there have been people um that, I know who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when, you know random drug -- when they hear --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the whole, "Oh -- "
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- drug testing's coming around", [SIGH] you know they're the first ones to pipe up and go, "Oh, well I have a problem" --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, and then the whole employee --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- assistance comes into play and so on and so forth.  And then there's a lot of legal issues with that.  [SIGH] We had an employee that was, um, we -- I mean, we all knew he was a blatant alcoholic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, it was just obvious --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and when it came --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- time for lay offs at my company, [SIGH] he, you know, right around that time when rumors were flying that, "Oh --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- they're starting to pick who's gonna go and who's gonna stay".  Well, he was [SIGH] immediately, "I have a problem, I'm an alcoholic" and therefore, you know he --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sorta protected himself --
L:  Yeah, he didn't wanna --
R:  -- from getting --
L:  -- be uh held -- held accountable it sounds --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like.
R:  Right, so -- and they couldn't, [NOISE] you -- you know then he has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a leg to stand on [NOISE] if he was to get laid off --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- he could say, "Oh --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- well, I had a problem -- "
L:  Right, discrimination --
R:  "-- and I went to them and I've -- "
L:  -- mhm.
R:  "-- been discriminated against --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- because I admitted that I had a problem".
L:  Yeah and they --
R:  So it was really --
L:  -- and the --
R:  -- ironic.
L:  -- companies really have no recourse but to protect themselves now, it's just gotten really out of hand I think.
R:  Yeah, I think lawsuits are --
