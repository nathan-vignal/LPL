L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, this is Stacey.
L:  Oh, my name's Patty.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  [MN] Where're you from?
R:  I'm in New Jersey.  How about you?"
L:  Oh, I'm -- I'm in Florida.  [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow!
L:  Originally from New York but m- my nephews and nieces all live in Jersey.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know the area.
L:  Uh-huh.  Basically.  [MN] I lived in Clifton for a year.
R:  Oh, my God we were neighbors.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Anyway, uh -- 
L:  [MN] How do you feel about drug testing?  [MN] 
R:  Um, not -- well to be honest I'm not crazy about it unless, like, you're involved in the public safety.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, if you're a pilot or a bus driver it's one thing, but, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you're a secretary it's kinda silly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How about you?
L:  Well, I worked in a doctor's office and we had, um, [LIPSMACK] a couple of the file clerks and stuff and, uh, one of 'em was really bad.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, an addict?  Or ...
L:  Uh, I don't know but she ca- -- um, she was always high.
R:  Ooh.
L:  And we all knew it.  But, uh, she messed up a lot of files so --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Mm.
L:  -- you know, anything dealing with anything [MN] --
R:  I guess that would count for safety though, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not, um, I mean, I -- I'm a real estate agent so they don't test you for that.  But, um --
R:  Yeah.
L: The, um, when I -- well I'm a substitute teacher, which I haven't done yet but I've --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- been one for two years; I've never even called yet.  But --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- um, it -- they have too many of 'em I think.  But you had to go for drug testing for that and I could see that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because you're working with children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, in the school but both of the -- well most of the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- jobs are just like clerks and stuff really unless they work with something like medical stuff and I don't think so.
R:  Yeah.  You know, to me -- yeah, to me it's, like, un- unless there's some way to say this involves safety.  I mean, I worked in, you know, applied for a gig on Wall Street once --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what they told me was, it became standard practice because one very high up trader --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was an addict and was, you know, using his position as a way to get money for his -- his addiction.
L:  Right.
R:  Which wasn't cool and, okay, that's -- it's getting sort of a grey area there but all right I guess --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I can understand that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, they do it on everything -- I could see truck drivers, like, you said safety --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, but they're doing it down here on everything.  But, um --
R:  Yeah, here some communities are doing it for high school kids.
L:  Oh, I didn't hear that over here. 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- But, um --
R:  You have?  Or not -- have not?
L:  No.  I haven't heard that here.
R:  Yeah, I heard, I've hea- -- I think it's more in -- in, um, the mid west.
L:  Could be.
R:  But I'm hearing more and more schools picking it up.  And the worst part is that they're doing it and the kids who are going for extra curricular activities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, and, you know, who's going to go for that but the kids who are not messed up to begin with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and sort of discourages from, you know, trying to improve yourself or do something, you know, again, e- extra with your education.
L:  Well, what happens with the kids with the sports and stuff, that, uh, they tend to get into it, but usually it's not another kid who introduces them.  It's usually someone else; an adult.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, some of these coaches now are just really bad from the little leagues and the football coaches and stuff.  They want to win so badly they'll, you know --
R:  I heard about stimulants for kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  I -- I mean, I can understa- -- I can understand looking for steroids if they re, say if it's, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, a state run competition --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where you're qualifying for something.  But they're, you know, they're looking for your standard +illegal -- illegal drugs for even kids who go up for the band.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's -- that's -- again, it's going too far.  It's like there -- there are no degrees.  It's just -- we've got to stop this no matter what.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And -- 
L:  -- Well, we don't, um, I live in a little tiny tow- -- I live in Beverley Hills, Florida, which is about as tiny as they come.  
R:  Mm.
L:  But I used to live down in, um, it was more prevalent in, uh, Hillsborough and Marion County --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, even if you went for a temporary job, they --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- drug tested you, you know.
R:  Wow!
L:  But down here, um, when I wor- -- I -- I used to work for Hospice.  I got laid off in November, but when I worked --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- there, uh, the only thing they test you for was TB.  They didn't test anybody for drugs.
R:  Huh.
L:  But I think, um, [PAUSE] they started, or they're going to start because a couple of nurses got, you know, they -- they have a lot of, um, morphine and stuff --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, um --
R:  Yes.  So, that -- that I w- would think would be an avenue for an addict to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get access for one.  And again it's in a -- it's a safety issue.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we had -- 
R:  If someone's --
L:  -- you know, we've had patients who have stolen drugs, you know.
R:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Um, I have one -- we had one nurse, she w- -- she was always ending up with these weird patients but, um --
R:  Oh, no!
L:  -- you know, 'cause y- y- you bring the -- well actually it's the patients' families are stealing 'cause you bring them, um, drugs that on the open market, uh, we just saw on the news that oxycontin on the open market's six thousand dollars.
R:  [LIPSMACK] My -- wow!
L:  Yeah.  From -- it's, like, I forget what they said; sixty dollars a pill or something.
R:  Yeah.  I, um, [LIPSMACK] there was a Times article about how that's become the rural drug.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, people will crush it and it kills the time rel- -- that gets rid of the time release, um, coding.
L:  Right.
R:  And they get, you know, it's as bad as heroin now.
L:  Yeah.  It is.  And it -- it's, you know, they give it to the patients but, you know, you've got family in there and [inaudible] where there are teenagers sometimes.  And they can't keep it locked up all the time I don't think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they count the pills.  I know they give 'em a certain amount of pills.  But, um, [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I thought it was kinda strange w- when she a kept getting called out to people's houses [LAUGH] just to --
R:  [LAUGH] t- -- 
L:  -- you know, count the pills.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  You know -- 
R:  I would -- yeah.  Oh, it's outpatients down there?
L:  Uh, ho- -- yeah, well this -- this hospice is so small they don't have a house yet.  And, um --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- yeah, they're trying I think.  But, um, they have -- they have a lousy administration.  Um --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- I've got an application for the one in Marion County, but the one over here has, um, the administrator and the director of nurses, they've had, like, issues.  I worked there a year and a half and while I was there, probably had thirty people quit, you know.  They just --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- really, they're not [LIPSMACK] the greatest.  In fact one of the nurses went down to Marion County to hospice and she says what a big difference.  But, uh, these two just came in when I started and, um, they're really bad --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- as far as, you know, [LIPSMACK] th- --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- they're bad administrators.  
R:  Hm.
L:  I used to work, um, [LIPSMACK] I was an administrator over in, um, [LIPSMACK] at Gorman[?] Aerospace for quite a few years and, you know, I never --
R:  I didn't realize that was in Florida.
L:  -- mm, I don't know, Flor- -- Florida's [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] I don't know [SIGH] it's strange down here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm down here twenty two years.
R:  My dad tells me -- actually he's on the Gulf Coast --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he tells me it's -- it's an odd place [LAUGH] but it's comfortable for him.
L:  Well, we was, um, we was in Citrus County, which is, um, sorta central.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  Whi- -- and, um, like, we're about eighty five miles, uh, I guess north of Tampa.
R:  Mm, okay.
L:   Right, but it's kinda, like, um, I don't know [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But what I'm down here twenty two years ago I moved in -- into the Tampa area -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it was like going back in time.  They were like --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- fifteen years behind the times.  You got down here and -- and you said something to 'em, I mean, they never heard of a word processor, you know.
R:  You're kidding.
L:  They were still using carbon paper and -- and dictaphone machines.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  And, um, I came down I used to be a system personnel director up in Marion, uh, up in Clifton, New Jersey.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Mm.
L:  And I was making, like, six hundred dollars a week, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I came down here and the same job paid a hundred and thirty five and they want a masters' degree.  You know --
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  -- I mean, they're -- this was twenty two years ago.
R:  Still ...
L:  But right now, if you make in this county, six to eight dollars an hour, you're making good money.
R:  Pshaw.
L:  They're so far behind the times.  But they have what's called the, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know for the -- I don't know w- -- uh, it's something the hundreds.  And it's a hundred men -- businessmen that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- got together and formed a group.  And to keep the place so that the, um, what happens is the owners and the businessmen, they keep their profit in their pocket --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they don't let anybody else get ahead.  And if somebody does move up -- say you moved in from New Jersey with a business and st- -- and you ju- -- started paying well.
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, they can fix it and they boycott you.  I mean, they're really bad down -- 
R:  Like, you -- you're -- you're bus- -- you actually pay your employees higher than the local rate?  
L:  Yes.  You pay them, like, our broker, right --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- pays -- pays our, um, office coordinator.  Well, she -- she's not the greatest one but she -- she's good, she helps you and everything.  She's just not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a real good coordinator.  But he pays her seven dollars an hour.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She asked for a raise so that they gave it -- they gave her fifteen dollar -- fifteen cents raise --
R:  Ooh.
L:  They're fighting over it.  They won't give her a fifteen cent raise.  And she doesn't get any benefits or anything.  And she goes home sick, she's sick.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she doesn't get paid.  And we were talking and I said, "You know, in California it's nine fifty", where --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, my cousins and I used to be out there a lot.  And I said, "And, you know, the cost of living there" -- well, the cost of living there is so high.  I said the housing is higher but, you know, the food and the clothing's the same price.  Or if not cheaper over there.  So, where, you know, where are you coming --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with, you know, paying a girl seven dollars an hour?
R:  Pshaw.
L:  You know, but they --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- haven't, uh, he says, "I think everybody should be making six dollars an hour".  Well, he does- -- you know, he's got a rich father --
