L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Carol.
R:  Hi, I'm Nancy.
L:  Well, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.
L:  Um, this is actually my second time doing this.  Have you done this before?
R:  Yes, this is my second time also.
L:  Okay, okay.  So, um, I guess we just kind of jump into it and start talking about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, where -- I'm just -- I'm in New York, where are you calling from?
R:  Oh, I'm in New York too.
L:  Oh, okay, Manhattan area?
R:  No, actually closer to Albany.
L:  Oh, how nice. It's up state, it's -- it's nice [LAUGH] and pretty up there.  That's great.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, so this is censorship on -- I think, if I understood correctly, it was --
R:  Right.  If the public and private schools have a right to tell students to read certain books.
L:  Um, I guess I have mixed opinions on that. I- --
R:  I have sort of a unique perspective because I'm a home schooler.
L:  Mhm, okay, so go ahead.
R:  And I'm one -- I -- so I don't think that they really should tell students they have to read a certain book because there are some books I wouldn't want my kids to read, and if they said they had to read a certain book, I would probably -- if my kids had gone to school, I probably wouldn't have let them.
L:  I see, like what kind of books?
R:  Well, I guess the first thing that comes to my mind, is like, Ayn Rand.  I had to read one of her books in high school.  It was really not so bad but, um, some of the other books of hers I've read --
L:  What types, I mean, what genre?
R:  Well, it's this --
L:  Because I'm not familiar with that author so --
R:  Oh.  I'm trying to think of what she really writes.  I guess it's sort of like a political thing, you know.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I wish I could remember.  It's been a long time since I read her books.  But certain -- and then there's also certain other books that probably schools wouldn't have them read but I would be real upset if my -- they told my kids they had to read something like, um, a Stephen King book.
L:  [LAUGH] I see, because, you know, I -- I do have mixed feelings on that, you know.  One, um, I don't think -- well, this is about censorship.  You know, I believe that everyone has kind of a choice of what they want to read.  Um, but if they're teaching certain things about -- I remember a few years back or maybe several years back, they were talking about removing the whole Hitler section from all the history books, um, and to pretend, like, the -- the whole event in Germany never happened.  And I know there was a thing going on in court in the west coast because at the time I was on the west coast, and, you know, they ruled against it saying that maybe, you know, just because the history doesn't repeat itself, we should still leave it in there.  Um, [MN]
R:  Well, actually, um, it's unfortunate but actually the text books in public schools are censored already.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- and I was reading not too long ago about, um, a lot of things that have to do with American Indians that, um, they want to change and stuff and -- and really you can't change history the way it happened, it happened the way it did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you can say -- you can change it to make it look all nice and pretty, but it's not really --
L:  Right, but it's not --
R:  It's not education.
L:  I mean, that -- right, well, that's the thing that they were doing about several years ago was, you know, I went to school in the are- -- Indian reservation.  I have friends who are on the Indian reservation, you know, so I have read both sides, and it's very different, um, and I'm also Japanese, so I grew up reading Japanese history and then I also learned, you know, American history here and what happened in Japan and, you know, you have two very heroic views that are completely different in terms of the way they're told.
R:  Right.  Well, like -- like in World War Two, when we -- when we put Japanese in internment camps, that was very wrong and it was very sad that we did that but we can't just say we -- well, we didn't do that when we did.
L:  Right, right.  I -- I do agree with you completely there.  I was just bringing up a topic of like several years ago there was a big deal in court that they were going to take out the slaves, the slave trade, and also the Hitler from all the, um, text books, so that way the new -- I guess the new generation that would be learning, um, you know, whether it was history or what not, would I guess be censored from that.  I wasn't too much into it, I wasn't -- I wasn't like an active professor at the time, um, but this is when I was doing my thesis at the time.
R:  Yes.  Well --
L:  So --
R:  I see both -- I see like two extremes because there's that extreme and then there's the other extreme where Christians tried to -- I am a Christian so it's not like I am bad mouthing [LAUGH] something I don't know anything about.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- but I see Christians in the absolute opposite where they try to make all the Founding Fathers out to be Christians.  Well, they weren't.  A lot of 'em were Unitarians and -- and, but they tried -- but they tried to do like the opposite where they tried to sanitize everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And even the puritans and the -- were very, um, prejudiced against people like the Quakers.  They wouldn't even let the Quakers come to their -- their colony so you can't -- so there's the other side too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Where you can make things look too good or too bad or --
L:  Right.
R:  Or, um.
L:  I think there should be a balance, but the hardest thing to define the balance is you don't know.  You know, everyone has their own definition of what should be taught and what should not be, and it's finding that balance I think, um.
R:  Right.  Well, I think that's part of the reason why the -- there's such a big rise in home schooling because, um, parents want their -- don't want their children taught from a certain viewpoint, and it's not just from a conservative viewpoint either.  There's a lot -- a lot of people home school from a liberal viewpoint where they don't want their children taught the conservative stuff too. [SIGH] I don't -- I mean, I have known people -- that's not my viewpoint, but I do know people from that viewpoint.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I -- I just think that if -- I think that part of the problem though is because parents don't have -- that's -- for probably twenty years, parents didn't take a very active role in the school, what was going on in the school, and then all of a sudden they like, woke up and saw that schools were bad.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And if they had really been paying attention all along, they could have kept things, um, from getting to that point.
L:  Right.
R:  There's a lot of things that living in New York is interesting because, well, the stuff of the budget and everything, and -- and it's like if we pour more money into the schools, it will make it okay.  And it doesn't make it okay at all.
L:  But then there's the whole Bush thing where he's trying to, you know, cut -- cut on education and --
R:  [COUGH] Well, the point is I'm trying to make is if you use your money wisely --
L:  Right.
R:  Which they don't, and our -- our public -- we've got a really small town and our public school system has to pay [SIGH], I think like five thousand dollars a day of fines because they haven't -- they haven't done certain things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like fix certain things in the school and -- and instead of -- instead of paying the fines, why don't just fix it?  But [SIGH] I don't know.  It's things like that that just, ah, that's why we have to pay so much money for our taxes for education because the schools is just not doing what they should have been doing in the first place.
L:  Yeah, I'm still -- I'm still, I've only been here for a little over a year, so I'm still getting used to New York and it's a big adjustment from California.
R:  Oh, I'm sure it is.  [LAUGH] I lived in Arizona before I lived here.
L:  Also in like -- in terms of school systems and, um, just education, it's -- I haven't gone to school here because I had, you know, I had graduated, um, with my Masters before I headed out this way, but [MN] it is very different for me.  Um, just the city itself I think is very different, and so I'm -- I'm just assuming that in the schools, what they teach, um, I'm not sure how that works, I've heard that Manhattan has some really bad -- I guess education systems.
R:  I don't really know much about New York City at all.
L:  But I -- because all the money basically goes into like the subway systems and shopping, you know, just maintaining, um, the tourist attractions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that's -- that's what I heard.  Um, but, you know, all the Ivy League schools are out here, so.
R:  Well, I know in different parts of the country 'cause I lived in Tucson Arizona for a while --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- I came from north west Pennsylvania, so even going from there to Tucson was just totally different, and you know what I mean, the culture, you'd think it was all United States but it's so different.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's very different, it is very different.  You know, California, I think is different from Utah and I think, you know, like Colorado is also different from New York.  It's every state I think is very, very different.  And just because we speak the same language, doesn't mean that our kids are learning the same thing.
R:  Right.  I mean, just to see how people interact, I mean, I came from a relatively small town, and if you saw somebody you knew, it was like, "Hi, how are you doing?"  And I went to Tucson and people there are just [LAUGH] so different.  I mean, you could -- could, um, walk on the street and somebody you know and they're going to -- this is -- I -- I don't know, it's just -- and I think that education is like that too, and so when we have people that move from one area of the country to another all the time, it's -- I think it can cause problems with education 'cause the education system can't keep up with all this stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Are you okay?
R:  Yeah, I'm just getting over a cold.
L:  I was -- I was, you know, it's funny 'cause I wasn't expecting this call like on Memorial Day [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's -- last time they called about this same time, so like we screen our phone calls so as soon as I
