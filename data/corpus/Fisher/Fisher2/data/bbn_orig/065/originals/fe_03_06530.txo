R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi, I'm Jeannie.
R:  And I'm Lorraine.  How are you?
L:  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  Let's see.  Drug testing; um, my opinion is that I do think it's a invasion of privacy.  Um, I've never had to take one thank goodness, um, but, you know, if it means getting a job -- well actually I had to -- had to take one before this -- I have [several inaudible words] I took a part time job at Walmart one time and had to take one.  So, yeah, I have had to do that.  So, but, um, but I don't, you know, I -- [MN] I don't think that should be a basis on, um, employment.  But then again I can see where the -- where the company wouldn't want anyone, you know, that could be suspected of -- of illegal activities with drugs, uh --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think -- 
L:  -- working for 'em so --
R:  -- sometimes the behavior can be a problem if they're on drugs.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the dependability --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, them showing up for work and the quality of work that they would do.  It is sort of an invasion of privacy but at the same time being in a supervisor position, I realize --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the importance of, uh, the quality of work.  And when they're on drugs or alcohol; either one, you know, they're not at their best and they're, you know, if it's -- depending on the type of work,; if it's machine operating, then --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- it could --
L:  Then -- I can s- -- understand something like that 'cause if it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if it -- it any way would endanger themselves or another employee or a customer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I could see where, you know, that would be [MN] something they would need to test for just to be on a more safer level.  But if it's strictly like, something, like, for an office job where you're not dealing with, [NOISE] you know, anything that -- that would harm -- would harm anyone else or -- but it still, you know, they shouldn't, you know --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- um -- 
R:  Well, I --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- I know that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- in the business I was in a lot of times that people used drugs that also led to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- theft.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, and in different ways.  So --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, you know, I can see the benefits, uh, the character of finding out a person's character --
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  -- uh, because of theft and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know things like that.  But there are jobs that I guess it wouldn't matter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but --
L:  See, you know, I -- I -- I've -- I -- I just -- it -- to me, you know, and I'm sure there's people out there that -- that -- that go out to work, you know, stoned or whatever and -- and those people, I mean, I don't -- I would not understand how they would be able to function.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if -- if you're smart enough, you know, even if you do have a problem like that, that I would think you would realize how I can't do it for the work because then I wouldn't be able to function right and -- and -- 
R:  But, you know, they don't realize they're incapable because I had to have a manager drug tested, uh, and we had been having a lot of theft in that particular --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- store.  And, you know, they're smart because when they need cash, they do refunds and --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- uh, things like that to be able to get cash and saying it was a refund --
L:  Yeah.  Or that, yeah --
R:  -- or a return.
L:  -- then -- then I can -- can kinda understand why, like, even i- -- like, in retail, like, when I went to work for Walmart th- --  because, you know, if -- if you've gotta ha- -- a drug -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- habit like that, I guess that you would, you know, take a chance of stealing money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from a cash register to --
R:  And they put down fake names and --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- [COUGH] fake, uh, you know, addresses and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- stuff.  Being -- being in a -- 
L:  Just to support their habit. 
R:  -- position I did and working, you know, uh, I relate I guess and understand it better, you know.  It doesn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and when you don't do drugs yourself it, you know, you say well gosh, you know, how could they even think of doing it when they're at work but --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah --
R:  -- unfortunately --
L:  -- you would not even -- but I'm -- I guess people do.  I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, you know --
R:  Yeah, unfortunately they do.  Unfortunately I've encountered, you know, a lot of bad situations dealing with drug, uh, you know, from employees.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, I -- I certainly believe in it even though it does feel like an invasion of privacy.
L:  Yeah, it does.  I [MN] I think it does.  But then again, if you don't have anything to worry about, you know, then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's, I mean, you shouldn't, you know, say no, I'm not going to do that because you're invading my privacy.  To me that sounds like you're guilty anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, by if you refuse to take it it sounds like you're guilty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and -- and like, and -- and it's like if you haven't anything to worry about, you shouldn't have any problems with it.  But, you know, I -- I d- -- I don't -- I don't really -- really know.  I mean, to me I just don't see, I mean, I've seen people how they -- they've acted on it and, you know, like, marijuana or something, I'm, like, well how can you even function on your day to day [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- activities, you know, it's like, oh and then -- it could be anything, okay these people are out driving cars and they're out, you know, you know, [MN] I just, uh, to me it's scary enough as it is, you know, the [inaudible]--
R:  Yeah.  You know, unfortunately I -- I've had, uh, you know, too much experience with people on drugs and as a matter of fact, uh, my step brother lived with me and I didn't even know he did drugs.  And he was killed --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- over drugs.  So --
L:  Oh, my Gosh --  
R:  -- you know, it --
L:  -- how awful!  Oh.
R: -- it's a kind of a more I guess I've been involved in and my ex husband was a policeman so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it kinda I guess I relate to it --
L:  You -- it hit you more at home --
R:  -- in a different manner.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah.  It hits you more h- -- at home.  So --
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I've had to --
L:  Yeah.  And -- and you know you think about --
R:  -- to encounter it.  But if I never encountered it, I would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thank gosh, you know, that's not fair.   [LAUGH] 
L:  And you just kinda r- really wish you had those signals there at the time, you know, to kinda help, but -- but then again what those that are on it it's just --
R:  You can't tell.
L:  -- you -- you can't help.  You can't e- -- and you can't really help either unless they want to be helped.  And -- and --
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I -- I didn't -- like I say he lived with me and, you know, we worked --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- different hours but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I never realized that he had a drug problem and --
L:  No.
R:  -- till he was shot --
L:  An- --
R:  -- and killed.
L:  Oh, well, you know, and -- and I've seen -- I've heard of people that have and -- and to look at 'em you're like, "Oh, you're kidding, I wouldn't have never have imagined".
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  -- you know, as if -- and -- and just --
R:  -- and it makes you wonder how they can even afford it this day and time.
L:  Oh -- oh, I know, I know.  I go- -- you know, it's enough to make the [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Have extra -- have the extra to do that other stuff.  I -- I just don't understand.  So, I was just [MN] but it --
R:  Yeah.  And you see 'em they can't afford food but they've got drugs --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and alcohol.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, I was watching that -- I have that, uh, lifetime movie I think how -- how Mr. Harper and I kept thinking, okay that lady's going out for -- for drugs but yet her children are starving.  And I'm, like, "Oh, my gosh", you know.  And it's -- the reality is that there's people like that already, I mean, out there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that would spend it inste- -- spend it on that as opposed to spending it, you know, on food for their family or a roof over their head.  It just doesn't make any sense to me at all.  I mean, it's like their priorities are -- are very selfish, you know --
R:  Yeah.  They're -- they're so --
L:  -- they're -- they re only interested in their own wants and not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, providing for what they've created.  Or it's -- it just -- it -- to me it's just it's --
R:  And, you know, it seems like --
L:  -- it's hard.
R:  -- people do it, you know, without even thinking the -- the --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- consequences and, you know, in the workforce there, you know, there's a tremendous amount of -- of danger and theft and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, embezzlement and it all has --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- to do with needing the money to get a fix.  So --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely, definitely, you know -- 
R:  -- you know, I can see a company's standpoint, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Especially if they -- if they do, you know, require that you handle money, uh, I -- I know that when I worked for Walmart, you know, they had me think, sign an anti theft thing, you know.  You know, 'cause if they were going to put me on the cashier line they just, like, well, you know, you've gotta make sure we can trust you, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, 'specially [several inaudible words] --
R:  And then you wonder well I wouldn't have taken the job if I wasn't --
L:  -- yeah. 
R:  -- trustworthy.
L:  Exactly.  I wouldn't taken, uh, taken your -- your drug test either if I couldn't be trusted with that either.  I was, like -- like, you know, uh, [several inaudible words] but you never know, I mean, people in, you know, all walks of life, all areas, you know, people that don't think, wouldn't think twice about; oh something like that never them.  They are, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, it -- they just look like all different ki- -- I mean, they say it's everywhere apparently so I understand.  I just --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and it's scary that it -- that it's in our schools.  That's what worries me. 
R:  Right.  
L:  You know, 'cause I -- 
R:  My -- my sister is a teacher and my sister in law is a principal and, you know, I mean, even in, uh, elementary it's a major problem.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.
R:  And you wonder how they get the money.
L:  Oh, well, [MN] you know, that kinda makes me wonder if they're getting it from their parents.
R:  Yeah.  Or either stealing from parents.
L:  You know, if they're either -- i- if -- exactly.  If they're getting the money from the parents or they're getting the drugs from their parents.  I'm, like, "Oh, my gosh".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I just don't -- I -- and it's just, you know, I have a daughter, uh, who's in elementary and -- and a son who's going to be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in elementary a couple of years and it just makes me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- makes me think of private school.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know, it's like, we're not rich, I don't think we could do that.  But it is just -- oh, I don't -- I don't know, where I mean, but I -- we've --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- had these talks, you know, well just say no.  That's -- that's the big point and my daughter's real good about that.  So, she's -- she knows, you know, that she doesn't need something like that.  It's not going to do her any good.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, but, you know, peer pressure is what I worry about the most, you know, so ...
R:  Yeah.  And they're so --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- +impressionable -- impressionable at that age.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So, anyway, but, uh, as far as the workforce goes, you know, I -- I mean, I do think it's an invasion of privacy but may- maybe the -- the employers should maybe [MN] I don't know, maybe hire somebody and then if they suspect maybe -- maybe say, okay, w- we suspect you of something, we would like you to take this drug test.  But the -- 
R:  Yeah, there are -- there are options.  We had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that policy, uh, in the hair business.  We didn't drug test and -- unless they got --
L:  Unless they --
R:  -- hurt on the job --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or continuous, uh, being out or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, things like --
L:  You see signs of it.  I think you could -- you see signs of it.  Like being out a lot like that, or just [MN] a certain, you know, or taking long lunches makes me -- makes you wonder, [NOISE] you know this -- I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't, um, [MN] th- there's, you know, or like theft, you know, like theft, if they -- if they suspect you of overly, you know, your -- if your cash is over -- is short so many times, you know, I mean, I can see them having errors as far as math --
