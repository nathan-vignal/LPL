L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Hi, this is Brenda.
L:  Hi, Helen.
R:  Hi.  A little bit of static here hold a minute.  [LAUGH] Here just grab my purse.  [NOISE] [MN] Sorry 'bout that --
L:  Oh, it's okay.
R:  It [MN] [NOISE] bit staticy outside.  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Okay so we supposed to talk about the topic -- this is the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- first phone call I've done.
R:  This is the first one I've done too.
L:  Ah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Drug -- drug, um, [LIPSMACK] what is it?  Drug, uh --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- testing for employees --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- companies.  Um, well --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, I think it's a good idea sometimes.
R:  In some cases, yeah.  
L:  In some cases.  Um, f- -- you know people who take care of others or, uh, c- community services people.  I don't know what we're supposed to talk about.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  How do we feel -- how do we feel about all this?
R:  I'm guessing.
L:  Okay.  Um, [NOISE] yeah, is it an invasion to our privacy?  Let me see.-
R:  And sometimes it is. 
L:  You know, right.  I mean, if you're a heavy drug user then you don't want that person taking care of your elderly let's say.
R:  No.  Definitely not.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, [PAUSE] ten minutes going to be long, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They could have gave us a different topic.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Ah -- 
L:  Um -- um -- 
R:  Me, I don't use those type of drugs so it don't bother me --
L:  No.
R:  -- they could test me.
L:  No, right.  I mean, I don't, you know, I'm not a drug user either.  Um --
R:  Course I was [inaudible] 
L:  -- you know, if you're gonna b- -- if you're going to be driving a c- -- a -- a -- a bus -- 
R:  Oh, most definitely.
L:  -- for the -- for the state where you know, like, the -- the city or whatever just city barker[?], and like I said you going to be driving a bus or a taxi them hey, you don't want sh- -- [PAUSE] and, uh --
R:  Yeah, most definitely you have to have them, uh, drug tested.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I believe so.  I don't know who gets drug tested.  I don't know, um, that the companies that do drug testing, I don't, you know --
R:  Well, a lot of 'em aren't doing it any more. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] Just, like, when I just started my job; I work for a telecommunication company --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- [inaudible] before we could even, uh, start, we had to have a drug test. 
L:  See that [MN] -- and this is tele- -- what -- what would you say telecommunications?
R:  Yes.  For telemarketing -- well w- -- not telemarketing; I'm the customer services department.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm sure they had to do it in their part too so [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm, mhm.  And see that, yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, they want to protect themselves I'm assuming.
R:  Probably.  [NOISE] But also it's sort of like a violation of everybody's rights.
L:  I know.  [PAUSE] Right.  But they usually, um, they usually tell you this at the inch- int- interview.
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm assuming, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  I know I've never, you know, most -- I'm a homemaker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I worked for a time but, um, but never a big company -- never a company on my own -- self employed.  So, I never went through any of this.
R:  Well, see, uh, this is the first time I've ever had to go through it.  [COUGH] But it didn't bother me 'cause I know I was drug free.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I never touched the stuff so --
L:  Right.  [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] Okay, [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And where are you from?  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm -- I'm from Ohio.
L:  Ohio, yeah.  I'm -- well now in New York.
R:  Oh.  [MN] [NOISE] Not too far away.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not too far.  [inaudible] not too far.  Um, a lot of New York I k- -- I know, um, like I said, the city bus companies and stuff -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I know they probably drug test.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- probably the Long Island Railroad also.  
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  But that -- this is just a -- a -- this is just, um, a surprise testing too.  They do it, um, whenever they feel like it.
R:  Um, I have no idea.  I know they used to do it when you first start.  Other --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- than that I don't know.
L:  Mhm.  Like a surprise attacks.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Far as I know they don't do that.
L:  Mm.  
R:  But there are --
L:  That -- 
R:  -- companies that do do it.
L:  Right.
R:  If they suspect -- 
L:  And -- and they're allowed to do that?
R:  Uh, yeah.  If they suspected that you're using on the job, they can do that.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But they have to -- they sh- -- have to show a just cause though before they can do it.
L:  Exactly.  I would think so, right.
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.  [PAUSE] Um -- [NOISE] um, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I'm trying to think too --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't -- so I'm not exactly sure what they want you to say.
L:  [LAUGH] Sometimes I wonder why I sign up for these things.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And usually I'm not in the lack of, uh, a lack of -- of not a, you know, lack of conversation here, you know, I'm usually just chatter, chatter, chatter.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH] But when there's a topic -- 
R:  Oh, it just gives you something to do. 
L:  -- I have to [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Also -- actually they're putting you, like, on a spot and you've got to think of something that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I guess, you know, when you're in the medical field too [PAUSE] that you -- you know, let's -- let's say a surgeon -- I -- I don't know if they test.  If they're -- 
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Uh, you know, it's -- 
R:  That would be one --
L:  -- I wish they gave us --
R:  -- thing that I would [MN] --
L:  -- I wish they gave us some information who gets tested.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] That's for sure.
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  'Cause I'd definitely want a surgeon tested.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I would think.  Yes, I would think.
R:  Mm. 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Maybe that's what's wrong with this country.
L:  Mm.
R:  Going to the hospital, you gotta worry whether you're going to come out alive or not.
L:  You're not kidding.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You're not kidding.  [MN] Managed care --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well that's not the topic but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- hey, I could -- I could talk a lot about that one.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] but, um, uh, I don't know, I'm a -- I'm a mother with teenagers also.  I don't, you know, I -- I wouldn't want my children to be using drugs and -- and stuff and [MN] as a -- as a mother, and if they have, um, uh, let's say a part time job or whatever, I would feel that's pretty good actually [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they get tested.  'Cause I wouldn't, you know, some signs aren't, you know, [MN] doesn't show signs of using drugs.  Um, keep them on the right track.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, [PAUSE] but as a community service worker, I would definitely feel that it's important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH] to be tr- -- to be tested, even though it is kinda a vi- violation but [PAUSE] and, uh, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as a -- as a child care provider maybe, nursery school -- I don't, uh, nursery school -- I don't know who gets tested like I said.
R:  And I don't know either.
L:  Mm.  
R:  Actually I thi- -- actually I feel it should be just cause before they can actually test you.
L:  Right.  Some kinda evidence, some kinda whatever.
R:  They shouldn't be able to just go in and take it.  [NOISE] 
L:  Right, right.
R:  [NOISE] Course that don't bother me t- to take one but --
L:  I know.  Like you said.  Me either actually.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] [COUGH] 
L:  Um, [PAUSE] [NOISE] in this type of world all these s- silly drugs that are available now, [PAUSE] um, wouldn't want anybody using drugs.
R:  No.
L:  [COUGH] And what's to say it's a prescription drug --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for some kind of medical reason.  Wh- whatever that, you know, that test may be --
R:  Well, they don't test for that because I went through that.
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I take blood pressure pills and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and anti depressants and they -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they don't test for that.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  They test, like, heroin, marijuana, cocaine and stuff like that.
L:  All righty then.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Some heavy duty stuff out there.
R:  I know when I went in the hospital, they tested me for everything because they didn't know what was wrong with me.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They tested me for heroin, cocaine and all that stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So, I went in I had two strokes and a cardiac arrest.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  [NOISE] And they di- -- they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.  [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I pretty much had to self diagnose myself when I got out.  I told them what I took and they said, "Okay".
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Started taking one of those Alka Seltzer cold and sinus medications --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the effervescent --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that you put in the water.
L:  Right.
R:  That's the first time I ever took anything like that.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And you had a bad re- --
R:  And I'm sorry I did.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and you had a bad reaction?
R:  Yes.
L:  Very bad?
R:  Yes.  Nearly killed me.  [NOISE] 
L:  See that.  [NOISE] 
R:  I've still got a puffer for high blood pressure now.  And now I got to take anti depressants, water --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- pills.  
L:  Mhm, mhm.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  But who's to say that's -- with the urine like, I said, that's how they take it with the urine, right?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That -- 
R:  Most of the time.
L:  -- that any of that --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- stuff would come up though.  Like some kind of, um -- [LIPSMACK] um, irregular urine test analysis whatever maybe 'cause you took an over -- over the counter something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Who's to say that, you know, um, they don't see that -- that is a violation though.  You know, I mean, they see something but they don't know for sure exactly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what it is.  So now you got to fight li- -- you know, let's say if you take a co- cough medicine; a lot of that has, like, alcohol in it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you gotta fight why -- argue the system why you, um, show the alcohol.  And because I took a cold, you know, a cough medicine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know how they would fight that.  Or would they believe the person?
R:  Well, I don't think they actually test for alcohol.
L:  No?  
R:  I don't think so.  I think it's just, like, marijuana and stuff like that.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Well, it's, uh, readily available sometimes too, you know.
R:  Yeah.  'Course they've got that new test where they take the hair follicle and they could --
L:  Oh, right, right, right.
R:  -- test you back for many years.
L:  -- the DNA type of think, yeah.  Mhm --
