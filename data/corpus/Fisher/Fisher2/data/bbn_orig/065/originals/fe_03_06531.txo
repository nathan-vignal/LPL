R:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Twyla.
L:  Hi, my name is Eleanor.
R:  How are you, Eleanor?
L:  I'm fine.  And you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  That's good.
R:  [NOISE] How do you feel about this topic?
L:  You know what, um, I guess everybody drug tests now, you know, like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- as a condition of employment but [SIGH] I don't know, spot checking people; I guess that is kind of invading privacy a little bit.
R:  Well, uh, I -- I'll tell you.  I can understand some employers, um, you got truck drivers with CDL[?] licenses --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and they take black beauties and all kinds of uppers and stuff to stay awake.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I'm a nurse --
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah.  And I'll tell ya, I work for a company that drug tested before, um, you were hired.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And about eight months later they still hadn't drug tested anybody else after the [several inaudible words] I went -- counted drugs with a nurse.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when I was [PAUSE] arranging my card after she had left I found her stash of drugs where she had been signing them out to give the patients and hadn't been giving them to them.
L:  Oh oh.
R:  Uh-huh.  I don't have a problem with companies drug testing employees.  Spot checking with that.  I have a problem with schools randomly drug testing children.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  The kids.
R:  Ah, yeah.  The ones in sports and --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- thing well, you know, these are our rules, you know, they wanna play in sports, they can -- we can do that.  I don't think that's right.
L:  You know what, sometimes I think some places should do it and some places shouldn't.  Like, [PAUSE] I don't know, like, if -- if somebody being on drugs would present an unsafe situation [PAUSE] you know, like, I work where there a lot of welders and machinists, you know, and they have a lot of accidents.  A ton of 'em seems like to me.  I don't know --
R:  But --
L:  -- you know what, there's bound to be somebody that's gonna complain though, you know, what I mean?  That's going to make a big fuss out of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If they try and do that.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I can give you another example.  We had a -- a family pregnant lady, six children -- [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hit by an attorney who worked for a well know firm who was talking on his cell phone.  And when they tested him -- this is a very wealthy man -- he was high on cocaine.
L:  Mm, mm, mm.
R:  And he wiped out an entire family because he was high on cocaine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and talking on his cell phone while he was driving.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] so you have six children, mom, dad an unborn child --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  -- dead.  You know.  Like I said, I don't have a problem with random drug testing.  I don't have a problem with it at all, um --
L:  You know what --
R:  -- and I look at it this way --  
L:  -- it's too bad there are so many drugs.
R:  -- if I had --
L:  And there is so many people using.
R:  -- i- if you go to a work for an agency that they tell you from -- from day one, we do random drug tests --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then you got nothing to complain about if they randomly pick you to go drop a UA.  I mean, it's not unreasonable because you agreed to that --
L:  'Specially if you were told up front.
R:  -- Mhm.
L:  Okay, I agree with that.  Definitely.
R:  I don't believe they can just come in and say, "Okay, this is our new policy and you go drop a UA".  No.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That is a violation of your rights because that was not their policy when you were hired.  [PAUSE] And I don't feel they have a right to just walk in and say, "You're going to do it now".  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, but you're right, if they were warned, you know, if you know that's the company policy --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- then if you work there you should expect that.  
R:  [NOISE] I mean, too many people are getting away with it.  Uh, [PAUSE] they're doing drugs that aren't just hurting themselves, they're hurting other people.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  'Specially doing drugs and driving.  That -- oh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, it's --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- it's dangerous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- they're killing innocent people.
L:  You know what, I don't want to die in a car.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] neither do I.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I don't want to die in a car and I don't want to die in a fire.  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it's like --
R:  And I -- it's -- it's -- it's ludicrous, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, I -- the only drugs I do are the ones the doctors give me or the over the counter ones that I need for my asthma.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And my aspirin a day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, that's it.  I very seldom even have an alcoholic drink.
L:  I hear you.
R:  Because it affects my -- my frame of mind, it affects my thoughts --
L:  Mm.  I'm a -- not a drinker either.  I don't drink either.  I take, uh, blood pressure medicine, you know, and that and drinking does not mix.
R:  [NOISE] That's not Pepsi and you better leave it alone.  It's mine.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] But, uh, [NOISE] [PAUSE] I don't feel that the government has the right to tell us, uh, you're going to do this.  Or we're going to take this away from you, or we're going to take that away from you.  You know, because then we're no longer living in a democracy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a violation of our rights.
L:  I don't know, things are so spooky now.  You know what I mean?
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Ooh, the spooky world we live in.
R:  Get a little drink and stop.  [NOISE] Yeah, but, uh, oh it is, it's -- it's a terrible world [NOISE] we live in.
L:  Yeah, It is.  [several inaudible words] I -- don't know.  They're on --
R:  Where are you located?
L:  -- self destruct -- I live in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, I'm in Jersey.
L:  Near Pittsburgh.
R:  I'm in Jersey.
L:  Oh, I hear you.
R:  [NOISE] And it's just -- it's bad here.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's really, really bad.
L:  You know what, I feel bad for my grand kids.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Mine [MN] [PAUSE] well my grand kids I don't worry about.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They're in a small ranchy community of about two thousand people --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- three hundred miles from --
L:  What a blessing.
R:  -- three hundred miles from any major city.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Fifty miles from any -- any big town, you know --
L:  What a blessing.
R:  -- and in the middle of nowhere.  And, uh, [PAUSE] very seldom did you find any drugs there.  And if you did the cops were all over the place.  They didn't hesitate to go look to find out who the dealers were and get 'em out of there.
L:  Know what [SIGH] there's many people that do drugs now, it makes me think that somebody sitting up pretty high is profiting from it.  Because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you would think they could clean up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the mess.  They could get rid of the drugs.
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.  [NOISE] Um, but, uh, [NOISE] [PAUSE] but, uh, i- it's -- it's so hard for me to comprehend [NOISE] [PAUSE] anyone feeling their civil rights are being violated if they're working for someone and that person says, "You need to take a drug test".
L:  Well, you know --
R:  Not only was I a nurse, but I also worked for a company that made precision oxygen valves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for deep sea divers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hospitals, and nursing homes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- these things are life --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and death valves.  You don't want someone high on drugs putting those valves together.
L:  Yeah.  There you go.  That's what I say about those spend nuclear fuel boxes they make on my job.
R:  You know, I mean, well, okay, you're -- you're working in a -- in a high risk area too.  You don't want somebody high on drugs in there with you, have a radiation leak, you know.
L:  Well, we don't, um, we're not around the radiation.  But I work for a company that makes boxes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that, um, power plants store, um, their nuclear -- spent nuclear fuel in, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] so you don't want those leaking.
L:  Heavens, no, you know.  
R:  So, I -- I -- I really have a hard time understanding why anybody would feel their -- their civil rights are being violated.  You know, with random drug tests required random blood drug tests.  I -- I really, you know, it's just hard for me to comprehend that.
L:  I just wish they could get rid of drugs.  Get rid of it.
R:  Well, I don't think that'll --
L:  No. 
R:  -- ever happen.
L:  No.  I guess not.
R:  But people need to start using their brains.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like figure if you're in a job --
L:  There's so many people that don't care.  You know what I mean?  They don't care about their -- they -- you couldn't possibly love yourself if you -- you know, if you do drugs.  You couldn't love yourself.
R:  Oh, no.  No.  No.  And I --
L:  You know, and if a --
R: -- I'm the same way with -- with my daughter.  She lost -- she had a stillborn baby --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and got no comfort from her husband and turned to drugs.  And now she's facing losing her son.  And I don't feel sorry for her.  She can choose to go into rehab.  She can choose to get off of these things.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] And at this point my grandson is better off with his father.  You know, and that -- that sounds hard for a parent to day, 'cause she lost a job because of it.  She's lost --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two jobs because of her drug problems --
