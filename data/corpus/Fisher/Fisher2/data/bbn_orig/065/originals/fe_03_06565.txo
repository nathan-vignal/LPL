R:  -- pay attention to what I'm saying.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, this is Tina. 
R:  Hi, this is Annette.  Where are you located?
L:  Um, in Iowa.
R:  You're in Iowa?  I'm in Ch- -- I'm in Washington.
L:  In Washington?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- this is interesting [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, the -- this is the second call I've done, so ...
R:  Interesting.  Me too.
L:  Yeah, so, we're talking about family values and how we feel, uh, divorce aff- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not quite sure, how divorce affects the way we feel, or ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I think that -- that's generally the id- -- the idea -- divorce and marriage an- -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, the whole composition of that.  Um, are you married?
L:  Yes, I am -- I -- I --
R:  Uh, so -- okay, so am I.
L:  Yeah, I have four children.
R:  Oh, likewise -- that's interesting.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I have four girls.
R:  Uh, well we've got two and two.
L:  Two and two?  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- I mean, that kind -- that kind of enters into it right there, um, you know, 'cause any ti- -- any time you've got a relationship, it's not -- it's not as surely easy sailing all the time --
L:  That's for sure.
R:  -- but, [MN] but, you know I d- -- and, you know, ours -- ours range from fifteen down to eight --
L:  Ours are, um, twelve and three months.
R:  Oh, what -- did your twelve year old just turn twelve?
L:  Yeah, in February she did.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay, well she's a little bit older than our guy who's turning twelve in Ju- -- twelve next month.
L:  Mhm.  But --
R:  So, it -- but --
L:  -- I think there's a big difference in, like, children wise, of people who are families that are married versus families that are single parents.
R:  It's true -- it's true.  And the difficulty comes in when, um -- [MN] -- I don't know, I've never been -- I've never faced -- faced the -- the prospect of, um, having to live without a partner, having -- after having been married.
L:  Neither have I.
R:  So -- um, it's -- you know, it's -- in that case -- in that case it's a little difficult to talk about, unless, you know, you wind up seeing friends that are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- dealing with, you know, severe situations or something like this -- uh -- [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, but I think just so, like, when the kids have things to do, they're able to come home and either have, like, myself or my husband --
R:  [NOISE] Sure.
L:  -- go and help them.  Whereas a single parent, you know, they'd have had to call the other parent, or the other parent's not involved, and [MN] I just think [NOISE] it makes those children are just totally raised different.  They --
R:  Yes. 
L:  -- have to learn, I think, to be more independent --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- possibly, you know depending on the pa- -- job that their parent works [MN], you know, or sometimes they slip through the cracks, or sometimes you just have a very responsible kid because [MN], you know, that parent makes a -- their goal that they're not gonna have their kids raised to be like their ex.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- it -- it gets -- it gets real difficult too, for the -- for -- for both, because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm thinking of a -- a situation that I was dealing with in a -- a -- a different capacity, it was more like -- more like a mentor here --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- in a pastoral situation.  Um, the young lady was -- she wa- -- she was real responsible, but, uh, the -- the situation was -- was such that the marriage could not be put back together because of -- of safety concerns --
L:  Right, right -- you have that too.
R:  -- and, you know, that is -- it was -- it was really difficult, because the mother was working as hard as she could, and the daughter understood it, but still, um, she had to grow up way too fast, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was -- the mother did a good job in not badmouthing her -- her ex and trying to bring out the good points of what happened, because this was just a -- it was a situation was just plain -- just plain difficult --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [MN] all of a sudd- -- you know, you don't -- you don't necessarily know, and you don't plan for a -- a relationship to disintegrate --
L:  Right, right, you don't.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you walk into it assuming, if you've got your eyes open, assuming that you're going to wind up being on a mutual basis, that's why you got married in the first place --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, that every- --
L:  But, you know, people change --
R:  Oh yeah, and -- [NOISE]
L:  -- and when -- when you have kids in your family, you change; every time you have a new child you change, you know, and I think that's --
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  -- the thing is is you have to learn to accept changes in your partner and you have to learn to change together.
R:  Yes, and if any one of those factors is not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is not the -- is not a mutual situation, then you've got trouble.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And it -- it's not necessarily something you've -- something, again, that's -- that's planned on.  It just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just -- it just tends to happen.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Um, so [MN] ...
L:  Well, then you have, like, relationships, like you said, you know, that for safety reasons or whatever --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- they get out of the relationship because it's not -- not safe for them or their family, and then you have those kids that grow up --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and always wonder how they're gonna feel in a relationship, they sit --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and second guess their relationships, you know, like, [MN] "Is this gonna be a bad, or am I gonna get hurt --"
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Although it --
L:   -- they're afraid to jump into one.
R:  Yeah, and -- but if you may -- if -- if you -- if you wind up providing, you know, providing the, you know -- [MN] you've gotta do some healing yourself, of course --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- but -- or, ah, the person involved in that would have to, but to wind up giving at least a decently healthy view to someone who has --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- sort of, I don't want to say been victimized, but they have been in a sense --
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  -- um, it's -- you know, that's -- that's -- that's tough. 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Um, but it can -- it -- it can be done, um ...  I'm wondering about some of the -- the states where they have -- they've -- they have this -- they have legally enacted this idea of premarital counselling before marriage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm not necessarily for it in all situations, but, you know, I'm [MN] still trying to make up my mind, because with, um, with a background --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with a -- basically, with a background of -- of my folks were married for near- -- for nearly fifty years and literally, death separated them.  I won't say their life was smooth sailing, it wasn't [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.  My parents --
R:  You know --
L:  -- got divorced when I was twenty one.
R:  Ahh. 
L:  You know what, that was --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- a little different, because [MN], in the same respect where, if a child grows up never knowing their parents together --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- they don't know any different --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but yet I had twenty one years of memories of them together, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then had to learn to have them apart. [NOISE]
R:  Well, that must have been kinda tough.  Or did you see -- or was it kinda coming? [NOISE]
L:  Well, you know, at first it was a little -- well, you know, I knew it was gonna happen, but they tried to stay together as long as they could, you know.  But, yet, then when it did happen, it was a little tough, because then it's like [MN] -- to separate your holidays and stuff like that and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I told mom many times, you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know, "Had you just left when we were young and you wanted to --"
R:  [MN]
L:   -- then, you know, we wouldn't of had that, because we would have just grew up -- it would of just all been taken care --
R:  Care --
L:  -- of when we were growing up.  
R:  But I --
L:  We did not -- like I said, we did not know any different.
R:  But I bet the answer -- the answer was -- was more that she wanted -- that they wanted to keep things together -- they wanted to be --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- father and mother to -- to -- well, they wanted to be both together for you -- for the -- for your sake.
L:  Yeah, and they both have admitted that.  It was probably [MN] some of the wrong reasons to stay together, because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they're not always -- didn't always make it easier for us, you know, but --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- but they said, "You know, you always gotta learn from your mistakes".  You know --
R:  Well, is it such -- that's -- that's -- in -- in one sense, even if -- even if it's not -- not necessarily the -- totally the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the least pain -- the painl- -- the most painless thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that maybe actually it's -- it's laudable.
L:  Mhm.  Don't you --
R:  It's -- it's -- it's -- it's admirable to do.
L:  Yeah, don't you think values are a lot different now th- though than they were twenty years ago?
R:  [MN] Yeah, and I see -- I'm -- I strugg- -- I struggle with trying to impart the right values too, because of  [MN] -- everything seems to be more, "My rights, myself, me oriented" first --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I know that's our basic nature, but at the same time, you give up -- when you enter into a -- into a -- into a -- a -- eith- -- you know, either a -- either a deep friendship or a more intimate relationship with somebody that involves living together, especially under the bond of marriage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you wind up giving up some of your -- your rights to yourself --
L:  Me.  Mhm.
R:  -- and your rights to your privacy and your rights to be right all the time and be first.
L:  Right, right.  I agree.
R:  And we still struggle with the nature, you know --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- we're still gonna struggle with it, but there's gotta be that idea of, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you've entered into -- you've entered into a -- into a -- a covenant, that, you know, whether -- whether you see it as a -- as a religious vow or not --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- that you've entered into a covenant to deal with somebody else and when you -- you bring a child into that, you are also reinforcing that for them.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And that, I wonder if it's being -- just is being thought about as, "Oh, let's just play house together, we seem to get along together, we're great friends and we know how to have a good time" --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, yeah I think --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- people are more quick to jump into a relationship and more quick to jump out of it [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more so than [MN], you know, years ago when they used to think about, "Is this really the right -- right choice for me and my family" you know?
R:  Yeah [MN].  Well -- or -- or even farther -- farther back --
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  -- when people got in that -- you know, Fiddler on the Roof time, which is one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of my favorite musicals, it talks about matchmaking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It still gets done, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] maybe -- maybe decades apart or -- or -- or, you know, continents apart as far as their philosophy or their -- their -- their important values, but --
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they're matched together anyway --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they had to live together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  This is way different, so --
L:  Mhm, yeah, it is --
R:  Um --
