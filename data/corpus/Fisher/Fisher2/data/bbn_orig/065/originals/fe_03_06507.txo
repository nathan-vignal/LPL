R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Sharee.
L:  Hi, I'm Tanya, how are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.  [LAUGH] So what did you think of the topic tonight then? [NOISE] 
R:  Um, you know I r- -- I guess I really don't have [NOISE] -- I don't really care one way or another 'cause I don't really watch TV that much --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, it's not like I sit here -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- glued like I'm sitting on some of the trials [NOISE] when people would say they didn't leave their house for [SIGH] [NOISE] days but, [NOISE] you know, I dunno why not.
L:  [SIGH] But we -- you were aware of them though right?  Even --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you didn't really watch them.
R:  [NOISE] I mean, I knew that somebody was on trial, but like I never watched it.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean [MN] --
L:  What'd you think about it, just being so available though?  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I guess if you want to watch it, you've nothing to do then you should --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be able to watch it.  It's better then going and sitting in a court room and watching it but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I can't --
L:  [MN] --
R:  -- see what's interesting.
L:  Do you think it has any, um, impact on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what the result will be?
R:  [SIGH] No, because uh, I mean I don't know, I think if you're a jury you're sequestered usually [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you can't usually get out and hear what the media's saying [NOISE] [SIGH] so I'm not sure that that would have an opinion on it. 
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I don't know if it would or not, I do- -- I mean, [SIGH] I've never been sequestered [NOISE] in a ju- -- in a jury trial, I've always been able to come home.
L:  Oh, have you been jury trial then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, how would you feel if you -- if [MN] -- ah being a juror, that it was put on TV? [MN]
R:  [SIGH] Well, you know, I mean the [MN] -- I -- it wouldn't really matter to me because I was just doing my job and I was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- taking the evidence that they gave me and [NOISE] -- and coming up with what I thought was my decision.  [SIGH] And -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nobody really, [NOISE] you know, influenced me other than the facts but, I don't know, I mean I guess I wouldn't want my face thrown all over.
L:  Right.
R:  Might be a bad hair day or something.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But if you were on TV and you knew it, w- -- you wouldn't have a bad hair day surely --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you'd fix yourself.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd be getting up in four in the morning --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- just to get a good hair day and a new dress.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so the TV has the impact then, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh I just  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I dunno, it's like -- you know I --
L:  So actually --
R:  [MN] --
L:  -- it could -- it could make the jurors and ah, the whole -- the whole criminal justice system a better looking place --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it might make it quicker too if they're paying for the times on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- TV.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] I dunno.  I would hope --
L:  Might help the fashion --
R:  -- that TV --
L:  -- industry.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- wouldn't have a influence on jurors, but [NOISE] --
L:  Mm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] you know I think that sometimes when you -- you're stuck in a jury room, the people in the jury room itself have more of an influence on you, [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with the peer pressure of getting in and then getting out of there.
L:  Mm, have you found that in your jury trials?
R:  Yeah because i- it -- the closer it got to Friday at five oclock --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they wanted us to change our votes and [NOISE] get out of there and get it over with, you know, [NOISE] and the few people that [SIGH] were kinda like either one way or the other, [NOISE] the peer pressure got to be so much they finally I think just caved in and said, you know, [NOISE] "All right, I give up" you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  I -- I never [inaudible] my opinions.  I'm a -- I'm really a strong person when I find -- when somethings we- -- when I've thought about it and I've -- I didn't want to change my opinion, I wasn't gonna change it but, [SIGH] a couple of the people I thought we kinda, maybe swayed a little bit one way or the other, which I guess is what you're supposed to do. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well as I've seen on TV.  I've never been in the jury so, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I can't really offer an opinion on it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Very boring sitting there I'll say.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I can imagine.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] It's like, "Okay" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] "How many more hours of the day I gotta sit and listen to this stuff?"
L:  Actually do they show the jury on TV when they televise these trials?
R:  [SIGH] I think they kept their faces out on most --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because ah -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then they -- I know they kept their names out 'cause they always refer to them as juror number so and so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] which I think is a good thing.
L:  Yeah, me too.  God, that would --
R:  I just --
L:  -- be scary.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know how you could afford to be a juror for any great length of time.
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] I mean, we only get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fifteen dollars a day here.
L:  [NOISE] Where are you, Canada?
R:  In Michigan.
L:  Oh Michigan, yeah, it's not -- I dunno how much it is in New York, but it's -- it certainly doesn't in- [NOISE] -- it's not equivalent to a day's work.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well no, not if you're se- self supporting or on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- commission or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that, [SIGH] I think it'd be really hard to make ends meet but  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah and apparently not having child care isn't an excuse any more --
R:  [SIGH] No, they don't care.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or not having transportation.
L:  They say you can take the kid down to the ah -- you know, they've got somebody that watches the kids in the -- in the like, the court --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- building.  I mean that's, you know, that's --
R:  Oh we don't have that here.
L:  -- really gonna settle your mind that is, isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  But I think it's hard though for people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be on a jury if you're like a mother --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who stays at home all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the time, 'cause you don't -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have child care plans.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, or if you are a sales person on commission it's very --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- could be very costly, [SIGH] but they don't seem to care.
L:  Nah.  Right --
R:  No --
L:  -- you just have to answer all the questions wrong then.
R:  That's right, and you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- could do that real well.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Whereabouts in New York are you from?
L:  Ah, in New York City.
R:  Oh right.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  How many of these have you done?
L:  Phone calls?
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  This is my third one.
R:  Is this your last one?
L:  I hope so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you don't like 'em?
L:  No, it's quite interesting but, you know ah -- I -- I seem to have s- suddenly got busy a lot, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I was like putting myself down for it, like anytime, 'cause it's -- I'd be available at night and -- and then it's -- you know, it pops up and I'm like, "Oh, I just can't take the call now, and I just can't take it now" and so --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- you know, I was all raring --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to go and it suddenly started --
R:  I think three's all --
L:  -- dragging a bit.
R:  -- you can do ca- -- isn't it?
L:  Yeah it is, yeah.
R:  Although the one lady I talked to last time, said she signed up for six more.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I think you -- you can do it from different phones or something.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, different numbers, I dunno.
R:  [SIGH] I don't even remember who this was from, I mean, how I got this co- company anyways.
L:  I got it through the newspaper I think.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, I'm trying to save up for preschool.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You should go --
L:  Sad isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Go on, ah, surveys --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- surveys for cash, have you been on that thing?
L:  I have been on a couple, yeah, but ah, not enough, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I got the childcare problems.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.  [LAUGH] So, I can only go if somebody can look after the kids, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH]
R:  Well, the survey one is on the um, internet.  You just answer them on the internet.
L:  You gotta -- gotta address for that?
R:  Surveys four -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --cash, the four is a number four.
L:  Oh that, yeah, but you don't always get on them, I've had a couple sent through, but you know, I wasn't arthritic or, you know, there was something else that --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I had to be that I wasn't, you know?  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  I signed up for the mystery shoppers and I've been going on quite a few of those.
L:  Wow.
R:  And those are kinda fun.
L:  Yeah, what do you do?
R:  Go to stores and answer questions about the sales people, or you go out to eat and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- answer questions about the service and all that.
L:  Cool.
R:  [SIGH] It's fun.
L:  Yeah, sounds it.  How much they l- -- they pay you?
R:  It depends on um, what you're doing, now the food one [LIPSMACK] they always give m- -- you dinner for two --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and ah, appetizer and drinks --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then um, [NOISE] like the one I'm doing this week, I have to go to a bank and ask um, to open a new account and I have to write down if the tellers thanks me and calls me by my name, [SIGH] and I get paid six bucks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I try to make all of 'em in the same spot, you know --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- I just go from bank, to bank, so 
L:  Gaw, that's pretty good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got fifteen dollars for going to Mrs Fields' Cookies --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] having a cookie.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's a bit of a dream job, isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I can handle that.
L:  Getting paid to eat cookies.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so I mean --
L:  I could send the kids out on that one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] You know [NOISE] some -- I mean, you know, it's fun.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] It, you know -- I don't mind doing this.  It's something extra to earn money.  I [NOISE] have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] a fulltime job, so this is kinda --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like just [NOISE] --
L:  What -- what's your regular job?
R:  [NOISE] I'm a teacher.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, cool.  What -- what grade do you teach?
R:  Fourth grade. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, that's scary.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah it is, just [NOISE] --
L:  Just when they're starting to get attitude, right?
R:  It's -- they're getting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- attitude already, I'll tell you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] It's getting harder and harder now to get rid --
L:  Yeah well, I've got a first grader too and he's already getting the attitude.
R:  Yeah well, wait til they get to fourth grade and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then they really have an attitude.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, you know, only a couple more weeks.
L:  Yeah, how is the school situation where you are?
R:  Um, it's okay.  I mean, I teach in the [NOISE] city so it's terrible, I wouldn't send my kids there but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, where my kids would go is very good, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it just depends on [NOISE] you know, the type of area you live in and --
L:  Is your school failing, or successful or --
R:  Um, not -- they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- failing [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- in the city.
L:  Failing miserably or just, you know --
R:  We're not failing --
L:  -- city failing?
R:  -- miserably.
L:  Yeah?
R:  But the kids don't care.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] They're um --
L:  Do the parents -- are they involved?
R:  Their parents don't care.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  As long as you keep their little baby there all day long --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and don't send 'em home, then they're happy.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  But you know, they don't wanna be involved, they just want to [NOISE] have you take care of everything and 
L:  Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with this country for god's sake, they've got so much cash floating around and the kids are just so stupid here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the parents now --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are so young they just don't care anymore and they --
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- just [SIGH] -- you know it's sad 'cause it --
L:  But it's like there's so much choice here, you know?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  There was never a choice when I was growing.
L:  I know, I mean why [SIGH] people from all over the world want to come here to make something of their lives and the people who were born here just sit on their --
R:  Right.
L:  -- backside and do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fuck all, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause they don't want to do anything.  They don't care about this, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- education is the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- least thing that's important to them, and [SIGH] they're not about to [NOISE] worry about it.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] And that's sad because [NOISE] there -- there is no future for these kids.
L:  No.
R:  I mean, I don't know what they think [MN] we're telling them when we tell them that they [NOISE] can't read, they can't do this, they can't do that, [SIGH] [MN] and there is no future but [SIGH] you can't get that through them.  They just --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- are -- I dunno [NOISE] if they're [NOISE] stupid themselves [NOISE] or not.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] They just can't see, you know?
L:  Yeah, I've had --
