R:  Hello?
L:  Melanie.  Hi.
R:  Hi I'm Janika[?] --
L:  Hi I'm Melanie.  You're Erica?
R:  Janika[?].
L:  Oh, Janika.  Hi Janika.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I live in, um, Los Angeles.
R:  Okay I'm in Atlanta.
L:  Oh, you're in Atlanta?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, nice.  I'm heading out in that direction tomorrow I'm going to Florida.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Kind of humid huh?
R:  Mhm, I'm not sure about there -- here a little bit.
L:  Yeah so I guess the topic is, um, how divorce affected you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Has it?
R:  Well this is an interesting question yeah actually, um, my parents are actually about to file.
L:  Oh, are they really?  How old are you?
R:  Yeah.  I mean I'm twenty one.
L:  Okay.  That's, um, -- I've had you know my parents both divorced when I was five and then I lived with my dad and his second wife until I was about, um, fifteen and I went through a second divorce with him.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  It's definitely I think more dramatic when you're older than, um, --
R:  Yeah like I --
L:  -- when you're younger.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It effected me a lot more, um, when I was older -- I mean when I was younger I was sad and I felt bad that my dad was leaving but then I think I was just more adaptable and able to get used to it.  Where when I was older I felt like such a -- such a shock that they were getting a divorce.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So which is probably how you feel.
R:  Yeah big time like it's been going on, um, threatening or whatever for like maybe seven years now but now it's actually happening like right now.
L:  Do you still live at home?  Or --
R:  No I -- I've been out of the house for about six months almost now but it's still very --
L:  And do you feel like you're torn between the two sides and --
R:  In a way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, um, I don't know like it's -- it's hit -- like I was just talking about this [inaudible] that's funny it just -- just hitting me now more than ever like that I'm not in the house I'm just like, "Oh, my god".  Because I mean at first it was like -- like a couple of years ago when I did live in the house I kind of got over it because I was starting college and I was get a life of my own slowly you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But now that I'm not there it's like when do go ever there like that's what I want -- I want to hang out with my parents you know and it's like they're not -- it's not the same.
L:  Have they -- has one moved out yet?
R:  My -- well that -- that's the other funny thing my dad is moving out like this weekend.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like tomorrow or something or --
L:  And how far is he moving?  Do you know?
R:  He's just moving like across town.
L:  Across town?
R:  Maybe like, mhm, half an hour away -- twenty minutes away.
L:  Okay.
R:  But my mum now is -- is thinking of moving across the country to California because we're from California.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so if she was at -- we were just talking about ten minutes ago actually and she's telling me that she'll probably file for divorce soon.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  It's just -- it's strange to me cause they were together for twenty years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's just -- it's just really strange for me, and I was asking around like cause she's just kind of acting like well we're not going -- she said she's not going to keep in touch with him and I was like that's just odd to me because my dad is always over there like even though he claims that he's moving out or whatever I bet he'll still be over there every day.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah like if they're not like --
L:  It's not like they hate each other.
R:  They don't like they do love each other it's just my dad can't control himself and he decides to cheat on her.
L:  Oh.
R:  But she never really like let go of it or let go of him -- she loves him and she like put so much trust in him that she never like fully let go.
L:  That's awful.
R:  Yeah and -- and he's the kind of person where it's not that he's using her so much it's that like he means well, he's just goes about it way wrong.  Like --
L:  That's too bad.
R:  Yeah, it's a -- they have a strange relationship.  [LAUGH] Like I don't understand it myself but it's definitely affected me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well the good thing for you is that like my parents both my dad and his first wife --
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm thirty one.
R:  Okay.
L:  So both my dad and his first wife which is my mum and both, um, my dad and his second wife hate each other.
R:  Really?
L:  Absolutely hate each other so like the second wife who I actually you know spent a lot of time with especially you know from like nine years old till in my teens you know a very troubled time she was really like the mother figure.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so it was weird just to be totally cut off from her entirely where he couldn't cut me off from my biological mother.
R:  Right.
L:  So but still like they're still battling it out and even now I'm getting married, um, oh, god in October.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So and even now it's like I have to figure out the seatings that --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- they're totally across the room and I really expected that one of them would just say we're not going.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.
R:  Have they?
L:  But right now as of now they're both going so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it makes me as far as like my views on marriage definitely makes me more determined to --
R:  Make it work.
L:  -- have my relationship work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know knowing the effect --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on children even more so.
R:  Right.
L:  Being a product of divorce.
R:  Right.
L:  And even if for some reason you know we were get a divorce just to make sure that we can still communicate and --
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Right cause I'm -- I'm torn between like you know is it -- it's like I don't think it's okay to stay together for the kids you know but like a part -- a little part of me like wishes that they would and I feel so selfish for it but like I don't know I guess I'm just so used to it I don't know another way to feel.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like how do you not want your parents to stay together even though you know it's bad for them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah -- yeah I know what you're mean like you're torn between what's best for you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and what's best for your parents.
R:  Yeah.  And they wouldn't like my parents wouldn't stay together because they're like okay you're an adult now like and they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think they really understand how it effects me like I started going to therapy maybe, um, I guess the start -- last August or October and like -- no it was August and, um, like that's all I talk about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's like maybe eighty five per of what I talk about with my mum --
L:  It's shocking I'm sure.
R:  -- and dad.  Yeah like I didn't realise how much it was always on my mind --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how much it bothered me and how much I really cared about it.
L:  Right.
R:  Being -- like being as old as I am and having like twenty thousand other things going on you know I got school, I've got work, I've got other things to worry about but like that's mainly what I'm worried about.
L:  Yeah it's a huge shock.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely hard to get used to and I know it would be an adjustment for a while I mean imagine when like your mum is dating or your dad is dating and you know there's -- I mean at least you're old enough where you feel you know you can be happy for them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when they're happy versus just you know when you're a kid and you're just kind of you a reaction to everything.
R:  I can understand where they're coming from now doesn't mean I agree with it.  But I understand why.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of what's going on than when I was in high school.  And they tried to keep so much from me but that's what my parents did they tried to keep a lot of it from me.
L:  Yeah.  And you know I can understand that too because they don't want you to have horrible you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they don't want you to take sides they want to try and protect you against the -- against some -- you know the cold reality --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of what's going on but now that you're older you can understand more and reason a little bit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's sad, it's too bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm sure it would be really hard if your mum moved to California -- well unless you like to visit.
R:  Yeah I mean I'd definitely -- it would give me more of a reason to go like I want to go too expensive though.
L:  Do you have, um, brothers and sisters?
R:  I have an older sister but she's fourteen years older than me.
L:  Okay.
R:  So this really doesn't affect her at all.
L:  Right.
R:  Like she's married, has kids like see she lives like seven minutes away but like
