R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello.  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, hi, I'm Rita.
R:  My name is Ellen. 
L:  Dawn, okay.  And how do you feel about drug testing?
R:  Well, um, never had to do it, but, um, I guess if --
L:  Me neither. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I guess if it was a condition of employment, need a job, got to do it [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, I think so [LAUGH].  
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, I -- I -- I know my son ha- -- is a manager of a retail store --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and he does -- he checks, you know, that sort of thing.  And it's part of their -- if they want the job they gotta go for it.
R:  Yeah, I think it's important, you know, for jobs like, you know, pilots and, uh, doctors, and anybody who's, you know, dealing with, you know, safety or treating or people or ... I mean, they should definitely, [LAUGH] you know, not be on drugs.
L:  [MN] And certainly in schools and things like that, too --
R:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.
L:  -- when you're working today.  Um, I know some people feel it's invasion of privacy, but I think those are the people on drugs.
R:  Probably [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Probably.  
L:  Probably.
R:  Yeah, I guess that I've never had to do it, but, um, [LIPSMACK] if I had to do it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I -- I think I would just, you know, do it and ... you know ...
L:  Yeah, I would too, be- because I'm clean.
R:  Right, exactly.  
L:  Yes, I have no problem with that.
R:  Right.  I guess it's people, like you said, you know, the ones who don't wanna do it, if you got something to hide --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [MN] you know, of course they don't want to do it. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  And I think the only thing that happens is you don't get the job --  
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- most of the time.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Unless, I wonder if you're, like, in -- in the position --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and they're doing a random drug test, could you possibly, um, lose your job?  I don't know.
L:  Oh, I'm sure you could.  I'm sure you would.
R:  Yeah, right.  Maybe they would send you to, um, you know, rehab.
L:  That might be --
R:  And, uh, you know, as a condition --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to keep your job.
L:  [MN] Yeah, I'm sure it would depend on -- on the place of employment.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  Yes.  
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's an interesting question though [LAUGH].
L:  It is [LAUGH].  May I ask what state you're from?
R:  I am from Pennsylvania.
L:  Pennsylvania.  And I'm from Minnesota.
R:  Oh, Minnesota.  Cool.
L:  So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, suppose we're supposed to keep talking.
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  Um [LAUGH].
R:  For ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Oh --
R:  This is the second time I've done this, so I'm --
L:  Uh, well, I did it the other day, and nobody talked to me.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I went for the full ten minutes, because I wa- -- didn't want to lose my money --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  -- but no one -- but no one talked to me. 
R:  Yeah ...
L:  So, if they never phoned anybody, or --
R:  Oh.  
L:  -- or what, I don't --
R:  Yeah, both times, um, someone came right on, so --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um.  The other night I did one on hobbies which was -- that was pretty cool.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, you know, tonight's obviously the drug testing [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I wonder what --
L:  But, ah --
R:  -- you know, what the third one will be [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I don't know either.  
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Um, [MN] did you pick this up off -- off an R.M.C.?
R:  [NOISE] Um, a friend of mine, actually.
L:  Oh, a friend of yo- -- okay.
R:  Yeah, um.
L:  'Cause it's on one of the websites, they're advertising.
R:  Yeah.  I believe it's -- I've seen it actually, after my --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- friend told me about it, I've seen it on a couple of different, ah, sites --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but I'd alr- -- already signed up, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's coming out of the University of Pennsylvania, isn't it?
R:  [SIGH] Ah, Fisher, I think.  
L:  [NOISE] Or -- or is that a college, uh, in there?  Or a university?
R:  You know, I -- I'm -- I'm not sure.
L:  Or is that a -- I don't know.
R:  It's -- it's a college, it's a linguistics study.
L:  Oh, okay, that's what we're talking about then.
R:  Yeah, I guess they wanna, um --
L:  But, uh --
R:  -- hear how we're talking, and [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yes [LAUGH].  Um, I don't even know what kind of drugs they test for.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, hmm.  Yeah, me neither, actually.  
L:  [MN] Marijuana, I suppose.
R:  Probably.  Um --
L:  Heroin [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, anything.  I --
L:  Any -- any of the stronger ones.
R:  Right, and, um, I guess, you know, um, urine or blood testing, I guess. 
L:  [MN] I'm sure, most of it is urine, I think.
R:  [NOISE] Right. 
L:  And, uh, I don't know if over the counter drugs would show up on something like that.
R:  I know you have to worry about, um, [LIPSMACK] what is it, the poppy seed bagels.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, there was an episode on Seinfeld, um, years ago.  It was really funny, uh, one of the characters, um, had to, you know, get tested.  And she really loved those poppy seed bagels, and it kept coming up that she was on -- on drugs [LAUGH].
L:  O- o- oh, so they -- [MN] an- and -- and maybe they really, uh, went overboard on it, but ...
R:  I guess so [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, uh, so she kept asking to take the test again, she kept saying, "Oh, it has to be a mistake, it has to be a mistake" [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "You know, I've -- I'm not on drugs".  And then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they figured out that it was her bagel in the morning [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
R:  So, ah, yeah, it's --
L:  Well, I'm sure one bagel wouldn't do it, but, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it made a story.
R:  But it was funny, you know, yeah.
L:  It made a story, yes.
R:  Yeah, to think that that was, you know, what was causing her all that trouble [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- something so simple as, you know, her breakfast [LAUGH].
L:  Ye- -- yes.  Um ...
R:  And to mess up her career like that.  Everybody was thinking she was on -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- on drugs.  
L:  Well, I know my -- my son, y- you know, he doesn't hold to do drug testing, you know, they -- he can't hire a felon, and he can't hire this and he can't hire that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and he said really, sometimes it's a shame because these people have straightened themself out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it goes back, uh, well, since they were eighteen or twenty one, whatever the state law is -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know.  And any time in there, if they were a felon, he can't hire 'em.
R:  Wow, huh.
L:  So, and so -- and if you lie on your application, and you get caught, why that's worse yet, so ... 
R:  Y- yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] Yeah, so --
R:  Yes, it's not worth lying over.
L:  No, no.  But, uh, it really kinda, you know, if you have that kind of a -- a record, it's pretty hard to get a job.
R:  Yeah.  I think.
L:  Especially when -- when high unemployment, you know, then they get pickier.
R:  Mm.  
L:  And so ...
R:  Especially in areas where work, um, isn't easy to find.
L:  Well, that's what I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then they get pretty picky.
R:  Yeah, exactly. 
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Yeah, I'm originally from Massachusetts, um --
L:  Oh, oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've only been in Pennsylvania for, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, about a half a year, 'cause --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- my husband's originally from here.  But, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in Boston, um, work was a lot easier to find.
L:  Oh, I -- I was out there last year --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- uh, last -- last June.
R:  Huh.
L:  Uh, my daughter was there at the time, and we went out to see her.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  
L:  So, we got -- seen everything historical in Boston, I think [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  There's a lot to see, there's a lot to do.  Yeah, I -- I miss it sometimes.
L:  Ye- yes.
R:  But, uh, where we are now, it's a better place to raise -- raise children, so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  But, uh, the job market's tight, uh [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, uh, the pay scale is not what -- what it was either, so --
L:  Oh.  Well, I --
R:  But other than that --
L:  -- we -- we live in out state Minnesota, and it's tough right here.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, if you got a eight dollar a [LAUGH] -- an eight dollar an hour job, they think you're really doing something --
R:  Wow, yeah, that's how it is right here too.
L:  -- down here.  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  And you can hardly --
R:  I live in, uh, Erie, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, uh --
L:  [MN] So ...
R:  Yeah, same thing, um, if you're making, like, eight or nine dollars, you're considered high up there.
L:  Yeah.  Unless you're professional --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um [MN] -- which -- and you can't hardly support yourself on that.
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] No, but then again, the cost of living is a little less too, uh, than it was --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- so I guess --
L:  -- I guess Boston is high.
R:  Yeah, everything was very, very expensive.
L:  Yeah [MN].
R:  Things are a little cheaper here, but they have to be, because I'm not making near --
L:  Yeah, you just ...
R:  -- what I was making there [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so ... but, um ... otherwise --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know anything more about drug testing [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, no, unfortunately this is a topic I really don't know a lot about or --
L:  No, I don't know much about it.  That's -- it's --
R:  -- have a lot of passion about [LAUGH]. 
L:  -- [LAUGH] and, uh, I mean it -- they're blowing up -- or not blowing up, they're going in the meth labs all the time around here --
R:  Oh [MN].
L:  -- and shutting 'em down, you know.  People set 'em up in their garages and --
R:  Ah, easy -- pretty easy to make.
L:  Evidently.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  And, uh --
R:  And, uh, you know [LIPSMACK] [SIGH], it's big news.
L:  And they just make enough for themselves and a few friends, you know, they aren't out, really, going big scale on 'em, but I guess they're dangerous.  They could blow up.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you don't know what you're doing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, um, most of the people who are doing it, you gotta wonder [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] -- no, they --
R:  They're making it and they're blowing things up [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so ...
R:  Yeah, so ... yeah, it's not -- not the smartest thing people are doing, but --
L:  No, no, no, that isn't too -- too clever.
R:  [LAUGH] No, but [LIPSMACK] [SIGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  I haven't about any of them blowing up lately, but [LAUGH] [NOISE] ...
L:  No, I -- I -- no, here they're just shutting 'em down, you know --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then it come -- comes in the paper and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, see it on the news, like you said, or read -- I read it in the paper.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and kinda like, "Oh, yeah, another one of those" [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And the kids in school claim they can get it any time they want to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- drugs or meth or whatever they're after.
R:  Yeah.  And it -- it's not hard to find.  If you want it, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  And you got the money to pay for it.
R:  Exactly.  It's there for the taking.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I wonder, um, in schools, if they're going to start doing that?  Or if they've done that?  Drug testing. [NOISE]
L:  Well, I would think for the employees they would.
R:  Yeah, for the teachers, but I'm curious if they get the kids --
L:  Get the kids -- [MN] high school -- that's an invasion of privacy.
R:  Well, they can go through lockers if they feel --
L:  Yeah --
