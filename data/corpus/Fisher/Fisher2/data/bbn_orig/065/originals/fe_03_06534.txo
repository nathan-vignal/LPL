R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, I'm Michelle.
R:  Hi, I'm Kim.
L:  Hi Kim.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you today?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.  [COUGH] 
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Ah, Kentucky.
L:  Kentucky, well --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm your neighbor in Tennessee.  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, cool.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  You're not -- you don't happen to be a refunding makes sense --
R:  [NOISE] I'm sorry? 
L:  -- subscriber are you?
R:  I'm sorry?  [NOISE] 
L:  Are you a refunding makes sense [NOISE] subscriber?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] I'm sorry.  [NOISE]  
L:  That's okay.
R:  [NOISE] I got little ones fighting.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You got little ones in the background.
R:  You asked?
L:  If you were a subscriber to a refunding makes sense website?
R:  No.
L:  Okay. 
R:  I've never heard of it.
L:  Okay.  [several inaudible words] what is our topic?
R:  Ah, how we --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- feel about drug testing and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- whether we feel it's an invasion of privacy.  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Well, I'm lucky and I work for a very small company and don't have to worry about it.  But -- so it's kind of an awkward question but, um, if they were random, um, yes, I kinda do think it's an invasion of privacy.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I feel it's necessary. 
L:  Well, I feel it's necessary too, but I still feet it's an invasion.  Um, are you subject to that?
R:  Yes.  I'm a school bus driver.
L:  Well, I think that's very important [LAUGH] in your capacity.  Um, [SIGH] just personal opinion.  But, um, [PAUSE] do you drink?
R:  No, uh -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- no, I don't drink and I don't use drugs.
L:  You never drink.  Well, I don't use drugs but I do occasionally drink and fortunate that I don't have to go through testing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of any sort at work.  So, [LIPSMACK] anyway well how many of these [NOISE] have you done?  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] I'm sorry?
L:  How many of these [NOISE] have you done?
R:  Ah, this is the second one. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.  I've already, um, I did two and I got paid and then --
R:  I haven't been paid.
L:  -- and the month ended.  And I understood that you could only do three.  And then I got online and I started reading some messages that -- [MN] and then I emailed the -- Dave Miller.  I think his name was in the initial email --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, he said you could do as many as you wanted to do.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I emailed back and I said well, you know, to let me continue.  And they've called and I've been out of town and I see where they've called two or three times so hopefully it just keeps going and going.  But --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] I didn't know if you knew.  I got paid real quick and I know a lot of people that signed up a [NOISE] lot later than me still haven't been paid.
R:  No, I haven't been paid.  In fact, uh, um, I almost didn't accept this call because I thought to myself well, if I'm not going to get paid for this I don't want to do it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's so -- and oh, my friend that signed -- that encourage me to sign up, she -- I don't blame her, she was put out that I had gotten mine before hers.  But the man -- well has been so prompt and nice to me, um, you still have your initial [NOISE] email?
R:  I don't.
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  I wish I did.
L:  Well, do you have the eight hundred [NOISE] number for this [PAUSE] place.
R:  I think so.
L:  Well, you want to call 'em and just ask 'em and maybe they'll let you know what's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- going on.
R:  Okay, I'll try --
L:  But mine -- [MN] I got mine within maybe two weeks.
R:  Hm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'll try that.
L:  [NOISE] I can't find it.  So, how many children do you have?   [NOISE] 
R:  I have two.
L:  Two.  And how old are they?
R:  Twelve and five.
L:  Twelve and five.  That's nice ages.  And schools out?  Or almost out?
R:  Almost out.
L:  Almost out.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well -- 
R:  I go until, uh, June second.
L:  June second.  Well, what is today?  I'm just getting back into the real world.
R:  I don't know.
L:  The twenty fourth.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] You know, the [inaudible] the twenty fourth.
R:  Yeah.  We had some snow days.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  You all had I think more than we did but we had more than we've had in quite a while.  [LIPSMACK] So, [SIGH] well, [NOISE] um, I hope, uh, we get paid -- I hope I get again on this.  I guess I'm gonna not do any more until I find out and then --
R:  [NOISE] I'm on the telephone.  Go. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  That was the twelve year old. 
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- no.  Actually we were talking about the drug thing at work the other day, um --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they do random drug testing on us.  What they do is they, uh, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] we're pulled up out of the computer and the computer tells it -- tells them who to send for drug testing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, [MN] you know, of course you're tested up on your time of employment, uh --
L:  What does that mean?
R:  Uh, when you're first employed.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  And then we've got a random drug testing.  Well --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] our drug testing pulled someone up, uh, four times within two weeks.
L:  Omar[?] for what [several inaudible words] 
R:  And -- what did you say?
L:  For what?
R:  Well, it's computer generated.  We don't know for what.  Um, we do know that she had an accident though.  [NOISE] So, we're --
L:  Now --  
R:  -- figuring it may be, you know, they re trying to, uh, snag her.
L:  Ah, well it sounds like it.
R:  You know, I mean, I think that's a little -- going a little overboard, you know, but I all -- I honestly believe that drug testing, um, I believe --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it should be mandatory with all companies.
L:  Well, [LIPSMACK] the person that smokes an occasional joint, uh, that doesn't ever hurt anybody, that's going to hurt.
R:  Well --
L:  And I know that's not right to do.  But [LIPSMACK] sometimes people do it and things like that, it's no real -- well, you know, there's no poi- -- no, uh, no point in arguing in this.  Um, It's just a difference of opinion but I do feel it's one hundred percent necessary.  And it will probably come to that and that's probably what it should.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [NOISE] um, I'm not saying I disagree with you, I'm just saying I'm lucky that I don't have to go through that.
R:  I know.  I -- I think that, uh, [PAUSE] [MN] actually I think that some places are a little but, um, [PAUSE] [SIGH] too overbearing when it comes to it.  But then other places --
L:  Are l- -- probably lax.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Like my --
R:  Very much.
L:  -- m- mine.  Yes.  Never -- would never.  It's just small and it's just not something they do.  So, [SIGH] which I guess is a good thing but [LIPSMACK] well it sure seems like a long phone call.  [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
R:  [COUGH] I'm sorry?
L:  How long is this phone call supposed to be?
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  Um, [SIGH] so --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- this person is a school bus driver?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, four times in --
R:  In -- 
L:  -- two weeks?
R:  -- in two weeks, uh-huh.
L:  Well, that's not random then, you think?
R:  No.
L:  No.  I mean, the first time was and then I guess --
R:  No, but they're claiming that it's just randomly pulling her up.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What does she say?
R:  Uh, she's mad.
L:  She's mad; well I'm sure she's mad.
R:  You know, I don't -- I don't blame her either. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  She has, you know, reason to be.  I -- I think it sounds like -- but, uh --
L:  Yeah.  Here's my check right here as a matter of fact.  Five, five and un- -- I mean, I just find, uh, that came so fast.
R:  Huh.
L:  There's not a telephone number on here.  So, they do pay.  Um, there's a lot of talk --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- about it.  Do you have internet access?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  At my --
R:  I'm on it right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my coupons dot com -- are you --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  -- it's my -- M.Y. coupons dot com.  And there's a zillion diff- -- I love message boards.  A zillion --
R:  My two what?
L:  Coupons.
R:  Oh, coupons.
L:  My coupons --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- dot com.  And -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- [COUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- some of the boards talk about -- they talk about all kinds of things.  And you could -- once you sign up you could go in and search for the Fisher Study or whatever they call it and you would not -- 
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  -- believe 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- the threads on this.  Like zillions --
R:  Just a moment please.  I am on the phone for the fourth time.
L:  Huh. 
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  It's okay.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, may[?].
R:  Kids.
L:  Kids.  I don't have any.
R:  You can sign up for what did you say?
L:  My coupons dot com.
R:  Right.
L:  And if you like message boards.  And there's a zillion [PAUSE] threads on this Fisher Study.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, every time I go there's -- seems like there's new -- new ones that have been added and it's interesting to read.  My friend signed up in January and still hadn't gotten paid.
R:  Wow!
L:  [MN] So, this will be a good test though.  I'm going to make --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- note of this and if -- and the mon- -- ooh, and we luck out 'cause the month is over next week so, which means I ought to have a check within two or three weeks.  And you too.
R:  Mm, I hope so.
L:  I hope -- when's the last time you did one?
R:  Ooh, about three weeks ago --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or four.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, might have been this month.  So, you'll probably do four at the end of the month.  [PAUSE] Anyway, well --
R:  When do they pay?
L:  I think [inaudible] they stop at the end of the month.  [NOISE] They do some at the end of the month.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I wish I -- [NOISE] I don't have a copy of that.  I think it's on my desk.  But that guy's name is, Dave --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and they're real nice.  And they have an eight six six number and [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they should be able to tell ya.  I think it's all on the up and up.  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  [NOISE] 
L:  I just think maybe they got overwhelmed, especially when they put out a -- talk about it on the internet [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, message boards and, you know, everybody wants to make ten dollars for ten minutes so ...
R:  Right.
L:  But this thread had, like, four thousand views, huh.
R:  Hm.
L:  [inaudible] funny.  
R:  Well ...
L:  But it -- so your friend -- so what else -- did they just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- drug test her and that's it?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Your friend -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you're, uh, the other bus driver --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] Does that happen often?
R:  Um, I've --
