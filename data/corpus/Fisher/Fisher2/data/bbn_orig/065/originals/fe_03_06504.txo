L:  Hi, this is Janet.
R:  Hi, I'm Sheila, [SIGH] --
L:  Oh hi, Sheila.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um --
R:  Um, I think that they should be tr- -- televised, um, but I hardly ever watch television, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm not a typical respondent.  I read about them.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's where mostly get my --
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
L: -- um -- ah I guess high crime um, news from the newspaper. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I know a lot of them are on like, cable networks --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I don't have --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- cable, so the only thing I --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- really pick up --
R:  -- either -- yeah.
L:  -- is from the news, you know, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the highlights that -- that they have on at the --
R:  Yeah, the closest I've seen to that and it's not at all the same as Judge Judy.
L:  Mhm, yeah -- yeah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- Judge Judy [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] --
R:  And the doctor's office, well it's way different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where are you?  I'm in New York.
L:  I -- I don't -- I live in North Carolina.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And you said you live in New York?
R:  Yeah, I'm in Manhattan in --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- New York, New York.
L:  Yeah well, we're having a, ah, trial down here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in ah, Durham, North Carolina that's ah [NOISE] -- I'm -- I'm sure it's probably on cable TV, they just started picking the jurors, but it [SIGH] -- it's, you know, in the papers almost every day, and --
R:  What's it for?
L:  Ah, the Peterson trial, it's about a -- a -- a man down here who was a novelist [SIGH] and they claimed he killed his wife, ah -- ah throwing her down the steps and he says that she slipped and fell down the steps.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  So that's -- that's sort of our high pile --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- high -- high profile crime right now --
R:  Uh-huh, oh --
L:  -- but, like I said I don't -- when -- I'm sure when they start the actual trial, they're just picking jurors right now that --
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  -- it'll be on some cable network, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh --
L:  -- all the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I work during the day too --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I wouldn't catch a lot of it --
R:  Right, [NOISE] right.
L:  -- but I feel like if, you know, that's what they want of -- you know, if people want to- -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- especially, you know, for paid cable, if that's what they want --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, [NOISE] yeah.
L:  I'm -- I'm sure you can --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- probably learn a lot, you know, if you --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and maybe even helps ah, like law students and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and things like the -- you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with -- with their courses, so --
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  -- I'm sure there's a place for it, but it's just not --
R:  I don't know whether the OJ trial was really k- -- um televised or not, or that they just had sketches and all that reporting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] no but everybody seemed to know about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it, but --
L:  Yeah, they knew about Blosser[?] too, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- court -- it's up to the judge, whether he'll --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- allow that or not.
R:  -- oh yeah, definitely. [NOISE]
L:  So, like I said, that was of course, the -- probably the high profile --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- crime of ah -- or trial of --
R:  They could say that the television influences the jurors b- -- unless they, um, don't allow the jurors to li- -- to read, um, [SIGH] in the newspapers or look at the TV.
L:  Yeah, then they call the sequester in --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- sequester the jury, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And I don't think they -- I guess they don't allow them to watch telev- -- or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I can't imagine not allowing them to --
R:  What --
L:  -- watch some television, you know nothing perhaps to do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the trial but --
R:  I don't know.
L:  I -- I don't either.
R:  [NOISE] I know I was the -- supposed to be on the jury panel about t- -- a ye- -- two years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they would ask, you know, I mean, "C- could you be impartial?" and I had read about one of the cases before and the other one would have been [SIGH] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some guy who was accused of selling drugs in a school yard and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- felt he probably was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, no, I was picked for jury duty --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and put on a trial -- oh this has been about ten years ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um -- I mean it wasn't any high profile --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was about a man who was -- they cl- -- the state claimed that he was putting off road diesel fuel into his on road diesel -- diesel vehicle.  It was -- a tax issue's what it was, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um --
R:  So he was, um, getting away without paying the tax?
L:  Yeah he was -- you know, trying to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I mean, the -- the -- the diesel fuel's all the same, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's just whether it was taxes, what it was taxed for --
R:  -- [NOISE]
L:  -- on road use or not --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I -- I +learned something.  I didn't realize that you could buy diesel fuel without paying taxes on it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so like I said, you know, it was -- it was interesting --
R:  Uh-huh --
L:  -- but it --
R:  -- uh-huh.
L:  -- of course, it was [NOISE] you know, time consuming, having to take time off work and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] I know our court house is in downtown and it's hard to find a place to park, and --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- like I said, it's just not [MN] [SIGH] my -- exactly my cup of tea to have to [LAUGH] serve on jury. [LAUGH]
R:  I think the Eichmann trial in Israel was televised, if I'm not mistaken.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Lisa was reporting on it and that was very high profile.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then there was even a play about it, with Maximilian Shell.
L:  Yeah, and also the, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Oklahoma bombing, when --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- that happened, that was very high profile --
R:  Was that televised?
L:  I have -- like I said, I -- I know it was on the news like almost every day, but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't know if it was like on -- on cable 'cause --
R:  Uh-huh --
L:  -- like I said --
R:  -- uh-huh.
L:  -- we don't have cable.
R:  On Court TV or whatever.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure, like I said there was lots.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm sure the one on Court TV probably picks out some of the high profile cases --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the country to draw audiences.
R:  Uh-huh, I would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- expect so.
L:  Yeah, and there's people who, you know --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- they like to watch that type of thing.
R:  Yeah, oh yeah, I know I had a friend who was watching and she -- [SIGH] she used to watch that, she was dying of cancer at the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and she thought it was so educational to be able to watch.  [NOISE] 
L:  Well, like I said, I guess it can be.  I've -- I've --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- never, you know, actually sat down and -- and watched it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh, she liked it a lot, it was like entertainment for her, during the day I guess, it was better than watching soaps.
L:  Yeah well you know, those --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- can -- well you can get into those too. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I remember when I was in college, we got --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- sort of, into it, not when[?] as bad as some of the other ladies in my dorm, they ah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they would schedule their classes around their soap operas. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my god.
L:  So, like I said --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- ah -- but then like that was when cable wasn't that big of a deal, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that was just mostly on network television.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  I think [SIGH] cable has really changed a lot of people's lives. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  I find television mind numbing for the most part.
L:  Yeah, when there's not much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like I may as well do something else if I'm --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- gonna watch television but, [SIGH] you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I usually can find something else to do besides sit down and watch television.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah, I read or, you know, do other things, such as  [SIGH] 
L:  But once in a while there's something that I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I want -- like the -- the, ah, the Hitler movie the other -- the mini series that was on this past week.
R:  Uh-huh, how was that?
L:  Ah, I thought it was pretty good, I think it was quite tasteful what they did. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, you know, mainly it just went up mostly through his rise of power, not, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- through the h- -- you know, the in- -- right to the start of the war so it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- probably where they cut it off at, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I thought they did a good job. 
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Now, that would've been a high profile [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- criminal case if he hadn't have commited suicide. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  But um  [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, a- a- as I said, I didn't know whether or -- they seem to be familiar with all the players from the OJ case for example, um the prosecutor and the, [SIGH] um, Barry Shenk -- I think it's called the evidence or something like that, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] ah, file or company or something like -- something that points to, ah, you know, getting them exonerated --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um, certain one of the people from it came became um, a law professor and what -- that woman who was the prosecutor, is a court reporter today.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  You've sort of kept up with ah -- or at least heard about some of the lives after the OJ trial huh?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  I can't say you know after it -- I remember when it -- you know, the verdict came on and it was on network television --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I was at work and it -- 'cause it was, you know, during the day and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- about everybody at work, we went up to the break room to -- to watch --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what was gonna, you know -- what the verdict --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- was gonna be --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- although I can't say I was terribly surprised at what the verdict was.
R:  Uh-huh, well yeah, such a good [SIGH] you know, staff of attorneys and people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] working for him, it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- certainly makes a big difference.
L:  Oh yeah, certainly did.
R:  Definitely, you know --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- I -- I think it's a good idea to have the TV if it's permitted and if the judge permits it and the jurors and -- and the, you know, the plaintiff and the defendant's, um, attorneys don't, ah, object.
L:  Mhm.  Now, like I said, running [MN] -- it -- it does -- it can teach a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I think especially in -- in law schools and --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and things like that.
R:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE]  Well, they have moot courts also, in law school.
L:  A moot court?
R:  Um, where they um, they ha- -- they pretend to have a pretend trial --
L:  [NOISE] Oh okay, okay, I see.
R:  -- and sometimes they're even judged by real judges or law school dean who's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- very august. [SIGH] Um, a friend of mine's daughter just won one, over ten schools recently, I think it was.
L:  Well, even sometimes, even though they're not high --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- profile cases that like Judge Judy or -- who's the -- Judge Wagner I think was the one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- who started it in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they -- they can be sorta funny. [LAUGH] They -- I think --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they can be [SIGH] -- I guess that's more of an entertainment type of television, instead --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of informational type of television --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, [SIGH] and to still be[?] kinda lectures to the people once in a while.
L:  Yeah, well [inaudible] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Judge Wagner I think was the one who sorta so- -- well that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- was called The People's Court, wasn't it?
R:  Uh-huh, I guess so, I don't know.
L:  Yeah well, like I said, it's been --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- a while back when they started that, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then they've [NOISE] had several spin offs and things like that.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  This is my third, um, conversation.  How many --
L:  I w- --
R:  -- have you done so far?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh this is my second one.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  I guess I've -- well, I actually got one --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the other week after I signed up, and my husband had answered the telephone and he didn't know what it was so he hung up. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my.
L:  'Cause I didn't say anything to him about it.
R:  Oh, [SIGH] Oh dear.
L:  So I told him after that, I said, "Don't hang up, just hand the phone to me". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I chose this time 'cause I need [several inaudible words] and it's easiest time for me to get on the telephone to talk. [LAUGH]
R:  Sue, sure, definitely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah.
L:  So you said --
R:  I -- I wonder what it would be like to say, have a high profile case like the Enron case, or --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- this Peterson case in California.
L:  I don't -- I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  It'd be interesting.
L:  Yeah, I guess --
R:  Or this, um, Health Soft.
L:  What was the last one?
R:  And the -- um, Health Soft, it's a publicly held company where there are gonna be trials, I think there's been hanky panky and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- scandal with the stocks and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lord knows what.
L:  Yeah, I don't know if I've heard about that one.  Of course we've heard the Enron and --
R:  [NOISE] --
