R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, how are you?
R:  Oh, I'm all right.  My name is Rhea.
L:  Hi, I'm Nancy.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I have been -- I missed the first part of the question.
L:  Oh, well, the question was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, they wanna know how you feel about divorce and how it's affected today's lifestyle -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, how family values have --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- you know, increased, decreased --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- gone from bad to worse or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- good to bad or --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that kinda thing.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  [MN] Um -- uh --
R:  Well, [LAUGH] maybe I'm the wrong person to even ask that question [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, well, I mean, give your own, uh, feeling on it.
R:  [inaudible] fifteen years.  I seem to be all right [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, what do you think divorce as a whole has done [SIGH] in a family, if -- if -- I'm sure you know some people who've gotten divorced.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you see a -- a difference in behavior of children?  Do you see a -- a -- do you think they're -- they're -- they're good with, uh, divorced families?  Um --
R:  I think if they don't get along it's better to divorce anyway, 'cause I don't think the kids should be around that, you know?
L:  Right.  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Unless they start throwing blame and make -- trying to turn the kids against each other.  
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause that's where the problem starts.
L:  Right, right.  Um, I think, you know, I think some cases, um, I think, um, [LIPSMACK] a lot of times kids have -- have been kinda, in some cases --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I think some cases the kids have gone [MN], um, [LIPSMACK] um, [NOISE] gone astray because they don't have the discipline at home.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh --
R:  And then, yeah, the parents try to be too nice then --
L:  Mhm, they try to justify it --
R:  -- because they don't want them to hate them.
L:  -- by --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- giving stuff and giving 'em some more [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] and all.  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Instead of realizing those fourteen -- thirt- thirt- -- those first eighteen years [SIGH] you just have to do what you gotta do.
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah. 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  So --
R:  But they all love you later [LAUGH].
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  So, uh, I think, um, you know, my feeling is, you know, i- -- if, um, [MN] they still need that, um, in their -- in their life regardless --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of what the -- you know, the, um, situation may be.  Um, so, uh, I think that's kinda what they're looking for.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but anyways --
R:  But the weekend parent thing is not all, like, goodies and --
L:  Oh no, oh no.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] It's -- it's -- it's tough.
R:  And those are the ones who, yeah -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] mostly the one to spoil them on the weekends.
L:  Uh-huh, well --
R:  They never there for matters of discipline.
L:  -- and one tries to play a game --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, see who I can, you know, they -- they have these games, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, the one parent plays the game against the other, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I think, um, yeah, that -- that's not good either sometimes, so --
R:  Really.
L:  Um --
R:  Instead of both of 'em just realizing, regardless how they get along, they still need to do the best for the kids, put their heads together for the kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And don't let them, you know, use each oth- -- you know, play each other for them- themselves, you know?
L:  Exactly.  You know, [MN] I think a lot of times they do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they just don't, um, they don't always see it, so -- 
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- um, but --
R:  Sometimes they don't wanna see it [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you're right about that too, so, uh -- it's -- it's -- it's a tough call, you know.  So, uh, it's, um, it's just tough that the -- the kids get caught up in the situation like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's just the way it is, unfortunately [SIGH] so --
R:  And a lot of people don't even bother getting married.  But when they break up it's still the same kinda thing anyway.
L:  Mhm.  Oh yeah, because the kids have gotten used to having, um, someone around them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, I mean, they don't -- they don't necessarily understand divorce --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or anything, so they're like, "Oh, wh- where -- you're in my life today and gone tomorrow" so --
R:  Right.  And then it's hard for the other person to meet somebody else and just [inaudible] dating.
L:  Mhm, exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] So, it's like, well, what do you do? 
R:  [MN]
L:  So, anyway, um --
R:  That's why you don't need to bring 'em home anyway.
L:  Nope.
R:  If you're moving on with your life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you don't need to meet anyone [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  No, [MN] you're right.  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, oh [SIGH] --
R:  Just keep them out of it.  That's the one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You tell 'em, "I'm not introducing you to my kids".  And then you have those ones too that after they're divorced they wanna get another family and they tend to treat somebody else's kids better than they treat their own.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Um --
R:  They try to get close to the kids and [inaudible] takes the mother's heart, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  See, that's another game the kids get used as a pawn in.
L:  Right.  Um, so it's a -- it's -- it's tough on kids today. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, you know, they're just like they don't know which direction to go into.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So, uh --
R:  [NOISE] The whole institution is falling apart anyway, I believe.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  [NOISE] There's a lot of people that's not even bothering to get married any more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So -- so then they figure, well, "A couple of years and you're tired of one another --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] "-- and it's over anyway".
L:  Well, they take it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- a- a- -- take -- I think they take a lot of things too lightly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, so ...
R:  They get married for the wrong reason.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's like, "Okay, well, I don't like this.  I can change this by just moving on".
R:  Yeah, right [LAUGH].
L:  And, uh, probably not the --
R:  'Cause they know the --
L:  -- right approach but --
R:  Mm, right, 'cause they know divorce is right there, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah, it's easy.
R:  And that's why they even let --
L:  It's the easy way out.
R:  Yeah, they even make it easier too, with those, um -- what's that thing called, a prenuptial agreement?
L:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
R:  So, you not -- I'm not -- I'm coming in here with my stuff and I'm gonna leave with my stuff if it don't work.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  All right, put your name on this piece of paper, it's all good.  So that right there just shows they're not really ready to get married --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or they're getting married for the wrong reasons.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Mhm.  'Cause if you had to ask somebody to sign a prenuptial, you're not planning on being there long.
L:  You're right about that too.
R:  [LAUGH] You know?
L:  They had no intention, so ...
R:  Really.  Else they wouldn't even be worrying about that.
L:  Oh, you wouldn't even -- that wouldn't even come into the picture.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  That's true.
L:  But some people just, I guess they don't see it that way.
R:  Ha.
L:  You know?  But, yeah, they, uh -- I don't know.  They don't put any serious thought to it any more. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, it's like, "Okay, fine" [MN].
R:  And they get young -- and then another thing too, that you have someone who gonna be married three and four times.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Why go and marry them again?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  That's another problem [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  There's something wrong, you know [LAUGH]?
L:  Oh, yeah.  They don't see any problem with that either.
R:  Mm, no.
L:  So, it's like, "Okay, where did --"
R:  Someone just likes to get married [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I -- [MN] -- it's like, [SIGH] you just -- you don't -- it's -- it's weird how they come across this thought, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] but it --
R:  Then you got the ones that's desperate to get married.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [MN] Like isn't -- like being a old -- what is -- what do you call it, old spinster or something -- is so wrong.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You have your freedom, you're happy, you can come and go, and then you don't have no headaches.  And especially being with the wrong person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't need to get married if you're with the wrong person just to say that, "I'm married" [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] Yeah. But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think, you know, a lot of times they just think it's a -- it's a wonderful thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's -- well, I mean, for most of us, it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But a lot of people --
R:  [several inaudible words] You married yourself?
L:  Am I?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.
R:  Okay.  And we know [inaudible] when -- when you went into it, did you think it was gonna be a fairytale, like the princess and the pr- -- and the prince, you know, you ride off into the sunset?  You knew you had to work on it, right?
L:  Oh, absolutely.  
R:  See? [LAUGH]
L:  I think --
R:  A lot of people don't think that.  They just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they so blind with the love and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they don't really think they'll ever have problems.  And the first little argument, they're ready to run out [NOISE] [LAUGH].
L:  Doesn't work that way.  You can't run home every time there's a -- a little squabble.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they do --
R:  Mm, and --
L:  -- so, uh --
R:  -- you can't get your whole family involved in it neither.
L:  Oh no.
R:  [LAUGH] That's another thing.
L:  Oh no, no, no, no, you don't want that.  But they do.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, I don't.
R:  'Cause everybody got -- everybody got their two cents to add to your problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what you should do.  And then when you're alone, you -- you alone by yourself.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah. [SIGH] So, it's like you gotta deal with it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You gotta accept it the way it is, and [LIPSMACK] you'll have good days, you'll have bad days.
R:  That's right. [NOISE]
L:  So, um, but, hey [LIPSMACK].  So --
R:  You gotta be mature about it.  You gotta be grown about it [LAUGH].
L:  Well, yeah.  And some people are -- that's never gonna happen to some people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because they're immature to begin with.
R:  True.
L:  So, um [LIPSMACK] -- but, hey [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] hopefully these people find out what they're looking for in life.
R:  One day.
L:  One day, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, it's, uh -- it -- you know, nothing's easy.  You have to work at it, so --
R:  That's true.  If you want it --
L:  Yeah, if you want it to work, you have to work at it.  So, there's nothing that -- well, nothing's ever come easy for me, so --
R:  Mm, right.
L:  And, um, and I don't think it's, uh, you know, it's easy for a lot of people.  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but, um, anyway.
R:  Another issue with that too is that it's voting -- being devoted.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Some people are just not cut out to be devoted.
L:  Uh-uh.  You're right.
R:  See.
L:  No.
R:  'Cause they -- they seem like the ones that is more -- that wanna just go and jump into marriage the most, too.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't wanna be alone [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Um --
R:  So they wanna have someone there.  They're no good alone but that person is doing the same thing --
