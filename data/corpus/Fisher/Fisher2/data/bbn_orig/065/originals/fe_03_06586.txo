R:  Hi, I'm Pamela.
L:  Hi, I'm Carmen.  How row are you?
R:  Good, thanks.  How are you?  [SIGH]
L:  Fine.  Have you done this before?
R:  Yeah, I've done it twice, I never saw a check, though, have you done it?
L:  This is only my second time, how soon are they supposed to --
R:  Have you received a check?
L:  No.
R:  Me either, I was wondering about that.  It's been several months for me.  What was the topic supposed to be again?
L:  Oh, it's about the divorce rates, --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and then how it's affected, um, -- [inaudible]
R:  Has it affected you?
L:  Well, you know, I've never been divorced, I've been close to it, but I was widowed and then remarried, my husband, --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- um, second husband was divorced, and -- how about you?
R:  No, I've never been married and, the divorce, how it's affected me, I guess, my mom was married three times, my dad four, so, I'm kind of skeptical about it.  But I've been living with the same person for seven years, so, for me, you know, um, it's just -- ah, marriage is kind of just a piece of paper, I think, if you're going to be faithful and everything, you're going to be anyway, so --
L:  Yeah.  C- Can I ask you a personal question, then?
R:  Sure.
L:  Do you -- do you live with your --
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Oh, oh, really?
R:  Not currently.
L:  Ah, --
R:  Not currently, yeah, we both have our own home, so -- I didn't want him to move in, and it's worked out real well.
L:  Oh, --
R:  I get all the benefits and I don't have to listen to him snore.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's pretty good -- that's pretty, ah, rare!
R:  Yeah, I'm blessed, yeah, you --
L:  I -- I -- do you think that you having an asset has caused you to not move in?
R:  Um, yeah, I guess, if I didn't have my own house, I would have moved in with him, to be honest with you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, basically, because I have my own home, and it's nicer than his, I don't want to move there, and --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:   --I'm not ready to have him here, and he does all the yard work, and pays the bills and all that stuff anyway, here, so I really don't have to have him move in here.  He's here weekends, just not during the week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Well, I, um, I -- I -- my -- my situation -- my parents never divorced, but they're separated, --
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- but, ah, -- been separated for thirteen years.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, ah, being Catholic, they won't divorce.
R:  Yeah, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are they seeing other people, or --
L:  No.
R:  Wow.
L:  No.
R:  So it's not seeing anybody, huh?
L:  It's just a dysfunctional -- yeah.  It's a dysfunctional marriage.  My -- my husband's family, ah, his mother married five times, his dad married three or four times.
R:  Wow.
L:  And then he's a [inaudible] --
R:  That's scary, you being married to him, a little bit?
L:  No.
R:  Is he not tenacious, or is he tenacious?
L:  No, no, I think he actually was worse off in his first marriage.
R:  Wow.
L:  But I -- I think a lot of times you get a wake up call.  Um, -- do you have any kids?
R:  No, no --
L:  Okay, um, --
R:  -- children.  I'm a foster parent, though, I'm getting ready to have a foster child.
L:  Oh, well, see, the thing with -- with him is, um, he married, like, about a year and a half after his divorce.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, ah, I struggled with that because of, why would you marry, um, some- someone so quick if you've only been divorced such --
R:  Well, --
L:  -- for such a short time, but I mean, we talked about it, and I --
R:  I guess he knew what he was looking for with you.
L:  Um, I -- it was hard for me to --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- remarry because I was, um, um, --
R:  [COUGH] Oh, excuse me.
L:  -- I was widowed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't want to have to commit like that again.  So, I -- I --
R:  Were you happily married before you were widowed?
L:  Ah, no, dysfunctionally --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- married.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you mind me asking how he died?
L:  Oh, he committed suicide.
R:  [COUGH] Oh, I'm so sorry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Was that part of your relationship problem, or --
L:  No, he had -- he was stationed overseas in Sau- -- in the Middle East --
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me, I'm sorry.
L:  -- and he got, um, he got sick somehow.
R:  [MN]
L:  From, um, -- uh, he had two, two very serious illnesses that his -- his temperature went to a hundred and ten, and, --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- when a friend of ours discussed it with a surgeon, he said that it was, um, the neu- neurons fried and so he became psychotic, so, there wouldn't be -- unless he was -- if we'd found out about that, he would have been put on drugs for the rest of his life, and you know, I wouldn't want to sleep next to somebody like that.  [LAUGH]  So, like --
R:  Yeah.  You already have problems, [several inaudible words] they'll be even worse.
L:  Yeah, but I -- you know, I -- because of the d- -- the divorce rate, um, it has affected my marriage because we stick together because of it.
R:  Yeah, that's great.
L:  And so, we've taught our -- we have three boys and, we've taught them that, ah, --
R:  Oh, wow, is that your -- your and his children, or other people's?
L:  Ah, well, his first marriage, my second marriage and then one together.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and then, we have a daughter, but we've taught our boys that -- well, we don't believe in dating, 'cause we never date -- my husband and I never dated, we courted, um, and, ah, only because, and this is my point of view, --
R:  What's the difference, in your opinion?
L:  Well, when you date, you practice for divorce.  If you don't like that person, you end it and then you move on to the next one.  When you court, it's really a decision to marry, and then it's a matter of working out the kinks, but th- the goal is to get --
R:  How can you know that if you don't sample other people?  It doesn't mean you have to sleep with them, but, how can you know if you don't date?
L:  Well, I -- I think in, um, -- well, you know, honestly, I love --
R:  Can't you be friends with people first and then decide you want to court?  It's not like dating, I guess, if you're friends first.
L:  Well, I mean, I don't -- I -- I -- for -- for -- for  me, after I was widowed, I did not date at all, it was just totally out of the question, and so, when I -- when I was ready to, um, I guess, start dating, uh, we had decided early on, two months after, that we were going to get married, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I had to work out psychological things from my past.  But, see, I -- I -- in my point of view, we -- we have a -- we decide things, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's my point of view, we decide to love somebody or we decide to dislike somebody, and, um, and then, that decision to love somebody, then we have our criteria, what we'll put up with, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and what we won't put up with.
R:  I agree with that.
L:  And, so -- but, um, ah, --
R:  You think the -- the divorce has affected you into thinking like this, your parents' separation, not being divorced, or? [MN]
L:  No, because I, actually, um, it hit me, I think, seven years ago that my parents were -- they may -- may not -- not be divorced on paper, but spiritually, they were divorced.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that hurt so deeply.
R:  They're legally divorced if they've been apart after seven years, also.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So they don't have to go through all that --
L:  And so, but that -- that hurt me a lot and, ah, but my -- like, with my husband, because he did not want to -- family's very important to him, because he realized after the fact, um, which is why we -- we work so hard at -- you know, understand, we have our ups and downs, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, we're committed, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- till, you know, till death do us part, so, it's, ah -- it's, it's an interesting thing just to watch people, 'cause, I mean, think about it, um, like, if -- if -- if -- and I'm praying that it doesn't happen, but if my husband were to cheat on me, I'd have to forgive him and ask him do you want to work this out or not?  Because originally marriage was really set forth as a, uh, --
R:  See, there's two things I would never tolerate.  If someone, um, hit me, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I could never forgive them for that, if they're violent, because I've been in that relationship before, and I just -- I would never go there, and then, all, you known, if they basically hurt a child --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or my pet or something like that, and then the cheating part, it would depend, I'm -- I don't think I could forgive that either, because I feel, like, why be married if you're going to ch- -- even think about cheating, I think when you get to that position that, you know, you shouldn't have to, ah, tolerate that.
L:  But don't you think people who cheat already have in mind that they're going to cheat?
R:  Yeah, that's why I don't think they should get married.  I think people, --
L:  But I mean --
R:  -- like, with my boyfriend, --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I don't know if I would ever cheat on him or not, I'll be totally honest with you.  So, I'm not going to marry him, 'cause I don't make that step unless I'm hundred ten percent sure I would never, ever do that.  And I'm not, I'm not sure, so, that's why --
L:  Well, list- --
R:  -- I won't marry him, 'cause I would never put him through that, 'cause my dad did that do my mom, and my mom forgave him and then he did it again, and you know, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it broke her whole family unit up, and she left him and she should have, 'cause he was not only cheating on her but he was violent with her, --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- and I just don't -- you know, I don't think anybody should have to take that, but I think it's mental abuse when they cheat on you, and I don't, I don't believe in -- in your marriage, that -- that -- I think that's something that's kind of unforgivable.  It says in the Bible, you know --
L:  Well, what if, what if, what if there's no -- what if there's no verbal or, ah, -- violence in the house and cheating happened?  [inaudible] that?
R:  See, I don't -- I would never condone cheating in any position.  [MN] To me, the only unconditional love I'm going to have for someone is my pet or my child, um, I'm not going to have unconditional love for my spouse to -- if he cheats on me.
L:  But why is that, though?
R:  Because I don't believe in that, I don't think you should cheat on someone.
L:  Well.
R:  You should have enough respect for yourself --
L:  -- no, no, no, no, no.  Why is it that you would have unconditional love for your pet?
R:  Well, pets are innocent.  And children, you know, you bring them into the world, but with your, with your spouse there's no way I'm going to forgive someone that cheated on me if I'm woman enough to, you know, [MN] not cheat on him, then he'd better not cheat on me, that, if there's an issue, or he's thinking, "Oh, gosh, you know, let's spice something up, well, let's do it together.  Let's, you know, go, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- go do something different from the norm for us", but not with someone else.  There's too much AIDS and everything out there, and, you know, I just don't -- I don't, I don't believe in that at all, I mean, anybody, any relationship that I've ever, ever had, if I've found out the person cheated on me, no, you know.
L:  So if --
R:  Fool me once, you're the fool, fool me twice, I'd be a big fool.  And history repeats itself.  It's been proven in everything.  Um, --
L:  But -- but what if he -- but what if he -- how do you know if he loves you unconditionally, like a pet or a child?
R:  It doesn't matter to me, he doesn't have to love me unconditionally, all I'm saying is that I, --
L:  [SIGH] are you serious?
R:  -- I don't want -- I don't expect that of someone.  All I expect is that -- unconditional means no matter what I do, he's going to forgive me?  No, that's not right.  Everybody has parameters and I, you know, for instance, with my boyfriend and I, we both agreed that we would never cheat on each other, if we were ever going to something, we'd talk about it beforehand, and I know he would and I know I would, we would never -- we would never just up and do it, we're not that kind of people, we're both very ethical, and, um, I know if I married him he wouldn't do that, I honestly base my life on it, and if he did --
L:  Then how come you don't marry him, then?
R:  Well, I don't think you have to be married.
L:  This is really interesting, --
R:  You don't have -- you don't have -- you don't have --
L:  -- this is a very interesting conversation, by the way.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] you don't have to be married to have a commitment.  That's a piece of paper.  We've been dating for seven years.  We've been faithful to each other since the day we made the commitment, actually, and, ah, you know, wasn't the first day we met, no, but we are not -- we're not the type of people that have to have a piece of paper for security.  We're very confident, secure, successful people, and we don't feel like a piece of paper's going to make a difference, a piece of paper to show the world, or a ring on my finger, [SIGH] he's given me rings and
