L:  Hello?
R:  Ha. [NOISE] 
L:  Hello?
R:  Ha. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, this is Ethel, what is your --
R:  What --
L:  -- name?
R:  This is Christie. [NOISE] 
L:  Christie?  Hi.
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Hi.
L:  Okay, I understand that we are supposed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to talk about some criminal trials.
R:  Yes, televised ones. [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh, well, do you want -- do you want to start first or do you want me to?
R:  Mm, you -- you can start.
L:  [SIGH] Okay well, I guess, um, the first one we always think of is OJ Simpson of course. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh yeah I watched that one. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, I think the whole world did.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and also the -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- question was whether --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we felt that they should be televised.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  And you know, when I think about it, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] there's good and bad to it, um --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of it is -- I don't like because it's kinda like sensationalism. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] And um, I just don't think it's really every -- the whole world's business to know what's going on with some other people.  If I was on trial, I certainly wouldn't wanna be televised.  [SIGH] --
R:  I wouldn't either, that'd be terrible. [NOISE] 
L:  Right, but then on the other hand I can see the idea that everybody has a right to know what's going on, [NOISE] [SIGH] but my own opinion [NOISE] is I would prefer not to have them televised.  I mean I don't like things like [MN] -- it's almost like the National Enquirer, that kind of a feel to it, and I don't like that kind of stuff, so my own personal opinion is I would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- prefer that -- I don't -- I just don't think it's necessary.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [NOISE] It's true -- I don't really think it's necessary either, it's -- it's just, [SIGH] i- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it's an invasion of all the people involved privacy. [NOISE] 
L:  Exactly, that's what I was saying.
R:  Even the people that have to testify, like people that are subpoenaed, it's an invasion of their privacy.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I agree, I totally agree, [SIGH] and -- but you know, the whole world -- we all love --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sensationalism.  You know, it's the old story, you're driving by and you see a car wreck, you always slow down 'cause you want to see what's going on, it's only --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- natural, it's -- it's typical --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of all human beings that we're curious about what's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going on, so I mean that's why we love this kinda stuff, but it's so negative.
R:  It is, and I -- I'm -- I'm -- I've watched them plenty of times before, especially --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the high profile cases, but really, [LAUGH] I don't think they should do it.  I mean I just don't think it's fair to the people --
L:  No and I don't really --
R:  -- that are involved. [NOISE] 
L:  -- know if they, uh -- they can a- actually get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- an honest trial, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when it's televised like that.
R:  Yeah, it does seem that even -- even when they do sequester the juries and stuff, like it seems like it would just -- it'd be impossible to keep, you know, some in- -- keep it from influencing it in some way. [NOISE] 
L:  Right, that's what I think too, [SIGH] and um, I just don't think it's right.  [SIGH] Um, I just -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's funny 'cause I just yesterday received a -- a summons for jury duty for -- for downtown Los Angeles Court, and you know, I sent in my excuse for it and, you know, I just really would not want to be a juror.  I just don't like the idea of it.
R:  [NOISE] I know, and [MN] -- and especially think about it if -- if it was a televised trial, and you were --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- a juror.  [NOISE]
L:  Right that's what I mean.  Not just a juror --
R:  That's just --
L:  -- even -- I mean, people are innocent until they're proved guilty, but, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, say you or I were put on trial --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for something that they accuse us from -- of, I mean what a horrible feeling to have to go on TV everyday --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- and have millions of people watch you.  I mean it'd just be --
R:  It should be a private matter. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, and then the attorneys, it seems like it almost becomes like they're actors, you know they -- they have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- impress everybody and who knows if that's how they always would act.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Maybe they're doing that because they're on TV, who knows?
R:  And they won't let them trash their image.  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, and then that's also good for them because they figure they're gonna get really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good business if they win --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] so I mean I personally don't think it's proper, but you know what, ever since the OJ Simpson, I think now if -- if -- everybody's gonna wanna watch these big --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- trials of -- of famous --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- personalities.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, like I think when this Robert Blake trial comes up I think --
R:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.
L:  -- everybody is gonna wanna watch that on TV.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] And to me it's just kinda like such a waste of time and so many other things to do that are better in life than to waste your time watching this kinda stuff, it's just like reading the National Enquirer, [SIGH] that kind --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of a feeling, [SIGH] but then millions of people do that and that's how the -- they make money.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't understand why they can't maybe, you know, give a synopsis of what happened during the day instead of showing the whole trial, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] everything that goes on and -- and, you know, it seems like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it would be better.  I mean, I -- I don't even see how they can do that, I mean really.  [NOISE]
L:  I know, it almost seems like it should be illegal.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It really does.
L:  Because it's like nobody's business, you shouldn't [MN] know all the intimate details of everyone's life and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what's going on.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, too many things have to come out in trials like that, it shouldn't -- I mean in -- also, if you knew you were being televised and you were testifying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] wouldn't you be that much more likely to maybe lie, if you didn't want people to know something?  You know --
L:  Oh, of course --
R:  -- [NOISE] that's --
L:  -- I mean, I think I'd be embarrassed to death.  I mean, it's probably embarrassing enough to have to go to be arrested and, you know, for a crime but --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm
L:  -- to have to do it in front of the whole world, and then everybody knows what you look like and everything, and even if you get off innocent --
R:  [NOISE] People may not, you know --
L:  -- I don't know that you're ever the same.  And people always recognize you and will --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- remember you for things like that.  It's --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] just -- to me it doesn't seem right at all.
R:  It really doesn't, it's just -- I don't -- like [several inaudible words] I just don't see how it's legal.
L:  I know, I don't quite understand that either, somehow it doesn't seem like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it should be.  It -- I mean doesn't everybody --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  -- have the right of privacy, what happened to privacy? 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, just because you've been accused of a crime doesn't mean you did it.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know --
R:  And you lose all your rights.
L:  Right, it seems like, okay if you're -- if you're accu- -- if you did a crime, you should lose some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- rights, but I'm sure there's plenty of people that are innocent of crimes that they've --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- been accused of, and yet --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're losing their right to privacy.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'm not -- I don't -- I just really don't agree with it either.
L:  No, I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think it's right, [SIGH] but [MN] people love it, that's the thing.
R:  And as long as people --
L:  And --
R:  -- are watching it on television --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're gonna show it. [NOISE] 
L:  And then there's Court TV, there's people that watch that all the time, so I suppose [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, and all these different court shows on TV, you know, Judge Judy and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all this kinda stuff --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it obviously brings in a lot -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of people.
R:  But at least, with something like Judge Judy, the people that go on there, they consent to it beforehand.  They, you know, they -- it's um --
L:  That's true.  I agree, they consent to it, and it's also minor, you know, misdemeanor type stuff --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- which is no big deal, but still it's got that tinge of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sensationalism to it that people --
R:  It does.
L:  -- love, you know?  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Yes.
L:  And I guess as long as there's always gonna be people that are curious about what's going on with other people's lives, [LIPSMACK] [MN] that's always gonna be something that's available, [SIGH] yet it doesn't seem like we ever had this until OJ Simpson came along, did we? 
R:  It really doesn't.
L:  I don't recall -- I don't recall anything on TV, I mean --
R:  I don't remember when the, um -- did they show the Menendez trial?  Parts of that? 
L:  [MN] I --
R:  I don't know if that was before or after though.
L:  I can't -- I dunno.  No, I think that was before Simpson, although I'm not a hundred per cent sure. [SIGH] But I don't know that that was on TV, it wasn't like on regular -- you know the regular stations, maybe it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on cable or something.
R:  Oh ma- maybe they just showed clips of it.  I remember seeing the cr- -- you know the clips of the trial --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if it was on some kind of a Court TV or if it was just, you know, clips of it.  But it really, since ah OJ Simpson, it's -- it's just exploded.
L:  Oh yes, and now I think people are used to it and they want it.
R:  They expect it.
L:  I know, I think that's what I -- what's gonna happen with this Robert Blake thing, [SIGH] is people will be very angry if they don't get to see it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they'll say --
R:  That's probably true.
L:  "-- "Well, why did you let us watch Simpson for weeks and months?"  And who knows how long it lasted.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  That's a long time.  [LAUGH]
L:  It seems like it went on forever, doesn't it?  Gosh.
R:  It does.  But I mean, there was -- you know, even before the trial though there was like continuous coverage of the car chase and all that before.
L:  Oh, it never stopped.  Oh and that's all anybody could do, anyone could talk about.  I remember when it happened I [SIGH] -- it was on TV and I was so sick of watching it after like half an hour or something, I left and I went down to the park and it was deserted and it's usually -- you know, it's the park in Santa Monica where everybody walks in the evening, [SIGH] and usually --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's tons of people down there walking.  There was like two or three people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I an- -- they were all home watching this stupid --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [MN] car chase thing.  And this is how people get about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff like this, if it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- somebody famous.  [SIGH] So like --
R:  [LIPSMACK] People they --
L:  -- I said at the beginning is that, you know, I can understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people have the right to s- -- to see what they want to, but I also feel like people should have the privacy, [LIPSMACK] you know, who are on trial should have some form of privacy.
R:  [NOISE] It's just too much, the way they show the entire trial.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's just too much.  I understand that's a p- -- all public record, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's no reason to broadcast it on television for the whole world to see.
