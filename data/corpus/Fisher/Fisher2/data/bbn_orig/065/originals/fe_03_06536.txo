R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Carol.
L:  Hi, I'm Julie.
R:  Um, well regarding the topic on drug testing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I am totally for it.
L:  I am too.  [MN] Ah, [several inaudible words] --
R:  Because I think, um, a company should know wh- whether the person sick or some type of, um, narcotics.
L:  I think so too, especially for, like, safety reasons and well I -- I was in the army for twenty two years and I got tested -- it was, like, you might get tested at random once a month.  What it -- whenever they felt like it, you got tested.
R:  Oh, I also got tested.  I was also tested for -- for -- when I had to -- when I applied for a job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was just like for, you know, a corporation.  A lot of the corporations also do, um, testing.
L:  Where are you from?  Or where do you live?
R:  Uh, I'm -- [MN] well when I -- when I -- when I was, um, tested I was in, um, Florida.
L:  Oh.
R:  But the big corporations, uh, do test for drugs.  But I think, I mean, if -- if you've got someone in -- in a workplace doing drugs, I mean, that -- to me that's just going to decrease pro- productivity there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think so too.  
R:  I mean, I -- I -- I don't --
L:  No, I'm just asking; I'm -- I'm in Alabama but I work in Georgia.  I'm on the border and -- and every place here tests us. 
R:  Yes, yes.  I -- I just think for, um, production purposes of a person, I mean, if a person is on, um, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if -- if they're doing some type of narcotics, who knows what else they'll be doing.   [LAUGH] in that company.
L:  Yeah.  I think for safety reasons too because you could hurt somebody else on the job.
R:  Oh, yes, yeah.
L:  And I -- I sure wouldn't want to get hurt by somebody like that.
R:  I mean, I -- I -- I'll -- I'm -- I -- oh, right now I can only see advantages -- I can only see advantages to -- to doing drugs [inaudible] I don't --
L:  I don't -- 
R:  -- see -- I -- I don't have any disadvantage to it, like, if --
L:  -- I don't see that it's really an invasion of privacy.  I mean, if y- -- when they -- when you do a drug test they ask you, "Are you on any medications and stuff", and they do write that down so [LIPSMACK] I mean, if you came up positive for something and it's, like, "Oh, I'm taking high blood pressure medicine", or something, they would already know it.
R:  Right.  Ri- -- e- -- yeah, regarding invasion of privacy; no, I don't think so either.  [LAUGH] I don't think it's an invasion of privacy either.  I think everyone in there has -- I think not only for th- -- for that person; I think every other employee has the right to know also.
L:  Yeah.  That --
R:  You know, mayb- -- the boss, uh, wi- -- employ you.  They -- they should know if someone is in there --
L:  I mean, I figure if somebody's on drugs eventually it's going to come out, but I think they should know right from the beginning.
R:  Oh, yes, yes.  I totally agree.  I mean, I've -- I've had it done on me and I've ha- -- I have had no problem.  I guess --
L:  I've had --
R:  -- if you have something to hide then you [LAUGH] have a problem.  
L:  Yeah.  I've had it done on me; I've had to watch people because the military, they make you -- sometime you the observer.  You have to -- they make you actually watch somebody go though. 
R:  Ooh.  Really!
L:  It's not like you go in a separate room when you go like the employee -- most of the companies here, they just send you to the bathroom, and you go and bring it back out.
R:  Right.  But what I -- what I'm trying to figure out, why would, I mean, why would someone see that as an invasion of privacy though?
L:  I have no idea 'cause to me --
R:  Like, why would someone say, "Well, that's inviting -- that's invading my privacy"?
L:  I guess -- well I guess if you did drugs you would feel [LAUGH] that way.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, if --
R:  For a job though --  
L:  -- you did, I mean --
R:  -- I mean for a job --
L:  -- you would kinda --
R:  -- I mean, a boss wants to know, I mean, is this person going to come in sober every day?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess if it is -- if you was doing drugs, you'd probably feel different because you probably think, "Well, they don't need to know this.  I'm only doing this when I'm not working".
R:  Oh, that they're -- that they're not doing it?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  You know, like, if I was doing drugs I'd probably say, "That's invading my privacy because that's -- I only do it on my off time.  I'm not doing it while I'm at work".
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  I guess.  I -- I'm just trying to figure out how they could think of it.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I -- I mean, I've had -- I -- I -- I don't have any problem with it.  I mean, uh, if I have a problem with anyone else, I'd like to know.  I mean, --
L:  Actually, I feel better than -- when they do do dru- -- the drug tests --
R:  Oh, yes.  Me too.  Yeah.  Because I -- I feel like, you know, uh, it's just as negative, I mean, anyone that might be doing that in company, I think it's only going to bring in something negative to the company.
L:  Yeah.  I- if --
R:  And if it brings something in negative to the company; even if it's, like, um, high, you -- you know, like, uh, upper, you know, like, for the President and it -- I think it's just going to negat- negatively affect everyone [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  I think it would t- --
R:  -- in the company.  It's just going to be something negative of -- as a result to the company.
L:  So, do you work now?
R:  If I work?
L:  Yeah.  Do you work now?
R:  Yes.  Yes.  But I didn't ha- -- for -- for the job I have now, I didn't have to take any type of, um --
L:  Oh, you didn't?
R:  No, no.  I -- 
L:  I have to -- 
R:  -- I had to once in Florida.  When I --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- was in Florida I -- I applied for a job at a corporation.  The corporations do require, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the testing.
L:  Where you at now?
R:  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, and they don't require it?
R:  No.  I had no -- not -- I didn't have to do one here.
L:  Oh, 'cause every -- every place around here -- like I said I'm on the Alabama, Georgia border and every place here tests.
R:  Real- -- for -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- so testing is done for -- for every job?
L:  Every job that I've ever applied for and every job my husband has.
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  Everything -- 
R:  I did -- that I didn't know 'cause I -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- Florida -- I mean, I've only been tested once.
L:  I worked for a lot of temp places.  I'm retired from the army and when I retired --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I went to a lot of different temp companies until I could find a job and every one of them tested.  So, I think every place here does.  
R:  Oh, that's new to me 'cause in Florida I've -- I -- I also worked for temp and only one company required it.
L:  Oh, all of them here do.
R:  But I had no problem.  I had no problem at all.  I said --
L:  I had no problem with it.  But they -- they just do it regular here with just you --
R:  Ooh, okay.  So, it's by -- probably by law there.  Is it a law?  Each --
L:  I don't -- I don't know if it's a law or not, but everybody tests I know that.  [NOISE] I haven't --
R:  Ooh.  Oh, that -- I think that's great.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  I think it [NOISE] I -- I mean, I think a company that goes to the extreme of doing the testing, [PAUSE] I mean, I think that's -- that's great.
L:  Yeah.  But some of the temp services you're actually paying for it yourself because some of 'em, they make you -- they take it out of your first pay check.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Nothing like that part but [LAUGH] --
R:  I mean, if they said, you know, passed a law to do -- do it, I'd say g- -- I would say -- I would be one of those to say yes.
L:  I would say yes too.
R:  I mean, I wouldn't -- I would -- I would vote for it [LAUGH] 'cause I -- I don't see -- in Florida it's not every job.  It's not every job that you, uh, that you go to requires it.
L:  But a- -- [MN] uh, I -- I can't think of a job where you shouldn't have to have it.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- you don't.
L:  -- yeah, we -- I know there's jobs you don't have to but, I mean, if it -- [PAUSE] if it came down to it, I think most every job I can think of, they should be tested.  I mean, even if you're a cook, you could burn yourself or something and claim, um, like, disability to the company because you burned yourself because you was on drugs -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.  See [several inaudible words] true.
L:  -- or something, I mean, it -- anything.
R:  Yes.  That's true.  Yeah, 'cause I f- -- I --
L:  You could trip and fall and say, "Oh, it's the company's fault".
R:  Oh, and then you're saying it -- it was the -- is -- was really the person's fault?
L:  Yeah.  If they was on drugs, you know, and they came to work and they did something and hurt themselves, they could just say, "Oh, it's the company's fault", I'm going to file. 
R:  Oh, yes.  That is true.  That is true.
L:  So, I think they all should go --
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I don't see it as no type of, um, invasion.  I think everyone, uh, I think if -- if you're applying for the job you should be obligated to, you know, to do these -- to do these type of things.
L:  Yeah.  But, um --
R:  What type of privacy is there at a job, you know, that you're, uh --
L:  I don't -- I don't see none. 
R: -- I don't think being -- being on drugs is any type of privacy [LAUGH] I think everyone should know.
L:  Yeah.  Now I can kinda see in the military the way they tested because they have somebody actually stand there and watch you go from -- in the cup.  They have to watch it.  [MN] 
R:  Ooh, okay.
L:  But the military's --
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- a lot stricter.
R:  Yeah.  I s- -- I [several inaudible words] it's there for cer- -- you know, if there's a certain jobs, I mean, like, I figure, uh, yeah, the military, uh, medical, I figured in the medical field --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's probably required.
L:  Maybe they do.  All the other places I've been to besides the military, they just send you in the bathroom by yourself, I mean-- 
R:  Oh, well what about, like, poli- -- I'm sure police officers are required also.
L:  Yeah.  They p- --
R:  I -- I mean, I'm sure certain jobs, I mean, you can't be a police officer doing, you know, [LAUGH] some type of narcotic; that's just crazy. 
L:  I -- I wouldn't think so but from what you hear on the news there are some so ... 
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  [MN] So, I -- I don't know, I -- I -- I -- I personally, um, am all for it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Me too.
R:  I'm all for it and I don't see it as any type of, uh, invasion.  I mean, that's just my -- that's just what I -- I don't see it as it would be something like it, "Oh, it's invading --"
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- my privacy".
L:  I think the only people that would think it's an invasion are somebody that has something to hide.
R:  Right.  Yeah, like something to hide.  That's -- that's right.  I mean, I -- I guess since I don't have nothing to hide [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] It's no [inaudible] 
R:  -- I think I'm the most honest person going around.
L:  [LAUGH] So, how did you find out about this -- this Fisher group?
R:  Well, the thing is I don't want to cross time [LAUGH] you know, it's the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you're supposed to stay on topic on --
L:  We have to stay on the topic.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Ooh.
L:  It's hard when we both agree on everything.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, so -- so [several inaudible words] just disagreeing or what.
L:  Um, basically 'cause I -- I don't feel it's an invasion of privacy because [PAUSE] you're not doing, I mean, you're not giving 'em any information they shouldn't already know.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that the company and the people that work with you should know --
