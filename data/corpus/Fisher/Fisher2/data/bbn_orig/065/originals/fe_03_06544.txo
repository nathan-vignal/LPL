L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  My name is Chris.
R:  Hi, I'm Laura.
L:  Hi, Laura, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Uh, not exactly the most fascinating topic [LAUGH].
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  Ah, um, that was a surprise.  I really didn't expect a topic like that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I didn't expect a topic like that.
R:  Right.  Well, how do you feel about it?
L:  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] Very -- it caught you off guard.
L:  Yes, it did.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I guess I feel like it's probably the business' right to test, if they wish [LIPSMACK].
R:  That's -- I feel they should.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, why shouldn't -- come on in.  I've got a little visitor.  Hi.  Um, if you have employees wor- -- you know, your employees, like, you don't want them strung out on drugs. 
L:  Right.  Especially if there's anybody's safety involved.
R:  Right.  So ...
L:  I -- I know -- I used to work at a place where there was people on forklifts and people running cranes, and, you know, with vehicles, and a whole lot of people would go out at lunch and drink beer and, you know, whatever [LIPSMACK].  And, uh, it always made me a little nervous.
R:  Right.
L:  So ... [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean I feel, well, I mean if you're gonna do your thing, then, you know, don't do it on the company's time.
L:  Right.  Is this your first phone call?
R:  Actually, my second.
L:  Your second?
R:  Yeah.  My first one was on smoking, and I'm a smoker, so I -- I was like, whoa --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- okay [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I'm glad I didn't get that one either, because my --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- husband works for Phillip Morris.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  That wouldn't have been a good one for me either.
R:  Yeah, I was kinda -- yeah, this is my second one, and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I was like, hm, drug testing, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.
L:  Well, my first one was on hobbies, so that one --
R:  Oh, you --
L:  -- was pretty easy.
R:  -- got to do that one.
L:  That was easy.
R:  Yeah, I did -- I heard about that one, I didn't get to do it.
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you at?
R:  I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.  And I'm in, ah, North Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Where in Pennsylvania are you?
R:  Um, near, ah, Wilksbury.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  A little south of Wilksbury.
L:  Uh-huh.  I have, um, a bunch of family outside Pittsburgh [MN] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so -- but I don't get that way too often any more [SIGH].  So, d- do we have to talk about --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- th- the topic?
R:  I think, yeah, you know, it's like we're supposed to [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it's like, but we could talk about so much that -- you know, other things --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but this is recorded and they listen to it, so I --
L:  I -- yeah --
R:  -- don't know what happens.
L:  -- is it -- isn't it, though, just voice recognition?  Isn't that what they're trying to get?
R:  I don't know.  
L:  [LAUGH] I don- --
R:  I have no idea.
L:  I don't know if they're really interested in -- in what you say or, actually, or not.
R:  I mean, didn't we kinda like discuss the topic?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] We both [LAUGH] ...
L:  We both kinda had the same opinion on it.
R:  Yeah, we both feel like, you know, hey ...
L:  So, you have a [SIGH] -- a -- you obviously have at least one child?
R:  Yes.  
L:  And how old's that one?
R:  How do you know?
L:  Well, you -- I heard you say that a little one came in.
R:  Oh, the little -- oh, a visitor.  Yeah, her friend.  Yeah, um, she's ten.
L:  Uh-huh.  Um, I have a eight year old girl.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, gosh, believe it or not, we're -- we're out of school already.  They've finished down here.
R:  Really?
L:  But we go back so early, it's just ridiculous.  
R:  Mine's not out until the twelfth of June. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We have some time ...
L:  But we actually go back, like, the second week in August, so I don't know if I like this or not.
R:  Right.  Everybody else asks this, so I'm gonna ask it, 'cause everybody's shy of asking it.  Are you, like, with Refunding Makes Cents?
L:  Am -- am I what?
R:  Do you know Refunding Makes Cents?
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  The magazine?  Okay.
L:  No.
R:  I have to ask, because that's how I found out about this.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I saw it on --
R:  It's an online thing, and that's how -- and then I see other people hooked up, like they chit chat back and forth --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and other people with this study have hooked up with other people from the Refunding Makes Cents --
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  -- and they're like, "Oh, I talked to so and so from, you know, North Carolina, and so and so from PA".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "It was nice talking to you", and I'm like, "Oh, wow, small world".  Like they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you're not with them, so it's like, hm, okay [LAUGH].
L:  No, I do some, um, mystery shopping.
R:  Mm.
L:  And somebody had it on a message board, um, for that.
R:  I'm trying to get into doing that.
L:  Well ...
R:  Haven't done that yet.
L:  Have you gone to -- there's a couple, really just two main sites that you can really look, get lots and lots of information from [MN].
R:  I'm trying to think of where [SIGH] -- I'm registered with one [SIGH] --
L:  Um, let me see -- there's --
R:  Can't think of it.
L:  The, um, mystery shop dot org.  You can go to that, and you can put in what state you're in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it'll pull up all the jobs that are available for your state.  And then you can kind of look at the companies that are, um, working in your state --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then you kinda get a better idea of who yo- -- you should apply with.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I've only been doing it a couple of months, but, uh, I've had some really fun [LAUGH] jobs.
R:  So, like, do you use coupons?
L:  Um, no, I --
R:  Never seem to, or no --
L:  -- I do some, you know, I do a Sunday paper and stuff.  Um, but no, I really [MN] --
R:  'Cause that's where, like, I'm really big into coupons and that's the site that I learned about this from.
L:  Right.
R:  It's my coupon -- my -- I love my --
L:  Well, you --
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  -- know the wo- -- first woman I talked to from California, I think that's where she found it also.
R:  She might have said Refunding Makes Cents, or R.M.C.
L:  Yeah, because that was her thing, you know.  She was like, "That's --" 'cause we talked about hobbies, you know, and she was like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "My hobby, [LAUGH] my hobby is coupons".
R:  Well, the day [MN] -- th- that was like a few days ago, and everybody was talking that they had said the topic of the day was hobbies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they were all putting this on, and, like, this one talked to so and so and this one talked to so and so, and I missed that one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I didn't get to talk.  My first one was the smoking one, and I was like, "Okay --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- great, I'm a smoker, so, ah ..."
L:  So, there you go, there's my opinion.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [MN] but, gosh I -- um, just what a great way to pick up a few dollars, right?  Doing this.
R:  Well, yeah.  Unless --
L:  If they were --
R:  -- if they listen to our conversation, they're like, "Well, you know, they --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- don't talk about it that much, you know".  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I didn't --
R:  So ...
L:  -- on my first one either, so they -- you know, I -- [MN] I don't know.  I -- I think they just kind of give it to you to break the ice.  That's kinda the impression I got.
R:  They -- well, I think the thing is they want to see how two strangers talk to each other.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's the impression that I got, and then of course -- [inaudible] my husband just came in.  Now, my first one that I talked to, the smoking, was with a guy.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And, of course, my husband's like, "You're talking to some stranger", you know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and everything.  "Some strange guy, this is what you do all day?" [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's right [LAUGH].  Yeah, I make money talking to some strange --
R:  Yeah, you know.
L:  -- man on the phone [LAUGH].
R:  And I'm like, "No, the -- no".
L:  Uh, it sounds like they really need more men, um, to sign up.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] But, [LIPSMACK] um, what else?
R:  But I don't know, they -- I do want to try that mystery shopping though.  I've heard a lot about it.  I know it exists, it is legit.
L:  Yeah, yeah, um ...
R:  I want to try that.
L:  Yeah, it's -- I haven't -- you know, I just pick up a few here and there, and -- and it's really -- it's really been fun.  The other day I did a Olive Garden restaurant --
R:  Oh, god [inaudible].
L:  And, you know, they gave me forty five dollars.  They don't give you any, um, money, but they reimbors- -burse you up to forty five dollars.
R:  Right, you go out to eat --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then you have to have your receipt or something?
L:  Yes.
R:  And you get reimbursed?  
L:  Right.
R:  You might have to wait, like, thirty days or something, but hey --
L:  Hey, I know it.  It was --
R:  That's -- I -- I would be --
L:  -- paid.
R:  -- into that.  That would be great.
L:  I know.  It's not very often that I get to go out for a free meal like that.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] So -- so, yeah, it's been pretty good.  So, what is the site that you, um, go on?  That refunding -- does it -- is it just like everybody kinda puts in their off- -- what they're finding and stuff?
R:  Yeah.  It's refund cents --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- dot com.  I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you that now.  But actually it's a pay site, and they have a print magazine issue.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, I pay twenty five dollars a year and I get an issue every month.  It has all the current refunds, and you can trade coupons with people and refund forms, and they tell you all the good deals and everything that's going on.  And with that you get use of the website.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You could just have website access, I think it's like three dollars a month or something.  And they have chit chat, where everybody goes on, they talk about their good deals, their good finds.  You know, like everybody just saves money and they get stuff for free.  It's, like, fascinating, it's, like, "Wow".  You know, how does somebody go to the store, they get like two hundred dollars worth of stuff for, like, fifteen dollars?
L:  That's awesome.
R:  You know, it's like, "Wow" [LAUGH].
L:  You must have to be so organized to do that, though.
R:  Yeah.  I'm trying to get there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, I've -- I've just been doing this for a couple of years and I'm still, like, learning --
L:  Right, well that's pretty good, though.
R:  -- so much.  
L:  It's been worth your twenty five dollars, though, hasn't it?
R:  Yeah, it is, but, you know, for some people it's not worth it.  To me, it is.  You know, twenty five dollars a year, it's worth it.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And plus, it's kind of neat -- I'm sure you'd see the sa- same people al- -- you know, the -- like, kinda like talking to the same people over and over.
R:  Yeah, you kinda make friends, 'cause we do trades, like, through the mail.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, I have coupons somebody wants, and they have coupons I want, so we, like, trade for them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and stuff.  And you kinda do the same trades with people.  You get to meet people, you know, it's like, "Hey, it's you again, okay, well, I have this and that", you know.
L:  Do you --
R:  Marlboro Milds, people trade for those like crazy.
L:  They trade for what?
R:  Your husband works for Phillip Morris, so -- Marlboro Milds.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Huh.
R:  Your husband works for him.  Still waiting for my order.
L:  Oh, what'd you get?
R:  I'm sure he's not, you know, he has nothing to do with it, but --
L:  No, he doesn't.
R:  -- um, this was last year's order.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  I had a problem with it, and they just -- they called me about a week ago and they said everything was okay and it was ready to ship.  So, it should be here.
L:  Oh.
R:  Okay. 
L:  They do have some nice stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Every once in a while, they'll give him a --
