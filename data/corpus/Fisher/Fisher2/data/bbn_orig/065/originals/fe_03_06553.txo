L:  Juliette. [PAUSE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hey, how are you?  Who's this?
L:  Good, ah -- Juliette.
R:  Oh, that's your name, Juliette, my name's Eric.
L:  [MN] Where are you ca- -- where are you?
R:  I'm in California, where are you at?
L:  Sorry, I have bad reception, but I guess we have to talk about the -- the topic.
R:  Wh- what was the topic?  I -- I wasn't able to hear it, [MN] for the -- the -- the main topic, I don't know, something about drugs.
L:  Right, what do you think about it?
R:  About drugs?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I guess -- I dunno, do you do drugs or what?
L:  Do you think that they should [inaudible]?
R:  What happened?
L:  That companies should drug test?
R:  Mm.  It depends on --
L:  I don't think it's -- I don't think they should drug test for marijuana; I think they should drug test for stronger drugs.
R:  You think so?
L:  Yeah, I think that marijuana is similar to alcohol and they don't really test for alcohol, so I think that they should test for cocaine, heroin, vicodin --
R:  I know.
L:  All --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- those things.
R:  I have a question, but when -- when th- -- when they do those t- -- kinda tests, is it [LIPSMACK] -- for example, let's say that they found +marijuana on you, right, does that mean that you can do any other drugs stronger than marijuana only marijuana?
L:  No, I think they test for everything.
R:  For everything, huh.
L:  They test for everything and marijuana, but I think it's a certain level that they're looking for?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --
L:  Like they're looking for certain -- I don't know what the levels are that they're looking for.
R:  Because for exa- -- for example they don't test you when you're gonna participate like in a sport activity like in highschool, you know?  Or do they?
L:  Right, no, well some of them, if they're -- if they are, um, [inaudible] suspicious that you're doing steroids, they'll have you go take a test.
R:  Oh yeah, because when I played in my high school's hockey team, a lot of my team mates they were doing like -- I knew they -- I knew that they -- they smoked, you know, and they even did some other kind of drugs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they -- they never caught them, I don't know why.
L:  Yeah, but, I mean, I guess maybe they shouldn't test for drugs in the workplace, unless they're under suspicion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but if you're gonna do, like, truck driving and things dr- -- you know positions like that, then maybe they should be aware if you do have a drug problem, because then you can get into serious trouble.
R:  Yes, but do think that they should test you when you're going to apply for a job, or no?
L:  Huh?
R:  Should they test us when we're gonna apply for a job, or no?
L:  No, I don't think so --
R:  No, me either.
L:  -- because I don't -- people can --
R:  [MN] --
L:  -- do drugs and they can be very --
R:  -- work -- good -- good workers, yeah.
L:  Sorry?
R:  Yeah, they -- they can do drugs and they can have their own work, you know, their jobs.
L:  Right, they can be, like, very productive.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So -- and then, um, I don't know.  [SIGH] Have you done any other phone conversations?
R:  Well, I did one, the day before yesterday I think I did one.
L:  What topic was that?
R:  Should people panic in a terrorist attack.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  What about you, have -- is this your first one?
L:  No, this is my first one.
R:  Oh this is your first one?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, so this is your first one huh?
L:  Yeah, this is my first one, but it's an interesting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- subject, because --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- [MN] I mean, unless you're gonna do really hard drugs -- like I don't -- I got tested --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I got drug tested when I worked for Harley Davidson.  I don't think they should drug test you for that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you're just gonna do a retail job, I don't think they have a reason to test me.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [several inaudible words] and now I have a proper job they don't want to drug test me.
R:  But did they do a drug test on you or no, they did?
L:  No.
R:  They didn't?
L:  Wh- when I worked -- when I worked retail they did a drug test, but [several inaudible words] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for my corporate job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So maybe corporate jobs they have more -- you know, they think you're more mature.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Mm, mm, but, I mean, I know I have a lot of friends that do drugs, and won't -- can't get stupid[?] jobs, because they do drugs and they drug test them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, I mean that's just -- I mean -- what do you think, do you think that it's a -- that they should have the right to drug test you any time they want?
R:  Well, it depends what kind of job, like you say, you know, if you're gonna be -- if you're gonna be like a drive test teacher, or something -- an instructor, they should do it, but otherwise, if you're just gonna be dealing with people, you know like, it's not gonna -- not gonna affect you, they shouldn't be doing that, for example -- no they shouldn't.  Unless you're gonna be driving a -- like a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- truck driver, or something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that deals like -- that'll put your life in --
L:  Or like a -- people in the hospital.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Those peo- -- like nurses and doctors should be constantly drug tested, because don't -- a lot of them -- or policemen should be drug tested and firemen and paramedics.
R:  They should be? [MN]
L:  But not basic people.
R:  I -- I dunno, are -- are they drug tested or no?
L:  Oh I think so, I think doctors, nurses and um, firemen and paramedics, I think they're routinely drug tested and like people in the military get drug tested every so often.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  And so -- but I don't think for like McDonald's that they should drug test you, because those are petty jobs.
R:  Do you think they should?
L:  No, no, I don't think they should.
R:  No they shouldn't -- they shouldn't, if you work at McDonald's they shouldn't want -- why would --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they, you know?
L:  Yeah, I know, definitely, it's not like that at all to be drug tested.
R:  Yeah 'cause I work in the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- supermarket and they don't drug test you to work in a supermarket.
L:  Well, some dr- -- what supermarket do you work in?
R:  I work in, um, it's called Valley Food Warehouse.
L:  Okay, but like Everson's and Bond's and Ralph's, they drug test.
R:  They do?
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah, they probably do, because they're like, bigger organizations you know?  Like the -- they're --
L:  Yeah, they're --
R:  -- like --
L:  -- corporations --
R:  -- yeah --
L:  -- and they don't want to be sued.
R:  Yeah, that's why, that's why, exactly that's why, 'cause they're corporations so they need to, yeah --
L:  'Cause they think -- they think the worst of people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they don't want to be sued, just so -- in case someone's--
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing drugs or whatever, but I mean how could -- I don't get how people can drug test because what if you've only just had the drug once?
R:  Yeah, but for -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I don't know, [MN] yeah, they shouldn't really drug test you anyway, but, [SIGH] why -- I think -- do you do drugs or what?
L:  And marijuana stays in your system for twenty eight days.
R:  Yeah, that's quite a while, you know.
L:  I know, so, I mean it's like -- and then -- I think like cocaine and the other ones, they go out of your system faster.
R:  But I -- I -- I dunno, I've never done drugs like that, you know.
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  I've never -- I mean, I've smoked marijuana, but I've never done cocaine or heroin or anything.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  But I mean, I don't know, it's a very touchy subject with a lot of people.
R:  Yeah, it depends what kind of -- it depends -- obviously the people that do drugs, they don't wanna be tested at all, you know?  But if --
L:  Right, but I mean --
R:  -- and even the people --
L:  -- but -- but then again --
R:  -- that don't do drugs, they don't --
L:  -- like, they --
R:  -- wanna be --
L:  -- should just legalize marijuana, because it's the same as smoking a cigarette.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, that's just -- and you can -- I think you can have a certain level of marijuana in your urine, [NOISE] but I'm not sure, but that makes -- it forces people to go get other people's urine or try and drink some nasty drinks or something to try and get it out of their system.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I dunno, but, yeah -- yeah because marijuana is supposed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be legalized, you know?  It's supposed to be legal, but it's just that people, they choose to abuse of it, you know?
L:  Yeah, right, no.
R:  But when peop- -- but when -- like when ah, [SIGH] 'cause like you know if you go like to those other countries, like South America, no, they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're legal over there.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and in Amsterdam it's legal.
R:  It is?
L:  Marijuana's legal.
R:  Ooh, oh it is?  I didn't know that.
L:  Yes, you bo- -- you can buy marijuana like you can buy a pack of cigarettes.
R:  Hm, that's pretty good.
L:  Yeah, but, I mean, that's the only country it's legal in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then I mean, it's legal for medical use, people use it for, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] to -- it's like -- AIDS patients and everything, they use it for pain, you know --
R:  Pain reliever, yeah.
L:  -- instead of -- yeah, instead of using vicodin or something else, or -- you know, it's chemically balanced so, I mean, I don't think people should be drug tested in the work place.
R:  Yeah, they -- they really shouldn't, 'cause you know -- yeah.  They shouldn't.  
L:  I mean, it's not worth it, so --
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  How many are -- so how many more of these do you do?  Do you do one more of these?
R:  Yeah this -- this my second one, so I guess I'm only allowed to do three of them.
L:  And then they send you a cheque for ten dollars?
R:  Yeah, for ten dollars for each conversation that you had, you know, so it'll be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like thirty dollars.
L:  Oh that's cool.  Where did you see it, did you see it on Craig's List?
R:  No, I saw it at my college.
L:  Oh, where do you go to school?
R:  I go to LA Valley College.
L:  Oh okay, where --
R:  What about you, where -- where do you go to --
L:  -- do you study -- I'm done, I have a bachelor's in marketing.
R:  Oh that's pretty good.
L:  Yeah, it's cool.
R:  Do you -- you live in California, or some other state?
L:  Huh?
R:  Where -- what state do you live in, like?
L:  I live in Marina Del Ray. 
R:  Ma- Marina Del Ray?
L:  Sorry?
R:  Marina Valley, where's that at?
L:  Marina Del Ray, um, like near Venice?
R:  But -- but it is in California, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, [MN] Venice Beach.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.  Oh, that- that's pretty cool.
L:  I live near Venice Beach.
R:  Oh that's pretty [SIGH] [MN] --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  It's a pre- -- [MN] --
L:  How was the -- how was the -- what did the person say about terrorism and panicking?
R:  About what?
L:  The terrorism and panics?
R:  Yeah, what is it?  Well --
L:  That was the other topic that you had to discuss?
R:  Yeah, the one that I had, the first one, yeah.
L:  How was that, was that interesting?
R:  Um, it was interesting but there really isn't a lot to talk about, you know, 'cause it's either that people panic when something happens, you know?
