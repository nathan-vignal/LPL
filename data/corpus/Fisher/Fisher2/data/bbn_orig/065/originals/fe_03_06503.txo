L:  Hi.
R:  Hello, I'm Barbara.
L:  I'm Genna.
R:  Have you watched many criminal trials?
L:  You know, I haven't watched too many but I can say the big one I've watched is the O.J. Simpson trial.
R:  I think we all watched that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Of course.
R:  [LAUGH] We couldn't miss it, could we?
L:  [LAUGH] No.  It was on every channel.
R:  And, uh, if you missed some of it, it was on the evening news.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... [MN] do you think that influenced the outcome at all cause they made it too media ... or ...
R:  I really don't know that it did.  I sort of thought that, uh, the jury maybe e- ... was the one that decided that completely.  What do you think?
L:  [NOISE] Well, I'm not really sure because I know the jury was completely secluded and what not and put up in their hotels and, you know, not allowed to have outside contact but ... you were still able to watch the news and what not and even if media casters try not to put a bias onto what they're saying, whatever opinion they tends -- they -- during their broadcast sends a bias so ... I don't know.  I'm not really sure.
R:  I read a book about that trial.  Uh, about the jury and, um, in the book they seemed to think, this was the book's idea, the fact that they allowed them to see their sex partners, uh [SIGH] with visits, they brought a lot of information into them that way because they'd been watching the trial.  Of course, I don't know if that's true.  That was the idea in the book.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if you do see people who have been watching the trial, they're gonna talk about it.
L:  Of course.  I wouldn't want everyone's topic of conversation, you know, is he innocent or is he guilty?  And --
R:  And then the day that the jury brought in the verdict I think everybody in the country was watching.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think so too.  I actually go to U.S.C. so, you know ... O.J. is a graduate of U.S.C.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  That's a big ... big thing.
R:  [inaudible] -- and he was so well known all over the country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- if he wasn't well known he was before that was over with.
L:  Right.
R:  And of course, everything he's done since has been publicized.
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.  He has no private life anymore. [NOISE]
R:  Uh --
L:  Well, I mean ...
R:  There's one whole channel devoted to that, isn't there?  To trials?
L:  A what?
R:  Criminal trials?
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  I -- I seem to remember that there was.  I haven't watched it but I have ... I seem to remember that there's one channel.  [SIGH] I'm trying to think of the name of what they call it.  But, uh, anyway they have big criminal trials constantly.  Some states don't allow it do they?
L:  Um, I'm not -- I don't know.  I [LAUGH] [inaudible] the other state laws.  Where do you live?
R:  West Virginia.
L:  Uh, I'm California.
R:  We haven't had ... you have had trials big enough, like O.J.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I don't -- I don't think we've had a trial in this state important enough for coverage so I don't know whether it could be covered in our state or not.  The ju- --
L:  Yeah, I don't know --
R:  The judge decides, doesn't he?  Whether he, uh --
L:  The final verdict or if it's okay?
R:  If it's okay to bring --
L:  Um --
R:  -- cameras into the courtroom.
L:  I -- I do believe that that is up to the judge, yes.  I'm not really sure though but --
R:  We haven't had much of that here but you certainly have had in California.
L:  We have our fair share of it, yes we do.  [LAUGH] Um, do you think it sends like a -- a message out or anything to like other criminals, like, if they see how other lawyers or whatnot get people off, like ... how they can get off?
R:  Yes, and it might encourage them too to want more high profile lawyer.  And who the high profile lawyers are that are able to do it.  Of course, we have enough of those on TV.  What is it they call 'em?  Talking heads?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That tell us what to expect in trials.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, some of 'em have made a whole, uh ... living out of doing that.  I don't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- think they practice law much anymore.
L:  Yeah, I think you kinda lose the art of actual law.  I don't know.  Um ... when they are televised it seems that they become more like a charade or circus that's like who can be better at doing their job, you know?  I mean, they're supposed to be anyways but I don't know.
R:  What was the name of the judge in O.J.'s trial?
L:  I actually don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, he ... became almost an actor acting for the camera before it was over.  Um ... I remember --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he was married to a policewoman, wasn't he?
L:  I actually don't remember.  Just, I don't know.  It seems that these are things that should be kept ... private until the final verdict or what not so that there are no outside influences.
R:  And you don't think of the judge acting like that either, becoming a regular actor.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  It was a very short name.  I keep thinking Ito[?] but that wasn't quite right.  Was it U- Uto[?]?  No, that's not right.  I can't think of his name.  Uh, names are my problem.
L:  Yeah, I never really remember names. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Sometimes I think I'll forget my own. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But O.J. we remember.
L:  Yeah, well, that's an easy name.
R:  And --
L:  And he just u- --
R:  And we heard it so much.
L:  Yes.  O.J. Simpson -- O.J. Simpson trial, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
R:  And we've heard a lot about what he's done since the trial too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Course there was a second trial, wasn't there?  In which, um ... her family sued him for damages.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Won and they've never collected.  Was that televised?
L:  I don't think so.
R:  No, I don't remember it being televised either so it probably wasn't.
L:  I don't care if it's not murder or ... basically if it's not murder.
R:  I -- I think there's been a lot of interest in murder of children.  There was a murder [inaudible] ... and I can't think of the name once again.  A ha- --
L:  There was the Polly Cross trial.
R:  Yes, that's the one I was trying to think of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When a child's involved it's very interesting too.
L:  Richard Allen Davis.
R:  Yeah.  Did that --
L:  I don't have a lot --
R:  Uh, was that in your state?
L:  That was.  That was actually by, um, my hometown where, um, they found it very close to my hometown so ... that one hit close to home but there was also controversy with that one too because they found that the best friend was tied up and didn't scream or anything until she was able to untie herself and like ... so ... it seems that these trials are never quite clean trials.  I don't know if that's because of ... media wanting to give it more of a [inaudible] to gain interest or ... or just the media's twist on what they want you to think?
R:  Well, uh, in every life there are some things that if you dig deep enough can cause all kinds of questions and when you have a trial like that, they dig deep enough to find all those things.  You may have had a relative that you wish you hadn't had or something like that.  And when you have a high profile trial, they go into every bit of that or if you become a very important political figure.
L:  Right.
R:  Like we've seen our President's relatives, um ... we dig into their lives and so on and I don't know that that has anything to do with the President.
L:  Like, Genna Bush and her alcohol M.I.P.?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then Bill Clinton had a brother.  What was his name?
L:  I don't know.
R:  That likes alcohol.  I can't remember his name [LAUGH] at all but he did some things that, uh, caused embarrassment.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I think that's what happens in a trial too and they bring all of those things in and then we're thinking about those things.  They may not have had anything to do with what happened at all.
L:  Right.
R:  I think of some of the relatives in my family that I wouldn't want their whole lives spread across the, uh ... TV screen.  And I --
L:  No.
R:  -- think most families have those.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  You no longer tried it.
R:  So, publicity can really hurt and ... having a TV trial is about as public as anything can be.
L:  Mhm.  And I -- I dunno.
R:  We have a case that doesn't have anything to do with the trial --
