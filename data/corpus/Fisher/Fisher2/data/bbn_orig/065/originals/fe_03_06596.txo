L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [inaudible].  My name is Kevin Gonzales.
L:  Hi.  This is Carol.
R:  Carol.  Okay, Carol.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, that was fast.
R:  Uh, hello?
L:  Yeah, I'm here.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Um, so do you think that public or private school have the right to, what is it, dictate what books are being read?
R:  Um, to me I -- I, you know, as a -- if I was a parent I would be slightly concerned about what books my -- my children -- my -- my children would be reading.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know.  'Cause I don't want them, you know, picking up on the wrong sort of information and then something that -- that might somewhere down the line --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, I'm thinking that if -- if, um, a school is recommending a book or wants them to read a certain book, it's for a reason.  I mean, if you've -- if you have a, you know, what you think is a good school, they're not going to -- I mean, what would they have them read, you know, that would be so bad?  [LAUGH]  Catcher in the Rye?  I mean, what would you think a bad book would be?
R:  Well, I don't -- you know, I -- what a bad book would be, depending on the language of the book or something that's not positive -- uh, not positive statements.  Negative statements [inaudible] stuff like that.  You know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, you know, I would -- I would, you know, there's, uh, you know, you want your kids to, you know, not to pick up on negative stuff or negative ideas, you know.
L:  Well, sometimes the world is negative, you know.  Huckleberry Finn.  I mean that's -- that's negative.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's true.
L:  [MN]
R:  But in a way, you know, just 'cause the world's negative doesn't mean you have to be.  
L:  Huh?
R:  Just 'cause the world's negative doesn't mean you have to be.  
L:  No, of course not.  No, you don't have to be negative just 'cause the world is.  But, you know, I mean, [MN] books are read for different reasons.  I mean, like, for instance, Huckleberry Finn, [MN] you know, the adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  Look at how big it [MN] -- it is, you [LAUGH] know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And how the N word is used all the time, you know.  Um, some people wouldn't want their kid reading that.  You know, because they don't want them to be exposed to -- to, um, racial slurs.
R:  Well, [MN]
L:  If they've never heard them in their home before.
R:  Yeah.  Well, today, it seems to me on television, or whatever it is, or -- you might, you know, you -- you pick up on the street.  Pick it up on your [MN] -- you know from your friends friends at, you know, depending, you know, [MN] there is -- there's racial [MN], you know, slurs in -- in com- in commercials.  I mean, it's -- there's -- there's a lot out there.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] 
R:  You still have to watch.
L:  So my point exactly.  They're going to hear that in the world so, I mean, if a teacher is picking a specific book, you know -- and also it's up to the parent --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to have a hand in -- in the child's, uh, education too, you know.  I mean, it's up to the parent to say, okay, to talk to the -- to read the book as well and talk to your child about the book, because nine times out of ten, or at least eight [LAUGH], what the parent's opinion is is much more important to a child, um, than a teacher.  Well in grade school [LAUGH] anyway.
R:  Mm.  I believe that, you know, that the parents pa- -- parents have a big part to play in the -- in the upbringing o- -- upbringing of your, you know, your chil- your child, your -- your daughter, your son.  You know, you sort of have to know exactly what's going on in school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What they're learning.  Or, you know, what kind of -- what, you know -- what, you know -- [inaudible] maybe you want to meet their friends to see what kind of -- what's the language that they're using around [MN] your sons and daughters, you know.  So you get a general idea so maybe instead of, uh, being negative you can sort of get some feedback into them and say [MN] -- and you can talk to 'em about the language and something and you can sort of say, you know, sort of --
L:  Oh, of course, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  So, I mean [SIGH] -- I mean this is still America, you know, where we supposedly have free speech, although, you know, it's getting taking away more and more.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, without us even realising that it is.  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's going to, um, [MN] you know, for instance they have corporations that want to, um, have, uh, you know, beam their messages into classrooms via the, you know, television learning.  You know, that's another kind of book, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.  Um, you're talking about big corporations though?
L:  Huh?
R:  You're talking about big corporations?
L:  I'm sorry still didn't hear you, what?
R:  Are you talking about big corporations are trying to, uh, have this input into, like, children's lives or something like that?
L:  Exactly.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, for instance, would you say that a book about, uh, um -- the Microsoft guy, Bill Gates.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you think that would be an appropriate book for children to read?
R:  No.  Because, yeah, I think he -- he -- he's got -- he's got something that's, uh, a book that he wrote called, There's Something to, um -- Something to [MN] -- you know, to Highway or [MN] -- you know, it's -- he's -- Bill Gates has put out a couple of books in general.  I guess it's basically trying to get chil- -- people trying to [inaudible] children.  You know what I'm saying?  Something about the information highway.  Which is --
L:  Trying to give them what?
R:  Trying to learn something about the information highway.  The internet, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  And then, you know, when it comes to computers you, it's -- it's -- well, you know, you could pick up -- you could pick up a whole lot of stuff on computers too.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [several inaudible words] -- you got to, sort of, monitor when it comes to your -- your -- your children.  You want to know what they're listening to.  What is it they're -- they're --you know, they're -- they're -- what the -- what the program is.  You want to -- you -- you want to be able to --
L:  Absolutely.  I mean, so I think we're in agreement that a -- a parent [MN] in terms of, um, having input into what their children are reading --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  Excuse me.  Not only is it their right [MN] -- excuse me -- but it's their responsibility.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [MN] parents [inaudible] --
L:  To pay attention to what their children are reading in school.  
R:  Mhm.  Parents do have to take responsibility with their children today.  They -- they have to take a big part when it comes to education.  It's not just -- it's not just [MN] you know, it's not just about the teacher, you know.  It's like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] parents think that, you know, consider -- if you send your kids to school, you know, that's all there is to it.  You know, and they really don't play a part in -- in education.  Like for instance, I -- I had that kind of upbringing where my mother would send me to school and, you know, she -- I mean, she had to go to work so she really didn't have time really to sit around and try to, uh, get into my education [several inaudible words] what I was learning in school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, in a way that creates a problem because, you know, you don't know what's going on with -- in -- in your children's education.  That they're -- that they're lacking in math or they're lacking in reading, or stuff like that.  You know, you don't -- you don't know that.  And then, you know, and the -- the grades are not up and, you know, it's -- uh, something's going on.  Something's not right.  [MN]  So you sort of have to play a part into that.  Like my nephew had a problem reading and I -- you know, and one time I sat down with him and I was -- listen to read and he was having trouble reading and so I -- so I spoke to my sister and said, "Well, you know, something's wrong, you know, with him because he seems to be a little, uh, slow.  He may need -- he may need a special class or something, you know.  Maybe he's in the wrong sort of [MN] classroom where things are being taught at such a speed that he can't -- he -- he's not been -- he's not able to keep up with it".  And I told -- I -- you know, so we got discussion and she said, "Well, I'm going to the school and I'm going to talk to the teacher and see what she has to say about this, you know, what's going on with him".  And [several inaudible words] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to find out that he had -- he was a little something -- he had something -- some kind of condition or something that, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely you have to take a part.  [LAUGH]  And you have to [MN] -- uh, it's a little bit harder in public schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  But you have to force them to test your child for learning disabilities.  You pretty much have to force them to because they don't [MN], I don't know, they don't really, um, you know, they want to avoid it if at all possible.  They want the median child, the one who's of median [MN] [COUGH] intellect and cooperation and so forth.  They really aren't geared to handle truly, like, really smart kids or children that are having learning --
R:  Mm.
L: -- disabilities.  So those are the children that usually get -- fall -- fall through the cracks.  Unless the parents have seen and forces the public school to do something.  If you're lucky enough to have a private -- to be able to send your child to private school you have a lot more influence and input --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- as to what they're reading.  
R:  Yeah.  And then again you got to be able to afford the private schools, you know.  It all depends on the parent's, uh, uh -- their income, you know.  Some people can't --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Some parents can't afford private schools.  They -- so they send their [MN] -- they -- they send their [MN] -- their kids to -- to public school. 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And, uh --
L:  What part of the country are you in?  On the east coast?
R:  I'm in, uh, New York.
L:  Uh.  I'm in southern California.
R:  You're in California?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're in the warm part.  It's not raining there though?
L:  It's -- it's warm today.  It's humid today.  It's kind of muggy which we aren't usually used to.  [MN]
R:  Oh.
L:  Kind of muggy.  It's been cloudy the rest of the weekend.  It's the first day it's been nice this weekend.  But I want to get my third call in.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.  They keep calling me and I keep not being able to take the call.  
R:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  
L:  Well, it's not over yet.  We still have to talk until they say we can stop talking.  
R:  Oh.
