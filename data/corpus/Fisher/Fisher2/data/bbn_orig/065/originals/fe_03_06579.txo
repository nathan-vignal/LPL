R:  Hi I'm Karen.
L:  Hi I'm Angie.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's pretty down there.
L:  Huh?
R:  It's pretty there.
L:  Oh, yeah it's beautiful.  Today was a good day actually.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  After all of the rain we got flooded out for a couple of days but today was a good one for a change.  [NOISE]
R:  Well that's good.  So where do you stand on this question?
L:  Actually it's really ironic because I'm divorced.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And yeah I have two small children and -- reason I divorced was infidelity but you know it wasn't acceptable to me.  For some it can we worked out but it was just, uh, the -- I don't know I think it's the ultimate betrayal and, um, I didn't hesitate to -- to leave after I found out and, um, I just think it was the moral thing to do.  Others have their own opinions but it doesn't matter it -- it wouldn't of made me happy to stay so I am glad that I left and --
R:  Yeah I -- I agree with you that I don't think -- if the marriage is bad and your parents don't get along I agree that it's not -- for the kids it's not the right thing for you to stay together, simply because my parents have been together and neither one of them was happy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My father never should of married he never wanted to get married --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- he resented every minute of it you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and they fought all the time and frankly it really effected -- me I've never married.
L:  Wow.
R:  My sister married but she's never had kids.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, she maintains a separate bank account.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness so you don't have any children?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  No I don't have any kids -- she does want have any kids either.
L:  Wow.
R:  But --
L:  It really affected you guys.
R:  Yeah -- yeah I think -- I really think it did because they were so unhappy and so [inaudible] rewarding institution.
L:  Hmm.  By example you know especially when you have to witness it for so many years.
R:  Well that's why I agree with you a lot of people it's easy for them to sit around and say, "Oh, but divorce is bad for kids" you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they do these studies and maybe they come out with studies of maybe studies that say well children of divorced don't do very well.  Well I don't -- how can you -- how can you have a test group?  How can you study children that stayed in a bad marriage -- don't -- do we.
L:  They -- they don't test -- they don't test you guys.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  They only test the ones that -- that come from the divorce and I -- I really believe if they -- if they did a study they would find that it's about is, um, I guess I would say it's about equal you know the success rate of the children of divorce and the success rate of children in unhappy marriages you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it effects the children and I wasn't really willing to make that sacrifice.  I think my children are happier you know they see him you know three times a week and we have joint custody but, um, you know and I have explained to them and they're really small like four and seven.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So you know I -- I do my best to explain to them --
R:  They know an amazing amount you know four and seven.  When you're not happy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they know that you know so I think that's good you know the fact that he is -- he is active in their lives.  He's a father -- that's wonderful you're very lucky in that respect.
L:  I think it's the guilt and it's still very fresh and I begin -- I just pray that it always stays the same you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I used to get annoyed that this was his fault and he feels like you know he's still responsible for being a part of their life which he is but I hope it doesn't grow old and you know someone else interferes with his views on his responsibility to the children so 
R:  Right.
L:  I'm hopeful.
R:  Yeah well is he also from the south?
L:  Yeah he's -- we -- we both we moved -- we're in Atlanta, we moved here from, um, from Florida.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Two years ago, um, we're entertainers and, um, I'm a writer actor and, um, he models and he acts but he has a full time gig and I only do the modeling, acting and writing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we moved here to pursue our -- our, you know, our careers and that way and, um, you know he got some work met new people and we're from a small horse town called [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And we came to the big city and so the temptation was overwhelming I guess he just wasn't strong enough to resist it and you know it forced the divorced so [NOISE] you know I just wasn't willing to sacrifice the whole life time of one happiness cause I've seen it happen over again and you know I've got a life to live, my children do as well and it's just you know I love myself more than I love him.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well that's good you should and you're teaching your kids a good lesson in that way, and that you know un- unfortunately a lot of -- I live in Los Angeles and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- a lot of people here seem to think that it's okay not to, um, get married in the first place and -- and then not to stay married and I think when you have kids that's something that you definitely need to look at.
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  And, um, you know there's a lot of families here in Los Angeles that have that don't have fathers.
L:  Right.
R:  You know and I -- I think it's very sad and they -- they don't -- they don't expect to that's the saddest part maybe this is a generational thing.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know maybe a lot of them haven't had fathers but --
L:  Yeah you're right you're right it -- it begins to be just a way of life and you know for the woman to bare the burden of -- of being the mother and the father to a child.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's a cycle that needs to be broken.
R:  And it becomes acceptable.
L:  Yep you're right you're absolutely right.  That's what I feel about the adultery you know it just becomes acceptable but I wasn't willing to you know -- I had to draw the line you know but so many of us just you know try to work through it and it's not always impossible sometimes it does turn out alright after -- afterwards but it takes a lot of work and dedication and I wasn't willing to give that much.
R:  Well and you know perhaps he wasn't either.
L:  No obviously no so.
R:  The only way you would of found out was you know to give it a try and you could of wasted valuable time.
L:  Yeah years -- years and years.
R:  So but I think it is sad I think um -- I think maybe divorce is too easy.  I think in the case of adultery that's certainly understandable but you read about these people that divorce in like three weeks and [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  They haven't given it much of a chance and they just decide they don't get along after all and -- and you know I -- I think it should be a more substantial reason.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah well we were married, um, seven years and, um, we dated two years before we married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it was almost you know ten years invested in the relationship and you know just when you think you know a person.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know just when you think you have got them down pack --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- here comes the surprise.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The quiet shy guy from the country turns into the gigolo for the city.
R:  Oh, god.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well at least you can laugh about it you have a good sense of humour.
L:  Oh, yeah we have a great relationship now and you know I'm -- I'm just so hopeful that it -- that it doesn't change -- I'm committed to making sure that we have the line of communication that we need so that the children don't suffer and we've been pretty good so far.
R:  Good -- good that's really good I'm happy for the girls too.
L:  Yeah so --
R:  That means a lot.
L:  Yeah the four your old is a boy --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and the seven year old is a girl so --
R:  Well maybe the boy will learn something from this too.
L:  Oh, definitely I'm working on that already had a [inaudible] he should be.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I guess --
R:  Well you do have to start young don't you.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Four is not too young.
R:  Well you know people out here too they also seem to think that school should be more active and like the school have any time or many left to teach morals --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- about values.
L:  I mean come on what responsibility will the parents have then?  None at all?  I mean --
R:  Well I think some sometimes they want to advocate [LAUGH] any responsibility.
L:  Wow.
R:  It seems they land in kind of two camps either they don't want any responsibility or they -- they interfere in every aspect of it.
L:  Yeah you're right there's very little room for middle ground I understand what you're saying those PTA parents kind of run the school in most cases.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In public schools.
R:  But anyway so -- so other than like from an outstanders[?] view I guess I'm not very -- very able to answer their question.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But I do think, um, --
L:  Well I think you are because I mean you were -- you were in a family that -- that did not decide to separate but it still has some -- you know some life you know -- I mean basically has altered your life in the way that you view marriage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I mean I think you do.
R:  Oh, definitely commitment is not a good thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Not when you're unhappy.
R:  Well you know and to stay forever to say always that's a big word I -- I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's always going to work for me I mean I figure if you're going to stand there and say forever then -- then that's what it should be you know and it's -- it's tough if things get bad you shouldn't stay together you should [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  You're right the vows should say --
R:  [inaudible] you know.
L:  We should change the vows I think that's it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  We should add things like if you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In the event that and [inaudible] very old mess about forever but that was so funny when you said the topic about [inaudible].
R:  So how old
