L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Yeah, interesting.
R:  My name is Esther.
L:  My name is Adrienne.
R:  Hello, Adrienne.
L:  Hi, Esther.
R:  Um, well, do you want to start, or --
L:  Well, th- --
R:  -- would you like me to?
L:  -- that's, that's an, that's an interesting, ah, topic, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because, [LAUGH] I'm a single person, and, um, I'm just thinking, uh, in -- in my family divorce wasn't much of an issue, except my brother has been, uh, divorced twice, and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um, I [MN] -- and we're not, uh, we're not in touch any longer so, it's -- it's a bit difficult, but I think it's made his life, uh, um, difficult particularly the last marriage, [MN] because that was a very good one, --
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- ah, what it did do for -- ah, to family values, I think, maybe the first one, where he moved far away, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, did impact on his, um, his boys, --
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, yeah, because, um, [MN] they're in their thirties, now, and neither one is married, --
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- right, mhm?
L:  -- but they have lots of girlfriends, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're not, you know, they're not weirdoes, they're not loners, they're not, you know, sometimes, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, there's other reasons, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're quite attractive and they're, um, but, uh, they're not married and their mother sure would like some grandchildren.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how about you?
R:  Well, I'm in my sixties and I do have the kids who are thirty, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I have been divorced and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of course, up until my generation I knew nobody that was divorced, I mean, --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- even if the parents were having problems, there just wasn't even discussion about it, you just, even if they were --
L:  That's right.  I'm in my sixties also.  So it just wasn't a factor.
R:  -- and, even if they were unhappy, and I don't think I really realized it until, I know, I became quite depressed by it, but I don't think I realized until my kids were in their twenties and thirties, the impact that it had on it.  I know that they -- [MN] you know, they had even been through therapy, and they were both -- I have three kids, one is not married, one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he does have some problems, but the other two, were afraid to get married, terribly afraid to get married.
L:  Well, when it -- when did the -- the divorce happen, when they were teenagers, --
R:  The d- the divorce happened when one was five and the other, other --
L:  Oh, oh, oh, --
R:  -- was twelve, and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's rough.
R:  -- and had a tremendous impact, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, in fact, they have both married, um, my daughter is thirty two, and she married a man who was divorced, she doesn't talk about it that much, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my son married, just got married, he's thirty eight, just got married, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he married a lovely g- girl --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whose parents were divorced, and, um, they even went to counselling, I mean, it just terrified them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be married and they all, you know, they lived together too, and the other kids lived together, too, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to find out what was happening, and I know, even at the weddings, [LAUGH] it was -- it was tough, because --
L:  Really?
R:  -- his wife has a mother and then she's got a stepmother, and then she's got all the grandparents and everybody, and none of the mothers were in the wedding, that was the only way to do it.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but it was okay, we were there, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and it wasn't anything, but I think it really has an impact and I know, I don't feel ousted fr- from my family, I do know that, um, --
L:  Do they see their father?
R:  Um, well, no, not really, you know, they -- they don't see their dad.  But --
L:  Really, by their choice or his choice?
R:  Well, he's a little strange, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, by their choice.  By their choice.
L:  Oh, okay, all right.
R:  But I do find it affects peop- -- the kids, because, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- even, I was in my forties, I had just turned forty and I think the fact that my friends became single people more so than married people with children, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, they didn't have, um, they didn't have that context of the -- of the full family, either.
L:  [MN] Well, yeah, --
R:  And I think they're doing --
L:  -- but your single friends, weren't some of them married and divorced?
R:  [SIGH] You know, it's strange?
L:  My friends are, you know, some are married and divorced.
R:  Strange enough, they're not. I've been working for, what, --
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  -- twenty five years, mostly working [LAUGH] with great people, adults who've -- I work for adults who have a psychiatric illness, so we're all, you know, in tune to the same thing, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but most of my friends are single, one's been divorced, and --
L:  Well, that's what I meant. 
R:  But with no kids at all.
L:  Your fr- -- some of your friends have been divorced.
R:  Yeah, well, but with no kids whatsoever.
L:  Oh, that's unusual, yeah.
R:  And I think as of now, I really do think, you know, I think they've adjusted, and I think it's hard --
L:  Your children, your children?
R:  Uh-huh, and I can tell you, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- never would have gotten married at twenty two if I had -- just hadn't thought it out.  I just wasn't ready?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  The kids get married today later and I think it's better.  Twenty two, I was nowhere ready to be married and have kids.  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  Well, they say that, but, um, -- they say that getting married is -- later i- is better, and, um, but the s- st- statistics --
R:  Statistics, right.
L:  -- don't show that at all, there's just as many divorces or more of them now.
R:  Right, and also living together doesn't really help either.
L:  Yeah, so, um, I'm not sure, I don't -- I know, it's probably because the times have changed and you just -- you know, if things don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- work out, you just go somewhere else.
R:  But I would have been more mature, --
L:  And --
R:  -- even in choosing a partner.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think I would have been more, --
L:  Well, I don't know, sounds like you're [MN] still beating yourself over the head about it, you know.  Yeah.
R:  Well, no, as I say, I've got wonderful friends, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think the kids, you know they're working on it, but -- but they really are --
L:  You think they're still working on it?  Gee.
R:  Um, I -- I do because they just got married, so that's why they're scared.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  That's the reason the thirty eight year old is scared, the other, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the younger one, I don't -- you know, think [MN] is -- is afraid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, you know, when having kids, too, I -- I don't know, -- well, they didn't, well, I was twenty four when I had -- you know, started having my kids.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  They want to have kids.  They do, and yet, there's a little bit of hesitancy.  And I --
L:  They're afraid it'll happen to them too, yeah.
R:  Right.  And I -- you know --
L:  My goodness, yeah.
R:  -- I -- but I don't think it's uncommon, I mean --
L:  Really?  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, in fact we've talked about it, and there's been a national program, adult children of divorced parents, and, -- on Oprah, -- and the kids listened and they were shocked. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Shocked, and so was I, to realize how we all fit in the same package.
L:  But that's over half of this population now, you know.
R:  That's true.
L:  And --
R:  But if you listen to the kids, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, it's probably like being an adult child of an alcoholic.
L:  Mm.
R:  It stays with them.
L:  Hm.
R:  And they're working, and they've got good jobs, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm real proud of them.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I really, really am proud of them, and I sure hope the institution of marriage, you know, continues, because, I think it's good, and I think the -- the --
L:  Well, I think that the kids now are getting more conservative, from what I've been reading, that there's a whole trend back to being more conservative, you know?  And --
R:  In what way are you saying that?
L:  Well, just, um, [MN] I hate that word family values, but that's exactly it.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, just, um, maybe, well, you know, because, um, generations always change, they do the opposite of what the one did before, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Or they -- at least say they're not going to be like their parents, but then [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, right, exactly, but we all are in some way, --
R:  They've got the same characteristics.
L:  We don't sometimes realize it till there's -- till they're gone, I mean, I realize how much I'm like my mother, it's unbelievable.
R:  That's what I say, [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  -- and a friend of mine who had a little contention with her mother, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is just the -- just the same way, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's, ah -- it's, ah, family, yeah.
R:  Right.  Well, I know that my son really keeps in touch and wants to keep in -- I have a twin sister, and lots of br- -- you know, three, ah, two brothers --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, my son really does keep in touch, because he's close to them.
L:  Yes.
R:  My daughter is involved in -- and her husband's from South Carolina.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm from Pittsburgh, so, they don't.
L:  Where are you from?  Where are you from?
R:  Pitt- -- from Pittsburgh.
L:  Are you in Pittsburgh? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, nice place.
R:  And originally Baltimore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the kids in -- in Massachusetts don't have that much family, but, we all get together in Reading, [LAUGH] halfway -- and one of my kids --
L:  Well, then, I mean, you -- you're lucky, 'cause I don't have any family at this point, they --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- after my parents died, they sued me and, um, I'm, I'm without, at this, you know, [MN] --
R:  W- well, that can be lonely.
L:  That -- that's very lonely --
R:  I have my --
L:  -- at this point in my life.  You know.
R:  I have my books, and my cat, which is -- I love --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my cat and working, so, I -- I do feel fortunate.
L:  What do you, oh, you work too, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm still working part time. 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Okay, that's --
R:  I'm --
L:  -- good, yeah.
R:  I'm still working part time.
L:  I do charity work, and some other, you know, local things, but, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]
R:  But we try to get together, um, Erica's in Reading, which is about six hours from Boston and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Pittsburgh so, we try to get together there, you know, at least twice a year.
L:  Well, you, you're lucky.  You do have family values, you're, you know, --
R:  Ah, --
L:  -- you and your kids get along, so, I mean, that's wonderful.
R:  Right. 
L:  Not everybody does and you know that! [LAUGH]
R:  That I know.
L:  Yeah, they're always -- ah, I can think of some myself.  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's terrific. [MN]
R:  So, um, I guess I'd say, I'm -- I'm doing okay, I -- I, really, you know, --
L:  Yeah, it sounds like you are, I mean, and you have the support of family, and --
R:  I do, but there's more support in my --
L:  It's very important.
R:  -- in friends.  Much more support in my friends, 'cause kids are young, and I know, even at that age, --
L:  Yeah, they -- they got other things to do, yeah.
R:  Well, they're thinking about their family, and their kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, just get- -- as I say, just getting married, and their jobs --
L:  Well, you think of yourself.  When I was younger, I'm thinking now, I said, you know, yeah, I was, I was, my mother said to me she -- before she died, she was, oh, um, -- I didn't know why she meant that, she said something about, "Oh, well, you were in Paris", you know.
R:  Ah.
L:  I said, "Oh, oh, --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- gee, I thought you wanted me to, you know, travel the world".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I know, I --
L:  [LAUGH] she sent me to a good school, and all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that stuff, but when it came right down to it, you know, I guess I was in Paris, or somewhere, yeah.
R:  Well, I know there was so much that I wanted to say to my mother which was unsaid.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  Because she was in her sixt- -- she was sixty one when she died, --
L:  Oh, gee, that's too early, yeah.
R:  -- and I didn't realize it till so much later, "Oh, my God, I should have said this and I should have --
L:  Yeah, shouldn't we have all said --
R:  And I should have" -- not the should, I'm sorry, I wasn't there. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you don't realize it till you get to her point in life.
L:  That's right.
R:  And especially if you're single or alone, you realize, "Oh, my God, she had to go through that alone, as well".
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  I hope we can learn, you know.
L:  Well, we learn, but
