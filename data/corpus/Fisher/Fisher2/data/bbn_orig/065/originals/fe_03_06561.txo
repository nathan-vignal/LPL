R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my name is Tammy.
L:  What is your name?
R:  Tammy.  
L:  Tammy, hi, I'm Renee.
R:  Hi, Renee.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm, ah, from Michigan.
R:  Okay.  I'm calling from California.
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  [MN]
L:  Is it warm out there?
R:  Um, yeah, it's a little cooler than usual.  It's actually, like, in the sixties right now.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's what it is here too.
R:  Sixty eight, I think, is gonna be the high today, which is really unusual, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I've only been out here for, like, three weeks, and it's been -- it's been pretty cool most of the time --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- in the sixties and seventies.  Yeah, there was a warm day when it got up into the m- -- mid nineties or something, but that was it --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so it's really been weird, yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm not -- I don't know if I got everything that the computer said --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- about the topic today.  Did you?
L:  Ye- -- about, is it chang- -- has the divorce rate changed your values, or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- changed the way you act.
R:  Mm.
L:  So --
R:  And the divorce rate, hm. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have y- -- have you been affected by divorce?
L:  Um, no, I haven't [SIGH], um, I've been married --
R:  Neither have I.
L:  -- for -- I've been married for almost thirteen years now, and have two kids, and, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Really?  What about your parents?
L:  Uh, yes, my parents are divorced.
R:  Okay.
L:  And my grandparents.
R:  Mm, okay.
L:  So, um [LIPSMACK], I -- I guess in some cases I think it is a good thing.  I think it's unfortunate, um, but --
R:  What do you mean, you think it was a good thing?
L:  Well, I'm -- I mean, my parents sh- -- were married for twenty nine years, and I think they should have got divorced long before they ever did.
R:  Really?  How come?
L:  Um, well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- by the time [LIPSMACK] I was four years old and my brother was born, they had already started counselling.  And, you know, it was just a matter of staying together for the kids.  They seem to be much, much happier now, so I'm glad for that [MN].
R:  Your grandparents or your parents you're talking about?
L:  No, this -- that's my parents.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ... 
R:  So, how did you feel that they were -- that they stayed together for the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kids, as you say?
L:  Well, [MN] I don't think it was good.  I mean, my mom left a couple of times and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- tried to, and he always begged her to come back and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so, I mean --
R:  Did it affect you, you think?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think the way I grew up with their arguing and their fighting and the drinking and -- yeah --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I think that definitely did affect me.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I got married I didn't think marriage was gonna be hard and it was a lot harder than I ever thought [LAUGH].
R:  Really?  What makes it so hard, I wonder?
L:  [MN] Well --
R:  'Cause I'm not married.
L:  -- well, I just -- it -- my husband, um, he did come [LIPSMACK] -- um, [inaudible], um, [NOISE] he was married before --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and she left with his best friend [SIGH], and --
R:  She what?
L:  -- left with his best friend.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  How horrible.
L:  And I think that -- I think he brought a lot of baggage to the marriage with that, and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- me with the screaming and fighting and the drinking all the time, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- I think that was real hard to overcome.  
R:  Really?
L:  Um, but, you know -- I mean, time and patience --
R:  Did you go through counselling?
L:  Actually, we did.  Um [LIPSMACK], right before our first anniversary, and for maybe about a year, year and a half.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was the best thing we ever did [SIGH].
R:  Really?  
L:  Oh, yes.  Most --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- definitely.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he is truly [SIGH] my best friend, and we were best friends before we got marriage --
R:  Really?
L:  -- er, before we got married, and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in fact we almost didn't date because we were such good friends that we didn't want to --
R:  Really? 
L:  -- lose our friendship --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- if it didn't work out.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, um, I think -- I think sometimes people just take divorce as the easy way out though, and I don't think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't think --
R:  You know, and that's what I -- I mean, I can't really talk, it -- it's kinda difficult for me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to talk about, because [LIPSMACK] -- hey, by the way are you hearing me okay?
L:  Oh, yeah, you're fine, yeah.
R:  Okay, good.  Um, I'm on the cellphone.  It doesn't always have the best reception, but --
L:  Oh, no, it's fine.
R:  [COUGH] Oh, okay.  Um, it's a little difficult for me to talk about, because my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- parents have never been divorced, and I'm not married, so, um [LIPSMACK] -- so I guess I kinda look at the whole situation in, like, um -- I don't know -- a [MN] pristine kind -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kind of way, like, well it shouldn't -- it shouldn't happen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, the bible says you should not get divorced, um, but it -- and I'm a big believer in Christ an- -- and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- all of that, you know.  So, um --
L:  Well, and see, that was --
R:  -- I kinda look at it that way, but it's hard for me because I've never personally experienced it myself.  
L:  Yeah, and -- see with my husband, I mean, she committed adultery, even though he didn't wanna get divorced.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and then once he came around, realized, you know, um, you know [LIPSMACK], this was [SIGH] the best thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh -- but he had said, "I will never get married ever again".  I remember --
R:  Really?
L:  -- his best -- his best friend telling me that, like two days before the -- the wedding, you know?  He's like --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- "I can't believe he's doing this, he said he would never do this again" and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I said, "Well, I --"
R:  You must have had some sort of effect on him.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, and --
R:  That's great.
L:  -- we have so much fun together and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, two wonderful children, and, um --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so, you know, it's -- it's a great thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [MN] Well, I -- my ex boyfriend recently, like, came back into my life, or started calling again, and I'm just like, you know, an- -- and I mean I was totally in love with him, and, um, I know that he is -- he is really in love with me, and, um, I know that if I were to marry him, that'd be it.  In --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in my eyes, you know?  I mean, the thought of divorce just -- I mean, it -- it doesn't even enter my mind as a possibility --
L:  Oh, I know. [NOISE]
R:  -- once I get married, you know?  But I mean, I know it -- like, I believe what the bible says --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there are two reasons, basically, I think, that you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that divorce is okay.  And that's, you know, physical abuse number one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and number two, um, adultery --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, [MN] I mean, I want -- if those two things --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- were to enter my life, um, were to happen in my marriage, I don't know how I would react, you know?  I'm pretty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- strong and independent, I'd probably be willing to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to divorce, but, at this point in my life, it's like [MN] that sh- -- that should not even be something that enters my mind.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And I think that the world is completely different now from when I was growing up, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty nine.
L:  Okay, I'm thirty five.
R:  And -- okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I know when I -- when I was -- when I was younger, you know, in school, I went to a Christian school, so maybe the divorce rate was a little less, but, um, you hardly ever heard of parents getting divorced and -- and -- and when they were being [MN] -- when they were getting divorced, it was like, um, you know, kinda hush hush, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  -- kinda embarrassing to talk about or whatever.  But now I -- it's hard to find anybody whose parents have not been divorced, or who have --
L:  I know.
R:  -- not been divorced themselves, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  
R:  I think the world has totally changed in that regard. [NOISE]
L:  It -- it has, and I'm just hoping that I [SIGH] instill those values in my children --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Me too.
L:  And -- on the way that I feel, and, you know, y- -- you gotta be sure before you step into it --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- and it's not something you step into lightly.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, and hopefully --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there will be [LAUGH] enough people out there that feel the same way as my child, you know, one day, eventually, when I have a child --
L:  Right.
R:  -- one day, you know?  That, th- -- a- a- an- -- and I hope that I'm able to teach my child and my children, um [LIPSMACK], that you -- you don't do it, so that -- a- a- and I hope I can teach them actually, um, [LAUGH] -- I'm sorry, losing my train of thought -- that you don't do it, but also, that you, um, ah [LIPSMACK], what was I gonna say?  That, oh, that they know how to find somebody else who feels the same way that they do, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, and I --
R:  That's the big thing.
L:  And I do feel too that a good Christian background is -- [SIGH] I mean, that can help you through a lot of things --
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  -- so ...
R:  I mean, and -- and I know that that's why [NOISE] has not experienced that, is because of my Christian background.  You know, I mean, I have four other brothers and sisters, plus my parents, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and none of them, I mean, none of them, there's no divorce with any of them, and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- a- an- and I think the only person I know of, in my, um, extended family, is my Aunt Louise, who was divorced --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but that's like one out of how many, you know?
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], and so I know that it's because, you know, my whole family has just been big believers, you know, and I know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I know that that has had that effect, and so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's what I wanna instill in my children one day, hopefully so that their world is not turned upside down by divorce --
L:  Right.
R:  -- eventually.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I'll come back to that, honey.  We -- we're painting fingernails, just while I'm talking here.
R:  Oh, cool [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] My daughter.  Okay, I --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- I have to ask you, how did you find out about this study?
R:  Um, there's a, um, I don't know, like a -- an industry magazine here called LA Weekly --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, and, um, there was an ad in it --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, how -- what about you?
L:  Well, I've -- get on, um, a website called Refunding Makes Cents [LIPSMACK] and --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and I've -- and I've heard so many people talking about this -- this study and that, and that they've actually talked to other people that get on the same website, so that's why I had to ask if [LAUGH] that's where --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you found it or not, so ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, this -- I think it's really cool, and I mean, you get thirty bucks to talk about topics, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  All right [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's something.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But -- and -- and I'm a big talker anyway, I love to talk, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I do too, yeah.  
R:  So, this is perfect [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's perfect for me, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I guess -- I guess with my grandparents, you know, that was a ca- -- um, adultery too, and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- then with my parents --
