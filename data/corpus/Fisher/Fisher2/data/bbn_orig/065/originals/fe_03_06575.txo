R:  Hello? 
L:  Hi. 
R:  Hi I'm Barbara from New Jersey.
L:  Oh, hi, um, I'm Betty and I'm in South Carolina right now.
R:  Hi Betty how are you? 
L:  I'm fine how are you? 
R:  Okay.  Our topic of the day is, um, how the --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- how the divorce -- if -- if we feel that the divorce rate has, um, --
L:  Effected us.
R:  Absolutely, um, I'm a mum of, uh, two sons.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And I've been divorced twice.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Married and divorced twice.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Um, my, um, children are fifteen and eighteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And divorce has definitely effected --
L:  Well yeah.
R:  -- my life yeah absolutely.
L:  Mhm.  It's effected it negatively or --
R:  Well --
L:  -- positively or what? 
R:  Oh, definitely negatively.
L:  Really it -- it effected me very positively.
R:  Positively.
L:  Yes I'm divorced as well.
R:  Oh.
L:  Best day of my life.
R:  Um, it's, uh, -- how long were you married? 
L:  Mhm, I don't even know something like eighteen years.  A long time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe longer.  I really didn't keep up with -- we were separated for quite a while and, um, we just kind of fell into the divorce part I actually thought we were getting a divorce when we went to court and we changed it so many times it was just a separation agreement.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And so my ex-husband said, "What do you want to get a divorce?" and I said, "Yes" and so, um, I sign the papers while the judge got ready to know to lunch.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  It was great because you know we'd been wrestling with it so for so long whether to do it or whether to get separated or what to do and just to have it over with was just wonderful.
R:  I was, um, married the first time for thirteen years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's the father of my children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the second time for six years.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And, um, --
L:  Oh, that's a long time too.
R:  Yeah it definitely wasn't in my plan -- my grand plan of, um, -- of life but, um, things happen. 
L:  It actually was in mine.  When I got married I said I was going to stay married till I was thirty nine.
R:  Really? 
L:  You know then I was going to do something else, but I never thought about it again.  But it's what happened isn't that weird. 
R:  Mhm.  You know and -- and, uh, my idea was -- my ideal would have been to, um, get married and stay married forever that was you know my plan to do.
L:  I could want stand that.
R:  What's that? 
L:  I couldn't stand it.  That would just -- think about it.  If you had to do the same thing for your whole life and you've only got one life.  It's a horrible thought.
R:  But why get married anyway if that's the case.
L:  Well because that's, um, that's just part of the life cycle.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  You need to have children and you need to be married to have children and that's what I believe.
R:  Well that would.  I -- I --
L:  I had five.
R:  Five kids Oh, my god.  I do think you ought to be married to have kids --
L:  And I did.
R:  -- essentially --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, I think that the you know I think it hurts them deeply especially -- I was -- my parents got divorced when I was four years old.
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  And my dad was an alcoholic so I had a lot to deal within that respect but um 
L:  Well my husband was too.
R:  Yeah it sucks.
L:  So for us it was the biggest release in the world for the whole family we were so happy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know everybody's different.  The situation's different.
R:  Right -- right.
L:  But no I couldn't of done that forever I needed to be free to do what I wanted to do and 
R:  Do you walk outside the home? 
L:  I, um, -- actually I work for Outward Bound.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know what that is? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah I was, um, Director of development for Outward Bound.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I bought a travel agency with a bunch of Australians -- I spent a lot of time in Australia.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And, um, that was in Denver and I had that for a long time -- well not a long time five years -- I was on a five year plan and then I got together with my high school sweetheart and moved back to North Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Which is not a good place to be.
R:  Which town in North Carolina?
L:  Well right now it's outside of Charlotte but we were in Wilmington, we were living on the beach.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which I think everybody should live on the beach once in their lives.
R:  I live about ten minutes from the beach.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a -- pretty nice.
L:  It is.  Well we were right there but then we were evacuated so many times.
R:  With the storms and everything? 
L:  Uh-huh.  We had a lot of hurricanes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So finally I sold it in October but that was actually sort of a marriage too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I don't want to do that forever either.
R:  Are you -- are you with this man now? 
L:  Some yeah -- sort of.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well [COUGH] not right this second, he's at his sisters right now but yeah.
R:  But you're still together.
L:  Yeah -- yeah but you know it's nice not to be all of time.
R:  Oh, yeah I think -- I think you know everybody needs their -- needs their, uh, own freedom and, um, --
L:  Well I've never been able to -- I did facilitating for beyond divorce for a long time which is, um, -- it was in Denver and I have never found anybody that I would want to swap places with.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Anybody it's just so confining.
R:  Well I think it depends upon you know what kind of marriage you have.
L:  I don't know, I've seen lots of marriages and I was working in a -- as a travel consultant in Wilmington as well and lots of people all retired came in so they would all be older than I am or my age.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And I didn't see one that -- that I thought that I would want.
R:  As a -- as a, uh, partner? 
L:  Well no as a marriage.
R:  As a marriage.
L:  Mhm.  On either side and I know some people get really comfortable with it, but I don't know.
R:  You know sometimes I wonder if, um, -- you know if I made the vowel twice to get married and stay married you know the first time was, um, we just grew apart.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  He was a -- he was not a communicator at all.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And, um, I am and we just you know we just grew apart as the years went by sixteen years with him and second time I found him cheating on me with many different women so that was just devastating.
L:  It is horrible you shouldn't ever trust anybody again.
R:  Well I'm with someone now who I do trust.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And he is, um, you know we've been together for almost three years.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And you know he gives me good reason to -- to believe and to trust again.
L:  How old is he? 
R:  He's forty seven.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And I'm forty four although sometimes I can wring his neck.
L:  [LAUGH] You're right there.
R:  Yeah he's in the next room making a cup of coffee for me.
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yeah so.
L:  Yeah well I think, um, actually I really very strongly believe people should stay together when they have little children.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Cause I'm living in a community right now to be close to my daughter and she has a friend who's separated [inaudible] with four children.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Cause children.  I think they need the stability even if -- I mean if it's not really horrible -- mine got so horrible I had to split up but as long as it's not really awful and not taking all of your time to deal with.
R:  Well you know what happens -- I mean I am a registered nurse --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, you know what happens but for the grace of god and for my education I mean I'd be -- I'd be, uh, you know working at -- working at Kmart.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Making minimum wage if, um, --
L:  Well yeah.
R:  If I didn't have my education and --
L:  Part of that's true.
R:  And, um, you know what do people do? 
L:  Well I don't know.  I was lucky because I had a really good job and I did say once I get a job that I can support us and that's it and that's what I did.  I went -- I was thirty nine I decided okay I have to go full time, I can't do anything else if I'm going to get a divorce and --
R:  You have to and I know it's changed, it's definitely change the relationship between my sons and me.  I mean even though my -- my little one was, um, four when we separated.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my older one was seven it was, uh, it was hard -- very difficult for me but I -- you know as you said before it was once --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, I couldn't -- I couldn't bear to just keep on going in this marriage even after -- after going through marriage counselling and doing all of those kinds of things.
L:  We did that and the counselor told me, "If you -- he does not want to change if you decide you want to get a divorce come back and I'll help you".
R:  Come back and he'll --
L:  And he would help me deal with getting a divorce the counselor said.  No it's okay.
R:  Come back on what?
L:  Come back.
R:  Oh, come back.
L:  Yeah go back to him and then I heard later he got a diverse.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He had four children too but --
R:  Well you had -- there was alcohol involved with that. 
L:  With mine? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah but that wasn't the problem it was just a -- he's like that.  I think alcohol only [inaudible] or you know the problem.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  The person who's an alcoholic just acts like they are but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Without any control like getting old you just get more the same.
R:  Well it's, uh, -- it's an addictive -- you know it's an addictive behaviour it's a disease.
L:  Mhm.  Well yeah but John was a jerk no matter whether --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he drank or not.
R:  Right -- right.
L:  So you couldn't blame that he actually created the disease anyway.
