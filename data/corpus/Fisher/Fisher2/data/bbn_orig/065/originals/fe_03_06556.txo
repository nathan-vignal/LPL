R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Uh, my name is Ann, and I live in Memphis, Tennessee.  Where do you live?
L:  Yes, my name is Rhonda, and I live in Little Rock, Arkansas.
R:  Um, I'm not so sure I have anything very profound to say on this topic.  This is only my second phone call.  Have you done this before?
L:  This is my third one [LAUGH].
R:  Third one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's all you're allowed, isn't it true?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh, there's three.
R:  Well, I started to hang up, 'cause I thought it -- it's not a topic that I'm real serious about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I was sitting here reflecting while I was waiting.  Um, I suppose that I am for mandatory drug testing.  Um, as a non drug user, um, it's not an invasion of my privacy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I don't feel like any position, well -- which would be almost any position if you were on drugs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there could be harm done to other people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh, so [MN] I think -- most companies -- I worked for a company that did mandatory drug testing.  And they gave you plenty of opportunity; they didn't just fire you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if you had one bad drug test.
L:  Right.
R:  Th- they -- they gave you opportunity to -- to go into counselling and numerous other things, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I believe any company has a right to set almost any standard they want to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, to hire you.  That's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, that's -- that's up to me as to whether or not want -- I want to accept that stipulation when -- when I sign on to go to work for someone.
L:  Right, that's right.  You know and -- you know, I -- I believe also, you know, I'm saying this because [SIGH] you're coming to work for that particular company --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you have to -- have to abide by their rules and regulations --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- you know?  Uh, you're on their time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for the time that you're there, you know, you clock in [SIGH], and, you know, if they have a rule of, you know, uh, mandatory, uh, drug testings or whatever, you know, of course, um, you know this, you know you should comply with that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [SIGH] I myself, I'm a, you know, non drug user as well, so it doesn't -- it doesn't -- doesn't bother me at all, you know.  I'm like, "Well, hey, great" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?
R:  Well, you know, also, what you have to remember i- is they're talking about illegal drugs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, for starters, y- you've got a criminal on your premises if you look at it in that way.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  And then also it's a known fact that many drug users are not -- I don't say all of them.  I suppose there are people that use it recreationally, but I -- I think it's difficult to do that long term, so I'm -- I'm kinda anti drug --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but as long as it's illegal it's the same as saying, "Well, you can't steal on our premises, or you can't --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- break any law".
L:  Right, right.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I don't -- I -- to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- only drug users would violently oppose this.
L:  Will oppose it, right.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Because they are indulging in the --
R:  [LAUGH] Right, exactly [LAUGH].
L:   [LAUGH] They're like, "Well, hey man, I'm against that --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- drug testing thing 'cause, look, I'm doing so much drugs that I know I'd get --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- terminated or whatever --" [inaudible].
R:  Well, you also have to remember that it carries over.  Their -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their thing would be, well, it's not their business what I do on my own time.  But it is if the effects of it carry over into your work time.
L:  Into your work.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's right, yeah, 'cause it can, you know, it could be devastating --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, i- i- -- I'm sure a lot of, um, you know, jobs have had that happen, you know.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And that's --
R:  Sure they have.
L:  -- that's the wh- -- that's the reason they have these drug, you know, mandatory drug testings and --
R:  We have one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- right here in Memphis.  Um, a school bus driver, several years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, had an accident and killed quite a few children, I think about five children --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, it came out later.  I think he had a small amount of marijuana --
L:  Gosh.
R:  -- and that may or may not have been the cause of the bu- -- [SIGH] this school bus --
L:  Right.
R:  -- accident.  But it -- you know, as a pa- -- if you were a parent of a school age child --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you would certainly be for mandatory --
L:  Right.  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- drug testing for that reason that, [SIGH] you don't want anybody under the influence of anything, really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even, maybe, prescription medication that made them drowsy, or something --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- like that.  So, I just think an employer has a right to call the shots and they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they have a right to say, "When you work on these premises, you have to obey all the state and federal laws as well --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- as our requirements".  
L:  Right, oh yeah [inaudible] --
R:  So, um, I just, you know, I would have to say I'm for it, if I -- if I was voting on it, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, look, they'd sure -- sure they have my vote too, because, you know, b- because of the -- the drug problem that we have in this country, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I mean, it's really just gotten outta -- I mean, just out of hand.  And -- and, you know, they got to do something, you know.
R:  Mhm, I know.  They can't let people keep dying.  And -- and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I feel the same way --
L:  Right.
R:  -- about alcohol, when people drive --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I almost wish there was some kind of mandatory [SIGH] -- well, it couldn't be a mandatory test, but I wish they had some kind of gizmo in your car where, if you were too drunk to drive [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it wouldn't -- 
L:  The car wouldn't start [LAUGH].
R:  -- let you turn the key on [LAUGH].
L:  Now, you know, that's a good idea.  That -- some- somebody might come up with that now [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, when you see the number of alcohol related --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- deaths, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whether you're for or against alcohol, I can't imagine anybody saying, "Well, I'm for driving drunk" --
L:  I know.
R:  -- because that's putting their life on the line, too [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.  It is.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, do you have young children?
L:  Um, I have a son.  Uh, he's fourt- --
R:  Uh-huh.  How old is he?
L:  -- fourteen.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, dear.  He's in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's in that age where [SIGH] he may try experimenting with drugs [inaudible] --
L:  I pray to God, I hope that he doesn't, you know, but, you know, like I say --
R:  Well, he probably won't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Odds are with you that he won't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think that you would certainly be for any type of drug testing --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- to make sure that he's not tempted [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] Oh, of- of- of course I -- I would, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and, um, like I say, you know, this has gotten out of hand.  And, you know, with the children and the -- the teenagers and, you know, it's just -- I mean, some of 'em are starting out at -- at very young -- young ages in some places.
R:  I can't understand that, because it seems to me like parents would be keeping up with them at a younger age --
L:  I know.
R:  -- [inaudible] adolescents, but, uh --
L:  Yes, I know. 
R:  -- I guess we're supposed to stick to the topic here.  I ca- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't really know [SIGH] anything else to say about mandatory drug testing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- except I'm all for it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- es- especially in any kinda situation where you need to be alert.  Which is most any job, let's face it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, who wants somebody half stoned --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um, you know, if -- if they're using it even recreationally, it's -- it's going to -- to affect --
L:  It's going to affect them on the job.
R:  -- their job performance, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] I'm -- like I said, I almost, when she told me the topic, I thought, "Oh, me --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- there's not much to say, except I'm for it", you know [LAUGH]?
L:  I'm for it, yeah, yeah.  And, you know, an- and -- and, you know, and I'm sure 'cause [inaudible] I have the same opinion, I'm for it and -- and, um, the drug testing and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, anything else they can do, you know, to -- to -- to, um, [LIPSMACK] help, you know, stop, well -- I know they won't be able to stop it all completely, but, you know, that help deter it somewhat, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Where it -- keep a lot of, um, you know, things happening --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that maybe wo- wouldn't happen if it wouldn't be drug related, you know.
R:  Well, it also might be an incentive for a young person [SIGH] just starting a career --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to understand that even recreational drugs, that they think don't affect their job performance --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they have to realize that that's the standards if -- if -- in other words, I think we ought to throw as many road blocks as we can at 'em to make 'em think about what they're doing.
L:  Right, exactly.  
R:  And it's -- it's pretty common among [SIGH], say the -- the late teens and early twenties, and they -- they don't foresee on down the road the hazards of being a +drug -- drug addict.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  And I -- I'm sure that all of 'em don't become out and out addicts, but I would say --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the chances are pretty good --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if they start that young.
L:  Yes, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, you know, it might help nip some of those in the bud --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if the employer went to them and said, "Look, you know [SIGH], you're gonna have another drug testing and you just can't work here under those conditions", so, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- may- maybe more and more companies -- I don't know what percentage of companies now have that, 'cause I'm not out there in the [SIGH] workforce.  But I wo- -- I would say a fair number, and most of 'em tell you on the front end.  I've seen ads in the paper that say mandatory drug testing --
L:  Oh, right, yes.  I have too, you know, an -- an -- and, you know, and that, you know, I believe too that would -- like you say, you wouldn't be able to save all, but it would help save some.
R:  Mhm.  Might scare some of 'em --
L:  You know.
R:  -- in the right direction --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they want, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a certain type job, so, um --
L:  Right, and help make 'em think twice about that and what they're doing.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Well, we're -- we're in full agreement, so we didn't really --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- find anything to debate about, did we [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH] No, no, no debate here.  Wh- -- when it comes to that [LAUGH] drug testing, I'm all for it.
R:  Now, if I'd gotten a young twenty year old, I might, um --
L:  You might of had a little battle there, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] He -- he might put up some arguments and I'd have to [SIGH] give a counter argument to it --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, so ...  But, uh --
