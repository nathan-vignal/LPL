R:  Hi, it's Clare.
L:  Hey, Trayna.
R:  Hi, Trayna.  How ya doing?
L:  Fine.  How are you doing?
R:  I'm okay.
L:  S- -- what is the topic?
R:  Um ... should high crime trials be televised?
L:  Oh, I don't have no problem with them being televised.
R:  Right.  I think they should be televised too.  I think the whole world should see, you know, what's going on but then they always say, uh, you know, that a person won't get a fair trial and all this and -- and they push for change of venue and ... and I think, you know, and sometime the people, you know, like the criminal lawyers or the psychologist or, you know, people that's, you know, forensics, whatever?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, uh, you know, I -- I don't think it should just be ... limited to that, you know, group of people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  I mean, I m- a polygraph would probably just cut all that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- short but [SIGH] you know, they always disputing everything.  They dispute a polygraph, they'll dispute forensics, they'll dispute DNA.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, you know, it's like a cat and mouse game about should it be televised, should it not be, you know?  And -- and people really think that, like, it's okay, you know?  Maybe we can get away with murder, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  If that be the case.  It can be rape, murder, kidnap or whatever and yeah, I think it should be televised because I -- I think if the person -- you know, it's like flushing a rat out of a hole, you know?  I- if a person could stay hidden and commit crimes then, I mean, they keep doing it and doing it and doing it, they should have -- you know, they should be looked at, like, under a microscope eye- or eyes but everybody should see what they did, you know?  Because everything you do in dark will come to light.
L:  That's true.  Well, I think that, um ... once they picked the jurors that they pick enough jurors and then they pick some alternates, then they can put it on TV.  I would keep it under wraps until they pick everybody, then once you get everybody you quarantine al- alternates and the jurors so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you won't have any problems with it being, um, getting a unfair trial or whatever.  Cause I -- have you ever watched one?
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  Did -- which did you watch?  You watch 'em all the time or --
R:  The -- well, the -- the, um, most recent one I watched was the, um, Scott Peterson one.
L:  Is that the Lacy, um --
R:  Yeah.  Lacy Pearson or was it Pearson --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or Peterson?  Pearson.  Peterson [inaudible]?
L:  I think it was Patterson.  I don't know.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Something like that though.
R:  Well, Lacy and Scott Pete.  Put it like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, well, yeah, she was pregnant and he's supposed to have killed her and, uh, didn't.  Somebody said she was part of a cult because they decapitated her head and they took some of her organs.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then he changed his -- color of his hear and people was wondering where was he going?  Was he planning to leave the country or what so yeah, I think it all -- and also I -- and, uh, in the past was that -- like I said, was the most recent one and also in the past I've wor- -- I watched, uh, Dr. Kevorkian case.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, um ... the Clyde Barrows case where, uh, the husband's supposed to have killed the wife and the kids and it's like [inaudible] and then I watched the +Menendez brothers; two twin boys that was charged with killing their parents?  Menendez brothers?
L:  Uh --
R:  Remember that?
L:  Yeah, I remember them. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just never watched 'em.  I think I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- read about 'em more than --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- watched 'em.
R:  Yeah, so ... you know, and all kinds of stuff it's on the same, uh, you know, Unabomber.  I mean, you know, Oklahoma city bombing, you know, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  There was a one guy on there, um, I forgot what his name was.  Rolrico[?].  I know his name was Rico something and he was charged with killing his girlfriend and I think four -- had little children.  And there was -- you know, he stabbed 'em all to death and there was blood on the walls and the floor and -- and everything and it showed how he had ... when he reenacted the crime in court --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it showed that ... he had -- both the kids was running and he had been going -- running through the house chasing and stabbing 'em all.  How he had, uh, numerous times run through their blood.
L:  Oh.
R:  And there was footprints all over there with blood on.  The kids was jumping on the table, jumping on the couch, you know, howling and screaming trying to get away and they're -- blood, uh, footprints on the -- on the table and the carpet, you know, where he was chasing the kids all through the house and when he --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- was on trial he was like a animal.  You know, he was a black guy and he was like, I think it's about, like there was about five ... maybe five foot four, about a hundred and thirty pounds and you could see just looking at him that he was like going through like mentally -- you know, a mental psychosis.  Like, he was like really crazy.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know?  And um, and he was getting angry with the judge and the prosecutors and stuff and they was referring to him as boy and, you know, he wasn't -- call him by his name and he was like, "Don't address me as this and that.  My name is such and such" and they kept, you know, referring to him as the defendant, the suspect.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you know, saying the crime was heinous and what kind of animal could do this and he was, you know -- he was like, "I'm not a animal" and he could like make an outburst.
L:  Well, they was provoking him.  You might be able to do that.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, he c- murdered five people and he sat up there getting smart, sassy at the mouth --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- with somebody.  He to- -- he killed five people.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, he was up there on -- you know, on TV like, sh- -- like, you know, like what?  It was like real crazy so yeah, I think -- y- yeah, I think it should be televised definitely.  Even though same thing with like, um, [LIPSMACK] serial rapists or these, um, child predators.  You know how they have to have their name on the register and -- and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, if a sex offender move in your neighborhood you're supposed to know about it?  Yeah, I think yeah, I think it should be televised and exposed and -- and every -- every -- every degree.  Every inch of fiber, every -- every -- every breath we take.
L:  Well, what about some of 'em that have changed and like ... it's just like with the child predator things or whatever --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the child molester.  Sometimes, you know, it's not right but the situation ain't what it seems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they're being punished and it's gonna follow you the rest of your life because like I knew someone who had a sign on their door --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he couldn't find a job.  People would ride by his house, you know, and he had kids and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he had t- -- I know, like, one guy he had to stand, like, in a yard or something with a sign that said, "I molested someone or --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- statutory rape".  That's not right.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Why it's not right?
L:  It is -- I -- you can't -- has -- I mean, that person had kids.  What about his family?
R:  What person had kids?  The people --
L:  The guy that had -- one of the -- guy that had to spend in the, um --
R:  The suspect had kids or the victim.
L:  The suspect had kids.
R:  Oh, well, then he should of known better than to go out and do that to somebody else's kids.  [inaudible] doing that to his kids.
L:  I guess.  I don't know.  That would be --
R:  Well, it's good for the goose, it's good for the gander.  That's the American way.
L:  I guess.
R:  No?
L:  Well, I mean, w- we've got little kids th- -- well, my daddy's sitting in the yard with a big sign.  He went to jail.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, those kids are gonna have problems.  They're gonna get picked on every day and everything.
R:  Okay, so what about the -- the victims family whose kids got raped and murdered by this guy?
L:  That's true.  I mean, they need help too but you -- I just -- it's for the -- the statutory rape thing, you know?  Murder's something different but I don't know, having someone stand on a site -- stand on a street with a sign.
R:  Oh, well.  Eh ...
L:  What do you think you learn in paying from cart -- court cases like the um --
R:  Did I learn anything from court cases on Court TV?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I learned a lot.  I learned that the animals stand up in the court being accused of heinous crimes, yeah, should be -- yeah, should be exposed.
L:  What about the forensics and stuff?  Did you realize how much they did and all that or --
R:  Yeah, forensics did -- it was the kids blood all over the place.  The kids' blood was all over the place.  He had blood all over him.  He has footprints in the blood where he was running through the house, through the bloody house chasing the kids.
L:  Mm.  Did you see how you can't wash the blood away with the lamp?  That the blood'll still show up with a special lamp?
R:  Yeah, but he killed -- just with his demeanor in court.  Just being under the -- under fire in court.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, he -- it's like any minute he was just gonna pop.  He was just gonna burst.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm saying, you murder five people you can't hold it in for so long.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's like Susan Smith, you know, she drowned her two kids, blame it on the black guy.  Had all the cops out looking for this black guy, [inaudible] she strapped her own kids in the seat and drowned them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, so her fingerprints all over the place.  Though they're her kids and then what she do later on confess.
L:  That's cause she had no choice.
R:  So, what difference did it make whether it was on TV or not?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] What difference did it make?
L:  Not much cause they'll find out eventually.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... did you watch the O.J. t- case?
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] [inaudible] ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  O.J.?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, b- --
R:  I watched it.  What about O.J. case?  What about it?
L:  I don't know, I was just wondering -- I hadn't watched many and those were the only that I could stick, uh --
R:  Yeah, watch it.  How you know about it then?
L:  I -- I just read the paper and listen to TV.  I've never -- I never actually watched the court case on TV I don't think.  I watched a little Judges every now and then but I've never watched a high +profile court case.
R:  So, you think O.J. did it?
L:  I don't know.
R:  You don't know?
L:  [LAUGH] But that gl- -- I mean, what about the glove that his hand wouldn't fit in?
R:  And what about the glove his hand wouldn't fit in?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What about it?
L:  Oh, why would he have a too little glove?
R:  Why would he have a too little glove?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know why they say the glove was too little.
L:  Cause he put it on in court and I did see a picture of that or something.  He put it on in court and his hand wouldn't go in it.
R:  Yeah, because the glove had been in -- in evidence for so long that it had, you know, due to moisture and ... things like that because they had to retrieve the glove from out- outside, then they had to take it to a lab and it was touched over and it was, you know ... it would -- it'd been done a lot -- um, has been in a lot of elements.  Like I say it'd been outdoor, indoor so, you know, and leather gets wet it -- it shrinks.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it dries.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  You know that?  You -- you -- you don't wear y- -- uh, you don't wear like a leather coat or nothing?
L:  Yeah, but I don't know about it shrinking.  I know --
R:  So, how you clean it?  How you clean your leather coat?
L:  I take it to the cleaners.
R:  Take it to the cleaners?  You never tried put it in the washing machine yourself?
L:  No, you can't wash leather.
R:  Yes, you can.
L:  I -- can you?
R:  Yes you can wash leather.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Didn't know that?
L:  That's good.  I ruined something.
R:  [LAUGH]
