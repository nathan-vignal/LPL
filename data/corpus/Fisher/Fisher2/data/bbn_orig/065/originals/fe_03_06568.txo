L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello. [NOISE]
R:  Uh, my name's Beverley, and I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know much about divorce, 'cause I've been married for a long time.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, my name is Sarah, and I -- my parents, personally, are still married, and I am in a long term relationship, but my significant other's parents have each been divorced about three times.  So it has definitely affected my life [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- indeed.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  My -- my daughter's been divorced, but it was a have to case.  I only -- to me it's only good when, you know, it's a hav- -- I think it's too easy most of the time.
L:  I -- I definitely agree. [NOISE]
R:  I mean, it's easier to get married again and again, but ... I myself would -- I say I'd never get divorced, but, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I've been married thirty two years, so ...
L:  Well, congratulations [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Thanks.
L:  -- that's quite good.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  We don't divorce in our family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think you just, you know, have to know going in that it -- it's something, you know, you have to work on it, sure.
L:  I definitely agree.  I think that the fact that it's too easy also makes people look into it, um, as they're going in as sort of like a temporary arrangement.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't really realize that they're actually getting married, as opposed to just dating someone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mm, I think that there's a lack of distinction ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely.
R:  It really hasn't -- I mean, my daughter's the only one that's affected us and it -- it was hard -- it was really hard ...
L:  Yeah, I can imagine.
R:  -- getting a divorce.  Yeah, 'cause they had two little kids, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, it was a custody --
L:  Oh, that's never fun.
R:  -- fight, but ...  No, [NOISE] but there was no problem with it.  She got complete custody, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] he's gotten married twice since, so for him --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- it's just, you know ...
L:  That's destructive on the child's life, definitely.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH] Indeed, that instability is not good [SIGH].
R:  I wouldn't wanna start over again [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's no way.  You get --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- you get so used to someone, it's like, how could you [MN] learn to live with someone else?  But ...
L:  I know.  It's -- it's definitely a bad situation.  I know that, uh, my boyfriend, his parents, as they got remarried multiple times, I mean, it just confused him, because he was really, really young [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he just never really knew how to react during it, because he always expected his family sort of to kind of like dissolve and, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- change.  And so he never really knew, like, who these people in his life really were.  And I think that contributed to a lot of issues --
R:  Oh, it has to.
L:  -- definitely.  Yes.
R:  Yeah, I wish they would just make it harder to get a divorce.  I mean, I -- sometimes it's -- it's not too hard, but they need it to be, I don't know, there has to be something besides just paying money and going down and getting a divorce.
L:  Oh, definitely.  I also think that it needs to be emphasized before people get married, though, so they realize what they're going into.  As opposed to them getting stuck in bad situations --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] that they don't really enter into them without knowing what it's all about.  I think that --
R:  Yeah, there should be a course or something like --
L:  Definitely there --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- should be something that [LAUGH] should tell people that --
R:  You have to have --
L:  -- you know [MN].
R:  Well, even getting into college [MN] you have all these tests and all these steps.  I mean, why couldn't -- I mean, all you do here -- I live in West Virginia -- you take a blood test --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- and that's it, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's nothing else that -- some states you don't even need a blood test, you just --
L:  Oh, I know.  People should definitely be educated about what they're getting into.
R:  Yeah.  I just -- I know some churches have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, different steps that you have to go to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and stuff, but [SIGH] not very many of 'em in our city do that.  It's --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- it's --
L:  And even just for, like, the general population, I mean, you know, people who weren't specific, like, [inaudible] domina- denomination they should [MN] still have a way to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sorta be held accountable for their actions. 
R:  Yeah.  I wish they'd put more shows on like Happy Days, you know, that was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a nice -- no one would have thought of divorce --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LAUGH] on that program, but I do, I wish they'd have more family shows where [LIPSMACK] everybody's married and stays married, but --
L:  Well, I think it would also be nice if they had more shows where they showed people having problems and working them out.
R:  [MN] Well, that's it, if they only knew --
L:  You know, not just, like, ignoring them and pretending that everything's happy, but showing that it is a process that takes work [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that would be good [SIGH].
R:  All these reality shows and they're bound to be able to -- to have one --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I love the Journal, can this marriage be saved?  The Journal magazine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you ever read it?
L:  No, I haven't.  
R:  Oh --
L:  I'll have to look into that.
R:  Oh, it is so good.  Every month that's the first thing [SIGH] I head for.  And it's people that are gonna get a divorce but they have to go to counselling for a year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and almost -- nine times out of ten, when they come back in five years or so, they're still married, because it was something -- they laugh about it, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was something really stupid that they wanted, you know, just over money, one of 'em spending more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on the charge card, or [MN] you know, how the -- tell the kids no, they don't need something, or ... [NOISE]
L:  Definitely, yeah.
R:  But I love that, because it does -- it -- that could be a really good TV series.
L:  Yeah, that would be good.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Definitely.  
R:  [NOISE] Yes, you got a boo boo right there, well sit down.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my little granddaughters --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they have a boo boo [NOISE].
L:  Oh, no.
R:  But it wasn't a boo boo.  Anything that they touch, it's a boo boo.
L:  Oh [LAUGH]. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In that case, it's not so bad.  
R:  Ah, no [NOISE] -- no, they just like to -- like to be held for a minute, I think.
L:  Right, definitely.
R:  But [MN] it -- the only time it's affected me is just my daughter, no one else, and ... [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  My brother and my sisters have all been married forever.  My parents've been married fifty eight years, so --
L:  Wow, that's impressive.
R:  Yeah.  It's just [LIPSMACK] I think because our family [NOISE] believes, you know, you pick the right one and you stay married, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] you just don't go out and [NOISE] -- my -- my daughter's case it was, it was a have to.
L:  Right, and there are always those situations --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- where it's absolutely necessary, but it just shouldn't be, like, used sort of as a, [SIGH] "Oops, I wasn't entirely ready" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, "I didn't know this person well enough" [SIGH].
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, a lot of times if they try a trial separation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's like the guy just wants to go out with his buddies again and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and keep on going.  And then they don't wanna be married back again --
L:  Definitely.
R:  So, [SIGH] to me, that would [NOISE] -- I don't think the trial separations help much.
L:  Yeah, I don't think so either.  
R:  [NOISE] But I would make it -- golly, I wish they would give [NOISE] -- they'd give all these special income tax [NOISE] for, you know, really dumb things sometimes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so they should do one for marriage or something, just to [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- they can --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- pass a new law --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- stay married five years or ten years and you get a bonus. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [MN] Definitely.  I think it's more [MN], um, of a traumatic experience when there are children involved, definitely.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because at that point, you're not just, you know, making a decision that affects your life --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but the lives of people that you are in charge of raising --
R:  Oh yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think that [MN] -- I mean, I think that that's much more unexcusable than someone who's young and has no dependents.  
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, that's --
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  And a lot of 'em can't agree on having kids or not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- having kids, and ... [NOISE]
L:  Definitely.  
R:  It didn't work for us -- we just had 'em [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Then they was here. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  But I guess people's religion has a lot to do with it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- too, but -- it depends on how good daddy is, but [MN] ...  This is really a -- one of the hardest [NOISE] --
L:  It really is --
R:  -- subjects.
L:  -- a difficult topic.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some of the other ones are easier to talk about, but --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- I guess if I'd had a divorce, then I could say, "Yes, I believe it". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  
R:  [NOISE] There's not that much [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  What state are you from?
L:  Um, Washington.
R:  Oh, my.  You --
L:  Indeed.  Quite far away.
R:  Yeah.  You're on the opposite coast.
L:  Yes.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, all we have is rain here for the past month.
L:  Oh, we're used to rain --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- but it's been sunny for the past few days, which is definitely a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] refreshing [SIGH] state of weather to be in [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  We need sun here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Really cold.  [LIPSMACK] I don't even think [NOISE] -- all my neighbors have been married forever.  I'm trying to think of -- we're in the forty age group --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everybody here gets married kinda young, in their teens and then [NOISE] I guess you just grow up together, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Polly, my next door neighbor, they've been married forever.  And one across the street.  Oh, no, the one beside them, they've been, um -- she's been divorced and he has too, but they've been together, like, fifteen years in this one.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Golly, none of my neighbors besides that one -- I think they all just [NOISE] ... but maybe it's the neighborhood --
