L:  Hi, this is Caroline.
R:  Hello.  This is Mark.
L:  Hi, Mark.
R:  Hello.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good, Caroline.  How about yourself?
L:  Good.  What is the topic?  I didn't understand [inaudible] don't have a good connection so I didn't hear what they exactly looking for?
R:  Oh, she said the topic, uh, was on drug testing, and do you feel that uh companies uh that require drug testing is an infringement of personal rights, uh, particularly when it's unannounced, things like that.  So --
L:  Yeah, hold --
R:  -- I guess we -- so I guess we discuss that for about ten minutes.
L:  Oh, it's gonna take ten minutes?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't want you to hang up in less than ten minutes, or you don't get -- you don't get your --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- your check, so --
L:  So, we're -- we're supposed to talk about what?
R:  It's drug -- it's company drug testing, whether you think it's an infringement on personal rights.
L:  Oh, drug testing?  Um, well, I think --
R:  Company -- companies -- companies that require drug testing, right.
L:  Yeah, I don't think they should --
R:  That you work for.
L:  Yeah, I -- what do you think about that topic?
R:  Oh, I don't know.  I don't think it's an infringement of personal rights.  I guess, uh, you know, companies have the right to make sure that they have a safe work place and -- and if you want to work at a place and -- and uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and they don't --
L:  It's up to you --
R:  -- require it, you know, it -- it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They don't want you to work -- uh, use drugs, I guess that's the best way to check, is to -- is to require --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- drug testing.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's -- that way is much safer.
R:  I don't -- I don't believe --
L:  And I --
R:  Yeah, I don't believe in taking drugs and -- and uh, I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's -- it's illegal, plus I don't think you need to pollute your body, so it doesn't bother --
L:  Exact-
R:  -- me that that's a requirement, 'cause I don't take drugs.  I would never --
L:  Mm.  Right.
R:  It would -- and uh, I don't want to be around in a work place that peop- where people use drugs either, so --
L:  Yeah, on drugs and -- yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.
R:  So -- 
L:  It's not a safe environment like that.
R:  So what do you think?
L:  Um, I -- I share -- I totally agree with you.  I think it was -- um, I think, uh, to begin with, these days, should be taking drugs, so -- you know, they should be having a test at the place you work at, just to make sure that they're telling the truth and you're not on drugs.
R:  Yeah.  As drugs -- there are actually going to be safety issues to people around yourself, uh -- um --
L:  Right.
R:  I don't even like to be around people that smoke, so and to me, smoke's a drug, too, so -- cigarettes are, so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.
R:  But, uh, as far as -- as far as the drugs that you inject into your body, you know, there's -- you know, if you want to -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  It's illegal, but if you want to do that in the confines of your own home, I guess that's one thing, but uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a work place, around other people, I don't think you should be allowed to do it, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I just think there are certain things in this society 'cause your -- your work -- it is -- it is a society so you have to -- you have to respect people around you, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then companies also have a liability issue --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if you come to work and you're on drugs and you're operating machinery and things like that and you injure somebody, so --
L:  Right.  Do you know of any of these companies?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Do you know of any of these companies that do require testing?
R:  Oh, I mean, there's -- I think there's -- yeah, I -- I know quite a few.  You know, if you work for the federal government they're -- in certain position, they require drug testing.
L:  Right.
R:  And um for law enforcement positions, things like that, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I believe in it.  I guess if you don't wanna -- number one, you shouldn't be taking drugs, and I guess if you don't wanna be tested --
L:  And if you are, you --
R:  -- then you --
L:  -- shouldn't be working there.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's your choice, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I uh --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I don't, uh, I think it -- I think it'd be remiss if they didn't check, so --
L:  And that would be the requirements the uh work places have, so if you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you think it's wrong, then you shouldn't even um -- you know, try to work there.
R:  Right.  So do you know some companies that require drug testing?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Do you know some companies that require drug testing?
L:  Oh.  No, actually I've never actually talked about this topic.  My first time --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I actually was -- yeah, I never needed to worry about it to begin with, so --
R:  Well, I hadn't either, except where I work --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they do -- they do that, but I don't care, so --
L:  Oh, really?  Oh.
R:  I don't -- doesn't bother me.  Because, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I don't use drugs and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and uh, so --
L:  No need for that.
R:  I don't -- I don't think that's an infringement on somebody's rights.  I think it's protecting other people's rights around you, so --
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  I see.  So this -- this is supposed to last for ten minutes?
R:  This goes on for ten minutes, yeah.  Sometimes it's a long -- I think it's a long ten minutes at times, so --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  So, is this your first time doing this?
L:  Um, actually, yeah, this is my first time doing this.  What about you?
R:  Yeah, it's my sec- this is my second one, so we just gotta -- we gotta talk for ten minutes and when ten minutes are up, a recording comes on and says, "You only have a few seconds left", so --
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, it warns us too, then?
R:  Yeah, but uh, you -- you have to go ten -- ten minutes and -- overall, so or else, um --
L:  Do they listen to you like this, or uh, do they record, uh, what we're talking about?
R:  I'm assuming it's a recording.
L:  Oh, yeah, it's a recording.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know if there's somebody listening.  I don't -- I don't know, so -- but --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- you know, what we're supposed to be doing is just talking about the --
L:  Yeah, the drug testing.
R:  -- the topic itself, so --
L:  Yeah, the topic itself.
R: -- and uh, I don't know what --
L:  Yeah, but um --
R:  There's not --
L:  Have you --
R:  To me, there's not that much to say about it, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- except that I just don't believe it's an --
L:  'Cause I never actually really worked anywhere in an environment that required a drug testing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, I just never really had to worry about it.  So -- but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do believe they should have this, and uh, it's not -- I don't think it's invading anybody's um privacy.  This is something that the people need to know about, if you're on drugs or not.
R:  Well, I agree.
L:  I think --
R:  I don't think I -- it -- it's uh, it's nothing I've worried about too much, but I think it's becoming --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- more and more common.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think more companies are doing it, because uh --
L:  Yeah.  A lot of people --
R:  -- it's --
L:  -- are on actu- yeah.  
R:  Yeah, and there's a -- there's a lot of liabilities issues, too you know, so it's a -- you can get sued --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and somebody --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, somebody is -- is operating heavy equipment or something, or if they're in law enforcement and they use drugs all the time and they misuse the equipment or -- or they don't do their job correc- properly and somebody gets injured, then they're gonna end up -- the company's gonna get sued, so --
L:  Right.
R:  So a part of it's uh -- you know, it's a liability and the companies do that for self protection too, so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's --
R:  And uh, this day and age, you need to.  In this country, people sue for everything, you know, so --
L:  Mm.  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- any little thing that comes up, so --
L:  Especially with this issue's really important 'cause I think a lot of, uh, um, there are many people that actually on these drugs and they need to find out who they are and, you know, I guess is a way, by doing these kind of testing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, like I said, I -- I never use drugs, and I'm assuming you don't either, huh?
L:  Yeah.   No, I don't either, no.  No.
R:  Yeah, I just think it's --
L:  Like, I'm not too worried about the -- you know, having the drugs available.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I'm not either, so I mean, I work for a company that, uh -- organization that does that every so often, to --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- in certain categories and it doesn't bother --
L:  Right.
R:  -- me a bit, and I've never -- actually, I've never heard anybody talking[?] about it, because uh, you know, if uh you're a drug user, you probably shouldn't be working, then, at these places, you know?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, only the -- only the drug users that are really worried about having this kind of test available.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think, yeah, some people would feel that any kind of, uh, er, intrusion into your privacy is -- is a -- is -- is -- is wrong, but uh, you know it's just certain things have to happen in this -- in this society because of -- you know, we -- we live and work around people, you know, so --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, you have to know what kind of people you're around with.
R:  Yeah, you just -- you just can't do anything you want because what you might -- what you do might have a negative impact --
L:  Affect other people.
R:  -- yeah, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- particularly if you're using drugs, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, and um --
L:  Besides, they -- they might be high or they might -- you know, they might do something very dangerous that affects other people around you and, you know, who's going to be liable for the person that will -- you know, that was responsible for it, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And then the company that hires you, too, they're gonna get -- they're gonna be liable, too.
L:  Exactly, and they're gonna go -- yeah.  
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they're gonna be taken to court and -- and uh, so -- but anyway, uh, um, and I think, you know, there's still -- there's still a lot of drug use --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that goes on in this country, so that's what -- uh, you know --
L:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.
R:  -- things have come to that.  So -- 
L:  And, you know, even though they're illegal drugs, they still take it and it's very dangerous.
R:  Yeah.  So -- but uh --
L:  I guess it's the same way, you know, just having like, you know, when you take -- you drinking or you know, drinking and driving, you know, or they -- if you do get a ticket, the police are gonna come and take a test --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to make sure, you know?  So I guess the same thing, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Because I mean --
R:  Yeah, the --
L:  -- at least it's required and it's not in any -- anybody's privacy.  
R:  Yeah, and the police can stop you on the road and -- when you're driving --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and test you for --
L:  Yeah, you're regulating[?] the rules by drinking --
R:  -- for drunkenness.
L:  -- and driving, so they obviously --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- need to take a test, and you know -- have the proof.
R:  It's all -- it's all a matter of -- of safety, you know.  Safety and liability --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what it boils down to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [MN].
R:  But, uh, anyway, it's uh --
L:  Definitely.  This is definitely some uh testing they should have.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That means --
R:  And -- yeah.  Luckily, I don't even actually -- any of the friends I have don't even use drugs anyway, so I'm not --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- I'm not even around that -- that -- that culture --
L:  Exactly, environment.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  And uh and also I think that --
L:  I guess --
R:  -- I think drugs --
L:  -- there's mainly the young people now.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, like -- I think that's what it is.
R:  Or in certain -- certain circles, too you know, many people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at parties, you know, use them I guess, but uh --
L:  Depending who you are hanging around with or the culture --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or you know?  Yeah.  The whole atmosphere.
R:  But I uh -- I don't -- I think it's uh -- I think it pollutes your body with those things, so I -- I stay away from them, so --
L:  Mhm.  Definitely.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, I mean, if it's not good for you, you should not bother yourself getting involved, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Definitely -- you should definitely have --
R:  And so --
L:  -- this -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- testing.
R:  I agree.  I agree, and -- and -- and I don't know -- it doesn't -- it doesn't bother me in a bit -- in the slightest, so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't know what else -- I don't know what else to talk about on this subject because --
L:  I know.  Me too.  [LAUGH].
R:  -- it's a --
L:  This is a pretty tough -- uh, subject.
R:  But -- but uh --
L:  Can't get any tougher.
R:  -- 'cause I -- yeah, 'cause I just don't -- plain and simple, the question was, do you think those things are an infringement of your rights, and I -- I don't believe they are --
L:  No, I don't think so, no, 'cause you know, you gonna be -- um, you shouldn't bother starting to begin with, taking these drugs, so you know --
