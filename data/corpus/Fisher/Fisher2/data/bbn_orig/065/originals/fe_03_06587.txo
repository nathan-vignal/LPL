R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.  Hello.
R:  Yes.  Hi.  My name's Ken.
L:  Hi, Ken.  My name's Laura.
R:  +How you doing, Laura?
L:  Okay.  How are you?
R:  Okay.  Um, uh, they said the -- the topic is family values.
L:  Yeah, it sounds like it's family values and whether or not, uh, the divorce rate in this country affects your opinion on the institution of marriage?
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Oh, well, I don't know.  I guess, yeah, I tend to think that as far as that goes the family values have dropped, uh, quite [LAUGH] -- quite --
L:  Quite a bit.
R:  -- a bit.
L:  Quite a bit.
R:  Yeah.  And I think the divorce rate is up and, you know, um, I don't know, uh, I -- I don't know.  I guess years ago they +used to have, what, like, things -- families [MN] -- well, they had [MN] really had families years ago.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, mother, father and the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- children.  And they used to eat dinner together and, you know, do things together and Sunday drives and things like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I don't know.  This -- these days is, I guess, you have more single families.  You have marriages that don't last long.  Um, you had -- uh, years ago they had people, you know, remember they used to celebrate their anniversaries, you know, after ten years, fifteen years --
L:  Exactly.  It was --
R:  -- twenty.
L:  It was [MN] -- and other people acknowledged it too.  It seems like -- I'm kind of amazed, we just -- [MN] I mean, it's not like it's our fiftieth wedding anniversary --
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  -- but we celebrated our fifth.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um --
R:  Well, I'm --
L:  But it was like no -- not -- no one acknowledged it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know what I mean?  People just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind are like whatever with it.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  It -- it seems a shame.
R:  Right.  I know.  'Cause I -- they don't last as long these days.  I -- if -- if -- like, if you're going to get to that five or ten, you're really doing [MN] something these days.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  I think, you know -- I think the -- I tend -- I tend to think the average is way down for, like, three, four, you know, really short years together.
L:  Right.  And I think the rate is -- isn't the rate something like [MN] one in two marriages get divorced, something like -- yeah.
R:  Right.  Yeah, the divorce rate is so high.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's terrible.  
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know. 
L:  -- it's -- I -- I don't really understand what people think when they, you know, enter into it.  That it's kind of, like, "Well, if it doesn't work out well, just, you know --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- get out of it".  And that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- strange that for some reason that attitudes, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- come about.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I know.  And, um I think it also is -- is trickling down to, um, as far as why you have so much, um, things as far as children these days.  They're -- they're -- they're having a lot less, you know, respect for older people.  The adults and everything.  And, um, you know they -- they get in so much more, I guess, violence and negative things in school these days, you know.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think years ago who would ever have thought of, you know, children carrying guns to school and stuff like that.  [MN]
L:  Oh, it's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, I know, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I mean it's --
R:  It's -- it's like, you know, back when it was, like, unheard of, you [LAUGH] know.
L:  Right.
R:  And [several inaudible words] it's almost like a natural or normal thing these days, you know.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it --
R:  You -- you know, you're always hearing about it.
L:  -- seems so strange to me, like, uh, you know, it's -- it's not so much to me the -- the different kind of families that are out there.  Whether it's a single mom or a single dad or -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  Um, [MN] that sort of thing that it's -- to me it's just more of the kind of values that are [MN] -- kids are not being paid attention to one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- way or the other.  It doesn't -- to me it's [MN] -- it's a family if, uh, it's a group that's a household that, uh, care and love -- love each other and take care of the children and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everybody takes care of one another.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, it seems like somewhere along the [LAUGH] line there's been a -- a definite drop in, um, in --in the value system and I just -- I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't understand when that really came about.  When [inaudible] --
R:  I think -- I think -- well, I think it was a slow progress.  I think, um -- I remember years ago, um, I guess maybe as younger people [MN] -- [several inaudible words] -- maybe younger people, as -- as, uh, people were, you know, I don't know, you know, like, get out ther and may -- and maybe would fuss and curse at the children when they're really young, you know.  And -- and [MN] I don't know -- I think as those children grew up maybe they weren't loved as much, or whatever, and as they grew up they had their own kids and -- and they just -- you know, they just turned, uh, I guess less loving, you know, or caring for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- their own children.  And it's -- you know, it just kind of reflected, you know, down through their lives and -- and -- and I guess the way laws have changed where, you know, you got the right to [MN] and even when they -- I thought burning the American flag, when they said, oh, that was okay, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  I thought that was, sort of, like, one of the worst things [LAUGH] you could have done.  It's like, you know, it's -- it's like you -- you used to have, like, a respect or a certain --
L:  Right.
R:  For [MN] -- even for your [inaudible] -- for your family, for your country, you know, for yourself, whatever.  And I think all these things --
L:  Respect for [MN] yeah, the whole -- the whole institution. 
R:  Right.
L:  I mean --
R:  Has taken a toll and -- and I think all that has changed you know.  Changed a lot of things.
L:  Well, and I think the media's had a large part of it.  People watch, uh, you know, these --
R:  Right.
L:  -- celebrities that they watch --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on TV that -- and after a couple of years they're getting, like, wh- which kind of floors me, annulments.  You know, even if the --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- people have been married, you know, several years they get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They somehow swing annulments.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um, you know, and they're talking about dividing up, you know, their -- their vast fortunes and everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I think people are just going into, um, the whole -- the whole concept of marriage.  That it's -- that -- I don't -- I'm curious that there -- that a lot of people kind of think -- ha- have the impression that it's something that's easy.  If anything it -- it -- one of the questions on it was, has that impacted my viewpoint of it?  It's made me realise that, um --
R:  Has.
L:  -- it's -- it's really -- that marriage is something you really do have to work at.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, on a -- on a daily basis.
R:  Oh, yeah, I think so.
L:  You know.
R:  I -- I think so.
L:  I mean, you have to -- you really have to make it work.  It's -- it's -- it's -- it's fairly easy to love somebody.  It's a whole different ballgame to live with them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  
R:  Exact- --
L:  That's -- that's the hard part.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  I -- I found that out too.  Right.  You're absolutely right.
L:  Yeah, I mean [MN] --
R:  You can be friends with a person.  You know, you can probably see a person just about everyday for years and get along and [MN] it's not as bad 'cause you can always kind of go away and have your own space.
L:  Right.
R:  But when you're living under the same roof and there's -- day in and day out and you have to really, you know, adapt to other things that this per- -- you know, habits.  This person's habits you may or may not like.  And, you know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they have to adapt to you and, you know, have a way of, sort of, I don't know, maybe as far as like getting away from him, you know.  I -- I tend to say, you know, when you're dating someone you can always, "Okay, I had enough of this person.  I can go home now --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- to my own space".  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, it's a different story when you're wed.  You're under the same roof and everything and -- and you got to, sort of, stay under that constant grind in a sense, you know.  So it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is --
L:  And I'm -- I --
R:  -- something you work at.  
L:  I'm -- I'm kind of surprised that with the -- the divorce rate is -- is -- is what it is in an era where it's, and I mean I don't feel one way really, right, wrong or indifferent, about this but, um, the fact that people are living together a lot more before --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they get married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you think it's almost like they get kind of, like, a trial sense.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Most people are too much on their good behaviour.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know and they're -- they're in that hole, you know.
R:  Right
L:  It's all new and different kind of phase --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, then it -- it takes a whole lot more to make it work once you're -- once you're past that initial ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  
L:  You know.
R:  'Cause, you know, it -- it seems like people can -- they can kind of live together I think longer, you know, not being married than they can live together being married, you know.
L:  Yeah, kind of seems that way.
R:  'Cause -- 'cause I guess they feel like, you know, [MN] you have that bond there or [MN], you know, now you're bound to 'em that y- you got to do certain things or -- or you can't do other things that you might want to do
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And, you always feel like when you're just living together as friends, or whatever, you can kind of always, sort of, walk away, you know.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words].  You figure the door's sort of still kind of open for you.  
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  [MN]  I'm glad --
L:  And it -- it -- it just -- it -- and it kind of seems to me that, uh, people are -- people look at it as being so- something so legal and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] you know, it's -- it's --it's this paper that binds them by the law and, um, I -- I don't know.  I -- I don't think too many people look at it for what it really is, which is a sacrament.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's something that's, um, you know, deemed under -- deemed under God and -- and you're married in a church and that -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that to me is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the real connection.
R:  [MN]
L:  Not whether or not, you know, you've signed a legal document.
R:  Right.  'Cause, yeah, you're right.  I don't think people take it as seriously as they should.  [MN]
L:  No.  No.
R:  There's -- there's more [MN] okay, I'll do this and -- and, you know, go through this procedure but they don't really, you know, get into the real meaning of what they're doing or -- or the actions that they're taking and everything.  And, you know, maybe some- sometime- -- I guess watching, like, Jerry Springer -- I don't know if you've watched that show.  [LAUGH]  Every now and then I watch that and you know -- you know, even [MN] -- sometimes th- they showed us a few weeks of whatever they're -- maybe, you know, they've been cheating or they got tired of that person or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not what they really wanted, you know.  And they're off, you know, doing things that they, you know, shouldn't even -- or even like -- even before they got married.  The night before their wedding they -- they ran off with someone else or they -- they had an affair with someone else.  You know --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's -- stuff like that is just so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's a -- oh, I've seen some of those shows.  It's -- yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- [NOISE] it's amazing to me how people just -- they -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't -- I don't -- I'd be curious to know how many people are influenced by, like, their parents and their other peers about how they get to a certain age and if they haven't found that person they -- you know, they're forced to the issue to kind of like, "Oh, when are you going to get married?"  You know, that kind of thing.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, it's always the societal kind of pressure thing, you know.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like when you're [MN] -- like, maybe when you get out of school then it's, "Oh, okay, so you seeing anybody?"  And then, "Oh, are you serious?"  [several inaudible words] and when you get engaged it's, "Oh, when are you going to get married?"  And then once you're married it's, "Okay, when are you going to have kids?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.  I mean, there's this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- constant group pressure and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I would say that would probably have some sort of an -- an influence on, uh, the statistic.  Um --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  You know.
R:  -- guess.  I -- I -- I, yeah, I'm not sure.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  I think of, uh, people did -- I think [MN] did kind of pressure you years ago.  I don't know if they pressure you as much these days because, like, like I said, to me marriage isn't taken as seriously as before, you know.
L:  People just kind of jump into it.  
R:  Yeah.  Jump in and jump back out of it again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  I -- I --
R:  [MN]  You know.
L:  -- don't -- I don't know why but, uh, it makes me feel like I -- I'd want to -- I'd want to work at it harder.  
R:  Yeah, I know --
L:  It really does, you know.
R:  -- 'cause [MN] I -- I was married, I guess, once before and I'm not married at the moment, but I said that if I did get married again I always wanted to be, you know
