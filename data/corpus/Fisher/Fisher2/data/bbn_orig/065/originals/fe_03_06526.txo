L:  My name is Lisa.
R:  Hi, my name is Jackie.
L:  Hi Jackie.  I'm sorry, I could not understand the topic.
R:  Yeah.  Um, it said that in businesses do you agree with the fact about the testing for drugs?  Do you think it's a fair practice?  Or do you think it's not a fair practice?  That's what I -- uh, they say it's all fair so --
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:   Yes.
L:  This is my first time.  I think it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- is a fair practice.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's fair too.  So, I'll let you -- you want to talk for a while?
L:  Sure.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Now, I'm sorry, so, do you want to go first?
R:  Yeah, we -- we just talk about it.  Um, uh, this is my -- this is my third conversation, you know, so I know.  If you want me to say first a little while and then you could --
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I believe that it's a fair thing because, I mean, if the company's paying all this money to the employee, I think they should have the right to see if their employee is, you know, high on drugs.  If the person is high on drugs while they're doing their job, there could be very bad complications as far as, um, they could probably fall asleep.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, they may not be doing their work with high productivity.  And also, um, you know, who knows what they can do if they're -- if they're high on drugs.  Maybe they can steal from a coworker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- look in a coworker's purse and say well th- -- um, well maybe I need five dollars for drugs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think it's very fair for them to test for drugs.  And if the person does have, like, any kinda drug in their system, uh, maybe try to get them help or maybe suspend for thirty says,; send them to, uh, +rehabilitation.  Maybe they shouldn't lose their job right away but it think it's very important because if I was somebody, the head of a company, I would -- I definitely wouldn't want somebody working for me that's high on drugs.  I would be, you know, scared --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of that person.  I don't know what they would do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, what do you think about that.
L:  I agree with you.  I think that since drugs affect an employee's performance, that just as an employer has, uh, can utilize any other assessments to see if someone is a good employee, that this is another assessment they can use to see if this is an employee worth keeping or not.  Because --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- yeah I think the drugs affect, you know, just like, uh, any other of your +personality traits affect your, um, work performance.  And so I agree that I don't feel that is an invasion of my privacy and I don't feel -- and I feel more comfortable going to businesses where I know they test for drugs.  'Cause I feel like I -- I can trust them with, um, the product they're putting out if they test their employees for drugs regardless of whether it's a McDonalds or whether it's, you know, North West Airlines.
R:  Right.  I agree with you very much.  And I don't think it's an invasion of privacy at all because after all, the company is paying the person quite a lot of money and also they get medical benefits.  Now let's say the person is on drugs and they're sick a lot.  I mean, they're paying the medical benefit for that person.  They were also losing, you know, time and days, you know, 'cause when people get high they may call up; if they get high on a weekend or something like that, they may call up on a Monday and want to continue their drug binge or whatever it be, alcohol or whatever.  And then they -- they're going to be absent and that's gonna affect the other coworkers too.  They're going to have to pick up the slack of the next person and do a lot more work.  So, yeah, I think it's -- I think it's a very encouraging thing for them to test for drugs.  And I don't know why a lot of people are against that.  I don't understand why.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  'Cause, you know, you're right, it does affect the work environment as well as the work product.
R:  Right.
L:  And also, I don't know how they're gonna -- if drugs were legalized, I don't think that  at that point, I don't know if they could get away with testing for drugs because basically I think that the basis for them testing for drugs now is that it's -- that these are illegal substances so --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- I don't know if they could get away with it if -- or they could test for drugs if any of these substances were be -- were to become legal.  Because then it would be, [LIPSMACK] um, you know --
R:  Right.  I agree with you.  The only thing I'm a little bit against; I'm b- -- I'm happy if they would test for drugs like cocaine, marijuana and things like that.  But if they test a person's blood; let's say the person has a asthma problem and they take some kind of asthma pills --
L: Uh-huh. 
R:  -- or maybe anemia, you know, I don't think that they should have the right to test for everything that's in the blood.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think they should look for specific drugs that would affect, you know, the company policy.  What I'm trying to say is let's say a person has anemia and they test the person's blood, you know, and the person comes out with a pill that they're taking to make their blood platelets stronger or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for anemia.  And then they have that on the +medical -- medical record in the company, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then what if they say, "Well, I don't know if I really want to keep this employee.  Maybe she's gonna be sluggish --" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- being that she has, like, anemia or something like that".  So, like, I thought maybe it should be, like, a specific, you know, um, a numerous amount of specific, like, drugs they're looking for.  Maybe ten type of drugs.  What do you think about that?
L:  I agree.  And I don't know whether it's regulated or not that they can only say look for barbiturates and opiates.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  
R:  Right.
L:  And I agree that -- that if someone's doing a drug test, and perhaps since it's an independent lab that does it, the independent lab knows that they can only do, you know, screen  for, uh, barbiturates and opiates.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they know that they can't screen for anything else.  And then there's a regulator that comes in and says, "You know, why are you", you know, that looks at the drug screens and says --
R:  Right.
L:  "-- you know, you -- y- --"  
R:  Well, yeah.  I agree with --
L:  "-- you guys are within the guidelines of --"
R:  Right.  I agree with you.  'Cause can you imagine if someone has an illness; any type of slight --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- illness.  And they do take a -- a pill for that.  And it comes out in the blood test and then they're, like, well I don't really know if I like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I like this person taking this thing.  You know, maybe it's gonna affect the, uh, the benefits I -- I pay.  Like, if the person has anemia something like six months from now, then I have to pay, like, more, especially if it's, like, a small company.  Oh, I might have to pay a lot of medical benefits if that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- person is out for two weeks.  So, that's when -- that's when it gets, like, s- -- kinda hairy, you know, what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That -- that's where I think there's a problem.  So ...
L:  'Cause I agree 'cause then it -- it -- it may provide them a basis to discriminate, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- against the handicapped.  Do you remember that film Philadelphia?
R:  Yes.  I do.
L:  And he found -- I think it was called the airline act where you couldn't discriminate on the basis of handicap and specifically, you know, you would hope that pup- -- [inaudible] that employers don't use, um, drug panels to discriminate, um, against people who have asthma or any chronic illness, you know.
R:  Right.  Definitely.
L:  And you don't know if they do or not?  You don't -- you don't know what -- so, I guess, you know, there are, you know, anything to the extreme you kinda worry about 'cause you don't want people gathering personal information about you.
R:  Right.  Definitely.
L:  As well.  So, it it's just, you know, for bit- -- -obituates, um, a- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, opiates, then fine.  But I don't want anybody gathering anything other than that type of information.
R:  Right.  Definitely.  Definitely.  Because that's personal if someone has, I mean, everyone in the world might have a little health problem; something minor --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they may take a pill for that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then if that comes up, you know, they -- they may reach a conclusion where they say, "Well, I don't believe that this person, you know, has this illness".  Meanwhile they're taking the pill for a different illness too.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Because there's various drugs nowadays that treat various ailments.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, they can run to the wrong conclusion.  I mean, someone could be taking something for anemia, and someone could be taking something for; maybe they have a problem with inflammation in their toe.  I mean, you know, just -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- an example; we don't know.  And if they're -- they're jumping to the wrong conclusion, there could be big problems.  So, I don't know if, um, you know, I think maybe if they do test for drugs, it has to be a specific paper the person signs and maybe just a list of five or ten drugs they're looking for.  Because I can't see any -- any more than five or ten drugs.  You know, that -- that's illegal.  Maybe there is, I'm not too sure but, you know, I think there should be a specific guideline for that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  [inaudible] thinks that there are probably two or -- I know that there're +barbiturates and opiates.  But I can't think if there are any more classes of drugs that are controlled.  I [MN] 
R:  Right.  Right.  And then can you imagine a person got their tooth pulled, and you know, how the dentist gives you codeine number three --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- because that's, like, you know, the -- or -- or any -- any type of thing.  They give you a pain killer maybe codeine number three.  That has cocaine in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but that's prescribed by a dentist.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're not going to believe you if that comes out.  What happens if they just says, "Okay", after you were there six years and they quickly give you a drug test.  They're not going to believe you -- you took codeine number three; you got your tooth pulled.  They're going to say, "Oh, my goodness, this person took cocaine".
L:  Now does your employer use a drug test?
R:  Yes.  My employer did.  The one I -- I -- the per- -- the previous one I was -- did.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  I was there for about three years in this previous company and on the third year they came out with that and they did do that.  And I don't think too many people were upset.
L:  Mm.
R:  How about your company?
L:  Well, I used to work for an airline and so they did a drug test to -- in order to be employed there.  And then they did random drug tests after that.  But my --
R:  Right.
L:  -- new employer, which is just a -- a time share company does not -- did not do any drug testing.
R:  Right, right.  Because some o- -- some of them don't, you know.  And some of them do.
L:  'Cause it's, you know, [LIPSMACK] 'cause some, uh, some, you know, like, with an airline it's required.  But, um, with other business it's -- it maybe just a matter of how much money they have and they may drug test different classes of employees.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they may assume that anybody making over, you know, which is un- un- --
