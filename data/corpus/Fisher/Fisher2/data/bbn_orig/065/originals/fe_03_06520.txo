L:  Hi, my name is Ramona.
R:  Hey, this is Stan.
L:  How are you?
R:  Not too bad.
L:  That's good.  That's good.  You working?
R:  Uh, nope.  I'm watching my room mate play a video game.
L:  Haha.  Oh, I mean, do you work?
R:  Oh.  Uh, yeah I do.
L:  Yeah.  Do they test -- do they test you for drugs?
R:  Um, I don't think they do.
L:  Oh.  You're lucky.  [LAUGH].  A lot --
R:  I think --
L:  -- of companies I hear up here -- where are you from?
R:  Uh, I live up in Seattle.
L:  Oh, wow.  Seattle, Washington?
R:  Yeah.  I think, uh, I think companies up here probably do it, but not the place I work 'cause it's just like a little juice bar.  
L:  Oh, oh, I see.  Oh yeah, not a bar.  [LAUGH].  Well, no, it's a juice bar?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  In New York they do.  I'm in New York, New York.  They do it a lot.
R:  Oh, right.  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  What do you think about that?
L:  Um, I think maybe it is an invasion of people's privacy, because as long as they can do their job and do it right, then it shouldn't be a problem if a person smoked marijuana or whatever they want to do at home --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- or on the weekends.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  Ah, I think if it's perfecting or if it's -- if it's impacting your performance at work, then uh --
L:  Then you should be tested.
R:  Yeah.  Then they should have a little talk with you, but if you're --
L:  Well --
R:  -- doing a good job, well then, you know just a normal employee, I don't think -- I don't think they should be able to just say, "All right, let's test you for some cocaine now".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just oh, up out of the blue for no reason.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In a way, it is because um, I don't know.  I know a lot of people in programs and stuff.  Like, in my building, they come from programs, they come from division A services, they come from shelters.  
R:  Yeah?
L:  And um a lot of people from the programs are doing their thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And um, it's like they -- they -- they can work, but they -- they -- they're prohibited from working because of what they do on the weekends or whatever and it's not right because then, okay, they have, um, uh a lot of people here on public assistance and um -- or SSI.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So then they tell you, "Well, if you're getting public assistance, you have to work", or  if you get SSI, if you do drugs, you can't -- you know.  I don't know.  Uh, for a person that was -- that had a history of alcoholism, right --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- well, say they stop drinking?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then they take a drink every now and then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then they would be automatically put in a program or shunned just because they had a drink, but they're not an alcoholic any more.
R:  Yeah.  I think, uh, I think it's -- it's discrimination in a sense.  
L:  You think so?  How?
R:  Uh, I mean, the -- the testing and -- I mean, just like you were talking about, like you know, if somebody wants to have a little -- a little drink every now and then or -- you know, get stoned on the weekends, that's --
L:  Yeah, on their time off.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, not on the job, but uh, it seems like it kind of discriminates against people that do that.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, your time off, it's like they're ruling what you do on your time off too.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And that's not right.  If -- if -- if my performance is not affecting by what I do on the weekends or whatever, then I don't think, you know, and I wonder what they're doing about it?  You heard anything?
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I -- I don't know.  Um, it is kinda hard to be responsible, though.  I mean, uh, it's kinda hard to know where to draw the line of uh, you know, if you do too much on the weekend, obviously you're gonna be -- be a little trashed on Monday morning.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And then if --
L:  But if -- if you can do your job, then it's none of their business --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really.
R:  Totally.
L:  And that's just the bottom line.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you can't do your job, then you get fired.  Simple as that.  I mean, with all this in between, I -- I'm wondering if -- are they talking about doing anything about it?  You heard anything lately? On the news --
R:  I --
L:  -- or in the papers?
R:  Uh, no.  I think it's -- it's pretty much up to the company.  I mean, when you get hired, you say, "You're gonna pay me money to work for you and I'm gonna do what you want".
L:  Yeah, I can understand, but you know what?  Some people don't want to take chances because they hired the wrong person in the beginning and then they come up, they come -- starting being late all the time, they tell you all the good stuff when you get the job --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they don't be -- I can see where companies are coming from.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They make -- they make the mistake of hiring a bad addict -- addict who can't really do a job --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they lose money 'cause they -- they're not getting the job done, well, yes they did hire this person, now they gotta go and hire somebody else.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So I can see where a company probably comes from with that, too.
R:  Yeah.  So it's a sticky issue.  I mean, if you can see both sides pretty well.  
L:  Mm?
R:  It's -- it's a difficult issue, if you can understand both sides.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where the company's coming from.
L:  Yeah, I guess a company would lose money if they have to keep rehiring people just because, um, they hired the wrong person.
R:  And -- yeah.  And money, company losing money.  That's what it's all about in the mix, you know?  That's all they really care about.
L:  I could see maybe initial testing, but all during the performance, only if you give them a reason.
R:  Yeah.  But, you know, that also opens it up to all sorts of, well, do you just not like me and that's why you say that there's a reason to test me?
L:  Right.  True.  True also.  Okay.  They have to it with everyone, yeah.   
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  You're right.  You're right.  I guess the reason why they do have this [LAUGH] across the board testing is because there's so many problems that they've had with addicts they've hired.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And didn't know they were addicts, so I guess now they want to know before they hire you.
R:  Yeah.  Or maybe -- I don't know, maybe it hasn't been a problem in the past, but they just want to keep it that way, you know?
L:  True.  Or -- or it could be the fact that they just want to infringe upon your rights now days, 'cause they're trying to knock out all your basic Fifth Amendment -- I mean, basic rights, as it is.
R:  [COUGH].
L:  As far as searching -- searching stuff is concerned.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  They're trying to, you know, knock out a lot of the individual's rights as it is.  Because of the terrorism thing.  
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  You know?  You know, they just taking the step further, probably.  And it is discrimination in some sense.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Because then, you look at people who came from programs and -- and who are doing right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're doing what they have to do, but then they have a little drink and then all of a sudden now they're shunned, or they have to go on a program which --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, which -- like, my building.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They wanna do -- they -- they -- I know it, badly, they want to do testing so bad.
R:  Really?
L:  B- because, okay, I come from a shelter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right?  I didn't come from a program, but a majority of the people here, it being that -- I live in a SRO owned by the city, you know, and to volunteer to America, they deal with people from shelters, like I was telling you, the DAS division A services and um, a lot of cancer patients and stuff like that, but being that so many people are doing their thing in here, I know they want to test real bad in here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and then they hired this substance abuse counselor who's in everybody's business.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, and a lot of times, like okay, they quit searching me.  Now, I had a regular counselor at first.  Then they switched to a substance abuse counselor to me, but I didn't move in here with a substance abuse past.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You understand? 
R:  Right.
L:  So she's trying to go by what she hear, that I been having alcohol parties and you know, this, that and the other.  What she hear and what she -- based on what she think she sees, how I look, well then sometimes how I don't look --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she wants to put down on my record, saying I'm a substance abuser and wants me to sign this every month and every time I see her, she's tried to slip it on me in so many different ways and then she told me, "Yeah, well, um, I changing notice of drug abuser and, you know, we can do testing, we can start testing.  You know, I can put a report to start testing", and I say, "Well, you do what you have to do".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "But as of now, you don't know me to be a substance abuser, and why do you keep trying to get me to sign this paper every month?"
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, uh --
L:  Which will go on my record.
R:  And everybody has a bad day.  I mean, sometimes you look good and sometimes --
L:  Thank you.
R:  -- you look trashy --
L:  Thank you.
R:  -- you know, you have a bad hair day.
L:  Yeah.  So um I -- I -- I had applied for a free grant for a computer, right?
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  And she doesn't know me to be a substance abuser, but I asked her to write me a recommendation letter and you could see where she squeezed in title -- um, it was just counselor there, and you could see where she squeezed in "abuse" and she put "substance" on the top.
R:  Oh.
L:  She would squeeze -- so I'm like, you know what?  You're trying to sabotage me here.
R:  Yeah, totally.
L:  How am I gonna get a free computer from -- from the government if you're gonna put all of this on my recommendation letter?  What was the purpose of you putting "substance abuse counselor?"  You could of just put "counselor".
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, and she doesn't know -- I didn't tell her.  I'm -- I'm not one of the people who came from a program.  I'm not one of the people who has a history of drug use, but based on what she thinks she knows and sees about me, um, she wants me to keep -- you know, she keeps trying to slip this on me and I know what they do.  One girl told them -- she gonna tell me, "Oh well, we can start doing testing".  "Well then, you do what you have to do".
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  But until then, I'm not 'fessing up to nothing that -- that you don't know about.  
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  It's none of your business.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're gonna end up trying to get me put out, is what you're gonna do.  You're gonna take that information, just like a company wouldn't hire me, you're gonna take that information, if I was to sign that, I -- you know, I almost made the mistake of signing because she had other papers covering this paper.
R:  Yeah?
L:  We do a monthly review every month, saying that, um, we have goals to reach.  She keeps putting on one of the papers her goal is to realize her substance abuse and do something about it, and every time I see the paper, she'll be, like, trying to get me to sign it, trying to get me to sign it, but I always read before I sign.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So I signed the first page.  Now, this month she had it on the second page.
R:  Oh.
L:  Okay?  The first time she --
