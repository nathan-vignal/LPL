L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Indra[?]
R:  H- how you doing?
L:  S- --
R:  Name is Jas.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Jasmine.
L:  Jasmine?
R:  Yes.
L:  Your name is Jasmine?
R:  Yes, Jasmine Batise[?]
L:  [NOISE] Oh okay, how are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  So what do you think about high criminal trials?
R:  Oh I don't -- trials is like -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to me, I figure like, the way they be putting people in citizens[?] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to a time and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think they should not, you know -- who was the [several inaudible words] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- why we give them time, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Who what?
R:  How can somebody give somebody the time?  You know, you know it's just -- it -- it just doesn't -- it's amazing how people can give away people time.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You know, actually it's amazing that any man can give another man time.
L:  What do you mean time?  I don't understand.
R:  Okay, I'm saying like [LIPSMACK] -- okay you said the topic is for -- it's like say it again to me -- explain it to me again what you're saying [several inaudible words]?
L:  The topic was -- I guess it was saying, what do you we feel about people, [SIGH] putting like high +profile [NOISE] crimes on television?  I guess like for example, Timothy McVeigh.  [SIGH] How like he blew up [NOISE] the World Trade Centre, how do we feel about that being televised?
R:  Oh, that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay I feel like that happened -- that was -- I think it was -- this is -- it is -- it is in God's hands, you know?
L:  It was what?
R:  It's in God's hands, you know what I'm saying?  It's like that happened --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's -- it's in God's hands, and things happen for a reason, you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know?
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  For me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm just saying, you know?
L:  [NOISE] I agree, [NOISE] and I also feel as though [NOISE] they may- -- they shouldn't have um, told everyone like, what was going on with like how they were [NOISE] gonna execute him, because I know --
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  -- because like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're teaching people not to kill, but then they're gonna execute someone on national television.
R:  Exactly, and that's not -- that -- that's what --
L:  Can you [several inaudible words]?
R:  -- I -- I think that um, they should not um, +execute him just like that --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that's just a -- you know I j- -- think he needs to see a doctor.
L:  [NOISE] Say it again?
R:  I think he should go see a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- +psychiatrist.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think he need to see somebody --
L:  You think --
R:  -- you know?  --
L:  Yeah, I think he --
R:  He need to get hired -- he -- he -- he --
L:  -- he was pretty crazy.
R:  Yeah, don't need to kill him, you know, because he killed people -- something's wrong with the man.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, to even think of something like that.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And it's really cranky, you know?  I would think he needs therapy, you know?
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] I also feel though like, [NOISE] I don't think it's the government's right to say what the [MN] -- what the punishment should be.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, I mean I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- don't think the government has the right to kill someone, [SIGH] and it's like --
R:  I don't think they should.
L:  -- when it's televised, when it's put on national television, the government shows how it abuses its power.
R:  Right, but they -- they shouldn't kill him --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they -- they -- they shouldn't just take a man's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- life like that.  Who should've judged somebody because they killed somebody?  You know -- you know since the doctor locked him up forever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?  Throw away the key.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, let him rot away in -- in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the cell, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  But I wouldn't just go ahead and kill him, because as long as it doesn't make more killings, you know?
L:  Yeah, basically they're teaching that's the way you end problems, by killing.
R:  Yes, exactly and that's not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the way to end it, you know?
L:  Yeah a- -- but that's what they're, [SIGH] -- it's like -- and they wonder why people choose to end lives that way.  [SIGH]
R:  Right, but they -- they shouldn't do that.  I think that's very wrong there.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't think that's very nice to do that, you know?  But we -- we know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what can we say?  You know what I'm saying?  That's the politician --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thing and you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's the way the want to do things, you know?  
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  I dunno we're just, one more in that haystack, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and also like, I also felt like similar when they were handling like Bin Laden, and you know, [NOISE] um [SIGH] just Iraq issues.  I feel like when they -- when they televise it [NOISE] they also --
R:  Right.
L:  -- make it very biased.  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, they make it very biased to the point that [NOISE] they try and get everyone to agree with America, so like there's t- -- there's two problems when they televise it; [NOISE] they make -- they -- they make themselves +contradictory in reference to Timothy McVeigh because they killed someone on national television [NOISE] when they want people to learn you don't end problems by killing, [SIGH] and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they also [SIGH] go after this guy, Bin Laden, and start bombing their [NOISE] country, you know what I mean?
R:  Right, and then they kill innocent people.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?  You know and that --
L:  So it's like I said, like when they televise it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I al- -- but I'm not sure [SIGH] -- I'm not sure if it's -- it's bad because what the younger people are learning [NOISE] but I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's important to do so, so we know exactly what we're doing, but then [NOISE] we have to wonder how much are we really seeing?
R:  Exactly.  But what he's really doing, he's just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- making them -- showing them that -- that ah um, United States is a private example --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he's not making a private example --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out of this man right here, and what we can do to you all over here.
L:  Exactly, they just --
R:  You know?
L:  -- want U- United States to be feared by everyone. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, like they had Russia --
L:  That's the whole point.
R:  Yeah, like they had Russia [several inaudible words] and they said, "We go ahead and um, you know, hit New York" and we said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "We -- we target --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- the same as you target".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "You push a button, we push a button".  You know that -- that's just like fighting, you know this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for what reason?  For money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, for all you g- -- all you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [inaudible] you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And whether -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're trying to keep us ground, keep it coming up in the money and -- and the people and everything, it's -- it's just a whole bunch of mix up.  Everybody wants the money here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?
L:  And it's scary how you'll have money but, [NOISE] it'll never be enough, and that's why you continue to do evil things, because whenever you have money you want [SIGH] more and more and more of it.
R:  Right, it's the root of all evil is the money, you know, and it --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- makes them all crazier, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, like media is definitely -- like the whole televised thing, it's definitely the way a lot of people get a lot of their views on [NOISE] issues. [NOISE] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, that's how it teaches a lot of people -- [NOISE] that's how it teaches racism to children, you know that's how they teach [NOISE] people about things [NOISE] that they don't know of, you know? [NOISE] 
R:  Exactly.  You know they go back a hundred years -- go back it must be three, four centuries back, and they really[?] look at TV, you know, so you look at everything as a money thing here, you know?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they go back in ancient times, they didn't even have no money, I think they were selling rice for bullets and guns --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but like, you know back -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back in the old days, you know?  
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  You know, I -- like -- I watch classic movies, you know, and I watch how far they go back for money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know they start, um -- England's full of the money and Paris --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- full of the money and Indians want this a little bit of money for rice.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "You give us guns, we'll give you rice", and you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- each country got something to sell --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and they're only jeopardizing their own kids' future, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's -- it's --
R:  You know?
L:  -- pretty sad.
R:  Yeah, it really is, and it's gonna go infinitely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- worser.  I say another three more years from now, they're gonna have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- flying Cadillacs in a minute.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  You know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're gonna have flying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cars and they're gonna stop out your window; you can just -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- walk right there.
L:  [NOISE] Because you can't --
R:  [inaudible] definitely.
L:  -- control what America's gonna try and do.  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly, you see them making everything [inaudible] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- today.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, look all these things they got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- look at these computers that you can get into things, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  You know, [MN] well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's like money, more and more, you know?
L:  [NOISE] It's just --
R:  You know that -- [PAUSE] go ahead.
L:  [NOISE] I was just gonna say that, [NOISE] -- oh like, I don't know if I'd want them to change it being televised though, [NOISE] because I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wouldn't be able to know what they were doing.
R:  Right, exactly, you know, and that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it is- -- it is bad that way, the way that -- that -- that -- like I said this country is going down. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and -- and, I'll tell you, the kids -- every little kid --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they want money, every kid I meet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if they want the clothes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they want the money, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's why we have these --
L:  It's okay to want money, but you have to earn it the r- right way, you have to get it the right way.  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  [NOISE] You have to work for it, you have to go to school, you have to work for it.
R:  You gotta get a degree, I mean a bachelor degree, all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these things you have to get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?  To really want money in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your life, you know what I mean?  You're looking at real money here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?  You gotta get -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you gotta get certificates, you gotta --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- start from school, you gotta --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stay -- keep the As coming, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you're gonna have to go to college and things like that.  And you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have to do the right thing in life.  You know that's what we try and tell my nephew --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "You gotta do the right thing", you know?  If you're looking for something good in the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fu- --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] [SIGH] I don't know, [NOISE] but I wonder where they get [NOISE] these topics of conversations from.  [PAUSE] [NOISE]  I'm wondering -- hello?  [NOISE] Hello? [NOISE] Hello? [NOISE]  Hello? [NOISE]
