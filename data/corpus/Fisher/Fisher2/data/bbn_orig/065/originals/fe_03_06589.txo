R:  Hi, my name's Bob Franklin.  I'm from Marshleigh[?], Missouri.
L:  Hi, Bob.  This is Robyn from Los Angeles.  How are you?
R:  Not bad, thanks.  And you?
L:  [MN]  How's the weather there?
R:  It's -- it was a beautiful day today.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What's the time difference from Los Angeles to Missouri?
R:  Um, it's nine thirty right now.
L:  Oh, really?  That's [inaudible].
R:  I think it's [MN] two hours?
L:  Yeah, it's seven thirty right here.
R:  Uh-huh.  Great.
L:  So ...  What's our topic for today?  Divorce.
R:  Family -- yeah, divorce.
L:  Family values and -- let's see and the question is the divorce -- has the divorce rate altered our behaviour?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You go first.
R:  Okay.  Um ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or I will if you don't have --
R:  No that's --
L:  -- anything to say.
R:  No, that's fine.  Um, I actually have some -- some personal experience with, uh, with divorce, [MN] -- well, not my -- me personally but my -- my parents were divorced.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  And, um, then they ended up getting remarried, like, five years later, which was kind of cool.  I --
L:  Wow.
R:  I -- yeah, it was -- it ended up being a good senior, uh, senior present.  'Cause it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was my senior year and -- and I enjoyed that but, um, as far as my views on it, I -- I think, that for the most part, I -- I -- I kinda am, +like, old school.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Um, I- I'm like -- like a dog, you now.  Very loyal.  
L:  Yes.
R:  And when I -- when I take a mate, you know, it's for life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't know about, um -- well, I do actually because I'm in the navy and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I see a lot of people that th- they treat marriage not as an institution but rather --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just a -- a --
L:  A convenience?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  I know what you mean.  
R:  And it -- it kind of sickens me a little bit 'cause [MN], you know, I -- I don't even know what the actual divorce rate is in the United States but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I -- I know it's -- it's skyrocketed since, even, the seventies.
L:  It has.  I -- and the divorce rate has not altered my behaviour because I don't really have erratic behaviour as far as relationships go.  I like --
R:  Are you --
L:  -- to sew.  I'm very loyal.
R:  Are you married?
L:  I am.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  For ten years and I would never look at another man.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean p- -- because I don't [LAUGH] -- my husband and I are self contained.  It might sound strange --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I don't have -- I don't have to look outside of my relationship to fulfill myself because I have everything right here.
R:  Right.  Right.  [MN]
L:  And if we came to a point where we disagreed on marriage then I think it would be amicable.
R:  Mm.
L:  And we'd just go our separate ways and start a new relationship.  But I think people just misuse marriage altogether.
R:  I do too.
L:  Especially celebrities.  I mean, how many times has Liz Taylor been married?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That makes you wonder.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.
L:  Is she having a problem or do the men have a problem with her as a celebrity?
R:  Right.
L:  It's just very odd that people don't really have any values.  I -- I strongly believe in -- you know, I don't even want to say family values because that has a negative connotation.  Yet again it is family values --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you have to be true to yourself and your partner and everything.  
R:  Right.  I think a lot of people, uh, u- use -- used to be this way.  A lot of people would stay married for the children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just [MN] they would be unhappy.
L:  Yeah,
R:  But -- but they'd say, "All right, well, we'll -- we'll tough it out for the kids".  You know.
L:  Mhm
R:  But, um, [MN] I think that [MN] -- I don't -- I don't know if that's -- if that's a -- a healthy attitude to take towards it.
L:  I agree.  I think the divorce rate is conducive to temptation and selfishness.  People want to be able to have everything that they want --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So even if they are married they're not afraid to go outside their marriage.
R:  Right.
L:  And do what they feel is right which, you know, it is -- it is the ultimate selfishness I feel.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And if you don't take your vows seriously, of course, it's always going to repeat itself.  History will always repeat itself.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  But we can stop the divorce rate if we just look within ourselves and say, "Well do I really want that other person?  Are they really going to make me happy?"  We have to make ourselves happy before we can --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- make someone else happy, I feel.
R:  Yeah, but then how does that -- how does that whole divorce rate issue tie in with, say, religion?  See where that starts playing into it too.
L:  Mm.  I don't know.  I don't know.
R:  It might --
L:  Do you think they're related?
R:  Well, I don't know.  [MN]  It might be interesting to -- to find out if there's a connection with -- with different religious sects and the actual divorce rate among the different, uh, religions.  You know what I'm saying?  Like --
L:  That's true.
R:  Like Catholics --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are -- are together seventy five percent more than, say, Baptists and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just, you know, find out from that aspect.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It might be an interesting ...
L:  That might be interesting take on the whole thing.  I mean, do you believe people should live together or do you think they should just get married?
R:  Well, that's -- I -- I -- I believe in --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the institution of marriage and I think that it -- [SIGH] hm ...  No.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't think they should live together.  I think if --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they're gonna make a go of it then they should get married.
L:  It's the old adage.  Why buy the cow when the milk is free?
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I -- you know, I never --
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I've heard that but it'd been years and years.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You may be --
L:  I know --
R:  -- dating yourself there.
L:  [LAUGH]  But I've heard it for, you know, quite a long time.  I mean, I'm a writer so I -- I hear these things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- all the time anyway.  It's true.  [MN]  If you're gonna [SIGH] have free milk why buy milk?
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  Uh, people just don't take it serious enough.  I think because they are looking at celebrities and other people and they think, well I want what Liz Taylor has.  I want to get married --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- eight times.  But she --
R:  Right.
L:  -- did get married eight times but it just didn't work out.
R:  Has it been eight times?
L:  I believe the last time was the eighth time with Larry -- with the other -- the construction guy.
R:  Oh.
L:  That just makes me wonder what -- [LAUGH] I mean how can she not get it right after eight times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe she's just picking the wrong partners.
R:  Yeah.  That could be.  Now do you -- now see I -- I make conscious efforts to do things with my family.
L:  Yes.
R:  And -- and, you know, like -- like, we'll -- 'cause I don't -- I don't s- -- I don't get to spend much time with them as it is.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I -- I'm, like, out to sea all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, when I come back it's like, okay, well -- it's -- it's -- it's almost like having a -- a new girlfriend everytime but, you know, it's the same familiar faces.  But then --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [MN], you know, my children are always happy to see me.  And it's --
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's -- it's great, actually.  So [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I'll take 'em out golfing or, um, fishing or something like that and it's --
L:  [MN]  Mhm.
R:  I -- I think that -- I think if more people did more quality activities.  It's quality --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- time, not quantity.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that, uh, that we might see a, uh, decrease in the divorce ratio.
L:  Because it is very tough, I mean, if you have to go to sea and leave your family.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I ima- -- I can imagine what they must be going through.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And if your wife were a weaker person she might think, "Well, my husband's going to be gone for six months.  I'm really lonely.  Let me just go out with the mailman for now".  
R:  Oh, I know.  
L:  That's --
R:  I know.
L:  -- terrible.  
R:  I --
L:  But ...
R:  You know, I don't --
L:  -- people do it.
R:  -- even worry about that anymore.  Though, really --
L:  Oh, good, good.
R:  I mean I just --
L:  I mean, you can't.  It'd just drive you crazy. 
R:  I've got to see my family a total of f- -- three months in the last two years.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  That's sad.
R:  Yeah, it was -- it's been ha- it's been hard.
L:  I can imagine.  That -- that's tough.  How long are you going to be in the navy?  Is it a lifetime commitment?
R:  Oh, I have -- I have three and a half years to go until I can retire.
L:  Wow.  Well, that's not too bad.
R:  No.  No.  But --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- only a -- only a year and a half more at sea. 
L:  Oh, that's good. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you ever get seasick?  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  My -- my first time out I did.  
L:  Because of the motion, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  
R:  Plus [MN] -- 
L:  I haven't had --
R:  Well, plus I had a big [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I see.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Haven't had that experience yet?  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, yeah, it was -- it was not something I relished.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, is the divorce rate in the military higher than anywhere else, do you know?
R:  I think it is.  I really do.
L:  It is?  Hm.
R:  Um, [MN] -- easily -- easily thirty, thirty five, forty percent of military people get divorced --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- within [MN] -- during their first, um, tour of duty.
L:  Oh, that's tough.  I know in the police -- police indu- -- um, policemen, they have a very high divorce rate.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's --
L:  Because the -- the wife is never sure if the poli- -- if their husband is coming home, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they just give -- bail out.
R:  I'm sure that --
L:  Which is --
R:  -- that would weigh on them.
L:  It's almost the same being married to a military person.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I would say.  'Cause you have to go away on missions and then -- I'm sure in the back of the wife's mind they're wondering, "Am I going to see him again".  So, of course, that would make the time you spent together more quality because --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it may be the last time
