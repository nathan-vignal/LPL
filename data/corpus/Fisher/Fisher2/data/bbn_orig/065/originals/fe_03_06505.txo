L:  Hello?
R:  Nicole.
L:  Hi, I'm Dayna.
R:  What is it, I'm sorry?
L:  Dayna.
R:  Dayna, oh okay. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, I guess it's about trials; have you ever watched a trial, on TV?
R:  Yes, I have, yes --
L:  Have you?
R:  -- I have.  Yes, I have.  I've -- I've seen the Ray Carruth trial.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yes. [NOISE] 
L:  And um, so do you feel like they should be televised, or ?
R:  Hm, [SIGH] no, actually I don't.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I actually don't, because it -- it -- the more that we see all this stuff, we start to form these judgements about people and it's -- it's kinda unfair, it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- really is.  You know, what if this person is totally innocent, but in the public opinion they're guilty?  They can't live normally after [NOISE] it's over.  [SIGH] But in this particular case he was guilty.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I've never watched one, but um, I'm not quite sure how I feel about it either.  I probably think you had a good point that, regardless of the outcome, the public has usually formed a judgement and so, even found innocent, they're not gonna be able to live as if they're innocent --
R:  Right --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- and that whole thing to me is -- is -- [LAUGH] it was no -- it's -- it's no -- it was no privacy for the family, it was reporters everywhere; it's a madhouse, I think it's a circus.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's -- it's just very unfair for both families involved, it w- --
L:  Yeah that's true.  Yeah and --
R:  -- it really is.  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um did you -- did you get a chance to see, um, any of the OJ Simpson trial?
L:  [SIGH] Not really, not -- I didn't really watch the trial, I end up watching the reports afterwards, you know --
R:  Even that, you know --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- that whole ar- -- the -- the cases I -- the cases I had a chance to view, they were all a circus.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I, you know [NOISE] even with this Court TV, 'cause I have Court TV so I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I get a chance to look at it, is too much.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Too much.
L:  So, um  and I don't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think that I think it serves any purpose.  I guess the only thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I think is -- a lot of times I think that the media would taint -- like I didn't get to watch OJ Simpson trial --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, straight, so what I got I think sometimes was a tainted version of what the media showed.  But regardless of that, it didn't really matter, you know what I mean?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There wasn't really a purpose for me to see the trial itself.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, so [LIPSMACK] -- so I guess I don't really see any purpose --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in having it, and um, I do think that I would be the type, regardless of whether you think it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- should be or not, that once I started watching it, I would want to watch it all the time --
R:  And that's --
L:  -- you know? [LAUGH]
R:  -- exactly what happens, yeah. 
L:  So --
R:  That's what happened to me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so I can see myself where I would do that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, I'd want [NOISE] to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- keep up on it, and that kind of stuff and you'd get kind -- I guess kind of like a soap opera almost --
R:  Right, and -- and -- and --
L:  -- except you know, this is true.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  So I g- -- like I said, so I can see myself doing it, and then probably thinking, "Why did I do this?" [LAUGH] "There's no good reason to be --" 
R:  You -- yes [LAUGH] --
L:  "-- doing this".  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what happened with me with the Ray Carruth trial; I turned it on one day and I just kept watching and kept watching, I just couldn't stop.  [SIGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  It becomes kinda addictive.
L:  Yes, so I can see myself doing that, you know, and um, [SIGH] so I guess I don't really see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a reason for it.  Well, and -- and I started to say, I grew up in Oklahoma City, so I thought, "Well maybe I can understand like in the trial of Timothy McVeigh, [SIGH] --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- where maybe the family would want to see it", but they made arrangements that re- -- because they took the trial out of state --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so a lot of families couldn't attend, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they had a private viewing just for the families of those victims.  So I can understand something like that --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they chose to want to see it, but it was in Denver, and so they can't, you know, take off months and months to go see this trial --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I can maybe see that, but that wasn't televised to the public.
R:  Yeah it's -- it's --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So um -- so I dunno.  And um, I'm not really sure h- -- I don't know, how long have they been doing that, do you have any idea?
R:  I'm not sure, like I d- -- I wasn't really aware of this until I got cable and -- and got hooked up with Court TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So um, but I'm thinking, growing up --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I don't think they ever did anything like that, so I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- know when we decided that was a good thing, or 
R:  That it was okay, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so -- and then I don't know what considers -- I mean what's high -- high profile enough that you make it onto the -- you know, to make it onto the televised TV and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't have cable so I don't know; do they --
R: [SIGH]
L:  -- I mean are they always really big trials, or ?
R:  Mm yes, like the Danielle Van Dam trial, that was the one --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I hadn't -- yeah I had to pull myself from watching that --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, maybe I'm glad I don't have cable now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I would be the same way.
R:  Right, yeah you know, and it's -- it was all day long with the -- you don't wanna -- because they're not -- they don't really show commercials so you --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- kinda wanna sit there and look at it, [SIGH] and I've found I --
L:  I mean sometimes I get stuck on [NOISE] Judge Judy, so I can [LAUGH] imagine --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what I'd be on a good trial.
R:  Well, you know, it makes me kinda nosey into other people's lives --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's why I don't think it should be broadcast --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, you know, mm huh.
L:  Yeah, and um, 'cause that's what I was trying to -- like I say, not having seen that stuff that I'm not really sure, but um I guess I don't see any advantage to it, and why people feel like they have a right to that.  'Cause I guess -- I mean if you feel that strongly, you can -- the trials are usually open to the public.  
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  So you can go and watch it yourself, if you want, you know, if it's that --
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
L:  -- important to you.
R:  [SIGH] You know when I realized there's something about this that's not right, so I kinda got away from Court TV 'cause I --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I found myself judging people.  I said, "I don't even know these people".
L:  Yeah really, and that's what --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] "I don't like you either" you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  You're a pr- -- you know I -- and I just got caught up in it, so I had to stop.
L:  [SIGH] 'Cause I know even, I had to do jury duty not too long ago, and um -- and I remember they were asking you -- it was -- for me it was hard 'cause they were like, "Well, have you -- do you feel like you've already made up your mind?"  Well, was this person's fourth offence for DWI so there's a part of me that was like, "Yes".  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's like. "This is his fourth time, [LAUGH] what do you think?" you know? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But there was a part of me that was already getting this little adrenaline flow [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- from being on jury duty, and ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- luckily I didn't get picked, they're probably glad. [LAUGH] You know, it's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- one person off of being picked, [SIGH] and --
R:  [SIGH] And that's --
L:  -- so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But um -- but I know even like that, it was like, "Wow, this is like being at a real trial, I've never been at a real trial" you know?
R:  [MN]
L:  And I did a, um -- sometimes for extra money I do these mock jury things and you --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and they present this case and you pretend like you're the jury and stuff like that, [SIGH] so I always have enjoyed that kind of stuff, you know, and um, so like I said -- and sometimes I think when it's on TV, it's easy to forget that it's real people.  
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, it almost seems like just as- -- a, [NOISE] you know, weekly TV series or something.  
R:  Right, and the, you know --
L:  [SIGH] But --
R:  -- um -- uh -- I felt so bad because I started calling people names and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, and it's like I don't even know them.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, and it just -- you -- it just -- it ma- -- it changed my whole attitude about a lot of things and that's when I realized I had to stop.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] Yes, and um  and I don't know, I do think -- 'cause I do- -- I wrote to an inmate for a while, I got hooked up with an organization that would pr- -- ah, give you an address of an inmate who didn't usually have family visit and stuff like that, and so that was even kinda different, because all of a sudden it is a person and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know about 'em and you know, that kinda stuff and so, I thought, "Now, how would I feel if it turned out to be somebody I'd watched the trial on TV?" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  I was already having a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hard time, 'cause I -- you know my first letter wanted to be, "And why are you in?"  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] You're like, "What did you do?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, and so it's like, "Oh, that's not really the purpose" and he later did tell me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- why he was in, and stuff like that, but um, so I thought, "Well, what if that ended up being somebody that you'd watched his trial and you'd already decided" you know, and that kinda stuff, and um   So like I said, I'm not sure that I see any advantage to it and I see a lot of disadvantages to it.  But I think one of the reasons that they do it is because people watch it; you know, I mean I think it's ratings as much as anything.
R:  It [LAUGH] --
L:  And [LAUGH] so, unfortunately I think sometimes that drives a lot of TV stuff --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know or, things --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- like that.  So um, like I said I don't -- I can't remember [SIGH] at what point, how many years ago did they decide to start doing this and -- and I kinda wonder what was the advantage of doing it to begin with; why they felt, you know, that was a good thing?  Although I guess sometimes people feel like that maybe something goes on.
R:  That we're gonna miss something, that the reporter's not gonna tell us the truth --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- I don't -- you know it's --
L:  Or maybe --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- behind the scenes --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the case, you know the -- the lawyer doesn't do his best job or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know or there's something fishy --
R:  [SIGH] Or the -- you know the --
L:  -- about this trial or 
R:  -- or the witness was improperly -- you know things --
L:  Yes, yeah --
R:  -- like these.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, I guess they'd be -- it's like the -- the public feel like they have a right to make their own judgements, not this view of, you know, what somebody else is telling you happened, you know?
R:  You know it's already twelve [NOISE] people selected to judge, why are we watching? [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, so that we can judge too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And sometimes that, I mean if you don't agree sometimes I thought it's str- --
