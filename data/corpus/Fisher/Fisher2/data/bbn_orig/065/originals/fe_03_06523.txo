R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] My name --
R:  Um --
L:  -- is Bethany.
R:  -- my name's Holly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  This is the first one of these I've done so ...
L:  Yeah.  Me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about job testing.
L:  Yes.  Um, just if we feel it's a [several inaudible words] or something.
R:  Yeah.  I guess that's what -- are they talking about drug testing?  Or just regular testing, testing?
L:  I think they're talking about, like, for jobs I guess, if, like, people, you know how on some job applications [NOISE] or something it says, [MN] you know, we have the right to do drug tests or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that's what they're talking about, like, that kinda [NOISE] -- so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Um, hm, [LIPSMACK] well what do you think?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I don't have [LAUGH] very strong feelings on it.  Um, [NOISE] I, uh, [NOISE] I guess -- [NOISE] 
R:  I don't either.
L:  -- like, even if it's, you know, one of those jobs that, like, a place in the mall or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe, like, if they hired mostly teenagers or something; they just wanted to make sure that they weren't hiring, like, [LAUGH] people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- who are, like, you know, [MN] like, need to do that.  But, I mean, it's just, like, you know, some other place, like, that you need any sort of degree or something, I think that's a little, I don't know --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- too [inaudible] 
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know what you mean.  I mean, I can see, [LIPSMACK] well, I mean, I guess --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I can understand why employers would want to drug test their employees --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- especially for, like, people that are flying --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- planes and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, driving a bus --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and stuff like that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know Walmart does but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and that s something that they, like, use to kinda make people think they're a better company.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm like you, I don't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really have, like, really strong feelings about it either.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I don't -- I don't have a problem with it 'cause I don't do drugs.  So, they could -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- drug test [LAUGH] me all day if they wanted to and, you know --
R:  Exactly.  Me too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] me, I mean, it's not going to make any difference.  I think, like -- and they use it largely as a -- like a deterrent, you know, so --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, you know, people I guess are kinda scarred.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But here really if -- even if they did drugs [several inaudible words] work.  I don't think that --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] it has any impact. 
R:  Right.
L:  It means it's going to affect their, uh -- uh, their performance I guess.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but [NOISE] --
R:  You know --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- I know what you mean.  Um, and I'm looking for a job right now actually and I guess --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, it's just thinking how I would feel if somebody said, "Okay, well you have to have a drug test".  Well, I mean, I wouldn't care 'cause like you, I don't do drugs either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, um, [SIGH] gosh, I don't know, I mean, I guess it would be kinda weird in a way but I wouldn't, I mean I would do it, you know,
L:  Yeah.  Well, like, I've had to take 'em before, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, they wouldn't even let you have, like, an interview, like, they look at your application, but they wouldn't give you, like, a full interview until you took the drug test.  Because, like, if you failed it there is no point.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, I, like, I -- I think that again, like, a little excessive almost because it's not -- it has nothing to do with your job.  Like, if you're doing something that's going to affect other people --
R:  Right
L:  -- like, that's one thing, but, you know, when you're working for, like, some retail company, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what difference does it make.  Like, not necessarily condoning, uh, drug [LAUGH] usage, but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to see I'm not -- not making -- is this a big deal [several inaudible words] target and, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all pieces like that.
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] blood test.  But, I mean, you're running a register.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  Most people are already, you know, I mean, if you don't show up like, you know, marijuana's going to show up or something doesn't make people particularly violent.  So, it doesn't make any --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LAUGH] any difference. 
R:  I wonder if -- if companies see it as, like, if you're positive on a drug test and you're doing drugs, that maybe they think you're more likely to steal money.
L:  That could be it too.  I didn't think about that.  [NOISE] I guess I --
R:  That's what I was thinking while you were talking.  I was thinking well, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like a lot of people think if you're smoking pot --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that you're doing all kins- uh, kinds of other drugs and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then, you know, then you get addicted and you -- you have to have 'em and you don't have any money, and you're going to steal from your employer or something.
L:  Yeah.  I never even thought about that.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I guess that could be it too.
R:  Like -- 
L:  I mean, it -- 
R:  -- maybe it is a higher risk.  I don't know.  
L:  -- I mean, it -- it makes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sense but [MN] I mean, like, the point is they're hiring the primarily sixteen year olds and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- y- -- I don't think that the chance of that is that high.  Like, for any reasoning with the, you know, there is still money, um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- whatever [LAUGH] like, maybe -- a little lazy or something [inaudible] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a little lazy or something [LAUGH] but -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, they're catching this --
R:  I know.  I agree with you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  And I think, you know, if you're sixteen, like, that's the age that you're probably gonna --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- be trying stuff like that, you know.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Like, it -- when you get in your thirties, you really don't do it.  But when you're sixteen --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you might try it.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause everybody else does.  Or whatever, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I don't know, I hadn't really -- like I said, I haven't [several inaudible words] to it.  And I don't have, like, really strong [LAUGH] views on it.  
R:  Yeah.  I don't either.  I really don't either.
L:  No.  I -- I don't know, um --
R:  Some people are really, like, they feel like it's such an invasion of privacy and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I [MN] --
L:  I mean, it's one thing --
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  -- if you know, like, you were just walk around one day and you seem kinda tired and they, you know, pin you down and give you a drug test.  Like they used to do that when I was in high school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you, like, there was a big issue with that.  They would actually -- if people looked tired in school they would take them out of class and try to give 'em --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- drug tests.  And that was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a big issue.  Because they -- they said, "You know, the drugs make you tired", or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is just ridiculous because, you know, we're at school at, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- quarter to seven in the morning [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't know why they would expect anybody to be all, like, bright eyed, but ... 
R:  Yeah.   Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's a little bit extreme I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just like randomly, oh, you look --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- especially tired today so [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we -- we think you're doing drugs.
L:  Yeah.  And I mean --
R:  That's, yeah --
L:  -- they would go way overboard with that stuff.  And then it -- I don't know if it's ever been that bad with, like, jobs before but if that was the case; if they were just taking it upon themselves to, you know, determine new things and then hold it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- against you, I think that has gone a little far.
R:  Yeah.  I would have to agree.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Aside from that really, I don't [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  I think -- I'm just trying to remember.  It seems like I knew somebody at one point who, um, [LIPSMACK] was working someplace where they did random testing, like, every so often they would just say --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- okay, you know, they'd do a drug test.  And then they would test I guess they would pick randomly from those people that were tested and, you know, to check for drugs and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they never knew at -- at any point they could just be tested --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  I don't know, that's kinda weird.  I don't know if I'd wanna work somewhere that did it constantly.  It would just be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they're not th- -- because I'd do anything, but just because it seems like; it's like [SIGH] we really don't trust you, you know.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Like, I don't know why you'd hire people if you thought [LAUGH] like --
R:  Yeah.  And like --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- testing when you get hired isn't enough.  We're going to keep testing you to make sure --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  I guess it also depends too, like, I don't know, I'm assuming the company pays for it.  But if they didn't, drug testing isn't that cheap from what I understand.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, I had to have a drug test done once and they told me that it was expensive.  They didn't tell me, like, how much it was.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it was at their expense.  But I mean if it --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- wasn't that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's kinda wrong.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I think that they -- they pay for it for the most part.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I haven't heard of -- 
L:  I was wondering if maybe it's like, you know, nobody's supposed to do drugs, and, like, they're supposed to keep teenagers off the streets and this and that.  And I guess it's some sort of, like -- and it's also for the company but it is -- it's like another way to, um, like, keep people away from it through jobs, like, you know, a lot of sixteen year olds and stuff have jobs like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's just, like, kinda of a g- governmental thing, [LAUGH] like, you know --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- they try to keep people away from it.
R:  Probably.
L:  Which sounds sorta like the creepy, like, you know, big brother thing.  But ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know. 
R:  Yeah.  That could be part of it too.  Especially --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- with, like, some of the people with extreme -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- sort of attitudes out there.
L:  Mhm.  Um, I don't know how we can escape something like that [LAUGH] though really.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  If that was the case, I mean, I'm not, uh, I don't know much about stuff like that; their policies, but --
R:  Yeah.  I don't either.
L:  -- um, I suppose I could [several inaudible words] --
R:  But it wouldn't surprise me.
L:  'Cause I mean, really I can't imagine seeing, like, you know, how some places hire, like, older people too.  Like, they have, like, you know, some old lady --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, I can't imagine them just, like, calling her aside, you know, my, "Come here, we're going to drug test you", 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know [LAUGH] [inaudible] 
R:  Right.
L:  What is the chances of that?
R:  Like, McDonalds where they have the -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- retirees all go there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- can you imagine, like, this poor old lady.  So --
R:  Oh, my Gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] Like, you know, I think maybe it's -- it's kind of something like that too.  Like, just another way of keeping people away from stuff.  'Cause, like, you know, they want to keep their job --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because, you know, other applications say, like, you know, the reason why you left or something, and nobody's going to want to have to say, like, I [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I got fired 'cause I'm a --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- drug addict --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Um -- 
R:  That's true --
