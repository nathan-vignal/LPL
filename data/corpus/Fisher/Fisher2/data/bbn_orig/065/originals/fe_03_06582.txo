L:  Hi this is Felicia[?].
R:  Hi I'm Elaine.
L:  Elaine.
R:  Um, I guess my view on -- on the topic is, um, because the divorce rate is so high, um, I guess one out of two marriages, um, I think I work harder at my marriage to make sure that I'm not going to be one of those, one out of two breaking up.
L:  Right and I'm sorry, I'm on the highway so I had to pull over and I didn't really hear what the topic -- the question was.  So I know the family -- what -- okay help me out.
R:  She said it was, um, family values do you feel that with, um, the what did she say the divorce rate, um, what are you doing to, um, -- how do you feel about that, um, cause as far as your family values go with the divorce rate what are you doing about that and I was saying like with like my marriage you know because the divorce rate is so high I think you really do have to work at your marriage even harder to make sure that you're not one of those two couples who does get divorced.
L:  Right okay well me and my kids daddy did get a divorce so -- but what we do I mean we still -- still a family I mean but you know the kids know that they spend time with mum and they've got to spend time with daddy.
R:  Mhm, make sure that they get to, um, still grow up with their father.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  And you have to you know, um, used to have to work with them to make sure that it works out for both of you and make it work for the kids cause that's what's most important in the end.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.
L:  But then on the other hand if it's not a healthy relationship I don't think that the parents ought to stay together because of the kids cause that's putting a you know a bad influence on the kids you know.
R:  Yeah I definitely agree if it's not healthy for the parents it's not going to be healthy for it children.
L:  Cause all it's doing is passing it down generation to generation.
R:  Right I agree -- I agree cause my husband's, um, parents are divorced and they've been divorced since he was five so they have been divorced pretty much all of his life and, um, you know I mean that's -- you know whole different generation but, um, you know I think in his kind of views on that too are you know obviously his parents -- his parents were really young when they got married and you know he was kind of born nine months later and, um, you know they realised that it wasn't right so they didn't stay together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I'm sure he's --
L:  That's the way we were too I mean we grew apart and then the abuse came in and I was like, "No I don't want my kids to see this because you know they get -- what they are going to think it's okay to -- well mama stayed with it she did what she had to do" -- no -- no.
R:  Right.
L:  I'd rather them see me struggling by myself and make ends meet than you know getting my head knocked in or bad words cussing you know.
R:  Right.  Cause you have to show self respect, um, show them yourself respect so that they can do the same for themselves.
L:  Right.
R:  Makes you a stronger person --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And -- and that's really kind of wonderful to hear.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know that you were able to do that for yourself and -- and show that to your kids that you can get out of that and become a better person for it and what's nice is that your relationship changed with your ex-husband too.
L:  Yep.
R:  If you say you're getting along better now.
L:  Much better -- much better.
R:  Well that's good and that's really important for your kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To see.
R:  So do you guys just kind of do the every other weekend?
L:  Every other weekend and now he has them for the summer and then I get them every other weekend.
R:  Oh, okay so they kind of how -- how do you feel about that flipflopping?
L:  I love it -- I love it but the thing of it is we're in the same state we're probably like an hour and a half apart on drive distance and we meet half way to drop them off which is cool, my thing is that I want to move to California -- I'm in Oklahoma -- I want to move California, September.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know how he's going to handle that I haven't talked to him yet.  I'm kind of waiting to do a shock.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cause I mean we might have to go back to court and I don't want to go through all of that again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cause he wants full custody of them but I'm not going to give up my kids.
R:  No -- no definitely not -- how old are your children?
L:  Five and thirteen.
R:  And mine are almost -- well they'll be next month both of them eight and -- and five.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So and your thirteen year old is in high school?
L:  No she's -- she should have been in the seventh grade.
R:  Oh, seventh grade okay.
L:  She -- she likes to play around and that and then her -- she -- I have an older one that's not with their daddy but she's my middle child she's having so much problems we had to see the psychiatrist.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I kind of think it did really effect her more because she was daddy's baby and --
R:  And she was with you for the longest time.
L:  Yeah and then the son came along and -- and he's daddy's favorite so she's suffering more but that's why I have got to keep working on him we have got to get him to the psychiatrist because he has the insurance on [inaudible] but other than that it's going good.
R:  Well good.  Hopefully you can get that worked out.
L:  Yeah so are your girls -- boys?
R:  I have an older son and then a younger daughter and they're, um, well my daughter just finished preschool, she's set up for kindergarten in the fall and my son is in second grade going to third grade so and they've been fighting like cats ask dogs all day.  [LAUGH]
L:  And see I do get my rest in the summer -- I do like them going to daddy.  [LAUGH]
R:  That is nice.
L:  It is -- I'm just left with my sixteen year old and I'm trying to find her a summer job because I'm like [inaudible]
R:  Right and I think that's important because I -- I when I was you know old enough to work I went to work too because if that there is something I wanted my parents, um, they weren't rich or you know just like you want something you know you have got to work for it.
L:  And that's okay because most of her friends like they already got cars.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  "Mama!" I'm like, "Baby no, when I see you get a job you can pay for your own insurance".
R:  Because yeah that's -- yeah and see I think that's you know that teaches them you know the values too I mean you just can't get everything handed to you not everybody can do that.
L:  Right.
R:  And that helps to make you more of an independent person.
L:  It truly does.
R:  So what kind of work do you think she's going to want to do like --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Store?
L:  Do fast food.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah I don't think -- yeah that's what I did, I worked at McDonalds.  [LAUGH]
L:  Dad never had to work fast food but she doesn't want to do it and I'm like, "If that's the only thing you can do that's what you've got to take".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Beggars cannot be choosers.
R:  Right and you know what --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I mean I was just going to say even if you just started at McDonalds you just work there six months or a year just to get some experience just to have something to put down on your resume --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and handle responsible you know is making money and you know it's easier for someone else to hire her once she's kind of proven herself.
L:  Right -- right cause right now I mean being it's -- it's hard trying to find a job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then with the economy down too that's even harder.
R:  Yeah and even you know all of the people that you know that got laid off and, um, you know it's tough finding another job that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sometimes --
L:  Major companies just going down and --
R:  And -- and that's scary in this economy because you're always thinking you know if you have a house or you have an apartment, bills to pay there's responsibilities.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know that's can affect you before you know it and hopefully not but -- so -- well I hope that she finds something that she'll enjoy.
L:  Well I hope so too but if not she's going to get shipped out because I mean with being sixteen left at home while I'm at work it doesn't work.
R:  Yeah it's -- it's almost kind of an easy environment to get into trouble.
L:  Yeah -- oh, yeah and I have a wonderful neighbor across the street that will tell me if anybody stopped in my house while I'm not home but of course he works in the day time and I'm you know she'll be there unattended and I'm like I can't -- I can't -- like I tell her, "You play around you get caught there is no more cheerleading, no more nothing because there is no such thing as an abortion" -- "Mum I don't do that -- I don't do that, that's nasty" -- I say, "Well you better keep that in mind that's very nasty".
R:  Right -- right.
L:  But you know how boys are at that age they'll talk you into anything.
R:  You know that's funny you should mention that I was just watching the Ricki Lake show the other day and they had girls -- some girls on that were you know thirteen fourteen they were interested in becoming mums.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they were other teenagers -- teenagers who were already mums with one to two children.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Was just saying how hard it was just trying to kind of talk them it into like, "I made that mistake once or twice and it's really hard because you can't finish high school because you have got to work to buy diapers you know hopefully you have some family to support you".
