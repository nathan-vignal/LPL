L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Laura. 
L:  Hi, my name's Tina.
R:  Hi, Tina. 
L:  I am in California. 
R:  I am too. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay, hey. [LAUGH] 
R:  How are ya?
L:  I am doing good.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what do you think about random drug testing?
R:  I'm all for it. 
L:  Me too. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- if you expect to, ah -- company to pay you and perform, you know, I guess in a sense they, you know, people make a lot of money to do certain jobs and I think that if, [inaudible] responsibility comes along with that.
R:  Well, I -- and I also think drugs in the wor- -- yeah, drugs is -- the workplace is no place for drugs. 
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  You know [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and if someone can't k- -- you know, at least be drug free when they're, you know, applying for their position --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- [LAUGH] then I don't think they should get the job. [NOISE]
L:  Exactly and I don't think it's an invasion of privacy at all. 
R:  I don't either and I think in -- if anyone thinks it's an invasion of privacy, they can turn down the drug test and --
L:  Exactly --
R:  -- turn down the job.
L:  -- and turn down the job. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly, no, I very much agree with that. 
R:  [NOISE] No, I've worked --
L:  I very --
R:  -- for several companies that have had, um, drug testing and I'm all for it. 
L:  [NOISE] Yes, me too.  I think that it's [NOISE] a great idea --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think a company has [NOISE] to protect [NOISE] itself and if they have employees who are using drugs they may -- may not make good decisions at work, [NOISE] it may cost the company money, [NOISE] you know, and the company --
R:  It could -- it could hurt other employees as well. 
L:  Exactly. 
R:  So, no, I'm all for it.  I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, I kinda, like, think they should have drug testing in schools too, myself. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think they -- and I also think they should drug test welfare. 
R:  Oh, that would be a great idea.  I hadn't thought of it, but that would make a lot of sense. 
L:  It -- to me it just seems as if, you know, we're paying for, [NOISE] you know, helping you guys out [inaudible], then you guys should not be spending that money on drugs. 
R:  That -- boy, that's a great -- that's a great thought. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I had not thought of that before.  But boy, that would be good. 
L:  Yes. [NOISE] I'm definitely all for drug testing because I think there's a level, you know, like I said, a responsibility --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- goes along with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with everything.
R:  Uh-huh.  Pardon me, I have my -- a three year old on my lap. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's okay, I have a four year old and a two year old that just went to bed a little while ago. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Oh, what -- now, what part of California are you in?
L:  Ah, Southern California. 
R:  Ah -- L.A.?
L:  Actually, Camp Pendleton.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my sister's down that way.  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm in Palfredes[?] actually. 
L:  Oh, okay, I grew up in, like, Huntington Beach.
R:  [NOISE] Okay. 
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, I know, my -- my sister [NOISE] is in Callaway[?] [NOISE]. 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  But my, ah, sis- -- my brother in law worked in Camp Pendleton for many years. 
L:  Okay, sh, my husband is a marine. 
R:  Oh, boy.  Did --
L:  So, yes.
R:  -- he have to go overseas?
L:  Yes.  In fact he is coming home Tuesday.
R:  Oh, how exciting. 
L:  Yes, I'm very, very excited.
R:  Congratulations. 
L:  Thank you. 
R:  Wow, how long has he been gone?
L:  Since January.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my, that's a long time. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I bet your kids really miss him. 
L:  They do.  Very much so.  
R:  Well, how --
L:  And that's the thing with --
R:  -- exciting that he's coming home. 
L:  -- exactly, and with his work he gets drug tested randomly all the time. 
R:  Oh, I bet. [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, they have --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, four day weekend, they come back and they're drug tested, and a lot of guys lose their military careers that way, but you have to play by the rules. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  I have a friend who -- are -- are -- my girlfriend's son is stationed down in Pendleton.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  Um, his name is Aaron Raisin.  I know -- I know there's a million guys down there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] know if you've heard of him or not. [LAUGH] 
L:  No. 
R:  But he was -- I -- I'm not sure if he's home yet or not.  I need to call my friend and find out. 
L:  [LAUGH] There's some very --
R:  'Cause I know he was over there too. 
L:  Yeah, we just found out yesterday that he was coming home.
R:  Oh, that's great. 
L:  So, it was rather exciting.  Very exciting [LAUGH] [inaudible] it was so exciting.  So, we weren't expecting him home until January, that's when they told us to expect him home. 
R:  Next January?
L:  Yeah, they said when they left to expect them to be gone for a year. 
R:  Wow.
L:  Prepare yourself for a year.
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  So, that's what I prepared myself for, thank God it was not a year. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm glad we're too old to [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- well, my husband's too old to be drafted. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, to think my husband volunteered for all this. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Well, I, you know, I -- well, they don't have the draft any more anyway, so ...
L:  No.  No.  Thank God.
R:  They're all volunteers. 
L:  Yeah, so, but I don't think, yeah, I don't know how long we're supposed to talk about this [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, I guess we're supposed to hear a beep or something, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think we --
L:  No, I think that it's definitely a good idea.  I don't think it's an invasion of someone's privacy at all.  And [NOISE] -- that's pretty much it.  It is not a very talka- -- you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, there's not --
L:  Subject's not very --
R:  -- a lot to, ah, discuss on this topic if we --
L:  Considering --
R:  -- both are in agreement. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly, it's either yes or no. 
R:  If you get one person who says, "No", and one person who says, "Yes", then you might have someone trying to convince the other person, but ...
L:  Exactly but no, is this your first time doing this?
R:  This is my second call.
L:  Oh, okay.  This is my third.
R:  Okay.  So you're getting ready to get paid. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I'm waiting.  It'd be nice. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I think you don't get -- yeah, you have to wait till it's three calls.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You have to finish three calls before you -- before they -- you get --
L:  Oh -- 
R:  -- paid.
L:  -- okay.
R:  So ...
L:  So, how did you find out about this?
R:  I'm, ah, I'm trying to think.  Money and shopping dot --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- net.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Or money and shopping dot com.  It's a mystery shopping, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- website.

L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And they're -- they're two different websites that -- they're just referral websites.  One -- the one -- one s- site refers you to all different kinds of, ah, companies that do secret shopping --
L:  Oh, that's really neat.
R:  -- and the other company -- the other -- her other website refers you to all the companies, like this one there, where you basically -- you get paid to take surveys or you get paid to do --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- focus groups.

R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, you know, it goes to, like, the green fill and the pinecone research and, um, those kind of things online that pay you for surveys. 
R:  Okay.
