R:  Hi my name is Stephanie. 
L:  My name is Anne. 
R:  Hi Anne it's nice to meet you. 
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  Um, as far as the topic I do not really believe that public schools have the right to issue censorship however private schools I really feel like they do have the right to censor what their students read.
L:  Well, um, I feel like, um, every school should have the right to see that their children read decent literature and I know that there is a difference of opinion on what's decent.
R:  I agree.
L:  I don't think banning books is a good thing but I think prohibiting children until they're a certain age from reading a certain book is wise.  I mean as they get old enough they can read what they want but I feel that a small child, um, they're just like we should make choices for them.  I think we should make choices for them.
R:  I agree with that.  I -- I do agree that there are certain age limits that should be allowed to have access to certain material.
L:  Absolutely. 
R:  My daughter does go to a private school, so it's kind of difficult for me to answer that I mean when -- I attended a public school.
L:  I did too. 
R:  And there was not any sort of censorship as far as I was aware of um -- with my daughter's school however they do -- cause she's just in elementary school.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And there's no junior high age material or high school age material available to her but they do sort of censor the types of books that -- that come into there that they're allowed to read.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But for -- for the reason that we're paying for her to be there is the reason that we do want them to watch out what they get their hands on.
L:  Absolutely. 
R:  And I -- as far as public schools however I -- I agree with you they do need to be age appropriate material.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But how they go about doing that I just really don't know.
L:  Since I'm not an educator I don't know either but I -- I know they do have screening boards, uh, it seems like in libraries for you know elementary children that high school children don't go to and vice versa.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I mean people can't -- for example an isolated incident sometimes but a rule it should be able to be available -- the right material should be able to be available to the right age kids.
R:  Yeah I agree with that -- I, um, -- I don't like book banning and I don't like book burnings and that sort of thing myself.
L:  No -- no that's --
R:  I -- but I do agree that there is some things that just should not be in a school library.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and you know that's exactly the reason right now in the area that I'm living in we're in Texas and right now in the town that I'm living in I don't agree with the way that the public schools are being run here.
L:  Nobody much agrees with the way public schools are run.  Quite a few people in my area are home schooling.  I'm in Tennessee.
R:  Yes.  
L:  And, um, I was surprised at the number of people.  We're in the Bible belt here and the people are really appalled at what's going on in schools, it's the lack of discipline and the lack of supervision and, um, I don't know what kind of education people can get from home schooling but I know this guy -- saw the guy on TV he won this, uh, geography [inaudible] and he was a home school student, did you see him? 
R:  Yes I did.  I saw that.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Um, actually the town I'm in we hold -- they hold spelling bee's that go to the national spelling bee's and for the last three years the person -- the kids that have won the spelling bee's have been home school kids.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And we have a friend who home schools and says my daughter goes -- her private school is very small.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So she gets into a lot of and sports activities from -- from churches.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the church where she goes to play basketball they actually have, um, one man and his wife that runs a program of home schoolers and most of the kids that she plays basketball with are home school children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So home schooling has become quite popular.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it may be because of the reasons that people are just tired of not having more of a say in their child's education.
L:  And, uh, -- yes, um, I don't know what -- if somebody is supposed to monitor right and keep us on the subject.  Um, --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah I don't either.  [inaudible]
L:  I've never done -- this is my first interview.
R:  This is my first time too so I am not sure what I'm supposed to do.
L:  What we're expected to do.
R:  Uh, -- uh, I think we've covered the [LAUGH] I think we've covered the topic.  I don't agree with the fact that they -- they censor but I don't also I don't think they should have certain materials in schools.
L:  Me too and I don't know if they want us to get into anything else or not but it has been fun talking to you.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think they said that they'll give a tone when it's been the proper time --
L:  A certain length of time.
R:  But, uh, -- yeah I just -- there's a lot of home schooling going on here right now --
L:  But you know some of the things that are, um, that are puzzling me and I don't like about text books is -- is, um, they're getting so, uh, politically correct with their change in history.  I mean they've taken stuff out and they've -- I mean I don't know how if -- if something was going on at a certain time in history that you have to go back and change it because you know I don't know, I mean it needs to show that things that have evolved from what was once done wrong.
R:  Yes.
L:  To what's now instead of just taking it out that's my opinion on that.
R:  Yeah I agree with that too I don't -- I don't --
L:  And a lot of things that we were totally appalled at that we have to learn from our mistakes.
R:  Well sure.
L:  If they're never put in there the mistakes we made as a country and as a world the kids will not know about it.
R:  Yeah I agree with that they're trying to change and they don't want to talk about certain topics but that's the only way children can learn.
L:  That's right.
R:  And you know if they don't learn it now and the parents they'll teach them and they're not taught about it in school the school same thing is going to happen over again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [SIGH] I agree with you there too I don't think that that is right, um, --
L:  They should see it as if happened and see how it evolved into what it is and if there needs to be something else done and, um, and I do think that books should certainly play a heavy part in, uh, education because you just can't get it all off the computer that you know -- the computer's a wonderful tool but it's not going to take the place of your text book in my opinion.
R:  That's true -- that's true and they yeah I agree with that they should be allowed to put the proper information in there.  Everybody knows you know from -- from my generation and -- and everybody knows these things happened.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And to try now and just say, "Oh, that never happened" that's not right.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  I read that something in the newspaper about that not too long ago how this [inaudible] not using certain text books for that reason because they said it was just not, um, -- yeah.
L:  It might hurt somebody's feelings.
R:  Yeah I'm so -- yeah I'm so tired of that political correctness.  [LAUGH]
L:  I am too.  I am too.
R:  It does seem like --
L:  I mean I want everybody to be treated fairly and with all do respect but I think you can get -- just get to go so far [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, yeah I just feel -- I'm like you I don't -- I would treat people with respect as long as they're respectful to me.
L:  Absolutely -- absolutely.
R:  And otherwise you know I'm [SIGH] I -- I don't know if that's along [LAUGH] censorship or not but I -- I don't, um, -- I don't like people who are --
L:  Well I think change in history is not -- I mean I -- I -- I think that would be more of a censorship than leaving it alone.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes I agree -- yes I do I think that is a form of censorship also.
L:  I do too.  I do too.
R:  And I don't feel like that's right, um, [SIGH] other than -- that's not a very good topic to try to have to talk about cause once you've [LAUGH] --
L:  Once you've covered what you think about I don't know what we're --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  But I just -- have you done -- you haven't done any other interviews.
R:  No I haven't done any thing this is the first time they've called me.
L:  Me too.  Me too.
R:  And I was -- I was kind of in the middle of something but I didn't want to miss this chance.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  You can't stop so.
L:  But I signed up to do it.
R:  I did too so that's what I am trying to do.  Do my thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I -- I remember the laws of controversy when I was in school when the big controversial subject was whether or not they were going to allow the Tom saga and Huckleberry Finn stories in school.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  And that was back when I was in school and some of the things that they read in schools now are just like I thought my gosh why was there ever a problem with [inaudible] because some of the things they're reading now are much worse than what I've ever got my hands on when I was in junior high school.
L:  Well it -- they -- we have traded, um, I think it was because there was racial words --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and tones [inaudible] and now kids are able to see violence, sex, everything and that's alright you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's okay.
R:  That's fine but to use a term I -- I understand that that was why they took you know took offence to the book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I could understand that but you know I'm like you too it has to be taken from the time with which it was taken from.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And back at that particular time that he wrote the stories it was a common term.
L:  That was common yeah.
R:  That was common so I don't -- I don't
