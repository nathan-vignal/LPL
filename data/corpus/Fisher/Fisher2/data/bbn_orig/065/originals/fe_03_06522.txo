R:  Yeah, good afternoon, I'm Joseph Momo.
L:  Hi, I'm Marylou Gardner.
R:  I'm fine [NOISE] how you doing?
L:  Good, how're you?
R:  I'm o- -- I'm all right.
L:  What state are you from?
R:  Um, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, I'm from California.
R:  Ah, you co- -- California oka- --
L:  I'm from California, yeah.  Okay, our topic is, um, how do we feel about --
R:  Being tested for drugs in a job.
L:  Yeah, how do you feel about that?
R:  I -- I think it's okay, because I don't want to be working with people that are addicted or have drugs problem.  [PAUSE] Because if you -- if like you're working with addicted people or people are taking drugs all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the environment you are working in will not be safe.
L:  Right.
R:  Because how could somebody be high before going to work?
L:  Right.
R:  I like -- 
L:  Yeah, I feel -- yeah.
R:  Mhm, go ahea-
L:  I have the -- I feel they have a right to, uh, do drug testing at any time on anybody.  I -- I think that um I don't want to be around somebody that's um not um in their right mind and under the influence of a drug.  And who knows the people they hang around with and who knows their motive on uh money and whether they'd need money for drugs if they got addicted.  So I personally don't wanna be um working [NOISE] around somebody on drugs.  So I think that companies should be allowed to do drug testing and random [NOISE] drug testing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And if people don't like it they should just not work for the company.
R:  Yeah, definitely, definitely and because -- I mean[?], I +mechanic [inaudible] -- I work in a machine shop.  We operate --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like big machines and we have all these chemicals.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Hazar- -- chemicals that are not good for your health.  So like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if somebody is not in his right mind --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, if -s taken drugs before go to -- before I go to work, then I believe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one day you kill everybody.
L:  [NOISE] Right, if they make a mistake, it could be towards your health.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [NOISE] Or it could hurt you.
R:  Definitely it's a big --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- disaster.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And what -- like the [inaudible] like you[?].  When people -- like, when you start -- like most jobs we only do drug tests deciding to work -- de- deciding you are hired.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's it.  They never do drug tests again.
L:  Right.
R:  What's -- like some people they let[?] us, you know, I want the job, right.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I know I will go for a drug test in about a week.  
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  If I'm taking drugs --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- I will stop right now.  I --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- will stop for the week --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- and after I take the -- after the drug test and then I start again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, like I recommend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for companies like -- maybe like after every three months. 
L:  Right.
R:  Or every six months or -- or yearly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, like they do random drug tests for everybody.  Because --
L:  [NOISE] Right I -- yeah I think the --
R:  Bec- --
L:  -- only way they could get around it is random drug testing 'cause people will stop when they know they're gonna be tested, you know?
R:  Yeah th- that's the problem.
L:  So, I think that random -- I -- I wouldn't mind signing papers at work saying -- I work for the city, so I wouldn't mind saying, "Oh yeah, random drug testing is fine".  And people think it's an invasion of privacy -- only because they're guilty probably.
R:  Definitely, because I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how -- how would you inv- in- in- indulge in their privacy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you're trying to make me bes- -- trying to ma- -- to give me a safe working environment.
L:  Right, and -- and they're the ones who are paying you to do work for them during those hours, so you should not be under the influence while you're being paid by them.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, like they must --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- make it like a mandatory upon everybody at any --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- point in time --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- random drug test.
L:  Yes, I think so too.  [NOISE]
R:  They -- they must not like, inform peoples like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Next week we gotta do drug tests".  No, you just come in today and say, "Okay boy --"
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  "-- take tie off --" 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- drug test".  And --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  -- drug tests don't take more than two minutes.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Ju-
R:  Just do it there and then.
L:  Yeah, they should just take it whenever they want to and people don't like it they don't have to work for the company.
R:  Definitely, if you don't like it, don't come.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, 'cause there's a lot of companies out there that, you know, will hire people without having drug tests.  Going -- go to those companies.  So --
R:  Definitely and that's really, really unsafe.  Really --
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- unsafe.
L:  Yeah, and then, you know, people that [MN] usually are on drugs, are so far sometimes -- they know how much they can handle but who knows, you know, what they've had before and then they're at work and you never know what they're going to do.  I mean -- and the people they hang around with who knows that they would come to the work.
R:  People do- --
L:  You know, if they had a problem with them, or not paying for the drugs or something, if they got really bad.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I think, [MN] definitely, no drugs.
R:  On one thing I wanted to correct you -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you said like they know how much they can handle.  People don't know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- how much they can handle.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Let us assume now you taking -- like, let us -- somebody taking heroin, right?
L:  Right.
R:  You decide, "Okay, one pack -- I can handle one pack".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Some days in the morning -- like let's assume [several inaudible words] usual in the morning, like I don't [several inaudible words] "What's the matter with me today?"  This [inaudible] is fair enough.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe you eat something that is not, like, going with the drugs.  You say, "Okay --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- let me -- let me take another one".  Then --
L:  Right.
R:  You take it.  So you don't know what you can handle.
L: Yes.  And that -- yo- --
R:  You just guess and you say, "Okay this -- this'll be right for me, this'll be good".
L:  [SIGH]
R:  There is no measurement about the a- -- the a- -- the um -- the number you can take.  And these drugs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everybody like -- the drugs have different producers -- 
L:  Right.
R:  Different producers produce the drugs.
L:  Exactly that's --
R:  This is -- this is heroin -- this is producer A and producer B.  Their --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- products may be different.
L:  Right.  Yeah it --
R:  So yeah -- there you don't know you're going to take, so you just take. 
L:  Yeah.  You know if -- if drugs were so um [SIGH] -- if they -- if everybody knew how they would re- react on everything, they -- people wouldn't be dying of overdoses.
R:  Definite- -- mhm.
L: You know?  Because you think -- they think, "Oh well, just one more hit, one more hit.  Will that overdose somebody?"  Well, how do -- how do they know that it won't be something that's not going to react all right with their body and their, you know, mind?
R:  Well, the big problem with this American drugs problem is that the -- the government as a whole, they're condoning drugs -- the doctors.  Because -- like I was in school, some people are telling me, "Okay, I've pre- prescription for +antidepressants -- antidepressants".
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's drugs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you take antidepressants, that's drugs.  Let's ask the man -- you go for medication -- they give you like ten -- twenty.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're supposed to take like two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the others, they say, "Okay, I'm stressed.  My boyfriend stressed me out, okay.  Let me just take four".
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  That's it.  So, it's prescribed for you and then you take four.
L:  But you're abusing it.
R:  You -- yeah definitely abusing it and --
L:  [NOISE] Ye- ye- yeah.
R:  -- when you're abusing it, you not only hurting yourself, you're hurting other people.
L:  Right.
R:  Although no --
L:  'Cause you don't know how you're going to react.  It was prescribed for you for two and you're taking four -- that's also drug abuse.
R:  Definitely and when somebody's in drugs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- once you are addicted --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nobody can control you.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  You can just take it anything you want to do.  "Okay I can --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- take two. I can take four".  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've been used to just used to [several inaudible words] not working on the -- the big thing -- the big thing about drugs is this, some people start taking -- you know you start taking the lows -- the low key drugs -- you start --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- taking the low key -- after a while they not yo- -- you reacting any longer.  You say --
L:  Right.
R:  -- "Let me try this one".  If I take --
L:  Something more stronger.
R:  Definitely more stronger.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, you going it, there you go.  At the end of the day you don't know how b- -- how bad or how lost you be -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how lost you be behaving. 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And when you get addicted to these, like, y- you don't pay your bills, you don't go to work on time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't -- you don't know what you're doing, you become --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ragged, you can't --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- even take care of yourself.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [PAUSE]  Hm  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  It's really nice --
L:  So  [LAUGH]
R:  -- really nice if there are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- random drug tests for everybody!
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  And I don't know bu-
L:  Everybody not -- not just random people, it should be everybody.  They should come in on a -- on a day and say, "Okay, today, we're doing testing for everything" and it's like down the list they go for everybody.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It shouldn't be that hard. [NOISE]
R:  And I would l- -- I would like for like doctors to find another way rather than --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- giving people these antidepressant drugs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For them to say okay depr- -- like, I came from Africa.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In Africa -- I come from Sierra Leone[?].  There is nothing like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- antidepressant there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There is not like depression and over there beli- -- the -- the people of Af- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Africa must be more depressed than the people over here because here people have all the things they need.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Because no antidepressant there nobody prescribe drug for people.  When you get your problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you just stay cool and talk to your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's it.  So, you don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- need to be taking these drugs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- burning off your brain.  And when people's on drugs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they do any kind of thinking.  You are not yourself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you are on drugs you are not yourself anymore, you be taking all --
L:  Right.
R:  -- doing freaky and queer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I read -- I read about one guy he was so drunk.  He went off this building.  He said, "Okay, I believe I [several inaudible words] I can fly".
L:  Wow.
R:  That's a big problem and like most of his day care[?] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- young kids, they are in this day care -- there's people -- usually they take drugs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when they abuse --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --drugs, that's big problem for the kids.
L:  Yeah, once they get hooked they're hooked. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and when people are taking drugs nobody will know.  Like, since you take the first -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- drug test before you start the job, nobody asks you.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like you go to work tomorrow and somebody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- asks, "Are you on drugs today?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Nobody will do that.
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  They got used to the person.  So I'll sue you --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- "Why are you accusing me?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if you have like a policy that says okay random drug testing -- if you see somebody you know start to sigh, you -- you go tell your boss, "I'm not [several inaudible words] that boy".  He says, "Okay" so there's random drug testing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's the way people will be scared.
L:  Right.
R:  Testing drugs before going to work. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] Yep.
R:  Or after work even.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because [MN] --
L:  Yeah, right when they're going to leave or right when they come in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  One time have it during -- in the morning and ha- have it -- do it in the evening next [COUGH] the next time.  You know if they do it consistently at the same time people are going to know, "Oh, always in the morning" and they may go out and do their drugs in the afternoon, at lunch or something.  I know some people go out lunch and have drinks during their lunch time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And come back to work.  Well, to me drugs and drinking is the same thing. [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  It's an altering of the mind.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, peo- -- some people can't handle drinking either so, to me, that's an addiction.
R:  Defin-
