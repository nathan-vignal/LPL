L:  Hi, this is --
R:  Hi --
L:  -- this is Julie.
R:  [MN] Go ahead.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, Julie.
L:  Who's this?
R:  Sherry.
L:  Hi, Sherry.  Uh [LIPSMACK], are you --
R:  Where --
L:  -- divorced or married?
R:  I am divorced.
L:  Me too, happily [LAUGH].
R:  I was gonna say, isn't it -- so am I.  I've -- I've been married all my life to some guy or another.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How many times?
R:  Three.
L:  Really?  Just once for me, but that's because, you know, it was twelve years, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, I could never imagine why I could never be happy.  I think it's because I'm happy without having a guy around.
L:  Well, that depends on the guy.
R:  [MN] Well --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I have a great guy.  It's just, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe I'm too headstrong --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how 'bout you?
L:  [MN] Autumn[?], I'm on the phone, sweet[?] girl.  [MN] Anyway, d- -- um, the subject --
R:  Oh, you have a little one to take care of?
L:  [NOISE] I have four children.
R:  Ah.
L:  I have a nineteen year old, who's out of the house, a thirteen year -- a fourteen year old, a nine year old girl -- they're all girls -- and then the baby's two, and he is a boy.  
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And he's a terror [LAUGH].
R:  And it's really rugged to raise children without their dad around, 'cause that's what I did.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, it -- it depends on how helpful their fathers are, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Because my baby was, um, um, a surprise [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh [MN], well probably --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the best thing that came out of the end of the marriage then.
L:  [MN] Oh, no, he was, um, a surprise after I was already divorced [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  -- from my boyfriend.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Yeah, my boyfriend and I, we both had three children already, and I think the reason --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, we're not wanting to get married -- he was married for twelve years before as well --
R:  Right.
L:  -- actually he was married twice --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, um, and we're old enough now, that it's like, if I get married again, I don't wanna worry about divorce, I don't wanna have to figure out where we're gonna live or how I'm gonna [NOISE] pay for a house or --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- any of that, you know.
R:  I agree, I agree.
L:  So [MN] --
R:  I finally bought a house of my very own --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for a change.
L:  [MN] Awesome. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh, it's really hard.  It's good that you have a boyfriend that you're doing things with.  So, I guess, with four children, because, fortunately mine just are finally out of the house.  And, um, my daughter's in Italy, so she doesn't have to deal with my ups and down mood swings.  My son's close, but I have always -- you know how, even if you're living with someone, you basically are trying to do for them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you wrap everything you do around them.  It's so great whenever you're divorced though, and you don't have -- when the children are finally gone, and you only have you and your dog [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to worry about.  It really is great.
L:  Oh, I don't -- I have the girls, so I don't live with anyone.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, it's just like, [NOISE] "Yes, Autumn".
R:  Oh, you don't live with your -- your girls?
L:  Uh, uh -- he lives across the country, actually [LAUGH], yeah.
R:  Oh, my.  Well, where are you?
L:  We're gonna move out there, um, sometime this year.  He just got transferred over to California.  So --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- we're -- we're gonna move out there this year, but we're not -- we're still not gonna live -- I have girls --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, unless I'm married, I'm not staying in a house with a guy.  D- -- does --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that make sense, I mean ...
R:  Yes, it does.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sure it does, I agree.  
L:  [MN] It's just I wanna be a good example for them, and -- and I already had a [MN] -- sort of a bad example by having a baby by no- -- and not being married, but --
R:  Yeah, well that --
L:  -- you know, I mean --
R:  -- was -- like you said, that was a surprise.
L:  Yeah, it was.
R:  That's a good way to explain it to the children.
L:  He's an IUD baby [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] You're kidding?  I had one that --
L:  I'm not kidding.
R:  -- way.  My daughter was born when I had one of those IUD things.  
L:  Yeah, they get dislodged sometimes, and that's --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- apparently what happened with him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we just ... sucked it up --
R:  Well, what part of the country are you living in now?
L:  Ohio.
R:  Ohio?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, you're close.  I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm in Cleveland.
R:  Oh.  Are you an SFer?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Um, what [MN] -- where do you -- what type of work do you do?
L:  Um, I do help desk work, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I have, um, been unemployed for a few months now --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- still looking for a job.  Kinda sucks [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Well, check the internet.  If you know anything about the internet, there are tons  [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, I'm -- yeah, but there are just -- there's not that many in this area.
R:  No?  Oh.
L:  No, they're -- everyone's getting downsized, so all the IT departments, not just help desk people, but --
R:  Well, I mean things like where you can basically make as much money at -- at home --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing things on the internet and still be with the children and, um, not have to go out and work, and you pick what times you wanna work and so forth.  If you know the internet at all, or the computer at all --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm -- I di- -- I was a web designer --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- too, so [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  You wouldn't believe -- just jump in there, girl, and just put a search word in, you'll find all --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sorts of positions that you could do from home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's great.  I make money hand over fist -- 
L:  [NOISE] I used to.
R:  -- and I -- I only go out whenever I feel like, "Oh, yeah, this job looks exciting" or something.  And --
L:  I used to make money like that [LAUGH].
R:  Did you?
L:  But now I just -- now it's like -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  You sleep?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Did you say you sleep?
L:  [NOISE] No, I just told my kids to be quiet --
R:  Oh [LAUGH]. 
L:  -- 'cause I can't hear you.
R:  Yeah, I can hear them --
L:  So -- 
R:  -- I can hear them.
L:  It's like --
R:  So, that's -- yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the last gal I spoke with was Claire[?] from Wyoming --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but -- how did you hear about this study?
L:  Um, one of my friends sent me a link --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in the email --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- [LAUGH] an email, and said, "Hey, try -- you know -- try doing this, it's pretty cool".
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I'm surprised because I've told a few of my friends.  They say, "Oh, no, that's -- that's hogwash".  I mean, even if I didn't get paid for it, it's nice meeting new people --
L:  It is.
R:  -- you know, all over --
L:  This -- this is like only my second call, so --
R:  Is it?  It's my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- second call too.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] So, we're tied neck and neck here.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  But don't worry --
L:  I think the reason why people aren't being married now though is 'cause -- is because of that, the divorce thing.  It's so easy --
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  -- [MN] it's -- it's -- an- -- an- -- and, I don't know, we make enough money on our own that we don't necessarily have to [LAUGH] --
R:  You're right, you're --
L:  -- have to be with someone [LAUGH], so --
R:  You're right, that's true.  Because, as far as I know, most -- well, quite a few of the divorced people, they wanna be independent.  They're not even accepting the child support or anything any more --
L:  So -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  Oh, no, I'll accept it, 'cause I did not make them by myself, and it's not --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- fair that I have to take care of them by myself.
R:  Really?  Well, I --
L:  And that's how I -- that's exactly how I feel, it's not fair for me to bear the -- you know, we already bear all the bur- -- I think women bear the burden of everything --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- you know, I don't --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and I think that's another reason why it's like, why get married, because [LIPSMACK], I don't know, y- -- you -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you do the same thing, you go to work, you come home --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you do all the stuff with the kids, you get everybody ready, you always clean, you're the one that does everything.  All --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- the guy has to do is work, come home and sit on his butt --
R:  Right --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- and expect you to wait on him hand and foot.  [MN] But, uh, I agree, because we carry two jobs -- three jobs actually.
L:  Exactly --
R:  And --
L:  -- we're the mothers, we're the cleaners, we're the errand runners, we're the chauffeurs --
R:  And we have to console them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- make sure everybody's happy ... um --
L:  We're the ones that don't go straight to bed --
R:  Right, right.  If you get enough sleep --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a miracle, it really is.  Well, I think the worst thing, though -- how are your children dealing with the divorce?
L:  [NOISE] Um, at first it was bad, but it's --
R:  How are --
L:  -- been nine years.
R:  Oh, it's been nine years?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], yeah.
R:  Oh, my goodness, you've been divorced for a long time then, well --
L:  Yeah.  Very -- and very happy with it [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, wow.
L:  I actually didn't date anybody for four years.
R:  Oh, really?  Well, I had -- I've had a lot of guys asking me to go out, but I've -- you know what?  I've been married three times, I don't really --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- um, d- -- I went straight into the army out of high school, so this is the first time in my entire life I have been responsible for me, and I'm taking care of the house, I bought my -- and I was approved for my own, which is really hard for a woman to get approved for a house one hundred per cent on her own [MN].  And I made it, and I am just enjoying every minute of it.  I don't think I even wanna -- I'm afraid to go out.  I go out with the guy a couple times and he wants to get married, so --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  -- I think it's the men -- the men who really -- they wanna be married, but they're --
L:  Well, yeah, 'cause they get all the good benefits.
R:  -- too [inaudible].  Right, right.  And they -- they wanna get married, but they don't want it for any length of time, you know?
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  When they get tired, there's always another gal around the corner [NOISE].  I -- I like it living here with just my doggy, come on in [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- whereas you've got your children to tell to come in -- I'm just letting him in right now.  [MN] All right, how's the weather over in Ohio today?
L:  Cold, like --
R:  Cold?
L:  -- sixty maybe.
R:  Oh, it's --
L:  Yeah, chilly, put it --
R:  -- beautiful here.
L:  -- that way.  And -- but it's sunny, so --
R:  Oh, yeah, it's beautiful here.  I'm glad -- I'm glad they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- caught me now, because I'm just about on my way out for a big barbecue celebration.  Are you going out today?  Or are you celebrating at home?
L:  No, actually, I'm sending -- one of my girls is going to visit her, uh, her -- uh, my other daughter's godparents --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so they're here waiting for her to go.  And --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- I'm like, "Wait, wait", you know what I mean, I told 'em to wait, 'cause I don't want --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- 'em to leave yet.  But, um, no I'm just gonna hit the grocery store today --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I can do my cooking tomorrow [LAUGH].
R:  That's a good idea -- that's a good idea --
L:  So ...
R:  [MN] Like my son, he's having his celebration today, so he and his girlfriend can have their own free time with each other tomorrow, but, um -- so that works out good for them.  I'm trying to put a doggone doorknob in my door by myself.  That I've never done before --
