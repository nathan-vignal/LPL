R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Hi, my name's Breanna.  
R:  Hi, Breanna, how are you doing?
L:  I'm okay.  How are you today [SIGH]?
R:  I'm doing good.  
L:  Good [LAUGH].
R:  Good.
L:  [MN] Okay. [MN] So, what do you think?
R:  I disagree with it, like, totally.  I am so against the drug testing on behalf of employees.  I think that it is definitely invade of privacy.
L:  Uh-huh.  I, um -- 
R:  I mean, when I, [NOISE] you know, on my private time, it's none of their business.
L:  Right.  I -- I don't have a problem with it, as well, I don't.  I don't see a need for it, unless it pertains to your job [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but, you know, like if you're slacking, or you're late all the time, or there's a problem with you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then I think they really should crack down on you.  But, I agree, I mean, your private time is your private time [MN].
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [MN] What do they mean to be invading on [LAUGH]?
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
L:  Or questioning, or I mean, what if -- what if the practice is -- you know, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they catch something, and it's -- but it is wrong, or you know.  Antibiotics, or this or that, or they -- I mean, then you're fighting for your job.
R:  It -- yeah, exactly.  Exactly, that's what [inaudible].
L:  You know, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if yo -- what type of jobs are going to be doing that?  Plus, it's so expensive.  You've gonna do -- a job's going to be paying for ea- -- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] every employer to do that, or ...  I mean, I could see if you catch -- I mean, or even them doing it on the job, like if they're smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pot in the back room, or something, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, okay, I have -- I agree, I have a problem with that, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, as long as you don't come to work, you know, messed up or nothing [inaudible], they should have no problem.  
L:  Right.  You're doing your job, you know, you show up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] [inaudible]
R:  I had a, um -- I had -- wa- -- was working with this company out in Colorado --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I had -- was doing it through this temporary service, so when I came on permanently, you know, I had to take the drug test, and go through the credit check and all that stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they had me take the drug test and I had went and took it, and then they were -- they told me that it takes three days for the company to get the results back.  Do --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, that company waited two months --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- to tell me that I didn't pass the drug test.  
L:  Oh, my gosh.  So, did you have the job for two months then?
R:  It -- yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  And after that, they was like, "We have to let you go".  Not, "Can you retest?"  There was no, "Can you retest?"  It was, "We have to let you go". 
L:  Oh, my go --
R:  I'm like, "That is shitty" [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no kidding?  Wow.
R:  Yeah, they did me wrong.  I was like, "Okay" [LAUGH].
L:  But they liked you while you did your job, right?
R:  Exac- -- yes, I did my job, you know, there on time every day, putting in overtime for them, doing work that wasn't even under my, um, responsibilities, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, it was just ridiculous.  I was like, "Wow, I can't believe y'all are coming at me like this".
L:  Right, they're just like, "Oh, sorry, you've got -- you failed", that's it?  Like ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Wow.  See, I've always --
R:  And, see, I was thinking it was around, like, month end time, [MN] -- the end of the year and everything, so they -- and I was in, um, accounting, so it was like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they were keeping me there to [MN] help them out on the work and then let me go after --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- all that was finished, you know.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, that's evil.
R:  It is.  So -- but I --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I was -- I can't deal with the whole -- the drug test and the credit check, the background check.  All that stuff has nothing to do with me coming on my job, doing my work.  
L:  Yeah, yeah.  No, yeah, I tot- -- I mean, I always sa- -- we say, "Oh, you know, if you're subjected to it, you have to --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- da da da da da" --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and I -- and, well, yeah, sure, whatever.  But I never --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, I guess I should take it more serious than it is, 'cause I never really do.  You know, for what they're doing, or asking or questioning.  But, I mean, I mean, it's the same thing with just even alcohol.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean, y- y- you drink too much alcohol, you know, the -- the day -- the night -- ah, you know, by the time you get into work --
R:  Night before, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you're horrible.  You're sluggish --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you don't want to be there, you gotta headache.  I mean, you -- you're worthless too.  I mean, what's the point of that?  You're gonna take breathalyzers as well?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  So, I mean --
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- but it is true.  I mean, that's what I feel like, I mean, if you have a problem with -- a problem with that type of job --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, where people are [inaudible] it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know, you know, maybe -- maybe in, like, doctors' offices or something, you know, where they're around it, or they could be around it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, that makes sense, but ... [NOISE] I don't know, if I work in a restaurant, I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in -- [MN] I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It seems --
R:  And then, like, what you were saying about the, uh, how ex- excessive it gets.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now they're doing it where the, uh, like you would have to pay for --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it out of your first pay check. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, so you -- oh, my gosh, that is ridiculous.
R:  [LAUGH] Isn't it?  Isn't it? [LAUGH] I'm like, "Why I gotta pay for a drug test?" -- they want --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- to hire me.  
L:  Exactly.  If you want me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that bad.  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh, I see, I had no idea.  
R:  [MN] Companies, businesses are really getting ridiculous on the criteria for, you know, the hiring cri- criteria.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just ridiculous.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's like, your freedom's not your freedom any more.
L:  Oh, no, not at all.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We don't have anything.
R:  No, that doesn't mean anything.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.  So, where do you work for now?  Do you work for a company that ...?
R:  Actually, I'm not working [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  That's probably why, 'cause I don't want to take no drug test. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Leave me alone".
L:  Hey, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] But no, I've -- I -- I've, uh, found a job where I don't have to go through the whole drug testing --
L:  Right, everything, uh-huh.
R:  -- and background check.  I -- I model and act.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  Much better [LAUGH].
L:  Well, uh -- where are you calling from?
R:  Ah, Georgia.  
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- LA [MN].
R:  Oh, okay.  I've been trying to get out there. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- oh, [several inaudible words] I was like, "Well, where are you?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no, they don't really -- they don't check for all those kinds of things.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, you're kinda [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] I'm safe in that profession then [LAUGH].
L:  You're safe in that -- [LAUGH]. [SIGH] No, yeah, no, my company's never questioned or said anything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- about it --
R:  Is it a big company?
L:  -- or just -- no, it's -- it's a brand new company, a start up company --
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
L:  -- and such, but -- they do them -- they're not, you know, "Your business is your business", you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  When I -- when -- you know, their time is their time.  And you're on their time --
R:  Right.
L: -- of course, you know, they're paying you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] but, anything beyond that ... I mean, it's just the same thing with, like, cops.  They have to, you know, if they get called in after hours or there's a shootout or da da da, they have, you know, "Are you able to come in?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, they have to be straight, and just -- I mean, and that's hard, because it's like you're incriminating yourself by being like, "No, I can't come in".
R:  Right, if I'm drunk.
L:  "Well, why can't you come in?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, "I'm ju- -- I'm plastered right now".  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I mean, how good -- that doesn't look good either --
R:  No.
L:  -- but, yet, you're on your off time, so it should be okay to do what you want to do, like you're saying --
R:  Exactly.   
L:  -- like.  [LIPSMACK] You know, "It's Memorial Day weekend, I can do whatever I want".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're not expecting a phone call to be like, "Come into work, we --", you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like, oh --
R:  [inaudible] just get out -- it gets out of hand.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].
R:  And I know here there was a judge who, um, like, on his lunch break or, you know, after work or whatever, he'd go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the bar and have a couple of drinks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The news crew followed him, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, just made it out that he's -- he's wrong for doing that, he's a judge and, you know, he's not supposed to be doing all that.  I was like, "Man --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- when is your time your time?"
L:   Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's human.  He probably --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- needs a drink.  I mean --
R:  You know, after sentencing everybody to jail and shit, he needs that.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, his conscience has got to him.  I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- mean, at least he's drink- -- I mean, I don't know, I guess that's not a good thing.  But it's not like he's getting into the car plastered and driving away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, that's different than having, you know, a drink at the bar with your friends, or hanging out, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I think it depends on context --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of wherever, you know, or whatever you're doing.
R:  Yeah, that's what I think, too.
L:  [NOISE] I don't -- oh [MN], I don't know.  I mean, maybe I -- I guess maybe if I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] an owner of a business and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- know it from that way, maybe it'd be different, my perspective would be different from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I know I, you know, have a lot of, uh, friends that are teachers, and they have to do background checks and everything like that to make su- -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with kids and stuff like that.  So, I don't know.  I guess ... but, like, working for McDonalds and whatnot, I don't [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] I don't really think that it's mandatory.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  You know, and especially -- I mean, people who work for places like that.  I mean, I've even worked for places like that, I mean, you're not working there for -- for great benefits
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're working there for, you know, a quick job, or you need money, or whatever it is.  And they're gonna take it -- and now you're saying, you know, they take it out of your pay checks?  I'm like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [MN] you mean, you can't afford to be taking everything out of there, you're only working for minimum wage.
R:  I know, right.
L:  You know?  And all of [inaudible], you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ... [MN] I guess there's -- and what do they do, I mean, do they turn you in?  Like, once they've -- they -- that your -- I mean, did -- did your employer just go like, "Oh, you're terminated, that's it"?  Or did they [MN] --
R:  Yeah.  They did.
L:  They did?
R:  [inaudible] they just said I was terminated.
L:  That -- and that was it?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Did -- I mean, did they even tell you, like, "Oh, you failed" and this or that, or it just, "Nope, sorry, goodbye"?
R:  Yes, she was just, uh --
