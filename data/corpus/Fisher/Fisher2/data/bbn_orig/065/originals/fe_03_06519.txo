R:  I thought we [inaudible] drug -- drug testing 
L:  Um --
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, I think -- I think to a certain extent that it's okay.  Just because --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  To what extent?
L:  Huh?
R:  To what extent?
L:  I think, um, just, you know, maybe when checking for employment and things like that because you never know, like, what could be going on.  You never know what's going on with an employee before you hire him, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's why -- that's why, uh, companies conduct background tests and things like that.  And so, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, if you find out something before you hire the employee, then I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that could be a potential to disrupt work at the work place, especially if the drug abuse problem comes into the workplace, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Both saying the same thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  If I was [inaudible] yeah.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Any time employment, honesty.  'Specially driving --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- vehicle or --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- [MN] operate heavy machinery and working with children.
L:  Yeah.  Anything like that should definitely require -- 
R:  Yeah.  But some people against it.  [NOISE] Not the [several inaudible words] have the drugs or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think I'm just for it all the way.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I [several inaudible words] all the way.
L:  I'm sorry, I can't --
R:  I found --
L:  -- I can't -- I think my phone's breaking up. 
R:  -- I'm for drug testing all the way from the beginning.
L:  Oh, yeah, okay.
R:  'fore they get the job.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that -- well, what you do after you get the job is something different,
L:  Yeah.  That's what I think also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm not against it at all.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's actually not what you do, it's how you do it too.
L:  Yeah, it is.  I guess, uh, guess that problem can be perceived as coming to the workplace, as in, like, people actually abusing drugs at the workplace.  I think that it's fully justified to test for that also.
R:  Yeah.  I [several inaudible words] right before you get to work.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not like some are hours some still get to work.
L:  Yeah.  That also.
R:  [inaudible] that is [several inaudible words] the work performance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [several inaudible words] they must have some way of [several inaudible words] the job you're doing -- applying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think it's for all jobs to me.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, we both agree with that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Cannot debate with you on this one
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] We both think the same with that one. 
L:  Yeah.  The exact same opinion.
R:  [inaudible] have you been drug tested for a job?
L:  Uh, yeah.  I have actually.
R:  Okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  No.
L:  Not yet.
R:  No.  I'm not working so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [several inaudible words] they have tried telling drug testing before [several inaudible words] job [inaudible] or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's not to know, it's totally different.  [COUGH] excu- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] That's how it is.  There's always a way to beat the drugs system test too.
L:  Yeah.  There are; people find creative ways.
R:  I know I use one myself.  It's a different liquid you can drink.  Different [several inaudible words] so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's exactly -- it lasts about eight hours --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It risks all [NOISE] drug testing. 
L:  Hm.  
R:  'Xactly and I wish [several inaudible words] is how you do it.  [NOISE] Reckon I'm for drug testing to [NOISE] [PAUSE] uh, you -- because it that be the test for the job you're working now?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Are you testing a job you working at now?
L:  No.  Not the job I'm working at now.  I had an internship --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in, uh, LA that I had to be tested for.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So -- it was last summer actually.
R:  Last summer?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- did you finish the internship?
L:  Yeah, I finished.  It was just a summer internship.  It was, uh, between my junior and senior year in college so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] What else are we going to talk about drug tests?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But we both agree on the same topic.  [MN]
L:  But what?  Yeah.  We both do agree, exactly.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] got any -- nothing to debate about.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It's no fun when it's like that, huh?
R:  N- no.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think e- everybody should be tested.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And some people in government too should be tested to me.
L:  Yeah.  I think so.  [MN] 
R:  Over congress in the White House --
L:  Yeah.  It shouldn't be --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- limited to a certain, you know, blue collar jobs or anything like that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it should extend to every job. 
R:  Should test everybody
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] everybody should get tested least once.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause a lot of the times the, uh, white collar workers are the ones that have the most money and can afford the more high class drugs, you know, so -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- it should be given to them also.
R:  Y- -- they have -- even pay someone to, um, have the results [inaudible] too.  They change the results.  
L:  Yeah.  They could.
R:  Where did you get the money?  Yeah.  They say money is foul.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, what else will we talk about? 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, good.  [NOISE] 
L:  How's the weather over there in DC?
R:  It's pretty good -- it's crazy though; one minute it's c- -- hot and next minutes it's cold.
L:  Oh.
R:  Doesn't stop raining.
L:  Okay.
R:  Just that [several inaudible words] 'cause then they too hot.  Not too --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- cold.  They're just cool.   We probably get a lot of rain that you don't.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  [inaudible] wishing you had a lot of rain all this week.
L:  Oh, a lot of rain this week?
R:  Yeah.  Rain every day except it --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- today, it's not raining today.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Well, it rains all day we make a [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh.  How do you feel -- how else do you feel about drug testing?
L:  Well, I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm definitely for it.  And I don't know, I don- -- I don't really see it as an invasion of privacy at all because, at the same time, you know, they re not coming to your home and testing you if you're doing it at home.  They -- they're testing you because they want to see, you know, how that would affect --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- your performance at work and doing drugs while on the job could obviously, you know, hinder your performance at work and make you come in late.  Could cost the company a lot of money.  So, that I mean, the company's only looking out for its own interests.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  Yeah.  And, like, especially so that it could affect the safety of the other employees or safety of other people involved with their job especially, like, you said if, you know, the job involves working with children or operating heavy machinery and things like that.  Those jobs --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- should definitely, definitely have drug testing.  Especially anything to do with children I think.  Or any other people. 
R:  Thing -- I thought -- I thought testing [several inaudible words] to me.
L:  Huh?
R:  I said I thought it was a drug though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] testing [several inaudible words] testing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they not really drink.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Don't like drug test.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I got a different kind of drug.  This illegal drug. 
L:  Yeah, it is.  [MN] It's hard to test for that though, isn't it?
R:  No.  [NOISE] What [several inaudible words] you yesterday is.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, if you come -- if you come drunk to work then that's pretty obvious.  But other than that it's kind of hard because I think alcohol leaves your system pretty quickly.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Not the drunk.  Twelve hours [several inaudible words] system.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, That's why they are trying to control it though and [several inaudible words] test to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] so they definitely drink it.  [NOISE] [MN] [LAUGH] 
L:  So, have you -- y- -- have you -- you've never been drug tested ever?  Not once?
R:  Yes, I have.
L:  Oh, you have?
R:  It's something -- a totally different [inaudible] really not for a job though.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] [several inaudible words] we just shift 'em through [inaudible] the core system.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I haven't [several inaudible words] that big a test.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Think they leave 'em with some of [several inaudible words] were told they wouldn't -- they were scheduled to take the drug test.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I was working round 'em today.
L:  Oh.
R:  There's always a right, uh, way to do it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Makes that difference [several inaudible words] heads up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Having nobody, like, do it.  Offer to pay her for [NOISE] I know what it -- what to do and I'll pass it every time.  [PAUSE] And if you want to know what they're doing, have [several inaudible words] judge us anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [several inaudible words] test it for drug.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  What do you feel about drug tests for athletes and things like that in school?  Like the athletes on scholarships and things like that?  You think that should be justified?
R:  Should be justify?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.
L:  You don't think so?
R:  [several inaudible words] justify.  What you consider justify?
L:  Huh?
R:  What have you got say to justify?
L:  I can't hear you, I'm sorry.
R:  What do you consider justify?
L:  Oh.  I was just wondering if you think that it's okay for a spec[?] -- let's -- let's say the University of Maryland or someone to drug test their basketball players?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I believe that.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I think -- I think they're representing the school and that 'specially the school's giving them a scholarship or something like that.
R:  [NOISE] I know mostly test for hormones.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean steroids.
L:  Yeah.  What about with recreational drugs though?  'Cause they do test for that also; like marijuana or something like that.
R:  Oh, let 'em go.  [inaudible] they got a good point so, uh -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oughta find a person looks it -- look at it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [several inaudible words] they have test or -- for this one [several inaudible words] you know, be doing drugs and hear back a lot -- back off if you can
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you can't back off doing something else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have a different type of formula where, [PAUSE] or work for yourself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Work for yourself [NOISE] --
