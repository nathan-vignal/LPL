R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Um --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- my name is Veronica and I'm participating in the Fisher study. 
R:  I am, too.  My name is Tracey.
L:  Tracey.  Hi.  
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, I guess the topic we're supposed to talk about is high profile criminal trials and whether --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they should be televised?  Have you ever watched anything like that on television?
R:  Uh, yes, I have.  
L:  Was that possibly the OJ Simpson trial?  Or was it --
R:  Um --
L:  -- something else?
R:  Uh, there was that one and something else.  Uh, the Carr[?] brothers.  
L:  I'm not --
R:  I don't know if you --
L:  -- familiar with that.
R:  You -- yeah.  There was a -- a big homicide here in Wichita.  They killed, like, five people I think it was, or four people.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  Yeah.  And uh, they raped uh two females and uh one of them got away.  In fact, one of the females got away.  She was testifying so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it was a big trial.
L:  I can imagine.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, how did you feel that the TV coverage, um, impacted the trial?  Do you think it made a difference in -- in the way people perceived it or -- or -- I imagine the jury was sequestered?  They weren't aware of public opinion during the trial?
R:  Yeah, they kept them, uh, away.  Um, I -- well, I -- I've -- I think there's a lot of, um -- a lot of, um, uh, impact that it can have on a community.  In -- in fact, you know, there's a lot of things that can, uh, they can prejudge a lot of stuff then and in a way it's good and in a way I don't think it's always necessary.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Well, um, because I think it might -- they might get more stereotypical on certain people, you know, and --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- so you quickly judge 'em.  Um, but it's also good to let people learn maybe how the judicial system works and where it plays into that. 
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Um, when -- when you were watching it, did -- did you -- [MN] did you feel you learned more about the case that way that you could of just by reading newspaper reports or hearing it on the radio or something or --
R:  [MN].
L:  -- watching the TV new -- well, TV news sometimes has a brief excerpt --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- from a court hearing or something.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, most definitely.  I mean, you learn a lot more about the case.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE].  A lot more -- there is a lot more stuff that goes into, you know, they're sharing evidence upon evidence upon evidence, you know, and they got -- of course, they got all the people that are -- you know, the witnesses and stuff that are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, up there testifying too, and you know, you're getting to hear their side of the story and, you know, that's more than what you definitely hear on the news or in a newspaper.
L:  That's true.  That's usually just a summary --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh.  Huh.  Um, I wonder -- I -- I've never been involved in a high profile case of any kind.  I was wondering how it would be for the witnesses to know that they were being televised, if that would make them nervous or fear -- fear reprisals maybe from a fam- you know, I don't know about these cases, if it were gang members --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or something, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it would make them frightened or more --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- reluctant or affect their testimony in some way?
R:  Oh, I'm sure they're nervous about it.  Uh, in fact, the one that I was just telling you about that happened here, they uh, that particular witness that got away, they had her, uh, concealed.
L:  Aha.
R:  You know, um, she wasn't uh -- you know, she refused to have her -- her -- her face televised, but she still, you know, testified.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- um, yeah, there -- that -- that -- I could see where that would, uh, that would probably scare people, to get up there and do that.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, especially --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if, you know, especially when you know that there's a -- a chance that they could get out or they could probably do something else, you know, if they see you or know who you are.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, and the same thing goes for the juries.  The jury people, so you know, they --
L:  Oh, in -- in the trials that you watched, they actually showed the -- the jury?
R:  Um, they did not show -- well, no, they did show some of the jury.  They showed some of the jury after the trial, too.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, yeah.  They had them up -- uh, held up in a hotel, um, guards all around.  I don't think they ever let them, uh -- they never let them be seen by anybody, I don't believe, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But afterwards, afterwards they did show, uh, some of the jury.  So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No, them guys pro- you know, I don't know if I'd probably do that.  I'd probably just, you know, let it be as -- you know, as a trial there, let's leave it there.
L:  Right. 
R:  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- no need to get up on a TV and show your face to everybody, so --
L:  Yeah.  Mm.  I would be wary of that, too.  [LAUGH].  Have you ever been on -- on a tr -- uh, a jury?
R:  No, I have not.  Have you?
L:  Yeah, I -- I was on a jury for two, uh, cases in a superior court, but they were -- they were minor cases.  One was, um, burglary and one was, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- malicious mischief, so it wasn't, uh, really highly emotionally charged material or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- things that would make me feel afraid to -- to be on a jury.  But um, I don't know, that --
R:  Did you -- did you learn a lot from that?
L:  I did.  I -- I was surprised at how openminded the other members of the jury were.  Uh, I think people felt a reluctance to rush to judgement, even though these cases were not big deal death penalty cases --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or anything.  Um, they were very considerate of the evidence and -- and wanting to make the right choice so that they wouldn't either let a guilty person go free or convict an innocent person.  So that was -- that was reassuring to me, that the system kind of works.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh, but um, I don't know.  I -- I -- I find it stressful to -- to kind of sit in judgement on other people so I -- it's not something that I enjoyed, but it was very interesting.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if I could -- I don't know if I could -- I mean, I could do it, it's just the fact of, um, you know, you got somebody watching, your head's right there and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wa- if you made that wrong decision, you know, that's something that's gonna be there for -- forever for 'em, so --
L:  Right.  Right.  Although with the laws changing now, I -- I -- and with DNA evidence, uh, maybe there's a little more reassurance that you're not going to be convicting someone who's innocent, you know?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, that -- well, that would be a concern of mine, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but uh, I -- I -- I don't watch the court programs on television, like they have Judge Judy and --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know what else is in your area, but --
R:  Occ- occasionally I watch that, but that -- that's almost like, you know, your civil, your little district thing where it's like traffic court violations.
L:  Oh.
R:  I mean, that's not -- you know, they got people up there defending themselves and of course, they're not gonna know -- know the law.  They're just presenting what happened and that's it and, you know, then the judge is up there, just saying, "Okay.  Well, I feel you're lying so I'm gonna give it to this other guy", you know?  So --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, uh, it's not like -- well, even though they court TV and have -- I think I watched a little bit of something on there.  Now, they -- now they go into stuff in more detail.  You know, they got their lawyers up there and arguing defense and stuff --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, you know, they -- it's more, uh, uh, more I guess to the legal system area where, you know, you're -- you're gonna see that.  
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  It's -- it's probably a lot more, uh, rules and regulations in that kind of court situation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than if just --
R:  Most definitely.
L:  -- people are acting as their own counsel.
R:  Mm.  
L:  Do you watch the -- the court type fiction programs on TV?  Like, I -- I don't know what they're call- like "The Practice" or uh, any of those on --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- network TV?
R:  I -- I think the only one that I actually ever watched was, uh, uh, gosh, what was the one?  Ah, oh, I can't remember which one it was.  I -- I watched a little bit of "Judging Amy" and --
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  -- so I've watched some of "The Practice" before.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then there's that other one, the um, the one with that -- that -- that lady, um, gosh, dang it.
L:  Mm. 
R:  It --
R:  Um --
L:  That wouldn't be one of the "Law and Order" ones, would it?
R:  No, wouldn't be the "Law and Order".  It was, uh, it was kinda more of a comedy judge type thing.  Or --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- judge lawyer one.  Um, can't think of that lady's -- chick's name.  Um --
L:  I'm afraid I don't know that one.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I'm trying to think of -- I know Heather Locklear played in it, so --
L:  Oh.  
R:  Ah, gosh.  Dang it.  
L:  Was that a while back or --
R:  Oh, yeah, I think so.  I don't even think they have it on here any more, so --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but -- but those fiction -- I've seen "The Practice" a couple of times and -- and the cases they deal with are usually very dramatic, high profile kinda things.  Murder and rape and you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the horrible stuff and um, there always seems to be some sort of moral dilemma for the -- the lawyers [LAUGH] involved.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, I don't know if that happens in real life or not.  I -- I don't know --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- how true to -- true to form they are.
R:  Yeah.  I'm pretty for sure it does.  I mean, they're gonna have to really step away from some stuff if they really -- you know, especially if there's a lot of evidence, and you were saying that there are clients that are guilty, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're gonna have to sit there and try to convince themselves first and -- and then try and go and do that.  You know, 'cause I can- I don't think I could judge or um, or uh, or um, you know, try to defend somebody when I got all this evidence up here that's straight -- you know, straight pointing right there saying, you know, "You did it" and, you know, how are you supposed to do that, you know?  You wouldn't be able to --
L:  Right.
R:  But I --
L:  I don't know -- I don't know how they do that.  
R:  Well, I --
L:  Well, it -- 
R:  They're just getting the money, though, so [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Oh, man.  I wonder if, like when -- when the -- the big kinda cases that are actually dramatized on TV, like -- like the OJ Simpson case --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if the lawyers kind of play to the camera?  You know, if they -- if they make things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- present things in a way that makes it more dramatic, um, in a way that will benefit their client, you know?  
R:  I'm certain they did.
L:  I wonder if that has an impact on the way they deliver their arguments --
