L:  Hello,
R:  [MN]  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm David from Mississippi.
L:  I'm Teri and I'm in Tyler, Texas.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Not a northerner.  How you doing?
L:  I'm doing great.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing good.
L:  It kinda startled me when the phone rang this evening.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.  Uh, the -- well, the phone rang earlier for me and then I missed it and so I just called the -- the one eight hundred number.
L:  Yes.
R:  The one eight six six number.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  [MN]  So, I think I missed some of the questions.  It said, um, have the -- has the divorce rate, uh, has the divo- divorce rate changed my -- what -- what was the topic?
L:  Your attitude --
R:  My --
L:  -- and thinking about, um, your marriage.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's -- I -- I missed part of it too.  I was kind of distracted at the moment.  I was looking the other way and I kind of caught it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I [LAUGH] know, it's [MN] --
L:  But, uh, it was something to the effect of has it changed your attitude towards your marriage and -- and how you think about your marriage, and how you feel about it.
R:  Okay.  Well, I'm not married so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  +Oh, so that makes it a little bit more difficult.
R:  Um, so has -- what about you?  Has it changed the, um ...
L:  Well, we've been married, let's see.  Twenty -- let me think here.  I got married in eighty, so twenty three years.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  It's a long time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be with one person.  I -- I just never would have thunk.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I waited.  I didn't get married until I was, oh gosh, I guess, twenty four or so.  
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, I always figured once I got in it, [LIPSMACK] it was going to be the right one, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So I did.  I waited.  You know, and it just -- I knew so many kids when I was in high school that got married right out of high school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And most of 'em are divorced now.
R:  Right.
L:  And I [SIGH] -- I mean, gosh, I don't even know that many people that have been married that long.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  You know, a few, but to me it's real important.  Um, it's like so many people I know just seem to think, well, you know, it's no big deal if it doesn't work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we'll just get a divorce and try over again.  It's like, [MN] I don't understand that logic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you know, Rick and I we have a lot of problems at times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we work through 'em.  
R:  Right.  I mean, even though I'm not married it's still [MN] the divorce rate, you know, it's increasing.  It just makes -- it makes me [MN] almost scared, you know, to -- to make a decision --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and the fear it's not going to work out.  But, um, I -- I do --
L:  Well, it's so easy to get a divorce now.
R:  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I -- I mean I have friends that -- I mean I have graduated, and I have friends that got married right after they graduated high school and, I mean, they're divorced now and it -- it just -- I mean, it really makes me scared that I think it's -- it's [MN] --
L:  Makes you more cautious?
R:  Right.  Makes me m- much more cautious.  But I --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- think -- I think a lot, um, that [several inaudible words] my parents actually twenty fifth anniversary this year and, um, I mean, I know -- I -- I think that just a lot of people, since it is so easy to get a di- a divorce, it's, you know, it doesn't seem like it's that big of a deal if it doesn't work out, or whatever.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm in no rush and I -- I'm -- I'm -- I really think that when I do make the decision it's going to be one forever and I -- I don't know it's -- it's -- [MN] if you don't really -- it's not a big issue about falling in love and falling out of love.  I think it's -- a lot of it, um, comes down to commitment after a while.  You know, it's, um -- I -- we learn that awhile back.  I'm -- I'm real big in church and, um, one of our [inaudible] lessons was about that and about marriage and about, you know, you might not really feel like you love the other person for a while but, you know, it's all about the commitment that's made a while back.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, things worked out so ...  I mean -- I mean, it makes me scared to make a commitment because, I mean, it almost makes me [MN] -- I'm really cautious about my spouse -- my future spouse and if -- if -- if their family has -- was divorced, if they're going to think the same way I do about the commitment thing or if they're going to think it's no big deal to get divorced.  But I think that'll all, you know, be part of the factor -- um, it'll be the factor of my, you now, deciding that they're the one and [several inaudible words] a lot of their views on divorce and stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm probably making no sense at all.  But, um, yeah, it -- it -- it does make -- it makes me a lot more cautious.  Um, but I -- I mean, I'm not -- I'm not too scared, um, to, you know, make a commitment but it does make me a -- a lot -- a lot more cautious.
L:  It makes you think about it a little bit longer, you know.  Make sure --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um -- you know, like I said, [MN] I know if I weren't -- I would not want to be a single person now.  
R:  Right.
L:  Not in this day and age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know and -- and I guess that's another reason why, for me, it's important that we make this work.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I mean, we've had our rough spots over the years.  I -- you know, I know there was one time a long time ago when we hadn't been married [MN] a year or two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] -- well, probably about a year.  And we went through a really rough time and thought a divorce was just way up there, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  But, um, it's like, okay, you know.  This -- this is ridiculous.  We've got to change.  We've got to work it out together.
R:  Right.
L:  We've got to figure out something to do that makes it work for both of us.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And we worked through it.  It was hard, but we did and a lot of it was because I knew so many people that were divorced and they were unhappy and ...
R:  Right.
L:  And then they were out just, you know -- I've never really gotten into the bar scene that much.  I mean, when I was younger, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- eighteen to early twenties, you know.  Yeah, we went to the bars and stuff.  But I don't think I'd want to marry one of the guys that I met at the bars out there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- drinking every night, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just not my thing and I didn't want to have to get into that again.  And I saw what a lot of my friends went through with their divorces and how spiteful they could be --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and hateful towards each other.  And I -- I just never understood that, you know.  How can you love somebody and then six months later totally not love them?  And --
R:  Right.
L:  And be so negative towards them.  It just made no sense to me.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And I don't remember what the second question was since we've been talking.
R:  No.  I don't remember either. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I know --
L:  I knew it right at the start but I've -- I can't think of what it was now.  
R:  Mhm.  Uh ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  But, I mean, I just wanted to let you know that people like you that have been married for such a long time are such an encouragement.  Like just to --
L:  Well, good.
R:  -- to know, you know, that people do work it out.  You know, it's -- I mean, you know, it's just -- I have a lot of friends who's parents are divorced and, you know, I -- it -- and it's a bit discouraging, but then to see somebody like you, or my parents, that have been married for, you know, over twenty years is just such an -- such an encouragement.  And, you know, it just -- it -- it gives me a better feeling about it.  You know, that --
L:  Can you hold on just one second?  
R:  Mm.
L:  That's my other line.
R:  Sure.
L:  Okay.  Sorry.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  No, that's fine.  Um, but I -- I just thought I'd let you know that.
L:  Well, that's good.  I'm -- I'm glad to hear it.  Um, 'cause honestly I don't know many people that have been married as long as I have been.  As a matter of fact, this is my first marriage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I am my husband's fourth marriage to his -- no, fourth -- fifth marriage to his fourth wife.  Because he married one of his wives twice.  And I saw what he went through with them too.  Course they all had, well two of them had had children with him.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, [MN] it was awful what he went through.  I mean, like the one -- the one had told him, you know, well -- and she's the one that divorced him.  But she had told him, you know, "My main objective in my life is to make your life miserable".  
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]  And [MN] literally when I mar- when I married him their son was eight years old -- as a matter of fact that was him on the phone right now.  He was calling to let me know they just got back from Six Flags.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] he's thirty two now, something like that.  I believe thirty one, something like that.  And until the boy turned eighteen she did her best to make life miserable for us.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And it was just, you know, just like how can you be so spiteful.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she was.  I mean she was just awful about it.  Now his other ex wife, they had two kids together, and she and I were friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, that -- that one was okay.  
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, the first one -- I guess that -- she was another reason why it was like, "I don't want to get divorced.  I don't want --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- to have to go through this.  I don't want those feelings".  I just -- I just can't understand it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So watching -- I think that's probably what made me more determined to stick things out.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, the only other time my husband and I ever really had problems was -- we were married nine years before we had our son.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was probably not too long after he was born, you know, probably a year or two years, we went through some pretty rough times too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the thought, you know, of course it crossed my mind but it was like, "No, I'm not going to do it", you know. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  We'll just have to work on it just like we worked on it last time.  You know, and -- and now things are great.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I think a lot of people they, um, just they don't want to work through the problems but, I mean, it always seems that -- I mean, people that have stayed together, I mean, it's [MN] -- it's obvious that they don't have a problem free marriage, you know.  I mean, I don't know if anybody has a problem free marriage but --
L:  I don't know of anybody that does.  
R:  Right.
L:  And it's -- I'm -- there's people -- I -- I -- I just really think it's a commitment thing.  It's -- it's
