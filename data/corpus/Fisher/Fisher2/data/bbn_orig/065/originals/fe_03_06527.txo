L:  Hi, my name is Cynthia.
R:  What did you say your name was?
L:  Cynthia.
R:  Cynthia?
L:  What's yours?
R:  Anna.
L:  Hi Anna, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Good.
R:  As far as this --
L:  So --
R:  -- thing that we're supposed to be doing today, I agree with it.  That they should be able to do it.
L:  I do too.  I -- I totally agree.  I feel that a --a company has the right to request that their, um, employees follow what they -- their standards and -- and if they want a drug test, then I think it's a great idea.
R:  I do too.  Because when you take a job; this is my opinion, you're no longer, um, doing something for yourself.  You're working for somebody; that means you get -- you're taking money from this company.  You have to still live up to their standards.  And you as an employee are showing that company's standards.
L:  I agree.  I totally agree.  And I think I --
R:  Do you work out of the home?
L:  Not any more.  I -- I used to but I don't now.  How about you?
R:  I do but right now I can't because I'm off from a car accident.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
R:  That's okay.  I'm ready to go back.  It was a year ago and I'll find out this next week.
L:  Oh, great.  Well, good luck with that.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, did the -- did the employer that you worked for -- was it a place where they, um, did random drug testing?
R:  Oh, yeah, they do.  Yep.  My husband, he works, um, out of the home and he works for a big company and they do it too.
L:  Yeah, my husband --
R:  So does my son.
L:  -- my co- -- husband's company does it and, um, they'll pull him in or anybody in and just say, you know, they'll be there waiting for him when he -- he travels out of town for them and when he comes in they'll -- they'll be waiting for people and say, "Okay, you need to go and give us a sample".  And I mean --
R:  No problem.
L:  -- they know that and tha- -- and they know that's -- they knew -- he knew that when he took the job and -- and I -- I think that's totally the right way to do things.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know if I owned a big -- a big company or any company, even a small company I would want to make sure my apl- -- employees were coming to work alert and not under the influence of anything.
R:  Very true.  I used to manage a restaurant and I was there -- I did this for fifteen years at the same place.  And I only had to send one waitress home.  And I told her she needed to go home and find herself because she was so drunk.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I don't know if she was on drugs too.  I said when you bring back your blood test from the hospital we will consider your job here.
L:  Oh, that was great.  So, did -- did she not just come back?
R:  She just didn't come back.
L:  Yeah, I figured.  And, you know, you don't want that type of employee.  It doesn't --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- look -- it doesn't look good.  I mean, when you're serving the public and customers, they don't want to come in and be waited on by people that just don't have their full facilities.  [MN] 
R:  That was just not right.
L:  No.  Not at all.
R:  I just couldn't believe she even came to work like that.  
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  I've never been around people like that so, I was, like, [SIGH] okay, you need to go home.
L:  Yeah.  I -- yeah, I -- I -- I -- 
R:  Have you ever worked around people that are on drugs?
L:  Thank goodness, no.  I -- my job, I used to work with kids [LAUGH] all the time, young kids and --
R:  Oh, thank God.
L:  -- um, I was -- yeah.  And I was lucky that I didn't have to deal with that.  We, um, actually educated the kids.  We had people come in and talk to them about the dangers of using drugs and, um, [LIPSMACK] so, thank goodness I didn't have to experience what you did because I think it'd be really difficult because some people can get so belligerent.  But, you know, I -- I praise you for being able to, you know, stand up to them and tell her -- tell her to go home.  That was good.
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you care how [inaudible] how -- if I ask how old you are?
L:  Sure.  I'm forty seven.  How about you?
R:  I'm thirty eight.  I'll be thirty nine next week.  And how old are your children?
L:  My daughter's twenty five.  How about you?  How many do you have?
R:  Mine just turned twenty one on Monday.  And I have a fifteen year old, eleven year old and ten year old.
L:  Wow!  You have your hands full.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you -- you've talked and touched on these issues a lot with your kids.
R:  Oh, [MN] you'd think?  Hm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] Oh, yeah. 
L:  You know, that -- 
R:  It -- 
L:  -- I think that --
R:  -- it's an everyday issue with us.  I mean I've got --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- such a difference in the age and the time span here.
L:  Well, when my daughter was in high school it was, um, I mean, we always talked a- -- openly about this because I did work with kids at a boys and girls club actually and, um, so my daughter and I had a lot of discussions about drug use and everything.  So, she thank goodness had m- made the choice that she wasn't going to do it.  But it, you know, peer pressure was really hard and there were a lot of --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- kids that were -- that were doing it and, um, [LIPSMACK] and -- and would come to school under the influence.  And I -- I just never understood why -- I thought the sch- -- you know, number one, the parents should have noticed something.  But if they're not then the school should have been stepping up and -- and doing something about it.
R:  Very true.  And I do also believe on the lines of, um, employers drug testing.  I do believe that they should be able to do drug testings for the students.  
L:  Oh, I do too.  I -- I -- 
R:  Because if they --
L:  -- don't think that -- 
R:  -- got 'em at a younger age and knew that they had an addiction problem, they may have stopped it before they became adults and were addicted 
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  Do you understand what I'm saying?
L:  I know exactly what you're saying.  But you know, our society has become so [SIGH] I don't even, I mean, everybody sues for everything these days and -- and teachers are afraid to do anything with kids.  And -- and say the wrong thing and --
R:  Well, we as --
L:  -- and -- 
R:  -- parents of this nation, we need to step up to this.  Say. "Hey, we gotta [several inaudible words] or, um, control of our children's behavior back".  [MN] 
L:  Well, th- that's true.  Because well, you know, the kids are the future of this country and -- and look -- look what's happening.  I mean, look at the way our world's going.  Look at kids think nothing about shooting each other.  I mean, that hasn't nothing to do with drug testing but it's just the same thing.  But if, um, you know, if we took control of our children, and gave 'em some values, and -- and led 'em down the right road, and didn't let them think that they had all these rights; that no one had the right to send 'em home from school, and no one has the right to tell them what they can and can't do.  I don't know.
R:  Well, mine don't have that opinion, they know.  
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry?
R:  I said my kids don't have that opinion, they know.
L:  Well, that's good.  You've done a great job raising them then.
R:  [several inaudible words] [LIPSMACK] well the twenty one year old's the only one that's mine, [LIPSMACK] uh, that I gave birth to.  The other three are my step children.  But I've had them in my life since the youngest one was in diapers.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I've always had them here.  They still live with their mom; we get 'em on the weekends and for holidays.  And I love them just as if they were mine.
L:  That's nice.
R:  And I punish 'em just like I would mine.
L:  You know, I think they respect you and they love you when --
R:  They do.
L:  -- they do that.  I -- I don't think kids respect or love their parents when -- when they don't make their mind and follow rules.  My daughter, you know, we -- we batted heads all the time and -- and now that she's twenty five, she'll say, you know, mom looking back, thank you very much.  At the time I know I -- I was hard to deal with at times but I really know you were looking out for me and I really appreciate you being so strict with me.  And it means a lot to hear that now that she is, you know, a grown woman and --
R:  Yep.   And a lot of these companies, their employers they do these drug tests and if it does come back positive it's not an automatic, um, firing on the spot any more.  
L:  Oh, it isn't?
R:  No.  What it -- they do is they make 'em go through counseling.  [PAUSE] It's their way of saying, okay.  'Specially if this has been a full time employee for many years 
L:  Mhm.
R:  They make 'em go to counseling for it.  Take some time off to deal with the issues.  And then they'll let 'em come back to work, which is more than a lot of 'em will.
L:  Well, you know, I think that's great but I -- I kind of believe, okay, we'll give you one tr- -- chance of this.  And if -- if you don't make it work then I think there's no problem -- I would have no problem saying then you're out of here.  And I think that's the right of an employer to say.  You know, we'll send you to counseling and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if it doesn't work, then sorry you're going to have to look for another job.  I mean, I think that's more than fair.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know if I was an employer, if I'd even want to be that fair, which I haste to admit but ...
R:  Where do you live at now?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Tennessee.  How 'bout you?
R:  I'm in Michigan.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yeah.  I am from the blue collar state where there's a lot of factory workers in this -- in this state.--
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not just in local communities but Michigan is based on th- -- the big three, uh, auto --
L:  Mhm.  So, I guess 'specially in th- -- in that state, uh, you probably hear a lot about drug t- -- I mean, I'm sure all the --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the drug manufacturers automatically just --
R:  Yes.  We do hear --
L:  -- implement this. 
R:  -- a lot of it.  And I'm sure --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's a lot of it being done.  I don't see it.  I don't hear about it personally.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I hope to God the kids aren't.  But we do have to deal with these issues on a day to day basis so that we bring it up a lot.
L:  That's great.
R:  I don't want it to be a big surprise for them.  I mean, I still have to get educated on what these new drugs are.  And they're like --
L:  [MN] Well, it -- 
R:  -- like, what are you taking?  What are you talking about?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it's unbelievable.  I mean, in -- in my day, you know, you didn't have to worry about going out to a club and having somebody drop something in your drink and --
R:  No.  
L:  I know, I me- -- 
R:  You never event though about having to carry your drink around with you.  You get up --
L:  No. 
R:  -- you leave your drink, sh- -- everything right where you're at.  Go back --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- everything, you know, it's still there.  [NOISE] You weren't worried about it.
L:  That's true.
R:  [COUGH] And you weren't, uh, not --
L:  It's -- it's just [inaudible] it --
R:  -- but that's more on the lines of [PAUSE] kids are what they learn.
L:  That's true.  That's very true.
R:  And these people that are doing these kind of things; they have picked it up from someplace.  And it's not an overnight issue.
L:  No, it isn't.  This has started years ago with --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- how they were parented.  I really don't like that.  How their -- how their children -- how their parents --
R:  Called home training.
L:  -- brought them up.   I mean, somebody has to take responsibility and -- and I think that's half the problem.  Everybody wants to blame somebody else and -- and it's real easy to say well, you know, you're +infringing +upon my rights as an American and blah, blah, blah.  And -- and you have no right to -- to, um, invade my privacy and drug test me and blah, blah, blah.   But [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Are you there?
L:  -- if you want them --
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Are you there?
L:  Yes, I am.  Did you [inaudible] -- did we lose each other?
R:  Uh?
L:  I can hear you.  Can you hear me?
R:  Yes, I can.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  I hear --
L:  So -- 
R:  -- a beep, that's why I thought that was them answer- -- um, chiming in on our conversation all ready.   And I thought, okay, we're not done yet are we?
L:  [LAUGH] --
