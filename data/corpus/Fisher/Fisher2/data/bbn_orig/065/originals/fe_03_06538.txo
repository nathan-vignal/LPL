R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello, how you doing?
L:  Hi, I'm Erica.
R:  Hi, my name is Jam, I live in South Florida.
L:  I'm in, ah, Phoenix.
R:  Okay, that's a nice area.
L:  [LAUGH] Kind of hot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but yeah, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- good.
R:  [SIGH] Well, our topic today -- well, I've had the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah -- ah -- easier time talking on other ones there were -- there were, I felt, much more to talk about, but this one has to do with, ah, should companies test for drugs?
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I feel that they should. [LAUGH] You know, I feel that um, if I was an employer, I wouldn't want to hire somebody, who had, um, you know, tested positive for using ah cocaine or heroin or -- or even marijuana.
L:  Or crystal meth.
R:  Or whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just went through an experience with someone who was using crystal meth.  Um, yeah, I -- I s- -- I -- I support it.  I -- I don't think it's an invasion of privacy.  If you're paying my salary, you have the right to know that while I'm [SIGH] working for you that I am drug free and --and won't endanger myself by being, ah, intoxicated and injure myself on the job.  I know that [LIPSMACK] automatically now, if you have any kind of uh injury while you're on the job, the first thing they do is send you to a lab for a drug test. 
R:  [SIGH] Oh yeah.
L:  To make sure that's not, you know, why you injured yourself.
R:  I wasn't aware --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- of -- aware of that, I didn't know that they could make take a blood test. [SIGH] I guess I thought te- -- in terms more of um, you know, initially before they hired you.
L:  Yeah, well he said -- they said random drug testing, which, um -- I've worked for companies that that was the policy that, theoretically, that they could randomly drug test if they suspected, um, there were drug use, they could randomly test their employees, um. 
R:  Did they have to sign a waiver at the time they were hired, that they would su- ah submit to a random [NOISE] drug test?  And are they --
L:  I think so --
R:  -- to be terminated?
L:  -- yeah, I think that -- yeah, I think that was a condition of employment.  I do, I do.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And I don't -- I don't -- I -- I just don't think it's an invasion of privacy, I don't.  I think once someone's paying you a salary that, you know, they have the right to know that you're not using illegal drugs, 'cause it can affect your work.  I -- I ju- -- you know 
R:  Right, [SIGH] and I also --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think that anything that makes it more difficult for people to use drugs, and if that's one of the ways, then that's a good thing.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Everytime --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I see that, ah, "We don't hire, you know -- if you use drugs, don't bother applying because we don't hire people who do" --
R:  [SIGH] My only question --
L:  -- and I think --
R:  -- on -- my only question on that is that someone can abuse alcohol, [SIGH] so are what --
L:  Oh, unfortunately, that's the --
R:  -- are the limitations on it?
L: -- unfortunately that's legal, unless you're, you know, intoxicated on the job.  I um, -- in my personal situation where I had to drug test my ex-spouse, um, yeah he tested positive for alcohol during a time period when he had our child with him and that wasn't, you know -- even though it was, you know, off the wall high, it still wasn't the basis for anything, in the court's opinion, so [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- unfortunately we  that -- that is still legal even though it's a drug.  So unless you're -- unless you're using it on the job -- now if it's, you know -- if you injure yourself and you're intoxicated, I understand it's the same as [NOISE] having used a illegal drug, as far as they're concerned but 
R:  Or if they're driving o- over the -- over the legal limit, alcohol limit a- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he has a child with him. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause there was something like that in Florida recently, where um, you know, somebody was doing that but he ne- -- he was -- ah actually in one of our ah government agencies that was supposed to be looking out for kids --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- and he had -- he had his daughter with him and he was stopped and -- for um drunken driving and the child was in the car. [LAUGH]
L:  You know I -- yeah -- I think I just [inaudible] -- wasn't that on the news recently?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well --
L:  I -- I think I saw --
R:  -- it --
L:  -- a clip about someone who was part of a -- [NOISE] of a task force to cut back on something and --
R:  Child [NOISE] abuse or something like that.
L:  -- like that, was -- yeah, yeah.
R:  It was -- I thought it was just in our local news though [SIGH] --
L:  Mm, no I thought I saw --
R:  -- down here.
L:  -- I thought -- well, it could've been on CNN.  I just saw a clip somewhere, as I was channel surfing at one point.
R:  [MN] [SIGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Now, I think if they're randomly testing for drugs, and someone, um, tests positive after they're already employed, [SIGH] I think maybe they might j- -- instead of just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- terminating them, giving them an option of like, uh employee assistance --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and counseling and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, to give them a chance --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and maybe, like -- and then, you know, still test them afterwards and see how they're doing.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] and then you get into the problems of, ah, you know -- the size of the company.  You know some companies couldn't afford to do that, you know, smaller companies --
R:  Well --
L:  -- couldn't afford to be maintaining employees 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who -- while they're going through assistance.  You know, if they're not -- see now, I know where I worked when they did it, they would do random drug testing that, [NOISE] um -- they would do random drug testing and that combined [NOISE] with any problem on the job, like if you were getting low ratings or if you were, um, [NOISE] if you'd been on corrective action, or [NOISE] if you had a high rate of absenteeism, those two things combined could be a reason to be terminated.  [NOISE] Yet there was, ah, if you test positive [NOISE] and there weren't any, um, [NOISE] performance related issues, [NOISE] they would, um, refer you to counseling and work with you on that sort of thing.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they had a [NOISE] -- they had a different, um, protocol depending on your --
R:  Right.
L:  -- your work record. 
R:  [SIGH] How -- how --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- often would they -- +often would they test randomly, like once --
L:  Well --
R:  -- a year, or ?
L:  -- [NOISE] well, um, you -- you just didn't know, and they didn't do it often, so my -- my feeling was that, um, you know, wh- when they suspected something might be going on, they -- they, you know, so called randomly did it, and -- but I don't know.  I don't know what the basis was 'cause it was not predictable. [NOISE] And I -- and I never had it occur.  [NOISE] Um, I had been tested prior to being hired, but um, I was never, you know, one of the random [SIGH] candidates during my employment, so it never happened to me, but I know [NOISE] if you injure yourself -- my sister worked at a shoe store as assistant manager and she [NOISE] was just like, you know, sitting like, in a catcher's position, you know kinda squatted down --
R:  Right.
L: -- and sh- -- and she lost her balance and just kinda tipped over backwards [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they [LAUGH] sent her -- they immediately sent her to a lab to get her -- her urine tested, for drugs. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh wow. [LAUGH] Wh- --
L:  So, I think that was a bit overkill, but 
R:  Well, is that what they al- -- 'cause I think every employer makes you do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like a urine test.  I -- I -- even years ago --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I worked for the postal service and had been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- working there for fifteen years.  I wonder if back to then if -- if that's what that was for, I -- I guess --
L:  [NOISE] Hold up.  Oh, no!  Sorry, my dog's setting his teeth at my cat.  Um, I don't know --
R:  Is that always -- is -- that's always for drugs, or not, or ?
L:  I don't -- you know, I -- I don't know.  Some of it -- some of it's got to do with your health insurance.  Like if you get hired and you're going to be added to their group insurance, they might do, um [NOISE], you know, urine tests just to, you know, pick up anything, [NOISE] I think I know that.  Krystal[?], [several inaudible words].  [NOISE] Thank you.  Anyway, so I don't know for sure, but I know that that's one of the things that they -- they did.  Some of the companies was it had to do with getting, um, on their group health --
R:  Right.
L: -- cover, rather then testing for drugs.  But --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- bottom line, I don't think it's a big deal.  I don't think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, if you're not using drugs, then it's not an issue and if you are using illegal drugs, anyone [NOISE] that's -- is paying you the salary has the right to know that, you know? [MN]
R:  Yeah.  One other question --
L:  Yeah I --
R:  -- I have is about the cigarette smoking then, if they can ah -- ah disqualify you for that, although I know it's legal to smoke cigarettes, everybody knows that it's going to cause, uh, a financial burden, in medical costs --
L:  Yeah, I don't think they do that, that's -- yeah, that's not considered a drug --
R:  But I --
L:  -- unfortunately. To- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nicotine, tobacco's not considered a drug, at this point anyway. [SIGH] Or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at least I- -- if -- if it is, it's a legal one.
R:  Right.
L:  So, nobody tests you for that.  I don't think they're allowed to ask you that either.
R:  Oh whether you smoke or not?
L:  Yeah.  Smoke cigarettes, I -- I don't know, I don't think so. 
R:  Hm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Unless, I know you're -- I -- well, yeah, they don't ask you if you smoke or not, but they can tell you not to smoke on the property or something like that.
L:  Right, right, yeah, you know, they can tell you where you can smoke --
R:  Right, like d- --
L:  -- or -- or tell you can't smoke at all.  There is -- there are -- I do know some people who work for companies where you -- you can only sm- smoke off [NOISE] site during -- before and after -- or during your lunch break, but 
R:  Huh. [SIGH]
L:  But not too many.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  But I guess we, you know -- it's hard to get a re- -- lively discussion going when you both agree that [LAUGH] they should be able to do it.  I wonder who would dis- -- well, I know it's a civil liberties issue; some people think it's an invasion of privacy. [MN] 
R:  Oh you think it --
L:  And --
