R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Charlotte.
R:  I'm Ethan.
L:  Hi.
R:  I didn't get the, um, what, um, the, um, topic of the day was, excuse me.
L:  Ah, yeah, I believe it was how the divorce rates have affected.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  Divorce rates.  I think they're way too high in the United States.
L:  Yeah, I think it's too easy, you know.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  People can get --
R:  I think it's --
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  I think there should be marriage counselling for people who go through a divorce before they go through an actual divorce.  That way they reconsider a lot of factors because --
L:  Right.
R:  They may sti- still actually be in love and or maybe some problems with them.
L:  Right.  And it's just like I said, it's too easy.  Too many people just get married too quickly and, you know, relatively inexpensive.  I mean, if they go to a Justice Of The Peace or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then, um, it's just easy to get married and then the first time something goes wrong, then they want a divorce.
R:  Yeah.  It -- you can't go into a marriage thinking that everything is going to go perfect.  You just have to accept that there's another person and you have to look out for that per- person, your spouse or -- because if you don't, then -- and a lot of people can't do that and are not used to that kind of environment where they have to look out for other people than themselves.
L:  Right, and then there's a lot of children involved where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have, you know, just the mother or the father and, ah, left in the household there's a lot of, you know, single parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's also, um, a lot of step parents, I mean, or boy friends or girl friends moved in the house which really affects the children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially --
R:  I feel sorry for the children.
L:  Yeah, especially if they have children of their own and then there's, you know, like mixed families.  This really affects -- you know, this really affects the family because like, say, the girlfriend is saying well, my children aren't doing it, your children are, and then the children are squabbling.  I've known different, ah, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Situations like that from friends.
R:  Yes.
L:  Right.
R:  I just think there should be some kind of guidelines for people who go through divorce that they go through a process of marriage counselling, so, yeah, it should be more restricted in that form --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because you don't want to go through life finding that perfect person when you already have them.  It's just -- it -- there's just some things that that person does or says that makes you angry or -- sometimes.
L:  Well, that's a -- I've been married now going on thirty three years and there's a lot of ups, there's a lot of downs, but, you know, you have to be committed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You just can't run out the first time something goes wrong.
R:  Yes.
L:  Run, find a -- a new partner the minute something goes wrong.  It's just something you have to be committed in.
R:  Yes.  You have -- marriages and commitment, and you want to be ready for that commitment.
L:  Right, and it does affect, you know, um, children.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They feel they could be -- they -- they don't want to side with one parent or another.
R:  Yes.
L:  It's been very difficult for some of our friends who have, you know, gotten a divorce.
R:  Yes.
L:  And the children feel lost.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's been -- like I said, it's been very difficult for them because they don't know what side to choose and, um, --
R:  And they're more like- more likely to divorce after their parents' divorce.
L:  That's a goo- -- yeah, that's a good point.
R:  They got all these problems and emotions inside of them and they don't know how to deal with that.
L:  And they feel it's normal that they've seen divorce.
R:  Yes.
L:  And they think, "Well, it's okay".
R:  Right, it's their fault and it's not their fault, it's their parents' fault, not theirs.
L:  Right.  And like I said also then they feel well, it's a normal thing.  I mean, divorce, that they see their parents getting a divorce, then when they're in a marriage themselves and things don't go right, then they feel well it's okay to get a divorce too, but it's just acceptable, rather than holding on and trying to be committed.  I have known people -- well, my boss, for instance, ah, she and her husband have been married almost forty seven years.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and, um, like she said, just, you're in there -- once you make that decision, you're in there for better or for worse and it isn't always easy.  But, ah, it also -- how it affects people.  Lots of times if a person, you know, a couple who are getting divorced, a lot of times say the woman has to go on welfare and that affects all of us as we know because then we're helping to support the families, sometimes the husband or the wife --
R:  Yes.
L:  Whoever makes the most money is not maybe contributing to --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to child support or that, and it -- it does make it very difficult.
R:  Sometimes, yeah, it's not right.
L:  No, it isn't.
R:  Because sometimes, hm, divorce is really messy.  I was watching this movie about this woman who was getting divorced and she had to move out of her hus- husband's house and she hired a hit man so, and she eventually got caught but --
L:  Is that the --
R:  Eventually everyone was the victim.
L:  Right.  Was that the one with Meredith Baxter running?  I saw that.
R:  What?
L:  I saw the movie with Meredith Bax- -- Meredith Baxter Burney[?] in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I noticed like that one, I mean, she wound up killing her husband and his new wife.  It, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was really bad.  It was based on a true story also, um, and her children.  He took the children and, um, it was very messy.  It usually, you know --
R:  It is a battle over the house or the assets and everything.  It's not any kind of agreement.  It -- worse than the marriage itself.
L:  Well, that's it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  People need to stick with it, and it does affect everyone, the children and how they view commitments.
R:  When you get married you need to think of commitment and that you should be committed to that person.
L:  I have to -- and they just don't have the same values as they used to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know how old you are but I don't know if you remember, um, the old series like Father Knows Best and --
R:  No, I'm not that old.
L:  Yeah, see, I am.  I'm already fifty five so I remember these as I grew up, and it was -- families were committed then, and I think they were closer.
R:  I --
L:  They did more things together.
R:  Yeah.  That would be nice if more families did -- were closer and, yeah, together, like --
L:  Ah, that's the whole thing.  Like I said, it's, um, they need more commitment and to do -- have more family unity to, you know --
R:  Yes, more family unity because a lot of families today are just, ah, there was this commercial where the family was just going berserk or yeah.
L:  Oh, I saw that one, yes.
