R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
L:  Hello. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, I'm Kevin.
L:  I'm Kate, hi.
R:  Kate?
L:  Kate, yeah.
R:  Hi, good to meet you.
L:  Yeah, nice to meet you. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Uh --
L:  Um.  So we're talking about [NOISE] divorce and if it's affected our lives and things like that, is that what the topic is?
R:  I heard it affected, ah -- if it affects our, ah, um, our behaviour.
L:  Right.
R:  And what was the other part?
L:  Um, [NOISE] I -- I don't -- I don't really remember I -- it went kinda quick and I didn't really hear what they said.  Um, I guess, ah, yeah, I dunno, a family -- something about family values, too, um, [LIPSMACK] not really sure.  Anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I guess I was kinda [NOISE] su- surprised, I didn't know that -- that divorce rate was still rising, I thought maybe it was [NOISE] -- it sort of settled down.
L:  Yeah, I thought it was um, pretty much at about fifty per cent, at -- at least in the US, and um, it's not -- it's not as, you know, high in other places, which is interesting I think, um, [NOISE] I dunno, and um -- I dunno if it had -- like what it really has to do with, um, 'cause I think a lot of factors, you know, especially like religion and um, domestic violence, things like that, [NOISE] um, yeah, I dunno. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I -- I don't think the -- a- at least for myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it re- really doesn't  um, doesn't really matter, I mean, I've never married, but --
L:  Mhm, yeah, me neither, so. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I, ah, fall into a pretty, um, rare category, 'cause um, there's not very many men in their forties who've never married --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um, [LIPSMACK] but [SIGH] um, [NOISE] I don't know how  [SIGH] it -- it actually is kind of interesting, 'cause I'm really not sure how much of a -- a [MN] [COUGH] -- family values [LIPSMACK] um, that is, I mean, a lot of people who end up in divorce, I mean it -- it's probably a better thing --
L:  Right, exactly, yeah --
R:  -- especially, you know, ra- rather --
L:  -- definitely.
R:  -- than the idea of, you know, sticking it through for children or something like that.  It's --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- it -- it probably be healthier than to -- than to raise children in an unhealthy --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- relationship.
L:  Yeah, it makes things a lot worse if there's always that whole --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, tension and everything like that. [SIGH] I dunno, I mean, um, I'm a -- I'm a student and both -- both my parents are ah, they're still together, but a lot of my friends have divorced parents, and ah, I dunno it's [several inaudible words] for a kid sometimes, but I think it -- it usually [NOISE] ends up being better, you know, I dunno --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, and --
L:  --if -- if the parents are happy too.
R:  -- and -- and I also think that, um, I'm not sure -- +quite sure that, um, it is a -- um, an issue because I think that -- that society is much different than it was [SIGH] in the past --
L:  Yeah definitely.  Definitely ah --
R:  -- I mean if -- you know, I mean a hundred years ago [NOISE] you know, people only lived to be fifty years old anyway --
L:  Right --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- exactly.
R:  -- their life was pretty simple, you know you grow up and you live on a farm and you build a house and --
L:  [LAUGH] Ri- right.
R:  -- just raise family and -- you know what I'm saying, and there's -- there's a certain stability to that. 
L:  Right.
R:  But in today's w- w- world, [SIGH] um, [NOISE] you know I don't -- I -- I th- -- I think there's just so much more opportunity --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think it's just a natural thing for human beings to be curious and wanna try out different things.
L:  Right, yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I dunno, I mean, I dunno how much -- yeah, definitely has to do with like, um, more like career options, things like that, um, I dunno.  [LAUGH] It has to do with a lot of things, [LAUGH] but um, yeah I dunno, I think it's in- -- I think it's also intr- interesting to look at the +divorce ra- -- before the div- divorce rates here in the US and the divorce rates other places and why they're, you know, different, or not -- not different --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.  But --
R:  I wouldn't kn- -- but yeah, that is interesting.  I don't know why that [SIGH] might be, other than maybe there -- it's still [MN] -- you know, we are [SIGH] such a diverse society and so many other countries are, you know, more [NOISE] homogeneous and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] um, [NOISE] -- um, I don't know too -- I'd be kinda curious to kinda know like, if the age of getting married has an effect. 
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  I've -- I suspect --
L:  -- that's true also.
R:  -- that if you -- younger [NOISE] [MN] -- marriages at a younger age are maybe less likely [SIGH] [NOISE] -- and I think maybe that goes back to what I was saying before is with all the opportunities, I don't think that people like even [SIGH] -- you know in their twenties, they still really don't even know what they want --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- or who they are --
L: Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and if they --
L:  So --
R:  -- get married and then they begin to grow and begin to discover and then they figure out that they're really not the match for each other.
L:  Right, exactly, yeah.  I think -- I think, yeah, mm, yeah with --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- so much, um, [LIPSMACK] emphasis on like, identity and things like that, you know, like I guess a marriage could change that, also, like, just a relationship could change a person and -- and things like that, so you know what I mean?  But yeah, I -- I dunno, I mean I don't think like [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, like we were saying before, I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, that -- that it's like a -- you know, it's like, "Oh no, our family values, like where are they going?" [LAUGH] You know, I don't think it's that at all really, I don't really  I don't know.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm not that concerned about it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah I'm not really -- definitely not -- [LAUGH] definitely not concerned about it, no.  But um, [NOISE] yeah, I dunno. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't really have many, you know, opinions on -- on this topic, so. [LAUGH] I dunno.
R:  [MN] [NOISE] [PAUSE] Probably um, you know, [NOISE] people on the, you know [NOISE] [SIGH] religious right --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- are probably the ones that are [SIGH] bringing it -- this up the most.
L:  Right, definitely.  Yeah, I think so.  But um, yeah -- yeah that definitely, and uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah they got the whole family values thing going.  Yeah I think it does have a lot to do with religion, in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in some places and I th- -- I mean I think like also in um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I dunno, in countries like, I dunno, maybe like Poland or something, where it's very -- very Catholic, like the -- the divorce rate's lower and things like that.  Um, it's kinda like who has control of the -- of the systems.  I dunno, things like that make a difference, I dunno.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  We're kind of exhausting our -- ah -- ah -- our views here, aren't we?
L:  Yeah exactly, I mean it's -- I dunno, I don't really 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't -- yeah I don't really have any ah, very strong views on divorce and uh -- and family values, per se. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I don't know, so  [PAUSE]  [NOISE]
R:  Have you had a long term relationship?
L:  Yeah, well I'm only, um, twenty right now, [LAUGH] I'm still -- um, I've -- I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, been in a long term relationship for about a year now, but other than that, not really, no.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And yeah, I dunno. [PAUSE]
R:  So you -- you don't really [NOISE] envision yourself as, like, husband hunting, at this point?
L:  [LAUGH] No, no, definitely not. [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- no, 'cause I -- I dunno I -- yeah, I mean like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like we were saying before, like there's a lot of things I wanna do that don't nec- -- you know don't necessarily involve marriage and having kids. [LAUGH] Definitely not until later, I feel like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, it's kinda like, if you wanna travel, which I probably would like to do, um, I dunno, you can't really -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know there's -- you know, there's -- there's issues like freedom, things like that, and -- yeah and you know, I still don't know really, you know, what I want, or who I am, whatever, you know, that whole thing [LAUGH] I guess so, [SIGH] yeah I dunno, so no I'm not like, you know, husband hunting or whatever. [LAUGH]
R:  So you sorta understood what I was saying before then, about like, yo- -- someone who is like twenty years old and they marry another person who's like twenty years old and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you could see, [SIGH] [NOISE] it -- it wouldn't be hard to imagine that, [SIGH] you know, seven years later, they'd be wanting to go off in different directions.
L:  Right, exactly, yeah.  It's very -- yeah, it's very easy to imagine that, so I dunno, yeah. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  You know, actually th- -- I guess if someone had that kind of foresight then it would be probably [SIGH] wise not to -- wise not to get married, and if they didn't maybe the divorce rate would be lower, maybe that would be a better thing, I dunno. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, I mean, I don't  yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, it's just kind --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of like one of those ah, like official statistics that -- I dunno, it doesn't seem like it means that much --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause people -- people like, you know, break up all the time, and if they had --
