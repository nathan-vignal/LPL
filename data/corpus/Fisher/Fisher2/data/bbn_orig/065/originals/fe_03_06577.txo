R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi I'm Caroline.
R:  I'm Lyn.
L:  Lyn?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah I've never done this before --
L:  I haven't either I was hoping I'd get somebody that had.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah I didn't know it was exactly like this where you just talk to somebody else that they picked to this.
L:  Well see I didn't know that at first either and then -- and then I finally figured it out, um, --
R:  Yeah -- yeah my, um, twin sister she's doing this you know and that so she asked if I wanted to do it and it was like well yeah I'm glad they caught me at a time when I wasn't busy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah I know my -- I have them up on my computer [inaudible] this is the first one they have been able to get me so.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Um, [inaudible] Illinois.
L:  Illinois -- I live in Kansas.
R:  Oh.
L:  So we're not too far apart.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So have you got sunshine right now? 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Yeah so do we.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was acting like it was going to be, um, rainy earlier and then it kind of changed then.
L:  We've had a lot of rain lately but, um, we needed it we were really dry.
R:  Oh, yeah we've got quite bit here kind of we've got a pond and it's getting pretty high where it was low for a long long time.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So I forgot what we're supposed to talk about.
L:  We're supposed to talk about family values and whether, um, the divorce rate in the United States has changed your opinion I think it was of -- of marriage.
R:  Yeah that's what I think I heard too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm glad you picked that up [inaudible] so fast I didn't do it.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was kind of nervous too, um, I don't know if it's changed my opinion but I think it's bad.  I think the divorce rate is bad.
R:  Yeah it is I mean, um, it's too quick now to define that so they're trying to work it out.
L:  Right and it's bad for the kids.
R:  Yeah very bad for them.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Fortunately I haven't had that I'm almost close to nineteen years now.
L:  Are you?
R:  June the second.
L:  Oh, my first time I -- I've been divorced but my first, um, anniversary was June first.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, I had three kids and my husband left me for another woman and it was not a pleasant thing.
R:  Yeah I can I can imagine that but [LAUGH] --
L:  Had to raise those kids by myself pretty much.
R:  Oh, right I bet that was hard.
L:  Yeah it was and -- but I -- I stayed home and did it.  I didn't get remarried again until just about seven years ago and, um, --
R:  Are your kids are grown and that?
L:  Yeah they were grown before I got married of course so I think that's better I -- you know I think it's kind of bad for kids to have step fathers and step mothers and 
R:  Yeah -- yeah sometimes that can be a problem, they think, "This isn't my dad" and then you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [inaudible] and stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  I was fortunate my mum and dad they've been -- let's see two thousand and two we had a fiftieth wedding anniversary for them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So and it's just turned fifty one years now this year --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's old since they're divorce hasn't really run through much in my family but, um, --
L:  Well --
R:  Somewhat but not a lot.
L:  It does in my family.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, my parents were divorced, my brother's divorced and I'm divorced and --
R:  Oh. 
L:  I don't know it pretty much runs in the family but, um, [inaudible] --
R:  Well the best thing to do is if you're not happy you know.
L:  Yeah, um, I think I heard the other day it's fifty -- I think it's fifty percent, one out of two you know that get -- yeah that gets divorced.
R:  Yeah they do.
L:  And the divorce rate is --
R:  Yeah that's pretty high.
L:  Yeah and you know they saw these kids don't even know you know who their parents are I mean I worked at [inaudible] and -- and that's -- there's so many different things that go on with the little kids life that.
R:  Yeah I agree -- shocked if we heard it all.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of what really goes on in the world.
L:  Oh, I think so too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's pretty bad.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And I don't know I mean as far as changing my opinion I -- I think people can -- can either make it or they can't I mean you know I think unless there's really some bad thing I think they can work through most problems if they just would.
R:  Yeah I think women have gotten more liberated than they have been -- they don't if depends on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the man and don't put up with stuff and that's why the divorce rate's probably higher too they're getting better jobs they can afford to support themselves and they don't have to depend on the man and you know that way they can say bye bye.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  And I know a lot of people disagree but I think you know women need to stay home and raise their kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they can possibly do it and I think they can if they will give up a few things.
R:  Yeah -- yeah I work -- I've been working for Wal-Mart for fifteen years and my kids are eighteen and twelve.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I did whenever they were growing up in that I just worked weekends.
L:  Oh. 
R:  And I figured that was good I got out of the house.
L:  Right.
R:  And my husband was able to participate.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  And whenever I'm there he doesn't participate.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know it was always like if the -- you know -- if the wife is there then it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- automatically her job and that and if I'm not there then he had to -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- step in.  You know.
L:  That's a good idea and I think you're a little younger than I am but, um, I think in my generation, um, -- um, -- the women pretty much took over the kids you knew that was just -- we thought that was our job -- I mean we didn't really give the men a chance to do it you know and -- and -- and I guess when the man works out and the woman does it is the woman's job.
R:  Yeah because that's what they do and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the man brings home the pay cheque.
L:  Right but I know now.
R:  But I've got -- I know I've got a husband where I work forty hours, he works forty hours but he still is in that mode that I'm supposed to do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all of this at home -- the cooking, the cleaning and the laundry everything and he doesn't think he has to help.  I can never get out of that situation.
L:  Well that's with my husband now is, um, retired and so I told him I said you know he -- he gave eight hours a day or nine hours a day but I didn't really gain anything by retiring cause I still have to cook and clean and --
R:  He doesn't help even after he's retired.  [LAUGH] Oh, boy.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah I'm sure I'll see that too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well mine actually he's got medically discharged from the Army National Guard cause he had a mild heart attack.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he's doing fine now but at forty one that happened he's got a lot and you know early age had that, um, but he's doing fine but anyway he got disabled out of the National Guard but then he found another job in the National Guard that really is right away and that and then you know -- but I'm sure if he could find something he'd be parked here and thinking well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't know I can't imagine him seeing me doing all of the work here and then but -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It happened to find that out.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But I don't know if I trust him to do the laundry and that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well yeah that's right too.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know I am kind of picky --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then it's like I never dare send him to the grocery store.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Because I'm into coupons and seeing sales and stuff like that.
L:  Are you a -- you're not on [inaudible] are you?
R:  No not my twin if that sounds familiar.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Well a lot of people -- that's where I got this on -- on there a lot said they had been talking to people that were -- that were on there.
R:  Yeah she is into the husband he works in Saint Louis and then she doesn't work and she's got time just like her own little business --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she just --
L:  That's what I do.
R:  -- everyday she [inaudible] go to get her mail and it's like I'm not I building junk mail.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But she's got her own little thing going.
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  She comes and gets my bar codes off stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah I do that to everybody too.  Well I guess I we might be getting off the subject and we might not get another call if we don't get back.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know exactly what we're supposed to talk -- I don't know what else we're supposed to talk about.
R:  Yeah it's like, um, --
L:  Well I do -- I -- you know I feel bad about the divorce rate I really --
R:  [inaudible] do really cause that's their opinion on -- you know -- you just try not to let it happen in your family I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As for my daughter she's going be going to be joining the Navy, um, in September and that and she's not so resistant -- more than it is in the Navy but you know he came back here and now she really relaxed and stuff and now his sister and his mum that she's winning her ring size --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it is like, "Oh, my god they're" -- you know [LAUGH] and it's I think back too whenever people get you know they're too young.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Don't experience -- they need to experience more before they get serious you know.
L:  Well you know it does seem like to me that -- that people are getting married a little later now though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know when -- when I was in high school I'm -- I'm sixty two and when -- when I got out of high school everybody just -- we just got married that was the thing to do I mean I graduated from high school in the end of may and got married the first of June I mean I -- we just thought that we got married and had kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah my mum she was eighteen when she got married and stuff but, um, -- 
L:  But now people --
R:  They wait I guess they live together where back then they didn't do that they just went and got married so.
L:  And you know some people think living together can help but it doesn't seem to if the divorce rate is still going up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I don't think they say that people that live it getter get just as many divorces as they did -- you know -- if they live together for a long time then get married then get a divorce.
R:  Yeah I don't know you would think after they live together for a while they'd know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what's going on not like you got married and then you're thinking, "Oh, that's what bad habits he's got".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  "I can't stand him now".
L:  Right.
R:  So I don't know what that is.
L:  I don't know either it just seems like after they get married that it -- it, um, --
R:  I don't know if they feel like they're trapped in and then they can't you know --
L:  I guess.
R:  I mean being together so long you know they ought to know if they want to be together for the rest of their lives.
L:  Yeah I guess.
R:  So
