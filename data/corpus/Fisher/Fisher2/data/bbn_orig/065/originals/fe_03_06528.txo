L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  
R:  Good.
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Who am I speaking with?
L:  My name is Toni.
R:  Hi Toni.  My name's Sandy.
L:  Nice meeting you.  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] yeah, I understand the topic of the day is how do you feel about drug testing?  Or what are your opinions on that?
R:  Um, I'm pro.  I'm very, very pro drug testing.  Um, my husband is a engineer for Bowington[?] Northern --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Mhm.
R:  -- and they have random drug tests al the time.  And, mm, I think it's just mandatory.
L:  [NOISE] Well, [NOISE] I -- I am -- also am pro [NOISE] because, uh, I -- I feel that -- I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, particularly on, uh, if you're on the job  and if you have a job that's involving safety issues or even your interacting with other people.  I mean, that's a [NOISE] concern if you're coming to work high, that's a problem.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, so I -- I don't -- I don't have a problem with it.  I know that there are many [NOISE] who think it's an invasion of privacy, but I don't have that -- share that feeling.
R:  I guess, it all -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I [MN] it almost sounds wrong --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I guess it kinda depends on the occupation, you know.  I -- I don't know.  I don't know that I'm pro drug use for any --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- occupation --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- however, I just -- I think that if you're --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in charge of a, uh, a hundred and twenty +car coal train and -- and other people's lives are depending on you, then yes in fact.
L:  Right.
R:  I think they have a right to know if you're, uh --
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] 
R:  -- if -- if you're under the influence of drugs.
L:  That's exactly where I get back -- living in a city where [NOISE] there has been an incident on public transportation roads and accidents and it's -- it has been found later that the operator, you know, that was, uh, tested positive for drugs.  So, uh --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you know, so I strongly feel that they -- there should be random testing
R:  Yeah.  There's, I mean, th- the lifestyle demands so much really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and I think truck drivers are in the same position that the -- the -- [MN] the job usually requires more than is humanly possible, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  It -- right.  Exactly.  You bet.
R:  So, I can understand [MN] how they would need help to stay up in order to keep up with the de- -- the demands of the job.  But I really [MN] you know --
L:  Well, even -- even with that you've still -- you're putting yourself at risk if that's the reason why you're taking, you know, stimulants to stay awake [NOISE] uh, you know, you -- you begin to put yourself at risk. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, you know, [several inaudible words] many of [NOISE] these people who have may not have a job where there are safety issues, but if you're getting in a car driving someplace, then -- then you're  -- you're a threat to everybody else on the road.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So, uh, but, uh, you know, I've -- I've, uh, you know, worked for employers who have done it.  [NOISE] I've worked for employers who were opposed to it.  You know I personally don't -- don't have a problem now.  I'm not someone who's ever, um, drugs or even on -- on -- I'm not a drinker either.  So, perhaps, you know, there are those who, you know, are casual [NOISE] drinkers, um, [NOISE] you know, who have said, "Well what if, you know, you're randomly tested [NOISE] and you've just had a couple of drinks just socially and you -- you know, you test positive for something; is that going to be a problem?"  But I don't know what kind of [NOISE] controls they put on things like that.  You know, if there are -- there are any levels that are acceptable or levels that are not acceptable, um, you know, I've seen situations where, [NOISE] like, for instance, I do take allergy medicine so, but I would think if they're testing for substances, [NOISE] they would be able to pick up what kind of substances [NOISE] is coming up in your system.  [NOISE] You know, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if that's a problem.
R:  Yeah.  I gu- -- uh, you know, I -- I'm a recovering drug addict so I guess --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I can see from both sides of the fence that, you know, even -- even when I was using drugs I would -- I would have to say that I would be opposed [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to someone who is under the influence.  But I can also see the point of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, what I do on my own time, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is -- is my business.  I guess --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- I can -- I can see if from somebody that really wants to defend their right to smoke pot but in my opinion that's illegal so [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I don't really know if you can defend that too hard.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, you know, and I guess if you do that on your own time, that's in your system for thirty days they can pick that up on a drug test.  And -- and I guess that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I -- I can kind of see their point.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, if I want do that after work then why should that interfere with my having a job.  But ...
L:  Right.  I -- and I don't [several inaudible words] how long certain substances take days in the system and then, I mean, who's to say that if it -- if they're able to pick it up after thirty days in your system, [NOISE] [PAUSE] um --
R:  When do the effects stop?
L:  Yeah.  Like, when did the effects stop?  [several inaudible words] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  How did they know when you're done being stoned? 
L:  Well -- 
R:  Well, that -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] what they're smoking.  [NOISE] Okay.  Um, so perhaps, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, that they're, uh, [NOISE] I guess that too [inaudible] I'm sorry someone else is talking to me -- I'm [NOISE] um, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I guess it would imagine what you're using, um, on what the residual effects are, you know, after you've used it.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I d- -- there's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] so many different drugs, and there's so many different ways around it -- 
L:  Right.
R: -- and I --  
L:  And then too, there's the whole issue of, you know, they're mixing substances.  Um, you know, if the, uh, it's also a problem [NOISE] but, um, but, you know, I still go back to the fact that it's -- if you're using it, you are creating a problem for yourself if for nobody else in -- and perhaps I would feel stronger about it because I had a father who was an alcoholic and a substance abuser so, you know, I -- I'm looking at it from that side.  And, you know, I saw how it destroyed him and how, you know, that adversely affected everybody else in the household.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, you know, maybe I might be a little harsh in my thinking as a result of that [inaudible] 
R:  Oh, I -- I just don't think that you're alone though.  I think that with alcohol being the -- the number one leading drug that's legal, I think that's -- there's -- it's affected everybody in America in a bad way.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just -- I don't think there is anybody out there that hasn't, um, been the victim of somebody's abuse.
L:  Right.  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  It's -- it's everywhere.
L:  So, and then, you know, there are those people who are functional alcoholics or functional cocaine users who go to work and you would never notice.  The only way you would notice there's a problem is if they haven't used, or haven't had anything to drink.  Then their behavior is different.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's crazy.
L:  But it, uh, you know, I -- I don't know, but still, you know, eventually it -- it's going to come back to bite you and, you know, who's to say that you're not going to be harmful to somebody else in -- in some other shape or fashion.  [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.  So, how did you find out about the surveys?
L:  Um, actually I have a friend that works for the university who mentioned it to me.  So, that's how I knew about the survey.
R:  Oh.  Oh, well they're kinda -- I -- I don't know, but I think they're very fun.  This is my --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- third one now.
L:  Di- -- well actually this is my third.  I think it's my third call also.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, at this point so I know, uh, I believe there i- -- that was the limit but if you wanted to sign up for more calls then they were allowing you to do that.  But I understand that, uh, they need over thirty thousand of these conversations to be had.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  I guess it's -- depend on how many people are participating.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Oh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah.  Yeah, I don't --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- know.  I think it's pretty widespread.  I'm -- I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what state are you in?
L:  I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  Pennsylvania?  Okay.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I've -- everybody I've talked to now has been in, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Texas, Pennsylvania and where's the other one?  I forgot where the other gal was from, but ...
L:  [NOISE] Um, 'cuse me, do you have [several inaudible words] [NOISE] Could I have a [several inaudible words] so you -- you -- [NOISE] you talked to someone else in Pennsylvania you said?
R:  No.  No --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I -- I think it was Maryland to tell --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you the truth.  No.
L:  Okay.
R:  Maryland, Pennsylvania.  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  Mm, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.  And I am in Wyoming so --
L:  Oh, wow!  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.   [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, wow.
R:  Quite the difference.  So, you must be at supper, right?  You're two hours later so you must be about six thirty?
L:  I'm -- I'm sorry, I'm in a restaurant and other people are talking to me.  I didn't hear what you just said.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Oh, that's what I asked.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I asked if you were at supper 'cause it must be about six thirty there?
L:  Oh, yes.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So, uh, and all of a sudden they got just very crowded where we are.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, if everybody else has the same idea at the same time to come out and get something [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, uh, well now where you're working, do they have, like, do they do random drug testing there?  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, I'm self employed.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, no I'm -- I'm good.  But my husband; they do random drug tests there all the time.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  For -- 
L:  And -- and how does he feel about it?
R:  Um, uh, well, I'm sure he feels a lot differently now, you know.   Now that we don't do anything any more.  We quit --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- drinking, we quit smoking and -- and so, yeah, now I think he's much more pro. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So when we --
L:  Okay.  
R:  -- did drink he had a, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a pretty offensive little sticker on his lunch pail something about the only -- the only drug test he was taking was the oil exam or something, you know, [inaudible] --
L:  Okay.  What -- 
R:  -- 'cause it's absolutely zero tolerance.  You can end up --
