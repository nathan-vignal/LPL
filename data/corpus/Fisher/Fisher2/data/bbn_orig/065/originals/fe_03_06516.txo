R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Joe.
L:  Hi, Joe.  I'm Lesley.
R:  Hi, Lesley.
L:  Hi.
R:  So uh, ever watched any trials on television, Lesley?
L:  Uh, well, di- a very little bit of, uh, OJs.
R:  Yeah.  You're not a big -- they don't attract you?
L:  No.  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you -- do you have uh --
L:  Not too much.
R:  Do you have cable?
L:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  You -- you had to -- it -- so you get like the whole fan of then, of the -- of the coverage, right, of the -- the -- court TV and the CSPAN and --
L:  Right.  
R:  So you get all the -- all the options to watch them?  You're just uh -- you don't, huh?
L:  No, I don't.  I -- I --
R:  Now --
L:  I do off and on, but not much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But aren't we supposed to talk about drug testing?
R:  Mine -- mine said, uh, court trials.  Yours said drug testing?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  It was yet -- yesterday was court trials.
R:  Oh. Well, mine -- mine when I just called in said, uh, court trials.  Well, let's talk about --
L:  Oh, how weird?
R:  -- both.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  What about drug testing?
L:  [LAUGH].  It said the question is, how do -- how do each of you feel about the practise of companies testing employees for drugs?
R:  Hm.
L:  And do you feel unannounced spot checking drugs to be an invasion of a person's privacy?
R:  Mm.  Ah well, I do.  I -- I think that, uh -- well, I guess it would depend on the type of company, I should say.
L:  Uh-huh?
R:  But uh --
L:  You think the spot checking is an invasion of privacy?
R:  Uh, I would think the spot checking would be an invasion of privacy, yeah.  How about you?
L:  Well, you know, I -- I guess my whole feeling about the -- about the drug issue is in, you know, this society where morals have radically altered --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- it comes with the territory.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, there's -- you know, I worked in a -- in a business for many years that --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- you would never have dreamed the people that used drugs.
R:  Mhm?
L:  And they were critical situations where um -- you know, I would have liked to have known if these people were doing drugs.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Sure.
L:  So I -- I just think when the -- when society moves the direction we've moved, then it's part of the territory.
R:  Mm.
L:  It -- it's an accountability that needs to be there.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  For -- for most -- or for at least for a lot of businesses.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.  No, I agree that there are, like uh certain industries or businesses where ah you know, there are safety concerns and uh reaction time issues and things of this nature.  Right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, and I think it also depends on, like, the uh -- what exactly you're testing for.  
L:  Mhm.  That's true.
R:  To some extent, you know?  Uh, and you know, some -- but some drugs also, like, stay in the system for -- for many, many uh you know, months, if not uh years in some cases. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so the question then also is, you know, is uh -- are you testing for, like, a certain level or frequency --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.
R:  -- or something, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, you know, how -- what -- what -- what kind of a test, you know?  If -- if you just say, like, blanket testing, then --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- I have to say, no, but you know, if you can begin to refine the argument in terms of uh different commun- I mean, different uh like some businesses or industries, you know, different types of what are you actually testing for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  Uh, because to sum it up, I think, you know, oh -- I mean, it depends then for -- you know, like alcohol.  Do you test for alcohol?  Is that considered a drug?  What's considered, you know, a drug at some point?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, nicotine.  I mean, uh, I don't know where you live, but I live here in uh in New York and they've just passed this, like uh smoking legislation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That people in bars now have to go outside.  You know, nicotine is an addiction just like everything else, right?
L:  True.
R:  And, you know, it's caused um problems.  I mean, somebody was actually like stabbed and killed because, you know, some bouncer said, "You can't smoke in here", right?  And so they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like kinda went crazy on a nicotine fit, you know?  It's like, you know, "I'm gonna smoke in here" um, so I guess, you know, like it depends on the type of drug you uh -- the -- the type of business, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Also I think too are some -- well, nicotine --
R:  And the whole spot checking --
L:  -- I think is --
R:  -- thing, too.  You know, I mean, that -- that's kind of interesting.  You know?  I mean, if you go into it willingly, knowingly, okay, if I apply for this job or I were to get this job, uh, they would test me.
L:  That's what I was gonna say.
R:  There's that the one thing.
L:  If you go in knowing --
R:  But then you know, if somebody just comes up to you one day and says, you know, "You have to now -- we have to draw blood or you have to, uh, you know, pee into this cup or we have to take a -- a saliva swab" or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and you just had no clue or indication of this, I think that's another kind of uh side of it, too.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I -- yeah, that wouldn't be right, but if it -- but if you got a job where they test you going in --
R:  Yeah, if you knew.  If you -- yeah.
L:  -- and you're aware --
R:  You're aware.  This is -- yeah.
L:  And also, I would want --
R:  This is part of the package.  If you want to do this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.  
L:  Also I think if um -- you know, I would want to make sure that that's all they're testing for.
R:  Mm.  
L:  Because I know a lot of times --
R:  Like what -- like what, then?  Like what else?  What else could you --
L:  Well, you -- I don't know.  You done blood and you find out -- in fact, I just doned blood and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- found out that by -- I ran into someone I knew uh know that works --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- at a -- at a donor place which I didn't realize --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we were talking about it and she said they test your blood for about ten different things.
R:  Mm.
L:  I'm going, "Really?"  
R:  Mm.
L:  You know?  I didn't know that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  So, you know --
R:  Yeah, when you donate blood, I know that they, like, test for uh hepatitis and HIV and uh I think they're e- they're even trying to like develop something for mad cow.  I don't think they, like, have that test at this point -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but yeah, they're testing for uh all sorts of things. 
L:  Well, I can see -- I knew, you know, the HIV and that sort of thing, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but --
R:  And then I don't know if it's, like, they're responsible.  I don't think it's then their responsibility to tell you if they find anything.  
L:  Well, I -- yeah.  I hope they just don't report it.  I mean, I -- to report --
R:  Well --
L:  -- it beyond, you know, without you knowing, that sort of thing.
R:  I think some places they are required to, like you know -- well, I don't know.  Then, like, register it with the uh the state.  There's some --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  Mm.
L:  I suppose anything communicable.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But um -- but tobacco, you know, tobacco, even though it's addictive --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and a drug --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it doesn't impair judgement.  
R:  Mm.  No, it doesn't seem to.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that -- I mean, I was a heavy smoker for years.
R:  Mm.  Mm.
L:  I'm not now, and have not been for as many years --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- but um, that doesn't impair your judgement.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like other drugs.
R:  But caffeine does, doesn't it?
L:  No, not your judgement.
R:  Mm.  
L:  Uh-huh.  It might if you didn't have any.  [LAUGH].  No, just kidding.
R:  [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH].  It would distract you if you didn't --
R:  Right.  
L:  'Cause I was a -- very distracted if I didn't [COUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but not -- certainly not smoking, didn't impair my judgement.
R:  Right.  How about, like, all these pilots are now like flying planes, uh, you know, tanked up drunk.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I mean, you know?  Shouldn't they kind of be, uh -- I mean, that would be a situation I think most people would agree that, you know, those people should be tested.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We should know that they're flying sober, right?
L:  Right.  They should also test physicians.  [MN].
R:  Mm.  
L:  And anybody in -- in positions that are -- that are um -- you know, have somebody else's life in their hands.
R:  Mm.  
L:  I would -- I would not find that offensive at all, if they did that --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- type of thing. 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But [MN] especially the young guys coming in.
R:  Mm.  
L:  Um, I don't know.  I was -- uh, I'm in California.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah, you guys have --
L:  And --
R:  -- got tough, uh, smoking legislation too.  
L:  Yeah, they do have.  In fact, I'm --
R:  And you've had it for years.  It's brand new here.
L:  -- so glad I'm -- uh-huh, I'm so glad I don't smoke now because I'd have -- be having a fit if I did.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  
L:  'Cause I -- I have a real strong opinion about the tobacco industry.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And the law -- you know, the -- the way they're coming down on people, I think if it's that harmful, they ought to come down on the company and close the company.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, or something, but not --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- the individual that's already hooked.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.  It can take so many different forms, I guess, of prejudice.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you have to wonder, too, with this uh -- with this drug testing thing, you know, do companies then like have to tell you?  I mean, exactly what they found?
L:  Yeah.  I think if -- you know, if your company that requires --
R:  Because haven't there been, like, these --
L:  -- testing --
R:  -- strange tests where, uh, people had like a poppy seed bagel and there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- enough of a trace in a poppy seed bagel to, like you know, throw the test off?
L:  Yes.  In fact, I had a very young friend that that happened to.
R:  Mm.
L:  And uh he had to prove that he had had poppy seeds.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH].  On his -- on his -- you know, one of those fancy [inaudible] seeded things.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Uh, it does affect it.  So you'd have to -- I mean, you know, as with anything else, reason --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- has to do with it, and reason generally goes out the door once people --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- overreact.  
R:  Sure.  Yeah.  
L:  But um [MN], if you can't go on reason, like -- like let's say, truck drivers.
R:  Mm.
L:  They -- they're out on the road.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Right, yeah.
L:  My brother, my younger brother, is a driver --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in Oregon --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a local --
R:  Mhm.
L:  He drives locally, doesn't make long trips, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think they do drug testing.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, one would hope.
L:  Uh, because he's on the road all the time.
R:  Yeah.  And with this huge piece of machinery, right?  This enormous uh thing.
L:  [MN].  Right.
R:  It's not just a little car, it's thousands and thousands of pounds of stuff, yeah.
L:  Pounds, mhm.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And with, um, uh, road rage being an issue --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, any of those kind of jobs, I just don't have a problem with it.  I just think --
R:  Yeah, so then they like -- do they like test for uh -- because road rage comes about at least in part sometimes because of our hormones, you know, like from body builders like, uh, doing hormones and stuff, right?  
L:  Oh, yeah.  Huh.
R:  So is that, like -- you know, is that a consideration?  I mean, you know?  
L:  Well, I think any drug that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- if you're a driver, if you're a specific driver, like, that's your --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- occupation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so you are on the road, uh, considerably more than the average driver.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Right.
L:  Then you should fall under some kind of guideline of testing.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I just think society has gone so -- it's the double edged sword, you know?  They want to do it -- we want to do what we want to do, but we don't want to be accountable.
R:  Right.  
L:  And uh it just can't be that way.  It's too --
R:  So --
L:  It's too risky.
R:  So are truck drivers, uh, in that industry, is it -- is it standard for them to be tested or does it vary from company to company, though?
L:  I don't really know.  I just know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that his company has it.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  
L:  And um --
R:  I would bet it's --
L:  -- if the --
R:  Unless it's probably like -- unless it's, like, state or county regulated though, I bet it's like, you know, pretty mu- it would still be company to company.
L:  Probably.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And I don't know that Oregon law is --
R:  And I'm sure it -- yeah.  I'm sure it, like, varies from state to state and county to county, all sorts of little --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, strange things vary completely, you know, just in that way.  
L:  Mhm.  I'm wondering if they'll ever come to the -- to the point where the --
