L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they just want --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unique, individually.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But back in my country we -- we take the family as one unit, [NOISE] that's the way it is.

L:  [SIGH] I --
R:  -- you find out, even though when you're grown up, [NOISE] you -- you [several inaudible words] don't live each other, or -- say I'm a doctor, my sister's a lawyer; if I need some [NOISE] medical help --
