R:  Charlene.
L:  [NOISE] Beth.
R:  Hm.
L:  Oh, hi.
R:  Oh, hi, uh, [inaudible] so, how are you?
L:  Pretty good.  
R:  Good.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Good, thank you.  So, uh, the topic of the day it's -- a- ah, how do we feel about companies having drug tests? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, jeeze.  Is it your first time doing this?
L:  No, I did it, um, the other day.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Um, well, what do you feel about the issue? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I think that it's justified by companies to be able to do that, 'cause I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're giving money in for the people to work and -- [MN] you know.
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree with you.  I think it's, you know -- it's -- anyway, that's the law, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] for some of the drugs that are illegal, so especially if you're gonna work for some place, then I think [MN] -- it's the workers are liable for the, you know, if someone's on drugs, or something happens, or -- and also it's the company that they're gonna come to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just -- I just think, you know, it's a -- it's right that they should have this, and [NOISE] [LAUGH] you know -- 
L:  Yeah, 'cause -- 
R:  -- like the --
L:  -- that's also something that could affect their job performance.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's --
L:  'Cause, you know, if they're on drugs, then who knows what they'll do, you know --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- at work or --
R:  -- [NOISE] especially if you're working, I think, you know, something, you know, that they need to have tests.  Well, if it's -- if you're not gonna be working at -- it's okay and it's up to you, but, you know, I guess it's just like having, you know, um, drinking and driving, where the police have to test the person, see, you know, if they're drunk or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess it -- it goes the same way with working.  In the working environment.  
L:  Yeah, but they should give, like, a little bit of warning.  'Cause I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- part of the question was whether it's unannounced or not.  So --
R:  Oh, unannounced?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That should -- yeah, they should have -- well, yeah, [NOISE] well, I guess the -- it's usually the -- in, um, if you work for, like, the government or, like, in the hospital or something [LIPSMACK], there they do have these kind of testings.  So, they -- obviously the person is aware that they're gonna have these testings.
L:  Doesn't drugs take, like, two days to get out of your system anyways? [MN]
R:  Oh, it does?  Oh, I don't know.
L:  Isn't it about two days I thought?
R:  I -- actually it depends what kinda -- I think it depends what kind of drugs you're talking about.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah [MN].  The -- the ones that are more, like, severe, I think takes a few months, I think with the --
L:  Oh, it takes a few months?
R:  I think so, with some of the drugs, I think.  
L:  That's a long time.
R:  Yeah, it's a long time.
L:  Well, they also have products that you can buy at the store that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- help to --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- don't they?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So [MN] if you need to take a drug test or something --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- you just dr- drink this product and it helps --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I think.
R:  Ah, yo- you ever tried it before?
L:  No.  No, no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just read about it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Yeah, I don't know anything about that. I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Did you ever work anywhere that they actually offer this to you, that had to have this testing?
L:  The drug test?  Yeah.
R:  Oh, you did.  No -- no way that -- 'cause I -- no.  I don't have any of those testings.  I guess it doesn't matter for me, 'cause I just, uh -- I've not ever been involved in the drugs, so it doesn't make a difference whatsoever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think some places should have the -- you know, they should have the testing, whether it's announced or not announced, they should have it.  Well, it doesn't -- you know, the person could [NOISE] either work there if they want, or if they don't want to, they don't have to go work there, so ...
L:  Yeah, [MN] especially right at the beginning when you're first hiring somebody.
R:  Exactly.  So, if you don't feel like it's a good job for you, then, you know, just don't go there [inaudible] bother about asking to have the testing or not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but I just, you know, it's [SIGH] -- it's just -- it's -- to begin with you shouldn't even be taking it, so --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- if it was right, they wouldn't have made it illegal. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah, plu- -- I don't know, I just think the [COUGH] -- I tr- -- I don't know, I -- I -- I just think they should have this [NOISE] kind of test available.  Do you know what kind of, uh, [MN] area- -- what jobs offer this kind of testing?  Have you ever ...?
L:  Well, the one -- the job that, um --
R:  [NOISE] I think it's --
L:  -- had me do one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- was just -- it was at the grocery store, but it was a union store --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, oh.
L:  -- so I think that they're more --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm [LIPSMACK].
L:  -- you know, into that sort of thing.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  I -- I think that it kind of, you know, it's gonna affect the way you, um, just work and, you know, treat others --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you're on the drugs or not. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Probably, especially in places where you're dealing with food or customers a lot.
R:  Right, wh- where it's more dangerous or, you know, there's a lot of people there, and -- you know, yeah, you're right, I guess in markets too.  That's true.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought it was like with the governments and stuff.  
L:  Yeah, I think they do it a lot too, but --
R:  Mhm [LIPSMACK], yeah.
L:  -- that's probably just 'cause it's the government, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly [LAUGH] -- couldn't get with -- you know, top government data[?], yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but -- yeah, I guess they should have it.  And it's really serious, this issue.  Like, if anything does happen, you know, the person that's -- you know, everyone's gonna be looking to sue anyhow, so it's a good excuse --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to say that, you know, they weren't tested or, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they could come up -- they could sue and get money from the workers as well as going to the companies.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I guess that's why it's the companies' responsibility to have these tests available.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it's not even that difficult to take a drug test anyways.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  So, I mean -- 
R:  Well -- yeah, yeah, it's not --
L:  -- if you are going to have a problem with it, then it's probably 'cause you are taking drugs --
R:  Exac- --
L:  -- and not because it's out of your way or anything.  
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess it's just -- I guess it affects those people that are actually on it, that, you know, kinda --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- worried about it.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But -- but both ways [NOISE] I think it's -- I don't think it's right to be taking those drugs to begin with.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Definitely not.
R:  Yeah, you -- do -- do you think so too? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I never took drugs, so I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know why people even do it, but ...
R:  Yeah, me too, I don't know.  Yeah, I guess it does affect the way you -- you know, of work and all that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] The ten minutes is not over?
L:  No, I don't think so.  I think it'll -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is this your first time doing this?
R:  [NOISE] No, I've done it before --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- uh, just the once. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, me too, just the once.
R:  Yeah.  But, I don't know, this is a pretty tough subject [MN].  I don't know -- I don't know what to really say about this [LAUGH].  Anything else.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I don't really know much about it. 
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I try to think of what to say, but it's -- it's a tough issue, I don't know.  I guess, just, shouldn't bother messing around with it to begin with, and, I tell you, that's it.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] I don't know.  I don't know.  Do you have anything else to say about this issue?
L:  Um ...
R:  [MN]
L:  Not really.  I mean ...
R:  Well, what -- the -- yeah, the question was if, yeah, uh, what do you think about companies, um, that offer this kind of testing?
L:  Oh, was that part of the question?
R:  Yeah, th- -- was it?
L:  Oh, I don't know.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, the companies, I mean, I think they're justified, so ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think they're justified too.  It's good we both have the same point of view.  I guess that everybody would, like, be like this.
L:  Yeah, probably. 
R:  Unless if you were on the drugs, then you might have a different, um, point of view.
L:  Yeah.  I know, like, some places, though, don't, you know, require drug tests and they probably should. 
R:  Right.  Where -- like, what places do you think?
L:  Well, like, just the same sort of places like --
R:  Oh, really?  You mean in, like --
L:  Well, [MN] 'cause the first -- I worked at grocery stores twice, and the first one didn't require that, but the second one did.
R:  Were there -- were there difference in the people there?
L:  What?
R:  What -- was there difference in the people there?  Like --
L:  Um, well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the one that did require --
R:  Was it a drug free environment or ...?
L:  -- well, I mean, they both wanted to be drug free environments.  And I think they probably pretty much --
R:  Much were.  Oh.
L:  -- were, but the second one was a union and it -- it was a big chain of -- of grocery stores --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and the first one that didn't require it wasn't union, and they were really, really small.
R:  Oh, oh, that's why maybe.
L:  [MN]
R:  So they didn't really make a -- right.
L:  So, yeah, maybe that's probably why [SIGH].
R:  Right, right.  But it -- I think it's good to have it, even for the customers that come there, you know, they feel kind of safer.  I mean, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, probably the customers don't even think about it, [LAUGH] so --
R:  No, they -- yeah, yeah, that's true.  I don't know if -- uh, that's right, I don't really know if -- you can kind of see in their eyes are like, you know, the way they act, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if a person's coming there to look for trouble, then it's a good excuse.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But I don't think really -- [inaudible] I don't think anybody [LAUGH] really goes and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- looks for that kind of thing [LAUGH].
L:  Maybe -- some people might.  You never know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Some people do, that's true [SIGH].  But anyways, I think they should have the test, and it's -- yeah, you're right, it's justified.  [LIPSMACK] Yes, um, anything else you feel about the subject?
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Boy, this is a long ten minutes [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, the first topic was a lot easier.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah?
L:  Uh, we had your hobbies.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  But, uh, so that one was kinda really easy to talk about. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  This one's kinda tough, this issue.  I mean, I don't know what else to say. [NOISE] Uh, jeeze -- [NOISE] yeah, I don't know.  Tough issue.
L:  Mm.
R:  Mm. 
L:  [inaudible].
R:  But, I -- yeah, that's all I have to say about it.  I mean, just [MN], I guess -- I guess since we're not really using drugs or anything, it doesn't make a difference for us to -- just to have it or, I mean, you know ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] So, like I say, it's not really invading their privacy, I mean, it's [SIGH] something that needs to be done and needs -- you know, they have to make sure it's a safe environment, [NOISE] clean and healthy.
L:  Yeah.  I mean they're --
R:  That's the way they -- huh?
L:  -- they're paying your wages, so --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean --
L:  -- they have the right to, you know, hire whoever they want, based on --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- whatever they want, so ...
R:  And I guess before they warn them that they're gonna be having the drug test, so if you want it you can [NOISE] work there, and if you don't [SIGH] like that, then tough luck.  Just don't work there, go find another place where they don't [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- offer it.  Right?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, right, that's true [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
