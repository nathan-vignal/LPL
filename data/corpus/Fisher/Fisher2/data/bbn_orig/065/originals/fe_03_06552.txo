R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Yeah, my name is Bill, I'm in Wisconsin.
L:  Hi.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I guess the topic is about, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how you feel about drug testing in [MN] -- random drug testing people at wh- -- at your -- workplace.
L:  Just random, or [NOISE] is that -- is that what they said, 'cause I missed part of it?
R:  I think they said it was random.
L:  Random?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- how do you feel about it? [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I don't -- I -- I've never even thought about it but I -- but [SIGH] to a degree, I -- I understand why, but to a degree I think it's wrong.  I'm kinda between.
L:  [LAUGH] Me too, I think so, um, I guess it depends what field, also --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what kind of -- I mean, like you wouldn't [MN] want your doctor or somebody, um, maybe on ah, some kind of drug they shouldn't be taking, you know, anything that's going to obscure their thinking --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but um, I don't know, I don't think random's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- good.  I think -- I mean if you let --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody know, and um, you know, if there's a problem with them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have a choice to make. 
R:  Okay.
L:  And then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it- it's either a choice -- if they're doing something illegal to either stop or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, to find work elsewhere probably.
R:  Yeah.  Well, ye- yeah -- yeah, it does depend a bit, I was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thinking about airpl- airplane pilots, they'd be kind of -- you know, they should have random tests --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for those people -- those -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --those -- any- anybody who's got other people's lives in jeopardy should have those kind --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of tests on, um, on a regular basis --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, um just a regular office worker?  Um, I -- I -- I understand why, because --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know, I myself would not want to work with somebody who's -- who basically is going to come into work high as a kite --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, who you can't depend on -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in an office environment, but on the -- but on the other hand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I also look it at as in invasion of privacy too --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- um, I think it is.  There's too much invasion of privacy going on -- going on in our lives, um --
L:  I think if there's cause.
R:  Yeah, if there's cause, that's fine.
L:  If there's -- if there's like a problem and there's a -- a suspected problem or somebody is really not doing their job, I mean, maybe a -- a you know, a mention it and then -- and then if there's a real reason, but, I mean, I think what people do in their own time is a personal thing. 
R:  I -- I agree with that a hundred percent, I -- I -- I --
L:  And if --
R:  -- don't think anybody in the company should -- should care what you do in your own time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- unle- unle- unless you bring it to the work force.
L:  Right, I mean if there's some- [NOISE] something really wrong --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then -- then there might be cause to; if there's, you know --
R:  Yeah, I used to work --
L:  -- inefficiency or you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- danger, or something.
R:  Right.  I used to work, um, wi- -- in -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at GM in Michigan when we were there, and I worked in a -- I worked in a -- in a pl- -- in a plant where it was -- where of course --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was unionized and I'd see people coming in all the time drunk --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- building cars.  They'd send --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- them home and they'd come back the next day because the union mu- -- the union was protecting their jobs. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They couldn't fire these people --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- because they were -- because -- because they were -- they'd been on the job for so long, "You -- you can't fire these people 'cause they're union".
L:  That's --
R:  Think that's not on --
L:  Odd.
R:  -- I think that's going to far [MN] with it.  I dunno, if they -- if they're gonna come to work drunk, and cause other [inaudible] -- cause people harm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they shouldn't be working in a place like that.
L:  Well and theirselves.  I mean if they're putting things together or whatever, you -- you got to -- you know, be careful. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Especially with all the chemicals and all the -- and all the -- and all the stuff that they had in this plant, they could -- they could cause somebody some seriously -- serious harm if they don't do it just right.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, [MN] yeah I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I kinda -- I'm kinda mixed between -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how I really feel about that, I, um  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean -- but, like you said, if there's a problem, if some of the coworkers complain, yeah, let them go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, to their boss and say, "Okay, we think this guy --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- could be harming us, or harming our work environment --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- maybe he should be tested".
L:  Mhm.  Or at least talked to, and then -- and then --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, tested or something --
R:  [NOISE] But to randomly pick somebody for testing, I mean with the job I have now, they -- I h- -- I had to go to drug testing before I could -- before I could go to work there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I think that's okay. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But to pick just somebody -- just pick randomly out, to do ah -- to do that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after they've been there for a long time, I think -- I don't know if that's really --
L:  No, I don't agree with that.  I mean I think -- I mean I -- I -- is it -- I just think if there's a real problem --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because what's the point anyway then?  
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Just to fire an employee that is -- that is doing their job?
R:  Right.
L:  What would be the point, you know?
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  To lose maybe a good worker, you know?
R:  Well, I agree a hundred per cent.  I [SIGH] -- you know 'cause sometimes, you know, some people are -- in my job there are good workers and there are lousy workers and it's like, they -- what do you do? [SIGH] [LAUGH] I'm sure that's in every job --
L:  [COUGH] Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- that kids are -- there's people that are both good and bad.
L:  That- that's true.  And it doesn't matter how good they are or how bad they are, they can keep their jobs sometimes, it's all different.
R:  Exactly. [PAUSE] So [SIGH] -- I was going to say something --
L:  So, I think we are agreeing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think so too.
L:  If there's cause or whatever, but randomly no, I don't think so.  If the whole intent is to just, you know, terminate someone or something. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Just like I don't think it's right that they -- they can pull your um -- pull your credit history to determine whether you get hired or not too, or keep a job. 
L:  [MN]
R:  And also people that -- that um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that I work at -- they didn't get the job there because they pulled their credit history; their credit history was not up to par.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  That's --
R:  And I think that goes along the same way as this random drug testing, they don't have [NOISE] -- they don't have the right to pull your credit report to determine that you keep a job or not, because who cares if you're off the job, how you really -- how you really spend your money.
L:  Right.  That doesn't really seem right.
R:  No, it doesn't.  And I uh [MN] in certain jobs I under- -- I can understand that it's best if you have -- if you're like -- if you're in charge of a company's money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] I can -- I can -- I can understand them looking at that, to -- to judge whether or not you can handle large sums of money -- how much you -- how much -- how could you handle money at your home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That I understand, but just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- randomly to -- to do that kind of testing.
L:  Right, it doesn't seem like it has anything to do with the work, unless it, you know, unless it specifically does --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause I mean you could have a second job, you could have w- whatever, or maybe, you know -- maybe you just have a lot of bills or things you need to pay, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- hospitalization [NOISE] problems or something, it all depends --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- you know, people get- -- go into debt very easily.
R:  Oh yes, it's very easy to go into debt.
L:  You know 
R:  Yeah, so I [COUGH] -- I think that's wrong too, so I -- I -- I do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I know there -- you know there's -- there's -- there's -- there is too much of an invasion of privacy going on in our -- our lives now with --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- y- y- you know, it is like, some of the stuff they don't really need to know.
L:  Of course not. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, what you do in private is private.  Mm.
L:  Right, as long as it's not really, really horrible. [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Well, you know what I mean. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  You're not allowed to be beating people in your family, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Right [LAUGH] I agree.
L:  But, um, really, really.
R:  You know, I hope most people are -- are sane enough to -- to realize that too.
L:  Right, well you know though, real life is pretty rough. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I work in the -- I work in a ministry --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where I talk to people all day long, the public at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- random. [SIGH] And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I had a pretty good feel of -- for people in the public but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there were some pretty strange ones out there I've come across.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And [SIGH] I kinda wonder about them.  Especially when you hear things in the background that you normally w- won't hear any place else. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Well, there's a lot of odd, really scary [LAUGH] people, you gotta be really careful. 'Cause
R:  Yeah, you -- you -- you have to be really careful, and I don't think [SIGH] yeah, the drug test is one way to do it, but I -- you know it's like [SIGH] -- but another way I can understand why a company would want to drug test, because if you're doing drugs and you -- and they're paying for your medical insurance, you know that -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- how much is that -- how much is that employee gonna use up of their medical insurance -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if -- if they're taking drugs and doing drugs?
L:  I dunno, I guess -- I mean, it depends if -- if you were to have an accident or something, but -- [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, if -- if you, on your off hours, like a lot of people drink, and I mean, it's legal --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, people are, you know, given alcohol in places and then they drive home --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- so I mean right [NOISE] there is a liability --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yo- you know. [NOISE] And that's -- and that's a legal thing, [NOISE] but if people are like off the job, [NOISE] I mean if you're having a problem in your job, you know what I mean [NOISE] --
R: Mm.
L:  -- and you're taking time off -- there's cake in the oven honey -- you're, you know, you're -- you're not -- you're not functioning, [LIPSMACK] you know, but if you're at home [NOISE] and you're relaxing or doing whatever you wanna do and you -- and nothing's really wrong --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  -- I -- I -- I just -- I dunno, I don't see [NOISE] -- it -- it all depends, you know?  I think that each case should be evaluated.  I'm not happy for -- I mean random, and I -- but I do think it's fine if it's [NOISE] posted before you, um, apply for work, because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're making a choice right there, you know [NOISE] knowing, you know, that there are consequences against, you know, drug use. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  So.
R:  Yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- but, that should be part of the -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the package you get when you go -- when you go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hire for somebody.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Well, it's --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- usually posted in some places [NOISE] you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, I'm su- -- I'm not sure if they have to tell you about it, I don't know. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah a- a- and most companies --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they won't tell you ahead of time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that we do random drug testing, I mean they should [inaudible] -- they at least should let you know they're gonna be te- -- possibly testing you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When you get hired --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but -- but -- [MN] -- not to tell anybody and just say, "Okay, you have to ahead and do that --"
