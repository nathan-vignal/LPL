L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello [LAUGH].
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm El- -- I'm Elaine, who are you?
L:  Dorothy.
R:  Who?
L:  Dorothy.
R:  Dorothy?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi, Dorothy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you -- where do you live?
L:  Texas.
R:  Okay, I'm in Connecticut.
L:  Oh, we're gonna be there soon.
R:  Yo- -- are you?
L:  Yeah, I'm coming in June -- but we're supposed to talk about drug abuse [LAUGH].
R:  Where are you going in June?
L:  Uh, uh, Toronto, Canada [MN].  
R:  To where?
L:  Toronto --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, you --
L:  -- and then -- then we're coming down --
R:  To Connecticut?
L:  -- to New Jersey.  Well --
R:  And where are you going in Connecticut?
L:  Well, we're going to New Jersey, so I'm not sure if I'll get Connecticut or not in that trip.  
R:  Oh, I don't know, I can- -- I'm not really sure.  I just came back from New Jersey. [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Drug abuse in the -- in the company workplace, huh --
R:  In the workplace.
L:  -- being tested.
R:  Are you working?
L:  I worked up until a year ago.
R:  Okay.  [MN] And --
L:  And we did not do drug testing at -- when I was hired we did not, and I don't remember ever being -- doing drug testing.
R:  Did you work for a large company?
L:  I worked for a private company that was housed on the, uh, Texas A and M campus.
R:  Okay.  
L:  But it was a private company.  'Bout a hundred and fifty of us [SIGH].
R:  All right.  And they didn't do -- I worked for a -- a larger company.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield at Connecticut --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, uh, there were [MN] -- oh, close to two thousand employees --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they did not do drug testing.
L:  They did not do drug testing?  
R:  They did not do drug testing.
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  So, I -- what I have noticed, and you probably have too, is going into, [SIGH] um, the larger, um, stores such as Home Depot.  Right on the door, it said, uh, you know, "We do drug testing", so -- so much in -- in essence, if you're [SIGH] -- if you're doing drugs, don't even bother applying, because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're not gonna pass.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  And also, you see it in the paper, random drug testing done when, you know --
R:  Right, and when they -- when you see ads in the classified ad --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- for, uh, for folks that are -- are taking driving jobs or --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- specifically, they said they do drug testing.  But it was interesting, today I -- I just read in the paper -- it was one of the, uh, uh, advice columns.  This girl was sharing an apartment with, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, uh, a friend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, the friend, she -- not she, but the friend and the friend's boyfriend were doing pot.  And she said that her company [MN] recently inisia- -- initiated drug testing.  And she was concerned that it was such a -- you know, a heavy atmosphere of drugs that it was going to affect her and skew --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they did randomly test her.      
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, the advice from the columnist was -- was to get out of there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- n- not simply because of -- of the consequences, but just it was a very bad environment for her to even be living in.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah [SIGH].
R:  But, you know, I can see where [MN], you know, people being employed in a -- in a sensitive area, uh, their employer would want to make sure that they're, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they're clean, because otherwise they're subject to lawsuits.
L:  Well, also, 'cause, like, my husband's, uh, field, he's a -- a deputy sheriff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so he -- uh, don't know that he's ever been drug tested, but I'm sure they do it in the -- in the -- in the -- I know they do it in the jail, and then I'm sure they do it in the -- in the police department itself.
R:  What do you mean, in the jail?  You mean by the, uh ...?
L:  I think the jail, uh -- the prisoners --
R:  Uh, for the prisoners or for the --
L:  Drug tested?
R:  -- or for the, uh ...?
L:  They can be.  He -- he said that prisoners as well as the jailers, but the prisoners can be drug tested too.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And they do it randomly?
L:  Oh, I'm sure they do it randomly.  That's the only way. [MN] You can't [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I g- -- I know.
L:  -- that's like saying --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Well, we're gonna have a test on ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Yes [inaudible].
L:  That's not gonna work --
R:  You wanna --
L:  -- 'cause they're gonna not do anything for twenty four hours and then they're, you know, [SIGH] um --
R:  I think it takes longer than that.
L:  Yeah. [inaudible]
R:  [MN] I don't know how you feel about drug testing, uh --
L:  I, uh, like I say, I've never had it done, but because I don't do drugs, it wouldn't bother me if they did it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  Uh, I think it's -- [MN] like you said, in -- in places it -- it -- I think -- well, actually, in any work field it should -- you should have drug testing.  
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I -- I -- you know, and again, uh, we probably don't see a problem with it --
L:  No. [NOISE]
R:  -- because, you know, we're not doing drugs.  I think if -- if you were doing drugs, then you would become more sensitive to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  One of the things, and I don't know whether you've ever heard about this, but I think it's poppy seeds, that if you have anything with poppy seeds and you're randomly selected to do drug testing, uh, it -- you can show up positive --
L:  Yes, I've heard that.  Um, there's something in the poppy seed, like po- p- poppy seed cake or something, I have heard that --
R:  So what -- so what the heck do you do if your company --
L:  -- uh, it's opium [inaudible].
R:  -- what if your -- your -- your co- -- your company's doing drug testing and you -- you inadvertently, or because you just happen to like 'em --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ate poppy seeds the day before.
L:  Yeah, like our office used to have cakes and stuff in their office, right.  So you had a piece of poppy seed cake and that afternoon you get tested, well --
R:  Yeah, what do you do then?
L:  Ah, you -- I would say you admit that, you know, "I had poppy seed that ...", you know, there's got to be a way that they can tell the difference between a regular [MN] opium, uh, test and a -- that it was poppy seed induced test.
R:  [MN]
L:  There's gotta be a way to tell that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I was driving home, uh, today, and I had one of the talk stations on.  Uh, your husband will probably find this interesting as a deputy sherf- sheriff.  Uh, you know, it's not drugs, but it's in the -- you know, in the general field.  This guy called up and he was complaining [SIGH] that he, um ... and he was really very articulate and spoke very well, and he said he was out to a party and at the party he had, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a couple of beers, and on the way home he was stopped by the police --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they asked him, you know, if he had been drinking.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And he said, "I had, you know, a couple of beers".
L:  Right.
R:  And they had him do the, uh, um, the physical test and then the breathalyzer --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- and I think it said he came up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- zero point six --
L:  Zero point six, that's -- yeah.
R:  -- and -- and what they did was they arrested him.  And that [MN] even this -- this was below --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the normal range of being intoxicated --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a zero point six.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, he was talking to the talk show host, and said that, uh, "You know, how could they do this?"  First of all, you know, to stop you indiscriminately on the road, um, and then subject you to all of these tests and -- and all of -- you know, he went through the physical test with no problem, and that zero point six was below the, uh, D.W.I. range --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- and he said they still arrested him.  So, what the talk show host said was that -- and check this with your husband -- he said that if anybody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is stopped they -- their usual standard answer is, "Well, how many drinks did you have?" and it's always two.  Either two or a couple.  
L:  [NOISE] Huh.
R:  And he said, "You -- what you did is you fell right into the -- into the trap of the -- of the range that people always give".
L:  But I wonder what pulled him over.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  It -- it didn't go --
L:  I -- uh -- it wouldn't have been the drinking unless he was weaving enough to cause them --
R:  I -- I don- -- I don't know, unless he said they were just, you know, randomly stopping people.
L:  That's tr- true, they do randomly stop for, uh, alcohol testing.
R:  Um, so I don't know, so he said that two or a couple is the standard answer  --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that people give.
L:  "Well, I had five" and then they let you go [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- and I like that you brought up alcohol, because al- alcohol is a drug, as well as these other things that are out there.  It's a drug just the same, I think.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  'Cause you get addicted to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and -- and --
R:  And, uh --
L:  -- n- nicotine -- the cigarettes.  That's a drug --
R:  Well --
L:  -- but it's not -- it does no -- it doesn't affect you like the other stuff.
R:  But I think it's -- it's, you know, again, uh, I did not wanna -- do you smoke?
L:  [NOISE] No, I do not.
R:  Okay.
L:  Never tried it.  My father wanted me to light his cigarettes in his last few days of life and I would not touch them.  I said, "No, I don't want to, I've never had one near my mouth" and then --
R:  Why'd your father want you to have a cigarette?
L:  He wanted me to light his cigarettes --
R:  Oh, light his, okay.
L:  -- and I went, "No". [LAUGH]
R:  I, um, I -- I would not hire somebody that was a smoker.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, when, you know, we interviewed, I -- I -- in a way that, after, you know, it was not allowed in the building, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I -- I would say, "It's -- there's a no smoking policy here --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- um, is that gonna be a problem for you?" and either they would answer, "No" or they would say, "Well, no, 'cause I don't smoke".
L:  Right.
R:  But I have found -- and I've worked with wonderful people, I mean, close friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that had to go out every hour outside --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- for a cig- -- for a cigarette.
L:  And they're out in the cold [LAUGH].
R:  Out in the cold with no coat --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just getting out there, puffing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a cigarette.
L:  And -- and nowadays --
R:  And that really takes a lot of -- I -- I -- I -- again, where the drug testing, where they're trying to prevent accidents, and, you know, just liability issues --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think the -- the cigarettes take a lot of productive work from people's time.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  And then how do you know it's a cigarette and not something else that they've rolled up to make it look like a cigarette?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  And then, you know, they're still not functioning properly.
L:  No.
R:  So, in --
