L:  Hello?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, hello.
L:  Hi.  Hi, this is Sonia.
R:  Hi, my name is Paul.
L:  Hi, Paul.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you doing?
L:  Good, thanks.  Okay, well I have been a teacher and I don't think that censorship is a good idea.  I think that, um, you know, the market place of ideals should -- ideas should not be censored, and I'm a writer as well as a teacher and I really prefer that censorsh- censorship not occur.
R:  Now I tend to agree.  I mean, I think some things though aren't age appropriate but I don't know how you -- you work that in without, you know, it's sort of -- it g- gets on the edge of censorship.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, adult -- I mean, nothing should be censored for adults.
L:  Oh, of course not.
R:  But -- but with kids it's -- yeah, it's hard to say.  I mean, the problem is that the library -- you know, school's have had a history of banning the wrong books it seems.
L:  Right.
R:  And that kind of -- but, you know, stuff with like really graphic violence and that kind of thing, you wouldn't necessarily -- I mean, I could see a library not having those books.
L:  Right.
R:  But, like, if a kid -- but I -- [MN] it's -- I guess the situation, let's say, if a kid is in school and he has a book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In that case should he be punished for that?  Should it be taken away from him?  
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and I would tend to agree that it shouldn't be.  It's -- it's his property.
L:  Exactly.  And [MN] -- and say for the libraries, um, I think that, you know, obviously the librarian should have the expertise to know what is age appropriate, grade level appropriate, but, um, I think there has been too much censorship that's gone on already.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  Have you done one of these calls before?
R:  No.  This is my first one.  
L:  Mine too.
R:  I got -- I signed up for it just before the weekend and then --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- got a call and wasn't -- wasn't there to take it.
L:  Right.
R:  And so I figured I would call in to make sure that [LAUGH] they could reach me because I didn't realise I'd be called during the holiday weekend.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, let's see how -- [MN] ten minutes is long.  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  Oh, I know -- I know that.  Now do you -- are you a participant or you work for Fisher?
L:  I'm a participant.  
R:  Oh, okay.  So ...  Where are you located?
L:  In Michigan.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Minneapoli- -- well, I'm in Saint -- yeah, I'm in -- near Minneapolis right now.  
R:  Oh, okay.  But they ask -- yeah, they ask where we were raised.  I'm not sure I understand what the study is for.  
L:  Neither do I but ...
R:  Yeah.  'Cause it's [MN] -- 'cause it seems like it has a lot to do with what kind of telephone you're using and I'm -- I'm guessing it has to do with dialect.  
L:  Mm.  Probably.  [MN]
R:  It's some kind of linguistic study.
L:  Okay.  
R:  But, yeah, I'm not sure.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, other than that what -- 'cause, yeah, they don't go into a lot of detail and ...
L:  Right.
R:  In some ways I guess it doesn't matter but it's just, you know, it's interesting.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I used to teach too.  I taught -- I don't have -- I'm not certified but I used to teach at a charter school for a while.
L:  Okay.  So did I.  And I taught overseas for a good seven -- almost six years.
R:  Oh.  I have a bunch of friends that did but I -- I've never done that.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  But back to censorship.
R:  That's right, yeah.  Okay.
L:  Better stay on the topic.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, go ahead.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  I guess the idea is -- is -- I guess the real -- the anti censorship idea is that they really aren't dangerous ideas.  You know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if someone -- you know, people are allowed to hold ideas and express them.
L:  Right.
R:  And it shouldn't be a threat to a society that's -- that's doing well.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, that -- that -- you know, if -- if there is that kind of opposition to ideas it means there's something wrong [LAUGH] and there's some kind of pathology in the society.
L:  Right.  And really, I think, right -- today [MN] what children are -- the way they're exposed to more violence is through television and video games, and that's something that parents are more the, you know, should be the arbiters of that.  
R:  Yeah.  I think also these days there seems to be less and less supervision by parents.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that they sort of have passed on -- well, it's not -- it's like the sort of per- -- you know, specialization, you know.  Peop- -- [LAUGH] you know, people have the children but then they pass on the -- the care of them to so many other people. 
L:  Right.  And school councilors and teachers too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, +whatever.  
R:  And it's like -- I don't know, I guess if I had children I'd want to be with them.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Otherwise I wouldn't have -- well, I don't have children.
L:  No.  
R:  But --
L:  Neither do I, so ...
R:  But I wou- I would if I -- yeah, if I were going to have children I'd want to spend a lot of time with them.
L:  Right.  And -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- also I would want to expose them to a wide variety of books and ideas and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, so censorship is something I definitely, for the most part, oppose.  Mm.
R:  [MN]  'Cause also like, who is -- yeah, who is deciding?
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]  What -- what do you teach in Michigan?
L:  Uh, I was teaching French actually.
R:  Oh.  I've -- I've a very good friend that got her doctorate in education but [MN] the main thing she teaches if French.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  She uses an accelerated method called suggestopedia[?].
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know if that's [inaudible].  So this, like, Bulgarian psychiatrist named Lazanoff[?].
L:  Mm.
R:  So -- I mean it was mainly used to teach languages in general but she happened to do it with French.  
L:  Oh, okay.  Never heard of it.  
R:  Yeah.  It's not that well known.  She's -- she's now in Amherst.
L:  Mm.
R:  And has started a little -- uh, she does some teaching, I think, at Holyoke but mainly she has this -- this company that does, like, this translation and language teaching.
L:  Oh, okay.  Interesting.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mm.
R:  I've been in France but very, very briefly.
L:  Okay.  
R:  It was -- it was just a -- we were on a trip to Europe to stop at a few places, and there was nowhere to stay in France so we kept going.
L:  Oh.  [MN]
R:  We -- we ended up in -- we were heading toward Italy and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we didn't stay in France overnight.  We just got on the overnight train and kept going because --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- there was some -- there was some big event --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- at the time.  And so we couldn't stay.  
L:  Mm.
R:  There was nowhere to stay.
L:  That's too bad.
R:  Yeah, I know.  So I got to spend a [MN] -- one day in [LAUGH] France.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  One day in Paris.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And that was about it.  
L:  Mm.  Well ...
R:  Do we ha- -- are we -- do we still have some time left?  Do we still need ...?
L:  I think so.  I guess it will tell us when it's been ten minutes, I think.
R:  Yeah, I would think so.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Have you always lived in Michigan?
L:  No, I lived in Tokyo for a long time and in Los Angeles --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Chicago before that.  [inaudible].  So, yeah, I've moved around a bit.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I like [inaudible].
R:  I think -- oh, I was born on the east coast near Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.
R:  So I've lived in, sort of, the border of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've lived in the twin cities for about sixteen, seventeen years now.
L:  Okay.  And what is it you do now?
R:  Oh, a lot of different things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- actually.  Mainly some -- some, like, uh, selling of electronics on ebay and some teaching.  What I -- what I'm looking to is work with home schoolers.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  'Cause the main thing I would teach is math.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And that's often a subject where they would have trouble, you know, finding --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- people.  
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  And I -- let's see, what was it?  [MN]  Uh, now I forgot.  [LAUGH]  I lost my thread.  Oh --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but I used -- uh, for the main -- the main career I've had over the years has been computer programmer.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  I did that for a long time but it's just gotten more difficult to find jobs.
L:  Mm.
R:  And so the stuff I've -- the stuff I've learned is not the same as, you know, they're -- they're learning a lot of new stuff now that I haven't done.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they won't -- usually won't hire you unless you've already done it.
L:  Okay.  See, yeah, I have a friend who's having the same problem.  Mm.
R:  So I thought of maybe learning -- I figure I might as well learn some more computer stuff that sounds interesting and go with that and see if I can get a job in it.  But at least then I'll have something that's interesting.  'Cause there's -- there's so much stuff to learn that I just -- I'm not that interested in learning.
L:  Right.
R:  And then -- and then I have to work in it.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So I might as well -- yeah.  That kind of thing.  So I figured I'd learn a language like pearl which is actually interesting from a language standpoint.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's a -- there's a topic called regular expressions.
L:  Mm.
R:  Where like it's sort of patterns of text, and using pearl especially is really strong with working with those kind of things, but there's a whole theoretical background that I thought would be interesting.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And it's also useful generally in computer science.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I thought it'd be an interesting topic to get into.  Whether I do it professionally or not.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I might as well enjoy it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause a lot -- a lot of the computer things seem very arbitrary to me.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, uh, it's -- it's been that way for a long time.  Not just Microsoft but IBM was like that too.
L:  Mm.
R:  Where you just had to memorize a lot of things.  It didn't really have that much meaning.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that happens in a foreign language too, but at least then you're learning something that's [MN] that's been very -- you know, been around for a really long time.  
L:  Right.
R:  With computers, it's like learning a foreign language, using it for six months and then not being able to use it anymore.
L:  Mm, that's -- yeah, that would be frustrating.
R:  And having to learn a different one.  And th- th- the patterns they -- they put together are very arbitrary.
L:  Mm.
R:  And often they'll change 'em to something worse.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So [several inaudible words] you've probably used Microsoft Word.
L:  Right.  Of course.
R:  That's like notorious for that.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, I don't know if they do -- I -- I guess they must signal us but it seems like we've been on for ten minutes or more.
L:  Seems like it but maybe not, uh, keep talking.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, I wonder --
R:  Do you -- how mu- --
L:  -- will we not get credit for going off from censorship 'cause they did say censorship.
R:  Oh, I know.  But, I -- I'm -- I'm guessing they just want to hear lang- -- well, I -- I suppose they just want to hear speech but I'm not really sure of that either.
L:  Right.
R:  There's also, uh, that you get -- you get paid for finding male recruits, but not women.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't know -- it maybe just be that it's harder to find men to do this?
L:  Maybe.  
R:  I don't ...  There's a lot of guessing on this.  [LAUGH]  I don't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- know what to --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what the whole thing is.  And I assume whatever we say is being recorded.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it has to be recorded 'cause they're --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- studying this.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's linguistics and not psychology.
L:  Right.  That's what I believe and then, I guess, regional makes -- makes up the different, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- parts of the country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which I think a lot of the regional accents are probably flattening out a little bit with everyone watching so much of the same televisions shows.
R:  And peop-
