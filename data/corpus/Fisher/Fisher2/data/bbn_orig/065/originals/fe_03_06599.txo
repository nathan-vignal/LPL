L:  Hello. 
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi my name is Judy.
R:  Okay I'm Trina.
L:  And where are you from? 
R:  I'm in Birmingham, Alabama.
L:  Oh, wow I'm in Topeka, Kansas.
R:  Okay.
L:  We're a long way away.  [LAUGH] I guess it's censorship on educate -- on books in the library for kids.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And I -- I think they have a right to censor some of it if it's sexual content or something like that, what do you think? 
R:  I think that yeah some stuff probably needs to be censored but some stuff goes too far as far as them taking [inaudible] and stuff out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't really agree with that but --
L:  Yeah that's kind of --
R:  I don't make the decisions.  [LAUGH]
L:  No I don't either.  I can understand them if they took out you know lewd and stuff like that but anything else I don't think that they have a right to take out I think -- I think by the time the kids are old enough to read the parents have probably instilled in them the type of stuff that they should be looking at.
R:  Supposedly.
L:  Yeah especially if they're in high school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's how I feel too when they get to be a certain age they should be able to read whatever is available and certain stuff shouldn't be banned I guess -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah that's -- that's the way I feel about it too I mean if it's you know if it's kindergarten through fourth grade you know it should bow censored, um, but it shouldn't be censored to where they take out historical things or you know war items or something because they think the content of it is too you know extreme for them.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, the teacher's should be able to teach what they should you know -- what they need to teach and they can leave out the parts that they don't you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And the teachers can recommend certain materials for them to have you know most kids at that age they're not just going to go and pick up a history book anyway, they're going to pick up --
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  -- you know.
R:  Something other than that.  [LAUGH]
L:  A four year old book you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Something that easy to read you know.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And then fifth grade through seventh or eighth grade they don't really have any thing in the library that should be censored and high school kids are the only ones that you know I think some of the romance novels that go into extreme sexual themes and stuff should be you know censored a little bit.
R:  Right.
L:  I think some of that's just you know a little bit lewd.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But the rest of them I don't think some you know be censored at all.
R:  But then it goes back to okay, um, the balance thing like, uh, they would almost -- certain video games or what ever to be played because of the violence like I guess they could probably say some stuff out because of you know violence kinds to go graphic violence content.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even if it is just a reading.
L:  Well I know that there are you know, um, video games that are very lewd.
R:  Right.
L:  I know that there is one that's on the market where, um, kids can get a hold of it if their parents buy it for them, which the parents you know the kids just say they want a game and the parents go buy it, they don't know what it is --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- because they don't play the games and they -- they, um, chase after you know they have cops chasing after them they can rape people on the streets and then turn around and shoot the cops and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know that there's a game like that on there and it's very lewd.
R:  All kind of craziness like that.
L:  So that that kind of stuff needs to be censored.  That stuff needs to be taken off the market.  [LAUGH] Little kid shouldn't have any kind of access to that. 
R:  Right.
L:  Big kids shouldn't have any access -- adults shouldn't have any access --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to that.
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH] So.
R:  But then there's that thing of okay well where do you draw the line so --
L:  Yeah it's -- yeah some people are just you know it's like --
R:  Where should be draw, but then again who should.
L:  Yeah who should be telling us what we can and can't.
R:  Especially if someone else does.
L:  Who -- who is to tell us what we can or can't you know read or look at or 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  You know.
R:  So the whole basis of this was like the voucher thing for us.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  The censorship -- I didn't -- I guess I didn't really hear it real good okay, um, 
L:  I didn't my husband answered the phone so I'm not too sure what they said.
R:  Okay.
L:  He just handed it to me and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- cause he pushed a button and told them I was unavailable for thirty second so they said after three seconds then press -- we'll give you the main menu again so they did.
R:  Okay.
L:  I was listening to a book on tape and I didn't hear him holler at me from the phone.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [COUGH] But yeah the censorship is kind of a touchy deal.
R:  Yep.
L:  You know and it's really not going to matter a whole heck of lot what our opinion is, it's going to boil down to you know what the Chairman and Congressman and --
R:  Yeah of course.  
L:  -- Mayor's and everybody else say it's not going to have to do with the voters.
R:  Yep who's ever pay the most money.
L:  That's right whoever has got the most money in the pocket wins.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Whether they're the good person or the bad person.
R:  Yep doesn't really matter.
L:  Nope weird deal.  We had -- is this your second call or first call that you've had? 
R:  This is the first one I've had it's interesting.
L:  This is the second one I've had.  The first one I had was hobbyist and it was really neat because it was on crafts and they're getting a little tougher now.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  This is the second one on censorship kind hard you know cause everybody has their own opinion you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But I don't know that it really matters what our opinion's going to be because I don't think that we're going to get to vote on it.  It's going to be what the Congressman and them decide.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But I don't think that they should be censoring you know historical books or anything like that the only thing I feel that should be censored is stuff that contains strong sexual content you know it's not really going to matter if it has strong words in it you know as far as dirty words or something like that because the kids hear that at home anyway but --
R:  I know and that's probably what they're to get away from just because it's common place does want mean that something that you should actually do.
L:  Yeah exactly.
R:  It's something that you should say is okay for your kids.
L:  Yeah and you know if parents teach their kids right from wrong then you know all that they can do is instill the right morals in them and hope that their kid does okay by it but then there is some.
R:  And then again there is the big [inaudible] thing because okay maybe you're doing all that you're supposed to be doing but if other parent is not then your child is still going to be influenced by that child whose parents is not doing what they should be doing.
L:  That's true -- that's true too -- that's very true cause there's a lot of parents who don't.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  I've seen that lot of times.  [LAUGH] I don't -- I don't know what to think about it -- my kids are grown and not in school anymore and we didn't have these issues when my kids were in school you know my last --
R:  My kid is not in school yet seeing how he's not two yet.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Mine are all grown.
R:  It's a lot of things I'm having to start thinking about now --
L:  I've got -- 
R:  -- as to where.
L:  -- I have got a twenty five year old over the road truck driver and a twenty four your old that's pregnant with my second grandchild.
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  She's married and -- and then I've got a young son that will be twenty one in June second so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- mine are out of school and don't have to be censored anymore.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] They're old enough to make up their own mind so this one's kind of hard for me.
R:  Yep and I'm just get nothing to the point where I am having to think about it okay.  Do I need censorship in schools now.
L:  [LAUGH] Well censorship on some of the things they do need -- you know I don't think that need to be teaching things sex education to kids in third grade you know with sexual material from the library and stuff like I think that's a little too young to be teaching that.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's just you know every parent has their different ideas about things and it's -- I don't think it's going to be left up to the voters anyway.  I think it's going to be left up to you know like I said the Senators, the Congressman, Mayor's or whoever makes the decisions higher up.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I don't think it's going to come down to citizen vote but I don't -- I don't think that there is a lot of materials that need to be censored. 
R:  Right.
L:  That there's you know I'm not sure what's all in even in high school books anymore or junior high school books you know in the libraries.  We never had anything you know -- my kids were raised in a small town and they never had anything I -- you know the kids would bring home library books and I never seen anything that was lewd or you know that should be censored or even in teaching materials you know they didn't teach sex education until ninth grade and by then they all need [inaudible] -- know it by then anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  So it wasn't anything that you know I needed to worry about but now I -- you know there must be something out there somewhere that needs to be censored or -- or people think needs to be censored.
R:  Well like you said I'm a person because when I was in school which is like maybe six seven years ago we read, um, a book called like native son and another one calls black boy.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And both of those have very strong content in them like towards the beginning or whatever just to get you -- I guess in the right frame of mind to actually think about certain things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that could possibly be questionable depending on who was reading it and you know what their frame of mind or whatever it is when they're reading it cause like I said we didn't get to that until like maybe eleventh or twelfth grade --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and by then you should be mature enough to you know go passed it and actually get to the root of the story you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those were just details.
L:  And there are you know there are some kids who are
