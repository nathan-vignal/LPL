R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Regina.  I'm from New York.
L:  Oh, my goodness [LAUGH], I'm Sheila from Oregon. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, hi, how are you?
L:  [MN] Quite a while -- ways away, huh [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah, yes.  They said that th- -- the topic is divorce and has divorce changed our -- my -- attitudes or behaviors, I believe.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  I do- -- I've al- -- [MN] do you wanna go first [LAUGH]?  Or do you want me --
L:  Yeah, go ahead.
R:  Okay --
L:  No, you go ahead today [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  Well, I -- I'm married, I'm married --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for sixteen years now, and --
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- I've never been divorced.  Um, I -- I don't think it's changed my behavior at all, because I -- you know, I think I -- my husband and I [MN] knew each other as friends beforehand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that's why I think, you know, it kinda was friendship and then, you know, it developed later --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, [MN] um, so I think as far as us [SIGH], I mean, we just -- we just deal with everything together, and I think we've been through a lot in our lives and -- just because we've -- we've had a friendship to start, I think that's helped a lot.  So, I don't think it's -- it's altered our behavior just because of the way we started out, pretty much.  How 'bout you?  Are you married?
L:  [LAUGH] No, divorced twice.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  My, uh, feeling is that I don't need a man any more.  They just kinda get in my way and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [MN] frankly they -- they are -- they're good for one thing and [LAUGH] they don't do that very well, either, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- it's not that I don't, you know, I definitely don't prefer women, [MN] but I don't have any use for 'em any more.  They just -- I married two losers --
R:  Oh, that's it, you got burned twice.
L:  Yeah, and -- you know, I got great children out of both of 'em, but, um, I'm fifty and [MN] no thanks.  Yes, it has definitely altered my opinion of [SIGH] -- what, was it marriage?  Divorce has altered my opinion of what?
R:  Of divorce, or behave- -- your behavior?  But I'm --
L:  Oh, my behavior?  Oh, you bet --  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you bet.  I -- my -- my attitude is I can do it myself, or I can do it better than a male [MN].
R:  Y- -- you know, actually, I think -- I think you're right.  And I think that a lot of women find that -- that, you know, it's like -- it -- it's sometimes better to go it alone than to go, you know, if it's not gonna be good.  Uh --
L:  Well, if they're not gonna work, and they're gonna sit there and watch me work twenty hours a day -- [MN] I mean -- [MN] actually, I can think of a worse word than [MN] -- you know, heck with them, I'm -- you know --
R:  [MN] I don't blame you, sure.
L:  I'm not gonna support 'em any more, and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- it seemed to be that way.  I -- maybe that's just the kind of males I picked, but I'm not interested, no thank you.
R:  [MN] I don't blame you, because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the thing is, if -- if you wanted somebody who would watch you work, you would have another child.
L:  [LAUGH] You bet.  I got three of those, um --
R:  Yes?
L:  -- you know -- [MN] fifteen, seventeen -- actually sixteen tomorrow -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and, um, seventeen and thirty, so, yep, they're just about all -- all gone and I can't wait [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  So --
R:  Then you really --
L:  -- but yes, it definitely has altered --
R:  Um, mine are little.  I have a seven year old and I have two year old twins.
L:  Oh, my gosh -- oh, no way, no -- [LAUGH] no way.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I -- you know, you have child- -- mother always said you have children when you're younger because you can't handle them when you're older, and I -- I believe it.  I -- 
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- I couldn't do it.  I think about that, I go, "No" [LAUGH]. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, we -- we get very tired very easily here [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I don't remember the, uh, second question --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- or the second comment I guess.
R:  Uh --
L:  Do you remember what it said?
R:  -- no, I think it was -- it was -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I actually -- I don't remember it either.  I -- I just remembered if it changed your attitude about, I guess, divorce and --
L:  About marriage, no, was it marriage?
R:  -- or marriage.  Marriage.
L:  Yeah, I think.  And something about -- oh heck, I don't remember.  I don't remember.
R:  No, I don't either.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Are you an RMCer?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Oh, my gosh, so am I.
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm Sheila from Oregon, I occasionally write in.  I used to, um, work for the largest newspaper in, um, [LIPSMACK] in the Pacific Northwest --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I kinda knew a lot about [MN] those slicks and everything like that --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yes, yes.
L:  -- you know.  Yeah, occasionally I'll write in, but --
R:  Yeah, no, occasionally I do -- but I have more questions than answers [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Cool.
R:  I definitely have more questions than answers.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, good, when I see your name -- are you Regina from New York then?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Okay, great, when I see you I'll know who I'm talking to then [LAUGH].
R:  Thank you.  Oh, that's a great -- I just -- I figured there are gonna be a lot of us [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  I think so for -- thank heavens for Jeanette -- I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know what we'd do without her.
R:  Yes.
L:  Golly.  But ... [SIGH]
R:  I appreciate her a lot.  But, it's funny, 'cause even that -- I mean, I -- I -- my husband, we were laughing, 'cause he says, "You spend a lotta time doing that", I said, "I get a lot out of it" [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, mhm, yes.  Yes, I just plain enjoy it, and then [MN] --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- I have access to a lot of, um, newspapers, obviously --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- since I just recently left the business, so I'm [SIGH] -- you know, a lot of stockpiling and stuff like that, so --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- we're having a garage sale this Friday, and --
R:  Oh, good.  How's the weather?
L:  [SIGH] Crappy --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- it's cold and very overcast and so ...
R:  That's pretty much what we're having here [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  It's Memorial Day weekend and Fourth of July, it usually rains really hard, so --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, golly.  
R:  So that's it -- we have that too.  But I know I live -- 'cause he was just telling me today, he goes, "It takes a lot of your time", I said, "I love it, this is my outlet" [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm, mhm, you bet.  Especially when it's something like this -- this is fun, even though we're totally strayed from the top- -- topic of family values --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LAUGH] but, I don't know, hobbies maybe are family values.  You could kinda --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- link 'em both in there and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and good ones, and [MN] ones that are, I don't know, advantageous to the whole group [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know.  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  No.  But I -- I know, I love that [LAUGH].  Well, that's the way -- it's funny too, because I sai- -- I said to him, 'cause I don't know, somebody had a comment, like last week or some- -- I only get to look at the -- the -- you know, the website [SIGH] like maybe three or four days a week [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and somebody made a comment about -- something about a three year old chewing gum, [SIGH] and I was like, "A three year old chewing gum?" [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he goes, "What are you reading there?  What do people write on there?"  I said, "We find out all kinds of stuff" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] My children are at -- well, if they chewed gum that early it would just fall out of their mouth when they were walking, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they had no idea what they were to do with it, and I'm like, "No, no more of this, guys" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  But that's it.  And then -- and then of course I always tell him, "Oh, yeah, you know, they write about their D.D." and he goes, "What is it?"  I said, "It depends on the context" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  Or their D.H. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I said, "It definitely depends on the context".
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, sure.  Golly.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, no, I love that.  I love that web board.  It's my -- that's my outlet.
L:  Mhm.  Yup, besides kids and work and ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yup, that's where I go [MN].
R:  No [MN].  So, yours are gonna be out -- well, you -- is your thirty year old out of the house?
L:  [MN] Oh yeah, has been married for ten years, you bet --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  Oh.
L:  She just lives in town, and [MN] most of my family does, so --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- my blasted brother showed up last night.  He lives over the mountain from us, and [MN] -- he had a Jeep on the back of his trailer behind his pickup [MN].  He said, "Let's trade", so he -- I gave him my old ninety and he gave me a two thousand Jeep, just [MN] -- [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he didn- -- he made a -- a decision that my Jeep was junk, and so that I needed a new one.  And I didn't really have a problem with my old one, but he decided that he was gonna get rid of the old one, so [MN] now I'm driving a pretty n- -- nice looking Jeep, I guess --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- [LAUGH] so, I don't know.  
R:  Oh, that's pretty good.  His little visit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was worthwhile [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess.  [LAUGH] I don't know [MN] -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he does things like that, so we were raised with very good family values [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] That's -- well, that helps --
L:   Mm.
R:  -- boy, I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I'd keel over if my brother ever came to me with a car [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What are you?  
L:  Nah.
R:  Just wouldn't expect that at all. 
L:  No, I guess we all look out for each other.
R:  That's good, that's very nice.
L:  So ...  No -- got a big family.  How many are in yours?  I've got --
R:  Oh, I just have one brother.
L:  Oh, my, oh, I've got four sisters and a brother.  One passed away, but still got [MN] three sisters, one brother and my mom and [SIGH] -- god, she's seventy two, and we bought her a computer when she was seventy --
R:  [MN]
L:  Partly for the refunding [MN] -- the R.M.C., right?
R:  Good for her.
L:  And she met somebody on the internet, and now --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- sh- -- he moved in with her.
R:  Wow.
L:  She's seventy two and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  Good for her.
L:  -- acting like a kid [LAUGH].  I don't know ...
R:  Good for her, boy.
L:  I know.  She didn't want the computer and the internet in the first place.  She just really was kinda angry at the gift, and then [SIGH] after she -- yeah, she doesn't know what she would of done without it, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Gee.
L:  That's kinda --
R:  So, is she planning on getting married?
L:  [MN] I think she is, yeah.  I really --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- think she is, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Seventy two, God.  Oh, yeah, better than sitting around in an old folks' home saying, "Oh, if I --"
R:  Yeah, what am I gonna do?
L:  "-- only I'd done different", you know?
R:  Right.  
L:  Yeah, so, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  Gee, so you're gonna have to plan a wedding, huh [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH] For my mother, ooh --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- that's kinda weird [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It is kinda weird [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] So, anyway --
R:  But you know how to do it inexpensively, that's for sure [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, yes, I do [LAUGH].
R:  Oh --
L:  Thank gosh.
R:  -- that's great.
L:  Mm.
R:  Wow, that's amazing.  Um, my -- my dad is eighty three, he's gonna be eighty four --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, wow.
R:  -- next month.  And it's funny, because I said he would be one of these people, that if he would let us get the computer, and set it up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he would be on it all the time.  'Cause he's very active man --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he's always, like, into this and looking up this and -- and what a -- what do they say about this, and all --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- but he won't do it.  He's very -- he's always been very resistant to any kinda technology.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I remember my mother and I fought him to get a microwave.  And then of course --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he's the one that used it the most.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  I think we fought him to get the VCR and then, all of a sudden he's taping everything [SIGH].  But we always laugh, 'cause my husband he would say, he goes, "If we could just get it in his house [SIGH] --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- he would be one of these people that would be sitting for six hours --"
