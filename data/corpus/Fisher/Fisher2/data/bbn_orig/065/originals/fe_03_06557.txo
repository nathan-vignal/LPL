R:  Brew.
L:  Hi, Arkie.
R:  Okay.  And I didn't catch all the question.
L:  Neither did I [LAUGH].  I -- I believe --
R:  Something about family values.
L:  I -- I believe it was something about employer checking -- checking, uh, uh, about drugs and other histories --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- when applying for a job.
R:  Okay.  I have no problem with that.
L:  Um, I don't either.  I'm not about drugs.  I don't think it really violates your privacy.
R:  No, I do not.  In fact, I -- I feel -- feel like it is good for the mere fact that I don't want my coworker to be strung out on drugs --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and me -- and who knows, [MN] you know, apparently some people on the wrong drugs, they get violent and that type of stuff.  And I don't need that in my workplace.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  Me too, I totally agree with that. 
R:  And the -- this is my first time call.  How 'bout you?
L:  [MN] First call, myself too.  How did you hear about this program?
R:  Um, I belong to a website -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- about refunding --
L:  Oh, my goodness, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Are you on R.M.C.?
L:  Ye- -- yes --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- refunding makes cents.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What is your name?
R:  Brew, in Kentucky.
L:  Brew in Kentucky.  My name is Arkie.  I'm from Minnesota.
R:  Okay.  And do you post much?
L:  Uh -- not -- I have posted a couple of times --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that's about it.
R:  I -- I post only when I find a good deal.  I am -- I'm not like Jeanette, the one that -- that I got a --
L:  Oh, yes, Jeanette from Minnesota?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes.  She always finds good deals.  And there's another one, Princess Ann.
R:  Yes.  
L:  I don't know where is she from, but she has lot of stuff that she posts.
R:  I -- I agree.  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH] And I just feel like I am a novice.  I have no clue about where they get all these deals.
R:  Me either.  But --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- I guess -- I don't kn- -- I'm sure -- are they recording this?  I didn't know whether we needed to stay on the subject [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I guess we should.  But [MN] I h- -- worked twice in the past and both the jobs, one for two months and one for six months, and um, they did both the checkings.  And I was totally all right with those checkings, I have no problem.  [SIGH] I think somebody who would have a problem would be somebody who is involved in those things.  Like if you take drugs, uh, you would have the problem.
R:  I agree, and -- now, the -- the business that I work in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I have been there fifteen years, so I have never been -- when I was hired --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was not something they did.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But in the job, it does not affect me, but there's -- I work for a utility company, electric company --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the guys that work on the crews, or work on the lines, they are required to do the drug testing.  And they come in --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- out of the blue sometimes and say, "Okay, this morning we're having drug test".
L:  Okay.
R:  And I don't know if those people, I guess, pa- -- fr- -- I don't think any of our guys do --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but there's some people that --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, when they've had the random ones like that, they maybe feel like it's invasion of their privacy.  I don't know, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to me, if you've go- -- you know, you know that going in, you know working at this company --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that you are subject to random drug tests.  If you don't like it, there's the door.
L:  Right, right [LAUGH].  Absolutely, and --
R:  That's how I feel about it.
L:  -- and I guess it's also big corporations that -- that do this.  If you probably work for a small, uh, mom and pop store or a relatively --
R:  No, no, nope.
L:  -- small -- they wouldn't -- they wouldn't check this for you.  I -- I ha- -- I think this applies so much to sportsmen with performances so much, uh, affected by [LIPSMACK] taking drugs like steroids.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I personally think they definitely need to be tested before a match, after they're -- after their match or whatever, performance is over, because they -- they can win or lose.  It's like a big -- that's a really big situation.
R:  Well, take the horse racing industry --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they -- they test them, you know th- -- it's -- bef- -- long ago, you couldn't run on lasiks, and now you can run on lasiks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and this type stuff.  So, I mean, it's regulated too, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I'm -- we're in agreement.  We don't, you know --
L:  We don't disagree about this, yeah. 
R:  Right, right.  
L:  Right.
R:  But then there was something about [MN] -- they said the subject of the day was family values ...
L:  Was it?  I -- I -- I did not catch that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but we -- we can talk about it, if -- if you think that was one of the subjects, we can talk about it.
R:  Well, basic -- when I first got on the phone, it said, um, "Today's subject is family va- -- family values" --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and then they went on and they sa -- you know, p- put in your pin number and that type stuff, and then you have to, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- said, "Hold on, we'll see if somebody's gonna connect --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that type stuff, and then, um, then they said the question --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, um, like I said, this is my first time.  I tried yesterday to call in and no one connected up with me.
L:  Okay [NOISE].
R:  And so, um, but this -- this is interesting, and I hope I get my five calls and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not just three calls.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] You know, how -- until when is this research going on?
R:  I didn't understand you.
L:  Until when are they going to have this research going on? [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  I don't know.  And I don't -- and -- and it's supposed to be something ab- -- the research, my understanding on the study was to, how do you gather your information.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So, anyway.  But as far as family values, I feel like they are going down because of the TV, internet --
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  -- and the sex and violence and all that stuff that you see in the movies --
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  -- because I have two teenagers and just --
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  Yeah, I have two teenage boys.
L:  Oh, okay.  I have two kids and they're -- they -- one is two, one is five.  And I -- I totally agree with you, even about the movies.  The kind of crap that they show --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm sorry to use that word, but i- it's -- it's --
R:  It is.  It's junk.
L:  -- it is really, it's really sad that you have to expose -- and how many times can you keep on flipping or forwarding?  And then it becomes too conscious, the kids feel [SIGH] that was something interesting that mom didn't want me to see.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They would probably go back and rewind it after we had gone [MN].  You know, like, if you're busy doing a ru- -- running an errand, like you're doing the laundry or something, they -- they find the time to [inaudible] -- can't -- it's -- it's -- I -- I really don't know what to do.  [NOISE] Absolutely.
R:  Well, you- you- you're doing right about monitoring it, and also that, um, um, if -- if, for some reason you -- you got a movie that you jus- -- didn't realise --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was in there.  As far as fast forwarding and then, if you have to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- put the movie up or, um, if you've rented it, make a mental note to never rent that again, or even make a list --
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  -- of what not to -- what --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you don't want to rent again.  But when yours are that small, you can do -- you know, y- you -- you're mainly doing Disney and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and that type --
L:  Right, the animated stuff.
R:  -- and the animated stuff.
L:  [NOISE] You know, but when they show even the animals, you know, it -- i- i- it may be -- it may be very routine for somebody, but even -- even those things for me can be [SIGH] -- can be -- I don't -- I don't like when they show animals, like, kissing and hugging, and, you know -- not in a nice way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, my kid, my little five year old, she thinks that, you know, [MN] she asks me why can't she marry her little brother.  And I said, "You know, brothers and sisters don't get married".
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And then she said, you know, "But you married Dada".  I said, "He's not my brother".
R:  Right, right.
L:  And you don't pro- -- you know --
R:  They don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at that age they don't quite -- they don't quite get it.
L:  Get it.
R:  And they will, it will come.  Now, is your daughter in kindergarten?
L:  No, she will be going to kindergarten this year. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  
L:  But not if it -- and I -- I just cannot answer -- I don't know how to answer her questions.  I mean they -- they are innocent, I understand, but those things, why would those things come to her mind?  Because she is exposed to them so much.
R:  Just a kid.  I -- I mean, I wouldn't think anything of it. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's good [LAUGH]. That's good, it's good to know that.
R:  I mean -- an- an- -- and I'm not trying to downplay your concern --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I wouldn't -- I wouldn't think anything of it.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, just answer her questions, say, "No, you -- that just won't happen", you know, "That can't happen".
L:  Right.
R:  An- -- and just tell her [MN], "Some day, later in life, you -- you will find someone like I found Daddy".
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That -- that's a -- that's a good way of saying it.  I will try that, I definitely will.
R:  But I mean, and -- and she's -- you know, [MN] her whole world is --
L:  Dolls and [LAUGH] --
R:  -- you and your husband, an- and her brother, and probably a few friends, say from church or fr- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from preschool or something like that, so she --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it's just -- it's all innocent.  It's -- so ...
L:  But you know how it -- it scares me, it really does.
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN] I mean --
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible].
L:  -- it's not necessary that only the media is to blame, but, uh, it -- it can scare you.  
R:  Ye- --
L:  Oh gosh, I hope I'm doing the right thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for my kids, and -- oh, Lord [SIGH].
R:  Well, with mine being teenagers, I mean, it's just -- th- -- it -- it's scary [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  With teenagers, I think, it -- it just gets really more scary.
R:  Yes.
