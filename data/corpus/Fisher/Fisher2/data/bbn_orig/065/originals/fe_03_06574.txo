R:  Hi.  Jay.
L:  Hi, I'm Whitney.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm [LAUGH] fine, thank you.  
R:  And has the -- the divorce rate changed your attitude or your -- your --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- uh, whatever?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't really know.  Um, I mean, uh, uh, I, myself, don't know very many people who are divorced.  I guess I still consider myself relatively young and, uh -- so most of my friends, um, [MN], uh, who are the greatest influence on me, um, are either single or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] relatively newly married.  Right?  
R:  [MN]  Uh-huh.
L:  Not divorced yet.  So, I don't know if it's had much of a -- an affect on me.  How 'bout you?
R:  Well, I -- I -- I've -- I've been married, uh, almost twenty and, uh --
L:  I'm sorry?  You've -- you've married?
R:  I've -- I've been married almost twenty years.
L:  Oh -- oh, you have?  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know.  It's, uh, I know that I think [MN] -- the last I saw, somewhere in the vic- [MN] vicinity of, um, first time marriages are like, I don't know, [MN] thirty to forty percent fail or something in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the first five years or something.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or ...
L:  But do you actually -- you see, I guess it -- when I see figures cited in a newspaper I don't really -- it doesn't really affect me as much as -- as what I see happening with my friends and -- and acquaintances.  Right?  That affects me much more.  
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, I just don't know that many divorced people.  Um, I mean, I know people who have been in long term relationships but haven't been married and then have broken up and it's been ugly.  But, um, um, as far as [MN] people getting married and divorced, not so many.  I mean, do you have, I don't know, is it too personal a question to ask if you have friends or acquaintances who are -- or maybe even relatives who've been married and divorced?
R:  Yeah, in, uh, all of them.  I've had, uh, family, have --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [MN] acquaintances. 
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, [MN] you know, somewhat known 'em well and -- but it seems to be that I -- I would think you could put your, or at least in my case, there's five or six main reasons why.  Financial, uh, just, you know, the old "we grew apart" theory or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- whatever. 
L:  Mm.
R:  It's a combination, whatever claim that is or ...  Um, you know, stuff like that but, uh -- I mean, I don't -- I mean, I've -- I wouldn't say my twenty years have been all bliss but --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, you know, I -- if I had a do it all over again I would the same way.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, you know, there's been ups and downs, like everything else and, uh, you know, there is -- I -- I would -- I -- I -- in my opinion, I don't know what she would say, but I -- I don't think we've ever came close to even think of talking to lawyers or everything.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, we've all had our -- or at least I've -- uh, my age group have had our fights where you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you don't talk for a week or -- but I mean no one's ever moved out or--
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or, uh, you know.  Yeah, uh, we slept in, uh, separate room maybe a night or two and doors slamming and that kind of stuff over the years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But nothing ever physical or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- throwing or any of that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- stuff.  But, uh, you know, she --
L:  But somehow you always made up in the end, right?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, u- usually -- uh, and I would say more a percentage of the time was my fault.  You know, just --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, you know, --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- inconsiderate, the -- the usual.  You know, you didn't call or, uh, yeah, maybe you bought something without con- -- [MN] a major something without, uh, discussion or, you know -- or, and your typical, just, uh, somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed stuff, too. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  For little and big.  But, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, [MN] but I -- and I think it's just a -- I don't know, I don't [MN] --
L:  Do you think some people -- do you think some people are just less tolerant of conflict than -- or they just don't know how to deal with conflict?
R:  Yeah, I think that's a major thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I -- you know, I do see [MN] there, you know, I can see how people do, uh, uh, grow [MN] -- grow apart, uh, if you don't work at it.  I mean, we've -- our kids are, uh, we have one left at home and, uh, she's looking at colleges and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, [several inaudible words] we've had four at home at one time, well we're down to one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It is a lot more time together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a lot more, you know, less, uh, less jockeying.  Everybody drives now and, uh, you know, everybody's somewhat self sufficient so it leaves a l- little more time that you two are together and ...
L:  Is that a good thing?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, if you're -- again, if you're on the same page.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, you know, if you're both in -- you know, enjoy whatever and, uh, either working around the house or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, just, you know, [MN] or a vacation.  You know, you don't have to -- to us, at least in my situation, we don't have to, uh, [MN] you know, we don't have to be an out to dinner every Saturday [MN] night type of couple.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  We just play it by ear now and we're just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- somewhat glad we do have the free time and the stress and the, you know, the --
L:  Uh, that's interesting.  I -- I -- I, myself, have a -- have a boyfriend and I find sometimes if we spend too much time together, you know, like three days in a row I'll feel like I -- I need a break, you know.  I want a, you know, like a day to myself or something.  
R:  Oh, yeah, we all need that.
L:  Um, and then I -- I'll always end up missing him, right.  You know, like, I -- you know, then I -- then I'll want to see him again, but I -- it is possible to, um, um, at least for me, to spend too much time, uh, with my boyfriend.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We can do that too.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, yeah, so you know -- but you could be under the same roof doing something differently and -- and -- and --
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  -- be separate and not be on top of each other.  
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  You know.  Uh, my wife is, uh, loves to sit in the sun and, uh, read a book or something or a magazine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she's completely content.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, I'm not that big of a sun person --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, uh, you know, I don't mind, uh, you know, whatever.  I can be in the downstairs watching a ball game or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whatever, but the considerate person would, you know, every two or three hours just poke your head in, "Hey you need anything?"
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  And, "What's up?" or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, if you starts living in the basement and she's living it outside --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- well then you got problems.  You know.
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.  
R:  And, you know, and now it's, uh, what do you feel like, you know, you're not cooking [MN] a meal for five people. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's what do you feel?  You know, now we end up just picking up something quick somewhere when -- we don't cook anymore.
L:  Right.
R:  It's not worth it.  And, uh, what do you feel like tonight?  What do you feel like?  Give and go and, uh -- I'm lucky.  We're -- we're on the same page on a lot of things.  
L:  Have you ever tried to discourage a friend from getting a divorce or filing for divorce?
R:  No, but I, uh, it [MN] -- as I said before, I have, uh, [MN] twentyish year old as a couple and the new dating scene is completely different than what I went through or [MN] understand or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- whatever.  The -- this generation of mine, at least, they, uh, they, uh, they're not looking to, uh -- commitment is not in the top ten.
L:  No?
R:  No.  They're, uh --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They're, uh, you know -- they all have friends and everybody, you know, they [MN] -- I don't -- it's not -- I wouldn't say it's wacky, it's just a new -- it's a new way of living.  Other, uh -- they're, uh, they're more concerned about -- or they just want their own time and their own space and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't want that having to call every night and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even not living together but just, you know, checking in everyday.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh ...
L:  I think one thing that makes it difficult nowadays is that, um, jobs are so mobile, right?
R:  Yep.
L:  And, uh, and -- and people also so desperate for jobs that they're willing to move to many different places.  Um, so it's -- it's harder I think to, um, to set up a house somewhere and be assured that both, um, uh, members of the couple can be employed.  Right?
R:  Right.
L:  Um, um, and -- and some jobs just do require a lot of, uh, a lot of travel.  Right?
R:  And in this day and age, you know --
L:  So people just do end up spending a lot of time apart.
R:  And in this day and age it's -- you -- you almost need the two incomes.
L:  Oh, yeah.  For su- -- yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know -- and, uh, it's -- it's, you know, these -- [MN] these kids are my money's my money and your money's your money and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, maybe we have to share once in a while, but it's -- everything's separate and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh ...  I don't know, I'm not saying they're wrong but, uh, you know, no one's in a rush into, uh, you know, start the, uh, the -- the goal of the white picket fence and two kids and all that.
L:  Right.
R:  There's no, uh -- there's no concern [MN], which is fine if that's the way they want to -- at least in my house if that's the way they want to live, you know, that's the way they want to live, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do I c- -- what do I care?  So long as they're not hitting me up every week.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  But I think, uh, in relationships, in theirs or in mine for twenty years, if you don't put the effort in it's not going to work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, you got to.  It's constant.  You know.  Some days or some weeks you don't put in as much as you did the week before but if you're not +cognizance of the other person and -- and -- and in touch with some of their feelings and their thoughts on certain issues you're just asking for trouble.
L:  So, um, did you -- did you raise your kids to be, um, you know, to be sensitive to other people's feelings and how other people are -- uh, react- -- you know, other people's reactions so that maybe, um, they'll be better at long term relationships?
R:  You try to but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, you know it's, uh -- there's a big influence out there of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, you know, TVs and movies and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just everyday --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- life and, uh, you know, they want the, uh, the -- the Volvo or the Saab or the --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, they don't want the used car and build up and save some money.  It's -- they don't worry about ten years from now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They --
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're just living from day to day or month to month and, you know, they don't c- -- you know, you talk to 'em about, well, ten year-
