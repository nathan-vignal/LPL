R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Karen.
R:  Hi, I'm Denise.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, Denise.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from, um [LIPSMACK], northern California, outside of San Francisco.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Illinois, right out --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- right outside of Chicago.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Uh -- 
L:  I hope I don't lose you, 'cause I am on my cell phone, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah, actually, I was hoping you were a date [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] So [SIGH] --
L:  Anyhow, um, you know, the thing that -- that I think with this whole drug testing [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is I think sometimes it can be an invasion of privacy [LIPSMACK].  Um, and the reason is, it -- I think that sometimes that it's done without just cause.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- well, I --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I feel that it -- it also -- it determines, like, 'cause there are people out there that are on drugs, you know, certain drugs, for like --
L:  Yeah, [inaudible].
R:  -- for cancer, or for, you know --
L:  Prescriptions, and yeah, that's what I mean, I --
R:  And prescriptions and so on, and that is an invasion.  Now, when it comes to just regular [NOISE] teenagers or younger adults, or even older ones in that case, [NOISE] I personally am against drugs, so when it comes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to the drug testing at work, I agree with it, because -- I don't know, it's just -- it keeps the worst --
L:  I don't like -- I don't -- I think that there has to be a policy of how they administer it --
R:  Yeah, there, yeah --
L:  -- if you know what I'm saying.
R:  -- there should be -- there should be a policy.  Like, I've worked at companies that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you were notified seventy two hours in advance --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, your name could be popped up within, you know, within a year randomly, but it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you had a [inaudible] -- it's not like you've got pot, you know, okay, let's go take a drug test now.  You had seventy two hour advance notice.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, you know, so that I agree with.  But I don't agree with the companies that just, you know, you have to take it right now or you're fired. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I --
R:  That's wrong.
L:  -- I think that there are certain cases that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- let -- let me just [several inaudible words] because I'm kind of [several inaudible words] company, and they say the drug test you should know already up front --
R:  Right.
L:  [several inaudible words].  Second of all, that, uh [LIPSMACK], one of the things that -- about that is, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there has to be some law that prohibits them from testing for anything but illegal drugs.  
R:  Right, yeah, so they should -- there should -- 'cause I do know there are tests out there that test for only illegal drugs.
L:  Right.
R:  And they -- that's what they should be testing for, not the prescription --
L:  Uh, prescript- --
R:  -- ones or --
L:  -- or anything else.
R:  Right. 
L:  And then, once that -- in -- actually, it should be done by a third party, and not the -- not the employer.
R:  Right, yeah.  See, almost every company that I've worked for it's always done by, like, a hospital --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, you know, an acute care center type thing, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's never been done by them, indirectly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  And, you know, just making sure that -- that the employee's rights are -- you know, I really think the employee's rights also have a right to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, protected.
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Um, because if it's not something that is going to -- you know, I can see that if you're a railroad -- person running the railroad, person running in a high -- a job that's going to actually affect public safety, yes --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- okay, but if you are someone sitting back in human resources, you know, typing up a letter there's degrees in which --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when drug testing should happen.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, I -- my children accidentally knocked the phone [MN] out of the jack, sorry.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, what I was saying was, you know, I think there -- if you're, you know, running the railroad, or running something --
R:  Oh, yeah, yes, definitely.  I mean --
L:  Versus --
R:  -- I -- I personally, when it comes to, like, honestly, like marijuana [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] I mean, I don't do it myself.  I do know of people that do do it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, [NOISE] like you were saying, when it comes to certain jobs [MN] --
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  -- there's -- there's a -- I guess you could say there's a thin line.  I personally, there's people that I know that do it just on occasion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they do it on the weekends, when they're not even at work --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I don't care.  Yes, I don't -- would -- don't want, you know, my kids doing it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they're gonna experiment when they're older, [NOISE] all kids do [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just --
L:  And the more you sa- -- and the more you say no, the more the kids will do it.
R:  Ri- -- oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  You know.
R:  I'd -- I'd honestly say that's why I started smoking in the first place when I was, you know, thirteen, fourteen years old.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm. 
R:  Is because my mom prohibited it.  Now, yes, I did experiment with drugs, but I never got into it into it.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] But I don't know if I would of kept going if she would have told me no, but she never, you know.  You'd say she nev- -- may not have really known about it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, then the other thing too is I beli- -- and this is what I tell people if I'm at a party or something like that, and, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I do not like the fact that marijuana is illegal, therefore I don't like being around it.  But I totally believe that marijuana should be legal, especially --
R:  You know what, I've d- --
L:  What?
R:  -- I've heard studies on, you know, it kills brain cells, oh and it does this.  Yes, and I agree with when it comes to heroin or cocaine or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] those are even -- those are even worse drugs than any out there.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I just -- I don't know, I just feel marijuana is just one of those [SIGH] --
L:  Well, what I started to say is --
R:  -- you've got studies that people say that it doesn't do anything, you've got studies that people say it does.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  The government could make a lot of money off of it. [NOISE]
L:  You got it.
R:  They -- and -- and you know what, they're how many billions of dollars in deficit --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and that they could tax that stuff [NOISE] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and they could stop th- the drug, you know, guys that are making millions off of it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stop the people that are afraid of 'em, and they're killing people because of the drugs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or at least because of marijuana, you know.  There's other --
L:  Well, see out here in the state of California --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- marijuana is legal for medical medicinal purposes --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- okay, and I totally believe in that.  
R:  Right.
L:  And I totally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- believe in that we should legal- legalize it and make --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it pay high taxes like, you know, cigarettes and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, the thing is that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we have the US Government out here, we have certain laws that allow people here in the state to grow medical mar- marijuana --
R:  Right, yeah, I've seen --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- yeah, I've seen it on the news and stuff.
L:  And the gover- -- the Bush administration will go after those people rather than -- I mean, they're doing it totally legal according to the state of California --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they go after those people rather than spending it --
R:  Going after the drug people and --
L:  Yeah, I mean, this is the --
R:  -- that are doing it illegal.
L:  -- that are doing illegal, you know.
R:  Yeah, see that --
L:  And --
R:  -- that I don't agree with, and that's where it comes into that, you know, you've got somebody that may have cancer with the drugs testing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that is taking the marijuana.  Yes, they probably have a prescription from a doctor, stating --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're legal to have it.  They're legal to have it in their system [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it could set off other red flags in the drug screen process to --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- that could get 'em fired.
L:  That's right.  And that's why I said, you know, there's things like marijuana and marijuana's -- also known that if you eat a lot of poppy seeds --
R:  Oh, yeah.  People say that it's not true, and I was watching a study on it, or, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one of those urban myth legend thingy shows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they --
L:  No, it's -- no, I've seen Doctor Dean Liddell tell that one, so --
R:  Ri- --
L:  -- he's no urban myth, if you know what I mean.
R:  Right, he -- they did an urban myth study on it, and the doctor that they -- you know, scientist or whoever they had test it, stated clearly that if you eat enough poppy seeds [NOISE] that it could [MN] mess with the test. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know what [MN], I'm -- granted I don't go around eating poppy seeds, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's people out there that do, that are actually just, like, eating them by the handfuls. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I mean, California, we're health conscious out here, you know, sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some segments are a little too, but anyhow.  You know, poppy seed muffins out here are very normal.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  -- they're -- they're something that, you know, we have all the time --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, that's why I say it -- I think that there have to be degrees --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of this flat, everyone gets tested --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's none of their goddamn business of what else is in my system, it's how does it affect the job that I'm doing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  Am I putting someone in harm's -- danger?
R:  Right.  If you're in an office and sitting there doing nothing except talking on the phone or messing with the computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't -- I don't know if it necessarily feel that you should be tested.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, yes, if the company thinks that you may be on heroin or you've got a major problem, and --
L:  Right --
R:  -- it's affecting your work --
L:  -- I mean if they -- if they have what we call -- what I would say just cause --
R:  Right, if it- it's affecting your work, then I could see maybe doing a drug test and -- and -- and get -- trying to get 'em help and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they don't do the help, then I can understand firing 'em.  But when it comes to [MN] -- yes, if there's a airplane guy out there smoking pot or, you know, doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think I'd wanna know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause he --
L:  I mean, that -- that's --
R:  -- has -- he has a couple hundred people's lives in his hand.
L:  Right.  And it's not just him.
R:  Right.
L:  A- and -- and that's -- that's what I consider to be just cause.
R:  Right.  It's like --
L:  You know.
R:  -- I drove -- I drove a school bus for a living for a while --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I had seventy kids and -- you know, lives in my hand in the mornings and in the afternoons.  And I agreed to having, uh, you know, like, school bus people tested --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it -- I will admit, marijuana can deter your, you know, visual impairment, maybe not your complete thinking, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so even marijuana, in that case, would not, in my opinion, wouldn't be [SIGH] right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But if I'm just sitting behind a --
