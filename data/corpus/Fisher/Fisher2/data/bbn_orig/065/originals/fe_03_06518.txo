R:  Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Hi.  My name is Jackie, I'm in New York.  Where are you from?
R:  My name is, uh, Jeff.  I'm uh, I live near Philadelphia.  
L:  Oh, okay.  You're not too far. 
R:  Not too far, no.
L:  Yes.  So do you know today's topic?
R:  Uh, yes.  Uh, about drug testing at work.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, uh, how do you feel about that?
R:  Well, um, I am okay with uh drug testing at work, uh, for certain jobs where safety or stealing or uh other uh factors may be in issue.  Uh, I think overall, though, it's probably not something that should be done too often, uh, if those factors are not involved.
L:  Right.  I agree.  I think if you work in a setting that you deal with, like, valuable things -- like, I used to work in a jewellery industry and I had, like, direct access to, like, all these fine goods and so a person that was, say, on crack or cocaine, something that's very addictive and they have to have it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- versus maybe a drink after work, that you know, you say, "Well, if I can't get one, that's okay", I would think in those aspects, yes, I -- I agree.  But I do think it invades the privacy some time, because like, I remember at one company I was working for, um, they had random testing.  Like, all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky they gave you, like, a random test.
R:  Right.
L:  And a lot of people, even though -- to me, I don't know, you know, what the look is, but they didn't seem like, you know, they did indulge, but they were reluctant to do it because they felt it was an invasion of privacy, like, versus a person that smokes pot for instance.  Um, they don't classify that as heavy.
R:  Right.
L:  They even trying to make it legal.  They had some more marches up here in New York, trying to make it legalized for the AIDS and cancer patients, so people that -- in that category, they're highly against it because they say that it's not addictive, it's like cigarettes and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- drinking a beer.  But then it's the controversy with the, um, you know, they have all this hard stuff out now so it -- it's really hard, but I -- I -- I agree, that it should be done for any facility that has valuables.  That I can --
R:  Valuables, also security.  You don't want security guards or uh -- I work in the uh, in the defense industry and you don't want people who, you know, have -- can be easily bribed or -- or people in those sorts of situations, um, to have uh -- be able to be drug tested.  Uh --
L:  That's right. 
R:  Wha- uh, what's that?
L:  I said I agree.
R:  Uh, it is an invasion of privacy.  The only question I would have is that whether there should be a law against it, uh, one could -- if I owned a company, I would not do it, except for the cases we mentioned, but one could say that uh the government uh shouldn't pass a law saying that you can't drug test because, you know, uh, the government cannot invade privacy, but the --  you know, what are the limitations against, a private company doing that?  As long as the -- you know, I could make an argument that the person who signs up for the job, as long as they know about this when they sign up for it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, that's the choice they make, you know?  "Well, if I -- if I'm not comfortable with the drug testing, I don't -- I just don't sign up for the job" or something like that.  So I might go that route, I might be persuaded to allow drug testing on those grounds, just because it's the right of the employee or the employer to do -- you know, to set the ground rules.  Um, just because an invasion of privacy, uh, might have different uh standards when the gov- the government versus the private uh -- the private sector might have different standards, but generally I -- I'm not comfortable even with uh a private company uh invading privacy, especially when it's not necessary.
L:  Yeah.  That much I agree with.  It -- there's a lot of companies, um [MN] here in New York, um, that um test the drug free and I'm like, what does that have to do with anything?  You know?  Um, Cable, Time Warner --
R:  Yes?
L:  -- for instance, um, they ran an ad and um you know, they -- I don't know what they were hiring for, but uh, unless you were a driver or something like that, but if you answer it for customer service and you're toasted[?], I mean, I don't see what the -- the -- the great damage will be done, you know, unless it's gotta be a person that maybe every time he gets toasted, he won't come to work or maybe he's probably -- because he may steal pocketbooks out the company.  Who knows where they coming from?  I think it's an invasion of privacy because a lot of these jobs now -- okay, like, I went on an interview not too long ago and -- and they -- they were asking all kinds of questions on the application and I --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And I -- they wanted to know if you would --
R:  What kind of questions were they asking?
L:  They were asking if you were gay, um, do you have anything against this and that, and I'm like, those things in the ELC and those handbooks --
R:  Both those were ille- -- 
L:  -- those are against the law.
R:  Yes.
L:  This company called Celebrity something -- Celebrity Century, it was a non profit organization and um it was in the Christianity um spiritual religions type of job I guess, I'm not sure, but I seen, like, a lot of little things around that had to do with, you know --
R:  Well, they may be exempt because they are a religious or non profit organization. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  If it's due to, like, fundamental beliefs they have.  Like, if you were, say um, working for a Jewish organization, you know, and they might want to ask you if you're a neo nazi, you know, even though they don't really have a right to know --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- normally what you believe, but because they're a non profit organization or a -- a religious organization, well, don't -- you know, they might -- they have a right to hire people that uh agree with their religious beliefs or, you know, or people who don't agree with their religious beliefs, they uh have a right to not hire.  But they're kind of a special category.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Um --
L:  What about banks?  How do you feel about banks?  I mean, banks, that's like the back office, not so much the banks that deal with the tellers.  But banks, um, offer support.  Like, I worked at Procurement once, in purchasing, which we -- the only thing we did, we was in charge of um making sure, like, say if you were hired in our company and you was executive, um, and you needed, like your own office and you said, "Well, I like this type of chair because I travel a lot and my back problems", we -- so we were in charge of making sure that you were accommodated on certain equipment in your office, and you know, you wanted a laptop versus a big computer, okay, what about people like that?  Do you feel that they should, um, also go on a drug testing like that?
R:  Well, if you um -- if you work at a bank and you have a lot -- you're in charge of a lot of money or you could steal a lot of money, I could -- uh, I would be okay with those people being uh -- um, drug tested, because that's the same thing as, uh, being responsible for goods and services that are very expensive, or jewellery.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're dealing with people's money, um, or other people's money.  I -- I would be okay.  If -- if they -- if the -- it would be easy for them to, uh, steal money, uh, I would be okay with drug testing in those circumstances.
L:  Oh, okay.  What about in like --
R:  Uh, it depends what job in the bank or -- I -- and I would have to know more about how, if they would have access or the opportunity to steal.
L:  Okay.  Let's -- like I say, going forward, what about um Time Warner Cable?  The customer service reps?  I mean, they have positions advertised for doing customer service and they wanted to drug test for that position.
R:  I probably wouldn't -- yeah, I don't think drug testing would be appropriate --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- in those circumstances.  Because I mean, customer service doesn't really -- you -- I mean, if it's generally just talking with people on the phone or setting up appointments, there's not really an opportunity, um, for uh testing there, that -- testing really wouldn't avail you anything.  Um, now um, ye- yeah.  So I don't -- I don't think, uh, drug testing now -- I -- as you may know, like alcohol is a lot worse for uh companies for -- or people who abuse alcohol, which is legal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, causes much more of a drain in productivity than drugs ever do. 
L:  Yes, I agree.
R:  So it's kind of interesting that uh companies are more concerned about doing the drug testing than -- well, in -- because alcohol's legal, there's really nothing they can do about that.  
L:  Right. 
R:  So I think there are -- they spend too much time worrying about drug testing.  What you can do is that people who -- if you take -- if you discipline or put on probation employees who are having problems on the job, you're probably -- a lot of those might be because they're on drugs so you can come at -- at the -- the general problem they have, whether it's stealing or otherwise, without doing the testing, because you can, "Okay, this person has a problem so we have identified the person and we're gonna try to help the person, take care of the person" without having to resort to drug testing.  
L:  I work in advertising and that was, like, my last real job before they relocated.  They moved, 'cause you know, the economy, you know --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- tight --
R:  It's a little slow, yeah.
R:  And [MN] and this was about -- let me see, I would say roughly about maybe five, six months ago, I haven't been in the industry, I just been doing like temp here and there, and um, my boss at that time, she fired a girl that she had just hired, uh, because she said she looked -- she was stoned.  Her eyes were always glassy.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay? And um --
R:  Did she fire her because of her performance or because she looked --
L:  Because she looked -- she said because her eyes were glassy every day when she came in.  
R:  Oh well, you can um -- I -- that, I think --
L:  And this is advertising.  I mean, we -- the only valuable thing we had around there, um, as far as I was concerned was um -- you know, we had a lot of, um, software, hardware and um basically that's it, and um the girl used to work for the airlines, so it's like she lost her job because, you know, with the -- the World Trade Centre?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay, so it was cut back from that, so she lost her job, so those people, a lot of them came into advertising depending what sector they was in, in the airline industry and my boss, she fired the girl.  I said, "What happened to the new girl?" and she said, "Oh, I let her go".  She said, "Every day, she comes in here with glassy eyes.  I'm not having that in this office".  And --
R:  Well, I don't think -- uh, I'm -- I've been trying to remember the training I had at work, because --
