L:  Hi, my name is Jackie.
R:  Hey, how's it going?  Kane here. [NOISE] 
L:  Good, how about you?  Hey.
R:  Yeah, so are you from LA?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right on.  This is the first -- usually I talk with guys, you know, I did- -- I didn't even know, I thought it was always supposed to be you're [SIGH] [NOISE] talking with other guys or something, but it's cool. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  What part of ah, LA?
L:  Um, like West LA, Brentwood.
R:  Oh, right on.
L:  What about you?
R:  Are you in like, school or something?
L:  No, I'm -- well, I am in school but, you know, like not right now, so, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean like -- like do you go to college or something, or?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right on.
L:  Yeah.  How about you?
R:  Ah, I graduated like two years ago.
L:  Oh, cool. [NOISE]
R:  Yup. [NOISE] 
L:  All right, so um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- about divorce then --
R:  But as for the d- -- the whole divorce thing, [NOISE] yeah I -- I think ah, in a lot of ways, marriage has become a joke in the country, just -- I mean, the fact that people can get divorces on a whim --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just think it's wr- -- in a lot of ways it's cheapened marriage, you know, it's like --
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  -- you can get on TV and propose and, you know, get married in front of America and 
L:  Yeah exactly, so 
R:  I mean, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I still wanna married, but it's like so many people just, I dunno, they get married, you know, after knowing each other for a week or two and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but 
L:  Yeah, I know, like I think a lot of it also, is like, celebrities have like, three marriages and like, nobody cares and everyone thinks that's fine, so, I guess a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of it has to do like what you said with like the TV thing, like it's just a big joke and nobody really treats it seriously.
R:  Well, it's l- -- it's like nobody  I mean there's a new phrase now, that's -- it's called starter marriage --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, it's like people to -- it's almost like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- almost like a -- a -- you can -- like breaking up or something, it's like, they don't take the vows seriously.  It's like, for better or for worse; most people [SIGH] nowadays, when it gets to the for worse part, just say, "Oh, divorce time". [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And I think people get this unrealistic notion that as soon as you get married it's gonna be happily ever after. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But it's not --
L:  But --
R:  -- that way. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I think like the worst part --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of like the whole divorce thing is like, kids are affected, 'cause my parents are married but like I have a lot of friends who like, their parents are divorced and so it messes up the kids too.  Like people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't even think that it affects their children, but it does. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, it's like a lot of --
R:  No one told me.
L:  -- [inaudible] with it.  Yeah, and I guess that that thing about um, like affecting my behavior, I don't know if it really does that much, just 'cause I'm not so much, like at that age yet, like I'm only sixteen so.
R:  You're only sixteen?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Damn.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  So you're still in highschool, huh?
L:  No, I'm actually just like in a special program and I'm sixteen in college, like my first year.
R:  Yeah, you sound really mature for sixteen.
L:  [LAUGH] Thanks. [NOISE] 
R:  I mean that's pretty impressive.  I've [SIGH] -- I was seeing -- I'm seeing this girl --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and she's freaking nineteen.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you're ten times more mature then she is. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Where do you live around?
R:  I live ah, over by Universal Studios.
L:  Oh, right on.  That's cool.
R:  North Hollywood.
L:  Oh yeah, I have like a lot of friends there.
R:  Oh, right on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you have any ah, siblings?
L:  Yeah, I have a -- an older brother, a younger brother and a little sister, so.
R:  Damn.  Big family.
L:  Yeah.  Huh?
R:  Big family.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty big.
R:  Um, where are you gonna go to college?
L:  Um, well right now I'm at Casta LA, but like I'm planning to go to like the East Coast probably, so --
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  -- that's my goal.  Yeah.
R:  Are you just calling this to get the dough?
L:  Yeah.  Pretty much.
R:  How many calls have you made so far?
L:  This is my first one, like I've called them, or I -- I've -- I signed up online like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a few weeks ago, went back a week or so and like, this is the first time I got called, so.
R:  Yeah, this is my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fourth one.
L:  Oh, cool, you -- you getting called a lot for that, that's cool.
R:  I [inaudible] -- they just keep paying me [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, I'm sure they do.
R:  -- that's all I know.  'Cause they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- said like, you get three calls.  I've already done three so it's like -- and they're still calling me --
L:  Yeah, I believe --
R:  -- so 
L:  -- there's a system[?] that you can get more.  So I guess like, you know, you have a really special voice they want, so.
R:  Oh, they c- -- they can get -- you can get more than three?
L:  I think so.  I don't remember what it was, but I think --
R:  But they'll still --
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  -- pay you, right?
L:  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
R:  Sweet.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so now it's up to forty bucks, that's not bad for just talking [LAUGH] on the phone you know?
L:  I know.  Yeah, like my mom showed me this.  I was like "Yeah, I really don't mind making ten bucks just for talking on the phone" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's nothing.  It's not that --
R:  Yeah you -- yeah you -- you sound really articulate for sixteen.
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you. [LAUGH]
R:  Like most sixteen year old girl -- girls are just like, "Well, like, oh my god, is Britney gonna play tonight?" you know, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know how it is.
L:  Yeah I do.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah that's like, why I left highschool too, I just 
R:  It's like refreshing, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] It all --
R:  Um, like the -- like the nineteen year old, she is so flaky, l- like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the age group where it's like they're oblivious to how they affect others, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like all about the -- you know, their entertainment and you know, just having a fun time and -- and that -- you know, if they make plans and then just skip out it's no big deal, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah that's like everywhere today too, like I dunno, it's not just like, what you said, like, with dating and like marriage, it's like everything, and I think everything kind of has been made into a joke, and like, nobody has to take anything seriously.
R:  Oh yeah, I mean, in the -- I mean that's what sucks for me, is you could -- like -- I dunno, I take marriage really seriously and then it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, is it -- it still it just like cheapens it for -- for more -- [MN] -- you know, my generation.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah so you're like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- twenty or so, or how old are you?
R:  I'm an old fart, I'm twenty five.
L:  Oh, twenty five, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm actually gonna be twenty six on Tuesday. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, happy birthday. [NOISE]
R:  Thanks.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, so that's cool, I mean, I guess you're even closer to that age, too, where you're gonna like, get married a lot sooner than I am, so 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would like to get married, but I'm also not gonna ru- rush into it like a lot of people I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, marriage isn't what keeps two people toget- together, it's just a piece of paper, you know --
L:  Yeah I know.
R:  -- you know it's more than that, it's just [MN] c- -- basically trust and, you know, communication.  If you don't have that, then [NOISE] you don't have much. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I completely -- yeah, my parents got married when they were really young, and like, there's been a lot of times I thought they were gonna get a divorce, just [NOISE] 'cause like, if you're so young, like, you don't know what you're doing and you just like --
R:  Oh yeah, my parents did the same way too, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] I think the only reason they're still together is like, [SIGH] back in the day, divorces were like, looked down upon more; nowadays it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, "Oh, big deal" you know?
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Yeah, it's definitely 
R:  But then my mom got married when she was nineteen --
L:  Yeah, my mom was twenty.
R:  -- they're like, and they're like almost -- my dad's turning sixty now, so it's like, they've been married forever.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  Yeah it's good my g- -- I guess my parents have been married like, eighteen years or like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nineteen or yeah, or something, so [NOISE] they've been married for a while too, they're still young. [PAUSE] [NOISE]
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah, I dunno.
R:  So where's -- are you -- like any second now too, we'll get cut off, it's kinda funny, 'cause you -- you could be talking to somebody, like having a really good conversation and then they're like, "Time is over" you know --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then it goes [MN] and you know it's like [LAUGH] you don't even have a chance -- you don't get to, you know, say, "Bye" to the person, you know.
L:  That's weird.  Yeah, I thought they'd tell you like, "Okay, time's over, like, say goodbye" or something, I dunno.
R:  Well, they do do that but it's like, [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they do it and then they just cut you off, you don't even really have a chance.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  You can s- like --
L:  That's pretty lame.
R:  -- say like, one or two words and [SIGH] it's kinda [NOISE] --
L:  Hm.  [NOISE] Yeah I --
R:  'Cause yeah I like -- the last guy I talked to, he was really nice, so like, there's been some pretty cool people I've talked to on here. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I mean when I was like reading the thing about it, and it said like, "Men -- men -- men" and, "We only want males" or something, so I was like, "Oh I don't know if this is gonna work" but --
R:  Yeah that's why like I -- when it said, "Oh, you'll get a dollar for each person you refer" and it said, "Males" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's why I thought like, "Oh, it's all guys".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like my -- the th- -- the three I talked to were guys, so it's like -- but the person who referred me was a girl, so I was like, that's kinda weird. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah like --
