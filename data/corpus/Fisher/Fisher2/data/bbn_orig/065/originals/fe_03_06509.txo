R:  [NOISE] Roslyn Jean.
L:  Uh, Laura Peterson.
R:  [NOISE] No, I don't think high profile criminal trials should be televised.
L:  Ah, I agree.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Because people don't get a fair trial, and they're tried on TV.
L:  Ah, yeah I think that's true, I --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- think it just becomes a media circus.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  Did you watch the OJ Simpson trial?
R:  [NOISE] Ah, yes I did and that was the biggest farce I ever seen in my life.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- watched a little bit of it, just out of curiosity, but um --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- yeah it just -- it seemed like a -- a circus.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] It was, it was a waste of the taxpayers' money --
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] needless -- needless to say, you know, [NOISE] [LAUGH] everybody tried him before the -- before trial even started.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] You know, so why waste the money?  
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] Let him go.  [NOISE] And it is the same with all the big people -- big name people on TV, they get --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [NOISE] trials and we the poor taxpayers wind up having to pay for it.
L:  True.
R:  [NOISE] Okay. 
L:  I think it's --
R:  [NOISE] And they still keep their money, even though they're saying -- oh well like OJ was saying, "Well, I'm broke" okay?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know how they think he's broke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know that um, we ended up paying for it and, um, it just seemed to go on and on and on --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and I think the, uh, TV stations were just making money off of it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  You know, let's push up the ratings here.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] And ah, why -- why give them that platform, you know?  And -- and even in the paper they still -- they still give 'em the platform on paper. 
L:  That's true.
R:  [NOISE] Why?  They're human like we are.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  And they killed somebody; okay so fine, they -- they killed them, or they paid to have 'em killed, whatever.  You -- you know you don't do it for the lowly people when they're sitting in the local jails, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- [NOISE] unless they killed more than one person, then the [inaudible] -- then [SIGH] -- then they'll put 'em in the paper.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [NOISE] You know, so 
L:  I don't quite understand why they do televise any of it --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  -- um, it's not really educational.  [MN]
R:  [NOISE] No.  'Cause, you know -- well, to me all it -- it would be saying is, "Okay, here you go, if you go out and kill ten people, we're gonna put you on TV". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Okay?  Or, "We're gonna splatter you across the newspapers".
L:  So it's a way to become famous.
R:  [NOISE] You know, fifteen minutes of fame --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] everybody knows you, you know, but now they're getting the way -- they're making them sign things where well, you can't get any movie deals off of this or [MN] --
L:  Oh, I di- -- I didn't know that, I didn't know they were doing that now.
R:  [NOISE] Oh yeah, and I -- I -- I -- to me, I think it's [MN] -- after the fact, it's too late if you killed ten people -- whether you get any money off of it, you're never really gonna use it 'cause you're gonna be dead or in jail.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hopefully.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Okay, 'cause somebody's either gonna kill you or you gonna be in jail for the next fifty years, and you wind up getting killed in jail.
L:  No, I don't know, now it seems like you get more jail time for doing drugs than you do for killing someone.
R:  [NOISE] Mm, that's true, that's true.  You know, because the lady -- the lady out in Texas only got what -- she got twenty years, she killed five +of -- five of them, and she got twenty years, [NOISE] you know?  And -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [NOISE] -- and I feel for her because I don't think she really was in her right mind [MN] 
L:  Oh, she's the one that killed her babies, right?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, 'cause no mother in her right mind could kill her own kids.
L:  No, no, but I don't think anybody who commits murder really is in their right mind, there's something wrong with them.
R:  [NOISE] No, not all of 'em, not all of 'em.
L:  You think some of them are sane?
R:  [NOISE] Some of them are sane.  Some of them I w- -- I would been through -- you know, where there's  well, I won't say th- they're sane, they just lose it, there are -- a mental lapse maybe.
L:  Yeah, not permanently insane, but maybe --
R:  [NOISE] No --
L:  -- temporarily insane.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] there -- there's a mental lapse there, or you know, like when you go in -- they go in with the robbery and, "Nobody moves or I'll shoot" and of course they're -- they're nervous --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] [LAUGH] and somebody moves and they start -- and -- and -- well somebody shoo- -- starts shooting and one person is shooting, then everybody starts shooting.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  It's just -- yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And of course the person -- you know, they get caught, they's the one that's gonna be charged with all the murders.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um, but they are -- [SIGH] you know -- they -- I -- I guess we are a society where we have to market everything, uh, we have to tell everything.  That's -- that's one of my theories, you know, we have to tell everybody everything we're doing.
L:  [MN] As far as putting ah, trials on TV, I know that, um, everybody's curious, everybody wants --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to know how the process works. [NOISE] Um, it is a form of entertainment, like reality television, but I don't think it serves justice.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Ah, entertainment? 
L:  I think people --
R:  [NOISE] Oh yeah, because, you know I guess --
L:  It's like sitcoms or soap operas.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, 'cause I have a sister in law that watches that kinda stuff.
L:  Court?
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Court TV?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, she watches all that crazy -- [SIGH] and she watches all the one with the crazy people like with the guy that -- [MN] what's his name?  The serial killers?
L:  Oh I haven't seen that one.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Oh well, she watches all of that it -- it -- it's on A and E I think, she watches all of that.
L:  Does she watch Judge Judy?  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh I think she watches -- yeah, I -- I -- personally I watch Judge Judy.  I -- I watch all of 'em, then I get found like, "Okay" and [MN] [LAUGH] -- you know because a lot of the judges don't act like Judge Judy. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  Wonder if his -- if these trials are really any different, just longer?  
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Well, you know, the lawyers have to get paid so, you know, we have to drag it out a while there, had to pay for the swimming pool or the new car --
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] [LAUGH] or the kids' education fund --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, so we gotta get our share out of this.  [MN]
L:  Well, that's a -- that's a point is, ah, what do the lawyers get out of televised trials?
R:  [NOISE] Mm, hey, free advertisement. 
L:  Uh-huh --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- for their profession, for their reputation.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, word of mouth.  "Hey, I saw you on TV and you did this" you know? And let's say --
L:  That's like if -- only if they do well though.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] [MN] Yeah that's true.  Hey, look at Johnny Cochrane, he's on a roll now.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [NOISE] M-kay.  He's on a roll, he gets a hundred thousand dollar -- he -- he commands a hundred thousand dollar fees and he's getting -- take the case if he wants to or if not, he don't have to.
L:  I don't think I would personally hire a lawyer though, that had been on TV.
R:  [NOISE] You know a high -- high profile lawyers [SIGH] probably would taint your case more, or I -- I don't wanna say taint -- what do I wanna say?  Um, [LIPSMACK] they would -- they -- I guess people would get attitudes or judgements before you even get in there.  You know, they could say, "Well, if you can afford a hundred thousand dollar lawyer, you're already guilty".
L:  Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Okay, even though you probably didn't even do anything wrong, just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, but, hey, you got a hundred thousand dollar lawyer to prove this, so hey, no, no, no, something in -- something here's not right.  Um, but you know, like I said they are -- ah -- we are um -- America is a marketable society; we want to market it, we want to tell everybody everything we're doing, [MN] you know, we want to put it on TV, we want to put it in print, billboards, everything, you know.  You look around and lawyers have gotten to where they, you know, they can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] advertise on TV now.
L:  By doing these trials?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [PAUSE] [NOISE] They advertise everything now, "Oh well if you go to trial, I'll be there for --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- [NOISE] you", you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- [NOISE] "We can get you off", you know, "Call us, this is our number, one eight hundred", you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's true.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Doctors don't do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] No, you know, anytime before you wanted a lawyer you always have to ask around, "Okay, like who's a good lawyer?"  But you know -- and I- I'm quite sure, you know, h- how people, you know, in ... they're in those circus -- I call 'em the media circuses --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] they get caught up in those media circuses, you know, they can afford the hundred thousand dollars lawyers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause I know um, I was watching the one show my son watches on TV, it's a cop's show, about the woman that had her husband killed, and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [NOISE] looked like she was gonna get away with it, but in the end it came out, you know, because she claimed her daughter did it but she didn't do it, the woman actually did have the man killed.  [LAUGH]
L:  This true -- truth or fiction?
R:  [NOISE] And she had a -- a high paid lawyer who got her off.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  This a true story or fiction?
R:  [NOISE] It was a fiction --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [NOISE] something on TV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] [MN] My s- -- my sons watch these crazy prison shows and ah, cops shows on TV.
L:  [LAUGH]
