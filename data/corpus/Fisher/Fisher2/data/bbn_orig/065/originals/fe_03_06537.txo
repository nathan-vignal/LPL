R:  Hello
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Peggy.
L:  Hi, I'm Kathy.  I'm in California.
R:  I'm in Alabama, [NOISE] way down south.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, so, drug testing, huh?  Hm.  Have you ever -- have you worked somewhere where they did that?
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  D- -- How do you feel about it?
L:  I have absolutely no problem with it.  If a comp- --
R:  I don't either.
L:  -- if a company wants to do pretty much anything legal and ethical --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, it's their company.  If somebody doesn't like it they don't have to work there.
R:  Well, my husband was -- used to be in the steel industry before it died and y- -- that's [MN] some of those people were on drugs that were hauling steel over your head and stuff [LAUGH] you know, you could be, uh, dead from, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if somebody was using drugs.  So, uh, well they tested them like that and he -- of course he never was against it either.  But I guess he was for it because there was several they found that didn't need to be there.
L:  Yeah.  No, I was -- my, um, my last full time job was, um, [LIPSMACK] a company that manufactured parts for airplanes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And those guys were -- I wasn't drug tested 'cause I was in the office.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the guys that worked on the, um, [LIPSMACK] out in the back making the parts; they were drug tested.
R:  Because they could hurt each other --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and themselves.
L:  Well, sure.  And they come in -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they could crash planes.
R:  Uh-oh.  Yeah.
L:  If, you know --
R:  Well, [LAUGH] yeah, if it's not right. 
L:  -- if -- [LAUGH] if they were, uh, you know, making --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the parts and the parts weren't up to spec because they were loaded and -- and, you know, doing who knows what, you know, kinda off a little bit.
R:  Oh, [MN] that's not good. 
L:  Um, I mean, it could bring down a plane.
R:  That's right, life and death.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, yeah.  So --
R:  Yeah, I don't know why there's been so much, you know, there's been a lot of news -- in the news about lately and stuff and I'm -- I don't why so many people are against it --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- unless they want to use drugs [LAUGH] at work or something.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  No.  I don't understand it just like I don't understand it at schools, you know, the kids are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "How dare you, you know, it's invading our privacy".  Well, I don't think so.  You're getting a free education.
R:  That's right.  
L:  You don't need -- 
R:  If they won't open those lockers with a dog that sniffs it then they go to it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- uh, yeah.  I don't -- I don't have a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- problem with that as a parent.
R:  I don't either.
L:  If -- if my child was using drugs and I didn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- know it I would want to know it.
R:  Oh, definitely, yeah.
L:  And -- and as a student I think I'd want to know if the person next to me was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing something that maybe I should be wary of so maybe I shouldn't be around --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that person --
R:  Well, no. 
L:  -- in case they get in trouble. 
R:  Yeah.  To me --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's just really a safety thing all the way round.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I mean, I sorta wish they did it more places [LAUGH] than just --
L:  So --
R:  -- on the job and at school.  [LAUGH] And of course they do -- do a lot of times in places where they're hiring people but, you know, I don't know if they -- if they keep it up ongoing or not.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't know --
R:  Because, I mean, it's pretty accurate too.  I mean, there's not too many false positives I don't think out there.
L:  I think unless you eat some, like, [MN] something with poppy seed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's pretty much the only thing that I've heard where --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, if --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [NOISE] --
R:  You know, that was on a Seinfeld episode not [LAUGH] long ago.  Did you s- -- do you ever watch the old ones --
L:  Um, not --
R:  -- Se- Seinfeld?  
L:  -- not recently, no.  --
R:  Yeah.  Elaine kept testing positive at work and it was because she was stopping to get poppy seed buns every morning on her way to work.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, I mean, but it does really happened too in -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in rea- -- in real life.   Mm.
L:  Yeah.  But I guess as long as they take something like that into consideration.
R:  Yeah, well, yeah, and they gotta, you know, retest and if you're on some type of prescription drugs you got the prescription and, uh, you know, all that would be taken into consideration I'm sure.  [PAUSE] But they probably weeded out some people that didn't need to be there.  On a lot of times in different work sites.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't know.  I don't know how people can think that that's against their rights.  If -- if --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I mean, I don't -- personally I don't have a big problem with drugs.  I mean, I don't use them but I don't --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- you know, I think that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a personal right.  But I also think that if you choose to do that you shouldn't be doing it around work.
R:  Well, not employ- -- I mean, it's just plainly[?] illegal.  You know, if -- if marijuana was legalized then they probably wouldn't have a right to check people at work for it, although they shouldn't be at work dong it.  But, I mean, every single thing that they're taking or using is flat[?] illegal now so ...
L:  And, well, I mean, even -- but some of the things like alcohol, they do test where I was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- working before, they did test for that too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was a safety issue.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and that's the same with, like, um, truck drivers and bus drivers.
R:  So on and -- and --
L:  They -- they do test -- 
R:  -- you know, pa- -- pilots have been in the news lately for being drunk.
L:  Right.  They do test --
R:  And that's dangerous.
L:  -- them too.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE] 
L:  But I think pretty much --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- all of it -- it's, you know, it's for the safety and concern of other people if you -- if you know, if you chose to do something at home --
R:  Mm, Yeah.  That's the way I feel --
L:  -- a- as long -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, just don't bring it into work where it's going to be bothering --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- other people.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and if people can't do without it long enough to go to work, they've got a problem anyway.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, sure they do.
R:  So, they don't need to be, particularly have that job then there's probably a lot of other people that just might need it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And that won't be spending or whatever that money on the drugs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I don't know if it's, uh, you know, I just don't think it's going to every really be controlled in this country no matter how many people we try to -- add those -- the drug agents and stuff that are along the c- -- like, down, like, between here and Mexico and stuff.  I didn't -- no matter wh- -- and how many pla- -- and it's really -- another thing that we -- it's a real big problem around here; It's these homemade methamphetamine labs.  They h- -- they arrest people nearly every day that have -- that are -- are making that stuff in their homes and selling it.  And there's been so many people that's died because they're using dangerous things making it and they blow themself up and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Thee was something I just, like --
R:  But there's a lot of 'em in this area.
L:  Yeah.  I think there's not too many, like, right around here -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because this is really urban.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  But not too far.  I mean, I -- I -- and I -- from what I --
R:  Yeah, they're mostly out in the country.
L:  -- understand you can smell it.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I understand that you can smell, you know, whenever they're doing, whatever they're doing.  So, it's more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, usually more open.  But I know there were a couple of, uh, explosions really just recently --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with something like that.  So, yeah ...
R:  I know, uh, and, I mean, it's just so stupid.  But apparently there's -- what you need to do, it's available just anywhere.  And I guess it must sell for a [inaudible] I don't, you know, I don't really know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- know much about it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm mhm.  But it's another -- every time I pick up the paper somebody around this area or the next county, [PAUSE] they've found another one, [LAUGH] you know, sometimes --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- they go there for something else and I guess like you said; I guess they smell it or neighbors report it or something.  But, you know, that's banned.  Course I, uh, you know, it's just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I guess doesn't matter how hard they try to regulate stuff, there's gonna always be somebody doing [LAUGH] something illegal --
L:  Well, it seems like --
R:  -- to -- to get -- to change how they feel.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seems like, I mean, you know, what -- whatever it takes to make 'em, you know, extra money or, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever, a lot of money. 
R:  Easy -- it looks like easy money I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] been easy and that they'll never work out in the long run I don't think.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  No, I don't think so either.  And I don't know how they can live with themselves.
R:  Oh, I know that, um, I think -- and then there's been a whole lot of problem round here with that OxyContin; that prescription pain medication.  Have you all had a -- any problems with that?
L:  I [MN] I'm -- I've --
R:  We've had several young people here just in this small county, and we don't have a very big population, that died from it.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  They s- -- well fo- -- it's -- it's a long acting, like, pain medication for like really -- people who have a really bad chronic pain.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they take like one -- I think it's maybe two or three times a day they take it.  And the kids apparently --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have decided to put it in water and inject it.  It's killing 'em. 
L:  Well, really?
R:  -- It was killing 'em.  Oh, course --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- almost anything that's -- that's [LAUGH] not sterile and you mix up and inject, I guess it could kill you but, um, there's ses- several doctors have lost their license over prescribing it and stuff.  But I don't, you know, I'd -- I doubt that's going to get to [LAUGH] the root of that whole problem either.
L:  Yeah.  No.  Probably 
R:  If it's not one -- 
L:  Probably -- 
R:  -- w- -- one -- 
L:  -- not if -- if you've got people that are willing to stick a needle in their arm --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for any reason --
R:  Oh, I know it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, I just can't see that one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know how they get over that one the first, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe after the first dose of heroin it's [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] I don't know how they do it the first time really.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But ...
L:  No.  I don't -- I don't know.  I mean, it's bad enough when you're in the hospital and someone's doing it for, you know, a valid reason.
R:  Yeah.  I know it.  Yeah.  But [MN] -- 
L:  I don't know, I guess maybe I'm glad I'm a coward.
R:  [LAUGH] Sometimes I --
L:  And I'm trying to raise my children to be cowards too.
R:  -- to be that way, I know.  I know it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what -- I've tried my best t- t- -- my sons are grown now; my youngest is twenty.  But if somebody else wants to rot away let 'em have it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, you don't have to be manly and jump in the way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, there -- there's times to back down and still feel good about yourself.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And lately --
R:  Where's -- but that 
L:  -- it seems like more and more.
R:  -- road rage stuff, yeah.  That just, to me I just say, " [several inaudible words] I don't care".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'll get there eventually.  [LAUGH] But, you know, it's a hard thing for males to do I think.  [LAUGH] Mm, but that, yeah, we've -- that's [several inaudible words] education service in Birmingham, which is a bigger city here in Alabama, uh, th- this past year was a woma- -- she killed another one and -- [LAUGH] and I think she maybe got off with about ten or fifteen years for manslaughter.  But still, I mean, she killed -- she murdered.  She had -- had a gun handy when the incident happened.
L:  Huh.
R:  It's -- it's been a lot of those around too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we've --
R:  Do y- -- 
L:  -- got big, you know, the LA freeways --
R:  So, y- you live in a big -- in the big part of California in LA?
L:  Well, I'm am in Southern California, uh, and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's, like, I'm not downtown LA but I'm in a --
R:  Not that far.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] I'm in a big city.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] There are lots of people and freeways and all that kind of stuff and --
R:  Yeah.  Ooh.
L:  -- people are looney.
R:  Are they?  Yeah.  'Cause I just live in the country.  [LAUGH] They don't --
