R:  [NOISE] Hello, this is Melissa.
L:  Hi, this is Tina.
R:  Hi, Tina.  Um, I guess we should just go straight into it, huh?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  I guess so.  It's -- it is becoming a prevalent thing that they're doing now, with the drug testing and stuff.  I work in pharmacy, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm aware -- [LAUGH].  Um, I don't see --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I feel that it should probably be a thing that they do.  I don't know, it's -- you know, it's hard to have -- depend on somebody to be able to do things whenever they're on, kinda anything.  I don't [NOISE] --
R:  Hello?  Tina?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you there [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Well, um, I feel they should just do it when they suspect something, you know, not just do it as a -- a matter of course, you know, for hiring somebody, or you know.  If the person, I mean, if you've passed the interview process and everything, I don't see why [MN] they should just go ahead and arbitrarily have you drug tested.  You know, unless they have -- unless you're exhibiting some kind of signs of using, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or unless you're -- like in your case, you're working in pharmaceuticals.  Unless th- the -- the,  um, the workplace has easy access to that kind of stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  
L:  That's true too.
R:  I mean, if you're no way in contact with drugs, if you're not operating heavy machinery, if you're just pushing papers or something like that, you know, I really don't see the need for it.  You know what I mean?
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  If you're not going to be operating or -- or dealing with highly confidential stuff.  But, like you said, everybody's doing it now, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there are so many drugs out there now.  People are pres- -- on prescription drugs and everything can show up, and, you know, they would think that these people are abusing.  So, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they have ways of screening all that out of some.  I mean, if -- if they're, you know [NOISE] [inaudible] or whatever, but I mean, I -- I do -- I don't know.  I don't have a problem with it [LAUGH].  I don't use them myself, so I -- I guess [inaudible] [NOISE].
R:  Well, yeah.  I've been -- I've been done a couple of times so -- and, you know, [SIGH] I've never used [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But [MN] --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  They're just becoming more strict with everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that's just one of the stuff that they're doing now.
L:  Yeah, I guess that --
R:  And it's gonna get worse.
L:  It's even as bad as, um, I don't -- I don't smoke either, but they're pushing on the smokers, like, [LAUGH] it's gonna become against the law to do that pretty soon.
R:  Yeah, you gotta go outside the building, in a particular spot to smoke --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- you can't smoke inside any more, they got you guys designated in a little area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can't smoke in public places --
L:  I know.
R:  -- in a grocery stores or anything like that, so yeah, mhm. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, it's gonna become against the law.  So, I guess, it's kind of coming -- I don't know, maybe it is [LAUGH] -- it's getting to be a problem, I don't know.
R:  Mm.
L:  Ah, they're -- they are enforcing a lot more restrictions, I guess.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Drug testing -- so, where are you from, Tina?
L:  Uh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  I'm calling from Georgia. 
L:  Oh.  
R:  So --
L:  Mhm.  They get all over the country [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they sure do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I missed a couple of them though.
L:  Yeah.  How long does --
R:  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I was like, "Okay, so what do we do now?" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly, like, we've both, like, shared our feelings on that.
R:  Yeah.  It's done, okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  Well, summer's started.  Has summer started for you?  Do you have kids?
L:  I -- yeah, but they're grown up.  
R:  Oh, okay, lucky you.
L:  I got -- yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, summer's  -- it's -- it's -- it's getting nice.
R:  Mm.
L:  We're still getting -- our weather isn't that great yet.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, we have beautiful weather right now.
L:  Hm.
R:  Especially this weekend.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is a good weekend for that.
R:  Oh yeah, uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, school finished on Friday for the kids, so, um, man, this is like the time when parents are dreading --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what do you -- what do you do with them for two months?
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, so ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I guess just gotta deal --
L:  Ha- have you --
R:  Huh?
L:  Yeah.  Have you -- have you done any of these studies before, these ...?
R:  I sure did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is your first time?
L:  No, I -- I did a couple of them.
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, but it -- yeah, it's like, I don't know, seems like [inaudible] after you're done talking about what you're supposed to talk about.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah, w- we -- we don't think that they need to do drug testing.  Okay, next question.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We don't need ten minutes to discuss this here.
L:  No, we don't really.
R:  I think one of them that I -- that they called, they had th- the discussion was, um, [LIPSMACK] how do you feel about, what was it, um, if you would perjure yourself for a close --
L:  Really?
R:  -- friend or family member or something, something, something, and, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was like, "Oh, my god" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, dang, that was a tough one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that was the last one that I did [LIPSMACK].  If you would go -- if you know that, you know, that you know that they did something or whatever, would you perjure yourself?  I was like, "Okay" ...
L:  Yeah, that would be tough.
R:  Mm.
L:  I hope never to be faced with that kind of a thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I have a -- I have a real big problem with telling lies to --
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's what I would of said.  I was like, "Oh, gosh, I would -- you know, but you know --"
L:  Yeah, you can't [LAUGH] --
R:  You can't really say that, because you -- you haven't got in that situation, and you don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, what's going on, if it's to save their life, you know.  
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I'm like, "Jeeze", because sometimes, you know, the -- the justice system just looks in black and white.  They don't look in the -- the gray area of it.  Okay, if I tell you this --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you gonna let this out and next thing you know, I'm supposed to have -- end up dead, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They just want what they want, and they don't look at the big picture sometimes, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that was a tough one.
L:  Hm.
R:  [SIGH] I can't even remember what the first one was about though, the first one that I did for them. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  It's been interesting [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN] [inaudible]
R:  -- just talking to somebody el- -- you know, off the wall here.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You don't know [LAUGH].  It's kind of strange.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But it's kind of nice, too.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Huh. [PAUSE] [MN]
R:  I was just --
L:  You've gotta fill up that ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I was washing my dishes, but I had to run in here to catch the phone, so, I mean --
L:  Mhm.  I'm just getting ready to go to work; they just caught me.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, you can continue dressing I guess --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and fixing up and all of that stuff.
L:  Yeah.  I was just getting my shoes on, actually [SIGH].
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Getting like -- getting ready to walk out the door [MN].  I figure I can wait ten minutes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It's going so slow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Gosh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ten minutes ...
L:  Mhm [MN].
R:  So long. 
L:  So, do you have any --
R:  Hey people, we're done.  If I have any what?
L:  Do you have any plans for the summer with your children?
R:  Um, [NOISE] yeah, I intend to go back home for a while.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  And they have a camp, um, like -- it's like a -- a club, a -- a club, uh, boy scout thing.  Well, we call it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a patfire[?] club.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have a week long camp there, that one time, and, um, going back home, mean, um, the Virgin Islands --
L:  Oh.
R:  Go home for a -- a while on -- on vacation.
L:  Oh, that'll be nice.
R:  Yeah.  And, of course, they have the regular day camps that they go to, 'cause I refuse to leave 'em home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So I have to shell out some dough [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to deal with that.
L:  Yeah, but it's good, ah, because then they're not looking for trouble, you know [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, having easy access to computer twenty four seven, uh uh, not a good thing.  No, uh uh uh, no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But, um, I -- I mean, I do have parental control on it, so they can't get on the internet unless I log on [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But still, you know.  I don't want to be hearing anybody singing in my ear, "I'm bored, I'm bored --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- there's nothing to do", and then trying to get into mischief.  I come, uh, I come home and meet, uh, burn marks on my rug, or something, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Mhm.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was a kid once, I know how [SIGH], you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things can start out innocent, and then ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] But, and my birthday's next week, so I gotta try and figure out what to do with myself next week.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's been a while since I could do something really nice for myself, for my birthday, so --
