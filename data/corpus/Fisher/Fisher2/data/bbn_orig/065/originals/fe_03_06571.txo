L:  Hello?
R:  Hello [SIGH].
L:  Hi.  This is, uh, Debbie.
R:  Victoria.
L:  Hi, Victoria.  Um, so what do you think?  What do you think about family values?
R:  Um, I think [LIPSMACK], like, after all the terrorism and everything that it is, um, stronger now.  That's what I think.
L:  Yeah.  I think, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I don't know statistics.  I'm strong on family values and, um [LIPSMACK], on marriage.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's -- of the institution of marriage, I think it's very important.  I, um, I think that people who are, um, well, living together a long time it's just like they were married, and, um, they probably should get married.  And I think it affects their children --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and I think that, um, it affects, uh, how the kids are now.  Um, [MN] I --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- I believe that there is, um, a lot of problems with, um, children these days because of the break up of divorce.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Yeah.  Although I have a daughter and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I think it's good to instill family values into your children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, as far as marriage, divorce.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] I'm not married, so ...
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [NOISE] But --
L:  Were you ever married before?
R:  [NOISE] No.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  But you would try to have them say that that's important [NOISE]?
R:  Yeah, I would tell them -- I would pr- -- I would try and tell my daughter to g- get married before she has kids.
L:  Right, right.  
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I agree with you regarding that, um, that it's important.  When I -- when I grew up, um, hardly any parents got divorced --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  I -- I graduated, like, in eighty one, so, um [COUGH] -- the seventies, eighties --
R:  That's the year I was born.
L:  Mhm [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, so very rarely would you hear that.  And a lot of moms were home for the kids.  Now, I think, um, and I gu- -- and my ha- -- hand's out to you, I know it's probably very difficult raising a daughter, um, without, um, a husband around or --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- by yourself.  And, I mean, you can't be -- I -- I don't know how old your daughter is, but I assume that you have to work and sort of --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, she's two.
L:  -- you know.  And, um, you have a double burden, so, um --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [MN] I don't know.  I think, um -- I don't want to take up all the time, but, um, I have friends that are teachers and they see the effects far as in schools, on [inaudible] on children.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Um, they're torn up, they need counselling because of break ups, because of their parents breaking up and, um, [MN] and that so ...
R:  [NOISE] [MN] And it has an effect on like -- a l- l- -- how the children act, like in the schools.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And about their parents.
L:  Right [LIPSMACK].  Without, um, the male role --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- or a female role, vice versa, I'm not just, like --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- saying for men.  But, um, yeah it w- -- um, [LIPSMACK] I have seen statistics, um, I couldn't quote them 'cause I don't have them in front of me, but, um, of, um, people who, um -- marriages that are strong and, um --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- when the parents are involved -- and even single parents --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know, like, um, like a mom or dad who raises their kid but are with them --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and makes sure that they're doing fine in school, that the outcome's much better than, you know -- than left -- left out, so ...
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I think that, um, our children need guidelines and, um, even though I know when I was a kid I didn't want guidelines, but, um, that, um, guidelines are good because it, um, they're a guide.  You know, like, [MN] not to do drugs --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know, hang around with good people --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- um, uh -- I don't know.  So, what do you think?  I'm doing all the talking.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think that, um, [MN] like things have changed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] like, I think nowadays kids grow up faster --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] than when I was younger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] The clothing is much different --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- there's not w- -- wasn't clothes like that when I was younger.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Um ...
L:  [NOISE] Do you think a lot of it has to do with TV?
R:  Yeah, in a way.  
L:  Mhm.  Yeah --
R:  It is --
L:  -- the programs -- the programs --
R:  -- and the celebrities. [NOISE]
L:  -- are, I think --
R:  Like Britney Spears.
L:  [NOISE] R- -- oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  The way she dresses, and the kids --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just wanna be like that.  They take that as their -- being their role model.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So, that's --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think it's in, um, I agree.  I think that, um, that, um, as parents we have to shelter our kids in -- in that and be watchful to watch those type of programs, [SIGH] 'cause that's not really reality, in the, um --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- they try to make it reality and it ends up getting them in trouble.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.  
L:  Mhm [LIPSMACK].
R:  [NOISE] [MN] It- it's just the celebrities, TV, a combination of TV and just like we said before, just the parents not being there.  The parents are being outta the house --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] and leaving their kids in there.  That's how the kids end up partying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] they're into drugs or into something they're not supposed to be doing.  
L:  Right.  How old were you when you had your child?
R:  [NOISE] I was nineteen.
L:  Okay.  [MN] I, um, volunteer at the crisis pregnancy center [COUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- [MN] so we get a lot of, um, young girls, even quite younger than you --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- um, in there.  And we try to support them and help them [NOISE] [MN] for that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK] -- [SIGH] so you could come at it at a direction of p- possibly personally --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, um [NOISE] -- yeah, I just -- we re- recently, um, [LIPSMACK] just got a letter from a girl from seven years ago.  She was a eighteen year old with a child --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and she was homeless.  And we took her in and she lived with us for three months --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, [MN] we helped her get a job and we got an apartment for her --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and helped her, but unfortunately, um, she wanted to do her own thing.  So, I think she ended up, um, back on the streets.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  But we just recently -- this is really cool --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- just got a letter from her and, um, she lives in a different state.  And she was thanking us for all [NOISE] the things that we did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And at that time, she didn't realize it, and, um [NOISE] -- my d- -- th- -- so, they didn't realize at that time.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I was [MN] -- I was -- I was adopted when I was three --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and I just met my mom two weeks ago.  I just moved to Nevada.
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and I just met my mom two weeks ago.  
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I moved here from New York.
L:  Wow.
R:  So ...
L:  Put those back, I'm drying them out.  Don't touch 'em, put 'em back. [SIGH] So, how was that?
R:  It was fine.  Everything's going great.
L:  Good.
R:  You know, I didn't bring my daughter out here with me or anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I left her in New York, and I'm supposed to go back and get her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'm just focusing on school --
L:  Good.
R:  -- and trying to find a job out here.
L:  Good.  And, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all those things you believe in now [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- stand by them and just be there for your daughter and, um, and, um -- if you hit hard times try not to let her have hard times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that, you know, one thing I think you realize too is, um, there are people out there that can help you.  There are churches out there --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and, um [MN] [LIPSMACK], many organizations that are out there to, um, help young mothers.  [NOISE] Um, so they don't have to repeat the cycle and, um, to help you and encourage you and -- and that.  So ... [MN] well, that's great.  What was, um, what was some of the other questions?  It was, um [MN] --
R:  That was it.  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I remember that -- that one, the family values --
L:  But, um, yeah --
R:  That's the only one I remember.
L:  -- about family values.  Um, let me think of some other family values.  Of, um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think just being together.  I think that's a big thing, is, um, this day and age, everything's so fast paced --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and, um, your kids could be involved in soccer, baseball, everything is so fast paced that it's so easy to think you're doing all the right things for your family --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] but yet you forget about just spending time with 'em.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And your kids grow up so fast --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, you keep saying, like for instance, "Oh, I'll -- I'll play with you, I'll play with you", before you know it, like, they're grown up and [SIGH], um, so I think with family values, is spending time with them.  I think that would be a big one. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Um, I feel -- I still feel that, like, it -- every family should have like a family game night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or something.  'Cause like you said, everybody's doing all these different activities.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then, everybody should have at least, like, once or twice a week.
L:  Right [LIPSMACK].
R:  And I used -- we used to do it when we was little, like on Fridays.
L:  Right [LIPSMACK].  And not so much TV --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- or computer games --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- or whatever it might be, and, um, yeah, play the games.  Play outside, uh, with the kids.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think family values, of course I think would be church, that wo- -- that would be --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- like the number one is, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is -- is doing, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something from a church what could bring in morals and, um, values.  I think morals and values I think could go hand in hand.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it does. [SIGH] Church -- I used to go to church too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was a big thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Just to keep the faith.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, that was a big one, I think, for me.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  'Cause it kept me outta trouble, kept me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not for going -- not -- not saying not going outside.  I didn't like going outside anyway --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] but --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, definitely. [NOISE] I think that's -- that's important.  'Cause, um, there are so many churches around that have youth groups --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and then they keep the kids off the streets.  And also [NOISE], um, for their peers and that they offer [NOISE] alternatives to --
