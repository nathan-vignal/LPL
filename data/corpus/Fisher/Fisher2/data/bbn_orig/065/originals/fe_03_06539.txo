R:  Hi, my mane is Mary.
L:  Hi Mary, my name is Deborah.  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  How are you Deborah?
L:  Good thank you.
R:  I'm in New Jersey.  Where are you?
L:  Upstate New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You're probably the closest call I've had.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] Um, have you had many?
L:  Um, this is my fourth.
R:  Oh, okay.  This is my third.  
L:  So ...
R:  Okay, I guess the question of the day is how do I feel about drug testing.
L:  Drug testing, yeah.
R:  Yeah, by companies.  Okay, uh, you know what?  Personally, I don't have a problem with it.
L:  I don't either.
R:  I think that if a company wants to hire you, they every right to know whether or not you're using illegal drugs.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, you know, I agree.  Um, I don't think most companies are going to do that unless there's s- some, you know, safety reason that they have to do that anyway.  I mean, if it's, uh, your safety or the safety or -- of the -- of other people or the safety of, you know, machines where you're working on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it just makes a lot of sense to me.  And I mean -- 
R:  Right.  I agree.
L:  -- far as I'm concerned you shouldn't be doing that anyway.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  If -- if drugs are illegal then --
L:  You know -- 
R:  -- you shouldn't be doing them.
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  And I agree.  Um, I know here, uh, we -- at Home Depot they hire -- when they hire they drug test, which --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- um, yeah.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah, cashiers, you name it; they're drug testing everybody.  And, uh, you know, some people, I mean, aren't cashiers; some people are cutting wood or whatever and using some of tho- -- dangerous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, equipment, which of course it would make sense.  But I had only heard of that recently and I thought it was a little odd.  But when you think about it, I mean, [MN] if you're using illegal drugs then, you know, you're -- you're -- you have a problem.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, it -- it does make a lot of sense because as you say, if somebody's cutting wood and they're using, um, some kind of a saw and they're on drugs, and then --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- something goes wrong and they hurt either themselves or somebody else, who's going to get sued?  Everybody including Home Depot, whether it's their fault or not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I mean, they're just pretty much trying to guard themselves against that happening.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you -- you can't blame 'em.  It's cheaper for them to drug test their employees --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- than to have some kind of law suit or somebody die or --
R:  I agree.  I -- 
L:  so ...
R:  -- I -- I agree.  I don't think it's -- it's much of a problem.  Um, I know I take several medications and, I'm t- -- I'm just concerned, like, at this point I'm looking for a new job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm concerned because I know that if I go for a job, if they do require drug testing, that I'll have to disclose the drugs that I'm on in order to not be, you know, i- -- ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, not included for the job.  But then I also wonder if I tell them what drugs I'm on, will that preclude me from getting the job.
L:  Well, I know that --
R:  You know.
L:  -- it's not supposed to.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I don't really know what happens to those results or, you know, I think [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I think all they can report -- i- if they do, like, a five panel drug screen, I think all they can report is those five panels.  And if you pa- -- if you test negative --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for those five things, you know, and, a- -- um, a- -- barbiturates, amphetamines, pot and there's two others.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I think --
R:  Yeah, I don't know a lot about it.
L:  -- I think that's all they can report.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I don't think they can report anything else.  But --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know, things could be different in different states --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm really not sure.
R:  That's a -- that's -- it's one of my concerns.  And I've also thought about, like, you know, what if you go to a concert or something?  I -- I -- I don't go v- very much any more but I can remember years ago when I was young, going to a concert and people would be smoking pot all over the place.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And even if you weren't smoking pot --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- you were inhaling that --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know, and I'm thinking to myself, what happens if, like, y- -- I'm afraid to go anywhere now because God forbid, if I go some place and somebody's doing that, you know, how many parts per million are going to get into my blood stream --
L:  And that's a -- a real legitimate --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- concern.  Actually, I worked in human --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- resources for a number of years and I had a young person who tested positive w- -- I worked in a hospital --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- and he tested positive for pot and that's what he was claiming; that he was some place that they were smoking but he wasn't doing it.  Well, the hospital didn't accept the out- -- the, um, that explanation and he was not hired.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] you know, he w- -- he was --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- of age so that he could be tested but when he wasn't hired, he didn't tell his parents why, and his parents called the hospital and, you know, we had to work out, you know, what do you tell the parents?
R:  Oh, my Gosh!
L:  You know, what -- what should he be telling them?  And I mean, it really wasn't us to tell the parent anything 'cause it was conf- confidential between us and the potential employee.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it -- it opens a whole lot of --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- things that you -- you don't really expect.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  And I don't know what does show up.  You know, that's a really good point.  Does second hand marijuana smoke show up?  And --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know how -- 
L:  -- to what degree?
R:  Yeah.  How do they, you know, if -- well how -- at what point do they measure.  I -- I have a girlfriend who works for a company who administers drug testing --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- for, uh, big corporations like am- -- um, Conrail.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she travels around the country and does this, and does collections and stuff.
L:  Hm.
R:  And, uh, she said that we all have to some degree of -- [MN] s- some portion of -- of -- of -- of it in our system --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- but it's the amount.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I guess over a certain amount would mean that yes, you are actively participating.  So, I guess there's some t- tool of measurement --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they have -- 
L:  There must be.
R:  -- that they can differentiate between whether you are just sitting in a room inhaling second hand smoke or actually inhaling it yourself.  I don't know how that works but, um, [LIPSMACK] I've always been curious about that.
L:  The same thing happens -- I -- my brother --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- who's kind of a -- a large man, he works -- he -- he -- he's a driver.  And so he's randomly drug tested all the time.  And he [MN] ate, um, poppy seed bagels and, you know --
R:  Ye- --
L:  -- people s- -- have said no, that's a le- -- that's an urban legend, that's not really true --
R:  I avoid them.
L:  -- but it is true.  And he, I mean, when he eats he eats a lot, and he did test positive.  But they gave him the benefit of the doubt and they went back and they did a test, like, another day later or two days later and he was fine by that time.
R:  Yeah, I had heard --
L:  But ...
R:  -- that about poppy seed bagels --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I just avoid them on principal now.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  But, [COUGH] it's scary.  It's -- it's, um, but, you know, getting back to the topic at hand, um, I really, I have no problem with companies drug testing.  My only concern is that, you know, as -- as long as they're testing for illegal drugs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that my disclosing the fact that I use prescription drugs wouldn't preclude me from getting a job.
L:  Right.  And that's as it should be.  
R:  [COUGH] Other than that I don't think I'd have a problem with [MN] --
L:  I don't either.
R:  -- an- -- anybody, um, testing for illegal drugs.  Yeah, I mean, you know, I [MN] a few months, uh, back I heard a story about some pilots got on a plane and they'd all been drunk and --
L:  Oh, God!
R:  -- drinking and, you know, I mean, [LAUGH] there's so many positions where you can really hurt somebody whether you're drinking or you're -- you're using drugs or whatever.
L:  Sure.
R:  So, you know what?  If they're illegal and you shouldn't be doing them, I say drug test everybody.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, even --
R:  I don't have a problem with that.
L:  I don't either.  Yet look at even school systems and teachers and --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- you know, I don't have a problem with it at all.  That -- that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- fine with me.
R:  Absolutely.  I agree.
L:  Um, the -- the question it brings up then; if they're gonna d- -- test for illegal drugs, does this mean they're gonna start testing for alcohol at some point too?  I mean, alcohol's not an illegal drug.  I mean, it may --
R:  Right.
L:  -- be illegal in certain degrees, you know --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- over a certain level.  But --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I just -- I hate to see a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a government take it to [MN] what might be a next step.  So ...
R:  Right.  Well, I don't know that -- I don't know that, you know, I -- I -- I think that maybe there are already, like, procedures in place in some places.  If you show up obviously drunk on the job --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where, you know, um, some sort of action might be taken.  But I don't know that, you know, I don't know that being tested for alcohol on the job is -- would be such a bad thing either.
L:  I don't either.  It just --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- [SIGH] well how far do you take that?  Because that is illegal -- that's legal.
R:  It is legal --
L:  Although you shouldn't be drinking to excess [LAUGH] before you go to work either.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Exactly.  That's my point, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if, uh, I think that at some point there would have to be some kind of a line drawn --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- because alcohol is not illegal --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but at the same time it probably isn't in your best interests or your company's +best -- best interest for you to go to work loaded.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- so I don't know, random alcohol testing during an eight hour work day; I don't think it's such a bad thing.
L:  No.  [inaudible] 
R:  Um, you know, especially if you're in a position where, like, you're going to be driving --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- a school bus or a plane or whatever, then, uh, you know, I don't -- I don't have a problem with that either.
L:  No.  I really --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- don't either.
R:  Yeah.  I think that, um, the only people that are going to worry about something like this are the people that are using illegal --
L:  That are going to do it.
R:  -- drugs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then they're going to have a problem.
L:  Right.
R:  I'd recently heard that, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know what company was doing it; I don't even remember where I heard it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was, uh, there's some kind of a -- a product you can buy --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that you can flush your system out with --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- if you -- you use illegal drugs and it -- you'll get a clean reading.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh, yes.  And a company had caught on to the fact that people were doing this so what they started doing was testing people for that particular product --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- because they knew that if you used that product that you were a drug user.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it -- one- once they started testing people for the -- the flushing agent, then it became clearly obvious [LAUGH] and they didn't have to -- I guess test for drugs any more.  They just knocked people out of the ruining by, you know, if they came up hot for that particular flushing agent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know how true that is.  But I've -- I've never used any of that so I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I've never heard anything about that.  That's really interesting.
R:  Yeah.  They -- they -- there are things on the market that claim that you can use them and you will get a clean reading --
L:  Clean reading.
R:  -- on a dres- -- uh, drug test.  I was talking --
L:  Well, I think that's scary.
R:  -- to my cousin [MN] about that --
