R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi my name's Jackie.
L:  Hi I'm Sharon.  Where do you live Jackie?
R:  Um, Cumberland, Ohio.
L:  Okay I live Seymour, Indiana.
R:  Oh.
L:  So our topic is how does. Um, -- well it has to do with divorce and family values -- is that what you got out of it?
R:  Yeah it, um, something about that if. Um, -- like does it change our view of divorce or marriage or I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean the way I feel about it I think you know with the divorce rate being so high I think people should, um, be more careful before they get married because I think so many people now a days get married just thinking that well if it don't work out I'll get a divorce you know.
L:  Right well I mean I'm personally divorced myself so [LAUGH] --
R:  Well I mean sometimes there's no other solution it seems because I -- I you know I know a lot of different ones that have done that and some of the ones that haven't kind of wish they would of.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah --
L:  Well I was married for twenty five years so it's not like I just floated in and out so.
R:  Right.
L:  Anyway, are you married?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah I am I've been married for, um, thirty one and a half years.
L:  Well how old are you?  [LAUGH]
R:  Pardon?
L:  I'm glad for you.
R:  Oh, well it's a little hard to talk.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean because, um, I got everybody around me.
L:  Oh, I see.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well I'm alone so I can say anything.
R:  Well that's good.
L:  Anyway I mean I was raised in a family where divorce was just it was just shunned -- I mean I think I just about killed myself when I got a divorce I mean I just -- they didn't live real long after that I mean my mother had a stroke not too long afterwards --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Honestly I think it was a factor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean it was just absolutely not done so anyway and I have to say that really about anybody divorced I think less of them because of it but yet I feel okay about myself for doing it so isn't that crazy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean that's a double standard.
R:  Well I mean you know what you went through and I mean --
L:  Well I didn't precipitate it you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So anyway I guess you rationalize anything.
R:  Well yeah --
L:  Situation ethics.
R:  Well I mean there's just like I said sometimes when I think that maybe that's the only answer you know.  Um, --
L:  We had a lot of people that are married or miserable too I mean --
R:  Well yeah.
L:  I mean really.  I just often think and this maybe bitterness on my part and I'm good at that but I'm mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well honestly I wonder how many people that are married are really in love and happily married and I hope a lot are I mean I don't wish that on people but I think it's a very small minority.
R:  Well yeah I -- I think you're right.  [LAUGH], um, cause I -- you know I know it's not been role easy sometimes you know.
L:  Mhm.  Why it's hard --
R:  But have you got children?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Do you have children?
L:  Yeah I have three and they're all grown -- they're all college graduates and they were all really affected by the divorce I mean I think they all had trouble with dating and the middle child has never marred.  She's like about thirty six and I mean it's just taken its toll it was devastating for my girls.
R:  Was it like a drawn out with the kind of like drawn out or was it like a sudden --
L:  It was -- well I mean he told me he would leave me like and we lived that way for two years not knowing when it was going to happen --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and this was in the eighties so I mean -- but I've never remarried and he hasn't either but anyway.  I'm telling you divorce is awful I mean it is just -- it's mind boggling but I just -- I mean we're Christians and I just thought honestly -- honestly I'm not surprised that more people don't go -- I am surprised more people don't go out and shoot people when their -- I mean -- I tell you it just is you just have no idea how terrible it is.  I mean I've gotten over it I think it's just really mind altering at the time.
R:  Well I know exactly what you're say about you know that, um, no wonder that people [inaudible] shoot themselves because I know there are some pretty nasty things that go on out there you know that. Um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean you know you get yourself in all kind of trouble you know just by pretty much voicing your opinion sometimes.
L:   Mhm.  Well as you mentioned earlier I mean the divorce rate is -- it's ramped isn't it you know in the United States.
R:  It really is and I think maybe that's even why so many people choose to live together which I don't approve of that either you know I just think that they should, um, just be careful and you know make sure they know each other very well and then be committed to, um, to be faithful to each other and --
L:  My youngest daughter was saying -- well she sells [inaudible] cosmetics and she had done something at a bridal show at Indianapolis and she said she just came to the conclusion that most -- anyway she talked to various people that were going to get married and she said it's just living together is status quo I mean before you get married it's just -- that's just how bad everybody does it she -- with what she picked up talking all of these brides to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know I mean I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess then you know what you're getting.
R:  Well but then -- but then sometimes they change.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean got some that, um, you know kind of got your little crisis's and you know --
L:  I mean you could have a midlife crisis years after you got married.
R:  Yeah that's --
L:  See that coming.
R:  Right so I mean you have to live together for long long time you know.
L:  Right.
R:  For that so.
L:  So do you come from a family that's just pretty well divorce free -- I hope you do.
R:  Well, um, I've got three sisters and -- and, um, three of us have never divorced but I have a sister that's been married six times.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you know she married --
L:  And you're all out of the same womb.
R:  Yeah we both had the same mum same dad but she's been married six times but she married two of her husbands twice.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And then one of her other ex husbands she was engaged to him so she almost married him twice but then she -- before she married him for a the second time that he talked too much but you know --
L:  Well they say you keep marrying the same type person -- I mean haven't you heard something like that?
R:  Yeah and maybe that's why some you know maybe that's why people you know like in the case of my sister you know that --
L:  You're just also some people just born to marry losers.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah we used to teach her tell her tried -- you know to keep up with Elizabeth Taylor, you know like years ago and. um, -- now this one that she's married to now she's been married him twice and, um, so --
L:  Is she still married?
R:  Yeah she's married to him -- they -- they would -- his wife -- this guys wife left him for a younger man so I mean good at the time for him my sister met they got married well then his ex wife decided that she wants him back and they have children together so they had ties so he was sneaking around with the ex wife and so then my sister found out so then they got a divorce and then after his ex wife got him back show didn't want him anymore which is I think to see if she could get him back.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So then I think it was maybe six months or so later that my sister ended up taking him back and they've been married for I don't know like ten years now but it's crazy. 
L:  Well I hope -- sound like they're going to make it this time.
R:  Yeah it sounds like it I think he realizes what the ex was like you know and I think mainly he was just connected with her because of the kids you know.
L:  Well I work with a lady that's been married -- well she's divorced like three times and I mean she just got engaged over Christmas and she's going to marry this time actually word got out she was divorced -- she's marrying his brother and, um, he preaches on Sunday this guy she's going to marry and I mean this lady is so nice and I just -- I mean she's just such a nice person I just can't think that she's messing up every time so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- it's -- life is weird.
R:  Well my sister the one that's divorced she's got two daughters one's been married three times divorced three times and the other one's been married twice divorced twice and getting ready to get married for the third time and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I don't know.  Um, --
L:  You would seem to think that that had an effect on her kids wouldn't you.
R:  Yeah I -- I think it did.
L:  Well I've read that you know that if your parents are divorced chances are -- well you'll think mum is dad did it so why don't I you know if it doesn't work.
R:  Where as you know my mum and dad were married like fifty some years their both gone now you know but they you know married like fifty some years so -- but they had their rough times you know he put her through a lot.
L:  Yeah my parents are deceased too but I mean they certainly never divorced.
R:  Yeah mine almost did a couple of times.  [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon?
R:  I said mine almost did a couple of times you know my mum would leave and then she would come back.
L:  Really?
R:  Well he liked to drink and gamble and that's not a -- you know that's not --
L:  Oh, my dad -- my dad was just such a Christian I mean all he cared about was when he sold -- I'm telling you he's just I thought he ran the whole thing to the ground [inaudible] but I guess he didn't.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I mean it's just kind above me.
R:  Really?
L:  That's just all he wanted to do was stuff to do with church I mean all life which I don't know it just rubbed me the wrong way but anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess it would be bad as long as he's living, it's the one's that. Um, --
L:  Well he was.
R:  Yeah.  I mean that -- that makes a big difference but I know different ones not any of the goods where I go but, um, that go to church and then they're out cheating on their wife and stuff but yet they've got high standings in their church so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know so if your dad lives when he talked --
L:  He did.
R:  Now that's --
L:  I'll give him credit for that.
R:  [LAUGH] How was your mum?
L:  She
