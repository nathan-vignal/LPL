L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  This is Chrissie, I'm in Louisiana.
R:  Chrissie, hi, this is Mary.  I'm right outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's nice.  I have a friend in Philadelphia.  I've never been -- I mean, or rather in Pennsylvania.  I've never been there.
R:  Oh, it's a nice place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  So, what a topic we have --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, ah, the comp- -- I work for a very small family owned company, but they, um, do random testing on the -- not on us, but on the people that, like, maintain the parking lots and roofs and stuff like that and [LIPSMACK] --
R:  And are you --
L:  We've had to fire a couple of people for that.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And what do they test for?  It's just ...?
L:  I don't know.  Um, I mean, there's a big sign.  The lady that does personnel has a big sign on her door that says, "This is a drug free environment" and all this.  And we'll have people that'll come and work for, like, a day and then, you know, then leave because they can't pass the drug test. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know why bother, I guess they just wanted --
R:  Well, I think --
L:  -- a day's pay, you know.
R:  Or they think they can outsmart the system, or -- you know.
L:  Yeah.  No, but I mean they won't even take the test.  They'll just, you know, they'll work until it's time for their test to come up and then say, "Oh, sorry, can't pass the test".
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [LAUGH] It's weird.
R:  Now, why don't they give the test before they hire them?
L:  Well, um, I think they just go ahead -- if it's only a day or so, like I said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll go ahead and put 'em to work and schedule the test immediately, you know, and it's only happened a couple of times.
R:  Wow.
L:  And the person will work, like, half a day, or a day, and then, when it's time for them to go, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it puts us through a lot of paperwork for nothing.
R:  Oh.  And what is your opinion?  Do you think it's an okay thing, to have the --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- the drug testing?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, drugs are illegal.  You shouldn't, um -- I mean, you shouldn't, you know, it's not your right to do drugs in the -- in the workplace, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well, no, they're not necessarily doing them in the workplace --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  I mean, it's just a residual effect that's in their body.  They may well -- very well be doing them at home.
L:  Right.  That's true.  I mean, some jobs could be extremely dangerous, [LAUGH] you know, if they were on drugs.  But, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I know, you -- I mean, not every company tests for drugs.  If you don't want to submit to the test, go work somewhere else, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Right, exactly.  Exactly, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't have a problem with it because just -- I agree with you.  They are illegal --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- period.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's the bottom line.  It's -- it's not like it's an invasion of their privacy or anything, they're --
L:  I don't think so either.  
R:  You know --
L:  I mean, you know, you -- privacy doesn't cover illegal activities and --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if you murder somebody, that, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- it's not private either.  You know.
R:  You're right, exactly.  And that's --
L:  It's the law, so ...
R:  Yeah, and that's the law.  It -- it is illegal, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you don't want your employees to be involved in illegal activities.
L:  Yeah, I mean, our -- our people operate lifts and things like that.  And, you know, I mean, they're endangering other people as well, if they're on drugs, you know, so, because they work up on the roof and things like that and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- I mean, you just don't use good judgment, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Right.  But, yeah, again, they might be doing the drugs --
L:  On their own time, yeah.
R:  -- on their own time.  
L:  But, still, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, just like, if I have a drink in the evening, I'm very competent to work the next day.
L:  Right.
R:  It doesn't mean I'm, you know, I'm not capable of working.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, that's true.
R:  But drinking is not illegal.
L:  Right.
R:  And I guess that would be --
L:  Different.
R:  My opinion is just mainly because it's an illegal activity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is --
L:  Yeah.  When I worked at the New Orleans Convention Center, they started a new policy, um, this was a few years ago.  They started a new policy right before I left that, you know, if you were involved in an accident, then they would test you. [NOISE] And, you know, we weren't supposed to drink during working hours, and stuff like that.  But, I mean, suppose somebody came in at noon and had a drink before they came, you know.  I mean, then had an accident --
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  So, I mean, you know, having one drink, too, doesn't, uh, necessarily impair you.  But we kind of all had a --
R:  Well, I don't think you should be drinking at work, period [LAUGH].
L:  No, you shouldn't be drinking at work, but --
R:  Or -- or -- or on your way to work, period.
L:  Probably not, but, um --
R:  You know what I mean?  Uh, just as a responsible citizen, you just don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, and I'm sure there's lots of people that do that, but, um --
L:  Yeah, I mean, but those of us who had a desk jobs, too -- too, suppose we went and had a -- a drink for lunch or something.  What is that going to hurt, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.
R:  And I've done that, too.  I mean, I can't say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I haven't [LAUGH], you know --
L:  I mean, people -- 
R:  -- gone out for lunch and --
L:  Most people who drink have done it occasionally, and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- I mean, like I said, suppose I got into an accident when I came back to work, then I would have been fired because I had a drink for lunch.  And it's -- you know, technically I wasn't on company time, I was punched out, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Right, that's -- and that's probably how they would get around it for their insurance [NOISE] purposes and things like that.
L:  But, no, that was not their policy.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If they tested you, and you had anything in your system, and you had an accident, too bad, you're gone, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  So, uh, we all kinda had a problem with that, so ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.
R:  I guess there's two sides to every iss- -- you know, it depends on what side of the fence you're on, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess so, but, um ...
R:  And I think it's okay that they do it randomly.  Because if they announced when it was going to be --
L:  Right, then you just wouldn't do drugs for a week [LAUGH].
R:  Right, you would abstain, or there's -- I'm sure there's different herbs and things like that that you can probably dupe the systems with, if you knew --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, that the test was forthcoming.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know.
L:  I'm sure.
R:  So, I think if you're gonna have the drug testing, then it kinda --
L:  Then it has to be random.
R:  -- has to be random [LAUGH].  
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  You know.  That's -- that's the best way that you're gonna find the offenders, is to do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, it's interesting though, that at your place they do it before -- you know, as a condition of employment.
L:  Right.  But then they have some random testing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as well, yeah.
R:  And that's a small company that does that?
L:  Yeah, very small company.
R:  Okay.
L:  No, there's -- there's, like, ten people in the office and then, like -- so we have a crew -- we own some commercial real estate, and we have a crew that, you know, cleans the parking lots and plants the pansies and stuff and --
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  -- yeah, maintains the roof --
R:  [NOISE] Right, okay.
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Now, I work also for a small company, and I'll have to look in my employee manual, 'cause I know we have some wording in there [NOISE] about it, um, but I think it's very loose.  I think it just says, "We are a drug free" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  Well, see, they don't test the office staff at all.  Which I don't, you know ...
R:  Well, now, I would have an issue with that.  Are they discriminating against --
L:  Yeah, but since I'm office staff, I don't bring up the issue, but I would have an --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Absolutely, yeah, I wouldn't either.  I wouldn't either, if I were you, but, if I was on the other end of the fence, I would --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "You know, if you're gonna test me, then you have to test everybody".
L:  Yeah.  Also, we get more holidays than them, and we don't have to use the time clock, but, I mean, I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  I guess they just consider us different.  But, I mean, the drug testing probably should be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- across the board, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  It should, if I --
L:  I don't have a problem with that, but like I said, I'm not going to raise the issue --
R:  Right, exactly.  And I agree with you --
L:  -- since it doesn't -- it doesn't discriminate against me.
R:  -- but if I was on the other -- right.  If I was on the other side of the fence --
L:  Right, I probably would.  
R:  You know, I would say, I would be like, "Wait a minute, if you're gonna do this to me, then, you know, in all fairness --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- you have to test everyone".
L:  But I found out a long time ago, at least in Louisiana, um, as long as you have fifty employees or less, you can pretty much do whatever you want and there's nothing they can do about it, you know.
R:  Really?
L:  You come to work and they don't like the color of your socks, they can fire you [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Oh, okay.
L:  I guess that's why nobody really complains.  And, I mean, there is no, um -- I mean, of course there is age discrimination and sex discrimination and things like that, but other -- other than that, I mean, you don't have to have a reason to fire them.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You can do what you want [LAUGH], you know, as long as you have less than fifty employees.
R:  Really?  I didn't realize that.
L:  I've -- I can't think of the -- the term for it, but there is no law that, you know, that protects the employees, except in bigger companies --
R:  Really?
L:  -- in Louisiana.
R:  Is that just in Louisiana, or is that a -- [NOISE]
L:  Oh, well, it's in some states.  I mean, you know, I -- I don't think it's across the board.  There are states that have laws that protect the employees, you know, where -- that you have to have a good reason --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to fire them.
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  But, um --
R:  That's a shame for -- if that's just in Louisiana, that's a shame because [LAUGH] --
L:  No, it's not just [LAUGH] -- I mean, our laws are different.  We're still under Napoleonic Code, but, um, that -- that's not -- that's not the reason for that.  It's just, like I said, that, you know, some -- you -- the state would have to have a specific law protecting the employee, and we don't have that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, you know, there are other states that don't have it either.  I don't know which ones they are, but --
R:  So, I guess when the employees are protected in larger firms, maybe it's a federal law that is protecting them?
L:  Yeah, possibly so.
R:  I mean, it would have to be, I would think.  Otherwise ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how are they protected?  I mean --
L:  I don't know, I just know it -- that it's, you know, fifty -- fifty or less you can do what you want.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's considered a small business, and --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- you know, the employees have no protection. 
R:  That's a shame, because --
L:  Ah, but that was the -- the, um --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- example that the attorney l- -- used.  If, you know, they don't like the color of your socks, they can fire you -- send you home.  Um --
R:  Oh, how 'bout that, you learn something new every day.
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  I don't know that I'll be traveling to your great state then [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, it's not that bad.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's different, so ...   Just don't come to work here.
R:  There you go.
L:  Or work for a big company. 
R:  Or work for a large company, yeah.
L:  But I've found, you know, after fourteen years at the convention center, that was a big company, I've found that I like the small business better.  It's just --
R:  Yeah, I agree with you --
L:  You know --
R:  I came from corporate America, and, uh, would much rather work for a small company, [NOISE] you know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I know, going in, that I don't have the protection, but, you know, there are a lot of benefits to it.  They're a whole lot more understanding when you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do need something personal, and, you know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- it's more like a family [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Mhm.  Oh, definitely, yes.  Trying to think what else I can say on this topic here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Our time is almost up, or ...
L:  Well, let's see.  I wasn't keeping up with it.  I have my timer set for, oh, cooking dinner [LAUGH], puttering around --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in my kitchen, but, um, I think we've been on the phone maybe about seven minutes.
R:  Just a coupla minutes?  Oh, I can talk to anybody about anything, you know, I can just -- 
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- keep on going here, you know.
L:  -- I know, I always get off topic on these too, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I wonder, um -- okay, so the topic was how [NOISE] you feel about drug testing, [inaudible] and ... [NOISE] ... ah ...
L:  Well, I feel like it -- it's necessary.  I mean, you know, like I said, it depends.  Like, you know, if you have an electrician or something, [LAUGH] they're doing drugs --
R:  If you have what?  I'm sorry, what was that?
L:  An electrician or somebody, you know, they're going to be endangering the whole company if [LAUGH] they're doing drugs.
R:  Okay.  
L:  So, I mean, you know, I think it's a good thing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't necessarily want to be working with people doing drugs, even if they're not endangering you, you know.
