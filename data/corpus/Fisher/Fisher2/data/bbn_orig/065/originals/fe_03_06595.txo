L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, my name is Ally and I'm from the Boston area, Massachusetts.
R:  Okay, this is Shakier[?] from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, [SIGH] okay.  So censorship?
R:  So, right, and do public schools have the right to, um, allow or disallow students to read certain books?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that was right.  Okay.  Well, let's see, public schools, I -- I think they would have the right to disallow students to read certain books.  I mean, it is government fun- funded.  If it was a private school, then I'd say, you know, um, they do have the right.  You know, if parents are paying for their child's education, then I would say the school does have the right, depending on, you know, what the parents' view was.
L:  Mm.
R:  But in terms of public school I don't think that they really have the right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To say what books should be read.
L:  I agree with that, certainly.  And though there are a few occasions where, um, in Boston area public schools where they tried not to let, like, for example, there's a law that not too many people are aware of, but Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is not permitted to be read in Boston public schools because of anti Semitic sentiments in it.
R:  Okay.
L:  And as much as I don't like the play because of those things, I don't think that this is fair at all.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, it's kind of interesting, but, um, yeah.
R:  That's definitely a part of life though.  I mean, for a public school to say that, you know, they can't read that particular book, it's -- I think it's giving kids a really narrow mind of, I mean, you -- you -- you have to -- to live in this world you have to know that there are certain views out there, no matter how pleasant or unpleasant that they are; do you know what I mean?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And it's -- it's totally unrealistic, um, to -- to not want them to encounter anti Semitic literature.
L:  Yeah, it's like, what are you -- what are you hiding from exactly?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you have to deal with it, but, you know, I mean, I think their people are missing out on a valuable history lesson as well.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  I think this kind of falls in line with the -- with the issue of whether God should be mentioned in public schools.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you know what I mean?  Ah, when something is -- I don't know, I -- when something's funded by the -- by the government like public schools are, I just think that it's so -- it's such an array of different things, you can't expect kids to, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] to -- to just have this kind of focus, kind of curriculum I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Well, like, in terms of religion in school, I think it's vital to teach about religion because in a lot of cases religion is what causes the world to go around, but you absolutely should not be telling people that, like, the ten commandments has to be posted here because it's -- it's just because it's like the most popular religion in this particular country doesn't mean that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's the only one or it's the best one.  [SIGH] But like, I'm not a Christian and I kind of find it offensive when people put that in my face.  They just assume that I'm a Christian.
R:  Right, and neither am I.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So I understand what you're saying.
L:  Yeah, and -- and it's -- it's hard for people to understand that sometimes.
R:  Right, right.  Actually, it's pretty funny because, um, I went to a public college.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or a public university.
L:  So did I.
R:  And one of the requir- -- readings for the school was, and I'm not sure if the -- if the topic is for just elementary level schools or middle schools or what, but for the university level, we had this class that we had to, um, in this class we had to -- well, actually everyone had to take intellectual heritage.
L:  Mm.
R:  And in intellectual heritage, you were basically in -- there's one in two and you're basically reading the -- the main works of I guess civilization so to speak, like we -- we read a lot of, um, a lot of Machiavelli and whatever in the second part, but in the first part, we read different religious texts, and I felt like they concentrated more on the Bible than other religious texts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and it wasn't just my own, you know, personal view, other people expressed the same view.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I just kind of thought that it's along the same lines is that -- that although you're being totally inclusive, you're absolutely showing favoritism over one school of thought.
L:  Mm.
R:  Do you know what I mean?  And this is a public university.
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]
R:  But it's taught by individuals so what are you going to do?
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  It's just -- like, I go to my school especially to see if I can find something that's different from what I originally experienced.  I mean, I grew up in this little town north of Boston, and everybody's Christian there, and there's one Jewish family in the entire town, and I wanted to find different things.  I have yet to take some of those classes, and, like, I go to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's a pretty diverse school and the student body is pretty, like, aware of those kinds of things and like whether or not somebody is being fairly represented, but still I find it overwhelmingly aiming just -- not really aiming, I just feel like they settle into the Christian thing because they just don't think about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Takes responsibility. [SIGH]
R:  Sure.
L:  You know.
R:  And it -- I think it's easier -- I think in a way it's a safe way to go.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know that if people are Christians and they're going to listen to it, and, you know, if they are non Christian and they live in this country they're probably used to hearing about it anyway so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So and yeah, it's a safe way to go but I did hear about some professors who really just unjustly criticized other religious texts and make, you know, really prejudice comments about those kind of things.  And I think that when you talk about whether kids can read or not read certain things in public schools, you have to realize that these courses are going to be taught by individuals and they're going to have their own prejudices about things either way, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And even though some things, um, I don't know, I would definitely say like, um, things like that are too Mitchell[?] were for like elementary school students or whatever shouldn't be read in public school like, um, -- this is totally off the topic, but there was one thing.  Do you remember the whole Harry Potter thing?  I don't know which --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- state it was in, it was in a southern state and --
L:  Mm.
R:  There was, um, I don't think -- I don't think it was a church, maybe like a school or something where they burned all the Harry Potter books.
L:  Mm, 'cause of the witchcraft element.
R:  Because of the witchcraft and I don't know -- see, I can't remember if -- if it was a public school or not, but I don't know, that's like -- that's a really sensitive topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess that that's my own prejudice because I feel like witchcraft isn't really mainstream and for it to be taught in the public school where I would assume that most of the people follow one of three or four different religions, you know, that's a really soft -- that's a soft spot for a lot of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that kind of thing I would think that you should seek a parent's approval before you present that to a public school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's so popular amongst kids, I don't know.  I guess they thought it would be okay.
L:  You see, what I find funny about the whole of it is that the author of those books said over and over again that she invented all of the supposed witchcraftness in the entire book.  It's all pretend, so they're burning books that are, like, fictional.
R:  Right.
L:  Magic anyways.
R:  Right.
L:  But I don't know, it seems like when in doubt, it's just better to allow it, I don't know.  It's kind of a risky statement.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's kind of interesting.  I mean, I've -- I had, um, an experience with just improperly chosen books for, um, younger kids because I went to a Catholic elementary school and they had this kind of draconian summer reading program.
R:  Hm.
L:  Like when you were going into the fourth grade you were expected to read, like, four books and write full book reports about them, and a lot of parents complained because they felt like chained to this homework, and one of the books that they recommended among others wa- -- similar books was a book called The Tree Grows In Brooklyn.  Have you ever read that?
R:  No.
L:  It's a coming of age book, very much geared for older teenagers.
R:  Right.  I've heard about that book.
L:  I really liked it, but I was also in college when I read it and I could not believe that they recommended this, a Catholic school recommended this for third --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- going into fourth grade, and clearly it turned out after some questioning that they had never even read the book [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] that's pretty funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's pretty funny.
L:  It is ridiculous. [LAUGH] like, I can't believe you're marching around telling me that you're in authority and stuff like that and then you do that.  How can I trust you?  But, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  I guess that's an extreme example of the opposite.
R:  Right, and it's kind of what I'm -- what I'm thinking is that when you say public schools, what you're really talking about is just a bunch of individuals who are sitting on a board who are deciding how things should go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And each of those individuals are going to have their own opinion as to what should be read and -- and what age kids are going to be ready to experience what, and it's just a fine line, you know what I mean?
L:  Mm.
R:  For one person, um, ah, I don't know, it's just, um, -- I don't know, I don't [LAUGH] I was going to say maybe they should just stay away from books, just teach like math and science and like really, really safe literature or something.
