L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi.  This is Sharon.
R:  Wha- what's your name?
L:  Sharon.
R:  Did you -- you heard the question?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Well, what do you think?
L:  What's your name?
R:  My name's Joe.
L:  Hi, Joe.  Um --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- well, ah, I kinda have mixed feelings about it, uh, them televising high publicity trials.  I think um that some attorneys would seize to manipulate the system to their advantage.  To further their career.  
R:  Right.  And then you get into the problem like with the OJ Simpson trial where whatever's going on -- I mean, it was way over watched on TV, way too much on TV.  Day and night, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then all the programs that are gonna analyze everything said and then reanalyze everything said and the trial actually played out in the media more than in the court room. 
L:  Yes, I agree.  It was kinda --
R:  I think that they -- you know, everybody should be entitled to the same justice and they wouldn't, you know, be televising an ordinary person's trial.
L:  Right.
R:  And sensationalizing it, so it gives the appearance, even if it's not true, it gives the appearance that if -- if you're rich, that you get special treatment.  
L:  Right.  
R:  And that shouldn't be that way.  I mean it -- it's -- it should be justice not, you know, money, but unfortunately that's not always the case.  
L:  Right.  I ah --
R:  And al- also I would be worried about witnesses, you know.  If you know you're on television, there may be people that don't want to be on television or there may be on to- people who, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- overplay it for the cameras and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I just wonder how it'd affect everybody.  
L:  That's true.  
R:  You know?
L:  I never thought about that aspect because, yeah, they -- 'cause even when they're -- wh- even if you're just a witness and you're like -- they'll ask you background questions about yourself and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- so he may not want to have to shift -- you know what I mean --
R:  You don't want to tell the whole nation.
L:  -- not want it publicized, yes.
R:  But on the other hand, there's gonna be some that, you know, that may be a key witness that they're thinking, you know, David Letterman Show and Jay Leno and you know, whatever can come after that and so they may embellish the testimony just to -- to stay on TV, you know?  There's -- so you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think it's a risk either way.
L:  Well, you know, I saw -- today on the news I saw you know that Lacey Peterson girl that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in California?
R:  Who was pregnant and --
L:  Getting ready -- so they're getting ready to have uh, you know, a trial,  just in a trial her husband, but I saw today, you know, the other woman that --
R:  That he was having an affair with?
L:  Yeah, she didn't know he was married.
R:  Right.  
L:  I saw to-
R:  Or she says she didn't know, whatever.
L:  Yeah.  I saw today where she had, um, she ha- had an attorney representing her now, and it's a high profile -- I don't know her na- I can't remember her name, was a high profile woman lawyer with the big mouth[?].  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, is that --
L:  Not that they're --
R:  She got --
L:  -- all --
R:  She got blonde --
L:  -- all big mouth --
R:  hair?
L:  No, she's -- she's got -- I think it's dark hair.
R:  Huh.
L:  And she's kinda loud and she's from -- I think she's from California and I think she did -- I think she had to apolo- I'm not sure if she has apologized or anyway, I just -- I thought, "Man, she got her high prof- profile lawyer".
R:  What does she need a lawyer for?
L:  Well, probably to protect her interests and there's probably going to be like a TV movie and --
R:  Right.
L:  I -- all of a sudden --
R:  'Cause she's -- she's a pivotal --
L:  -- all of a sudden she shows up -- 
R:  -- person.
L:  Yeah.  All of a sudden she shows up with an attorney, you know, this real high profile attorney --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well, you know why the [inaudible].
R:  Well, sure, ca- I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  There wa- she doesn't have the money for that kind of a lawyer.
L:  No.
R:  But it's, um, some kind of contingency, but see, she was -- she came forward to the police about having an affair with him and then the police used her --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as a decoy, you know?  She -- she did hours and hours of recording with him over the phone, wire tapping.
L:  Right.  I -- I really don't think she thought he was married or she may have suspected that -- I think he --
R:  Someb- 
L:  -- was kinda living a double life or something. 
R:  Girls -- women tell me they can always tell when a man's married.  I don't know. 
L:  She -- she like had him around her family and stuff.  Even her family didn't -- they didn't --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  You didn't learn a thing, though.  Yeah.
R:  But I mean, it was like the things like oh, she couldn't call him whenever she wanted to and --
L:  Yeah, Christmas, he was going out --
R:  You know, it's just different things that would seem strange, you know, if you were single, living alone, you know?  
L:  Sh- she probably just thought that but she probably didn't know.  Oh, you know?  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I think --
R:  Well, sometimes we, you know, love does stupid things to people, you know?  You like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somebody and you want to always believe the best and you just believe anything they tell you.  I know.  I been there and done it and you know?
L:  Yeah.  I mean [LAUGH].
R:  And we never learn.  I guarantee you.  Never learn.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's all right.  Um, but I -- I -- I don't know.  I -- I -- I'm always suspicious because there's always two or three sides to every story and --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- I'm just curious, like, when some -- you know, like 'cause it -- but it -- it went on and it happened and everything, and these people come out of the woodwork later on.  I -- I just wonder, you know, if it's their conscience that always got them to do it or if they're looking for --
L:  Right.
R:  Somebody's looking for any of the wrong reasons, if they're looking for notoriety or if they're looking for money or a book deal or a movie deal or guest appearances on TV.  Then everything they do has to be suspect because they're gonna be on a campaign to promote them, whatever their thing is, you know?  So they may not always tell the truth or they may em- exaggerate.
L:  Right.  Well, we -- I know -- I know -- I follow her first when she first -- her first interview -- first public statement she made and she -- I think she made it because she knew she'd been found out.  Anyway, she thought maybe if she came forward or whatever, the police --
R:  They'd go easy on her.
L:  -- advised her -- the police advised her to have a public statement and she -- I saw it and she was literally shaking.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you could tell she was upset and she was nervous.  She was a -- literally shake -- she did not want to be there.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I -- I -- I kind of thought from the beginning he was, you know, and the reason -- the thing -- the big deal with that case is, I -- what man who would have a wife that's expecting their first baby, that's eight months' pregnant --
L:  I know.
R:  -- leaves on Christmas Eve and goes --
L:  I know.
R:  -- a hundred miles away and goes fishing --
L:  To go fishing.
R:  -- by himself?  By himself?
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's weird.  [LAUGH].  
R:  I know a lot of fishermen, I know a lot of people that don't even like their wives, or wives that don't like their husband that much, but not Christmas.  Not eight months' pregnant.  Not fishing by themself.  You know, I mean, it's like no- just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so much of that, it's no- just seems like a big crock.  I mean, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of other alibis I might of -- I might of fallen for, but you know, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fi- fishing is kind of a thing you like to do with a friend, first of all.  And second of all, you know, he -- he couldn't be so coldblooded that he would go off and leave her home alone on Christmas Eve and she's eight months' pregnant.  You know?
L:  Yeah.  I think --
R:  I mean --
L:  I -- I think something happened at the house and I think he -- something bad happened and -- and then --
R:  I think he told her he was --
L:  I don't -- I don't know he necessarily -- I don't think he -- but you know, set out to kill her, but I think that's a -- you know, they got in a fight or something.  And he lost it --
R:  She may have told him she wouldn't give him a divorce.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  It's hard to say, but --
R:  And he lost his temper.
L:  -- I don't think -- I don't think he planned on it because if you plan on it, I think he would've done it differently.  You know?  I don't know, but I -- it -- are -- are they gonna televise his trial, do you know?  Have you heard?
R:  Well, hi- his lawyer's fighting for them not to.  
L:  Oh.
R:  But uh, but it doesn't matter if they televise it or not, it'll be on TV constantly once it starts, you know, all the --
L:  Oh, yeah, the --
R:  -- the little recaps and the different stuff.
L:  Play by play, yeah.  
R:  You know? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it -- it -- you know, it's like -- I don't know, our justice system is great and it works and I'm not knocking it.  It works very good in most countries, but it is for sale.  It's just like medical care.  Well, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lawyers and doctors and dentists, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it all goes by what you can afford.  You buy the generic kinda aspirin, or -- when you have a headache, or do you go to a specialist and get him to write you a prescription?  You know, it's uh -- it's all medical care, but the quality, you know?
L:  Right.  
R:  And I would hate to think that, you know, you could do anything in this world and get away with it if you have enough money, but I almost believe it's true.  
L:  Oh, I do, too.  I know -- I know you can just -- you get different -- treated differently.  
R:  Well, sure.  
L:  I used to work in um -- I used to work in State Government, at a pretty high level and um, yeah, there -- there are different sets of rules for different people and stuff.
R:  And things are overlooked.  I live in a small town and if you're a certain family or related to certain people, you know, uh, when you get stopped by the police, they -- they never give you a ticket.  They let you pass.  They'll stand there and pretend like they're giving them a ticket, but they don't.  You know?  
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  And just because of -- of some connection and I don't know, it's -- it's -- really, it shouldn't be that way, but you know?
L:  Into a reality and --
R:  That what it should be and what it shouldn't be is two different things.  It's uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess, you know, lawyers say, "Well you know, we have to compete and if you know, if we're -- you know, an exceptional lawyer and we're better than the other one, we should get paid more money", but I would rather --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have a lawyer that's not famous, that's -- that knows the law, that will just stay at it like a bulldog, you know? 
L:  Right.  
R:  Than a Johnny Cochrane, that's just, you know, just --
L:  Yeah, a trickster.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But see, remember --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the Rodney King ca-
