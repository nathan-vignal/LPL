L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm William.
L:  Oh, hi.  I'm Melanie.
R:  Hi, Melanie.
L:  Hi.  Um, this is only my second time doing this.  [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's uh -- it's kind of interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, where -- where are you located?
R:  Oh, I'm down in, um, Southern California.
L:  Oh, me too.  Where?
R:  Oh, in Laguna Hills.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in -- in Feno[?].
R:  Oh, where -- where's -- oh, is that San Diego County?
L:  No, San Fernando Valley.  You're thinking of [inaudible].
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  No, San Fernando Valley.  
R:  That's right.  That's right.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause that's just a little bit north of here.  I think.
L:  Right, yeah, about uh, a little over an hour.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause my sister lives in Huntingdon Beach.  Anyway, so, topic --
R:  Huh?
L:  -- topic?  Um, well the most famous, OJ.  
R:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Was that -- wasn't that in LA or somewhere?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Like -- like somewhere in LA.
L:  Downtown LA, yeah.
R:  It was downtown LA?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I don't understand why they only have, um, like just drawings.  I've always underst- never understood --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- why they never have, like live televised coverage.  
L:  They did.  I mean, they --
R:  Of the trial?
L:  Sure.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Didn't they?
R:  Of course, the big thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  For some reason, I thought it was only, like, drawings or something?
L:  Yeah.  No.
R:  Artist's sketch.
L:  I thought it was real.
R:  Just --
L:  'Cause it -- cause regular TV wasn't on for, like, a long time. 
R:  Yeah, it's just --
L:  That's what makes me angry.  You know?
R:  I think --
L:  When they take --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry?
L:  -- they take off my shows, you know, like my soap operas --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- to air these all day.
R:  Yeah.  So, so do you like -- do you like it if they only -- if they limit the coverage per day or --
L:  Yeah.  Maybe.
R:  They don't interfere --
L:  It's like you don't have a choice, because why -- why do they need to have it on every channel?  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good point, huh?  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- that's true.
L:  Now that I'm thinking back.  
R:  As opposed to having maybe one dedicated channel?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, just for like high profile --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know -- let's say for example like, uh, besides OJ, who else --
L:  Mhm?
R:  -- what else is a high prof- profile?
L:  I'm trying to think.  Oh, the Anita -- Anita -- what was her name?
R:  Oh, Anita Hill?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That one with uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Clarence Thomas, I think?
L:  Right.  That was on -- that was high profile, um -- oh well, like OJ again.  Um, now you think of one?
R:  Uh, what about, um, what about the Enron scandal?  
L:  I didn't --
R:  Enron scandal?   
L:  I didn't really get into that one.
R:  That's pretty high profile, right?
L:  I didn't get into that one much.  Um --
R:  Or maybe some of the scandals on Wall Street.
L:  I'm thinking of criminal stuff, the Mendan- -- Menendez brothers?
R:  Oh, the --
L:  That's been a while.
R:  The ones who killed their parents or something?
L:  Their parents, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was on a lot.  
R:  Yeah.  I -- I guess --
L:  It's interesting, but then it's -- you know, it makes you, me anyway, kinda angry with the attorneys because you see them defending someone they know is guilty.
R:  Mm.
L:  Or pretty much assume that -- you know, like OJ.
R:  Right.  Like OJ, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although depending on who you talk to, you know, that -- that -- you can probably hear, like, two sides of the story.  
L:  Oh, I know, but it --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It's um -- that particular one was -- had too many holes.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Definitely.  Th- the thing is, you know, sometimes is it -- you're thinking that -- you think that -- well, assuming that they pick their jury, you know, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- devoid of, you know, any type of --
L:  Prejudice, right.
R:  Any prejudice, right --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that it shouldn't affect, you know, uh, you know, like our opinions outside the court room really shouldn't affect the trial.
L:  Mm.  But um, it did.  I mean, it was hard because it affected -- oh, Rodney King.  There's another one.
R:  Rodney King, yes.   In LA, too.
L:  That one went on forever and ever.  
R:  That one, I thought, uh, do they -- did -- they didn't have a um -- well, they didn't have it televised, right?  Is that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was the topic?  Uh --
L:  Televised, yeah.
R:  You -- you feel that they should be televised, the trials, high profile trials?
L:  Um, yeah, I guess I was.  More so.  Um, do I?  Ah, do you?  Yeah, that is the topic, do we feel it should be on TV?  
R:  Yeah.  I'm still trying to get a handle --
L:  Well, the think the issue is not -- don't put it on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on every channel.
R:  Yeah.  Your wish is don't have it on any -- any -- every channel 'cause it takes away -- there's a switching cost, right?  [LAUGH].
L:  No, it's just that, you know, like -- my soap operas.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, you don't want your soap operas to be, like, taken away.  Just want a choice.
L:  Right, right, right.  
R:  Actually, you can probably -- like, to solve that problem, you can probably use, uh, you know, maybe like TBO[?] or Sonic --
L:  Yeah, I didn't have it at the time.  I do have it now.
R:  You do have it now, so --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Probably something like that probably wouldn't affect it now, right?
L:  I -- I don't know.
R:  I mean, if --
L:  I don't know --
R:  -- there was a --
L:  -- if it's the entire country when they do that or -- or not.  
R:  -- televised --
L:  If it's still being filmed, you know, elsewhere.
R:  You -- you know, because they'll still have coverage of it, but what they'll do is they'll have those artist's sketches or drawings.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I'm -- I'm just trying to think that whether or not having -- if -- if -- if you have actual cameras in there, if it would make it more sensational, and you're wondering if the people inside the court room, if they would start pandering -- or not pandering, but if they would start --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- catering their defense or -- or the prosecution uh -- or actually both, yeah.  Um, I mean, uh, defense.  Yeah, to uh -- uh, the public's opinion.  You know, if you know you're --
L:  Right, with the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, uh, jury is sequestered.  They're -- they're not really hearing or seeing the news or hearing what we're hearing.
R:  Right.
L:  Or knowing what we're talking about.
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  But um, I don't know, it's -- it's a whole new age.  I don't know how old you are, but I'm a whole sight older than you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].  That, um --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- to televise these things was just really -- they used to be private and now everything's out in the open.
R:  Right.
L:  And everyone -- everyone knows what's going on.  Um --
R:  That's the -- I guess one question is, do you think that serves the role of democracy, having -- having a televised trial?  Or does that defeat it in the sense that you -- you may allow public opinion to sway?
L:  But like I said, though --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- they -- they're not hearing the public opinion, the jury.
R:  Well, do you think that's kinda -- and judges can't be, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- informed that way.
L:  I think it's frustrating because where you have no say --
R:  I remember there was a --
L:  -- we can only watch it.
R:  There was one famous judge who was for the death penalty.
L:  Mhm?
R:  In -- in the State of California.
L:  Mhm?
R:  But be- but I think -- was she elected by -- are judges -- are some judges publicly elected?
L:  I can't say for sure.  
R:  Yeah, I think her name's -- I think her name was Rose Byrd or something like --
L:  Well, that sounds very well known.  
R:  And -- and uh, and she was well known for her anti -- anti um -- death penalty stance.
L:  Really?  Yeah.
R:  And I think that a lot of people -- you know, they were uh -- you know, they tried to influence the outcome of her election or something.
L:  Mhm?
R:  And she was [inaudible] or something.  So I'm wondering if any of these judges -- probably not, 'cause they're uh, appointed right?  
L:  I think so.  But -- but look at, um, the OJ case?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was very mixed emotion 'cause we knew from Rodney King if he was guilty, there'd be another --
R:  Riot.
L:  -- riot.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Okay?  So I think so many things went into the outcome --
R:  Right.
L:  -- from the public.
R:  Right.
L:  And it was scary, because on one hand, it -- maybe he should of been convicted, and it was too -- it was scary to think that there was gonna be another riot.
R:  Mm.  
L:  You remember the Rodney King riots?
R:  I hear what you're saying.
L:  You -- you remember --
R:  So you're saying that --
L:  -- remember when that happened?  
R:  Uh, was that in the eighties or nineties or -- early eighties or early nineties?
L:  It wasn't that long ago.  Nineties.  
R:  Nineties probably, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So you know, I lived through the Watts[?] riots.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  At the [MN] mid sixties.  
R:  No kidding?  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I wasn't even here.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  In Southern California.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I was a teenager, but I was here. 
R:  [LAUGH].  Wow.
L:  Actually living even closer.  So um --
R:  Yeah, so I guess what you're saying is that if you're -- if you televise it, you may incite public --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- uh --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- incite public uh, unrest?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Mm.  
L:  And -- and -- yeah, just like -- well, with the Rodney King one, they -- the, uh man that was beaten really badly --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  Right.
L:  And it was on TV over and over and over and how could you not be influenced?  
R:  So that I guess that would be one negative against uh, having televised coverage, right?
L:  Right.  Right.  And then when the man is -- almost put on a pedestal --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for what he did, and then the policemen, they were on trial, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  On TV.
R:  I -- I heard mixed sides to that story.  I heard, like, um, some pe- the police were obviously pro -- obviously pro -- you know, this and uh they were, you know, obviously um felt that they were in the right.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And --
L:  Right.  It -- well, in that particular case --
R:  I actually forgot about that.  The trial.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know the details.  
L:  In that particular case, it was black and white. 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, seriously.  It was -- it was -- it was -- if -- if -- if they all had been one race, it would've been a very different --
R:  I see.
L:  I think.
R:  Right.
L:  In fact, I can tell you when it was.  It was, like in nineteen -- oh, God.  Let me think.  Um -- 
R:  Can always do a Google search.  [LAUGH].
L:  No.  Yeah, I know, no, but I remember where I was.  I was in Las Vegas the day of --
R:  Oh, I -- 
L:  It was the outcome, anyway.  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And why I was there?  Let's see.  That's -- I guess about six years ago.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Seven.  Somewhere around there.  
R:  Six or seven years ago?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Wow.  
L:  Time goes by too quick.  But anyway, so -- so I guess just getting back to the -- the topic of should they be televised?  I think --
R:  Well, let's try to -- you -- you brought up a good example about why it should not be televised.   Let's see if we can think of a -- a good reason why it should be.
