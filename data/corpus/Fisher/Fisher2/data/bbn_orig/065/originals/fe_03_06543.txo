L:  Hi, my name is Lois.
R:  Hi, my name is Stephanie.
L:  Um, I guess, what part of the country do you come from?
R:  I'm in California. 
L:  Okay, I'm in Iowa.
R:  Oh.  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  You're the first person I've talked to hasn't been in California [LAUGH]. 
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  Um, are you an employee or an employer?
R:  Um, I'm an employee.
L:  Okay.  I have been an employee, but I'm also an employer, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- on this issue I have probably differing opinions [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH].  
L:  Um --
R:  How do you feel as an employee?
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] As an employee, [MN] um, [LIPSMACK] I guess on -- on the one hand, I think it's all right, because I would have nothing to hide.  Um, on the other hand I think that what I do in the off time is my own -- my own business --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and I don't know that it affects my work.
R:  Right, right.
L:  How do you feel?
R:  Um, I think I feel the same way.  I think I've been drug tested only for one job, and it was a job I had in college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was a retail job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I don't know, I kinda thought it was strange, just because, um, ah, just because I didn't feel like being drug tested -- like if you -- if you had a -- you know, if you cleared the drug test, I didn't think that it was necessarily a good indication of what kind of performance you would have on the job.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean, I -- I -- I passed, of course, 'cause I didn't have anything to hide.  But I -- I remember thinking that it just seemed kind of a strange job to test for -- for drugs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I could understand if you would be -- I could almost understand if you'd be operating, like, heavy machinery or if you were [MN] in charge of, like, government secrets or something, to where, you know, if you were on drugs, you would probably, you know, fail at doing that.  But I thought for a job [MN] doing customer service --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- at an -- at an electronics store --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wh- -- it just seemed really silly.  And it -- it -- it was honestly kind of sad, because it was a pretty good indicator of what kind of community I was living in at the time.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Just because there is a lot of, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a lot of, uh, drug use in that particular community, and I thought it was kind of sad that a lot of employers resorted to the -- to drug testing for even just, you know, customer service positions.
L:  For a simple job.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think that's, um -- that's, like you say, a -- a sad reflection on the, ah, situation, I guess, or the environment that is there. 
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [SIGH] I guess, [NOISE] you know, I -- I guess, on the other hand, might be as well, is that if I, as an employee, am [LIPSMACK] doing my best at a certain job and a fellow worker comes in and, even though they're not, um, debilitative repaired[?], um, I could tell a difference in their performance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, because of some type of drug use, I guess I would feel kinda cheated maybe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, because feeling that I -- I'm getting paid the same as they are, and yet, you know, I'm doing my best and they're not able to do what they should do.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know and yet -- and yet st- -- they still get paid the same --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so I -- I guess I'm not, in that respect, maybe, um, I think it's a good idea just so that [MN] coworkers aren't responsible for reporting each other [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I -- I -- I think that the problem I had maybe was that it was done only, um, during the initial hiring process --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and there was never any, you know, other drug testing --
L:  Nev- -- not any other retests?
R:  Right, there were --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I mean, I know there were people there who would -- I mean, people would come to work intoxicated, so -- you know [LAUGH], not on a regular basis, but it happened --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- and I know that there -- I mean, I was working with a lot of other young people and I thought, you know, people know how to fly, you know, through these drug tests --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they know how to cheat the system and they would come to the -- on the job.  And I know, I spent a lot of time with these people outside of work and I knew what kind of things they did --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I always thought that it was just kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- silly that it was done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just at the hiring process, so that, you know, the company would think, "Oh, we're weeding out the bad people" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but then, it was never, ever an issue again, so --
L:  [NOISE] And I, yeah, I think it should be a consistent, um, practice, I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  I thi- -- I think that would be a much better, um, way to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I think you're right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, as an employer, I -- I guess I feel that I sh- -- I should have the right to do it, to maintain a safe workplace.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, [MN] the company that we have is [SIGH] a manufacturing company and [SIGH], um, it is just so -- I -- I just -- I feel really strongly, I guess, about providing safety --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- um, providing a safe environment, and, um, there have been instances where, if we had had a drug program in place at the time, I feel that it could have prevented some things that happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and it -- it would have been, um, would -- it would have been easier, I think, in, ah, employee relations, if -- if we'd had a drug testing program in place.  Um --
R:  Do you have incidents -- are you thinking of incidents where people have had to report others, or ...?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, yeah, ther- -- well, that's one, um, and then there are a couple of others where, uh, equipment operation was involved --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and some very near misses for, ah, seriousness.  Um, and it's just -- [MN] I just feel that safety is more important than, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I guess, what, um -- even -- even though a person feels that it -- you know, they have a personal right to use, um, any type of drug, that when it affects others, um, and when it affects, uh, someone else's property, that, um, it's not right, um.  [LIPSMACK] I think that they should respect others more than that.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think too that it -- I mean, it almost depends on whether or not you're dealing with someone who maybe just smokes pot, maybe like once a month, or someone who has, like, a full blown addiction --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to methamphetamines, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  There's -- there's a big difference, and I think that, you know, I don't pa- -- I don't use pot, but I -- I think that, you know, if that's what you're testing for, I mean, if -- if that were to come across in a -- a drug test, I don't -- I think that there's a -- there should be different lines of maybe --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- discipline or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- action taken, you know.  'Cause I -- I just think there's -- drugs are so different, and even though I don't think that any of them are particularly good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that some, I mean -- I mean, I think every drug affects you, but I think that somebody --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- who just maybe, you know, does it, you know, maybe once a month or twice a year, you know --
L:  I think it has less effect on them, yeah.
R:  Ex- exactly, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I do.  And -- and you're right, and I do think that there should be varying, I guess, um, [LIPSMACK], there [MN], if there was, um, testing that could say, you know, "The concentration is, you know, this percentage, then your, um, discipline would be, you know, this.  You know, if it's a, you know, greater percentage, then the discipline is much greater", you know [LAUGH]?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  It'd be -- yeah, I think it -- it would make it more fair.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I do. [NOISE] So, um, and I think that, um, alcohol should be treated in the same manner, I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] Because [MN] it definitely, uh, has an effect on a person's --
R:  Oh, definitely --
L:  -- um, performance [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Definitely [LAUGH].  I -- I've had weird experiences because the one job I went to where there was just the initial drug testing, people would come to work occasionally intoxicated.  But I worked at another job in the entertainment industry, and there were people literally in the parking lot doing drugs --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like -- like cocaine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was -- it was kind of just an accepted thing [LAUGH] where --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, even managers were out there participating.  And I thought, "This is so bizarre", but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess because we weren't doing anything particularly life threatening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we were just putting out a -- a newspaper, an, uh, entertainment newspaper, I thought -- I guess, maybe they thought, "Well, you know, we're not gonna hurt anybody if we're high while doing it" but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It certainly made for a very strange workplace [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that would, I don't know --
R:  -- to know that it was happening.
L:  -- how effective, I guess, you'd be at the job, or how -- you know, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because it wasn't even -- it wasn't, like, recreational use, where people would just talk about what they did on the weekends, they would just --
L:  No, that's --
R:  -- go out and do it right there [LAUGH] during their lunch hour --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and sometimes not even during a break [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] So, that was a little strange.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that would be. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't seen that yet, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, not many people do [LAUGH].  I work at another company in LA, and I tell people that story, and they're just thinking, "Wow, that's even weird for out here" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but, yeah, I -- I mean, I ha- have seen, I guess --
