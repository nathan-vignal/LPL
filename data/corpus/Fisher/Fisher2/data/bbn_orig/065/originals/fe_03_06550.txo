L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, how are you?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm good.  My name's Trish.
R:  Hello, Trish, I'm Diane [MN].
L:  Hi, Diane [LAUGH].  Are you from England?
R:  Uh, yeah.  Well, England via New Zealand.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  I -- I get that all the time.  But, yeah, no, it --
L:  Do --
R:  -- I am English, but I lived in New Zealand.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, your whole life?
R:  Uh, in New Zealand?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, about half half.  
L:  About what?
R:  About half in New Zealand --
L:  Oh, o- --
R:  -- and half in England, yeah.
L:  Where in England?
R:  In London.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I -- I've been there, like, four times this year.
R:  Okay.  Wh- where, um --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- where are you calling from?
L:  Wh -- I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm -- I'm in New York.  
L:  You're in New York [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, wow.  How'd you find out about this study?
R:  Um, I'm a mystery shopper.
L:  Oh, okay, cool.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And --
L:  Um, so what are we supposed to be talking about?  Drug testing? 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] What do you think about it?
R:  Um, well, as I don't take drugs, um, I have no problem with it.
L:  Right [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Pretty much I'm the same way.
R:  U- um [NOISE], better get away from that.  Um, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no, I --I really have no problem with it.  Um, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- would have -- I think if you go and work for a company, and they tell you at the outset that this is part of their procedure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they do random drug testing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't see why not.
L:  Right.  Right, I agree.
R:  You know, I mean, if -- if you sign on -- I mean if you -- if you're working for a company and they announce it out of the blue --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, I think that's not on.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it's the same with, uh [LIPSMACK], airport screening and -- you know, where they go through your bags and all the rest of it.
L:  Yes.
R:  I've -- I've got no problem with that either.
L:  No, 'cause you got --
R:  For --
L:  -- nothing to hide, then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's the problem?  Right.
R:  Um, I mean, I'm no goodie two shoes.  I mean, I -- I like a drink --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- every now and again, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, but I wouldn't get in my car and drive.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, um, because I think that's the responsible thing to do.  Um, I have been known, on occasion, to go out and sort of think, "No, I'll grab a cab home and pick the car up in the morning".
L:  Yes, I've done that.
R:  [MN] It's a -- [MN] you know, and I mean, you know, it's -- it's -- I mean, having said I have the odd drink, I mean I'm [LAUGH] -- you know, I don't get crazy, but [MN] you just sort of think [MN], "No, probably not a good idea" if --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, you know, I won't do it, and of course you go back the next day.  And then you've got to get in to work the next day [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know, and -- and the overnight parking, but it -- it's an awful lot cheaper than, um, [MN] --
L:  Getting arrested or killing someone.
R:  -- yeah, getting done and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- losing your licence and -- and all the rest of it, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, I'm actually a lawyer by trade, but I can't practise here yet.
L:  You're a what -- a lawyer?
R:  A lawyer, yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Um, but, um --
L:  You have to take the bar in the States, or like in New York or ...?
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Well, I mean, our law is based on, um, English -- you know, sort of British law.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and New Zealand is -- is the same, so that's not a problem, but here, um, state to state everything's different.  You know, and then you've got your federal law and your tort law and [MN], um, it's all quite crazy.  So, at the moment, I'm sort of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing all sorts of little bits and pieces while I hit the books [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I could barely hear you.  So, you're studying up right now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Good.  Mm.
R:  Yeah, so, you know, I -- I'm not even sure what the legal standpoint on drug testing is.  But [MN] --
L:  I don't know either.  I really don't know.  My company, um, on the application --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it says that they can do it at any time.  Um, but they never do, so --
R:  [MN] I --
L:  -- I think it's there just to protect, um, if they wanna fire someone [LAUGH].  You know?
R:  Look, I -- I think it's more, um, it's there more as a deterrent, you know, so people think, "Oh, gosh, well, you know, maybe they might", but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wh- -- I mean, why would you if you didn't have any reason to?  I mean, people [MN] -- actually, that's a stupid thing to say, because [LAUGH] I was going to say, people have enough to do.  But some companies seem to really enjoy, um, [LIPSMACK] doing anything [LAUGH] just to make paperwork.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know?
L:  And then -- well, I think with my company, if they had a problem with someone, then they could drug test them and maybe find they were on drugs and then get rid of 'em, you know?
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  It would be a way to get rid of some -- 'cause in California, it's really hard to fire people.  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] People keep saying that, anywhere, that it's hard to fire people --
L:  It's not like England [LAUGH].  In England --
R:  Um --
L:  -- my friends lose jobs left and right.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But [SIGH] -- well, a couple of them do, yeah.  But they're crazy --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but [LAUGH] --
R:  What does that say about you? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, a little bit.  But that's why I like to go over there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, if I go over there, then I can go out and take the Tube home or take the night bus home or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know?  Here, it's impossible.  You can't -- you can never get a little bit out of control at all, so -- you can't, you gotta drive everywhere.
R:  'Cause I -- I mean wh- where I'm living at the moment, um, it's quite -- [MN] I'm in New York, but it's quite rural --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] and [MN] I have been offered so much work, [LAUGH] I'm actually now president of the, um, Chamber of Commerce for the area.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, except I don't know that much about the area [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's how easy it is to get work here [LAUGH].
L:  I kn- -- it is.  Pretty much, I know.  And supposedly we have, like, a huge unemployment, but it's a lot easier here, I think, than it is -- is -- it is in England.  I don't know [SIGH], huh, I don't know.
R:  I -- I --
L:  Things are --
R:  Hm, I -- I don't know.  I mean [SIGH], I do -- a- as I say, at the moment, because I'm rural, um, and because I'm sort of, you know, doing my -- my exams and things --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, I'm wanting stuff that gives me a bit of money but is also extremely flexible.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Um, which is why I do the mystery shopping and the merchandising.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I mean, one of the companies I do, they, um, pay me eighteen dollars to go in and change the batteries in a musical display.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Which I can't quite understand why the people in the -- in the store just don't do it, but they pay me eighteen dollars and it's two minutes from my house, [MN] so I go and --
L:  And you get it done.
R:  And, uh, [LAUGH] so I go and do it.  But they have a, um, policy too, on, um, alcohol and drugs and all the rest of it.  I mean, when -- when I joined with them, as I say, I only do, um -- I'm an independent contractor --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and by the time I filled out the w nine and the this and the that and the independent contractor agreement and the -- I agree to, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- random drug testing and all the rest of it, I thought [MN], "What am I doing here?  This is crazy".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, yeah.  I think -- I think that might be one reason why though.  It's very hard to fire people, you know.  I think it's --
R:  But they can't -- they can't fire me anyway, because I -- I'm not an employee, I'm an independent contractor.
L:  Mm.  Exactly.
R:  I'm -- s- s- so go figure that one.
L:  Yeah, so that doesn't make much sense, 'cause then they -- they don't have to call you --
R:  I mean, th- -- yeah, all they say is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- "We -- we've got no work" --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  -- or, you know, "We've got no work for you".  They don't even have to say, "We have no work", you know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah, that is kinda strange [MN].
R:  But, um, I -- I [MN] -- this -- this is a country that just loves its legalese, you know.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you -- you trip over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something in a store and you sue for a million dollars [LAUGH], you know.
L:  Yeah, it's true.
R:  Um, I mean, we don't -- we don't have that.  That would just be -- well, it wouldn't even get to court, you know?  Um ...
L:  Well, what do you think of that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Crazy.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, a- absolutely crazy.  I mean, you know, there's the guy who's suing McDonald's 'cause he's overweight or something and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [MN] I ca- -- i- it's -- it just is -- is mind boggling to me.  Um, mind you, I've never done -- I don't like litigation anyway.  I -- I sort of specialize in, um, criminal defence [SIGH] which is a little ... yeah, you've got your friends and I've got mine [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  That's a little wacky, you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- but I guess -- mind you, that's how -- that's why I'm here, because, um, I met my husband at a conference in, funnily enough, in LA.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  In California.  And he's a forensic psychologist.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, yeah [LAUGH], so I met him and he lives [NOISE] here, so this is where we ended up.
L:  Wow.  And now you're finding your way around, yeah, our system.
R:  Oh, look, I'm still not even legal to drive at the moment.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That is so scary.  Forty two years old --
L:  [LAUGH]
