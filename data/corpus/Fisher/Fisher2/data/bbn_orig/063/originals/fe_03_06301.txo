R:  Stephanie[?].
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, my name is Eve, what's yours?
R:  Stephanie.
L:  Stephanie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, nice to meet you, Stephanie.
R:  Nice to meet you too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're to talk about hobbies.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What are your hobbies?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Well, um -- okay, I spend a lot of time on the computer and I'm, ah -- ah, I like to ride my bike --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um -- yeah, there's tripping, I like to dance .
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, what -- um, [MN] what are your hobbies?
R:  [MN] Oh, let's see. [SIGH] I like going to the gym. [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I like movies.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I like to read and I like to knit.
L:  Oh, okay.  Kind of solitary -- um -- or -- well, the -- the knitting and the -- the reading are quiet activities.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I never thought of that, yeah.
L:  That -- that -- but they're -- they're -- and in -- and I like movies as well.  I like to go to the movies. [MN] So, um, [several inaudible words] ah other things like how do you think people get hobbies or something like that, but I don't --
R:  It's sort of how -- it asked, "How many hours per week we devote to our hobbies?" or something like that.  I -- I have no idea -- and that --
L:  Oh, is that what it said?
R:  Yeah and then it said, "Do you think that, um, every person should have at least one hobby?". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Um [LAUGH] -- well, the latter is kind of easy to answer. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think everyone should have at least one interest.  I can't imagine someone not having any interests.  So, I think that yeah, everybody should have a hobby or two.
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, otherwise you'd just be working and I don't know what else you'd do.
R:  Sleeping.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] sleeping and eating.
R:  [LAUGH] But for some people sleeping is a hobby.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I've known people -- I've known people who say that sleeping is one of their main hobbies.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I- it's very strange. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is really strange. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what do -- wa- wait, what was the other one now?  The -- oh, how did --
R:  How many hours a week do you devote to your hobbies?
L:  Oh, okay.  How -- how many hours a week do you devote to your hobbies?
R:  Ah, I would say probably five or six hours going to the gym a week.
L:  Wow, you must be in great shape.
R:  I'm not really. [LAUGH] You would think that I am but I'm actually -- I -- I don't think I -- I mean, I think I am like in shape, but I don't think I look like I'm in shape.  You know, I don't look like a -- a marathon runner or anything like that.
L:  Oh, right.  Right.  Well, it's -- it's all genes I -- I guess --
R:  Yeah, that's very true.  I just have a huge ho- -- a huge pot belly, so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's totally genetic though, because my mother has one and my sister has one, so.
L:  Right.  Definitely.
R:  It -- it's -- no exercise will make that go away, no matter how many, ah, crunches you do, it's still going to be there, so.
L:  Definitely.
R:  But yeah, I do probably about five hours at the gym.  Knitting I only do maybe like an hour a week, because that is -- it is really solitary, so it gets kind of boring.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And unless I'm working on a project it's -- you know, it's just honestly something to pass the time if I'm by myself and bored, but mm.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And movies I would say a couple of hours a week.  It depends.
L:  Oh, do you re- -- like renting videos and going to the theatre or ...?
R:  Yeah, both. [LAUGH] But going to the movies can be expensive, so.
L:  Yeah, it is expensive.
R:  I only do that a couple of times a month, so.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I -- me too, I only do that like a couple of times a month.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, oh yeah, did you -- what movies have you seen recently?
R:  Um -- 
L:  I think that's off the subject but --
R:  Oh, who cares. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I just -- I'm curious.
R:  I think they just -- I think they just care about us talking.  I don't think they care what we talk about.  Um --
L:  Oh, I think you're right.  I think they're -- they're just screening our speech or something.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, what have I seen.  I saw that, ah, Bend It Like Beckham, the soccer movie.
L:  Oh, did you like that?
R:  It was really good.  It was really good.  It -- I thought it would be a little hokey just because it was like, you know, a feel good movie and I usually don't like stuff like that but I thought --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was really good.  It was very good.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I saw -- I saw all the movies that were nominated for like best picture.  I try to do that, it's so hokie but I try to do that.  But I haven't really seen any other movies like in the theatres recently.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, I think I'm going to see X men tomorrow night.
L:  Oh.  Ooh, that was good.
R:  It was good?  I heard it was pretty good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was very good.  I saw it.  I mean, I was really -- I loved it. [MN] And I saw Matrix, the new Matrix.  It was good.
R:  How was that?  I haven't heard really good things about that.
L:  It wasn't as good as the first one.
R:  Right.
L:  It was a little bit more [MN] -- um, like -- it took a lot of the mystique out of the first one but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it was sort of the good mystique about it.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  I heard there were like too many characters or something.  Like the Jada Pinkett Smith character was just kind of like there.  You know, like they were -- they --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- added a bunch of people from the first movie and it was like they didn't really serve any sort of purpose, they were just kind of there, so.
L:  It's true.  It's true, you just made me think of that.  Yeah, because she didn't really -- and then like it ends like on a really like annoying cliff hanger.  Like -- not like, you know, you'll see if see if.  It sort of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just ends, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  --  in the -- in the middle of -- you know?  And it very much sets up the next thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but -- but in an unsatisfying -- very unsatisfying way.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you said you like dancing, what kind of dancing do you do?  Do you do like salsa dancing or something or ...?
L:  Um, no I do -- ah, I -- I g- -- I go to -- ah, I like to dance to house music.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Mm, can -- I -- I go -- I go dancing every week, like the same place [LAUGH] every week.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's just, um -- you know, all I do is dance the whole time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just go in there and I start dancing at about ten PM and dance till two AM [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then leave.
R:  Oh, my God. [LAUGH] Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, maybe I'll stop for like fifteen minutes to like have cranberry juice or something --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but then I just go back --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but -- but it's fun.  I love it.  I love it. [LAUGH] But -- um, where are you from?
R:  Ah, I'm from LA.
L:  Oh, you're from LA too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm from LA.  So, [several inaudible words] that's interesting that we have two LA people talking to each other.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I talked to somebody from -- um, I think he was from Nebraska the other day.  This is my second time calling, but the first time I had to talk to someone from Nebraska.
L:  Oh, interesting.  This is my first time calling.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, my first time was really -- we had to talk about computer games, which is something I know absolutely [LAUGH] nothing about [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my [LAUGH] --
R:  -- and he was -- he was really -- he was really anti computer games.  He was like --
L:  Oh, anti?
R:  "I don't understand ..." -- he was like, "I don't understand people whose -- who waste their money on computer games" and I was like, "Wow, you really ..." [LAUGH].  He was really upset about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I was just kind of like, "I don't think we're supposed to get that passionate about what we're [LAUGH] talking about.  But he was really, you know, against --"
L:  Wow.
R:  -- spending money on computer games.
L:  Wow.  Wow, that's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well -- and then you didn't anything, so it's kind of like really -- ah, it sounds a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of a negative conversation [several inaudible words] --
R:  I was just kind of like, "Well, my fiance -- like he plays computer games, but I don't really try to get involved in that" [LAUGH] you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, he wa- -- he -- at the end of the conversation, he goes, "Tell your boyfriend to stop playing so many computer games" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] and I go, "Okay". [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] I'll do that, right away. [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, did you find out about this through the LA Weekly or ...?
L:  I found out about it through Craig's List because --
R:  Oh, yeah!  That's right, it was on Craig's List.  I remember seeing that.
L:  And someone who was trying to get like the referrals, you know, like they're -- they're -- they're putting out on Craig's List and then they're -- then they're sending you the link to it, but with their reference number so they make money off it.
R:  Yeah, I heard if you refer a -- like a -- a-- a male participant, you'll get a dollar per guy or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  That -- so, that person really had a good idea to put it on Craig's List [LAUGH] because --
R:  Yeah, I know, because lot of people go on there --
L:  How are you going to -- yeah, probably get like a hundred -- hello?
R:  Probably.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought it was going to end soon.
R:  No.
L:  Hello?  Oh, okay.
R:  No, they come on and the wom- -- the same woman from before will come on and say, "Your ten minutes is up" or something like that.
L:  [LAUGH]  You did a very good imitation of her.
R:  Thank you. [LAUGH]
L:  "Your ten minutes is up" or something. [LAUGH] Actually, I thought, because the way that you talk I was thinking, "Oh, she's from LA" you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because sh- -- there's a -- but you're probably not necessarily born here but --
R:  No.  No, I
