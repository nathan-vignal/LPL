L:  My name is Yvonne.
R:  My name is Mark.
L:  Oh.  Hi, Mark.
R:  Hi, Yvonne.
L:  Nice to meet you.  How you doing today?
R:  I'm doing pretty good, thank you.
L:  Oh, that's good.  Um --
R:  So, I guess we're supposed to discuss this topic --
L:  About smoking.
R:  -- between us.  Is that the way this works?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Well --
L:  What --
R:  -- I --
L:  -- do you --
R:  I'm not a s- -- I'm a non smoker and --
L:  I'm a non smoker also.
R:  -- and I don't like being around people who smoke, and secondary smoke.  And so, I actually think the ban is a good thing.  And I, um -- there might be a -- a lot who feel there's an impingement of personal rights, but I think --
L:  I do too.
R:  -- there's health issues there.  And -- and, um -- but, ah, so -- but, I think, you know, there are health issues in smoking, so I think, ah, ad campaigns and other things out to make people aware of -- of the -- the health issues involved and the --
L:  That's so true.
R:  I think those are good things, so --
L:  That's true, because smoking -- I have friends that smoke.  And now, um, I have a very close friend -- and, you know, I don't wanna hurt her feelings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but when I go to her house -- she's confined to a wheelchair now.
R:  Mhm
L:  And when I go in her house we open the door -- the smoke just -- you can see it.  It just pours out.  And when I leave it's all in my clothes, it's in my hair.  And then when I come home my dad says, "Where have you been?" you know, 'cause you can smell the smoke.
R:  Oh, it clings 
L:  And then --
R:  -- to you.  
L:  --like you said, the second hand smoker -- it's bad for them, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they don't smoke, but for them --
R:  I think it's --
L:  -- to bre- --
R:  -- difficult for somebody who's been doing it all their life to give it up.  But, ah --
L:  Right.
L:  -- I think one of the -- the -- da- -- you know, the other thing is sort of a lot of the ads should be targeted at the younger generation too, so they don't start.
L:  That's right.  The --
R:  And, ah --
L:  Because children see what you do and then they, you know, take it upon themselves -- you know, and they -- you know, they just more or less see and do -- they [MN] -- well, like their friends.  If their friends smoke, and if other friends tell 'em, "Oh, you square", you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then they try to -- to fit in.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, they try to smoke.
R:  Right.
L:  But, it's -- it is -- it's really not good.
R:  No, it's not healthy.  And -- and it's not good for the people around you.  And, you know, I -- ah, I do a lot of overseas travel, in a lot -- lot of countries where, you know, they don't have anti smoking campaigns, and people smoke in airports and restaurants.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we get spoilt over here.  I'm used to now being around areas where it's prohibited, and to go to some of these areas where they do do a --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- lot of smoking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's -- it's --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- hard to -- hard to take at times.  So --
L:  And you can breathe better.
R:  Oh, you can breathe better. 
L:  It is -- it --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- like, takes your breath away.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  I don't --
R:  So, I -- I'm all for, ah, aggressive ad campaigns, ah, particularly directed at younger -- younger people that, ah --
L:  that's right.
R:  -- tell you about the evils of smoking.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  I --
R: -- ah --
L:  -- am too.  And it's not good for pregnant women.  And, you know, has -- it's just not good.  
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  And my dad quit when I was a child, and I'm so glad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm so glad.
R:  Yeah.  I think if you're -- I guess if -- you know, if you're smoking in -- in your own house and you don't have kids around and -- that -- that's one thing.  But I think in public places I -- I'm -- I'm a firm believer that smoking should be illegal in public places.
L:  It is.  It -- it --
R:  Because if you're --
L:  -- should be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they have a lot of  -- just like, ah, restaurants.  You know, they'll ask you, "A smoking area or a non smoking area?" but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- still that smoke goes --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- through the building.
R:  I mean, yeah, it -- ah, I try to even stay away from those areas too, so -- but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah -- and luckily on airplanes now it's -- and at least in this country -- smoking is prohibited.  Because I've been on some foreign flights where they allow you to smoke in the back of the plane, but that doesn't do any good 'cause the smoke drifts to the front, into the --
L:  That's --
R:  -- nonsmoking 
L:  -- true.
R:  area.  
L:  That's true.
R:  So -- so --
L:  And it --it's just not good.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  It is not.  And I'm for it 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I really am.
R:  But the, ah, tobacco lobby is pretty powerful too, so they're, um --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they've got a --
L:  But, they have it on the cigarettes [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that [NOISE] it's a hazard. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, [NOISE] the American -- you know the general -- [NOISE] association [NOISE] --
R:  Mm.
L:  They tell them but, you know, like you said, a lot of people have smoked so long.  And then there are some older people have said -- well, their parents smoked, or they used tobaccos or, you know, the real older ones, they dipped[?] snuff.  It didn't bother them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I believe now that tobacco is not like, you know, back then.  I don't know --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- if they've added chemicals or what to it, but it's not the same.  Nothing's the same.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  And that it's gonna harm you.
R:  Yeah.  I know there's a lot of criticism that, ah, the, ah, tobacco industry -- saying that th- they do add, ah, you know, addictive chemicals to it so you get hooked on it now.  And -- and, ah --
L:  Right.  So you can keep patronizing with them and keep buying cigarettes.  And cigarettes are so expensive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The price of cigarettes -- you could put that money in your car for gasoline.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  It's a shame --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- how high --
R:   -- may be -- maybe they should be expensive as a deterrent, and makes it harder for at least kids to buy, you know.  But, ah --
L:  Now, [MN] do you remember when they, ah, raised the age limit?
R:  For smoking?
L:  For -- ah, for children to -- to, ah, buy cigarettes.
R:  Oh, I don't remember.  I -- and I never smoked.  I've never smoked a cigarette, so I don't, ah --
L:  Oh yes.
R:  -- never paid any attention. But, ah --
L:  When I was real young and -- I was in my teens -- I tried to smoke.  Oh, but I still -- I would -- they said you're supposed to swallow the smoke.  I never did that.  You make the smoke come out your nose.
R:  Oh.
L:  I didn't know how to do that.  I'd, like, choke to death.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I puffed and just blew it out of my mouth.  But, I would take my hand, and you know how you fan the smoke -- so, I could never stand it, so I just stopped.  I just, you know --
R:  You were able to stop on your own then, huh?
L:  Yeah, I just -- and then, I -- I tried Benson and Hedges menthol. [LIPSMACK]  It made me cough and cough and cough and cough.  I said, "Anything make you act like this and feel like this, what good is it?  I don't need this".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I just stopped.  But, I was, you know -- like, I -- that's why I said I know children will try to fit in.  I was -- they were smoking so I got a cigarette too.  I didn't --
R:  So, you --
L:  -- know --
R:  -- smoked for a number of years then, huh?
L:  No -- no.  I didn't s- -- I didn't.  I -- I tried --
R:  You tried it?
L:  -- when I was in my twenties.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  When I -- my late teens and my early twenties.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, it -- that -- it -- it didn't work.  I c- couldn't stand the smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L: Yeah, I couldn't stand the smoke at all.
R:  Well, that's good -- that's --
L:  It bothered --
R:  -- good.
L:  -- my eyes.  I -- I couldn't breathe.  And when I would puff off the cigarette then I would move away from the smoke.  Ah, that's not a smoker. [LAUGH]  So --
R:  So, you -- you never got addicted to cigarettes?
L:  I -- oh no, I never got --
R:  That's --
L:   -- addicted to it.
R:  -- good.
L:  I -- I --
R:  That's --
L:  -- couldn't --
R:  -- good.
L:  -- stand it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, I just -- I don't still like it.
R:  But, you say your mother smokes.  Or --
L:  No. My --
R:  -- is that --
L:  -- mother --
R:  -- your grandmother?
L:  -- my mother never did smoke.
R:  It's your grandmother you were talking about that's in -- that's in a -- wheel bound --
L:  Ah, no.
R:  -- chair?  In a -- wheelchair --
L:  She's --
R:  -- bound.
L:  A very good friend of mine.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  She's -- we're very good friends.  But, she's like a -- a god sister.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And she chain smokes.  Her name is May, and she chain smokes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the doctor already told her to quit smoking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she won't stop.  And I say, "Well, May, if you just -- just, you know, maybe, like, today --" like, she'll smoke a pack, and then she'll -- I said, "Look, when you smo- -- okay, you're smoking, like, two or three packs a day, then try two packs.  You know, just kind of wean yourself".  She said, "But I get nervous and then I need the cigarette".  I said, "Well, eat a piece of candy".  You know, I'm trying to help her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, I don't know if the patch will help her.  I --
R:  The patches?
L:  -- don't know.  They have the --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- the patches --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now.
R:  Yeah. [MN] 
L:  So --
R:  Those --
L:  But, she --
R:  -- evidently do work, but I -- you know, I don't know much about 'em.
L:  What happened -- she could walk around, like I could, and she had back surgery.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Something went wrong with the surgery and the doctor nicked her spine.  And so, now she's in a wheelchair, and she's -- she's depressed.  She's very depressed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, she just sits there and just smoke -- smoke -- smoke -- smoke -- smoke.  And I told her, "It's not good for you".
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  She had slowed down a lot but then, since this has happened, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she smokes even faster.
R:  Yeah.  Well, hopefully that, ah -- hopefully she'll still l- live a long good, you know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- fruitful life.  And -- and, ah --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- although I think she's -- by smoking she's probably taking a few years off it, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know. 
L:  'Cause --
R:  But --
L:  -- she has a lot of health problems now --
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  -- from --
R:  -- some people, you know -- I think they're -- again, you get addicted to it and you -- you don't think of the health -- health issues involved --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  And then other people around 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then she said, "Well, you don't come and visit me like you used to", but we talk on the phone every day.  And I said, "Well, for one thing", I said, "The smoke bothers me".  "But I'll stop", she said, "I won't smoke".  I said, "But it's all in the house".  You know --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it's everywhere.
R:  Did you say she has other family members in the house?
L:  N- no.  She has her [inaudible] provider that stays there with her.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And her provider smokes too.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So, they --
R:  That doesn't help.
L:  -- smoke together.  It's double smoke.
R:  Yeah, that certainly doesn't help.
L:  So, her provider does -- the lady that she had, she's gone out of town.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she has another provider, but she doesn't stay there.  But, her mother is there, and she's up in [inaudible], and she does not smoke.  She's a diabetic.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And, um, that's not good for her --
R:  No.
L:  --'cause she's up in [inaudible] and she's inhaling all that smoke.
R:  Oh no -- 
L:  And it's not --
R:  -- no, not at all. 
L:  That's --
R:  So -- 
L:  -- not good.
R:  Well, I'm lucky I -- my parents never smoked, so I didn't grow up around it.  So -- my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- dad used to smoke cigars once in a while, but my mom hated that.  But, ah --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- never had put up with it too much, so --
L:  You had a strong --
