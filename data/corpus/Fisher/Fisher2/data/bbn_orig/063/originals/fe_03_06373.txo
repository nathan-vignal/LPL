L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.
R:  Hello, I'm Sondra.
L:  Oh, I'm Cheryl, from Kansas City.
R:  Nice to meet you, Cheryl.  I'm from Nashville, Tennessee.
L:  Oh, okay, nice to meet you.  Um, well, do you want to start or you want me to or ...?
R:  Um, I haven't done this before, how about if you start?
L:  Okay.  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, I don't smoke and I, um, am kind of glad if they could, um, um, do away with it in public places because I don't like to be around smokers very much and I definitely think it's bad for your health.
R:  I agree.  I am an occasional smoker, um --
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  -- mostly when I'm really busy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or when I'm being social, um, around other smokers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And there are certain places where smoking would be acceptable publically, say, like, a bar where smoking is allowed.
L:  Right.
R:  Or things like that.  But in the majority of public places I -- I really don't like it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I probably smoke maybe five cigarettes a month --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and the rest of the time I really don't [LAUGH] want to be around it, which is hypocritical but so be it.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I guess I don't -- I think I, um ... I -- uh, uh, my father in law just died of, um, lung cancer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so it makes me even more --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know, adamant that I'm against cigarettes, I guess, and --
R:  Yeah, there's -- there's no good way --
L:  'Cause he smoked all his life.
R:  -- to kill yourself on purpose. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  And it -- um, and then, you know, once he realized he had it he quit smoking but it was too late at that point.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- and then I -- I truly, when I, like, um, [LIPSMACK] am in a restaurant or something that -- somebody around me is smoking it just -- I don't like it.  You know, I don't like it to get in my food and [LAUGH] and --
R:  Yeah, it's really not a pleasant odor, and --
L:  I -- it isn't, it isn't.
R:  It -- it's -- it's horrible.  My fiance smokes, um, on a r- -- daily basis.  He smokes --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- like, a pack and a half a week or more, I don't know.  He doesn't tell me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I don't really like it a whole lot.  And he smokes outside of the home because I don't want the smell.
L:  Oh, it -- I know, I know.
R:  Which makes me even more of a hypocrite. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well actually, I mean, it wouldn't be that bad if wasn't the smell, you know, it just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it hangs in the air and then it gets in your clothes and --
R:  In your hair.
L:  -- in your hair and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, and I don't like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, when -- whenever we go out to see a band play or something in town here, we come home and I have to take a shower.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I make him take a shower because we both smell so much of smoke and we wake up in the morning and then it's just disgusting.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  But --
L:  I know.
R:  Let's see, what was -- what was the other question about the ads?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, the smoking prevention, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  I -- I think there are a lot of really good ads out there, um, designed to educate the general public --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- against smoking.  I like the red curtain ads a lot.
L:  Se- -- now, see, I haven't even probably seen those.
R:  Right.
L:  I probably j- -- if I have seen 'em, I just tune it out because I've known for so long that smoking is bad for you and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that i- if I ha- -- like I said, if I've seen 'em I d- -- I don't even notice any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, but there -- are those ads, those red curtain, are those something on TV, commercials?
R:  They're -- they're on TV, um, usually on the local channels, I guess.  I've ... um, don't really watch a whole lot of TV but, um, they're really educational, they -- they do little bits from, like, courts or from, you know, something like that, somebody'll -- will read it and then they'll pull the curtain aside and say, "Now everybody knows".  And it's -- it's kind of cute.  They're targeted --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- toward, uh, you know, twenty something audience.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  The -- I guess the audience that is increasing in use, so ...  That's nice that they're -- they're using research to actually focus on that group and -- and stuff like that.
L:  That's true, 'cause I do know -- um, my husband has older brothers and so they have kids that are, like, twenty or so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] all of 'em smoke now, and I didn't even know it and we showed up at, um, [LIPSMACK] a, um, birthday party and they were all outside smoking and -- and I -- so I think that is a good target group to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to have.
R:  It's the, um ... and it doesn't seem like young teens are smoking so much and definitely, you know, my parents' generation and my grandparents' generation have ceased doing so.
L:  Right.
R:  In -- in large numbers.
L:  Right.
R:  But the, um ... but club goers these days, it's kind of a communicable disease. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  Oh, I know.  Well, when I was in college I'm sure that I did a couple of times, you know, but I don't -- it's nothing I picked up, thank heavens, I have enough bad habits. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, those are easy to pick up.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and I d- -- I have friends that smoke and, I mean, it doesn't bothe- -- I just, you know, I just worry about their health down the road because for a long time you're fine and then later you start getting that smoker's cough and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I guess it just ke- -- I mean, not being able to breathe is --
R:  It makes you more prone to asthma and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all kinds of other things.
L:  Breathing pro- -- and I just can't imagine not being able to breathe very well, you know? [LAUGH] But --
R:  It's hard enough with all the other pollutants that --
L:  Right, [LAUGH] I agree.
R:  I don't know, I still think it's a -- it's a matter of choice, though, in a lot of ways.  I like the educational programs and advertisements that are out there because it makes the public more knowledgeable about what they're doing.  "If you choose to do this, this it wh- what's going to happen to you".
L:  Gonna happen, the true --
R:  "So choose wisely and" --
L:  Right.
R:  I think that's one of the reasons why even if I'm going to be really busy I probably only smoke, like, one cigarette in a week --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or, you know, if I have just a massive deadline and there's a lot of pressure I might, you know, step out for a cigarette with someone a couple of times a day.  But I'm not really interested in, you know, going out and buying a pack of cigarettes and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- smoking all the cigarettes 'cause, one, they make you feel a little bit nauseous [LAUGH] --
L:  Really?
R:  -- if you don't smoke all the time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, two, it just -- it tastes nasty, it smells nasty.  But every once in a while you just kind of want that relief, I guess.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh --
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] also they're expensive too any more.
R:  They are.
L:  I mean, I know we're not supposed to get off on that subject [LAUGH] but they are expen- --
R:  I remember when I was in school they probably cost, like, a dollar and some change, if that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and those were, like, the good cigarettes. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  And what --
R:  And --
L:  How much is it no- --
R:  I think the last time my fiance bought cigarettes they were over three dollars.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  That's a lot.
R:  Which is -- I mean, it's been a few years, it's been, you know, ten years since I started college but, uh, that's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of increase in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ten years.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  It's just amazing.
L:  I know.  Now, what was the other question we were supposed -- was that everything?  Just the ads and --
R:  I think so.  It was whether or not smoking should be allowed in public places and then whether or not advertisements and things like that were a good idea.
L:  Okay.
R:  Something like that.
L:  And I do think they're successful in getting the message out.  I mean --
R:  I think so.
L:  I think it --
R:  There are so many messages, though, I wonder if they get confused, like you said, tuning them out.
L:  Tha- -- well, that's true, that's true.  But you have to know.  I mean, there are so many messages that you have to know that it's bad for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I don't think anybody who smokes a cigarette today doesn't realize that it -- you know, the chances you're taking with your health.
R:  I would hope not.  I mean, unless you're burying your head in the sand --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you have to know.  There are people constantly telling you.  I mean, school children go up to their parents and say, "You're not supposed to do that". [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So how can they be oblivious?
L:  And even on the ads themselves, like, you know, I read People magazine [LAUGH] and there's big -- you know, even on the smoking ads there's big warnings right there, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that this isn't good for you, or it can cause lung cancer and blah, blah, blah, so ...
R:  Yeah.  And, plus, there are the law suits that people have won --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which, you know, even to the most obstinate ostrich should prove something, that, you know, these people are liable for endangering, you know, people's health without letting them know.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Right, they have won a lot of money over that, you're right.
R:  Yeah.  I wonder how much of it they've actually gotten.
L:  Gotten, I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's like, how many appeals do they have to go through before they actually, you know, get to fund their own research study or, you know, health prevention foundation or something like that.  I'm sure some of these ads are generated by money from law suits.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  You know, though, when I do feel somewhat bad is that -- like, I was just a graduation thing this weekend and this one lady smoked and she was outside by herself smoking, you know, and it does --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- seem like it's gotten that way, where, you know, if you wanna smoke, get away from everybody else, you know, kind of thing.  And I mean --
R:  Well --
L:  -- it is too bad, but ...
R:  And a lot of the people that I'll, you know, have a social cigarette with or something if ... [LIPSMACK] we talk about this, um, about how, you know, it stinks, and I've never heard a person say, you know, "It's -- it's so stupid that I have to come out here" or, you know, "I can't believe those people don't like the smell of my cigarettes".
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, I think it's understood --
L:  -stood, okay.
R:  -- by the people who choose to smoke that, you know, that is their choice, that they've chosen to do that and that other people have chosen not to have that around.
L:  Okay.
R:  So --
