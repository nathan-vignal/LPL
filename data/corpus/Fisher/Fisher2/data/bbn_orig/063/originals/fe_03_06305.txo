L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Catherine[?].
L:  Yes?
R:  And your name is?
L:  Mary Vogt, V.O.G.T.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay.  So, I guess the topic is how do we feel about people ban- -- about them banning smoke in public places.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, I'm not a smoker, are you?
L:  I happen to be, I'm ashamed to admit it but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I am one.  I'm -- you know, it's just so hard to quit but I've cut down quite a bit.  Are you the lady I'm going to be talking to?
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, I've cut down quite a bit, I mean, you know, back from a pack to a half a pack --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I'm still ashamed that I- I'm not quitting.  That nicotine is so bad they say that nicotine is really bad.
R:  It's very addictive.  Well, how do you -- how do you feel about not being able to smoke like say at the shopping centre or the shopping mall?
L:  Well -- what is your name?
R:  Catherine.
L:  Catherine.  Um, a -- as far as the mall itself goes, I mean, um, I usually don't smoke in public any old ways --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- only at home.  But um for personal -- is that -- if a person is that habitual in smoking, I mean, the shopping mall -- the- they shouldn't deprive em of that, you know?  I mean, maybe inside of one of the stores in a mall but you know through the centre part of the store there, you know, I feel that -- I mean [LAUGH] I sh- -- I'm just talking for the public, I'm not talking for myself because I usually don't ha- -- try to have [inaudible] -- I try not to have a cigarette in my hand in public, you know what I mean?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  It's bad enough that I smoke at home.  But other than that, if people, you know, are deprived of that.  I guess they're more hurt than I would be, because like I say, I'm not -- you know, I don't smoke outside anyhow because my -- nobody in -- well, my -- my dad smoked, yeah, he w- -- you know, he smoked cigars and he also smoked a pipe, but my mother never touched a cigarette and she never touched any liquor in her life.  So, she was always against any of us smoking, you know.  We never smoked in front of her, she never seen -- seen even a cigarette in my hand, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, how do you feel about it?
R:  Well, [SIGH] I used to smoke.  I haven't smoked in six years.  My husband quit about four months ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I know that they say second hand smoke is, um, dangerous for other people but I also think that if -- you should have the right to do whatever you want to do, that's why we live in the United States and if you don't want to be around cigarette then don't be around it.  It --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- I mean, you can -- if you don't want somebody to sm- -- if you don't want to sit in a smoking section in a restaurant, go sit in the non smoking.  You know, my husband smoked, I'm glad he quit.  He quit for health reasons, but when he smoked he just smoked and I didn't care.  There wasn't, you know --
L:  Well, when you say, "For the health reasons" did he, by any chance, have emphysema?
R:  No, he has, um, diab- -- he just was diagnosed with diabetes --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so he --
L:  And so was my nephew just couple of months ago.
R:  -- so he --
L:  But he never smoked -- he had that Anders- Andersons disease like that there Pr- President Kennedy had --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but now he found out he got diabetes and, ah, his mother just got it too but he's number -- let's see number one -- number one isn't as bad as numb- -- or am I just the opposite, number two isn't as bad as number one, right?
R:  Right, number two isn't.
L:  So, number one is bad?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very bad.  Now, what does he have?
R:  Number two.
L:  So, that's better yet right?
R:  Yeah, he doesn't have to take, um, needles or anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] But he quit smoking because he -- he also -- well, he quit because of the health reasons, then he realised that -- how he does- -- he says he's felt like [MN] he didn't smell that good and -- and --
L:  Or did you think it -- it also helped out for him to quit smok- -- because he knew that you quit?
R:  No, I quit because um [MN] I got pregnant unexpectedly --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I quit then.
L:  Yeah, but you know what, when I was young and I was pregnant, I was smoking but I never knew that you weren't allowed to smoke.  I only found this out about a week ago to tell you the God's truth.
R:  Really?
L:  I read in a paper and I said, I -- and I'm seventy six years old and I never even heard of that before, you know what I mean?  And they say well -- I -- I know -- I wasn't told, I read it and it said also, it's going to be -- um, the birth will be an early birth --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- premature --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's going to -- and I -- and the weight will be very low.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, if a child is pre born -- premature, naturally they're little --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so sure they're going to be less weight.  Am I right?
R:  Yeah, I would -- maybe it's -- it could also be that -- that, ah, if you smoke, you deprive the baby from oxygen and I guess the baby can't, um, develop --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that could be the reason that they say that too.
L:  That's true too, I never thought of that.  You're right.
R:  Yeah.  But back --
L:  Are you six months pregnant now?
R:  No, I'm not pregnant at all.  I'm forty years old, I'm done with children. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But you -- but you just quit now or years --
R:  No.  No, I quit --
L:  Six yea- --
R:  -- six years ago.
L:  So, how old were you when you started to smoke?
R:  I started smoking when I was thirteen years old.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I smoked from the time I was thirteen until I was thirty four years old.
L:  And what made you quit?
R:  Because I got pregnant.  I decided --
L:  Oh, yeah, you told me.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But back -- but you know back in the -- when I was growing up in the -- you know, in the sixties and seventies it was acceptable to smoke anywhere that you wanted to smoke.  You could sm- -- I remember my mom and dad shopping at the grocery store, smoking a cigarette.  So, it was accepted and it just seems like over the last twenty years with all this health been going on that people don't accept people smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, it's like I say.  I'm not -- I'm not proud that I smoke, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I figure since the subject is on smoking -- now, had did you get this job Catherine?
R:  Um, I looked up -- I looked on a website and they -- they s- -- and I saw that they were doing some kind of a study and they would give you ten dollars if you called and participated by talking to people about different things and I said, "Well, what the heck.  I love to talk on the phone, so send me the money".
L:  So -- but how did they pick you to -- for me to talk to you?
R:  I -- I -- I guess because I just -- I just called in and then they just hooked us up somehow, some way.
L:  You mean to tell me I can get the same job that you have?
R:  You can -- it's just -- you just call in.  I'm calling just like you are.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  I -- yeah, I just decided to make a telephone call.
L:  Oh, is that the way it is, Catherine?
R:  Yeah, I think that's how it works.
L:  Huh.  So, now that we're -- you're just the same kind of a person as I am.
R:  Right.
L:  You will -- you were going to make the call, now you're going to talk to someone that's trying to make a call also.
R:  Right, that's how we're talking.  Yeah.
L:  Is -- is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I never knew that.  Well, see, Catherine, my son went and made five phone calls --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's ten dollars an hour --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I mean ten dollars -- five minute -- ah, excuse me, ten minutes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but he was told only three, but he got away with five.
R:  Yeah, I think it -- I think it's five.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is this the first time you're calling?
R:  No, this is the second time I've done this.
L:  Okay.  Now, you could always find out what the subject is, right?  As soon as you dial that number --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that I have.  Well, see I dialed to [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
R:  You what?
L:  I dialed to -- to cancel the study.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll tell you why.  This was a very pleasant k- kid that was talking to me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, he had my son talking to him --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- two or three times --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, so my son said, "Mom why don't you try, you make ten bucks, you know --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- in ten minutes".
R:  And he's right.
L:  And, ah-- so, he told Chris[?] about it.  So, my son says to mom -- to -- to me, "Now, go and talk to Chris".  So, I talked to Chris, so Chris has been trying to call me, Catherine, for the last week and a half and I just -- I mean, I -- I just didn't feel like talking.  I'm thinking if they give me a subject -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know how to talk about it, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- so, I said -- so, my son says -- look he goes to a different studies, you know -- research studies --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and he says to me, "Well, you know" he said, "You're delaying me of getting these phone calls because, you know, you don't answer the phone" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I got to a point where I take the phone and even --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- take it off the hook, you know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm depriving him of doing that, because sometimes he gets pretty good -- in pretty good studies, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And he's on -- only on SSI you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- I figure, you know, my conscience will bother me if I don't call up and get out of the study.  But as soon as I got on the phone, Catherine, it said it's -- the subject is about smoking --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- so I said -- I said, "Well, I -- I know I can talk a little bit amount smo- [LAUGH] you know what I mean?
R:  Well, yeah
