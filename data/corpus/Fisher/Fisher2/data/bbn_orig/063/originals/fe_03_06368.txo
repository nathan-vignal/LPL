L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  D- -- oh --
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Debbie, I'm from Pennsylvania.  How are you?
L:  Hi, Debbie, I'm fine.  My name is April and I'm from California.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, we got the whole spectrum here, haven't we?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, how do you feel about, um, banning smoking from all pub- public places?
L:  Ah -- ah, I think it's taking it way too far.  Um, I think, uh -- we deal with a lot of this here in California; we were one of the first places t- to ban it in, um, bars and restaurants.  And --
R:  Oh, they did ban it out there?
L:  Oh, gos- -- a long time ago.  I mean, it's been several years now that, um, the -- you're just not allowed to smoke at bars, restaurants, clubs, anything like that.  And my feeling on it is that I think -- I think it should be, um, the choice of the proprietor.  Because you know what?  People wanna go to a smoke free bar?  You know what?  They -- people are going to tout: smoke free bar.  And people will want to go there.  And people that wanna go and have a smoky bar and -- and, you know, have their little nicotine fit or whatever I not being a smoker -- but I mean, still, we- -- let them go.  Why -- [MN] -- let the almighty buck decide, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ...
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, and I -- I think there are places where, um ... yeah, [MN] places like restaurants and especially, like, the bars and clubs.  I think it should be up to the proprietorship.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And places where, you know, y- [SIGH] -- unsuspecting people -- no, I don't think they should be smoking in, ah, you know, movies theatres and stuff like that, but ...  You know, you're going to out, you're going to do adult stuff.  You know, all consenting adults and you can decide whether or not you wanna go there or -- or go somewhere else that is smoke free, then, you know, you choose.  You choose with your dollar and -- and as the -- supposedly this country is based on, you know, y- y- -- even more than the vote, eh, how you spend your money is -- is how things are decided.
R:  Isn't that the truth.  I kind of ag- agree --
L:  So that's how I feel about it. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I agree.  I'm a smoker.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah.
R:  And I feel that if you don't want to be around smoke then you don't go into the places that you know have it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, restaurants I understand, no smoking.  I can understand that.  You're there to eat, you don't want to inhale it.  But when you go into a bar ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... and I guess not out in California you don't.  But here, if you go into a bar, you know you're going to be in smoke.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what are you complaining about?  Don't go in.
L:  Right, and -- and you know what?  It -- somebody out there could have an entrepreneurial bonanza by -- by touting, you know, "This is a bar where we request you not to smoke" or, "We, you know --"
R:  Yes.  Uh -- yeah.
L:  "-- we don't allow smoking".  And then people that don't want to be around smokers but want to go and do the party thing can go there.  You know?  And, hey, they may make millions of dollars.
R:  Yeah, they may.  Because there are --
L:  Right, and --
R:  -- a lot of people that do not want to be around it.
L:  Right.
R:  I used to bartend and I had a guy come in -- middle of winter, if it was below zero he would leave his jacket in the car because he said it smelled like smoke and he didn't like it.
L:  Oh yeah, I hate that.  I have to admit, I mean, my husband is a smoker and, you know, he kind of goes off and on, and he doesn't smoke all that much and he's not allowed to smoke in the house around the kids.  Ever since I was pregnant, ah, with our first child, he's never smoked in the house.  And, you know, between t- the health reasons and -- it just stinks to high heaven.  We bought our first house, to start our house, and, you know, once you get smoke in there you can't get it out.
R:  No, you can't.
L:  But, you know, that's -- the- these are personal choices.  You know, a- and sure, I -- I don't -- think there are a lot of places where especially around kids and stuff like that that you don't wanna have to worry about people, you know, lighting up and, ah, you know, several inaudible words smoke.  But yeah, you go out to a restaurant, it's a smoking restaurant.  You don't wanna go?  Go somewhere else.
R:  Well, I know over here they're saying, um, in downtown Pittsburgh, they're saying that they want to ban smoking on the streets and smoking in your car.
L:  Ah, in your car.
R:  Wait a minute --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- you have no right to tell me what I'm going to do in my car.
L:  That's your personal property.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like, okay --
R:  Or on the street, how can you tell me not to have a cigarette on the street?
L:  Because -- well, don't even get me going on that.  [inaudible] Fascist state.  "You can't do anything 'cause we know better and, you know, this is ..." [LAUGH]
R:  So, what happened to, uh, your rights and your freedom?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, because to -- unfortunately I -- I tend to be very conservative and I look at this and say it's called the thin end of the wedge.  We've given in so many of our freedoms to make ourselves safer, that now people go, "Well, what's one more little thing?  And it's for your own good".  That -- it's slowly, slowly, slowly -- you look back a few years and go, "Oh, my God, what have we lost?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you don't notice it because it's a little at a time and -- and, "Big brother government --" you know, I'm not saying big brother but, I mean, looking out for you, "Paternal government is -- is looking out for your best interests, so don't worry about it, we -- we're doing the thinking for you".
R:  Yeah, but that's -- that -- I'm an adult.  I can do my own thinking and if I want to pollute my body --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that is my business --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as long as it's legal.
L:  My husband and I were just having a discussion -- I know we're getting off the topic but, um, ah -- about whether or not, uh, seatbelts other than for children, who don- -- aren't old enough to make their own decisions ah, whether or not seatbelts and motorcycle helmets should be, um, legislated.  Because, again, that's a personal choice.
R:  [MN] Yeah, that's the way I feel, it's a personal choice.  If you want to take your --
L:  And it's --
R:  -- life in your hands, that's your business.
L:  Yeah, and so it is.  It's -- it's a -- it's a slippery slope, it's hard to draw the line.  But yeah, I mean, come on, smoking on the streets, in your car, in a bar.  Hello, how many people, how many businesses have -- have suffered in -- in California --
R:  That's -- that was -- I was going to ask you that.
L:  -- because people don't wanna go out because [LAUGH] they're smoking, you know, [inaudible] as my mom always said, "The smoke drone i- -- smoke bone is connected to the drink bone".  You know, she would have her glass of wine and she'd have a smoke.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  And when she quit, she cut down on the booze because when she, you know, she had a glass of wine or -- or a beer, she wanted to have a smoke.
R:  Then she wanted a cigarette.
L:  Yeah.  And it's like, okay, well, hello, if I'm going to go out and h- -- to a bar and listen to music or hang out with my friends and, you know, throw darts or whatever, I wanna be able to have my drink and be able to have my cigarettes.  And if you don't wanna go to that kind of place, find somewhere else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... yeah, I think we're on the same page with this one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- yeah, I -- I think, um, the government is taking way too much control over my life and I don't like it.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  And, I mean, it -- there -- there's no question to it because unfortunately, again, it's [SIGH] power begets power and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like I said, I mean, once you start [SIGH] -- unfortunately it's a pendulum swing.
R:  Have the bars suffered?
L:  Has the what?
R:  Have th- the bars and the restaurants suffered?
L:  Um, we haven't heard all that much of it for a while, 'cause like I said, it's been a couple -- a few years now.  Um, but there was a big outcry at the beginning.  And you know what?  A lot of bars just let 'em, and if people -- if somebody comes in and they get fined, they get fined.  And they'll put up with the fines rather than chase away their business.  So, I mean --
R:  You can't blame 'em.
L:  -- I can't tell you how many went out of business.  I know that a lot of the -- the bigger ones, uh, a lot of places will have an outdoor patio where you can go and smoke.  Um, and they get around it that way.  Um, but y- --
R:  Well, that's -- that's not bad.  I could deal with that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, but not all places have somewhere they can go.  But there are some places that, you know, have a -- have a very strong local crowd that smoke the joint so thick that, you know, it's like pea soup London fog --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, th- -- it -- they get in, they get cited, you know what?  [LAUGH] I -- I could easily cover that with how much extra I made the -- you know, tonight, for the -- how many people drank -- came in and drank that are smokers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that would have stayed home if they couldn't smoke at -- where -- at their bar.
R:  Yep, mm, buy their case of beer or -- or their wine and take it home.
L:  That's right.  So I think there -- there were a lot of places, uh, harmed, um, but I think in the long run it just kinda ... we -- we've gotten used to the places that you have to go smoke outside, and -- and they've got, you know, umbrellas and the heaters and things like that to -- to make it so that, you know, even cold and wet weather, um, you can go outside and smoke.  But like I said, I mean, there are just some that said, "Nah, what the heck, it's not worth it to me" --
R:  And what about the, um --
L:  -- and they'll pay the fine.  Mm?
R:  Ah, it's -- mm, the smoking cessation programs that -- that they've come up with.  Do you think that it's -- I think they're a good idea for people that do wanna quit.  I have tried them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, the advice that they give you is the same thing that you get everywhere else and it really ... [SIGH] I've tried to quit four or five different times --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I always go back to the cigarettes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The stress management.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So I think the government is wasting a lot of time and effort on a program and a lot of money --
L:  Oh, don't even get me started on that.
R:  -- on a program that I don't see --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- helping many people.
L:  Well, you know what?  Give it to the -- give it to the pharmaceutical companies.  They're the ones that have the money and can make the money.  You know, they have -- I mean, they're -- they're -- they're taking out of your pocket because -- oh, well, actually in California the -- the tax on a -- a pack of cigarettes is ridiculous.  I mean, it's -- it's -- it's -- I just --
R:  Yeah, over here too.
L:  Like, fift- -- the extra fifty cents a pack or something like that, so you buy a carton, you're paying an extra five bucks, something like that.  And all -- supposedly all of that goes to prevention and, um, information and all this other stuff.  [SIGH] You know, there are things out there now that they say that -- it's like the -- you know, to get off heroin they give you this thing and in, you know, forty eight hours or seventy two hours your body's completely expunged.  And they're starting to work on stuff for nicotine like that.  Where, you know, it's not a whole lot of fun but, you know, two or three days and you don't have any in your system and -- now, nicotine's different because you have the whole, you know, cigarette in your mouth thing and the mov- -- motions and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, the hand -- the hand --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the mouth motion.
L:  And I understand that completely.  And again, like I said --
R:  Have you ever smoked?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  And clearly that's -- that's not one of the vices that -- I actually never go- -- not one of those kind of vices.
R:  Mm, I think mine is more of a emotional, um --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- attachment than it is -- well, physical, yes, but I have gotten past the cravings with the Nico- Nico- ... Nicoderm?  Yeah, the --
L:  Yeah, the patches and -- yeah.
R:  -- Nicoderm CQ patches and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've gotten past that.  It's the habit and the ...
L:  Well, that's why --
R:  ... um, stress.
L:  Right.  And that's one of the interesting things.  There's no one that has the, uh, the pretend cigarettes.  Has a little, like, a -- the little holder and you put the --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I mean, that one actually makes sense to me because it actually, you know, you're going through it a- -- but, uh -- so you -- so you're still doing you're not doing cold --
