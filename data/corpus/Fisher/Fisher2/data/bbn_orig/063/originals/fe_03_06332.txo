R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  Um, my name is Lucy and I'm participating in the Fisher project.  Are you doing the same?
R:  What's your name?
L:  Lucy.
R:  Lucy?
L:  Yeah.  What's your name?
R:  I'm Wendell, Lucy.
L:  Wendell?  Are you --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- participating in this Fisher --
R:  Yes, Ma'am.
L:  -- project?  Um, how do you feel about banning smoking in public places?  Do you feel it helps, ah, reduce the number of smokers there are?
R:  How do I feel about it? [SIGH]  I don't know.  Um, I smoke, okay. [LAUGH]  So, my opinion is -- might not be the best, but I think it's a good idea, ah, for people that don't smoke because I remember a time when I didn't smoke and I couldn't stand to smell it.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  And, ah --
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, I used to have a car that, ah -- an older car that I used to drive and -- when I was a -- a teenager.  And, ah, my little brother wanted to use my car to -- to drive to school -- went to a different school.  And, ah, he used to smoke.  So, it used to kill me.  I used to just -- I -- I made him quit driving my car 'cause he smoked in it.
L:  Oh my God.  I am so allergic to smoking [LAUGH] that it's --
R:  You --
L:  Yeah, it really --
R:  You've never smoked?
L:  No.  And it also gets into my eyes and, like, it dries out my eyes.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Like, I don't know if that happened to you before you --
R:  Now -- no, when it gets in my eyes, it burns my eyes also.
L:  Yeah, it burns really badly.  So, I think it's a good -- well, I'm not a smoker and so I, um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I believe in banning smoking in public places because if it weren't then I -- I mean, I'm allergic to it.  It would just bother me, you know, in -- in every public space that I walked into.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Well -- well, they have banned it from all public places now, haven't they?
L:  I think so.  And also -- well, do you think that cuts down on the motivation to smoke, if people have less places that they can publically smoke in?  Do you think --
R:  No, because smoking is, ah -- it's a -- it's not a -- it's not a mental thing; it's a physical thing.  Ah, it's -- ah, you know, your body craves that nicotine, you know.
L:  Oh.  So, if -- people smoked no matter.  Even if there are restrictions they'll just find a way around --
R:  Ah, they're gonna smoke. [LAUGH]  If you smoke, you're gonna smoke, you know.  I mean, [SIGH] --
L:  But, if it's a hassle to find a place where you can do it at ...?
R:  Even if there's a hassle, um, you know, you do what you have to do.  You know, like, I used to work for this company where they banned smoking in the building -- it was a five storey building.  We had ah, a -- like, ah, a -- a ten minute break. [COUGH]  It took ten minutes to get down to go outside the building to come back up to the fourth floor where I worked.  But --
L:  Oh my --
R:  But, you know, we still did it, so, you know.
L:  Hm.
R:  It just depends how bad you want a cigarette at that time, I guess. [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you think the anti smoke ads on TV and on -- like, in magazines and billboards will help ban sm- -- or, help reduce the number of smokers?
R:  Well, it has helped me in a way because now I only smoke, like, two cigarettes a day.  You know, I still -- I -- I -- and I realise that that's still not good, but by -- by seeing the effects of cigarette smoking it -- it's helping me to cut back, 'cause I used to smoke, [NOISE] you know, between fifteen and twenty a day.  So, I've cut back dramatically because of the -- the ads and stuff that I see.  And I just know smoking's not good for you.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, ah, it's -- it's -- it's really up to a person -- a person's, ah, will to quit, um, you know.  And -- 'cause everybody that smokes knows it's not -- know it -- you know, they already know it's not good for you.  So, [COUGH] I don't know.  Yeah, I think it helps.  I think the ad helps.  What do you think?
L:  I -- hm.  Well, I never smoked to start with.  And so, these ads -- like, I just ignore these ads because they don't apply to me.  But, I would think that, yeah, they would act as a reminder to pe- -- to smokers to reconsider whether they should be smoking given all that we know about it, like, all the health risks associated with it.
R:  Have you ever smoked a cigarette?
L: Yeah, I tried.
R:  Made you all dizzy and stuff?
L:  What?
R:  It made you all dizzy and stuff?
L:  No.  I just didn't like the taste.
R:  You didn't --
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  -- like that taste?
L:  -- that's why I never started.  Yeah.  I don't mean to be down on you because [LAUGH] --
R:  No -- no -- no.  I understand.
L:  I'm not trying to make you into a non smoker.  I was -- I --
R:  No, I need to be a non smoker, [LAUGH] okay.
L:  Yeah, like -- like, 'cause I just -- like, even when I go into a restaurant, and if there's one person at the bar, like, way in the front of the restaurant, and if --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm in the back I can feel -- like, my eyes will start burning.  Like, I -- I can notice cigarette smoke --
R:  Yeah, and that killed me in these restaurants where they have a smoking area and a non smoking area, because cigarette smoke goes everywhere, you know.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  And I'm really --
R:  So, if you're --
L:  -- allergic to it.
R:  -- sitting on -- way on the other side of the restaurant you still smell that smoke.
L:  Right.  Well, not only do you smell it, but, like, my eyes feel it and they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- start drying out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm not against smokers, but, like, the effect on me.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- second hand smoke is pretty strong 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it gives -- and it also gives me a headache -- the smoke.  Did -- when you were a non smoker, did the smoke, or the smell of it, give you a headache?
R:  When I was a non smoker?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] It gives me a headache now and [MN] I'm a smoker, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I'm sure it did when I was a non smoker, okay.
L:  But, I thought that the nicotine is supposed to make you feel relaxed.
R:  Huh?
L:  I thought the -- the nicotine is supposed to relax you, so how can it give you a headache?
R:  It's nicotine -- there was tar and all the other bad stuff they put in it.
L:  But, doesn't that relax you?
R:  Well, at the -- at the -- at that moment.
L:  Oh, but afterwards you get --
R:  But the effects of smoking are humongous, okay.  They dry your mouth out, they give you bad breath, they give you headaches, they [SIGH] -- they make you -- you -- you -- they just make you function differently, you know, overall.  So, it -- there's nothing good about smoking, okay?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It might -- it might make you relax for thirty seconds after you smoke it, but there's nothing -- [NOISE] I promise you -- good about it. [SIGH]  Now, what was the next thing they wanted us to talk about?  Ah, the -- the ads, and what else?
L:  Yeah, how effective those ads are in decreasing the number of smokers.
R:  I don't know.  You know, the -- they've had ads for years, okay.  About --
L:  But -- but I think with the settlement with Phillip Morris the ads have been more prominent.  Like, they have been more, like the -- p- the ads have become more numerous and more prominent.  I -- I never used to see them as much as I do now.  And, like, the tone of them -- the tone of the ads has become more serious, like, more dangerous.  Like, before they used to have that warning [PAUSE] --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And -- do they still have that warning?
R:  Yeah, on the cigarettes -- on the packets.
L:  Oh.  But now, like, there are ads --
R:  Everywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, you know what?  Um, to the best of my knowledge, there is -- there is more teenage smokers than ever before, okay.  Ah, there's more smokers period than ever before.  So, I don't know, you know.  I just -- when they came out with this nicotine thing, you know, I think they studied it first, and [SIGH] it's just a money making thing, you know.  It's just like -- it's just like almost anything else -- you know, alcohol or drugs or -- it's -- it's all about money.  And no matter how harmful it is -- you know, because look at -- look at the stuff they -- they bring over to our country, you know -- crack cocaine and, ah, heroin, you know what I mean?  It's -- it's -- it's, ah -- it's politics -- it's money.  So, [LIPSMACK] you know, and just the effects if has on a person.  You just have to basically buckle down and have that will to say you don't want to do it anymore, you know.  And -- and I think that's just like with everything else. [MN]  Cigarettes should not -- an exception. [LAUGH]  That's just my own personal opinion, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Well, you -- you said that, um, there's been an increase in teenage smoking, and in the overall population?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, do you think without these ads there would have been more?
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I guess, basically what -- what I -- what I'm -- what I see it that it really doesn't matter.  I mean, I th- -- I think it would be about around the same amount of smokers with or without because either you like it, or you don't.  Either your body get addicted to the nicotine, or it doesn't, you know, ah, regardless of the ad.  I mean, everybody knows before they read the ad that smoking is not good for you.
L:  Mm.
R:  Okay?  But -- but, at the time you're smoking, you say, "Well, it's not gonna happen to me", you know, because I know that's how I feel.
L:  What?
R:  Everybody feels that it's not gonna make them sick or whatever, you know.  And I think everybody feels the same way.  You know, it's not gonna happen to me.  Nobody thinks it's gonna happen to them, you know.  So, [LIPSMACK] that's why I think that, you know, the ads really --
L:  Are not --
R:  -- it really doesn't matter --
L:  They're not --
R:  -- ah, to me.
L:  -- effective.
R:  Huh?
L:  They're not effective, even though --
R:   Yeah --
L:  -- the tone --
R:  -- really --
L:  -- has gotten --
R:  -- because --
L:  -- more serious?
R:  Well, they're -- they're -- they're -- ah, I wouldn't say that they're -- they're -- they're -- that they're not effective because a person that doesn't smoke, ah, can just completely -- well, you know, wipe the idea of ever smoking out because of the ads.  So, I'm not gonna say that the ads are not effective, but as far as to a smoker, no [LAUGH] they're not.  I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- mean --
L:  Okay.  And, like, for a non smoker -- well, I mean, I --
R:  Yeah, for --
L:  -- just ignore them.
R:  -- a non smoker -- say, for -- for example, like you.  You know, if you -- if you happen to just take time out to read the ad and -- and say that smoking does this and this and this and this and this and this.  You say, "Oh, I'm glad I don't smoke, and I never will".  See, you -- you're -- and I look at it and I -- and I see it.  I say, "Yeah, I know", bit I smoke, so --
