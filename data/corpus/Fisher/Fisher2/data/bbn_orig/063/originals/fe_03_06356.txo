R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, my name is Nancy.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  Hey, Linda.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, here we are again. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] True enough, true enough.
L:  Are you a smoker?
R:  I am not a smoker.
L:  I am a smoker.
R:  You are a smoker?  Oh, this should be interesting then.
L:  Perhaps, and hopefully.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I just got home from work.
R:  Right.  I'm on my way driving someplace.  I just pulled over.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So I don't run myself off the road. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, great.  Oh, I w- -- [MN] [LAUGH] I already went, " [MN]" when they called.  Um, but here's -- here's my feelings, um, about this matter.
R:  Okay.
L:  They wanna know about, [LIPSMACK] um, [SIGH] the advertisements to stop smoking and whether they're effective, wasn't that an issue?  Or is that the issue?
R:  Yes, and I think, um, bans on public smoking as well.  Or --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in public places.
L:  Okay.  Well, as far as I'm concerned, some of those ads are so brutal that I light up immediately.  If cigarette is somehow -- cigarette -- smoking cigarettes is somehow stress related --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they don't do much for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. 'Cause they cause so much stress they make you -- you do it?
L:  Yeah, they're -- they're frightening and I don't --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- think that fear is a good motivator, for me, anyway.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And as far as public -- smoking in public is concerned, if I'm with people, I tell them -- I ask them before I light up, and if they're not happy, I don't.  I'm a polite --
R:  Right.
L:  -- polite person.  So --
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Although I must say, as a non smoker, sometimes -- yeah, well, I'm certain that nobody I know who smokes would light up without my permission, there are people whom I'm not with who sometimes light up near me and if it's -- if -- if it's it out in the absolute open, then --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the air carries it away and it's not a problem, but if we're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- actually enclosed somewhere --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then --
L:  It is a problem.
R:  -- nowadays -- I don't know, it used to be I wasn't as sensitive, 'cause there was so much more smoke around, and now that hardly anyone smokes a- anywhere near me, one cigarette in the whole building and I can smell it and my head starts hurting and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it can get bad.
L:  Why do you -- why do you think you're more sensitive now than before?
R:  Well, partly, um, you can't -- you're not allowed to smoke at work anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It used to be that, um, as I say, I remember when -- it was funny, they made -- they made smoking at MIT illegal, but we were out on the air force base, so that wasn't a problem, and then they made smoking in Lexington illegal, but we were out on the air base and that wasn't Lexington, then they made smoking on the air base illegal, and somehow all of the principalities that had something over us made it illegal to smoke at work and we kept smoking.  Although --
L:  Did you smoke before?
R:  They used to, I didn't.
L:  Okay.
R:  I didn't, but people used to in the hallways --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and then what you'd get is somebody smoking, while that you couldn't smoke in your office, but you could smoke in the hallways and you'd get two --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or three people that would walk up and down the hall --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of sharing with everybody. [LAUGH] So, it's kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- odd.
L:  Yeah.  My -- my concern about it though is just that it's -- it seems like things are becoming rather like a military zone, you know, with all the --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- rules and regulations being enforced that way.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I definitely believe people have a right to not be around it if they don't want to, you know?  So --
R:  But then, that said, "You have the right to smoke --" you know, it's -- it's not illegal to smoke, you have, therefore, you know, if -- if -- if what is not forbidden is permitted, you're allowed.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- you know, it -- it's a matter of judgment and everybody --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- has their own level of concern and care for other people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, [COUGH] mine's kinda high --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- and -- but, however, I just think that, you know, oh, the -- the, um, rebel in me gets really --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- annoyed about it.  Um, you know, that certain people do feel, you know, that they can -- uh, it hasn't happened to me, because I don't attract that kind of stuff, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, you'll see somebody in a restaurant or a bar, which is really ridiculous, I think, personally, lash out at somebody, and it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- h- hello, you know, [LAUGH] it's not gonna help, you know?  Um, I'm not a real bug on politeness, but I just think that the way you approach people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think a lot of people have a lot of anger and it just gives more fuel to that anger, for them to be able to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get articulate about it.  Um, so that's an annoyance.
R:  Well, and to complain in a place where it is not forbidden, I know that's never worked for me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have, on occasion, and -- actually, I have complained in places where it is forbidden, but there's not enough people around to kind of enforce it.
L:  Back it up, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I unders- -- you know, I understand both points of view, and some people are obnoxious, some smokers who are real --
R:  And some.
L:  -- dyed in wool [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're really pretty --
R:  Right.
L:  -- pretty outrageous too, um, but it's -- for -- to me, it becomes a larger issue, and that has to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do with m- -- you know, policing everything and taking less control away from the individual, and putting it more into the jurisdiction of -- of legalities.  Ah, that doesn't make me happy.  Where do you live?
R:  Right.
L:  Do you live in Massachusetts, Michigan?
R:  I live in Massachusetts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, yeah, so you're pretty much, you know --
L:  I'm in New Mexico.
R:  -- if you're going to smoke, you have to bring a tent to smoke in, 'cause you're not allowed to poison --
L:  Yeah, they're pretty s- --
R:  -- anybody's air? [LAUGH]
L:  -- pretty serious there.  By the same --
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is.  But then --
L:  [COUGH]
R: -- all, you know, all the smokers have much better skin tone than the non smokers, 'cause they have to go outside more than we do.
L:  You're hilarious. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That [LAUGH] --
R:  'Cause they have to smoke outside, so they've all got suntans all year round. [LAUGH]
L:  Either that or frostbite. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, yeah, there -- there is that issue.  But certainly the patio at Lincoln where they're allowed to smoke is, um, fairly sheltered.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so --
L:  So the non --
R:  -- you just --
L:  -- smokers dare not go out there. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you kinda --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you don't sit at that end of the cafeteria, 'cause it's -- well, first of all, 'cause the doors keep opening and you freeze [LAUGH] in the winter.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  And then the -- the smoke kinda wafts in, which you end up smelling and --
L:  So every- everybody's paying a price for it, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- but everybody's also b- -- see, I live near, um, Los Alamos National Laboratories --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and [COUGH] I think some of the, um, pollution that is emitted from that place is far more severe than a lifetime of smoking, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is proven by cancer rates up there and in the valley --
R:  Right.
L:  -- below where I live --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not to mention, um, allergies and asthma, um, yeah.
R:  Oh, and tell me about it, it -- it was, I think it was at the soccer game on Sunday, there was a little bit of wind up and it was coming from just the right direction --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- where if you looked into the sun --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you could see the pollen in the air.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, you could -- you could watch it.
L:  Dancing around.
R:  It -- 'cause we're just about at the week when there's just so much pine pollen, you get a light rain like we got today and anywhere where the puddles were, they're lined in this fluorescent green --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of the pollen --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's -- you can't believe you're breathing this stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so, you know, if it's not smokers, it's, um --
R:  The trees are out to get you.
L:  -- corporations and if it's not cor- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- that nature's gonna -- nature's -- Mother Nature says, "Ah hah, there you are --"
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- a victim".  So it's --
R:  There you go.
L:  -- a big old mess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I do, um, I really do hate those signs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think that nobody's going to go to a stop smoking group until they're good and ready --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if they, you know, if they're having, uh, pressure from their significant other or whatever, it's still probably not going to work unless they really want to.  So --
R:  Right, and see, I know of a lot of people that even though they really want to, it -- it's really hard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Nicotine's -- well, they say the most addictive drug in the world or something, I guess it depends on --
L:  Yes, and there are --
R:  -- whether [several inaudible words] badmouthing but --
L:  Gazillion chemicals.  I mean, it's a terrible, terrible, um, habit --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and still I don't think the smoking corporations are, [COUGH] you know, bearing the brunt of -- are they really -- I mean, a lot of the money that is, um, taxed for cigarettes, it's supposed to go to these stop smoking groups.  It's really going, you know, it's being filtered into other, um, programs.
R:  Oh, it's just money.  It's just money to the states.
L:  It's just money.  So that is a -- also an issue for me, you know?
R:  Although then there's this thing called the True Stella awards where they send out, um, email about lawsuits --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- and a few weeks back, the lead article was of -- I think it was Reynolds, RJR Reynolds was suing the State of California because California's anti smoking campaign has vilified the smoking companies -- the -- the cigarette companies to the point that they can no longer get a fair trial.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so therefore California's being sued that they have to stop their anti smoking campaign so that people don't think badly about the cigarette corporations.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that suit will go on for a long time.
R:  I -- I imagine it might.
L:  And again, it -- and again, it's funny. [NOISE]
R:  Although I think that if they made it parity, because apparently California's spending less on anti smoking than they're spending on pro smoking, so just make it even.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, California can't spend any more than the smoking companies spend.
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH]
R:  And that would -- that would be all right.
L:  [COUGH]
