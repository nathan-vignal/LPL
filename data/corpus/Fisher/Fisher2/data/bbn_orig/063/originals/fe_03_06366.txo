R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  What --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My name is Karen.  What's yours?
R:  Bernita[?].
L:  [LAUGH] Hi.  Well, have you ever smoked?
R:  [NOISE] No.  Yes, [MN] yes, and I love it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I don't anymore.
L:  [LAUGH] How long did you smoke?
R:  Couple of years, until my sister caught me.
L:  Oh.  You were real young then, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If it was good for me, I'd do it in a minute.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, if it was good for me.  Would you?
L:  Well, no, I actually -- I did smoke for fourteen years.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I smoked three packs a day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for fourteen years.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, and my --
R:  What kind?
L:  Huh?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Marlboro one hundreds.
R:  Oh.
L:  Big long stinking ones.  It sounds like you have a baby.
R:  Uh, eight months.
L:  Yeah, yeah, definitely not if you have a baby.
R:  No.
L:  No, you know, I wouldn't do it, because my boyfriend does it now, and the smoke -- the smell of it really irritates me, I find it really disgusting.
R:  No, if it was good for you and it wasn't bad for you and you didn't stink, then would you?
L:  I don't think so.  Why?
R:  Oh, if -- i- if it didn't hurt me, I would do it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And if it didn't smell.
L:  [LAUGH] And if it didn't cost?  It's getting more expensive all the time.
R:  Oh, sure.  There you go. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] If it were going to be free, that would be fine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it -- it made me lose weight, I'd be smoking handfuls every day.
R:  There you go, see?
L:  I'd have three going at once, I'd have a mouth full of them.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you like it --
L:  I don't know that -- that any of these other programs work though --
R:  No --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- I don't think so.
L:  No, I mean, it seems like [MN] people don't quit until they want to.
R:  No, there you go.
L:  And --
R:  And i- -- the little message they put on the ads --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think those do any good.
L:  Well, no, because, I mean, when I was smoking, I really didn't care that was -- but the part of it for me too is that I have lung disease and my whole family have lung disease, I was born with asthma --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and my grandmother died of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of lung cancer and my grandfather died of tuberculosis and my aunt died of TB, so a lot of people like me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we all kind of figure, well, it's going to get us anyway, so we may as well smoke and enjoy ourselves.
R:  [NOISE] You smoked anyway, knowing all that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we did.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I smoked for the fourteen years and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and really, the only reason I quit was because I couldn't really breathe anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] I understand.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Cool.
L:  So --
R:  We just threw a video tape down the stairs.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah, there you go.
L:  Good training.
R:  Don't want it, just throw it down.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  You're teaching her good habits, huh?
R:  Oh, it's always something --
L:  Well, they're supposed to --
R:  -- but they don't see me smoking.
L:  Huh?
R:  But they don't see me smoking.
L:  No.
R:  The kids, there you go.
L:  Well --
R:  I've got one good thing.
L:  Well, that's good though.  You're setting a good example.
R:  I know.
L:  I know it's really hard for -- for people to quit.  I mean, my boyfriend's been trying for years, it just irritates him whenever people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- start nagging at him, and he never --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smokes in the house, and he always goes outside, and actually, I don't know what he does, but when he comes back inside, he doesn't smell --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I really can't complain --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- other than I figure -- and I don't even think it's hurting his health, frankly.  I think he's as big and as strong as a mule, so I bet --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it won't even hurt him, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it -- [LAUGH] you know, his --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- lungs are in great shape --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I know, you know, whenever I say to him I'm gonna call one eight hundred butts, no butts or whatever that is, I mean, they won't do it --
R:  They won't?
L:  -- they're just not [several inaudible words] it.  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No one I know -- a- and they don't wanna use the -- they -- the first thing about the patches, they say the patches are expensive, but then --
R:  Like cigarettes aren't.
L:  Well, the -- you know, I don't know that many people that really wanna use them either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Kansas. [NOISE]
L:  Kansas?
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Well, see, I live in California, so you --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- might have people that smoke back there.
R:  Oh, they smoke everywhere.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, out in LA, hardly anyone ever smokes anymore.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's very unusual, and it's very politically incorrect.
R:  [LIPSMACK] In restaurants here, they'll have a little index card taped to the wall that says, "No smoking" about [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on two tables --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but all the other tables in the restaurant won't say it.
L:  [LAUGH] You're kidding?
R:  No, I'm not.  We went to Chinese food last night and two of the tables had a little sign, a- and it was an index card turned over. [NOISE]
L:  Really?
R:  That's how big it was and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- two tables said no smoking.
L:  [LAUGH] And --
R:  Because my five year old looked at the sign and wanted to know what it -- he's learning --
L:  What it --
R:  -- to read. [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Well, obviously they don't enforce it then, right?
R:  [NOISE] Well, you can't smoke at those two tables.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Well [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] I -- I mean, that's how far it's enforced.
L:  See, in LA, you really can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smoke anywhere inside a  building --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you have to not only go outside, you have to go to a specified smoking area.
R:  [LIPSMACK] We were at the grocery store today, and a woman was smoking down the aisle --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- in the grocery store.
L:  -- God.
R:  Yeah.  But you get that when you live in Kansas.
L:  Well, you know, I know too, though, I have a friend that's from there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and he said his brother eats meat, like, three times a day too and that's not very common out here either.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, no.  Uh, yeah, that -- absolutely, Kansas, that's what you do.
L:  Yeah?
R:  No vegetables.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] You sound like you're [LAUGH] -- you're just -- you're a -- a preacher for the [LAUGH] -- the lifestyle up -- no vegetables, ever --
R:  No.
L:  -- only eat meat.
R:  That, uh, that's what people here do.
L:  Really?
R:  And when you go to a steak restaurant, there's one nearby --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it is filled with smoke, they have a grill inside the restaurant that they grill everything on, there's dust everywhere and grease.
L:  Well, how can they complain about smoking when you're going and sitting inside a smoky place, too?
R:  Oh, I know, uh, but the steak is bigger than the p- -- than the plate [NOISE] and there's no -- they don't serve vegetables, they just serve the meat --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the whole meal is just the meat.
L:  Just a huge, big --
R:  Steak.
L:  -- slab of meat? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, actually, in New -- New York, New York Central Park, which is huge, it's illegal to smoke in the park and I know Germans --
R:  In a park?
L:  -- that have told me they won't come to the United States anymore.  This was before the war, before nine eleven, before they disagreed with us about the w- -- before anything, they said they wouldn't come here anymore because there's no place they can smoke and they all smoke rather avidly.  I mean, one right after the other.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, Europeans still smoke quite a bit.
R:  Well, they can come to Kansas and smoke anywhere they want.
L:  I -- I -- they can come to Kansas and smoke anywhere --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I bet they could go to Texas too and smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  But they cannot come to LA and smoke anywhere they want, they'd have their butts kicked out of places so fast.
R:  They make 'em leave?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's against the law.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't think I've even noticed anyone that's even tried it.  They might sneak into the bathroom and try it or something, but they'd be busted.  I mean, if someone walked in and lit up a cigarette in a stall, someone else would go out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and tell the hostess or host of the restaurant or the bar or whatever.  Yeah, it's just not allowed indoors.
R:  It's absolutely [NOISE] the opposite.  I'm in a very rural town [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and if anyone complained about someone smoking, you would be asked to leave before the smoking person.
L:  I would think so.
R:  "Well, if you don't like it, leave".  Yeah.
L:  I mean, if -- so you don't -- obviously you don't see much anti smoking advertisements or anything there, do you?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, not in Kan- -- no, not at all.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  Does the subject ever come up?
R:  Um, people complain about the price of it but, no, people don't -- no. [NOISE]
L:  Well, what does a pack of cigarettes cost you back there now?
R:  Oh, I have no idea.
L:  You don't know?
R:  No.
L:  I hear, uh, when I smoked, it was, like, it was -- I was started when I was fourteen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which was quite a while ago.
R:  And then you smoked for t- -- fourteen years?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I started when I was fourteen, and I started with Camels, you know, the ones without the filters 'cause, you know, you're a teenager, you wanna impress everyone with how tough you are so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] so -- and then of course I went to Marlboros because everyone in California smokes Marlboros, it's the red box --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the cowboy imagery.  We all want to be the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- cowboy, right?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, [LAUGH] and we went to Marlboros, but the thing was that, um, now, I mean, back then it was, like, seventy five cents for a pack of cigarettes, which I'm sure I thought was a lot of money, but now I think it's, like, up to almost five dollars, just for one pack of twenty cigarettes.  Hello? [PAUSE] Hello? [NOISE]
