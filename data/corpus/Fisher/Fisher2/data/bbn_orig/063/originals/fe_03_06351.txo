L:  Hello, I'm Vanessa.
R:  Hi, Vanessa.  My name is Sharon and I don't think they should ban smoking from public places.
L:  I do.
R:  You do? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I'm -- I'm a non smoker.
R:  So am I.
L:  And, um, it's really aggravating.  How could you not think they shouldn't ban, uh, smoking?
R:  Well, I think if it's a -- a reputable, good place, they make sure that the smoking section is away --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from the regular section.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, if you go into certain restaurants --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like Friendly's has a special room that's just for smoking, and if you're in a non smoking area, you don't even know that there's people in another room smoking.
L:  Well, Friendly's, not a lot of Friendly's have it like that. [NOISE] Whatever -- what -- I don't know what [NOISE] -- what Friendly's location you're talking about, but the ones that I go to --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- y- -- it's a big difference.
R:  Is it?
L:  And it's hard -- yeah, and it's hard to try to eat with all that smoke being blown -- I mean, 'cause it's -- it's not like it's a wall --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you're gonna smell, and you being a non smoker, I can't believe ... you will, you know, agree to that.
R:  Well, I -- I -- most of the places that I frequent --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, the smoking and the non smoking sections aren't near each other, and if you're going to a bar or a place like that, you kinda just expect that there's going to be smoke there.
L:  Yeah, in a bar, it's -- it's -- I guess a bar is kinda like where they can do it a lot, but a restaurant, no.  And then your children, when you're going in a restaurant with little children, who's to say they're not -- you got to get -- you might have to go through the smoker section to get to the bathroom.
R:  That's true.
L:  And they got to go through there.
R:  That's true --
L:  So --
R:  -- I wouldn't want my daughter walking through secondhand smoke.
L:  Yeah, like, see, we're adults, we're -- we can better choose but, like, a child, you have no choice but to -- you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're, like, more exposed, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that would be great --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if they can ban smoking in, um, public restaurants.
R:  Right.
L:  And just in general.
R:  Well, they've raised the price so much I can't believe --
L:  I know.
R:  -- that many people still smoke. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The price of cigarettes is, like, close to five dollars now.
R:  Um, I'm in Virginia Beach, Virginia, but I know in New York, it's up to, like, seven dollars a pack --
L:  And --
R:  -- it's really insane.
L:  -- and see, I'm in Philadelphia --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so that's -- that's probably why, 'cause I never came across it on location in Friendly's, when -- where they have a room.
R:  It must be, 'cause the Friendly's that we have near us just opened six months ago.
L:  Oh.
R:  So they must have planned right, and they do, they have a whole separate room that's for smoking.
L:  Yeah, that -- that -- yeah.  Maybe that's why.
R:  But I know if you go, like, into an IHOP --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the, um, smoking section isn't that far away from --
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's not --
R:  -- the regular section.
L:  -- it's not a real -- you know, it's no real different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, like, smoking, you're going to smell it and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I didn't like the smell.
R:  Now, when they also stated the topic, I didn't understand, they were also talking about something with a -- a call in, something, pro- -- non smoking program?  Did you listen to the whole thing?
L:  No, she said -- she talked too fast.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, it wasn't just me. [LAUGH] All I hear- -- understood was banning s- smoking in public places and then she -- the recording said something else and I couldn't understand that.
L:  Y- yeah, um --
R:  I used to smoke.
L:  Oh, well, see, I tried it when I was young.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I felt really stupid holding it to my mouth and it's -- I don't know, it's just -- I -- oh, I just -- it's just a waste of money to me, and it gets in your -- it's, like, it gets in your pores, 'cause all smokers, they, like, s- smell a certain way.
R:  Oh yeah, and that --
L:  And then, like, everything they taste --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- honestly, they can't taste it 'til, like, their fourth or fifth spoonful, you know?
R:  Yeah, now that I don't smoke, you -- if you walk into somewhere where somebody's been smoking --
L:  You can s- --
R:  -- or even if they were in a place, and they weren't smoking and other people were --
L:  You can smell it.
R:  -- you can smell it really bad.  I know, um, here in Virginia --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was -- they consider it still tobacco country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they're having a hard time getting laws passed to ban smoking in public places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know in New York, where I'm originally from, they recently just banned it from public places, and they're having mixed reactions from it.
L:  Oh, yeah, 'cause there's a lot of smokers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they don't understand, I mean, with -- when you start, when you smoke, you're gonna -- it -- it's gonna speed up your process to -- to pass away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then cancer, it's, like, so many people, like older people, they have, like, that nasty cough and it's, like, oh God.
R:  Yeah, well, that's why I don't smoke anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I just -- I just, mm, I just can't do it, and then I have little ones now, so --
R:  Mhm.  Well, that's why I had to quit.
L:  It's -- it -- it's costly.
R:  Yeah, it's expensive and it -- it's -- it's bad for you, and you're right again, you don't want to expose your children to secondhand smoke.
L:  And that's killing them fa- faster than regular smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  I think the businesses though are just afraid that, um, if they ban, uh, ban smoking in public places that they're going to lose a lot of business.
L:  Yeah, yeah, well, that's understandable.  But then, like you said, the way you said the Friendly's is blocked off in a certain room, then that's okay if it's like that, but when you have, like, open space, there's no way in the world you're going -- the smoke is going to, you know, stop at that table line.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if you're sitting, like, right at the borderline, it's -- it's just no way.
R:  Right, and even, like, a lot of times, as you say, non smoking, you still sometimes are near --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tables, people that are -- are smoking.
L:  I know.  I know, and it's not like they're gonna -- you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then -- I don't know, their smoking is getting into your food and that'll mess it up.
R:  Well, wasn't California the first state to ban smoking in public places?
L:  I'm not sure --
R:  I- --
L:  -- I don't smoke, so I don't really try to keep up on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- basic -- but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I do know, like -- and then another thing about it is that, like, when you go into a restaurant and when there's no smoking, it seems like you gotta wait longer for, like, a non smoking area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It seems like the non smoking area's getting smaller than the smokers -- smoker area.
R:  It's probably 'cause most -- most of the people want to sit in non smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it still seems to me like the smokers have the biggest section.
R:  Yeah, it does seem that way.  I -- I notice, um, a lot of times when we go places, there's on- -- there's not many people smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there are a lot of, um, hotels and stuff now too where they've banned it.  Restaurants, I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are just really slow to do it, I think, 'cause they're just afraid they're going to lose a lot of people, but if you're at a restaurant in a hotel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or you're at a function in one of their, you know, banquet rooms --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you can't smoke in there.
L:  I don't see why they would ban smoking in hotels though, 'cause, um, you know, in your room, [MN] --
R:  Well, they have special smoking rooms, but if you're in the area where, um, anybody can be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, in the lobby --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or in the banquet room, you can't smoke in there.
L:  But it shouldn't matter if you're in your, you know, your hotel room, whether you smoke or not, 'cause that's your privacy, and plus you paid.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know, but, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, but my personal opinion, if they want to ban it all, great.
R:  Well, I -- I also have noticed, like, going into restaurants and bars, it used to be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- every time you went in somewhere, they had a cigarette vending machine right there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't see those anymore.
L:  Well, 'cause it's easier for teenagers to get at 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  Because, you know, it's -- it -- they're not going really be w- watching the cigarette machine.
R:  Yeah, but now they do that thing, you can save the -- collect the points and send it in for things, I mean, that's geared towards teenagers too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, I saw a kid get off the bus the other day, he was two feet away from the bus and he took a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it.  He's not supposed to have cigarettes in school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Let alone on a bus.  I mean, he was a high schooler, but still.
L:  When I was in high school, they used to have -- they would let the teenagers smoke in -- like, in a -- you know, like at a job, they have a spot, they w- --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- they would let the teenagers smoke, like, in the back of the school.
R:  I'm --
L:  And it would be, like, a whole bunch of 'em.
R:  -- I'm thirty four, and we had a courtyard off our cafeteria --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in high school that you could go outside and smoke.  Now, you can't even have tobacco products on school property, even if you're an adult, you're not supposed to have tobacco products on school property.
L:  I don't think they have that in Philadelphia yet.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I don't they have it in Philadelphia yet.
R:  Well, here you're not allowed to, and if you get caught -- not -- and we're not talking smoking, if you get caught with a cigarette on your persons --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you get suspended.
L:  I don't think they have that in Philadelphia yet.  In Philadelphia, it was l- -- it is -- well, when I was in school, 'cause I'm thirty four too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When I was in school, it was, like, you know, kids, you know, we'd take a break, and they would be out there smoking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it -- but then I guess back then it wasn't really an issue as it is now, because now -- and it's like they're putting stronger -- they're putting things in that cigarette.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So --
R:  Exactly.  All the, um, added tars and everything, it's not just the tobacco, it's all the chemicals that they're putting in the paper.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that they're putting in the tobacco to make it burn slowly, that's what's causing the cancer.
