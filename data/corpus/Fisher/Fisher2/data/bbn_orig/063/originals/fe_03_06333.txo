R:  [NOISE] My name is Christy[?].
L:  Um, hello, my name is Shirley[?]. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh.  Um --
R:  How are we today?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  How are you --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- doing today?
L:  Oh, I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Just fine.
L:  So, I [NOISE] -- are you a smoker?
R:  Ah, no I'm not actually. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I'm not either.
R:  Oh, well that's a good thing, we both agree on that one subject.
L:  Yes.  It's hard to, ah, set -- I mean, I don't like it when other people smoke in public places because not being used to the smoke it's --
R:  It almost chokes you.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  So -- but I don't know exac- -- you know, if they're deciding a -- you know, a -- as a public place or building or even outdoors, I don't know, but I w- -- have relatives that smoke and -- and -- and, ah, I don't know.
R:  I know.  It's -- it's really kind of a hard stand to make because my mother she's overweight and she's a very heavy smoker and I just couldn't imagine her going to a mall or even to -- per say, Walmart and having to say outside and smoke her cigarette, ah, because she just wouldn't go.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But me on the other hand, you know, I want to be able to know I can go into a big stadium or a big auditorium and know I'm not going to get choked to death by everybody else smoking.
L:  Yes, that's the way I feel too.
R:  And I know that there doing a lot to, ah, try to help prevent new smokers in that concept of, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- younger, teenagers and just young kids all in general, from smoking.
L:  I think that the prevention programs, the -- all the things that they mentioned, have to be a good idea.  I mean, um [MN]-- don't know h- how many people are affected by it, you know, that -- whether they decide not to smoke because of these things but I don't see how it could be --
R:  I don't think it's hurting any --
L:  -- [several inaudible words].  Yeah.
R:  -- any either.
L:  Mhm.  Right.  It --
R:  I think -- I think the people that do smoke it gets more annoying to see the constant ads of -- you know, these commercials that are -- are really hitting towards the young teenagers of, "Talk to your parents about not smoking" you know, even though we know it's their choice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's a very hard choice to make, especially when you get peer pressure and then once you start doing it, "Hey look, now I'm cool".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But in reality, if you actually had to do that to be cool, you're hanging with the wrong parents[?] anyways. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  I think my brother in law and his wife I think they stopped part- -- I think it was sort of a peer pressure thing, of course it was getting pretty expensive with all the price increases but yet when you go to places and you're always being told, "You can't smoke here" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's sort of a peer pressure in that, you know -- but I think that's -- the biggest fear of why they quit --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- between the two things. [LAUGH]
R:  In that same aspect, it's almost banning their right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because you know, they have their-- they have their freedom to smoke, but also -- and everybody's saying, "Well, you can't smoke here.  You can't smoke here.  You can't smoke here and you can't smoke there".  Being a non smoker, I say, "Yeah, go for it" [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but if I was a smoker it's like, "How many more handcuffs are you going to put on me?" until the fact of, "I can't go anywhere, not even in my own home because my children are in there, and smoke".
L:  Yeah, if they could put a bubble around themselves and smoke inside of [LAUGH] it.  But smoke will just --
R:  Or until they come up with --
L:  -- drift over.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That would be a good idea t- -- that would be a concept.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If you're going to smoke, you have to make yourself a bubble that you can walk outside in smoke. [LAUGH] I mean -- because even when ou go in the woods and stuff, you know, they -- they tell the smokers -- they'll ask, you know, when you go camping, if you're smokers and if you are, you know, "Make sure your cigarette butt is out before you leave it --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  You drop it on the ground and smear it out or not" and that's out in the great outdoors --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but this -- [inaudible] so quickly that -- that just one butt can catch on fire and just destroy, you know, so much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, houses to unfortunately innocent children or family members --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to wildlife.  It's -- it's -- you kind of wonder if the cause is greater than the -- you know, concept of smoking.
L:  Mm.  I think you're right, because [SIGH] a lot of things we're losing our freedom because people don't use their ri- rights correctly, so.
R:  Right.  But I mean, they -- they fuss and complain because, you know, the kids are being beat at home when they're only getting disciplined but yet you have these, you know, extreme cases where [NOISE] you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like, "Why are you even getting involved in this?" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and smoking -- you know, it has its good points for my sister.  You know, she had three kids, found out she was pregnant again, nervous wreck, ah, her husband was gone most of the day because of his job and she was a housewife and she couldn't take any kind of medicines, because she was pregnant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they just told -- and the doctor flat out told her, "You need to smoke at least -- no more than two cigarettes a day to keep your nerves down, otherwise you will miscarry".
L:  Wow.
R:  And, um, [MN] she said that was the only way that she could stay calm if her, you know, other three girls, ah, were just going frenetically crazy, because she had her first three in three years.  So, you know how close they [LAUGH] are.
L:  Oh, my.  I hope the next one wasn't the next year. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, total were she had four kids in five years.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, she waited about a year and a half before she had the [LAUGH] other one, so.  You can just imagine their ages and going through the potty training issues and them starting to get the sassy mouth and that was the only way she could calm herself --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I couldn't say anything about it, because I didn't want to see her miscarry and I didn't want to see her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, lose the baby and go on a nervous breakdown --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but on the same aspect, I know that -- cigarettes that she's inhaling are hurting the baby.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it's like --
L:  So, was she able to quit afterwards?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Mhm.
R:  But she's not a heavy smoker as she once was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Actually, in that aspect it's good but she doesn't -- she does go outside.  She doesn't care if it's freezing cold outside.  She said that it makes her smoke it a lot quicker and she's back in the house. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  She says -- but she's not doing it around her kids.  She did it while they were pregnant -- you know, while she was pregnant --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- with each of em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [MN] the only side effect that one of the last one came out with was a cleft lip and they said that -- you know, that didn't necessarily come from smoking --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the doctor said, "Well, since you've cut down so dramatically, from what you were smoking, you know, you've probably done -- did the baby more good than you did harm, you know, by smoking".
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  And I couldn't get on her, because I didn't want her to physically hurt herself, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and just do something that she would regret later, but yet in the same aspect, it's like, "How can you sit there and do that, you know you're pregnant, you know you have these other kids and ..." [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so I don't -- it's -- it's good if they -- if it keeps the kids -- the young kids or even up to the teenagers and -- you know, the legal aging to keep them from buying them and smoking them so young, getting them started.  But in the same aspect I can imagine that it gets annoying for everybody else who is smoking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who constantly see these, you know, "Don't smoke!" ads.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think they kind of understand the same aspect that those commercials are geared towards the kids --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- whereas, you know, a lot of them you'll ask if they hadn't started when they were younger, they probably wouldn't be a smoker.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's like --
L:  So, do you think that the ads and stuff are ...?
R:  I think they help the kids and I think the way that they're starting to do them more towards the fact of -- the parents are getting involved, I think that that is a good response and appearance for the kids.  Because nowadays the parents aren't involved --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the concept of -- you know, you've got all these, ah, [NOISE] programs that help the kids to stay away from it.  You know, these bowling leagues and the community centers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that help the kids find something else to do besides putting themselves in that peer pressure situation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's like -- you know, I'm glad to see it because I hate to see these young kids, one wasting their money [LAUGH] because those things, like you said --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- are expensive. [LAUGH]
L:  I sort of think it would be even more effective if they would let --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- children work on these ad campaigns, at least on chil- -- if it's an adult telling children --
R:  Well, it's kind of -- it --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- if the -- the ones that I'm particularly talking about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are the ones that -- where you have the teenagers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are out with their friends and somebody, you know, lights up a cigarette --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's, "Here, you want one?" and she goes, "No.  No thanks" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know -- and they kind of do the, ah -- you know, put the little symbol acr- across the screen that says, ah, "Talking to -- talk to your kids, they do listen".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And it'll show a backdrop as to when the dad or the mom was talking to their teenager, you know, about
