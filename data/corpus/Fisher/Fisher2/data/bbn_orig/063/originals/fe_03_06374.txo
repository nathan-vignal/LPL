R:  Uh, this is Riley.
L:  Hi, this is Wanda.
R:  How you today?
L:  How are you?
R:  Good [NOISE].  So, what do you think about ...?
L:  The smoking in public places?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's a good thing.  I'm a -- I'm a smoker actually and, um, they just started banning it in the county that I live in in Michigan and, um, I think it's a -- I think it's a good thing, especially in restaurants.
R:  Well, I guess I -- I'm a smoker too and I don't believe that -- you should  have a right to smoke wherever you want and that they should have a reserve place for it [NOISE] but --
L:  Do you think it's okay, like, in restaurants though?  With like babies around and stuff.
R:  Well, they should have a separate place for us and --
L:  Right, so like indoor but like maybe just like for older people who smoke.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, if the -- you know, if the parent brings them in there that's [NOISE], you know, that's the normal for them but, you know, it's just -- I mean it's getting to where you can't smoke anywhere anymore and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pretty soon the homeless people are gonna start complaining because everybody's outside smoking.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think it's kind of absurd though how in, like, restaurants there's like no barrier it's just like the [LAUGH] table next to you pretty much, that could be like smoking and then non smoker and it's like -- I mean I smoke but when I eat, like, I don't like, like, smoke being around me.  It's just like uncomfortable.
R:  Yeah, it actually don't bother me [NOISE] but --
L:  What do you think about, um --
R:  I think they should have it split up, you know --
L:  What did you say?
R:  I think they should have a smoking side and a non smoking side.
L:  With like a big wall or something because usually --
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the smoking side is just like --
R:  Oh, yeah it's all the same thing we're all breathing the same air but --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  It should be split up, you know.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree, if they're gonna have it indoors then they should split it up with better ventilation too, you know.
R:  I pay good money for cigarettes and then I gotta go outside and smoke, that's just not right.
L:  But --
R:  Because I'm paying a lot of taxes when I buy cigarettes. 
L:  No, I know but I don't know, at the same time though other people are breathing in, like, toxic chemicals.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's an addiction, you know.
L:  No, exactly.  And that's what's horrible about it is, like -- I don't know I'm trying to quit right now and it's really difficult.  But I think that -- I think the smoking campaigns do a good job.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What do you think about the, um, anti smoking campaigns?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't know they -- they don't really promote it that much anymore.  The anti smoking campaigns, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're, um -- well, I guess I've never really paid too much attention to 'em --
L:  Really?  There's this, um --
R:  -- because I'm a smoker.
L:  -- billboard, um, on the freeway going to the airport and it's just like this woman's mouth and it has like [LAUGH] a hundred cigarettes stuff into her mouth and, um, I always see that one and that one always sticks with me.  I don't know I think that's a pretty good one [NOISE]
R:  Well, uh, in South Dakota it's pretty barren out here, you don't see much of that out here so --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  South Dakota.
L:  South Carolina?
R:  South Dakota.
L:  Oh, South Dakota, okay.
R:  Yeah.  And you don't see much of that around here.
L:  How much are cigarettes there?
R:  Uh, three dollars a pack.
L:  Three dollars, okay.  'Cause they're like four seventy five here.  And I think that's another thing that, um, different states are doing that's probably going to help people -- more people quit is just keep on, like, raising the prices.  Like I know in New York City it's like seven fifty a pack --
R:  Wow.
L:  An average pack like Marlboros or Winstons or whatever and I think if they keep on doing that I think people will start to [LAUGH] quit more and more.  Because we can't --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I --
L:  -- I don't know, I can't find cigarettes for less than four dollars anywhere.
R:  Well, you can here.
L:  That's crazy.
R:  But --
L:  Do you think that's part of it?  Do you think -- do you think you'd have more of an incentive to quit if it was --
R:  Well, like I said, it's an addiction.  I mean, I don't care how much money the government puts into anti drug campaigns, they're not going to stop people from doing the drugs, it's an addiction.
L:  Right.
R:  Alcohol's an addiction, you know.  And if people want it they're gonna get it, prohibition proved that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, when they had -- when alcohol was banned that didn't stop people from doing it.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  What about people who -- I don't know I've only bee- I've been smoking for, like, three years and so about the people who like have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who like want to quit and they probably have like more of a potential to quit than people who maybe have been smoking for like a long time.  Do you think, like, raising prices and advertising against smoking and stuff is helpful?
R:  Nah, it's not gonna do any good.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't believe they're doing good out there.  It's -- well, I'm just say -- take religious for instance, you can preach it all you want but people who are gonna accept it are going to accept it and that's all there is to it.  You know, it's what each individual person wants, you know.  If they're gonna have a cigarette they're gonna pay twenty dollars for a pack, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  They don't care how it is there -- there's still gonna be people smoking and, you know, it's just -- it's almost being unfair to the people who do smoke because they are addicted and it -- it's unfair to them -- and [inaudible] myself here because I do smoke.  It's unfair that they should target me.
L:  Right.
R:  It is -- if everybody in the United States quit smoking, well the tobacco industry -- industry would go down and how many thousand and thousand of jobs will go down there.  And then you turn around and all the taxes they we've been paying on that, all the government and the state and the cities are all going to be out that much money.  And then what they gonna do?  Then they're --
L:  I mean, don't you think that --
R:  -- gonna raise -- raise your property tax and they're -- you know, they're just gonna raise everything else, then they'll target --
L:  I mean, don't you think that --
R:  -- something else.
L:  -- I don't know, we're advanced enough to like find other ways to, like --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- grow money.
R:  To do what?
L:  To grow money, besides like supporting an industry that's basically a sin industry and, you know --
R:  Well, alcohol is too.
L:  No, yeah, definitely.
R:  Alcohol is more so than cigarettes.
L:  But do you think that, like, us saying that, you know, "Oh, where is the American economy gonna be, where are all these people going to go without their tobacco supported jobs and stuff" don't you think that's like, sort of, a cop out?
R:  They'll just -- they'll just be transferred in like drugs are.  I mean, that's just -- you know, there's ways around it, I mean --
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't care how much you try to tax it to death, how much -- you'll never get rid of it because I myself I've been smoking since -- well, let's see, probably about twenty five years.
L:  Wow.
R:  So -- I always told myself when cigarettes got to be two bucks a pack I would quit.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  So, I haven't quit yet.
L:  Right.  Do you feel like you want to quit?
R:  No, I enjoy smoking.
L:  No, I mean, I do too but at the same time, I mean, I don't know I get sick from it, you know, when I smoke too much.  I mean, when I smoke like a few a day it's, like, fine but if I smoke, like, a lot a day I'll actually get like really sick.  Like I'll get a head cold and I'll cough and sneeze and stuff.  It's just uncomfortable and it [LAUGH] makes my breath stink. [NOISE].
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Do you think that there is any kind of campaign or advertising that would make you quit?
R:  Nope, I've seen some pretty nasty ones.
L:  Really?  So, there's nothing --
R:  My mom --
L:  -- you could even ever imagine that would make you just, "Oh god, I'm never gonna turn to cigarettes again"? [NOISE]
R:  No.  My mom died of lung cancer and that was [NOISE] hard on me but I still smoke.
L:  Wow.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Did she smoke a lot?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, did my dad.  He died shortly after her too of heart failure.  I don't know I -- I think chewing is, uh, pretty nasty too.  If you're gonna get rid of cigarettes you should get rid of chewing too.
L:  Yeah, it's probably just as bad, yeah.
R:  You know, people get throat cancer and all that and, I mean, they have to have their whole jaw and everything amputated.
L:  Right.
R:  From that stuff, you know.
L:  It's nasty.
R:  Okay then, once they do that then it's gonna be alcohol -- alcohol's gonna be gone, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're gonna -- they're gonna target alcohol.  After that they're gonna target guns and we aint gonna have no guns.  After that they're gonna target something else and something else and it's just gonna keep going on and on and on until it's -- United States is basically a communist state. [NOISE] That's --
L:  Yeah, I don't --
R:  -- my opinion.
L:  -- I don't know if they'll ever get to that point.
R:  [COUGH] Well, I mean, everybody's gotta complain about something but ...
