R:  [NOISE] Hello? [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Jackie, who's this?
L:  This is Dorothy Clanton.
R:  Hi, Dorothy.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Coffeen, Illinois.  Where are you from?
R:  You are?  I'm in South Florida. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're in sunny Florida.
R:  Well, it's not sunny today.  It's been raining since first thing this morning.
L:  Oh, mercy. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, what's it like there?
L:  Well, it's kinda chilly.
R:  Is it really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Mm, t- --
L:  We've got a cold front come through and -- at least it dried us out.
R:  W- [LAUGH] well, that's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- probably good then. Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, for us now we're getting your rain but I couldn't handle it being cold.  I've lived here all my life.
L:  Oh, well, it was, like, uh, upper forties this morning --
R:  Oh, good God, no.
L:  -- which is -- which is very, very unusual for in May.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  I had to kick the furnace on, warm the house up a little. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, at least you've got that.  So, they want us to talk about terrorist +attacks --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- atta- ...
L:  Mm.
R:  And the question that I heard on my end was: would most people panic? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I say they would.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I can't imagine that they wouldn't.
L:  Well, I think they would be one of 'em if they didn't.
R:  I -- I -- right, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because if they weren't panicking that means they know what's happening.
L:  That's right, they'd know --
R:  A- --
L:  -- where to run and hide. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, and quite frankly, when I saw the -- when I saw the World Trade Center when that happened, I was watching it on my home -- on my television at home and I was in a panic.
L:  I was too.
R:  You know, I --
L:  I was watching The Today Show.
R:  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  And the first plane had hit and they cut in and they were showing -- telling about it, and about that time the second one hit and I was just sat there thinking, "Oh, my God".
R:  Right, that's what I kept -- well, I was vacuuming and the phone rang and I just happened to be next to it and my husband says to me, "Have you turned on the television?" and I said, "No", and he said, "Well, you need to turn it on".
L:  Uh-huh, yes.
R:  And I just stood there and I looked, and I thought it was fake. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, I kind of think that the United States has really overstepped their bounds of letting foreigners come in here.
R:  Well, it seems that they may have, in the fact that we're being far too relaxed --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- on -- on monitoring them.
L:  Yes.
R:  And while I don't agree with ... while I don't agree with -- with prejudice, I do --
L:  No, I don't neither, no.
R:  -- I do agree with a thorough background investigation.
L:  Oh, yes, I do too.
R:  You know, from somebody -- I mean, these people [several inaudible words] about three hours away from here where they were taking --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- flying lessons.
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I m- --
L:  I mean, they don't investigate +close enough to foreign people that's coming into the country.  And that would be the same if we went to another country, they didn't investigate us +close enough.
R:  Right, and they do, they do it all the time, they -- as a matter of fact, some of the people in other countries kidnap us because they think that -- that we're spies and that we're t- --
L:  Oh, sure, sure, yeah.
R:  So why would we, in the most civilized country in the world ...
L:  And now we're under a orange alert again.
R:  Again, I know, but I'm wondering what triggered [NOISE] this orange alert.
L:  Because of the, uh, overseas bombing and, uh --
R:  Oh, the -- in w- -- in Israel?
L:  Yes.
R:  And what about at the college?  What was -- have they found out anything about the college yesterday?
L:  Um -- no, I don't think they have.
R:  Really?
L:  I don't think they've found out anything.  If they have, they haven't let us know anything.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that might be really better because I think the United States is a little loose lipped on that stuff.
R:  Well, yes they have because they've --
L:  Like the war and all that.  I think they was a little too loose lipped on that.
R:  This time they were.
L:  Yes.
R:  During Desert Storm it was terrifying how -- how tight they were with what they released.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  An- and I personally had a family member, my sister, wi- -- in Desert Storm.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I had never had a clue of -- of where her -- what her whereabouts, what might have been happening in her life day to day, and this time I must say that we at least had an opportunity to see --
L:  Yeah, you could see your loved ones on the front line and some of 'em even getting wounded.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] which is devastating.
L:  And a hund- -- and I -- I don't know.  But, uh, no, I don't agree with the terrorism.  I -- yes, I would say that everybody in their right mind should be scared.
R:  Well, of course they should.
L:  I'll bet.  And they should b-, uh ... always kinda look for your surrounding, you know, kind of watch where you're going and what you're doing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and who's around you.
R:  Right, all the time.  But you know what?  Even more -- to me, because I'm --
L:  You get relaxed.
R:  -- the parent of -- I'm the parent of three young children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and in fifteen years, when my children start to graduate from high school, what will their world be.
L:  Well, I have a --
R:  Wi- will terrorism be here like it is in Israel?
L:  I have a great granddaughter that is a year and a half old, and I just was told I have another one on the way. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And so [MN] I'm just thinking, "Yes, I'm thrilled to death to be a great grandmother again but what is this world going to be for my great grandchildren?"
R:  Yes, I really wanna know.  What --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what will my son's life be like?  What will his children's life be like?
L:  Yeah, I mean, if we're --
R:  I mean, will they -- go ahead.
L:  If we're guarded all the time or if we can't guard ourselves well enough ...
R:  W- what about when they get on the city bus to go to the mall and there's some moron --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- some idiot next to them with a pa- -- a suicide bomber.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What happens to my children?
L:  Yeah.  They get --
R:  Do they have to live in fear?
L:  Yes, I think -- I think we've been too relaxed in this country all along.
R:  But what's happened to our country that we're so vulnerable to terrorism?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I mean, how did we become so vulnerable?  We weren't -- I -- okay, let me s- -- I guess we were all naive --
L:  Yes --
R:  -- to the fact that we were vulnerable.
L:  -- and then, too, y-, uh, you'd think a lot of this, too, is, uh, maybe intermarriages.  Marrying foreign people and bringing 'em over here on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on your -- you know.
R:  Well, sometimes that's done for money ...
L:  Yes.
R:  ... by a -- by an American citizen --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because they know that, you know ...
L:  They'll get paid so much to marry these people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or to give 'em a green card and whatever.
R:  W- -- e- exactly, and that's what brings --
L:  And I think we're, uh, out of line whenever we feed and clothe these foreign people, give 'em medical assistance, when we can't even do it for our own.
R:  [LAUGH] Thank you, when we have children who are in our education system --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that have thirty two children in a classroom with one teacher.
L:  That's right.
R:  When we have homelessness, when we have poverty, when we have illnesses and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, the -- the likes of this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we're ...
L:  I'm just living in a little bitty small town.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it's a rural area.
R:  Right.
L:  But the drugs are everywhere.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [MN]
L:  Where did they come in from?
R:  Mhm, Columbia. [LAUGH]
L:  Wher- where did they start from?
R:  Right, right --
L:  There's -- there --
R:  -- it all started somewhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  When I was ten years old and twelve years old it wasn't rampant like it is now.
L:  No, no.
R:  I mean --
L:  And now it's the meth labs that we're dealing with.
R:  [MN] In your next door neighbor's home.
L:  That's right, that's right.  And you've gotta be alert at -- all the time.
R:  And -- but you know what?  They're terrorists as well.  Because once that meth lab explodes --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- it takes the whole neighborhood down with it.
L:  That's right.  And I'm a -- I'm a widow.  My husband will be gone three years in July and --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- it just terrifies me to think ... you know, at night I close the doors and I lock 'em but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is that lock going to protect me?
R:  Ultimate- --
L:  Not if they want in.
R:  Ultimately, no.
L:  Not if they want in.  It just --
R:  No.
L:  -- makes you a little more secure.
R:  Ri- -- well, y- -- it gives you a false sense of being more secure because, quite honestly, my husband locks the doors all the time and I tell him, "David, if they're coming in, they don't care about the locks on the doors".
L:  No, because I've got two windows right on the front porch; all they'd have to do is through something --
R:  Mm, break one out.
L:  -- through the window and climb in.
R:  Right.  And my own brother used to break into my grandmother's home at two thirty in the morning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean -- and she did those same things.  She locked the doors, she put stuff in front of the windows and stuff.  So, [MN] you know ...
L:  Yeah, it's doesn't keep 'em out.
R:  No, nothing keeps 'em out, but it's the same with the terrorists.
L:  But you've -- you've got to kinda just -- when you go somewhere, kinda know your surrounding and don't be alone going to a car or nothing anymore.
R:  You can't.  You can't afford --
L:  No.
R:  -- to this day and age.  Not at all, but --
L:  No, I always take someone with me, you know, when I go.  I traveled up to my son's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which was only a hundred and forty seven miles.  I took my sister with me.
R:  Did you? [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  Because I didn't want to be on the road alone.
R:  By yourself.  Yeah, I find that scary.  I've often wanted to go up and visit my grandparents in Georgia but I'm afraid to go alone --
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  -- because I'm terrified.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm terrified of what's -- you know, who's out there.  If I stop to get gas, who's jumping in the car and following me?
L:  That's -- yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Y- -- I -- I -- you know, I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- feel safe.
L:  No.
R:  But, like I said, nine one one -- nine eleven has put us on our toes, it has --
L:  Oh, it sure has.
R:  -- made us so more heightened -- our awareness is more heightened.
L:  And just like the song Do You Remember?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That I think is the greatest song that man ever could have written.
R:  Really?  I haven't heard it yet I don't -- no, I haven't heard it yet.  Uh --
L:  D-, uh, Darryl Worley sings it.
R:  I -- it's fairly new, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, I've heard --
L:  It's a country and western song and it's Do You Remember?
R:  Oh, it's country and western.  I don't listen -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Oh, it's a beautiful song.
R:  Really?
L:  You oughta listen to it.
R:  Yeah, now I'll have to go on line on my computer and check it out --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and see.
L:  He -- he was a nominated last night but he didn't get it.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  No, he was a nominated but he didn't get it.  But the one did -- on one of the +patriotic --
R:  R- --
L:  -- songs, you know.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, good.  Well, at least they recognize that somehow because, let's face it, I mean, my sister --
L:  Well, they even had some of the ones that was captured, that was, uh, brought back.
R:  [MN]
L:  The woman got shot in the feet and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Three of them was in the audience and they brought 'em on stage.
R:  Were they really?
L:  Yes, at Las Vegas.  Yes they did.
R:  Oh, man!  I would have watched it just for that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- even though I hate country music.
L:  I mean, it was on there.  They -- they brought 'em on stage --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think that's --
L:  -- and whenever they sang Do You Remember? --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Darryl Yor-, uh, Worley sang it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and those servicemen was in the audience; they showed the camera.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Every one of 'em knew the words --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they sang right along with him.
R:  N- -- aw.
L:  Yes.
R:  That's awesome.  I understand that the gentleman that helped --
