R:  Hello.  Th- --
L:  Hello.
R:  This is Kerene[?].
L:  Yeah.  Hi, this is Cindy Hill[?].
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This is my first call.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  This is my first call too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, cool.  Okay.  All right.  So, we're supposed to talk about smoking?
L:  Yep.
R:  Okay.  Well, um, I personally don't smoke and I, um, agree and like that it is banned from public areas --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I -- you know, I don't mind if people smoke outside and stuff but when I go into restaurants or airplane flights and things like that, I definitely like it where it -- there is no smoke.
L:  Oh, I'm a smoker.
R:  You're a smoker?
L:  Yes and a heavy smoker too.  So --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I don't like when it's banned. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know I saw a lot -- I -- I actually saw a lot of, ah, places shut down -- well, a couple of, ah, local like bars that opened up around my area that are shut down because they didn't allow smoking, you had to go outside.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I know a lot of people -- like when we go to group, ah, birthday outings and stuff like that, you know, I know a lot of my family doesn't smoke but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we -- some places you have to sit in -- a bar, is the only place you can smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's hard to get a table to fit everybody or have to put a bunch of them together --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I personally -- I mean, I don't mind the [SIGH] smoking and non smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I just -- just still -- I think there -- [several inaudible words] right to smoke and I know it's dangerous and [SIGH] killing everybody. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And it's cost a lot of money.
R:  Yeah.  Well, if they could -- if they could really separate it, because you know that -- you know, when -- when before I would walk into restaurants where it was, you know, a smoking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or a non smoking section, it doesn't seem like it was, you know, really that separated.  So, if there was a way that they could truly separate it or get like a benner -- better ventilation or something like that, then -- then yes, I agree that people have the right to smoke, but it just -- you know, it's -- I don't -- I don't care to smell it on myself when I leave or, you know, just be inhaling that.  And I know that there's a lot of concerns too for the waitresses, so you would probably to order -- ah, hire separ- separate waitresses to do that.
L:  Well, yeah I see what you mean.  I don't see how it, ah -- you know, if you're smoking and you ask for a non smoking section, I don't see how that really doesn't affect you as much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I [several inaudible words] smoke -- you know, they're blowing it in your face --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or to your table or whatever, but I -- I don't see how it, ah -- you know, I mean, if there's smoking in there, it's either smoking or not smoking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, when you go into a restaurant.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Because if they have a smoking section, then you're going to smell it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, even though someone's not lighting up at your table.
R:  Maybe just, um -- I don't know if they, you know, could have restaurants or something like that that would just -- you know, just -- only particular ones would allow it and so you would -- if you were just a non smoker just --
L:  [NOISE] I think that means our times up.
R:  Does that mean our time is up? [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's what that means.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so if we want to leave any comments or anything, what are we supposed to do?
L:  I think, um, it comes -- that someone comes on and ask you -- I'm not sure really, how that works.
R:  Oh, me neither.
L:  It went real fast.
R:  Yeah, it did.
L:  It did, didn't it?  That's what I thought too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought it went -- I thought it went really a little bit too fast --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] just caught me off guard.  The phone rang --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it was raining I had to get my dog in and the phone was ringing, I went to grab it and it was just like caught me off guard.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know if we just hang on for a minute and it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe we don't.  Maybe we just hang up and that's, ah -- I think that's your call.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't know --
R:  You know what, it's not --
L:  -- I just got an email from them today and I printed it out but I haven't even looked it at yet.
R:  My phone only says we've been on the phone for five minutes, so --
L:  [several inaudible words] says ten does it?
R:  -- I don't know -- yeah, we're supposed to talk about it for ten --
L:  We're supposed to wait ten minutes?
R:  -- so, I think we should probably keep talking about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I think so.
L:  Y- you know what, I think so too, because I think that was my ans- answering machine thing button that did that.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, anyway -- so [SIGH] if they could -- if they could truly separate it -- you know, I don't like to take that right away from people and things like that because that is your own personal choice, but you know, if it's going -- if it's in a situation where it's going to be affecting those people that don't, ah, choose to participate then -- then that shouldn't be there.
L:  Right.  Well, there's so many government programs with it now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, what are they -- um -- I mean, you know, where you just can't smoke in any government facilities and -- I mean, you know, a lot of people do still smoke, I know a lot of people don't and it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's so addictive and, you know, I see a lot of the new ads they have on TV about how, um, the major cigarette companies are, um, you know, lying to you, like that wouldn't kill you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know and they'll say like, "My father's dead now or died last year with lung cancer" you know and stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is really sad, but you know when I see those young kids up there doing these ads --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I think it is a deterrent, you know, carding 'em, making 'em show ID even, you know, if you don't look like you're over thirty or thirty five, you know, to get --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, same thing with, ah, drinking, with alcohol --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I kind of think, not all of it goes but a lot of people that drink, I think, smoke too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  When it comes to alcohol, but not necessarily.  Like, my father quit, you know, when he was twenty five and he's never smoked since so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and I know a lot of people that have just quit, just up and quit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- cold turkey.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Which -- I wish I could do it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I, um -- you know, I -- I've talked to some, um, people who smoke and things like that and most of them do, they want to quit but it is so hard.  My father in law, um, smokes but he's really gracious about it and goes outside and -- and stuff like that, so it doesn't affect you but um --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- anyway.
L:  That's really considerate.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it is and -- and, you know, I think that that's the way it should be, is whoever is smoking just be considerate of those around you and then it, you know, wouldn't be such a huge issue.
L:  But it seems like every- everything in every day life is -- is about whether you smoke or not.  I mean, when it comes to -- you know [several inaudible words] like if you want to sell something on Ebay, it's, you know, "Do y- -- did it come from a non smoking household?".  Well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] I mean, people I'm sure somewhere smoked when it got delivered to that store somewhere, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, how are they going to know whether it's -- well, I'm sure if it was a product that's not in a box, you know, and you're smoking a lot it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the yellow gets on there, um --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I just -- I don't know how they can control it.  But I know they have so many government regulations that [SIGH] it's unbelievable --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when it does come to smoking.
R:  Well, I think that they really too to -- to stop what you were saying before all of those promotions and things like that [several inaudible words] glamorize and make smoking attractive and -- and get our young people off of it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know and I know -- I just -- -- I -- you know, seeing those ads on TV like MTV and stuff I'll -- sometimes you come across those ads [several inaudible words] you know, "Such and such company, ah, you know, lied to us and my father died last year" you know and -- and -- and it's really sad to see that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I mean there's so many things in life that will kill you. [LAUGH]  You know, I mean --
R:  Yeah, and I think that some of their ads are pretty graphic --
L:  I think it's a choice.  I actually think it's a choice.  I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I say, "I can't quit.  I'm addicted".  I think anybody can quit anything if they wanted to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Some people have more willpower to do it than others but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I think smoking is a choice.  You e- -- you want to smoke, you don't want to smoke.  If you want to go somewhere and you -- you know there's people smoke and you don't like smoke, then don't go around them. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you have a choice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know [several inaudible words] ride with them in your car that smokes or you can request, "Don't smoke in my car" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know and you want to go on the three hour long ride somewhere and you're like, "Oh, I wish I wasn't riding with that person" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?  "Because I want a cigarette". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess it just depends on, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the choices you make.  You know, if you choose to smoke --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I just think you could quit it.
R:  So -- so, as a smoker you think it -- um, do you feel like a hassle?  I mean, are you --
L:  Ah, sometimes it is.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  You know?
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Sometimes it can be, um --
R:  Yeah, that you're limited --
L:  -- you know, and a lot of times -- and there are so many places that don't have -- I -- I walk into a lot of places or up to places smoking a cigarette --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I'm going to be, and -- and there's an ashtray table and you see all these cigarette butts all over the ground --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I did get pulled over for throwing a cigarette butt out too.  I never throw cigarette butts out my window [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my cigarette ashtray was full and I was at a red light and a police officer was behind me and I -- I just flicked it out of the window because it went out only --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know how -- well, you probably don't know --
R:  No, I don't. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but they go out in your ashtray sometimes when you set em down, you don't smoke em --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for awhile they'll go out and when I went to smoke it it was already out so I just -- I don't, out of reaction --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I just [SIGH] and, um, that's two hundred and fifty dollars --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- ticket, for one cigarette butt.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I did- -- he didn't give me a ticket, because he saw my car [SIGH] and it's full of cigarettes.  It's not like I -- and it just -- I don't know I just [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because the cigarette -- I -- you know, I went to smoke it and it burned out on me, so I just -- my window was cracked and I threw it out for some reason --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but you know I know that police will do -- give you -- and that's a high fine for throwing out a cigarette butt.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because it somebody throws out a paper cup, [several inaudible words] I guess they get the same fine, but with the cigarette, you know, it can --
R:  Well, I guess it could be more potentially dangerous if it wasn't completely out.
L:  Well, I think -- someone told me that lives in California that they have really strict laws and if you -- they catch you throwing out a cigarette butt --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when it's, um, the dry season and it's going to rain -- I mean, it's going -- you know, they have a lot of forest fires and stuff in certain states, that it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's a really high fine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You really get burned --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you, ah, throw a cigarette because yeah, they don't always go out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And you can, ah, start a forest fire --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- which is a -- dangerous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But not -- not here -- um, in the state I live in -- [several inaudible words] I don't know of any, ah, [inaudible] laws like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's a fire hazard but
