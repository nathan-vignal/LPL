L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello, this is John West here, how are you today?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?  My name is Angie[?].  [LAUGH]  So where are you from?
R:  I'm calling you from Laurel, Maryland, or they're -- they set it up.  I'm --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Well I'm, um, I'm in Lexington, Georgia.  [NOISE]
R:  Georgia.
L:  Yeah, huh.
R:  I talked somebody from A- Atlanta just a little bit ago.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's neat.  [LAUGH]  Oh, well, I'm not a smoker, but my mother is, so, I guess I have mixed feelings on it.  I wish she would stop smoking, but [LIPSMACK], uh, I don't -- [SIGH] I don't know, I guess I just feel if you choose to smoke that's your right and you should be able to -- I -- I think that public places still should offer smoking sections or -- for people.
R:  Well, see now, I don't.
L:  You don't?
R:  No, I don't, because -- and I'll say the reason why.  Fir- first I'm dead set against smoking, uh, I tried it just, uh, outta curiosity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I was like, ten years old --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my father told me all about it and he was saying he didn't think it was a good idea.  But he did smoke.  And I thought, "Well, gee" you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's not like one of these things like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, some kids, they don't do it and then they gotta go check it out, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  And I thought, "Uh, [MN] it doesn't seem like anything that interests me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I -- I don't see anything I like about it".  But what's funny is, I had made my own -- when I was like ten years old I had made my own little, uh, pipes out of acorns.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And you used like, a little straw you found it in a weed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  And then I put the corn silk -- but see, I never inhaled that.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh okay.
R:  And I'll tell you something really funny was, see here I'm just a ten year old kid --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm down there in the -- in the field and I started smoking and puffing away this, and I didn't mean to inhale it, and I accidently inhaled it.  Well, it made me so dizzy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it scared me and I ran home --
L:  [LAUGH] That's cute.
R:  [LAUGH] Isn't that funny?
L:  That is funny.  That is funny.  Yeah, I think smoking is awful for you, and I've been trying to get my mother to stop, but --
R:  Well, I think you should, in --
L:  I haven't had much success.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well let me -- let me tell ya, I think you should, and you know why?  I mean, if you really care about your money -- your mother --
L:  Mhm.
R:  For her sake, you should, because, just give ya an example, my father, uh, how old are you now, if I might ask?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm thirty six.
R:  Okay.  But I'm sixty five.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I lost my father.
L:  Oh.  [NOISE]
R:  And I tell you, it's mainly because of smoking.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, my mom [NOISE] already, um, [NOISE] she [NOISE] coughs really bad in the mornings, and I know she's [SIGH] she already sounds like she has emphysema to me, but, um --
R:  She -- I tell you, you should, uh --
L:  [NOISE] But she smoked since she was probably thirteen.
R:  Yeah, well you should get on her, I think, like ugly on an ape.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?  Because, and then -- the man that I just talked to, probably two hours ago, and he's from Atlanta, he said his father died because of smoking.
L:  Mm.  That's awful.
R:  And he said he -- his father was like, three hundred and fifty pounds --
L:  Gosh.
R:  -- and he got down with lung cancer to a hundred and fifty before he died.
L:  Mm.
R:  And he said --
L:  That's awful.
R:  -- it was really, really awful.  And my father, uh, he had two +heart operations and the doctor told me, his surgeon, he says, "The w- -- the reason his +heart -- his heart is the way it is, is because of cigarettes".
L:  [NOISE]  Mm, see, that's awful.
R:  So -- it is.  And -- and the thing is, I will admit that I like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on a rare occasion, I've got to the point like -- like, maybe once every five years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- smoke a cigar.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  There again, I don't -- I don't inhale it, I just like the smell of it a lot.
L:  Right.
R:  And my grandfather and my father both smoked, uh, cigars but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I like them, but the cigarettes, I hate the smell of 'em and I --
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I -- I hate what it does to the people, and the reason I don't think that they should have it in any restaurants or any public places is because you are being subject to that against your will.
L:  Well, that's true, that's true.
R:  And --
L:  And secondhand smoke is really bad.
R:  And when I go to these restaurants that have smoking too, my wife and I have bought a book, uh, called Entertainment, and you get to go to these restaurants, and you get one entree free --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- and you pay for one.  So the book pays for itself.  Well, we took another couple that they also got the book.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And we go to this place, and it's like a, uh, you know, they'd -- they'd say it was like a red neck place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not that -- not that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not that we knew that that's what it was gonna be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it -- it was a lotta young people in there, and it was a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was like an extended sized bar --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they -- and I -- and I said, "Where's this --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- non smoking section?  You know, I wanna be deep into that"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they said, "Oh, over here".  Well, you could smell that just as easy as pie.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That stuff just blows over.
L:  Oh.
R:  The only way they would protect you, and not -- and -- and would be is if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they had some type of ventilation system that it would --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- suck the smoke right smack and blow it out.  Well, they're not gonna pay for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I'm -- I'm like, you know, and they didn't ask me.  If they -- if they did --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- I'd tell 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm never gonna go to their restaurant again.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I don't -- I -- I -- I would put it down, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's true [NOISE].  I don't blame you, that is true.  And I -- I think the, um, non smoking campaigns and ads on TV are really good.
R:  I do too.
L:  I like the new ones they have for children --
R:  Well, sure.
L:  -- and teenagers.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I have no use for the cigarette companies, because you can see now where it's proof that they have shown where they had actually grown tobacco that was higher in nicotine --
L:  Right.  To get people addicted.
R:  -- and claimed that they didn't, and they did this just to get people more hooked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they targeted children like that, uh --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- Camel cigarettes.  And kids are really susceptible to that, they think --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  "Oh, this is big stuff", you know.
L:  Our schools, um, here, have banned like, uh, teenagers wearing the T. sheets with [NOISE], um, [NOISE] the Camel thing on it and --
R:  Good for them.
L:  -- stuff like that.  So, yeah.
R:  I think that's a real good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do.
L:  Me too.
R:  And another -- another thing is, uh, what was I gonna say?  I mean, it used to be, you'd be on a plane.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they finally stopped that.  But I mean --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I- in --
L:  That is -- yeah, that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that would be awful, to be on --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- a plane with, mhm, yeah.
R:  And when I -- when I worked for Pepsi Cola, here we'd have a meeting, and they, you know, they were like, smoke 'em if you ha- -- if you got 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of stuff.  Well that's crazy, I mean, there must have been thirty of us guys and probably I'm one of three that didn't have any use for smoking, and I didn't wanna be in there, and +actually, you know, it looks like a gray cloud in there.
L:  Right.
R:  And you're in there for a half hour, in that stuff, breathing it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh --
L:  And then you stink.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you have to go home and bathe, yeah.  Yep.  So I -- I am -- I'm working with my mom really hard, trying to get her to quit.  [MN]
R:  I think you --
L:  So --
R:  You wanna take her to the hospital and let her see some of those people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with lung cancer and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and coughing up blood and everything.
L:  That's true.
R:  Maybe it would scare her?
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it is awful.  It really is.  Oh.
R:  But I've heard of -- I heard telling people it was so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They had to have it so bad that they had had an operation on their +larynx because of it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and yet -- where they had that little hole there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where they could breathe through their neck?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They were actually trying to smoke through that.
L:  Oh my God!  That's awful.
R:  And you think well, people --
L:  Ugh!
R:  -- would have better sense than that.
L:  Yeah.  But it's [NOISE] -- I think it is a drug, like you say, that people just get addicted to, and have a really hard time giving up.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, so the tobacco companies are [COUGH] -- you know, ought to be ashamed of themselves.
R:  Sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and the thing is, it's a -- it's a real drug because I remember when my father had, uh, smoked, he said he really liked it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Whereas I didn't like it at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't like the smell or anything of the cigarettes, I loved the cigar smell, but I didn't like the other part.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- but just to give an example of -- it's a -- it's a kind of a depressant type of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think, uh, my father was a policeman, and he w- -- he worked three tricks of duty in all kinds of weather and stuff for years, and I really think he smoked because of the tension of the job.
L:  Probably so.
R:  You know, you're under such pressure, and he just probably did that to kinda almost dull his senses, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm, that's true.  And I'm sure when -- I'm -- I think too, probably, in when he was, you know, in his prime or whatever, most -- everybody did smoke at that time.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.  [MN]
R:  That's it.  See, when people were younger they didn't know how bad it was.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But now that we do, there's no excuse.
L:  That's true.
R:  And another thing is, uh, as much as I like the smell of cigars, huh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my father, huh, he got to smoking these -- and I mean, they were really strong ones -- and we'd go down to his house, my wife and I, and I'd -- I'd say, "Dad", I says, "Man, you gotta cut those cigars out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I says, "You're killing us.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, how can you stand the smell, it's so strong?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've got a beautiful, beautiful lamp that he made, and what he had found in the w- -- in the -- in the -- I think it was on his property maybe, uh, was where, I think it was a, uh, [LIPSMACK] it was one kind of a small tree, we'll just say maybe the diameter of the tree --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was about three inches.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And somehow this -- it was either a sassafras or holly, or whatever it was, had wrapped itself around it.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  So that it was a spiral shape.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that was probably about the diameter of, oh about, oh, maybe as much as five inches.
L:  Wow.
R:  He cut that off at the top and the bottom, and he put the bottom on a beautiful piece of black walnut, real thick, uh --
L:  Oh, how pretty.
R:  And then he made a l- -- he gotta lamp out of, it was like, burlap type --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or something like tweed like.  To that -- to this day --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- if it's real rainy, like it is now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I can go over near it and I can actually smell the
