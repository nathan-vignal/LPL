L:  Hey, Lesley[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Linda from Texas. [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello. [LAUGH]
R:  Where you from?
L:  Um, Michigan.
R:  Michigan? [NOISE] How do you feel about smoking? [MN]
L:  Um, well, I have a- allergies and asthma, and I really don't like smoking.
R:  Jeeze, so do I.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I can't be around cigarette smoke.
L:  Oh, I can't either, and it really irks me when I pull up to a traffic light, and someone's smoking in the car next to me and I have my window down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because of a sudden, the smoke's in my car --
R:  [SIGH] Y- --
L:  -- and I never used to notice it before, but I've noticed it more lately.
R:  Mhm.  Uh, my husband goes -- has to go into the VA Hospital in Dallas and you're not allowed to smoke in the building, but when you come out of the building, there's no smoking signs, but all these people are round there smoking.
L:  Yeah, it's the same thing at the hospitals around here, when you walk out the door --
R:  We have a couple in here --
L:  -- there's nurses outside smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we have a couple in here that are -- are completely no -- no smoking anywhere on their property --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is nice.
L:  Yeah.  The hospital I used to work at was the same way --
R:  I can tell when, uh, the --
L:  -- you could not smoke on the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the property.
R:  I can tell even when a nurse has been smoking on break.
L:  Oh, definitely.  I -- I believe that non smokers, we can just pick up on it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- very easily.
R:  My -- and my son in law smokes, and I can tell -- he doesn't smoke in my house [LAUGH].  I have a sign on my refrigerator, "If -- if there's smoke in this house, it better be on fire".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's cute. [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, I -- I li- -- had a, uh, Woman's Day magazine the other day and soon as I opened it up, the first page was an advertisement for cigarettes.
L:  Ah, talking about mail, our mailman smokes, and our mail comes in the house smelling like smoke.
R:  He shouldn't be allowed to --
L:  It's unbelievable.
R:  Yeah, he shouldn't be allowed to do that.
L:  I guess he figures there's nobody in the car -- in, um, um, truck with him, so he can do what he wants.
R:  The kid -- I think the kids are going to smoke, I don't care what advertisements, especially if their parents smoke, they're going to smoke.
L:  A- and I know quite a few s- -- or kids who smoke in our neighborhood whose parents don't even smoke.
R:  Hm.
L:  It seems like there's more kids smoking now than there were ten years ago --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in our area, anyway.  And -- and we're in a upper middle class area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of Michigan and it's unbelievable how many of these kids are smoking --
R:  And I --
L:  -- and -- and all the --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- um, information that is out there and they're -- they're smoking more than they did.
R:  I know.  But, uh, you know, in defense of the tobacco companies, I don't think that people should be allowed to sue them though, because they did not twist their arm --
L:  No, that's true.
R:  -- to smoke that cigarette.
L:  I mean, it [SIGH] --
R:  You know, just like the ice cream company doesn't make me eat my ice cream.
L:  That's right.  It's -- it would be the same as suing McDonalds --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for making you fat.
R:  And --
L:  I don't think that they have the right to sue the tobacco companies.
R:  Yeah.  But, uh, I mean, I don't know how old you are, but when I was growing up, we had candy cigarettes.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  I'm in my -- I just turned fifty.
R:  And that came -- it used to come in in a little box and the tips were red and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't even have that any more.
L:  They don't? [LAUGH] I know they have candy cigars. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, Dallas just made, uh, just about all of Dallas, you cannot go into a restaurant and smoke any more.
L:  Well, they still have non smoking sections in the restaurants in Michigan.
R:  No, they don't here.
L:  And that -- and that upsets me because they'll put 'em right by the, uh, the wait area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So you have to walk through that area to get to the non smoking --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- which seems unfair.  They should put --
R:  And there's usually a line for the non smoking area.
L:  Pardon?
R:  There's usually a wait for the non smoking.
L:  Oh, right.  If you say you're a smoker, you can get a table right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- away.
R:  But, you know, the mayor of Dallas, she went through a lot of f- flak though, for pushing this non smoking.  You can't even smoke in a bowling alley or a bar.
L:  Yeah, that's like in New York, then.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's one reason I don't bowl.  I would love to bowl, but the smoking alley where I live, they smoke.  Uh, we're in a little town outside of Dallas, so they smoke in, you know, [SIGH] in the bowling alley, and if it's a -- a little place, like maybe the waffle house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they smoke.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I told him, if he ever quits the smoking, I might --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- think about joining.
L:  We go into, like, a pizza parlor around here and the -- the, um, um, non smoking area is much larger than the smoking area, and you still come out with your hair smelling like smoke.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] Did --
L:  But it -- it just sticks to you.
R:  And the cost, my God.  Wh- what is it, it --
L:  Yeah, in Michigan it's about right around six dollars, seven dollars a pack of cigarettes.
R:  Oh, my God.  I don't see how anyone could afford it.
L:  I -- I can't either.  It's just --
R:  [NOISE] That's a lot of money.
L:  It's [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] For me it is. [LAUGH]
L:  Figure out, some of these people who are chain smokers, they're smoking two -- two packs a day.
R:  Mm.
L:  At, you know, six or seven dollars.
R:  Yeah.  How did you hear about this, uh, Fisher study?
L:  Um, on the internet, uh, o- on a mystery shopping website.
R:  Oh, mystery shopping?  Do you go to Refunding Makes Cents?
L:  No.
R:  It's a refunding site, that's where I heard about it.
L:  Yeah, I thought it was something nice to look into.
R:  Yeah, i- i- it's different.  I talked to a gentleman, uh, the other day from New Orleans.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, it's kind of nice, you know, get -- get your opinions out, we were talking about movies and -- and then when I heard that today was smoking, I thought, "Well, that would be a good one for me, because I'm totally against it". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I am too.  I just --
R:  [MN]
L: -- because, you know, you don't even have to be a smoker, and I -- I heard something on -- on a local TV station, that they -- one study showed that, um, secondhand smoke doesn't cause cancer, and I don't believe that.  I think that they need to do more study on that, because they had a bunch of studies before that said it did.  I think that sometimes these cigarette companies jump in and say, um, you know, "Here's our study" and they said that the study was funded by [LAUGH] the cigarette makers.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, it -- you know, I wouldn't believe that study.
R:  Well, my medicines and stuff cost me too much to be around anyone that smokes.
L:  Well, me too, me too.
R:  I -- I use A- A- Adair now [NOISE] -- I mean, Advair.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's fifty something dollars each time.
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I take, um, Singular and, um, I have to take my inhaler.
R:  Well, I just got off of a month of it, of, uh, Cortisone.
L:  Oh, and I -- I -- and that Cortisone has messed up my bones, has made me, uh, crippled --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- it's, uh --
R:  Every time I tell him, "I'll die before you give it to me again" but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I always end up taking it and it -- this last time I got a big bad rash underneath my arms after I went off of it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- you know, I -- I've seen people who've -- who've had lung cancer, you know, who were -- who were heavy smokers all their life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and right -- right up until they find out they have cancer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're smoking, you know, like two packs a day, three packs a day, then all of a sudden they -- they wanna quit, and it's, like, you know, you've got six months to live and you're gonna quit?  It's not gonna make a difference.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] N- not then. [LAUGH]
L:  But, wow, yeah.
R:  They waited too long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My father smoked.
L:  Yeah, my parents did too, and I -- I never even tried it.
R:  My father had a pack in his pocket when he went to the hospital with a heart attack.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he -- he had black lung too. [NOISE]
L:  My -- my father didn't die of -- of lung cancer, but I have a sister who was, um, she just turned sixty years old and she passed away.  Um, and she had lung disease and they didn't say it was cancer, but she got these pockets in her lungs and they told her, "You can't smoke any more" and she kept on smoking, she smoked 'til the day she died, she'd take her oxygen off and she'd go out th- the front --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- door and she'd have a cigarette and come back in and put her oxygen back on.
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, uh, we had a friend whose husband quit smoking and she just want, uh, well, she said she wanted to quit.  She's gone through every kind of, uh, treatment and hypnosis, you name it, she's done it to quit smoking --
R:  Well, from what I understand --
L:  -- but her desire isn't strong enough.
R:  Yeah, I -- but that's what I understand, is that you have to want to.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- I -- I think she enjoys it too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, uh, she can't -- well, it's not that she can't --
R:  I have a sister, she's the only one in the family that smokes and she came down to visit me and -- and I told her, you know, sh- she just can't smoke in the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So she'd go out on the porch and smoke, but after she left, when I went into the room she was staying in, I could smell smoke, and I opened the window and I could tell she had been standing at the window, smoking.
L:  My -- my children -- my youngest one, um, he had asthma really -- really bad.  He started when he was only, like, six months old, having to go in the hospital, um, we never allowed smoking in our house --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I had family members and my husband had family members that smoked back then and they -- they knew better, they didn't even try smoking at our house.
R:  My husband was in the Navy and he never smoked.
L:  Well, my husband didn't smoke when we got married, and he went to Vietnam --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he came back a smoker.
R:  Mhm.  Does he still smoke?
L:  No, no, no.  He -- he quit years and years ago.
R:  Yeah.  But it -- it c- --
L:  And he never smoked in our house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He -- he would smoke --
