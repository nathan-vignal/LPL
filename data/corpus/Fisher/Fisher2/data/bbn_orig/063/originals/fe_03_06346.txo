R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  I'm Jaclyn[?] [inaudible]
L:  I'm Terri[?].
R:  Hi, Terri. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I hope you can hear me okay, I'm on my cellphone.
R:  Yeah, so am I, so I can hear you fine. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Uh, have you ever smoked, Jaclyn?
R:  I actually have not.  How about yourself?
L:  I was a smoker for thirty years.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And I actually stopped about, mm, I stopped in ninety four.
R:  Okay.  Interesting.  Yeah, my -- my Dad was a smoker but, uh, but my Mom -- my Mom wasn't, but my Dad was and, uh, yeah, it -- it -- I just pretty much grew up with it and not, uh, didn't really have an opinion until probably I -- I got to be married and out on my own, but, um, I -- I kind of think that smoking -- that banning smoking in public places is a -- is a good push and I -- I -- I hope the deterrents work, I have three children, so I hope the deterrent ads work. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure how much the ads and all really -- they didn't have any impact on my decision not to smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What made me stop smoking was that it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it actually became such an inconvenience.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know, on my job, I was on the eighth floor.  In order to smoke, I had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to go outside and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- trying to get down stairs to find time to smoke, it just became so much of a hassle.
R:  Right. [NOISE] Right.
L:  But, you know, I -- I'm not sure how much the print ads help, but I really think when you ban it, and you make it more difficult for people to smoke, it helps more than the actual seeing the ads.  Uh, I'm not that familiar with Quit Net, I've seen the advertisements on TV, and I'm not so sure how much the support [MN] really helps a person to stop smoking.  For me, it just came to a point, I just made up my mind I wasn't going to do it anymore.
R:  Right, yeah. [NOISE] And I -- I think that's what you have [NOISE] to do, personally, to get to that point, I have -- my -- my Dad kinda got the same way, you know, it was too much of a hassle to go outside and if it was raining and, you know, just too much of an inconvenience.
L:  Yeah, that -- that's really what it was for me, and it -- it just -- and -- and that, and the fact that it became so expensive, and I started --
R:  Right.
L:  -- thinking about --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what else I could be doing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- with that money. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I could have a nice trip on that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.
L:  But it -- it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just -- it was such a hassle and, you know, it doesn't bother me now to be around people that smoke and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when I stopped smoking I didn't become one of those people that got on everybody's cases about smoking --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I know, it's a personal --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- decision that you have to make.  And I did try to stop three or four times before I actually just said, "This is it.  I'm not going to do it any more".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- also started seeing a lot of people around me, I mean, my brother in law had throat cancer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that has not stopped him from smoking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my -- o- o- one of my [MN] -- I call my adopted Dads --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he had throat cancer, he had smoked for years, it did finally, you know, that's what stopped him.  But it just came to a point, it was a personal decision that it wasn't healthy, it was inconvenient, and I'm just not going to do this any more.
R:  Right.
L:  And I made up my mind to stop on my birthday.  I said, "This birthday is going to represent --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- the rest of my life". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good for you.  Good for you.
L:  And I did it.  I mean, no -- no patches, no hypnosis, no earrings, and I have friends that went through all kinds of things to try to help them quit smoking.
R:  Mm.
L:  And most of them are still smoking.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I -- I have several f- -- I have several friends that smoke and, um, one of them actually, her -- her daughter, just came to her daughter, just turned five and, um, her daughter always chewed her fingernails, so she told her when she stopped chewing her fingernails, she'd quit smoking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, uh, yeah, so of course her daughter thinks, "Oh, that's a good deal" so she quit chewing her fingernails and walked up to her one day and said, "See, Mommy, my nails grew out past the tips of my finger.  You got to stop smoking now". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I was, like -- I was, like, "Well, she called your bet on that one, didn't she?" [LAUGH]
L:  Sure did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, my godchildren used to, um, all of my godchildren used to say, "Why don't you stop smoking? --"
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- We want you to stop smoking".  Now, their -- both of their parents smoked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but for some reason, I guess they thought they could prey on my conscience easier [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so they were -- they were constantly, you know, they refused to go get cigarettes for me, if they -- I could send them to the store for anything, but if I said, "I need a pack of cigarettes", "No, I'm not --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- going to get 'em for you". [LAUGH] So, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they -- that had a big influence and I -- I would not smoke around kids.  I wouldn't smoke around little kids, I wouldn't smoke around babies, because I do believe --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- secondhand smoke is unhealthy.
R:  Yes, yes, I -- I agree wholeheartedly.
L:  And I -- I did not wanna be responsible for that, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that was the other way that my smoking became restricted, because my godchildren starting having babies and I would be around them, it was, like, "Well, I can't smoke while I'm here".
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  So, it -- it was really a decision that if I wanted to have a full and healthy lifestyle, I had to quit smoking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And i- it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- definitely been worth it.  But I know it is very difficult, that's why I don't -- you know, when people I know that smoke, even when I hear 'em say they wanna stop smoking, I just say to them, you know, "If you wanna stop, it's a decision you have to make, you have to do it.  Nobody can do it for you".
R:  Hm.  Well, good for you. [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and it -- you know, I'm -- I'm really -- when I quit, I don't think anybody in my family thought that I was going to stick to it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But a cou- couple of years after I quit, my Dad got very sick with cancer and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we nursed him and took care of him for six months until he passed and about three weeks after my Dad passed, my sister and I were sitting there talking, and she said, "You know what?  I would bet every penny I had that you will never smoke again".  I said, "Why?".  She said, "If you didn't smoke with everything we went through with Daddy, then you'll never smoke again".  And it was interesting, because I never was even tempted, whereas before, in a stressful situation, the first thing I'd do was reach for a cigarette --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and would just smoke one right behind the other.  But I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's when I knew I'd really kicked this habit.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That -- that's amazing.  Huh.
L:  Yes, it's -- it's really been hard.  But, you know, maybe for some people, the print ads, it does make a difference.  Like I said, I've seen 'em, uh, advertising the Quit Net thing over the TV and -- and I -- I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- guess a -- a lot of people do need support --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I just fe- feel like, if you make up your mind it's what you're gonna do, you just have to have the willpower to stick to it.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think that would be more of a deterrent for younger people to stop and think about the decision before they get into it.  Um, I think it's more of a deterrent maybe for younger kids than for people that are already in it trying to get out, you know?  Um --
L:  Well, I hope it makes a difference, because it looks like I'm seeing more and more kids smoking --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and buying cigarettes when I go into stores and I -- so, I sit on the porch and I watch the kids walking up and down the street, and they're just puffing away, and I'm, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, you know, yeah, if I'm going to talk to somebody about not smoking, that's who I do talk to, is the young people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because once you've done it for fifteen, twenty years, it's -- it's a devil trying to kick that habit.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know where they get their money at that age. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm telling you --
R:  I'm, like [several inaudible words]
L:  -- it is so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- expensive. [LAUGH]
R:  It is. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I can't imagine having, you know, the -- i- -- being a teenager and trying to find money for cigarettes, I --
L:  Yeah, certainly, and a pack of cigarettes costs you, like, four dollars.
R:  I -- I know.  I'd rather [inaudible] --
L:  And I think when I started smoking, I think a pack of cigarettes cost me, like, fifty five cents.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that really -- that re- -- that had a lot to do with me quitting, because it really was becoming --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- too expensive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And every time they raise taxes on something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the first thing they think about is cigarettes.  You would think they would price them out of people's habit.
R:  Right, right, you would think.  Huh.
L:  But I'm -- I'm hoping that more kids will pay attention to the ads and will listen and pe- -- and people will try to discourage them, because it really is a very unhealthy habit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't -- it's nothing attractive about it.  I mean, I remember when I was coming up, everybody you saw on TV was smoking a cigarette, it was glamorous to puff a cigarette.
R:  Yeah, glamorous, romantic, yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- I will -- I love old movies, but you do, you see every one of them in there smoking a cigarette or puffing on a cigar or something. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right, that's right.  It was the thing to do, to have this in your hand.  It looked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so cool. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, luckily the, uh, fortunately they're not showing people smoking in -- on television a- and that's why I don't understand why young people are picking this habit up.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I don't either.  I know -- I don't understand what -- what influence they're having.  I mean, I guess there's -- there are a few stars still that smoke, um, but -- and I -- not -- not a lot, not as -- not as many as -- as some, you know, like, uh, [MN], your er- -- your era evidently. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you said you've had children.  Do you t- -- how old are your children?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I have a five, a four and a two year old.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, still little.
L:  Well, you have your --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The [inaudible]
L:  But hopefully this -- this is something that -- a habit that they won't pick up.
R:  Yes, I -- I hope so.  Um, um, neither my husband nor I smoke, and yet both -- but it's funny, because both of our parents, well, his --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- both his mom and dad both smoke, but they're -- they're just like you, they said when cigarettes went up, that was it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've never smoked again, and he took 'em and, you know, said he wasn't paying any more and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he couldn't pay that either, so [LAUGH] he didn't have them.
L:  Well, you really --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I think about what I would pay for a carton of cigarettes, I could go out and buy me a wonderful meal, me and a friend ... you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I just wish that I had actually put the money away that I was spending on cigarettes.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I would have a nice little sum of money right now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But I do hope --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- I hope that they do continue to have the ads, 'cause like I said, it may make a difference for some people, and -- and, as you said, probably for the younger folk --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- if it can disc- discourage them, then it's worth it.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But it's --
R:  Yeah, and I -- I -- I think --
