L:  Ah, hi.  The name is Marilyn.
R:  Hi.  This is, ah, Miles.
L:  So, [LAUGH] this is a trip.  Oh I'm -- I -- I love the idea of the smoking ban personally.  I absolutely am allergic to smoke, and I hate smoke, and I feel it's very oppressive.
R:  Do you hate people who smoke?
L:  Well, I was on -- [LAUGH] I was on a mission for a while.  I couldn't separate the two for a while, but now it's, like, no I don't hate the people.  I just don't like the act of the, ah -- of the smoking itself.  But, I only don't like the people if they're nasty.  You know, when I was in situations where I'd ask people to stop, you know, "Can you please put it out 'cause I know a lot of allergic people?"  And then they would get nasty.  Then -- then I would get -- then I wouldn't like the person.  But, um --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- other -- but I don't care.  Um, it's just the smoke itself that's just oppressive.  And for a while -- I wouldn't go out to clubs for a while until, ah -- you know, 'cause I'd wanna go out.  And -- come home and I smell from smoke, and I can't breathe, and my chest hurts, and all that.
R:  So, you're literally a- allergic to smoke?
L:  Yeah, mhm. 
R:  I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm smoking right now.
L:  Are you?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes I am.
L:  See, but, I'm having -- I'm having trouble breathing. [LAUGH]  No -- no, I just think it's just -- it's just -- like, when I go -- and, you know, I used to go -- like, if I would go to, like, to a restaurant I'd have to -- I would have to leave a restaurant --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- 'cause it'd be annoying.  And I think if, you know, I don't mind if --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- people wanna smoke, as long as they smoke in an area where it's all smokers.  But now, that's eliminated, so -- I mean, I -- I -- I -- I like it a lot 'cause now I can easily go to places, not smell like smoke, I don't have to gag and choke and then have trouble breathing.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's -- [PAUSE]
R:  I -- I can -- I can understand your position.  It -- but, it actually has ruined my life. [LAUGH]
L:  But, how can it ruin your life?  I mean, you have other -- you can g- --
R:  'Cause I'm -- I'm addicted.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I'm addicted to cigarettes and --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I'm uncomfortable going anywhere where I can't do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I, you know --
L:  You can smoke --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- outside.  You can smoke in your apartment.  You can smoke in the ca- -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, you can smoke lots of places.
R:  I can't smoke in restaurants.  I can't smoke --
L:  No, but you can smoke outside.  You can smoke in your own house.  You can smoke in other people's homes.  I mean, there's millions of places --
R:  No --
L:  -- to smoke.
R:  -- you can't smoke in other people's homes either.
L:  Well, not if they're allergic -- or if they're a smoker you can smoke.
R:  Not even then -- not even then.  It's gotten out of hand.
L:  Well, I mean, you're killing yourself, but that's up to you.  I mean, [LAUGH] I work in hospitals --
R:  I know.  I might as well enjoy it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- though while [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm not killing myself.  The, ah, tobacco company is killing me.
L:  Oh, man.  I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sorry, that's lame.  That's -- you're blaming the tobacco companies?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] hm.  Well, I'm blaming addiction.
L:  But, who's the one --
R:  They -- well -- 
L:  -- who makes the --
R:  -- they make --
L:  -- decision?
R:  -- they make it very addictive.
L:  No.  The pe- -- well, every --
R:  Oh yes they do.
L:  Well, but everything's addictive.  The whole idea is they -- peop- -- they get us hooked on a lot of things.  But hey, you know, you have a -- you have a -- you have a choice. Like, hey, I know if I smoke it's not good and I'm gonna get addicted.  I mean, I -- I can't believe the person on TV, like -- like, when people were suing, like, 'cause they get fat.  I mean, come on, that's ridiculous.  If you -- you know, it's like the drug addicts suing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, ah, somebody because they're -- they're, like, ah -- they -- they're killing themselves.  I mean, you know, it's like they're gonna blame their dealer if they get a bad -- ah, a bad batch. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like -- it's like arresting a dealer for, ah, the, ah -- [MN] for the addictions of the -- of the -- of the neighbourhood.  That's just wrong.  Long live the dealer. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Poor guy.
L:  But, you're really, ah, blaming --
R:  Don't -- don't kill him.  Don't blame the messenger.
L:  You're blaming -- you are actually blaming the -- the cig- --
R:  I guess it is my responsibility, I guess.
L:  Of course it is.
R:  Well, that's right.
L:  That's in- -- that's, like, totally insane.  I mean, that's like --
R:  Well, but I en- -- I do enjoy it, but it -- it's also I'm -- I am very addicted.  I smoke about two packs a day or more.
L:  Yeah, but then, you have a choice.  You can get off of it if you --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- want to.
R:  But I don't want -- I -- I wanna smoke in restaurants and, ah, bars.  And, ah, you're right -- I mean, I'm -- I'm faced with, ah, a problem as a result, not to mention health problems.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, um, hm.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] But, when I started -- when I started you could smoke everywhere.  And it was just, you know, your personal choice or whatever.  And, ah, now it's changed, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --it's, ah -- so it's, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's an adjustment.
L:  See, when you become, or if you ever become a non smoker I think you'll understand the other [LAUGH] -- the other point of view.  See, I don't mind anybody that does anything.  People can kill themselves and harm themselves -- I don't care.  But, when I'm part --
R:  Why don't you care?
L:  What?
R:  Why don't you care that they kill themselves and harm themselves?
L:  Well, because that's their responsibility.  I mean, I can only do so much.  I mean, I had a sister that was a -- you know, addicted to gin[?], and she was a drug addict.  You know, she had to make the final decision, like, you know, ha, it's her choice.  You know, when you talk to an addict -- you can't talk to an addict.
R:  What was she addicted to?
L:  Ah, she was a heroin addict.
R:  Oh, a --
L:  You know?
R:  -- friend of mine just died because -- 
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- for --
L:  -- that's it.  But --
R:  -- two weeks ago.
L:  Right.
R:  Two and a half weeks ago.
L:  Now, I suppose --
R:  My best friend died.
L:  Right.  Now I sup- --
R:  And your sister?
L:  No, she's okay.
R:  She's all right?
L:  She's -- she's all -- but, I suppose see, now you get lawyer who's gonna go and -- and -- [MN] the parents can get a lawyer prob- -- I mean, this is how absurd the world is -- the parents are probably -- if it was they can get a lawyer and try to sue the dealer for killing their child.  I mean, wouldn't that be kind of messed up?  You see what I'm --
R:  What are --
L:  -- saying?
R:  -- talking about?
L:  Well, because I'm telling you about --
R:  Now you've lost your own train of thought.
L:  No.  Okay.  Here, I'm saying that things are so ridiculous --
R:  I --I -- no wait.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I presented -- I presented, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the -- the -- the dealer as a victim as an absolute joke.
L:  No, but I'm --
R:  And you -- you're --
L:  -- no -- no -- I know --
R:  -- actually -- you're --
L:  -- but I'm saying --
R:  -- going with it, like of course they should sue the dealer or arrest the dealer or anything like that.  Why not?  Why not?
L:  No, I think it's good to arrest dealers.  But, I'm saying the --
R:  But not sue them?
L:  No.  But, I'm saying the absurdity of everything is if I go and buy drugs from somebody then that's -- I can't blame anybody but myself.  I'm the one who bought them. [PAUSE]  That's what I'm saying.  I have to take responsibility for my -- for my own actions.  So, I mean, like, this guy who's trying to get -- you know, the people who were trying to sue the tobacco companies -- I mean, come on.  And then the fact that you get some asinine lawyer to actually, um, waste people's money and time to fight something that is so stupid.
R:  How old are you, Marilyn?
L:  Ah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm not twenty years old.
R:  Ah, okay.  Well, I'm thirty six.
L:  Okay.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm actually older than you.
R:  I see.
L:  Yeah.  So -- but, where -- where do you live?
R:  Are you --  
L:  [MN]
R:  I'll never see you aga- -- well, you don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I guess it's not polite to ask a lady her age.
L:  No, you never ask a lady her age.  But, where do you live?
R:  But, I mean, this is -- this is, ah, you know, a crazy --
L:  Ah, are you in --
R:  -- little ten minutes we're having.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, what do you care?  I mean, just tell me.
L:  I think it's a hoot.  But, the thing is, see you have a choice.  People have a choice. And aga- --
R:  Oh, back to the subject.
L:  Well, yeah.  I mean, the point is this; it's the same thing.  Like, you can do -- you know, I had this discussion -- my father.  I think anyone can do anything, [MN] if their -- but if their harming other people -- it's like, um, the air is polluted.  I would love to be able to sue somebody that they've destroying the environment, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Again, I don't care what anybody does, you know.  But, when it involves, ah, other people and harming other people then I'm -- I'm not for it.
R:  How about when you walking down the street and someone's smoking a cigarette?  Do you, ah, like, wave your hands?  Or, you --
L:  No, sometimes --
R:  -- know, like, to clear --
L:  -- I push the sm- --
R:  -- the air.  Or --
L:  Yeah, sometimes.  Actually I have a friend who does that too because, again he --
R:  Well, that -- that's obnoxious.
L:  Well --
R:  And that's not gonna -- that's not gonna affect your health in any way if you're walking by --
L:  No, but if I'm --
R:  -- a --
L:  -- behind --
R: -- millisecond of smoke --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- like --
R:  It's really obnoxious.
L:  Well, I don't it's obnoxious.
R:  It's rude -- it's rude.
L:  It's not rude if I'm behind somebody and the smoke comes in my face.
R:  No -- no.
L:  I push it away.
R:  But if you let them know -- if you let them know you're --
L:  No, I'm talking --
R:  -- displeased.
L:  -- about -- I'm talking about behind me, when it comes in my face -- I push it away.  I have another friend who's highly -- there's some people, like me, who -- ah, we're pretty highly allergic.  I'm, like, chemically --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sensitive to perfumes.  If someone -- you know, I was in an airplane, right?  I had to sit in the b- -- I had to stand in the back of the airplane because someone next to me had on such perfume that my e- -- ah, my eyes were tearing, my chest was tight, I had a severe headache.
R:  Has anyone ever suggested that you're a hypochondriac?
L:  Um, that's been suggested, but that's -- this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is the issue.  If you really check it out.  I'm -- I'm serious -- if you check out, like, you'll see now, like, a lot of people who are chemically sensitive.  And that's because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the environment is so polluted.  People's immune systems are getting worse and worse.  But, that's separate from the idea about when people are doing things that I feel are affecting other people and they're not conscious of it, and then they get angry.  You know, like smokers who get angry, "Well, like, fuck you.  I'm smoking.  I don't give a shit".
R:  Yeah.  But I think sometimes that they're reacting to some hostility --
L:  Well, I've asked people --
R:  -- that peop- -- 
L:  --very --
R:  -- people are so -- people feel self righteous and, ah, are maybe initiating the nastiness.  I mean, I think --
L:  Well, I mean, I've asked people in a nice way.  I mean, as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- long as everything's done really nicely, you know, and with no anger, like, "Excuse me, do you mind putting your cigarette out?  I'm allergic" or whatever.  So, I am pro -- and our time is up.  What happens now? [LAUGH]  This is my first one.
R:  [MN]
