R:  Hello, my name is Michelle.
L:  Hello, my name is Midorn[?]. [LAUGH]
R:  Midorn?  Great.  Uh, you know, nice -- nice to be talking to you.  This is, um, an interesting topic to me, [LIPSMACK] um, because I'm actually doing a little bit of research into smoking so ... good topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and I just watched the news the other night [MN] and they're talking about smoking too.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh --
L:  So, how do you feel?
R:  Well, I mean, I -- I'm -- I'm definitely against it.  Um, I'm a nonsmoker; I -- I had, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, a -- a grandparent die from emphysema, and I have a little sixteen year old sister who is smoking now.  So I'm definitely against it.  Um, after living in, uh, LA, where a good deal of the bars are nonsmoking, it's nice.
L:  Oh.
R:  How about you?
L:  Well, where we live there's no smoking in, like, restaurants.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But bars usually have 'em, smokers.
R:  Oh, n- -- in, uh, in bars.
L:  I am a smoker, but I -- I'm not -- I'm still against it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I quit for, like, two years and when my husband and I separated I smoked again and now my fourteen year old s- s- son is smoking so I'm like, "Oh, no".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm quitting so he'll quit.  I'm hoping.
R:  Are you trying to quit right now?
L:  Well, I'm -- yes.  I am.
R:  Well, yeah, you know, great [inaudible].
L:  And it's a hard thing to do so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm definitely for the programs.
R:  You know, they say that, um, you know, the more times you try, the more you'll be successful.
L:  I --
R:  So keep trying.
L:  I heard it's harder. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The withdrawals and stuff is harder.  I'm thinking, "Oh, no". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.  No, just keep -- just keep plugging at it. [LAUGH] Um, I -- I'm -- I'm doing, you know, kind of research.  You know how they have all those tobacco documents that are being released?
L:  Right.
R:  All the super secret ones.  I'm looking into that for -- for a book someone is writing about how terrible the -- the tobacco companies were in marketing to, you know, youngsters, to women, you know, exploiting people.
L:  Right.
R:  And so I -- I r- -- I really like all this pub- -- you know, publicity that's coming out, um, like the commercials.  [SIGH] Um, I don't know, what do they have in your area as far as, like, smoking prevention?
L:  There's not really much here on prevention.  I mean, all we get is what's on TV, and then just not being able to smoke in the restaurants.  It's really not talked about, like, yet.
R:  Is that -- is that new, not being able to smoke in the r- -- the restaurants?
L:  Oh, it's been about a year.  It's n- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's kind of new.
R:  Uh, I bet some people are still upset about it, huh?
L:  Oh, yeah.  My mom's been a smoker forever, and never ever plans on stopping, so she won't even go to a restaurant if she can't smoke in it.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So I'm just like, "Well, pretty soon you won't be able to go out to eat. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Not at all.
R:  That's a reason to quit. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  She won't.  No --
R:  I mean, do you ... do you think that's working, you think it's helping?
L:  Yeah, I think it cuts down, because, you know, most people that smoke, it's a habit after a while.  So, after they get done eating, they smoke.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or when they get in their cars, they smoke.  It's after a certain thing that they do.  So when you quit, y- -- that's why it's a good thing to have sugar free candies, like, hard candies, to pop in your mouth instead.
R:  Yeah, because y- you get so used to this -- this timetable that you're on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now -- now they know that --
L:  And my mom did go to American Spirits --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and she thinks they're all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- better because they don't have the nicotine.  No, they have the nicotine, they don't have the chemicals.  That's what it is.
R:  Oh, they're -- they're more healthy cigarettes?
L:  Y- yeah, that's what they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- promote because they don't have the chemicals --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just the nicotine.  Exactly. [LAUGH] They're still bad.
R:  Well -- yeah [LAUGH] I mean, not so bad, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But [MN] the n- -- the chemicals is what -- the reaction -- I guess the withdrawals are from, more than the nicotine.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  'Cause they put so many chemicals in there, and that's what causes so much of the bad -- like cancers.
R:  Yeah, they actually, you know, man- manipulate the formula so it's -- it's more addictive, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's kind of like McDonald's, um, you know, adding something to their french fries that make you crave it [LAUGH] even more, so you'll buy it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I --
L:  I feel that way about pizza. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, that's true.
L:  So, anyway ...
R:  Anyway --
L:  Prevention wise I, you know, like, if I w- -- I'm going to quit s- -- to quit smoking, the only thing I can do is go to a doctor and get on a pill or a patch, or quit on my own.  There's not really anything here that offers help.
R:  Ah.  So y- -- do -- if there was, like, a program, a free program that would -- that would, uh, help you quit, do you think that you would try it?
L:  Yeah, I think I would.
R:  'Cause I -- I think they have --
L:  You know, anything's worth -- help.
R:  -- like, something here.
L:  What?
R:  I think they have, like, a -- a toll free hotline here that you can call when you're trying to quit, now, for support.
L:  Right, see, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- something like that would be cool.
R:  Yeah.  Like, my, uh, my, you know, my brother, he -- he just quit a year ago and he's been smoke free for a year.  And now he's, you know, the world's biggest anti-smoker [several inaudible words] --
L:  Oh yeah, so was I.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Couldn't stand the smell.  "I'll get away from you, you're a smoker and you stink".
R:  Uh-huh.  But, you know, now that you're back into the habit --
L:  But that doesn't mean you don't crave it once in a while --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's the bad thing.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So I don't -- I don't think they really let you know the cravings bef- -- you know, as you're starting to smoke.  'Cause when you start it's not so pleasant, you know, y- you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you really -- you -- you do it because maybe your friends are doing it or it's cool.  [SIGH] That's why I think my little sister started --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now she's got the coughing and she feels tired and she wishes she could quit but she can't 'cause she craves it so much.
L:  Right.
R:  I think she's -- she's scared.
L:  See, and that's my problem with my son and he's ... he gets more help because he's fourteen, and he's in counseling already for depression and stuff.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So there are -- you know, he gets the support he needs, but he's still chooses to smoke 'cause it's -- probably 'cause it's the cool thing to do, for him.
R:  Well, I think that smoking helps certain, um, you know, conditions like depression, 'cause it -- it actually gives you a high and -- and it also brings down the anxiety levels, I think.  'Cause it might [inaudible] --
L:  But in the long -- in the long term, it supposedly adds to it.
R:  Well, yeah, 'cause you wo- -- you know, if you can't smoke then you become very agitated --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or if you try to quit it just makes you -- you feel worse, right?
L:  Right.
R:  And for, you know, someone with depression, um, you know, that just [LAUGH] it complicates matters, the poor guy.  [LIPSMACK] Um, I mean, you -- if you thought perhaps in his school there was more, like, anti-smoking, uh, you know ... I don't know -- [inaudible] --
L:  I think that would be a good thing for all kids in schools.
R:  Yeah.  Do you think in schools it would be effective?
L:  Other than just saying that it's not a good thing.  They should just -- they should teach 'em what the chemicals do and ... yeah.
R:  And how they've been, you know, man- manipulated, because it's actually pretty easy for, you know, these teenagers to buy cigarettes.  Why is it still so easy, when supposedly, you know, they're -- they're -- they're really conscientious about that, you know?
L:  And there's too many people out there that'll buy them for them.
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible] --
L:  That's my thing.  I'm thinking, "How do you get those?  I know you cannot go to the store and buy 'em here because you are carded.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so where do you get them?
L:  Here they take your driver's license and, like, scan it through a machine.  You kn- ... you know, I'm thirty one and I get carded for cigarettes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's no way he could go buy 'em.
R:  Well actually, uh, my sister found a place, you know, through friends, that'll sell to anybody.  They're not very strict.  And, you know, it's th- --
L:  Well, see, and those kind of people m- -- are going to get in trouble and I hope they do. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But in the meantime they're making money out of teenagers, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- selling these things so, you know, like, perhaps they -- they need more, um, [LIPSMACK] well, stricter penalties maybe, [LAUGH] for -- for -- for selling cigarettes.  I don't think they're very afraid --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause they do make so much money.  [LIPSMACK] I, uh --
L:  But those kids are under the wrong impression, you know.
R:  Well, yeah, they -- they think it's cool because it's outlawed, but they don't really understand why it's outlawed, you know.  It's the same I think with alcohol.  They don't really see how it's bad for them in the short term.
L:  Right, we can't go take 'em to a morgue and we can't take 'em to a hospital cancer ward and we [LAUGH] can't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.
R:  Although my -- my sister said, you know -- she's got these coughing troubles now.  She -- she wonders if she could look into her lungs and see what they look like, maybe that would help her. [LAUGH] I imagine they wouldn't look too good.
L:  Oh, but that's [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, somehow they would --
L:  But yeah, you know, if they could -- if they could do that, that would be cool.
R:  If they could show somebody like a young teenager with, you know, with the camera going down inside somehow, showing the lungs after just a couple of years of smoking, and put that maybe in the schools. [LAUGH] 'Cause, you know, kids are all about looking cool and -- and looking healthy.  [LIPSMACK] Maybe if they saw that their lungs looked like a -- a cigarette filter. [LAUGH] 'Cause --
L:  Yeah, but things have changed, too, where kids are not as aware, that's why there's more weight, I think.
R:  Oh, well, yeah.  Yeah, they're --
L:  And that's kind of another issue with, you know, if they don't care ... so they smoke.
R:  Yeah, so people tell them, "If you don't -- if you want to lose weight, smoke", right, cause it's good for -- for, uh, appetite control.
L:  Yeah, they can manipulate 'em in any way they want, really, 'cause it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- easy to manipulate them.
R:  Yeah, very easy to ma- manipulate teenagers.  [LIPSMACK] Um, but I -- I think we're moving in the right direction.  You know, like, um, [MN] a couple of years ago there wasn't this much out there in the community about smoking, and there wasn't really much legislation, like, banning it in bars or restaurants.
L:  Right.
R:  I know even in -- in, ah, in -- near Phoenix, Arizona, they're wanting to ban it in all public places. [LAUGH] Which I don't see, really, how they could, you know, get away with that, but it's, you know, I mean, it's definitely coming to pass, I think.  I mean --
L:  And then they keep upping the prices and upping the prices and you --
