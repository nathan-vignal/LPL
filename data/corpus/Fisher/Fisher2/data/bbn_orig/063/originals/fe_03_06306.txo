L:  Oh, hi.  My name's Rhonda[?].
R:  My name is Alison[?].
L:  Hi, Alison.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm great.
R:  Good.  This is the first, um, call I've done. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Oh, good.  I did -- I did one on Monday.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel a little --
L:  So, are you a smoker?
R:  I am an ex smoker.
L:  An ex smoker.
R:  I am.  Are you?
L:  I have never smoked.
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  So, I -- my opinion on smoking [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is rather -- that it's a very nasty, disgusting habit, to be plain honest [LAUGH] with you.
R:  Well, you know, my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uncle -- um, that I wasn't -- I didn't smoke for very long.  I -- like two years during college -- my uncle got, um, throat cancer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and my father had a heart attack.  They were both long term smokers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, after seeing that I thought, "You know --"
L:  Kind of went, "I better quit" huh?
R:  Yeah, I'm not going to, ah, pursue that. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, here -- um, I live in Texas in the Dallas Fort Worth area --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and there are, um -- I know like several of the cities around here have and one -- actually Dallas [NOISE] has just, um -- n- -- you know, the restaurants and everything are no longer able to smoke in any of them.  And for a non smoker, oh that is so great --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to not go in there, because it, ah -- and my daughter also, she has, um, just a seasonal asthma --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but smoking -- ah, being around any kind of smoking really, really has, you know, a strong effect on her.  So, even going into a restaurant where there's smoke, um, can start her into [NOISE] coughing and, you know, not being able to breathe very well.  So, I'm thrilled to death that -- that places are non smoking here now.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I certainly approve, especially for children.  I mean -- um, I think adults can choose whether or not they go into a restaurant or a bar or --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- but children can't you know --
L:  Right.  They're just kind of along for the rides, so.
R:  -- five, six, seven year old children.  Yeah, that's always, um, bothered me a lot.
L:  Yeah.  So, that to me -- that was -- I -- I think that's great.  I mean, since -- since I'm not -- a non smoker that's a great -- and plus I work, um -- well, she comes to work with me and we work at a non smoking place.  There's people here who do -- do smoke but they're not allowed to smoke inside because my boss is a non smoker.  So, we're pretty much just not around smoke, you know, hardly at all.
R:  That's great.
L:  And -- so, for us, that's a good thing.
R:  Yeah, it's great that you're teaching your children early on.  I wish my parents had, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- both of my parents were smokers.
L:  Well, see now my mum did smoke.  My mum did --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smoke when I was little for awhile.  And, I don't know, I think that that just  really -- that was a real turn off for me.  Do you have kids?
R:  No, I don't.  I --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- am, um, too young for children. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Not really, I'm twenty six so, um, I just --
L:  Well, I had her at thirty two --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I just have one.  So, you know, hey.
R:  Yeah, I'm going to wait a little longer, I --
L:  Well, I did and I'm glad.  I -- I -- I definitely -- it was a good thing. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, definitely.  I've just graduated from law school, so --
L:  Well, good for you.
R:  Yeah, I'm going to --
L:  And what state do you live in?
R:  I'm in Mississippi, not --
L:  Okay.  Mississippi.
R:  -- too far from you.
L:  Now, do they have non smoking places like they've done here? [NOISE]
R:  No --
L:  No.
R:  -- not very many at all.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I'm in a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- big college town right now.  So, everywhere --
L:  And, I mean --
R:  -- you go.
L:  [SIGH] You know, it just kind of amazes me that, um, [SIGH] -- well, as -- being a non smoker, it is a little bit hard for me when [NOISE] people who smoke when -- you know, they want to quit and I know that it's not just as easy to say, "Well, just quit" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but [NOISE]  when you're not a smoker or -- and you never have been, it is kind of hard to understand how it gets such a grasp on the people and where they can't just quit.
R:  Yeah, it's um -- it's completely mental.  It was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- once I made up my mind.  I smoked for, I think, a total of two years and -- like my sophomore and junior year of college and once I made up my mind --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it wasn't a -- a problem at all.  I just avoided the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the bar scene and all that for awh- -- until I was firmly a non smoker --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but um --
L:  I've, ah, often thought something and I don't know if this is true or not but um, I've often that -- that [SIGH] -- a- -- you know how you always see the ads for the -- you know, this patch and that and do all this stuff.  It kind of almost makes it like -- um, where if you smoke you can't quit on your own.
R:  Yeah, I didn't use any of that.
L:  Does that -- does that make sense?  It almost [NOISE] becomes like where they've drilled it into your brain that if you want to quit smoking you can't do it on your own, you have to have this and this and this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But again, that's just something that I've -- you know, I've often kind of thought that, but I don't know whether that's really the case or not but ...
R:  Well, you know, the physical withdrawals -- physical symptoms only last something like three days --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and after that it's all mental and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, so maybe the patch helps some people mentally.  They didn't ma- -- I mean, I didn't use any of it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just thought it was kind of pointless.
L:  And how long have you not been smoking?
R:  Um, three, four, five years.
L:  Five years.
R:  Mm.
L:  Did you feel better when you quit?
R:  Yes, very much so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very much.
L:  Because --
R:  I had started --
L:  -- I've heard people say that they -- they feel better, that their -- um, they can smell better and they can taste more.
R:  Taste better, yeah.  Taste was a huge -- I had noticed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably the last six months I smoked that I used a lot of salt.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  I needed a whole lot of salt to make anything taste good --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and three months after I quit I -- I quit using salt completely.  I didn't need it anymore.
L:  So, I guess maybe it kind of like numbs the taste buds or you know does some --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ha- -- or has some kind of effect on em.  But I've heard that and I've heard that they can smell, um, better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, when you quit smoking too.
R:  Yeah.  Very much so.
L:  I guess that's why a lot of times like people who have smoked for long, long periods of time and then they quit, they're like, "Oh, I just can't stand it, it's terrible" and they're worse than --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- anybody who's never smoked.  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My dad has -- um, it's been one month since his heart attack and he has not had a cigarette since.  So, I'm very proud of him and hope that he sticks with it --
L:  Stays with that.
R:  -- and he didn't use any kind of replacement nicotine or any kind of --
L:  He just quit?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I gu- --
L:  We are talking life situation here.
R:  Yeah.  The [LAUGH] --
L:  It's a -- [SIGH] you know, when you hear all of these things, I know that, you know, whatever -- um, if you want to even say -- you know, fifty years ago when people were smoking and it -- we didn't really know that it was so bad for you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but now everybody knows that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smoking is a bad, bad thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not like, "Well, we just don't know it".  And to know -- and you know, [LAUGH] you hear people that say, "Well, my grandmother smoked a pack of cigarettes every day for her whole life and she never had a problem" and sure there's people that are like that, but most of the time, I mean ...
R:  There are many more people that do have problems. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and there are a lot of compl- -- there are a lot of complications that arise from it and so it seems like, you know, the younger people who start up, you would just think, "Okay, what -- there's this whole list of bad things --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- I don't want to do that to myself".
R:  You know, we --
L:  But they don't.  It's crazy.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I took -- one of the classes I took was an employment law class and we studied --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um -- or talked about whether or not employers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- should be able to not hire or fire smokers --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and there are many studies that just th- the fiscal cost to employers --
L:  Is more.
R:  Some smoker -- yeah, much more.
L:  But you can't do that can you?  Isn't that discrimination?
R:  No, you can.  Most -- uh-huh, if your state doesn't have a state law against it, you pretty much --
L:  You can say, "No, I can't hire you.  [NOISE] You're a smoker".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Huh.
R:  Or you can fire em.  Even if they don't smoke at work, you know, smoke at home.  Yeah.
L:  Well, because I know -- you know, I mean the guys that -- that work here --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that smoke, they come inside and, you know, certainly I can smell it on em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they don't smell in here, but still when they come in I'm like, "Oh.  Ooh".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it -- it makes their area smell too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it -- it does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or -- and, ah, you know, um, like if their sit- sitting in one of their chairs and they get out and if I happen to sit in it, then I can smell it on the -- you know, we have cloth chairs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I can smell it on the chair and everything too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's -- and it's everywhere.  I mean, it's not just -- you know, it's on their clothes and it gets everywhere and --
R:  In the hair.  I know, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We, um -- my husband and I, we moved into the -- into his grandparents' house and they -- um, his grandfather smoked for, you know, his whole life and ended up dying from complications of it and he'd say he used to go into the bathroom [LAUGH] and sit in the bathroom and smoke a cigarette --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know what the deal was with that, but um after -- and he has been dead for like fifteen years and we've lived in there for five years, okay.  In -- in the bath- -- and we've painted the bathroom a couple of times --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and one day I'm looking at the bathroom wall and there's this like brown like drops of something, kind of running down the wall and I thought, "What is that?" and I wiped it off.  Well, like couple of months later it's back again -- it's the nicotine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's seeping through the walls and out the paint that's still -- and we washed the walls before we painted em --
R:  It just gets --
L:  -- isn't that disgusting?
R:  -- in there.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can't get the -- I've noticed smells --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Homes where people have smoked and like five years later it can -- you can still kind of smell it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they've painted and --
L:  Well, I was amazed at that because it's like -- it's still seeping out of the walls after -- and he's, you know -- I mean, this has been -- he hasn't been in that house for twenty years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm like, "Wow, just think of what that's doing in your body then".
R:  I know.  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah I'm all for the anti smoking stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know -- and then -- and on the other hand, I mean, you know, I figure if -- if I'm at your house and you smoke, that's your prerogative, but if you're at my house and you smoke, not at my house, you know?
R:  Oh, no.  No.  I would have no- -- even when I smoked, I would have never -- I was kind of a closet smoker, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
