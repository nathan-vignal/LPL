L:  Hi, my name is Jody[?].
R:  Hi, ah, my name is Marion[?].
L:  Hi, Marion.
R:  Hi.  I live near Kansas City, Missouri.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm near Fort Wayne, Indiana.
R:  Oh, nice to talk to you.
L:  Nice to talk to you also.  Um, do you guys have any places that are banning smoking in your area?
R:  I don't think so.  I know they're doing that out on the west coast --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I mean, you know, besides just your normal doctors' offices and stuff like that.
L:  Sure.
R:  I don't think any restaurants or anything are doing that here yet.
L:  Okay.  We have a lot that are doing it here in Fort Wayne.  Um, I mean, honestly that would be my preference.  I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't smoke and, um, we kind of have a -- a family history of people that did smoke and ended up with cancer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're gone and -- and my whole family is, um, y- you know, pretty well on the -- where u- usually they don't want to be around smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  My grandmother was --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- just diagnosed with lung cancer --
L:  Really?
R:  -- but she's -- was never a smoker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but she was around a lot of smokers.
L:  Sure.  Sure.
R:  So, that may have been the culprit --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I actually quit smoking six months ago --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  -- after smoking for twenty two years. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Congratulations.
R:  Thanks.  Um, I agree with not smoking in public places, even as a smoker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I think it- -- I found it offensive, even as a smoker --
L:  Really?
R:  -- going to a restaurant where people were smoking.
L:  Hm.
R:  Um, I can't imagine like bars ever banning it.
L:  You know, I think --
R:  Um --
L:  -- I had heard that there may be a few here that are trying that, but the clientele is different --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  You can go to a -- ah, a -- a higher class restaurant --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you can pu- -- you know, do that.  In fact --
R:  You can have your drinks and ...
L:  -- I think our Pizza Hut is almost to that.  You know?  Where they're talking about, you know, just having nobody smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  I think that's great.
L:  I do too.  I really do.
R:  I really do.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Um, but I have children, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't want to take your kids into the restaurant and expose them to the smoke --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because even as a smoker I did it outside my home, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't expose the kids to it.
L:  Yeah.  And that's --
R:  Um --
L:  -- you know, that's really thoughtful when you do that too, because [LAUGH] I know there are a lot of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people that -- they don't care what an- anybody thinks --
R:  I know, one of --
L:  -- "Hey, I smoke.  This is the way it is" you know?
R:  One of the questions -- it says, "What do you think about the ads?" --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I think the ads are great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I know myself, something that helped me quit smoking was an ad that I saw that helped me link up to, um, a web page that was called quit net dot com --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and it was a huge support group, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it would help you -- it logged for you h- how many cigarettes you have not smoked --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- how many days of your life you have saved by not smoking --
L:  Well, that's a lot of help.
R:  -- um, I used that at first, you know, several times a day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there was people to chat with and they had groups that you could join and --
L:  Sure and that would keep to encourage you to continue that.
R:  -- and I think that -- I -- I really think that's what helped me do it this time, because it wasn't my first time to try.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, ah --
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  -- and if it wasn't for seeing an ad, I wouldn't have known about that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- support out there.
L:  Sure.  Yeah and I think it's really -- I -- I think they need to target more of the younger kids though --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  There are so many kids that -- I -- I work at a school and I tell you what, these kids come in, even sixth, seventh and eighth grade --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they just reek, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'll -- [LAUGH] I'll walk past them and go, "Does somebody in your house smoke? --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- Are you smoking?  You know, you really need to think about what you're doing" [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's so accessible, you know, especially when someone in your household smokes and --
R:  I would think now it would not be as a- -- as accessible as it was, like when I was growing up, because there's --
L:  Probably not as much. [COUGH]
R:  Um, I -- you do wonder where they are getting them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, with -- there's more strict laws on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not selling them to minors.
L:  Well, there are still some parents out there that are purchasing for their kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, in fact I had a -- a junior in high school tell me that his parents were buying the cigarettes.  He wanted to quit and asked for the patch --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they wouldn't buy it for em.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  And I'm thinking, "Wait a minute, they'll buy you the cigarettes and they will not help you stop?".
R:  Isn't that something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even as -- when I was a smoker, I said I would never allow my kids to smoke --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- um, you know, and even if he decided he was going to be a smoker, he wasn't going to smoke in my house. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  Because I wasn't going to condone it, um, because boy it's tough to quit and --
L:  Oh, it sure is.
R:  -- um --
L:  Oh, definitely.  I understand that.  Um, what -- did you remember some of the -- or what the other question was they talked about?
R:  I couldn't understand it [LAUGH] actually --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- [LAUGH] very well.
L:  I caught the first two and then I was like, "What?".
R:  Um, a lot of it was just about, you know, the public places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the ads --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and that's about the only thing I could understand them say.
L:  Yeah.  You know, I think about -- ah, we were in an outdoor pool in the summer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there are so many times when people will be smoking on the beach --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they just put the ashes and put the -- the cigarette butts just right down in the sand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and from that end of it, I look and I think, "Oh, my gosh" [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's just ridiculous.  We end up having to walk around -- we take a Pepsi cup and I put gloves on the kids --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they walk around and pick em all up and it and, you know, [LAUGH] it's a dirty habit --
R:  It is --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- it's terrible.
L:  Yeah.  And especially when you're not responsible for what you're doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's much worse [COUGH] also.
R:  It is -- it's very hard as a smoker, um, when you're in public places that are outdoors though, not to do it.  Like at the sporting events and stuff --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- I -- I found that really, really difficult.  Um --
L:  Well, they don't have anything right there for you --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- and you know?  We talked about that, we don't -- I mean, [LAUGH] it's almost like, you know, the beach is the ashtray --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we thought about that -- we talked about that too and, um, you know, what do you do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or how -- you know, what do you put where?  Because if it's not right in front of somebody that's smoking, the- -- you know, they flick it and it's gone.
R:  Well, I think it's great that they are banning it in the public places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, because it is such a nasty habit --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and I think it en- -- it is kind of embarassing, I mean, when you have to like go outside to smoke --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but that's good, that's great.
L:  But yeah, I was going to say, it kind of puts the pressure on a little bit.
R:  It puts the pressure on you and it makes it that much more of an ugly habit to make --
L:  Right.
R:  -- people want to quit.
L:  Right.  And see legally, we can't say, um, that you're not allowed to smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because there are kids that come in with cigarettes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we can post a sign that says, "Nobody under eighteen permitted to smoke" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they can't buy em --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you know, we really can't enforce it because it's not illegal for them to smoke, it's illegal for them to purchase --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and there's a difference [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's kind of a hard line --
R:  So, what type of advertisement do you think would be good for the kids to -- how would you target the -- the -- the --
L:  Um --
R:  -- adolescents?
L:  You know, a couple of kids we had talked to at school that we know that smoke and -- and, you know, one of our things was, "You come walk with me, we'll go through a cancer ward sometime --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or we'll go through ...".  You know, "You watch what somebody goes through when it's --  and I'm saying smoke induced cancer, because there are some that are that way, um, you know, that they know that's the cause".
R:  I like the pictures that they used to show of what someone -- if you could see on -- what someone looked like on the inside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on the outside --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I thought that that, um, was pretty effective --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- with my son.  That made a real impact on him.
L:  Yes, they don't realise what it actually does look like --
R:  Or maybe bring some lungs --
L:  -- or the teeth or ...
R:  -- into the school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from those cadaver.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I know that sounds kind of disgusting but let them see.
L:  Well, in high school for -- for biology type classes that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- would be -- that would be wonderful.
R:  I think it would.
L:  Mhm.  But again, those kids that smoke and have that habit they -- you know, that age group and it's the same way with swimming and drowning and we talk about this all the time, they say that, you know, eighteen to twenty one year olds make the best soldiers as they are also the ones that ha- -- you know, it's the highest drowning rate [COUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and smoking too, because at that age they feel like they're invincible.
R:  Mhm.
L:  "Nothing will hurt me".  Well, I can guarantee you that thirty five years ago my brother in law thought the same thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know? [LAUGH] And now he knows -- I mean -- well, we all know that that's not true, he's not here to -- to show it and --
R:  What -- did he -- what happened to him?
L:  He ended up with small cell cancer --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it was smoking [inaudible].
R:  At what age?
L:  Ah, he was forty six when he died.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  And, ah, you know, [SIGH] be -- from my standpoint, my kids were there and watched him go through what he went through --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my kids will not pick up cigarettes. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it -- my daughter had to do a, um, pro- -- ah, persuasion speech and it started out to be all on why you shouldn't smoke.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, she couldn't go through it, she couldn't make it through.
R:  I have a teenager too and, you know, I had to -- so glad I was able to quit to try to set a better example, um --
L:  Oh, yes.  Definitely so and I think that in itself is going to be almost more of a campaign --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  So, maybe the target is the adults.
R:  Ah, what do you think about, um, more radio or billboards or magazines?
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  I mean, instead of seeing the -- the -- um, glamorous ads.
L:  What about the -- ah, yeah, that's what I was just going to say, all the -- the, um --
R:  Pretty women.
L:  -- celebrities that tho- -- that they show.
R:  Do they still do --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- the ads as much as they used to?
L:  Not as much, but you go through People magazine or even, um, Teen People and --
R:  It's still there?
L:  Yes, it's still there and it's not -- and I'm trying to remember the last one that I saw that I kind of went, "Oh, what a nice shot" you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it -- it really aggravated me, because I thought, "You know, here's somebody they're trying to emulate and there they are with a cigarette in their hand".
R:  Well, the ads I saw in the maga- -- I can't remember what magazine was that it -- um, about the time, you know, I was deciding to quit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They had some really disgusting looking people [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, um, so -- you know, had been smoking for thirty years --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- [LAUGH] and it told how -- how sick they were and -- ah, their cancer and how they only had three months left to live --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and -- and it was -- it made a -- it's an impacter[?].
L:  Mhm.  Yeah and it's really kind of scary, I think, wh- -- you know, when you -- you real-
