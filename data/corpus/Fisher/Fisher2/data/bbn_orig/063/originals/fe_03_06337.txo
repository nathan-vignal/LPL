L:  Hi, my name's Anne.
R:  Hi, my name's Yvonne.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  How are you doing today?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  That's good.  Uh, what do you think about trying to ban smoking?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I think banning smoking in public places is a good idea.
R:  I do too.  I'm -- I'm not a smoker --
L:  I'm not either.
R:  -- myself and it --
L:  In fact, I just -- I'm a, [NOISE] um, a high school teacher and the students that I have right now are [SIGH] writing papers, opinion papers, and this was the topic of one of their papers --
R:  Oh, well, that was good.
L:  -- that they're debating.
R:  Oh, that's good.  Because it's -- one thing, it's a health problem can occur --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in smoking, um, um, secondhand smoke to other people, um, they can get health problems, and they don't even smoke.
L:  That's true.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] it makes your clothes, y- y- you'd be full of smoke, your hair, it's just -- it's uncomfortable, and it's uncomfortable to breathe.
L:  Yes, I -- I find that, uh, even when I go to a restaurant and I n- normally always request very, very, very non smoking for me, as well as my children.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, even if there's smoking in the restaurant it -- we still seem to come home with some kind of residue from it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even if we're sitting a long ways away.
R:  Right.  I don't know -- probably that I thought at first if they said non smoking area, the smoke from the other area, I thought it was sucked up w- -- uh, from the air conditioner --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I guess, like you say, it still --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- drifts over there too, to --
L:  Well, some of the --
R:  -- the non smoking area.
L:  -- some restaurants or --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- other public places, they have, you know, devices that I think they actually do try to siphon the smoke up, [NOISE] but usually it's just, uh, sort of [NOISE] separated by a wall, or just a general area of -- a place is designated non smoking in.
R:  Right.
L:  The rest -- smoking [SIGH] and it -- it does really, uh, [NOISE] affect the quality of a --
R:  It --
L:  -- a meal or any kind of night out that you have --
R:  It does, it's -- it's --
L:  -- and it drives me crazy.
R:  It does, because you -- you can't breathe, it's --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- like it's smothering you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it -- it -- I don't --
L:  [SIGH] But --
R:  -- I don't like it.
L:  -- [NOISE] we're in, um, [NOISE] in Michigan and there are some restaurants around us, because the county that we're in has just passed a, um, they passed a no smoking [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- u- um, sort of ordinance --
R:  M- mhm.
L:  -- for lots of different public buildings.  Of course, they didn't include restaurants or bars --
R:  Okay, right.
L:  -- which is the place where you'd probably find it the most.
R:  That's right.
L:  But they did pass that, and it has made a difference, and there are a few restaurants that have gone voluntarily to non smoking and I find that usually these are -- are restaurants that --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I wanna go to, it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- nice not to have to worry about that.
R:  They have stopped it a lot, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, well, no smoking in the elevators or, you know, a -- a lot of the public places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for safety reasons and, you know, for, like, for the elderly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they can't -- you know, the ones that don't smoke, that's bad for them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially if people -- if they already have emphysema --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that is not good, and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the ones that are smoking, they need to be careful because of emphysema, or the tar or nicotine in their lungs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I have a friend, oh, she smokes like a train --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and this [LAUGH] -- it -- she wonder why I don't come and see her.  It's not that -- she's handicapped now, she's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in a wheelchair, but it -- I would love to go see her more often, but I cannot stand the smoke, it burns my eyes.  I have glaucoma now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  -- it burns your eyes, it's -- you know, there's people -- it's not good, and she don't understand.  And I know she's depressed, because she's a very active person and she's a cleaning fanatic and she can't get around and do the things that she wanted t- to do, like she used to do --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and then she gets depressed, and then she grabs a cigarette, and then she puts that one out to get another one, or either she'll light one on the other one, you know, she's a chain smoker.
L:  Right.
R:  And I tell her, "You're not supposed --" the doctor have told her --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- said she needs to stop smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she has a breathing machine to help clea- clear her lungs up and clean 'em out, but -- and she's supposed to do that, I think, like, three or four times a day and I don't when the last time she has done that, and I told her, "That's bad.  You --" you know, but she just -- she says she gets nervous, and then she -- instead of her eating, she smokes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I go, "You need to get a piece of candy" or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, something.
L:  It's -- I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I can only imagine how difficult it would be because, you know, I -- there are people in my family who are smoke -- who -- they are addicted to it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I know there are kids at school even who are addicted to it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and some of the- -- I mean, [MN] [SIGH] --
R:  Young people --
L:  -- they've tried to quit.  I don't know -- I don't know how it must feel.  I -- the only thing I can equate it to is, you know, thinking of the food that you crave in times of stress --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and never being able to eat that again.
R:  I -- I kn- -- I know, I could imagine, I think.
L:  But probably a stronger -- even than that.
R:  Mm, mhm, I could imagine.  Just like an alcoholic.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  You know?  If they can't get a drink, you know how they act, well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they need a drink, and then, like, a smoker --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, like, she smokes when she gets her cup of coffee in the morning --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with a cigarette and then, like, if she eats lunch, a [inaudible] she'll get a cigarette --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then -- and she -- at dinner and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- before she go to bed, she smokes a cigarette, and I've told her, "When they put you in bed --"
L:  [COUGH]
R:  "-- quit trying to smoke that cigarette in bed, that's dangerous".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because that's when she take her medication.  She could drop it and then, by her seeing the cigarette, but she's not able to, you know, pick it up, because she's paralyzed from the waist down.
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  And then -- so, she keeps her -- she said, "Well, I have a glass of water over here and I'll just pour it on there".  It might not be that simple, you might -- can't reach it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or it might roll under the bed, you know?  And, oh, she just had me so nervous.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  And I told her, I said, "Well, if you're going --".  I says, "I'll stay on the phone with you until you put that cigarette out". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah --
L:  Well, you know, I have a --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- a -- my sister in law is a smoker and I know it's infuriating to her sometimes for the places that she wants to go to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they won't let her -- sh- -- I mean, she can't smoke in there, she has to go outside or whatever and -- and I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- understand, you know, some people's arguments are the fact that, well, you know, it's just, like, choosing to drink or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but when you are breathing out that smoke --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it does affect other people, as you say, passive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smoke or secondhand smoke --
R:  And -- that's right.
L:  -- and when that [COUGH] -- I think the, um, [LIPSMACK] the statistic that I read today in the students' paper that he had quoted was that two hundred people die every year in the United States alone from -- as a direct result of --
R:  Secondhand smoke.
L:  -- secondhand smoke.
R:  That's bad, that is so bad.
L:  I mean, that's -- that's just --
R:  And they don't even smoke. [LAUGH]
L:  No, and they don't smoke.
R:  A- and -- and tha- that's bad.
L:  I know there are a lot of children in school who, you know, come [MN] -- come to class and their clothes --
R:  They smell like smoke. [LAUGH]
L:  -- smell like smoke and you --
R:  They've got -- yeah.
L:  -- assume -- I -- I started doing this when I first started teaching, of course, that these children were smoking themselves, and so you -- I would ask them, you know, if -- if they needed help or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- w- whatever, just try to broach the subject with them, and a few of them I know do smoke, and the reason that they got into it is because this is the behavior that they see all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  But more of them [LAUGH] than not will say to me, very embarrassed, "Well, I don't actually smoke.  It's my Mom" or, "It's my Dad" or, "It's --" you know --
R:  Right.
L:  "-- someone, "My brother or sister who does and I -- and I've tried to get them quit and I just can't".
R:  I know.
L:  And they're just stuck with it and it's just -- it's horrible.
R:  And I guess the poor children, if they come to school smelling like smoke in their clothes, I guess you got to spray with F- Febreeze --
L:  Yeah, it [LAUGH] --
R:  -- poor children, so they can breathe.
L:  I know.
R:  Poor children.
L:  It's --
R:  It's -- it's a shame.
L:  It is.
R:  I- it really is a shame.  I, uh -- I don't know.  And then the cigarettes are so expensive.  It's like putting gas in your car.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they still buy -- she buys hers by the carton or --
L:  Oh.
R:  "-- three or four packets at a time.  I said, "My goodness, you could buy something else with that.  You could buy you something to wear or --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- buy you something to eat" you know?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  My goodness. [LAUGH] My goodness, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm so glad, when I was a teenager I tried to smoke, and it like to choke me to death.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and then I didn't like to smoke because they said you're supposed to inhale it, swallow it or something --
L:  [COUGH] Right.
R:  -- and blow it out your nose and I could never do that.  But my friends were doing it and I wanted to be, you know, with my friends --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I got choked so bad, I thought I was gonna die.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- when I blow the smoke out, I kind of fanned it, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- 'cause I -- I did -- didn't -- I was, like, "Oh, I can't be a smoker.   I don't like it".  Uh, I --"
L:  Yeah, I've never -- I never tried it.  I was never even --
