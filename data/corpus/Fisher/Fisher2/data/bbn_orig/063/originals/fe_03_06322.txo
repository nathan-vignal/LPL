L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  This is Martha.
R:  Hi, Martha.  This is Leslie[?].
L:  Hello, Leslie.
R:  Hi, this is my first call.
L:  Well, mine too, so we're [LAUGH] -- we're in it together. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, we're to talk about smoking, I guess.  I don't smoke.  Do you smoke?
R:  I do not smoke.
L:  My husband does not smoke, noone smokes here -- our -- at our home.
R:  Well, that's true for us as well.  Although growing up my mother smoked like a fiend.
L:  Well, my father, I remember him smoking but he -- he didn't last very long from smoking.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  My mother also suffered --
L:  Did sh- --
R:  -- um, she -- she -- she had a stroke a couple of years ago --
L:  Oh, right. [inaudible] --
R:  -- and that was due to smoking, directly.
L:  Does -- does she still smoke or has she ...?
R:  Um, she has stopped smoking.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  So, that was -- that's been a good -- that's been a good thing.
L:  Well, yes it has been a good thing.  Um -- I, um, lost my first husband to smoking, he died of lung cancer.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Yeah, so I, um [LAUGH] -- I -- the next husband I married, I made sure he did not smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  I bet.
L:  Yes.  Do you have small children at home?
R:  Yes, we have two children.  I have twins --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- and, um, we were just recently on vacation staying with some friends and, ah, one of them smoked, but he smoked upstairs --
L:  Okay.
R:  --but it was interesting because the smoke would waft downstairs and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my throat would constrict and I -- I gagged a few times.
L:  Yes, I've -- we have friends that do that, they -- they -- they go back in the bathroom and smoke or whatever --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but you can still smell it in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in their, um -- ah, you can still smell it in their homes.  So, ah -- but that's their privilege, as long as they do it in their home and not out where I can smell it, I don't -- you know, I don't mind.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Ah -- and I -- I hate to be eating or -- or in a store where someone is smoking, I -- especially in a grocery store, I don't approve of that --
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  -- but the -- of course they -- I guess they have their rights, they -- I -- they say it's a very hard habit to break.  I am so glad I do not smoke.
R:  I, um -- I -- I am glad for that also, because I -- I just don't know that I would have the willpower to stop.  [inaudible] --
L:  Well, I remember when I was younger -- I'm in my early sixties, I remember, you know, of course it was the thing to -- to have a cigarette in your finger, you know, I [inaudible] -- I -- I tried smoking but I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I thought it was too expensive and I did not enjoy it, so I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, um, I did not, um -- I'm so glad I didn't get the habit. [LAUGH]
R:  When I was young and I thought that that would be the cool thing to do --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I got so sick to my stomach --
L:  Did you really?  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I actually had to go to bed.  It was in the middle of the day and I'm so grateful for that, because two of -- oh, let's see, one, two, three of my four brothers smoke --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, ah -- um, actually I take that back, um, o- one of them had to stop smoking because in his -- I think he was about forty when he developed a heart problem --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and that was kind of a fluke thing, but he needed a pacemaker and the doctor said, "If you want to die, keep -- you know, keep smoking" --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  So, of course he quit right away and ...
L:  Well, I'm so glad.  Do you talk to your children about smoking?
R:  They're only -- um, they're not quite three, so --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- they're a little too young.
L:  Well, I hope --
R:  So, we just --
L:  -- I hope that they, um -- I gue- -- I guess it's so easy to pick up, you have -- your friends smoke or whatever or in -- in school nowadays I guess everyone is -- well, kids now have so much -- they -- they see so much of this stuff on TV and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and in the ads and so forth.  Of course smoking, they don't have cigarettes any more, but all the movie stars in the movies they smoke or whatever, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- so, I -- I don't approve of that either.  I -- of course, ah -- [LAUGH] what are you going to do, you know?  It- -- it's here, it's just like eating or anything else, it -- it's here.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But I think they should raise taxes so high noone could afford em. [LAUGH]
R:  Now, didn't they do -- where did they do that -- they just did that in Maine, didn't they?  Where they raised taxes very, very high and they saw a pretty good decrease in the amount of children smoking --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because the taxes -- ah, I mean, it was just -- it then became cost prohibitive for a lot of kids.
L:  Yes, um -- ah, well we tried --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm in Missouri, so we tried two -- we tried two -- two times to get it I think and -- and, ah, people either turn it down or the -- or they -- they can't get it through the -- you know, through the State Department or what- -- I don't know anyway --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, a lot of people are -- I guess it's their -- their right to smoke or -- so, yeah.
R:  Well, I suppose it is their right to smoke, but it's not my right --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to -- to smell it --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in a restaurant or something and --
L:  What does your husband think of this?
R:  Well, he -- he doesn't like to be around it either and he used to smoke --
L:  Oh, all right.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, before I met him.  In fact, we -- when we were dating, the first time I saw him with a cigarette I just couldn't ke- -- take my eyes off him, I was just so shocked to see him --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with a cigarette and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it didn't -- because it didn't fit him, ah [several inaudible words] the way I thought of him anyway and, um, he was still in the process of quitting smoking and then -- and -- and then he was, I don't know, strong enough or had the ability t- to give it up and -- and so he's never looked back, which is wonderful.
L:  Well, really, when you think of the cost, what are they, two or three dollars a pack?
R:  I -- I -- I think at least that much, yeah.
L:  That's -- what?  Ah, twenty or thirty dollars a week.  Can you imagine what you can do with twenty [LAUGH] or thirty dollars a week?
R:  Oh, I could do quite a bit. [LAUGH]
L:  Put it -- put it -- either save it or you know, or -- or buy a nice pair of jeans or shoes or, you know --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you could do a lot of stuff, ah -- so, ah, I'm -- I'm like you, I -- I disapprove of it but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- noone smokes in my home and I try to not to let my company smoke or very few people we know do smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but my -- my nephew who has just turned forty or so, he just started smoking, I could not believe it.
R:  Oh, that's surprising --
L:  Yes, all these ye- --
R:  -- at that -- I mean, that's kind of old.
L:  Um, his daddy smoked and his -- his sister smokes, but he never took the habit and then all at once he decided he was going to smoke.
R:  Huh.
L:  I don't know what he's trying to prove. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  You'd think that old, he would know better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Because he's been around quite a bit.  He's been all over the country working and things and I'm sure he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he knows most people do not approve of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But um, that's his -- [LAUGH] his privilege, but ah [LAUGH] --
R:  Interesting.
L:  -- and he -- and he  lives with my -- he lives with my sister, he's -- he's divorced, so he moved back home to momma --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, she doesn't smoke, so he has to go outside to smoke and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because she will not let him smoke in the house.  She -- she has, um, allergies and things so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she can't -- cannot smoke, so.  I just can't -- can't believe a person that old would take up smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  It's very surprising.
L:  Yes, especially he's sort of a tight wad to start with.
R:  Huh.
L:  -- you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that is interesting.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  I won- -- I wonder what motivated him --
L:  You know --
R:  -- and of course, you know, we probably -- you probably could never know that, maybe he doesn't even know it, but you know, it's interesting that at forty years old, especially if he's kind of tight with his money --
L:  I know I --
R:  -- he would choose that.
L:  I know I would never spend that much. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I wouldn't either --
L:  Are you?  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm a tight wad too --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in that respect I would never --
L:  Do you work outside the home or are you a home maker?
R:  I'm ho- -- I'm at home with my twins.
L:  Oh, well that's good, I'm glad you got to stay home [inaudible].
R:  Thank you.  Me too.
L:  And I'm sure you enjoy, ah -- ah, what do you have, a boy and a girl?
R:  Yes, one of each.
L:  One of each, well that's wonderful, ah --
R:  I'm a desperate for them not to smoke.
L:  Oh, yes.  Um --
R:  I just really ...
L:  Well, I'm sure -- ah, being raised in a home without smoking and -- ah, I'm sure you would teach them, [SIGH] that it's not a good habit to have --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- and how bad it will be and plus their health --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- plus your health --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and their -- and their families' health, that it -- it will be, um -- it would be better.  Um, I just signed up for this yesterday, when did you sign up?
R:  Al- also yesterday.
L:  Well, all right.  I thought it would be a week or so before I got a call, so I was -- I was quite pleased to -- to get one already --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- um, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  And this has been fun talking with you.
L:  Yes, I've -- I've enjoyed it, um, of course I -- I don't talk to many people.  My husband a- and I are both retired, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're -- we're homebodies and -- and, um, we were going to travel and see the world, but we didn't do that, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, once we retired, we just retired, so.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, ah, I don't know much else to say about smoking and we --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- both disapprove of it and --
R:  You know, let me tell you, we just, um, recently moved from Colorado and, ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- several years ago Boulder, Colorado, a big college town --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, initiated the no smoking ban in public places --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and, um, we were pretty surprised that it passed.  It passed and, um, you know, the -- the city's really been thriving and I think you can sm- -- where can you smoke?  I think maybe you can smoke in a bar --
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  -- and you can smoke, I thought I remember something that struck me kind of silly, like in a cigar shop or something like that --
L:  Well --
R:  -- but -- but you cannot smoke -- it's illegal to smoke out on the sidewalk.
L:  Okay, good.  I -- that -- that's good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I hate seeing people standing around.  They- they're outside freezing to death and they're smoking.
R:  You're right.
L:  Ah, what about jails, what do you think of people that are incarcerated, should they -- they be allowed to smoke?
R:  Hm.  Well, I don't -- I don't think I have a problem with that, um --
L:  Them -- them smoking?
R:  I -- I guess I don't really have a problem with them smoking.  Um --
L:  Lot -- a lot of jails --
R:  -- what do you think?
L:  A lot of jails do banned it.  Well, I -- I think they're -- they have a lot of their privilege taking away from them already, so I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they -- they should be allowed -- ah, at least allowed to do that I think, but -- but most jails do banned it now, I -- I've heard.
R:  I didn't know that.  Huh.
L:  Yes, I think my -- my brother -- my -- my nephew was in for speeding or getting a ticket or something for awhile and -- and he was not allowed to smoke, so.
R:  What do you know.  Well, of course you know that you and I are paying for their lung cancer and their -- all their heal- -- the health problems associated with their smoking --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but I still -- that's a tough one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess I -- I -- I guess I feel that, um, they should be -- th- they should be allowed.  Maybe in a [MN] -- um, maybe they should be segregated if they -- if they want to go smoke, you know, "Here's a big smoking room" or something like that.
L:  Well, I -- I agree with you.  Just certain times that they -- they could have -- have a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have a smoke or -- because they don't get many privilege -- um, of course they're in there for doing -- f- for being in trouble to start with, so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess there's another
