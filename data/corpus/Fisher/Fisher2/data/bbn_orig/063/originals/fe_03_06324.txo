R:  Hello.
L:  Hey.
R:  Hi, my name is Jean[?], I'm from New Orleans.
L:  My name is Robyn[?], I'm from Alabama.
R:  How you doing in Alabama?
L:  [LAUGH] How are you doing there? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, just fine.  Thank you.
L:  Good to talk to you.
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  Well, we got to talk about this smoking subject.
R:  Well, do you smoke?
L:  No, I don't.  Do you?
R:  I don't smoke either.
L:  Well, I guess we both --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for this thing.
R:  Well, I guess we are.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How do you feel about smoking when you're out in a public place eating?
L:  Oh, I don't like it.  If -- if it's -- you know, if it's near me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or if -- if --
R:  Right.  You ask for the non smoking section?
L:  Ye- -- I always ask for the non smoking section.
R:  Okay.  How about hotel rooms --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- do you ask for non smoking rooms?
L:  Yes.
R:  Me too.
L:  Yes, I want the non smoking room in the hotel.
R:  Can I give you a really quick example of one thing that happened to me?  I went to Memphis on vacation, all right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- I had a rental car all ready for me, top of the line, deluxe rental car --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I was so looking excited --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to get in this car [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well, I went and I paid for it and I got in my car and the first thing I did was take a sniff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was a smoking car --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the person that had it before me had smoked and I never thought, "Well, are there non smoking cars and smoking cars?" --
L:  Well, I wouldn't have thought about that either.
R:  -- but guess what, there are.  And -- and I said -- I -- I drove around the block and I told my son, I said, "We paid almost a hundred dollars a day for this car --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- I'm going to get my monies worth".
L:  That's right.
R:  So, I brought it back, I said, "If I have to wait another two hours to get a clean one --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- I will" and I was appalled.
L:  Well, it looks to me like that they would have someone going over them cars.
R:  They do.  They, um -- they have -- um, they can spray it out, but I guess if you don't ask for it --
L:  You're right.
R:  -- how would you know and I'm trying to think of other situations other than the rental cars and going out to eat and the hotel rooms --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well -- well, um -- okay, let's say if we did smoke, how would we feel about having to be displaced [NOISE] and go outside?
L:  Well, that's true.  I -- I know the smokers really feel put out by all this.
R:  Yeah, they do, because I know -- I think it is New York you can't smoke in any public place --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or any pl- -- [several inaudible words] any public place --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- any place inside period, right?
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  So, how would this affect the people in California, say, who have the smog problem?
L:  Right.
R:  If they- -- if they're bringing all the smoke outside, wouldn't that just contribute to the smog problem --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- and make things even worse?
L:  I'm sure it would.  Yes.
R:  So, you know, there's all kind of different angles we can take from this, okay.
L:  Yes and -- and then you take this cancer thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it comes up with -- with cancer, so often it's caused by smoking, so that's a big no no.  So, it- it's just hard.  It's hard on the smokers and it's hard on us.
R:  Is this your first time calling?
L:  No, I've had one other call.
R:  Okay.  Do you know -- what are we allowed three per day or three for the whole thing or do you know how this works?
L:  Ah, I -- I read somewhere where you had -- you could do five calls --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on each phone.  Like if you had a cellphone you could use it --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- or -- and your other phone too.  But five calls per phone.  That's what I --
R:  Per day or just for -- just for the survey?
L:  I think for -- no, no, no --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] no.  I think it's one call per day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but you can -- you --
R:  Well, I called twice yesterday, so.
L:  You did?  Well, I guess you can do more than one.
R:  Well, you know, it says limit three calls -- at least on my email it said --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I have a lot to say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It said, "You may participate in up to three calls" it didn't say per day, per phone, um ...
L:  Well, I -- I read somewhere -- I read a lot on this, somewhere it was twenty five calls in all that could be done.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, twenty five in all?
L:  So, it did say, "Five per phone", I'm sure of that.  Five per phone.  And then --
R:  And it's ten dollars each time we call?
L:  That's what it says.
R:  So, whatcha ya doing, one phone call a day --
L:  That's what I'm trying to do, yeah.
R:  -- for twenty five days?
L:  Well, I -- I hadn't gotten that far yet.  I hadn't thought that far ahead.
R:  Get's you two hundred and fifty dollars?
L:  It -- [several inaudible words] would be nice, wouldn't it?
R:  Just think of all the -- you know and another thing with people that really, really irks me and I live near New Orleans and I see all these poor people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I have nothing against them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but you know what they do?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They sit on their steps[?] to their house, their babies barely have clothes on them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they barely have food in their mouth --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there, people are puffing away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on those cigarettes and do you know cigarettes cost a lot?
L:  They sure do.  But you know, ah -- the -- the -- ah, poor people are the -- most likely to be the smokers.
R:  Yeah and they get their little [inaudible] cheques and stuff from the government that pays for their kids --
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  -- and what they're doing is they're going in and they're taking that [inaudible] cheque and say they're going to buy a gallon of milk or whatever and say it's a ten dollar thing or -- ah, it might be a debit card now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know how it works, and then they use the rest of that money on cigarettes.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, it's not -- they have all the [several inaudible words] beg, borrow and steal to buy cigarettes with.
R:  And -- and -- and when it comes to a point and I'm going to [inaudible] -- be very adamant about this and if you don't like it, just hold your ears. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  When it gets to a point where cigarettes replace my children's health --
L:  Right.
R:  -- welfare or education, it's the parents that need to be reprimanded for this --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not the government --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not the people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, you know, going out is one thing, but if you can't control it -- and it's a bad habit.
L:  It is a bad habit.
R:  My momma who was -- who's a non smoker, she used to work at a bingo hall --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she used to come home smelling like smoke --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it gets in your clothes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it gets in your bra --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it gets in your [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  Your hair?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Your hair?
R:  Your -- thank you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Your hair.  Would you like to snuggle up with someone who smells like smoke?
L:  No, I would not. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I think if I did, I wouldn't know if there was a fire, because I'd be thinking that they're the one that smells like [inaudible] -- smoke, how could I tell the difference?
L:  That's right.  How would you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if there's a fire or not? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you sound like such a pleasant person.
L:  Well, you do too.  You -- you -- and you're real chatty.  That -- it's good if I get hold of a chatty person because I don't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- talk a whole lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you don't?
L:  No, I'm not a big talker --
R:  Well, you --
L:  -- that's really not [inaudible] --
R:  -- you sound fun.
L:  I didn't know, ah, whether I would -- you know, work with this well or not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the -- the two calls I've had have been -- you know, I've had good talkers.
R:  Good.  Good for you.
L:  Yeah.  Well, back to the subject. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm trying to think of what other things we're supposed to ask.  About cancer?
L:  Oh, yeah.  We're supposed to talk about cancer and -- and, you know, that was one of the -- the topics.
R:  How about if anybody else in your family smokes?  Nobody in my -- my husband does not smoke.
L:  My husband smoked for years and years but he --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- quit about ten years ago and --
R:  Oh, for health reasons?
L:  -- no -- no he -- well, yes I guess you could call it that.  He got to where he couldn't breathe good --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- you know?  He got -- where he was short winded?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- and so he quit smoking and that got better, so.
R:  Wow.  Isn't that amazing.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, you -- how about the environment, how would we clean it up?
L:  Ah, I don't know what to do to clean up the environment.
R:  And you know what's really stupid, it takes two cents to make a cigarette and five bucks for a carton -- ah, no -- no for a pack, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Doesn't -- doesn't that just annoy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it does.  And -- and the people that will buy em --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's just like burning money.
R:  Yeah, you're right.
L:  Yeah, because you might as well go out there and set fire to your money.
R:  Oh, you are so right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  What else are we supposed to talk about?  Trying to remember.  We're against it, we don't like it, it's bad for your health, it's cancers. [NOISE] What was the other questions?
L:  I can't remember no more.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] about covered it. [LAUGH]
R:  I think we did.
L:  I think so too.  How many children do you have?
R:  I have three children --
L:  Three children.
R:  -- um, almost seventeen, almost eleven and just -- one that just turned four, all boys. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I -- I hope --
L:  Well, you still got -- you still got a young family.
R:  Well, you know, my -- my middle one, I mean, my oldest one went through this thing where he thought he was going to smoke --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- so I took him to my boat house and I took him out there and I said, "Honey, look you want to smoke that's fine with me".  I went and bought him a carton of cigarettes, I said, "You and me are going to sit here and after some Coke, you're going to smoke the whole carton".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "If you gotta smoke, you're going to smoke it now, you're going to get it over with".  It's kind of like gambling --
L:  Right.
R:  -- once you go, you think it's the glittery lights, the free food --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's wonderful, but when you lose that twenty dollars in five minutes --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it hurts --
L:  It hurts and it's not so good. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, we got out there and I -- he -- I don't think he thought I was serious.  I bought a cart- -- I paid twenty five dollars for a carton of cigarettes --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- I said, "Dude, you're going to sit here and smoke every one".  He says, "Momma, I don't think I want to smoke, so".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it's like, beer too.  Ah, if he ever asks, I'll say, "Look, I'll buy the first case, you're going to sit here and drink the whole case --"
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  -- and get sick" and --"
L:  Get real sick.
R:  -- how about you?
L:  Get real sick.
R:  Do you have any children, grandchildren?
L:  Oh, yes.  Yes, I have four children --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and ten grand children.  I'm seventy years old.
R:  Oh, get out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm forty one.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm what you call one of them senior citizens. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you're the good oldies.
L:  Yeah, but I haven't ever smoked.  But my husband smoked and my father smoked, so.
R:  Oh, now I did it in high school just to be with the other kids --
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  -- I did it in my senior year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just to fit in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I wasn't really a smoker, I just, you know, put it out --
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- if they did smoke, I did.  But um --
L:  You did -- did what your crowd did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know and that doesn't make it right either.
L:  No, it don't.
R:  But if my kids ask me, I'm going to tell them the truth --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- and the truth is, is that cigarettes are bad for you --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and I know it's going to keep North Carolina out of business, because they have the big tobacco growing --
L:  Yeah.  That -- that --
R:  -- things.
L:  -- that's the bad part about it.  It's -- it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- put a lot of people out of work and jobs.  I mean, the farmer that grows the tobacco.
R:  But they're charging the -- and then -- and then they're charging us too much.  If it takes them two cents for whatever and they're charging five dollars, who's making the money?
L:  Well, somewhere in the middle.  See, we're farmers too --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, ah, I know that the farmer don't make anything hardly on the product.  It -- it goes through so many people before that cigarette gets made --
R:  It's -- but cigarettes [several inaudible words] -- but tobacco's cheap now.  I've seen big tobacco plants.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the tobacco itself is cheap but --
R:  But the --
L:  -- by the time -- the time it gets into a cigarette, it gets expensive.
R:  So, it must be labor intensive to make the product.
L:  I would think so or they -- somebody's making a big profit somewhere.
R:  Mm.
L:  Mm.  But that's the same  way with all -- ah, like we raise cattle and, ah, you know, we sell the cattle and we don't get that much for them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but then when  you go to the store to buy the beef, it'd knock you out.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, it --
R:  Ooh.  Ooh.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  So, let's see, what else about, um -- about smoking.  Okay.  Never smoked, never did, don't want out kids to do it.  Um, [NOISE] it -- it -- I thought they -- remember how they used to have the ads on the TV and the ads --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the paper.
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm glad they've pulled that out.
L:  That's right, that was a good thing and it -- it looked so glamorous, you know, and the magazines --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would have the pictures of these great Marlboro guys, you know?  And --
R:  Yeah, and -- and now it's going to be back on TV with the liquor.  You see the amount of
