L:  H- hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Raoul[?].
R:  Hi, Raoul.  My name is Nunda[?].
L:  Nunda?
R:  Yes.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  Pretty good. [LAUGH] But --
R:  So, tell me, have you been a smoker?
L:  I am smoker.
R:  You are a smoker.
L:  I'm currently smoking this second. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] I'm an ex smoker and it's been my most favorite thing we're talking about, you know?
L:  No kidding.
R:  So -- so, yeah I've been -- finally I'm an ex smoker now for a year and a half.
L:  A year and half?
R:  Like, I've been a smoker for a long time.
L:  How -- how did you quit?
R:  You know, um, finally I quit through having made a decision not to do it again.  Um, so -- I had tried [several inaudible words] through the years I've quit, like, on and off but having always gone back to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've tried like the patch and I've tried like the gum and I've tried like everything else.  But then finally I was like, "Okay, that's it.  I'm not doing it again".  But -- but it was a tough one and I have -- ah, I completely understand a smoker and why they smoke, you know?
L:  Do you --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- still have the desire at times?
R:  Um, I used to but now it's been like a year and a half and I've just tuned it out of my mind, so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Um, but yeah when -- one -- one odd time when I'm stressed or I'm on work or something and like [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But -- but no -- but it's like as time goes by it becomes more -- something to the past.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah -- so, how do you feel about, um, you know, smoking in public areas?
L:  I think Mayor Bloomberg[?] should be shot in the head. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- where are you from?
R:  I'm from India.
L:  India?
R:  Yes.
L:  Is that where you are now?
R:  No, no, no.  I'm here in Los Angeles. [MN]
L:  Oh, that's what I meant.  Los Angeles, oh California.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And what about you?
L:  Ah, yeah, I'm from New York.
R:  New York, okay.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Okay, so we're both in two cities, that had made it very difficult for smokers.
L:  It -- like virtually impossible --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, just -- about a couple of weeks ago, maybe a month --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, they stopped smoking in bars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my one quest in life was to find a restaurant who had a -- a liquor licence, because if they had a liquor licence I can smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  As long as there was a bar attached to the restaurant you can smoke, so -- now that that's, you know -- can't do that, I mean, I have seen the -- I haven't been the movies since The Godfather.
R:  Uh-huh.  Because you have to go outside --
L:  I don't -- um, you know what --
R:  -- outside to smoke?
L:  -- I'm not comfortable.
R:  [MN] Uh-huh.
L:  Y- you know, to spend ten dollars on the movie to sit there and not smoke, I -- you know --
R:  Oh, in the movie?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.  [several inaudible words] --
L:  So yeah, I'm highly addicted.
R:  Yeah.  So, um -- yes, I have a -- I have a -- you know, having been a smoker I'm completely understanding it but I also have like a different point of view.  I feel that, um, okay fine, they should allow -- um, you know, I wouldn't be for smoking in theatres --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I think it's very distracting and especially it's like, you know, for the non smoker -- because once I became a non smoker I know that, um, it would bother me if somebody sat and smoked consistently [several inaudible words] like if I lived with a smoker --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yes, I'd be completely fine if they went out and smoked or --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- or stuff like that.  So -- so, in the theatre I guess it would bother me just because the smoke would bother me and if you like bring in, like, thoughts that I didn't want --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, and I know that having lived with other non smokers that -- how that smoke would bother me.  But I think -- I think that perhaps there's a happy medium, because you know, at the end of the day it's free choice for everybody and if somebody chooses to smoke then that's their choice --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and if somebody does not choose to smoke that's their choice and I feel like perhaps what they should do is allow -- you know, they -- they still have that thing -- like when I -- when I travel abroad in Los Angeles or anywhere in the US you just can't smoke.  You can't smoke anywhere in the airport, you'd have to like walk out a -- a -- half an hour out of the terminal and then smoke.
L:  That's crazy.
R:  But in -- in Asian countries, what they do is they have what they call smoking sections and they have smoking rooms [several inaudible words] air conditioning.  You can go sit down and you can read magazines and you can smoke --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- so they give people who choose to smoke --
L:  The option.
R:  -- a place to smoke.
L:  See, I completely agree with that.  I'm a considerate smoker.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't want to, you know, offend anybody or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- bother anybody by smoking but um --
R:  Yeah, but you don't want to be, um --
L:  But I don't want to be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that inconvenienced myself.
R:  I -- I completely understand, you know?
L:  You know and the government, um, doesn't have enough guts t- to -- to ban smoking --
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  -- completely --
R:  And you know -- and I think --
L:  -- or the sale of cigarettes because it's too much money.
R:  Yeah and I also think that -- yeah and also when somebody bans something, it's like -- it's trying to con- force somebody to make a choice which I do not think is the happy medium or the way -- the spiritual solution to anything in the world.
L:  They will not --
R:  You know?  Whether it's terrorism or war or smoking or whatever.  I think people should be given a free choice and once something is not -- not banned and, you know -- and it's a free choice but you ha- -- if you want to do it, you know, you have a certain area to do what you want to do, you know?
L:  The government is saying, "We'll sell you the cigarettes because we definitely want the money, but you can't smoke them".
R:  Yeah.  You know?  And that [several inaudible words] --
L:  You know, basically is what -- what's going on.
R:  Yeah and at the end of the day it boils down to an economic profit --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- which seems to be the reason for a lot of decisions that are made.  and, um -- you know -- and I think -- and I think that's fine, you know -- ah, if somebody is a minor in public schools [several inaudible words] yes, do not allow smoking because you know, whatever it's like say at a certain age a person has a choice, but have sections -- but allow people who want to smoke to continue to do what they want to do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- till they make a choice not to, you know?  And the people who choose not to smoke, don't -- you know, can still enjoy the same benefits and don't have to be, um, you know, in areas -- or that -- that -- that smoking is allowed.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- so, that's --
L:  You know and I'm all for all the help that's available.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, for people who choose to quit.
R:  Yeah, e- exactly.  Exactly.
L:  I mean, I'm -- I don't -- I -- it's not that I would, um -- you know, I don't condone smoking, but um -- you know, I would never tell somebody or encourage somebody to smoke, that's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do -- you know, we're not crazy about -- like it's --
R:  True.
L:  -- it's just, you know?
R:  And nor do you want to be preached to, you know?  It's like when I was smoking, the -- the thing that really got my goat was somebody who said, "Oh, you shouldn't be doing that".  I'd be like, "Hello" you know, "I don't need you to tell me --
L:  Right.
R:  "-- it's a choice I'm going to make" so.
L:  Right.  Do -- you know, my answer is to this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "You're kidding.  How come?".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- you know?  And like just watch their face drop --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, "Get out of here, it doesn't cause lung cancer.  Don't be ridiculous, I never heard that" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  It just -- like, make a mockery of them, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  But -- but I think that smoking programs, having used them, I think any kind of positive help that somebody can provide to anybody who chooses not to smoke is -- yes, you know, it's like you get educated about it and you can make a choice.  I know that when I was -- the many times that I quit, there was a reason, especially the first few times that I tried.  And I tried many times and I finally said, "Well, I'm not going to do it again" but I know that the patch really got me through till I could reach a point where I'm like, "Okay, I've weaned myself off this".  So -- so, I think if they allow, um -- ah, you know, if they have -- if they provide services like that or a smoking hotline or whatever works for anybody who wants to use it, that's good.
L:  I --
R:  But people do it by choice --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Definitely by choice and I -- I think with -- with me it's definitely more psychological --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mo- -- ah, most of the sm- -- I'm currently unemployed now --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's been quite some time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I know I'm smoking a tremendous amount, mo- more than I've ever smoked in my life.
R:  Yeah, because you're stressed.
L:  It's stress --
R:  You know?
L:  -- it's I can because I'm at home --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah -- um, it's --
R:  And, you know -- and I completely understand, I kn- know that when I was stressed --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the first thing I used to do was to reach for a cigarette so, you know, [several inaudible words].
L:  And the thing is I -- I also -- I know that it's a physical addiction, I'm not saying that but I know most of them -- these -- that, um, smoking is psychological, I know it.
R:  Yeah.  Now -- no -- would you -- do you -- if you're trying to give up, to quit, would you go for one of the help lines available to help you through?
L:  I go a- -- to all of them. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, so you would use them?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I'm -- I'm -- definitely would -- would go -- um, probably get into, a -- um, an emotional program too.
R:  Like -- like a [inaudible] -- like, ah, something for smokers that --
L:  Twelve steps or whatever.
R:  -- like the -- like for, ah, the AA.
L:  Yes.  Anything.
R:  Something that's a support group and ...
L:  Any kind of a support group, because I would need it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um --
R:  Let me ask you this, do you think you -- you smoke and other smokers continue to smoke beyond when they -- they personally want to give up, just because of the pressure that's on them not to smoke?
L:  No.
R:  You know what I mean?  It's like a rebel.
L:  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I don't think so.
R:  Okay.
L:  I really don't.  I don't think it's a rebellious thing with -- with me, I wish I don't -- I didn't smoke --
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  -- but I don't want to go through the agony of quitting.
R:  Okay.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  And when you finally decide to do it, then -- you know, when things get better and you're back on your spirits and you're jobs going -- and whenever you decide to do it, if you decide to do it, then you would use the different sources available. [MN]
L:  I would, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I also know that quitting smoking to me is going to be a complete- -- a full time job.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's going to take every ounce of energy.
R:  Yeah, no and it's a day at a time.
L:  And str- -- yeah, exactly.
R:  It's totally a day at a time.
L:  Are in twelve steps?
R:  Um -- no, I'm not.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, I'm not, but I know that I, um -- um, you know, one of the things that I -- well, quit smoking -- finally when I said that it's the last time and I -- it's been over a year and a half now and I don't think I'll ever go back --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but -- well, the biggest thing every time I quit was
