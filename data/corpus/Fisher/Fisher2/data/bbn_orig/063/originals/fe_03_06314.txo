R:  Hi, I'm Wendy.
L:  Hi, Wendy.  I'm -- my name's Julie.
R:  Hi.  Um, so the topic of the day is, um, banning smoking and whether that's a good idea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How do you feel about it?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  I'm kind of torn.  I think, um, in some ways, you know, for the people that work there if they don't smoke, you know, it's kind of only fair that they don't have to smell that.  But I think banning it totally is not fair either.  Um, I read in the paper that they were thinking about having, you know, areas that don't have waiters and stuff, so people would have to go get their own drinks and things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they would have to have a ventilation system and maybe that would be a little more fair.  But in restaurants I -- I -- I don't mind it being banned because, you know, you don't really want to smell that while you're eating.
R:  Right.  Right.  Do you think that the, um, quit smoking programs -- ah, if -- if more money was put into that, whether that would help the situation?
L:  I do- -- I don't think so.
R:  You don't think so?
L:  At least not for people that --
R:  How about -- how about for, like, teenagers?
L:  I don't know.  Maybe.  I mean, I -- I don't think it'll change the people that are smoking already.  Um, maybe for the future generations possibly.  I don't know.  They don't -- I don't know if they -- I -- I can't figure out what exactly gets teenagers to start smoking and to not -- or to not smoke.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't know if they would really -- if that really would work or not.
R:  I know that, um, in our family -- there -- there's noone in our family that smokes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have four kids.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my -- my -- my four kids, but especially my two teenagers are very, very opposed to it -- ah, to smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they can't stand being around smokers and they don't know a lot of people that smoke.  It would be very unlikely for them to pick it up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, so -- so I don't know whether -- you know, our little sample is any indication but um, you know, the- they have seen a lot, ah, in health, um, classes -- what happens to lungs and what happens --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, pr- -- in pretty gory detail.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, same with -- same with drugs but um
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, they -- they wouldn't be --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- likely I don't think.
L:  Well, I -- I've -- [several inaudible words] I'm in the health field and what I see, you know, when I go into hospitals --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would say at least fifty percent of the nurses and doctors smoke.
R:  I know, that's tru- -- I'm always shocked.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm sh- -- I mean, wh- why do you think that is [LAUGH], that people --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- smoke?
L:  I -- I really -- [MN] I'm not sure exactly why.  I mean, and, ah -- and a lot of people I know that are -- I mean, I'm in the sports medicine field and a lot of athletes smoke too.
R:  Wow.
L:  So -- and I don't -- I don't know, I'm not really quite sure exactly.
R:  I wonder how they could keep up their performance, ah, with the smoking?
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  And they -- and they're usually the -- the better athletes.  So, you kind of wonder how they would be if they didn't, but they're still -- they still usually pretty much outplay the other people.
R:  Wow, that's --
L:  Like that's probably just a general, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fluke where I'm at, but ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, that -- that's -- I -- I guess that's a one thing, but you know, a- as far as, um, banning it in public places, that -- you know, my concern would be if you take away that freedom you would have vigilantes that would just be so, um, assertive, but that we could produce a worse situation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We could produce a violent situation, so that would be my concern.  Although, I would -- I would hope -- and this is not always -- this is usually not the case --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that people just out of an awareness of being in public places, would choose not to smoke --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but -- but that's not true. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think -- I mean, New York is a little bit different than California, because they're a little more laid back than we are here [LAUGH] ah, for the most part.
R:  Yeah, do you live in the city?
L:  Um, no I live in central New York --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, but even just -- I mean, and California's had -- banned smoking like that for a long time and it's not even a big deal anymore.  You know, they don't even think twice about it, you know?  And it's been that way for a couple of years, so.
R:  Well, not everyone follows the rules and -- and there are -- there was an article in the LA Times just this past week that patios in upscale restaurants have, um, increased and really, you know, ah a lot of money is put into very beautiful patios for smokers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah this -- I know this sounds really juvenile, but -- um, that these patios are being marketed in the restaurants as kind of the coolest places to be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where the cool people hang out.  And it's an industry thing, you have people, kind of, in sunglasses and smoking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's a real LA kind of thing.
L:  Well, that's going to be -- I mean, I was reading the paper the other day, on the front page of the Epica newspaper where I live --
R:  Oh, I used to live in Epica.
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  I did. [LAUGH] My -- my husband went to Cornell.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I live in Epica.
R:  Oh, my husband used to play in a -- in a band there. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, cool. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's funny.  How random.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, the -- the Epica paper had that they were trying to pass it where they could smoke if there wasn't any employees, which must be -- you know, the small dive bars with just the owner, you know, bartends and stuff.  I mean, their business --
R:  Well --
L:  -- will increase hugely.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, they were talking about that and -- and then also like I said, having, you know, the areas that didn't have any employees walking in there.  So, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, w- well, a couple of years ago they had those ads where the waitresses -- ah, this was like an anti dr- -- um, smoking campaign and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the waitresses th- -- there's a huge, um, percentage of waitresses that have lung cancer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, just from being in restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, inhaling the smoke.
L:  Yeah, I don't think -- I mean, i- -- I don't think -- I don't have a problem with restaurants banning that at all, I really don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it bothers me and -- and I have some friends that smoke and stuff and, I mean, it doesn't completely bother me but I don't like it when I'm eating in a restaurant.
R:  No.
L:  You know, in a bar I -- I mean, I don't know, I haven't quite made up my mind on that one yet.  I mean, I think for some places like, you know, out West a little more where it's not as cold and stuff, people can go outside it's not a big deal.  You know, here [several inaudible words] winters out here.
R:  Yeah, it's freezing.
L:  So -- I mean, we get [several inaudible words] ten below, twenty below [several inaudible words] this past year, so --
R:  Yeah.  That's why I'm not there anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I grew up in Buffalo, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, so you're used to it?
L:  I'm used to it.  Yeah.
R:  Buffalo gets -- oh, it's a lot worse.  Well, I mean, I don't -- I don't even like walking down the street and, you know, following someone who's smoking or a car -- I mean, I'm -- we're really sensitive and, you know, I for the most -- well, it's kind of split because -- I was going to say for the most part people are very conscious about, um, e- -- to meet a smoker is very unusual in -- in any group in LA.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's very unusual.  But on the other hand you have the movie industry that if they're showing in the movies that smoking is a cool thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then you've a much higher incidence of smoking, because that's a cool thing.
L:  Right.
R:  And you see it a lot, like I said, in -- in the upscale restaurants.  It's -- it's like, um, you know, cigars were really big a couple of years ago and, um -- but i- -- I don't know, I just -- I just think out of the goodness of people's hearts they should be sensitive to -- um, that they're, you know, around other people that don't want to inhale it or don't want it on their clothes.
L:  Right.  I think part of my issue is more that, um, you know, the government stepping in and trying more and more to control everything.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that's part of -- more of my issue and probably because I live in Epica and that's how they argue. [LAUGH]  But ah --
R:  Yeah, n- -- no, I agree with you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it really comes down to, kind of, freedom versus free will.  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I would not want to take away people's freedoms --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I would really hope that out of their own free will they thought, "This might not be a good thing to do in -- in public places".
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah and Epica has horrible -- I mean, I just remember because my husband played in, um, a lot of bars and clubs and stuff and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the smoking was terrible.  I mean, the -- our clothes smelled so bad [LAUGH] from --
L:  Well, when we get into the smaller -- like the places like Epica where the bars and -- you know, that have that kind of thing are pretty small and old and not ventilated and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that kind of stuff, it very easily becomes very smokey, so.
R:  Yeah and then if -- if you -- if you don't ban it, would the smoking comp- -- the -- the -- um, companies that make the cigarettes, would they put money into something like ventilation systems and all of that?  Would they do that?
L:  Mm.
R:  Because that's where the money should come from, then.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I can see it, you know, on both ways.  So, I'm not really quite sure how I feel about it.  Like I said, the restaurants I think that's fine.  You know, I don't have a problem with that, I just -- I don't know with bars and stuff like that.  I mean, some of the people -- some of my friends are saying, "Well, you know, those people choose to work there" and I don't know how I feel about that either, but ...
R:  Well, it's a hard thing because it's -- is -- they might choose to work there and it might be what works out best in their lives --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they aren't choosing to inhale cigarette smoke.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  If -- they're -- it's -- it's an interesting topic because there are so many, um, freedoms or people feel passionately about, you know, government intruding in- into our lives and yet at the same time, I'm a mom and I don't want my kids around smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And I don't want the cigarettes to ta- -- the cigarette companies to target my kids, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or kids in -- in general.  But I don't see -- um, you know, unless there was a cigarette that was like a smokeless cigarette, you know, maybe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] money could be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, if people could get their hit of nicotine without, um, infecting the environment.
L:  Right.  Well
