L:  So, I don't -- I don't favor it at all.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I do think that, um, those help lines and all of the other anti smoking -- ah, all the other anti smoking things are a good idea --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- especially for those people, you know, who've been smoking for a long time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Of course it causes throat cancer and all kinds of other stuff --
R:  I know, I -- I knew a lot of people have lung cancer, also a lot of people they smoke -- they -- they throw [inaudible] the cigarette butts all over the place.

R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Um, do you have any -- any specific views or --
R:  About what?

R:  Ah, I think they really [several inaudible words] their own self, ah, discipline --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and they really -- they really discovering -- oh, I got idea, why don't -- why let those kind of people smoke [several inaudible words] watching [several inaudible words] lung cancer movie [NOISE], see how [several inaudible words] people who have lung cancer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, they grad- -- they gradually -- um, they lost their life in the end.  Ah, maybe even better idea that they're letting people see the -- what the lung cancer look like on a film.
L:  Yeah, I think that'll --
R:  [several inaudible words] -- let em see that lung cancer -- what look like -- [several inaudible words] in, ah, those kind of thing.  Learning watching those films. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  My mother was dying -- my mother was dying of lung cancer.

R:  Yeah.  Ah, that was a long, long time ago.  I was there maybe twenty years ago [several inaudible words] in April [several inaudible words] pretty warm [several inaudible words] and, ah, I was there for the convention[?] and, ah -- ah, with my -- my parents and I really didn't have a chance to discover what's, ah, Savannah looked like, but ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was an ice trip anyway.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] It's a -- it's a nice -- it's a nice city, but --

R:  Huh?
L:  For ten minutes.
R:  Okay.  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Um, I -- I don't know, maybe -- maybe your idea that -- I think that's a good idea that -- that if they sat peop- -- if they sat people down and let them see exactly what smoking could do to them.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That -- maybe some kind of the autopsy -- [several inaudible words] lung cancer people they die [several inaudible words] autopsy and they open the -- the body and then -- then [several inaudible words] film and then they can see what it -- their lung really look like and what a cancer will do to you -- ah, can cause, ah, [several inaudible words] in the body. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I think that's a real good idea.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Either that or if it doesn't -- if it doesn't register, it sure will scare em. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know to -- to think that that's actually happening to them.
R:  What -- what have you got to do with, ah, Pennsylvania University -- this researchy[?] thing?
L:  In where?
R:  I said, what have you got to do with this -- ah, this research thing?  [inaudible]. [NOISE]
L:  Um -- well, I just -- I, um -- I -- I looked it up, it was on the internet.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  And I thought -- you know, I like to --
R:  Well, wh- what address?  What address did you look it up? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I'm not -- I don't -- I forgot the address, so I'm not -- I don't remember it right now. [NOISE]
R:  I like to participate if you get paid for. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, you -- you supposedly -- um [several inaudible words] -- you're supposed to get paid like ten dollars for ten minutes or something like that.
R:  Yeah.  How about you?
L:  Um --
R:  Are you -- are you get paid also?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Ho- -- ah, okay, let's go back to the --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- what -- what -- what do -- what do you think is a good idea -- the -- ah, to tell the people -- persuade them smoking is good -- or it's bad for the health? [NOISE]
L:  Um --
R:  You have any suggestion?
L:  Well, I'm -- [SIGH] I'm not sure, like I said, but I thought what you said was a pretty good idea, but um they've been telling people for so long --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, that all the stuff that cigarettes are laced with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, you know, all kind of stuff like that.  So, I mean, if -- I figure that'll probably be the only way, you know, that they'll actually listen if -- and they were to actually see for themselves, you know?
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  [NOISE] Well, let me tell you this --
L:  [COUGH] I'm sorry?
R:  -- let me tell you this [several inaudible words] once, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] if that's the way they want to do -- they're choosing to damage their health -- their heal- health, it's their own choice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Why other people have to worry about those people.  It's their own body. [NOISE]
L:  I know.  But I mean, um --
R:  Ah, but certainly I don't want to smell like -- [several inaudible words] smoke that ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I mean, not just that -- you know, they're not only damaging themselves, they're damaging everyone around them, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially the children, they -- they get the worse end of it, because secondhand smoke is the most deadliest.  Um, you know, if you don't [COUGH] -- if you don't care too much about your [COUGH] own health, at least, you know, be -- be courteous to the people that are around you.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  And also it makes my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my clothing and my hair smell bad also.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] It really does.
R:  What do you do?
