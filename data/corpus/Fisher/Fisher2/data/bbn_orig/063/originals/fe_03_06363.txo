L:  [MN] Hello?
R:  Hello.  Uh, my name is Mary.
L:  And my name is Sherrie[?]. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Um --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Wisconsin.
L:  Wisconsin?  Well, I'm from Georgia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And how are you tonight?
R:  Um, good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about smoking --
L:  Smoking.
R:  -- and -- well, first in public places, huh?  Banning 'em?
L:  Well, I don't smoke.  Do you?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, we probably got pretty strong opinions about it.
L:  Well, I lived --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- with a smoker for about thirty years, he finally quit, but I think it should be banned in public places.  What do you think?
R:  Um, well, I smoked for probably thirty years, but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've quit now for ten.  Um, [COUGH] I think i- if it can be segregated it should be allowed, but if it can't, it should be forbidden.
L:  Well, now, I agree with that, but I think that just having this -- this side of the room is -- is no smoking and this side of the room is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smoking doesn't --
R:  No.
L:  -- get it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because there's no way that this side of the room with no smoking --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- doesn't have smoke, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, yeah, sometimes the people that don't smoke smell the worst, huh?
L:  That's true too. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  But, I mean, you know, it -- it, ah, what their reasoning is behind that just amazes me. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, it's the writer. [PAUSE] I- is that what you mean?
L:  M- -- well, I mean the -- the fact that how can they think that there isn't going to get -- be smoke on the no smoking side.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I mean, if you're in one big room and one side's smoking and one's non smoking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the smoke is going to travel in the whole room --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it may be not as bad on the no smoking side, but still, you're still going to get smoke.
R:  Mhm.  And I don't think there's very many places that, yeah, you can be segregated from the -- from the others --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- without having the others smell it.
L:  That's true.  I mean, even if you have totally separate rooms, most of the time the air conditioning and heating vents are all connected, so therefore you still basically get -- basically get the same air being circulated.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  Well, yeah, I know sometimes we put up with it, and you must have put up with it a lot with your husband, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- --
L:  I mean, you know, it really doesn't bother me because of that, I guess, uh, but I really think that a smoker is imposing his view on another person by smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, in a restaurant --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know --
R:  Yeah, you can get used to the smell.
L:  -- they have rights too. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah, I realize they got rights --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- but, you know, when it's affecting our health though --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you know, and it's -- it's really proven that it's affecting our health.
L:  And, you know, most of the time when you hear of someone that has lung cancer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's usually not a smoker.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
L:  A- and they use that as -- as their [MN] counter suit, I guess you might say.  They say, "Well, you know, look at so and so, he didn't even smoke" and then, "Look at so and so over here and he smoked for forty five years".
R:  And he still doesn't have it. [COUGH]
L:  And he still doesn't have cancer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  And -- so what can you say? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  At times, yeah, it's a lot of denial.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or, uh --
L:  It's a lot of -- of just a sign --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- why they're smoking too.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I --
R:  All right.
L:  -- do think that -- that -- the -- the ad campaigns and -- and all -- all of the publicity about not smoking is maybe keeping teenagers from smoking.  I don't think teenagers smoke quite as bad as they did.  I don't know what your age is, but I'm sixty.
R:  Mm.
L:  In my day, teenagers, it was cool to smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't th- -- I don't think it is now, among young people.
R:  Yeah, I quit smoking when my daughter was a teenager, so I didn't allow smoking in the house but, you know, once she got out of the house, she started smoking.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and so --
L:  That --
R:  -- did my older son.
L:  Do they still smoke?
R:  Um, yes. [SIGH] Yeah, they haven't realized -- the one doesn't as much, but I got a thirteen year old, and of course, I'm not going to let him smoke either, but, [LAUGH] um --
L:  But you don't know what they do when they're not at home.
R:  Right.  Yeah, but h- -- you know, I don't smoke in my house, but we're divorced, and I'm sure he's smelling it at his Dad's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as he's a -- really a heavy smoker.
L:  W- --
R:  But, you know, when I did smoke --
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- you don't realize that, you know, you think, "Oh, just 'cause the smoke isn't going in their face, you know?  It's not, it's okay".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's kinda naive.
L:  Yeah, it's really not.
R:  Yeah.  So, I think it's good that they're getting that taught in school.   You know, I don't remember getting taught in school that much.
L:  I don't -- I don't remember it being taught at all when I was in school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, even in -- well, we didn't have as many health classes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as we do n- -- you know --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- I think they do now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I don't remember that being --
R:  Which is a good thing.
L:  -- a subject at all --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in the health classes.
R:  Mhm.  But I wish they would have had that baby class when I was in high school. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's good too.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Um, now, that smoke -- that second part of that question, whether we believe in [LIPSMACK] the ads and smoking programs, was it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- would be beneficial?
L:  Would be -- i- i- if it is being beneficial.
R:  Oh.  Um, are you aware of smoking programs, or --
L:  [SIGH] Other than just the, um, you know, the -- like the programs on TV, you know, the ads about, you know, not smoking and --
R:  N- not --
L:  -- and, you know, the ads you see in the newspapers, that sort of thing --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't think there's actually any programs in the school system, at least not here.
R:  No, I don't think so either.
L:  That's, um --
R:  The Annual Smoke Out.
L:  Yeah, now, there's that.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I remember sending for a kit from them guys, you know?  But I had to take the initiative to do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But [SIGH] --
L:  Do you think it helped you?
R:  Um ... do I think it helped me?  Not as much -- well, you know what helped me was, um, a tape, um, a tape saying how icky it was.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Right.  So, I think probably, yeah.  Um, because that's kinda like a program.
L:  Well, that'd be true.
R:  Yeah, it's not -- was -- it wasn't only my willpower.  You know, I just kept listening to that tape and every time it said, you know, um, "I can do it", I just kept saying, u- um --"
L:  I can do it. [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, "God can help me do it". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I didn't -- it wasn't all my doing. [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Did you use any -- any, uh, like the patches or anything like that?
R:  No, I didn't.  But --
L:  Well, my husband didn't either, he just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- quit cold turkey.  Now, every once in a while, he will still pick up one, but it's just one every once in a while, that's all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just --
R:  Yeah, now it just makes me sick just smelling it.
L:  They say it's very hard to quit if you've ever smoked, that it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- more of an addiction that you realize.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think it was easy, I did it lots of times. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, yeah, the --
L:  Well, thank goodness I never started.  I just -- that never appealed to me, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of people in my generation did.
R:  Mm.  It didn't make you sick at all, you got used to it, uh?
L:  Mhm, I got used to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now, oh, one thing, I -- well, we've got three boys and that's one thing that -- that Jimmy's smoking did accomplish.  None of them smoke.
R:  Oh.
L:  They can't stand -- or they didn't even want to sit behind him in the van, because the smoke would seem like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it drifted right in their face.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's the one thing he did accomplish --
R:  [COUGH]
L: -- by smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was that none of the boys smoked.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  They think it's -- it's, [MN] you know, terrible.
R:  Wow.
L:  And they kept on him and on him to quit, and he was finally diagnosed a -- a diabetic --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, oh, they told him that smoking definitely aggravated that and I think that is probably the key to why he finally quit.
R:  Okay.  So, it was education and, uh, that smoking had an effect on it?
L:  That's true, mhm.
R:  So, that's a form of --
L:  So, that's a form of, um --
R:  -- education, yeah.
L:  A program, I guess, mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Uh, um, hm. [PAUSE]
L:  But thank goodness I've -- [COUGH] excuse me, thank goodness I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- never started.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They do say though it's very hard to quit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How --
R:  Um --
L:  -- is this your first, uh, first talk or second, third or fourth?
R:  Mm, this is my third.
L:  Third?  Mine too.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I had perjury and, um, mm, what's the other one? [LAUGH] Oh, what you would have changed --
L:  Oh, well --
R:  -- if you were younger, if you could go back.
L:  I had virtual reality shows --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then the second one was about what sports do you watch on TV.
R:  What sports?
L:  Sports.
R:  Oh.
L:  What type of sports, and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I don't watch any --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so try talking ten minutes on that, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And it was with a man --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- too, no less, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And of course he did --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- watch 'em.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, good, he at least did most of the talking then, uh? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, that was a bad match up --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I had one with a little fifteen year old girl, saying what you could change into your life.  Well, that was interesting.  She couldn't go back further.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, hopefully my insight helped her, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, she can go on [LAUGH] and learn some new things, but --
L:  So, there's no age limit on the -- on the program then?
R:  Oh, yeah, that -- that surprised me, that she was so young.
L:  Hm.
R:  But, you know, I think, uh, hearing from an older one may -- that she doesn't know, maybe had some influence, I don't know.
L:  Maybe -- maybe it did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe that's like -- like with the smoking programs, you know, peer pressure makes you start and -- and --
