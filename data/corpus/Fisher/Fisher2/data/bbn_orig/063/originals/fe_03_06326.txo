L:  Hello, my name is Kaye[?].
R:  Hi, ah, my name is Esther[?].  How are you?
L:  Well, I'm just fine, Esther and how are you today?
R:  Ah, hanging in there.  Well, rain, rain, rain but --
L:  Oh, here too. [LAUGH]
R:  But [LAUGH] I can't tell -- I just got home from work, it feels good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um how do you feel about what they said with the smoking?  Ah, do you feel it's right to tell people not to smoke?
L:  Well, I don't feel that it's right to tell em not to smoke, but yet being a non smoker with asthma myself --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I'm glad to see the restaurants having non smoking sections.
R:  Have you ever smoked in your life at all?
L:  Oh, I think once or twice I had one or two, but that was it.
R:  I -- I mean, I used to when I was, ah, much younger.  I must have -- because it was fashionable back in the sixties.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  The ads promoted it, you know, they -- they had -- it was -- it just went with restaurants and parties and, ah, I ended up with pneumonia and since I had that, back in the eighties, I have not touched a cigarette and I've really -- people tell me, "How could you be so adamant against it, if you were a smoker?" but I feel, "Yes, it's your choice, but why should I be breathing this in now, because I am aware of lung problems and things?".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And yet I get such anger from people because I'm brushing the smoke away from my face and, I don't know, how do you -- how do you react when people get nasty with you?
L:  Well, I've never had anybody really get nasty, nasty but I've had em ask, "You know, well it's my privilege, why can't I do this?" but --
R:  What do you say to them?
L:  -- I tell them, "Yes, it is your privilege but I choose not to associate while you're doing this, because I see ads on TV, I see -- I saw both parents die of cancer --"
R:  Oh, my God.  Yeah.
L:  "-- none of them lung, but -- and I see the effects of second hand smoke".
R:  Right.  And it's -- they say it's worse for the non smoker than it is for somebody that does smoke.
L:  I believe it is, because I have a friend who has lung cancer who has never smoked in her life.
R:  It has to be from the chemi- -- of chemicals in the air or -- and if they know this is contaminating your health, I don't understand why it's being done.  In my day, we didn't have that information.
L:  No --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- they -- I -- I think they -- and they may have had it -- the manufacturers had it, but they suppressed it.
R:  Uh-huh.  Good point.  Money.  Money.
L:  And -- and then now, you know -- yeah, money's money that's right.  And now the kids, they can see the dangers but it's still cool to them, they think that's great --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  -- the boy thinks he's sexy if he's standing there with a cigarette dripping of his lip, you know, but who would like to kiss those lips that just --
R:  And the smell --
L:  -- smoked that cigarette?
R:  -- I didn't realise.  We have a ban at my school, no smoking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and yet I see them running out looking like +criminals  -- criminals to grab a smoke.
L:  Oh, yes and as soon as they walk in you know that's what they've done --
R:  And they stink.
L:  -- because it just clings to their clothes.
R:  Yeah, they stink.  Ah, I was going to also ask you, do you think the government has a responsibility to put an ad campaign or to just stop people or stop the production of cigarettes if they know this?
L:  I would think they would, because to me, the cigarette is just as harmful, maybe more harmful to you, than a drug --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they go after people with the marijuana, they go after people --
R:  [COUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  -- with the crack.  To me, the cigarette is just another form of that.
R:  And it's just as addictive.
L:  Oh, it's really addictive from what I've seen of people and it's getting very expensive and a lot of people who do smoke are maybe the lower level income --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they'll do anything to get the money for their cigarettes because to them that is like a drug.
R:  I -- I laugh because I listen to someone in the family, I don't want to go into details --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but she just got over breast cancer.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  She's got -- they're watching her heart now and she went through the treatments and everything.  Being so aware of that kind of -- what -- what you could do to your body by smoking, do you believe that she is still smoking?  I can't believe this.
L:  I do believe that, because my mother, to her dying day, and my mother in law both said they had two vices, "They like their diet Coke and they like their cigarettes" --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- and -- and one of my mother in law's other daughters -- I mean, [several inaudible words] mother in law, but the daughter would stand there and hold the cigarette to her mother's mouth while she smoked it in the hospital and I thought, "You're killing her --"
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  "-- you're killing her faster".
R:  Yeah, I get the story, "Well, if this thing don't get me -- I've given up everything --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- why -- why can't --?".  I says, "But -- but you've been on your death bed --
L:  Yes.
R:  "-- and you know what cigarettes will do.  You've been monitored with your heart" --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and yet, I -- I -- how -- how could you get -- how could they help people?
L:  My -- my father had -- he smoked --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then he had -- he had a lot of heart attacks and he had to have open heart surgery and he went to a Doctor Devreese in Louisville who was at that time, was the best, he had done the [inaudible] heart, the first one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he did that first heart -- open -- open heart surgery --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and, you know, like explained the heart was in bad condition, but my dad lived through it and he did great and he quit smoking --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- right then and there.  Two yeas later he had to have another open heart surgery and we were concerned because of his age and all this and that, and Dr Devreese said, "Even though that the heart was badly damaged, within those two years it had started to heal itself because it was not smoking".
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, I didn't know that was possible --
R:  I didn't know.
L:  -- but it did it.
R:  I knew with the lungs --
L:  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  -- from what I'd studied that they regenerate, and they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- turn pink again.  We've looked at lungs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, even in school I've shown the kids the- -- they have actual lungs that look like they would just fall apart --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- they're black.
L:  -- yes, they are.
R:  And then they show lungs that -- people who have stopped smoking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they've turned normal colors.
L:  They do.  They do.  My --
R:  You know?  It comes back.  But with the heart I never heard of it.
L:  No.  When my -- when my dad had his open heart surgery, my sister was a heavy smoker --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- me and my mom we'd go shopping and oh, my God after you shopped you had to stop and had to have a cigarette and it wasted so much --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- time, but she was a heavy smoker and when my dad had his surgery she had to have a hysterectomy and she had that and she woke up --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and she quit, cold turkey.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And she told me later on, she said, "It was hard" but she saw -- she saw what dad went through and then she told me, she said, "I -- I've regained my sense of taste".  She said, "I never knew that food tasted so good".
R:  Mhm.
L:  She said, "I've regained my sense of smell".  She said, "I never smelled myself" she said, "Did I smell like that when I smoked?".
R:  Oh, you can smell -- oh --
L:  I said, "Oh, yeah.  You did and your house and everything" --
R:  -- uh-huh.
L:  You know, I don't think smokers realise that, because they're around it all the time.  To them, that's how it's supposed to be.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But it must affect all your senses because she said she really got --
R:  It's another good point.
L:  -- her sense of taste back.  Yeah.
R:  So, what can be done to stop --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people from destr- -- well, it's like fighting the drug war.
L:  Right.  I think -- I think the showing of the lungs and I think showing this to kids would impact them more than just an ad on TV saying, "No, don't do this.  Blah, blah, blah" because --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they're not going to pay attention.  They think, "Oh, it's not going to happen to me, it's going to happen to somebody else" and they keep on going.
R:  And they do still --
L:  It has to be their choice.
R:  Right.  And so it has to be just like it would be as an addiction with somebody that has a problem with any other substance or anything else?
L:  I think so.  Just like AA or something like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- until that person wants to do it, you can talk till you're blue in the face and you're not going to change --
R:  And they're gong to keep --
L:  -- their minds.
R:  I -- I mean, I can't understand it.  I -- I -- only one time, when my daughter was giving birth, my -- I had a friend that was with us, my daughter's best friend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and yet she was more my age but that was my daughter's best friend and she k- -- was so nervous when she was giving birth, that she was smoking.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  She kept running out for a smoke.  Running out.  We were up at NYU.  She works at NYU hospital and, ah, I saw it and my nerves were so bad, I said, "Give me a puff" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I hadn't smo- -- I took one pu- -- she says, "Take a cigarette".  I li- -- I said, "Take this back".  The taste -- I couldn't believe that I was actually paying money to do this -- th- -- ah, I said, "What am I doing?" --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but what does it take people?  It took me, ah, you know, getting sick.
L:  It does.  There's an ad on TV right now that shows two little boys and the one a little older than the other and he's talking to his father about second hand smoke and he said, "When I was young --"
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I had to, you know, smell this" he said "and I couldn't talk for myself".  He said, "Now I've got this little brother and he can't talk for himself, but I can --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I'm asking you to quit smoking because it is hurting us".  When I see a mother --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with a little baby and she's standing there smoking a cigarette and the baby's face is like two inches away from hers, I'm thinking --
R:  I can't -- I can't comprehend that.  I can't --
L:  No, that little baby's lungs are so small they can't handle the everyday pollution let alone adding to it.
R:  And the nu- -- e- even sometimes it's not even the mother.  When -- even with my daughter -- we actually had to tell people that do smoke, "You can't do that in this house".
L: No.
R:  And yet the- -- even the thought that they went into their bag and got ready to pull out a cigarette with the newborn baby, it's -- it's idiotic, I don't comprehend.
L:  I -- I don't either, but I don't -- like I've said, they don't --
R:  But me preaching --
L:  -- think they're doing any harm.
R:  But they pre- -- they don't think.
L:  No.
R:  So -- so, what d- -- I guess it's just showing them the pictures.
L:  I think.  I -- if I was a smoker and somebody showed me the -- one black lung and the one good lung, you better believe I'd go for the good lung --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of course I think -- you --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you sound a little older and I'm a little older and I think we've just gotten more sense.  They think they have their whole life ahead of them and they don't realise how fast that life goes and how short it can be.
R:  That's right.  It's what they do with their foundations --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- because, yes
