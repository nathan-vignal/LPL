L:  Hello, I'm Sharon.
R:  Hi, Sharon.  Where are you from? [NOISE]
L:  I'm in Maryland.
R:  Oh, and I'm -- my name is Vi[?] and I'm in, ah, Arkansas.
L:  Oh, very good.  Okay.
R:  Well, this is going to be interesting, ah, depending on whether or not you smoke.
L:  I do not smoke.  I have never smoked in my life.
R:  Oh, I --
L:  I grew up with parents who were extremely heavy smokers and I think I have bronchitis --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm forty one now, oops there goes my age.  Um [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, and because of the heavy smoking that I was exposed to as a child --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, they did -- they actually went through --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hypnosis, um, let's see I guess when I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I was -- when I still lived at home.  I was probably about fourteen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and that worked for them.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, um -- and that helped con- considerably, they both went through that but ah I would really -- I'm really happy, especially now that I have two young children, that there is no smoking in public, you know, places and, you know, I'm -- it -- it just -- now, it just curls my to- -- you know, "Ugh".  I mean, I just pass people who smoke and I'm like, "Ugh.  Yuck".
R:  Well, yeah I -- I can understand how you feel.  Now, I -- I am a smoker --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I am -- I -- I did give it up, I had heart surgery --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, about twelve years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I did give it up then and for ten years I did not smoke.
L:  Wow.
R:  I -- it -- and it was really -- it was very difficult to give it up.  If you've never smoked, you really can't understand --
L:  No.
R:  -- that you're really addicted to it, but um --
L:  Well, I have a weight problem so --
R:  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  -- I -- it's like asking me to give up my chocolate chip cookies, I can imagine.  You know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's -- it would be very similar and I can understand how hard -- that's why -- I know my parents were very successful with going through hypnosis --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they both did it together --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I think that was very helpful for them too.
R:  And they both were able to stop?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.
L:  Um, the -- the only thing is that my brother had just gotten his drivers license at the time and so the Popeye's Chicken place was right up the corner --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] so they would -- they would pay him an extra -- go get some -- you know, because food tasted so much better apparently --
R:  Ye- -- well, yeah.
L:  -- once they stopped smoking.  I don't know if you've had that experience or not.
R:  Well, course -- ah, food just tastes good to me all the time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and, ah, even with the smoking I -- I -- I could stand to lose a few pounds, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's -- ah, I would hate to think now if I were to try to stop again.  I don't know why I started after that length of time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah --
L:  Was it a stressful period of your life or ...?
R:  Well, ah, not particularly.  It just -- I -- I just picked up a cigarette and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all of my children smoke, ah, so of course when -- they're -- they're all grown and out of the house by now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they come over every week, on Mondays we always get together and I'll have dinner for them and, ah, everybody smokes and I just go right ahead with them and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I really -- I know I shouldn't, it's not good for me.  Well, we all know why -- why we shouldn't smoke, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but ah -- and expensive now.  Of course, you probably don't even know how much a -- ah, cigarettes cost because you don't have any ah -- ah, do you ever see them see advertised?  I just wondered --
L:  I have, I seen em -- I guess I was com- commenting just for the fact that when I was little I remember going to the grocery store --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my mother getting a carton of cigarettes for like, nine, ten dollars.
R:  Oh, yes [LAUGH] -- well, I remember those days too [several inaudible words] --
L:  You know?  Ah -- um, but -- and I -- I guess we [several inaudible words] you know, we were travelling and cigarettes on sale, thirty dollars a carton. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Well, I wondered if -- if different states -- ah, I think when -- when they have them on sale, the name brands are -- are like twenty seven sixty five a carton, but w- -- they've just passed a law here in Arkansas where they're going to be putting another charge on them, another -- an additional two fifty a carton --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, when you -- and I -- I don't buy them by the carton anymore.  I buy a couple of packs at a time and I try to make two packs last for four days --
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  -- but I'm not a- -- well, I'm not -- I'm not always successful, but I -- my -- my boys have to bring cigarettes to me.  I don't drive anymore and so they try to put the kibosh on me, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  "You -- you've hard your share, you know, wait another day or two" and there's [LAUGH] not much I can do about it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But -- yeah.
L:  Now, when you go somewhere -- say, do you -- go to restaurants, do you feel prohibited from smoking or -- or do you -- you know, do you feel put out that you have to step outside or ...?
R:  Well, we don't have to do that.  So far, in Arkansas, all of the restaurants have -- have smoking sections --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so we -- we usually go to those.  But there is a -- ah, some talk going on now where they want to, ah -- ah, ban smoking in all restaurants, all public buildings etcetera and I -- you know, I really do enjoy while -- while you're sitting there after you've ordered -- you know, sit and drink your cocktail and have a cigarette, I really do enjoy that cigarette --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with that drink.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't know what's going to happen if they do that.  I -- I know that all of us smokers are in the minority now so, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they may just pass that.
L:  I know, um, in a county next to ours, Montgomery County, they had passed that re- -- all restaurants and all bars could not have smoking anymore.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Now, that actually got overturned because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they didn't do it properly through some legal channel or whatever, but they're really pushing for any public -- I know all public buildings --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- especially in our area now, there's no -- absolutely no smoking.  Um, you know, most restaurants ha- -- yeah, they have a smoking section --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and usually that is -- like we go to Outback every -- you know, once every other month when we can afford it --
R:  Oh, you -- you have an Outback too, uh-huh?
L:  Yeah and there's only the bar that you can smoke at.
R:  Oh.
L:  That bar section, you know?  That's the only place in the whole restaurant, um, everything else is considered no smoking now.
R:  Well --
L:  Um, and, you know, a lot of them are -- are -- yeah and -- and smokers are in the minority at this point I think, because people, um, you know, in my mind are hoping or getting the message that smoking is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is it's hor- -- you know, it's -- not, you know, contributing to your health and, um, I guess I saw an elderly aunt who had to have her voice box removed --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- due to some cancer of the throat and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, and how she had to have this little thing put up to her -- to talk even because --
R:  Is -- yes, I know what that is.  I've seen that.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and, ah, so, unfortunately I'm a -- you know, I -- I would be happy to see it not in public places.  Unfortunately, you know, it puts -- puts you all out, literally, in the street [LAUGH] but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, you know, it -- it's -- it's difficult when -- it is a habit -- okay, say, you know, I'm not allowed to eat my chocolate chip cookies anymore --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- "You can't have em anymore, you have to go out on the street and eat em" you know --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- I -- I would probably be kind of offended.  Well, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- if I'm fat, I want to be fat.  That's my choice to be fat.
R:  Y- -- that -- I -- I know what it is when you -- you get a craving for something and that's the way it is with cigarettes, with me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah -- ah, now -- I -- I guess if -- if, ah, I couldn't get any I -- I couldn't smoke and I -- I know that I can manage it, because I've done it but it -- it just is -- I -- I feel [SIGH] -- there's a kind of a satisfaction that I get when I -- in fact, I'm smoking right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have a cigarette in my hand --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it while it's terrible it -- it really is, I know all of the bad parts about it, but I still -- still am at it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and ah, oh dear.
L:  Do you mind if I ask how old you are?
R:  No.  I'm seventy four.
L:  Wow, well bless your heart.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There you go -- well, see, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- some people think that's there -- th- -- why they're living so long, so ...  Ah, look at George Burns he was what, a hundred years old --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and you know he --
R:  And he --
L:  -- had a cigar every day.
R:  -- his cigars.  That's right.  Yeah.  I, ah -- I just figure maybe if I were younger I would think of -- of the future a little bit more, but I figure I have lived a nice long life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I really -- oh, I -- I have that kind of dry smokers cough every once in awhile.  You know, you have to sort of clear your throat, but I figure, boy that's one of the -- the things that satisfies me and there aren't that [inaudible] of things [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- left at this age.  So, I -- I continue smoking.
L:  But see that -- I also have that cough and people have always asked me --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- doctors always ask me, "Why -- you know, do you smoke?  Have you ever s- ?".  I have never smoked, but my lungs have been damaged due to --
R:  Second hand smoke.
L:  -- all the smoke that I was exposed to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- growing up and, um, you know, bec- -- it's funny, because every time I get a really bad case of bronchitis and the one time I actually landed in hospital because of it and, um, they're like, "Oh, you must be a smoker".  I'm like, "I have never smoked a day in my life" you know?
R:  Never smoked a -- never even tried it --
L:  No.
R:  -- when you were a teenager?
L:  I was a very boring teenager.  I was a -- that  girl scout and the [LAUGH] you know, I didn't even really drink until I was like -- "Oh, eighteen was legal, so okay I guess" and --
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  I wa- -- yeah, I was a goody goody, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But um I have a sixteen year old stepson who has asthma -- childhood asthma growing up very badly --
R:  Oh, yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I've -- I've always said to him, "Well, you know smoking will kill you" um, you know, it's a little bit of unfair brain washing probably but I -- you know, I'm really afraid for him being -- having the asthma and knowing ahead, you know what I mean, that it could cause him life long problems.
R:  What the consequences could be.  Yeah, I can understand that.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, if -- well, if he doesn't smoke, that's great --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, and I can understand -- now, I -- I had bronchitis when I was a youngster, um, my mother never smoked but my dad did now that I recall --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but ah I -- I don't know whether that was part of -- of getting that second hand smoke.  You know, many years ago they -- there wasn't that much talk about smoking --
L:  No.
R:  -- and the damage it could cause and the second
