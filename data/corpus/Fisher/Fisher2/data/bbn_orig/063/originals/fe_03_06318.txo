R:  Hello.  My name i- is Leah[?].  I live in New York, United States.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  Hi, Leah.  And so our topic is smoking?
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Do you smoke?
R:  No.  How about you, do you smoke?
L:  No, I don't smoke.  Um, I'm -- actually, today's my birthday --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm sixty years old today but I did smoke when I was young --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in my late teens.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I gave it up, thank goodness.  I --
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- actually, I learned how to smoke when I was seven --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- but I never really -- I never really enjoying the smoke --
L:  No.
R:  -- and I -- the smoke made me feel like my head dizzy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah I hated the smell on my clothing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my hair.
L:  I on- -- I kind of only smoked because other teenagers did.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  But um the question was, um, about banning --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smoking in public places.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Here where I live you are not allowed to smoke in restaurants.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Like we --
L:  Is it like that in New York?
R:  Yes.
L:  It's like --
R:  It's pretty much, ah, [several inaudible words] in United States right now --
L:  Is it really?
R:  -- by some of the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, by some of the -- even the -- ah, I don't know about, ah, bars, but ah, I knew some of the casino places in Los Angeles they banned the smoke in public. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because of the -- um, it's -- it's very bad for the other people -- they -- who they don't smoke and if they have to smell the second hand smoke, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I've known people that have gotten cancer from second hand smoke, so --
R:  Yeah, my mother had lung cancer.
L:  Yeah, so it definitely is, ah, a health problem.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, here I think -- I think you can -- ah, quite a number of the restaurants have -- have a -- if they have a bar, it has to be separate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from the restaurant --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then there's smoking in there.  But we're not allowed to smoke in hospitals, in any public buildings here.
R:  That's good.  That's good.
L:  Yeah, it has -- ah, I don't -- I don't know if that's Canada wide or just for our province --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but ah --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And I even notice, you know, where I live, more and more people --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- if they have someone who smokes in their family --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they go outside.  Like you see them outside, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I know.
L:  Where as years ago, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where I worked when I was young --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- everybody I worked with smoked and you went to work in a car and everybody smoked and I don't know how we put up with it --
R:  I know.
L:  -- because your clothes smell, your hair smells, ah [LAUGH] you know?
R:  [several inaudible words] in New York there's a lot of this, ah -- a building, like co-op condo, the [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- family and they in the big building --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] they don't smoke indoor but they just -- just smoke back in the stairway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hate that -- it -- whole building smells.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  I guess the whole thing is, you know, if you smoke for years and years and years it's very hard to quit.
R:  Is any -- anybody in your family smoke also?
L:  Um, my brother did smoke but he has many health problems --
R:  Oh, really.  How old is he right now?
L:  He's fifty six, almost fifty six --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, he was told, you know, that he had to quit but --
R:  [NOISE] You think that his health is related to the smoke?
L:  Well, I don't think the health was related to the smoke, but the doctor said, "If you don't quit, then the smoking --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- you know, it's going to -- it -- it will be a -- a hindrance to your problems".
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And, ah --
R:  Is he married?
L:  Yeah and his wife wa- -- they were both heavy, heavy smokers but --
R:  Well, no wonder.
L:  -- his wife had a -- a blood clot earlier this year and she was still smoking.
R:  How old is she?
L:  She's, ah -- ah sixty.
R:  Oh.
L:  And the doctor said, you know, "You've got to quit smoking because --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- blood clots are sometimes caused by smoking".
R:  Also, how does she know she has a blood clot?
L:  Well, she was very -- her leg -- in her leg.
R:  Oh, into her vein, huh?
L:  She had to go to the hospital and they said the blood clot could travel -- but they said, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- "Smoking is not good for [several inaudible words]".
R:  Is it -- would she feel pain or what?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she had pain, but --
R:  And, ah -- um -- um, perhaps that's why they -- they married each other because they got the same kind of, ah, hobby.
L:  Well, they have a lot of problems, you know?  And ah they get stressed out and so, you know, they smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's addi- -- it's an addiction.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Ah, yeah, an addiction.  Yeah.
L:  So, they -- and I think that's the way -- there's with lot of people and then a lot of young people get hooked on smoking, but um --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's a big debate because ah -- it's a -- it's a -- a big industry there's -- you know, there's a lot of money to be made by cigarettes --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and, ah, for -- in our country, for a long time too, there was smuggling --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of cigarettes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't know a whole lot about that but that was -- um, it was something the government had to deal with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then they put, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they put big taxes on cigarettes, like it's very expensive to smoke.
R:  Ah, yeah.  It is too and it's --
L:  I don't what -- how much -- do you know how much a pack of cigarettes costs in New York?  I don't know.
R:  I -- I don't know, I never buy cigarettes --
L:  No, me either, but I --
R:  -- so I [inaudible] --
L:  -- I know they're a lot more here but like it's not cheap.  It's -- you're spending a lot of money --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- if you smoke.
R:  Well, I tell you it's a lot of people -- or quite a -- quite a lot of my girlfriends smoke --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they have a lot wrinkles though, so it looks horrible though.
L:  Oh, I know.  You look at any woman that has smoked for years and years and years, her skin is terrible --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  What -- what cause the [inaudible]?
L:  Well, apparently it takes something out of your -- your skin.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I've heard -- I've heard doctors talk about it.  It -- it takes something out of your skin.  I mean, the smoke --
R:  Uh-huh.

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- teeth yellow.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It affects your breath, it makes your breath stink. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  How -- how did you know that this part- -- ah, [inaudible] program?
L:  Ah, how did I find out about this?  From my daughter.  My daughter lives in the States.
R:  Oh, where? [NOISE]

R:  Yeah, I wa- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] to prevent people, ah, smoke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My suggestion is, ah, perhaps those people dying of lung cancer related to smoking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they autopsy, then cut up the body and they film [several inaudible words] body and then the people watching this.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they have lots of commercials, you know, here on the TV, very, very -- I mean, the commercials that are on TV would make me not want to smoke --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- but they -- and they have lots of programs in the schools.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There was just -- there was a lady, um, I don't know where she was from but she ha- -- she'd smoked for years and she was a young woman --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like maybe in her forties or so.  And she's been going around to the schools, ah, you know, her head's bald because she had to go through chemotherapy --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she has lung cancer and actually she just died this week.  But she'd gone to the schools and talked to thousands and thousands of youth and said, "Don't -- don't smoke, this is what you -- will happen to you if you smoke" but they said even when she was sick she was still smoking.
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  She couldn't quit, but she figured --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- "Well, what's the point of me quitting?" you know, "I'm dying".  But it was just on TV this week.
R:  [several inaudible words] -- that's interesting, one of my -- you talk about even she die and she won't quit.  One of my friends, her husband he gamble a lot [several inaudible words] --
