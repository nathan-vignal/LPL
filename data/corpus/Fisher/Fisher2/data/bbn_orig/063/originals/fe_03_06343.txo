R:  This is Jay.
L:  Hi, I'm Genie.
R:  Hi Genie, this is Jay, how are you?
L:  I'm fine thanks.  [LIPSMACK]  And I --
R:  Great.
L:  I am definitely against smoking.
R:  You and me both.
L:  Good!  [LAUGH]
R:  Believe it or not, I used to smoke when I was back in college and, uh, I fell asleep one night smoking, and I almost burned my dorm room down, so --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- that was pretty much enough for me to stop --
L:  Uh!
R:  -- from then on!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  You learned early, huh?  That's good.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  That's good.
R:  And then the bad, uh, my father, he smoked for about thirty five years, and he died of lung cancer, and that pretty much really kinda nailed the coffin in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for that one there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Pretty much, and --
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  So, pretty much -- uh, where are you calling in?  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm from Southern Chester County.
R:  Uh, okay, I'm all the way down in Atlanta Georgia.
L:  Oh my gosh!
R:  Yeah, that's what I say!  Huh.
L:  Well, how about that.  Well, I -- I'm in Southern Chester County in Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.  All right.
L:  So I'm not that far from the University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Uh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I went to [inaudible], I went to school of business a couple of years ago for some, uh, business classes there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Many moons ago.
L:  Uh, many moons ago, yes.
R:  Many moons ago.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Well, we've had a couple of experiences with smoking too, that have definitely turned us off of smoking.  My -- my husband used to smoke, he was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a heavy smoker, but he -- he quit because he watched his father die of emphysema.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.
L:  My father died of heart disease, which smoking was a contributor to.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yow!  [NOISE]
L:  And, uh, my mother has emphysema.
R:  Yow!  Ooh!
L:  His mother has emphysema from secondhand smoke.
R:  Phew!  Yow!  Okay!
L:  And my daughters --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  One of my daughter's very best friend was killed in a fire that was caused by someone falling asleep with a cigarette.
R:  Oh my God.  Well, see, that's --
L:  And his dorm room at Quitstown[?] University here in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, ouch!
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's -- yeah --
L:  So --
R:  So we both have had experiences of enough to say, "Huh, smoking, no good.  Thank you very much".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right, right, exactly.  And --
R:  Definitely.
L:  I think -- I think all the campaigns for anti smoking really do help the kids of today.
R:  Yeah, definitely, 'cause, I mean, kids just seem to start at a younger age.  It's like [inaudible] just starting as young as twelve and thirteen now, so ...
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  And it's --
L:  But you know, a lot of the kids still see each other and they still think it's cool to have that cigarette.
R:  There you go, that's it, you know.
L:  You know?
R:  I mean --
L:  God.
R:  It's like, yeah, 'cause, I mean, I live right on a corner from two high schools.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- there waiting on the bus stop these kids, you know, twelve and thirteen and they're lighting up first thing in the morning, like, seven thirty in the morning, I'm like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- okay, uh --
L:  I know.
R:  "Why do you need to be lighting up for in the first place?"  Hm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't get that.
L:  Yeah, let alone that time of the day.  I know --
R:  Yeah, I mean, you haven't had a stressful day yet, I can see me, if you work -- see, I'm a vice president of a telecom company, I need to be smoking about ten packs a day!  [LAUGH]
L:  E- exactly.  Exactly.
R:  After the stress I'm having, you're going to school, that's not stressful!  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  That's a joke compared to what my day's usually like --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know?  So --
L:  Yeah, but they don't know that, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They can't wait to get out of school and get out in the real world.  [LAUGH]
R:  I gotta -- I gotta -- yeah, right.
L:  If only they knew!  [LAUGH]
R:  I gotta -- I gotta go light up when I get home.  Oh yeah, right!  You pay bills?  Do you have children?  And it really goes downhill from then on in.
L:  That's right, that's right.  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Definitely.  And I'm like, "Okay, now --"  And it's just real interesting 'cause, I mean, these kids here, I mean, they're -- they're -- they're [NOISE] pre teens and they're like, hey, they're -- they're smoking and drinking, they're cussing and tearing cars up down here.  I mean -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- there was a kid just the other day, he got a brand new car for graduation.  Totalled his car.
L:  Huh!  [SIGH] [SIGH]
R:  Totalled his car.  I mean, he only had it about two days.
L:  Oh God.
R:  They were drag racing.  He was doing a hundred --
L:  Drag.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and five miles an hour, and he hit a tree.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh my God, was he killed?
R:  Instantly.
L:  Oh!
R:  Yes.  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh.
R:  And, uh, and this -- where the street is at, it's near a big shopping mall and there's a, you know, a kind of a dark area there so the kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, ni- on the weekends and the summer time, they drag race.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And unfortunately, uh, you know, he didn't make it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ....  And the cops were like, "Well, we're trying to crack down" and I'm like, "You can't crack down on 'em because the kids are gonna go somewhere else and do it, so ..."
L:  They'll just find someplace else, I know.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- and it's bad.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, it's like, okay, once you can get to bad, you know, and you're like, "Oh, it can't get any worse than that" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then, it just like -- did you hear about today, that, uh, Yale University, the mail room blew it today or something, or ...?
L:  No!
R:  Yeah.  I just read -- I was watching and listening in on TNN, I'm like, "It what?" [NOISE].
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  Yale University's mailroom had a [MN] big explosion there.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  I'm like, okay.  Just after we go back to, you know, sk- be alert high, it's like, this happens.  [NOISE]  I'm like, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  What's going on?
R:  This can't be going on again.
L:  Oh.
R:  This can't be happening.  This is not a good sign.
L:  No.
R:  So --
L:  No, it's definitely not.
R:  So how's the weather up there?
L:  Uh, we've had two days of beautiful sunshine, and now today it's all rainy again.
R:  Oh, okay.  We're having --
L:  yeah.
R:  -- that torrential rains, possible floods, and possible tornadoes, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for the rest -- 'til tomorrow.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Jeez, well --
R:  [several inaudible words] day, there you go!
L:  Yeah!  Yeah.  W- --
R:  You know, last year we had the same thing.  It's like, okay, it can't get any worse than that, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's been raining all day yesterday, all day today, and all day tomorrow.
L:  Uh!  Yeah --
R:  So, it's like --
L:  -- ours is supposed to be through the weekend as well, so, you know, it's --
R:  Oh yeah, and I'm like, okay.
L:  Yeah.  A h- -- another holiday weekend, uh, washed away.
R:  Another wash -- yeah, that's it, definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, do you have a big -- do you have any big smoking bans up in ma- -- uh, the major restaurants up there?
L:  We do.
R:  Okay.
L:  We do actually.  Um, uh, actually, Delaware, which is very close to us --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're like two and a half miles from the Delaware state line, and --
R:  Oh wow, okay.
L:  -- Um, Delaware restaurants are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- absolutely, totally smoke free.
R:  Wow.  Okay.
L:  Now, Pennsylvania, they are allowed to have non smoking areas --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the restaurants.
R:  Oh yeah, okay.
L:  But, it's -- it's up -- uh, uh, you know, it's a legislation at this point.
R:  Right.
L:  They really wanna make every -- all the public places smoke free.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, especially restaurants and theaters, and things like that.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  You know.  And --
R:  There was a major restaurant here that has been a big smokers' haven for almost a hundred years, they have a very small smoking section and, uh, they have cigar smoking.
L:  Oh.
R:  So the cigar smoking guys had a real big fit and about thirty people got into [several inaudible words] and -- and just lit up there.
L:  Oh!
R:  You know?  This is like a, you know, a hundred dollar a plate restaurant.  "I'm eating --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a hundred dollar plate there, excuse me, I got to be able to taste my food!  Huh.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  I'm not gonna have you, you know, I know you got a pulse, but go outside".
L:  Y- yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know?  And --
L:  Which really cracks me up too, you know like, when you drive by --
R:  Right.
L:  Like, places where people work, not necessarily restaurants, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- y- you -- i- it just cracks me up, it doesn't matter if it's frigid out there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's all these people standing outside smoking.
R:  [NOISE]  They're choking their lungs away.
L:  Oh my God!
R:  It don't make a difference if it's eighty degrees or minus twenty degrees, they gotta get that in -- they gotta get that nicotine fix.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And I know it's an addiction --
R:  Oh yeah, it is.
L:  -- because, you know, I -- I watched my husband quit.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, I've never smoked, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I --
R:  You're not missing anything.
L:  Uh, no, no.
R:  Huh.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  What's it now?  Three bucks a pack, I --
L:  Uh, I know!
R:  -- think I'd quit too.
L:  I know, that's another thing, how can these kids afford to smoke?
R:  [NOISE]  They take an allowance.
L:  I -- it's -- it's pathetic.
R:  Three bucks a pack --
L:  It's absolutely pathetic.
R:  -- and I was like, "Jesus Christ, at three bucks a pack, I ain't smoking a thing!"  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, and you know, I used to work in a grocery store, um, over the summer, I cashiered --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause we went to -- we went to Florida for the summer and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, just, you know, we camped and we worked in a grocery store, my husband and I, cashiering.
R:  Right.
L:  And these old people, who look like they don't have two nickels to rub together --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- come in and they buy two cartons of cigarettes a week, one for him and one for her.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm thinking, "What are they giving up, to buy these cigarettes?"
R:  Right.
L:  Because they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- obviously cannot afford them.
R:  Sure.
L:  You know?  And --
R:  Oh my God.
L:  -- and -- it's just a sin that they're addicted like this and --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And you know, a lot of their -- their mental thoughts are, "Well, you gotta die of something".
R:  Yeah.  Oh, gee --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's okay.  Uh, lung cancer, that's a good way to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't have to work in a coal mine to get that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, like I said --
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  -- I saw my father die, but I mean, he smoked, he was [inaudible], I'm almost forty, he'd smoked when he was like, in his teens.  He was like, "Ah, no big deal!"
L:  Yeah.
R:  And see, back in his day, you know, our parents' day, nicotine had no filters on.  He used to smoke the Camel killers with no filter.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So I was like, "Jesus Christ, you're getting straight nicotine tar --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- pesticide, gee, what --"
L:  All that stuff is just going right in your lungs.
R:  You know?
L:  I know.
R:  And it was just really sad, 'cause I mean, when he had his c- -- you know, his cancer treatments there, I think the cancer treatments, the -- just the radical cancer +treatment was smoking alone was like, okay, I would just, you know, oh, that's enough, I gotta quit, you know?  And he --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  He was like, "Okay, well, I guess I'll stop now", you know, gee, I mean, they had to take sixty percent of both his lungs out, so ...
L:  Oh wow.  Hm.
R:  That wasn't the way, you know, much that -- there isn't much a -- much of a comeback after that, unfortunately --
L:  No, no.
R:  -- you know?  He lasted about two and a half years, but, I mean, it was an agonizing two and a half years for him.  I mean --
L:  Not good quality.  Mm.
R:  The last six months of life he was like, "You know what?  I know I used to smoke, but you know, if I had my choice, I would not have".
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  And I'm like, okay.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, it's interesting, because, uh, my wife's father, he did the same thing, he smoked just about as much.  He smoke and drank, so he got, you know, cancer of the lungs and cancer of the liver, so --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- he went -- he went out both ways, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And he used to like -- he used to like -- he used to laugh and say, "Well, if I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna go one or the other, so ..."
L:  Oh gosh.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Unfortunately, he went out both at the same time, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And it's gut instinct, 'cause it's like, my son, he's almost two years old, and he's like, "Yeah, what was grandad like?"  Well, he was a hoot!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Lotta fun --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh, yeah.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The -- the smoking thing wasn't cute, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean -- I mean, he used to do like, fi- two to three packs a day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm like, excuse me, that's twenty five a -- in a pack and he'd do three, couple of packs a day.  Okay, "When do you breathe?"
L:  Yeah, right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  "When do you breathe?"  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess I see these kids out here, and I mean, they're going, "Yeah, I gotta get a [several inaudible words]".  "No, no, Marlboros, go cowboy killers, okay".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Three bucks a pack.  Uh, out here in Georgia --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they just want to jack the price up again another fifty cent tax to add on top of that --
L:  Good!
R:  -- so you're looking at almost four -- yeah, almost five bucks a pack.  I'm like, "Yeah, there goes your allowance now, kids!"  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Maybe that'll discourage them, hm, God.
R:  You know, when we were kids we used to spend our money or allowance on [inaudible] bubble gum, now they're like, "I gotta get me a pack of smokes, man".
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Uh, no.
L:  I know.  I -- I do- -- I don't get it.  I mean, these kids are so educated.  They're --
R:  Right.
L:  There's so much information --
R:  You're right.
L:  -- out there, and, you know --
R:  And it's interesting 'cause --
L:  -- they hear it
