L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  I -- I -- I barely understand what's happening.
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah, I can hear you. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  But I barely understand what is the -- what is the, uh --
L:  Oh, the topic?
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, um, I think what it is is, um, they're trying to pe- stop people from smoking in public places.
R:  Oh, oh, oh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] So, they wanna know how we feel about that.  If we think it's a good idea or not.
R:  Oh, I don't know, it -- it [NOISE] -- it's just about a lot of people have difference, uh, you know, understanding about it but the only thing, uh, I don't know what you think -- what do you think?
L:  I think, um, I think smoking is an unhealthy habit but I think that people have a right to -- to do it if the want to.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I -- I think that's probably the major, uh -- the major issue is the health problem but, I think, it is import- -- it is possible to stop in the public, yeah.  To -- to my understanding, yes, because it -- it might be -- involve some other people that they're allergic on the -- on the smoking [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think that you're right, I agree.  Do you think that the ads that they've put up -- do you think that that helps people to stop smoking?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like the -- on TV and stuff, do you think it helps people to stop smoking if they see, or helps kids not to start smoking, if they see the ads?
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  That's probably -- uh, but the thing is I don't know is it could be a miracle if they can, uh, stop for -- for any [inaudible] or somebody.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  And, you know, because I was all over the world, they've been smoking [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and for a long time too it's a very long tradition, in all cultures it seems that they're -- yeah.
R:  Uh, excuse me?
L:  Oh, I said in all cultures it seems that they have some sort of smoking, you know.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Almost everywhere you can go some people smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you know, they always have a place for them to go smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even though in that place people can walk by and just, you know -- they can [inaudible] that smoking coming around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even -- even in- indoors, in -- in house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You always have some problems.  In school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, public area like cafe- cafeteria -- I mean, uh, restaurant. [NOISE]
L:  Oh yeah, that's a common one.  How you separate where you're gonna sit and stuff on that, that's interesting I think that we chose where we sit wh- on that issue.
R:  I don't know, uh, what state are you from?
L:  I'm from Utah.
R:  Oh, you from Utah, yeah?
L:  Well, I grew up in Chicago and then I'm going to school here.
R:  Oh.  Yes, I'm from California.
L:  Oh.
R:  Down in, uh, Newport. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, beautiful.
R:  It is beautiful over here.
L:  Oh, I'm jealous. [LAUGH]
R:  It's hot, the -- the summer coming so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, but the smoking -- mostly California what I was talking about, uh, where you come from is -- is a state of California is almost, uh, a ban a lot of public areas.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yes, but I don't know about Utah it may be the same thing in Utah.
L:  Yeah and in the airport they have little, uh, rooms where people can go to smoke.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that's the only --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they have to be like designated places other than outside.
R:  Yeah.  But it -- it doesn't [NOISE] bother me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But to me I care for other people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some other people they have, uh, difference, uh, involvement with it but the most concern that I do have is just involving people that are allergic of the smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and -- and that's very bad.  So ...
L:  Are -- are you a smoker?
R:  Sometimes I used to smoke, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to smoke a lot but I -- I -- I cut it off and I quit for about almost ten years now.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a long time.
R:  It just -- it's just not use for me it -- well, sometimes I do a lot of exercise and do a lot of things [NOISE] it -- it just not worth -- wor- it's not worth for the body [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, the risk.
R:  It's no use for the body.  I don't know what ab- -- but the thing is really, uh, uh, comes to people it's addicting.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, those are the things but --
L:  And I don't think they should make any laws like outlawing it, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause I think that people should have that choice.
R:  It -- it just a people's choice.  They -- they feel like to smoke, they smoke and then the people when they feel like to stop, some people they have uh, uh, s- uh, a weak power -- willpower --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- I think 'cause that's mostly what it is.  Re- regardless of what the nicotine comes from --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and -- and how they feel -- treat and some of those kind of -- they have a lot of stuff about, uh, stopping that smoking.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But I don't know it help -- it's helped them for long run for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  And it depends on how long they've smoked too but, I think, it -- it's harder if you've smoked a long time.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] So, I believe it's a good -- it's a good law for -- for all the states, you know, and -- and I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and most of the other areas which still have the freedoms for the people, they can smoke, they can still chose where they can go to smoke, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think that's important, yeah.
R:  See we are not stopping them from smoke but publicly with a lot of people in there and, you know, sometimes in business area, they smoke in the car, all over the place, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Those kind of thing that just should stop [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], I agree.
R:  Yeah, because some of those big business are always giving out the car and they start [inaudible] the car and it's just talking about their -- their business.
L:  I --
R:  And by the time they finish you see the smoke all over the place so some are hit but they don't smoke, they just breathe that whole thing up so ...
L:  And, I think, with children too if they're maybe -- if they're not exposed to it in a public area maybe they might be less likely to smoke later on.
R:  Yes.
L:  If they're not used to it, you know, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I'm not [inaudible] toy train.  Yeah, excuse me.
L:  Oh, that -- is that your son?
R:  Yeah, that's my little boy. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, he sounds very cute.
R:  Yeah, yeah, this -- they, uh, they have to stay away from the smoke [LAUGH].
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, it -- I --
R:  -- so, those kind of thing is it's -- it's so bad for me when I look at the kids who start going to the high school, standing on the corner and puffing and huffing [LAUGH] you just say, "Oh, my gosh". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and it -- and it seems -- the kids that I went to high school with that smoked --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they had like a smoking corner and they would go -- and it seemed like all their attention was focused on when they could go get smoking next.
R:  It -- it -- it some of the problem with the [NOISE] school -- I don't wanna hear that [NOISE] -- with the school and the kid they just do it just for [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, to look good.
R:  I- it just -- just do it for, uh, uh, showing that he's -- so it's this other kid's intention and -- and -- and there are -- and -- and later on they got hook up on the nicotine and it just, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- becomes to be a -- to be a user.
L:  Do you think those TV -- what they have on TV, do you think that helps them to not smoke, to choose not to or do you think it just ...?
R:  About what -- what about the TV?
L:  You know how they have like those ads -- I don't know, in Utah they have -- like they show commercials like, "It's cool to not smoke" and stuff like that, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- showing kids.  Do you think that that does any good or no?
R:  [NOISE] What -- are you talking about advertising stop smoking or ...?
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.
R:  Yes, I think some -- some -- and some are not because [NOISE] even though the TV when they still look in at some of the movies [NOISE], you know, a while back like, you know, western movies and some of the movies kids adopted [NOISE] looking up, and some of the other movies they have the tendency to look at those people that are -- you know, some big -- big heroes [NOISE], you know.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And they're puffing and huffing and they wanna be like that [NOISE] and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, oh yeah, that's the kids, they are.
R:  See that -- those other things th- the kids just draw their attentions and becomes to be like their heroes.
L:  I had -- yeah.
R:  So, they're heroes and smoke cigarettes so I have to get a cigarette then, you know, uh, those kinda things.  Some of those are, uh, uh, uh, movies they get attentions of this young generations.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  They [inaudible] into it.
L:  That's a good point, I hadn't thought of that.  You're right, like other kinds of advertising that we don't think about, like that.
R:  [NOISE] So, it just -- the cigarette itself is -- look like -- they don't need no advertising, they're advertising it in the movies because the people are just like users, they're talking and puffing the cigarettes right along with what they were being doing in the movies, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh, regardless whatever -- uh, what kind of program we put up on TV to stop them they don't -- they don't stop them for if they really want to get what they want.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  I think maybe their -- their friends are a bigger influence than --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- than, yeah, the TV.
R:  Yeah, but on my ...
