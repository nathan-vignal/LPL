L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name is Laura.
L:  My name is Anne.  What --
R:  M- --
L:  -- part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm in Rhode Island. [LIPSMACK] What about you?
L:  Rhode Island?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I think our topic is, uh, terrorism --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and how would we respond in an attack.  Is that what you understood?
R:  It is, yes.
L:  Uh, well, do you -- if you have some thoughts, why don't you go first?
R:  Okay, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] well, judging from what happened September eleventh, I -- I don't think that I would, um, [LIPSMACK] be in a panic, but I think I would definitely be really concerned, um, for my family and, um -- I -- I don't know what your experiences were on September eleventh but, um, I didn't -- I wasn't affected personally by anyone, you know, in the World Trade Center that I knew but, [SIGH] um, you know, just watching the images on TV and things I was so glad for our family [LAUGH] to be back together at the end of the day after, um, after that hap- --
L:  Do you have small children?
R:  I do.  I have a, um, a four year old and a ten month old.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um -- we were actually at the park that day and I remember someone -- you know, someone said something about an airplane and I wasn't, you know, I wasn't really watching. [LAUGH] Everyone was at home watching the news.  I didn't know what was happening.  I got home and all of a sudden I have, you know, my mom calling me, "Turn on the TV" and, you know, um, it was -- it was kind of scary even though I didn't -- I wasn't affected personally, um ...
L:  Well, I think it was something --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- very, uh, unique --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for our country because we had never been attacked quite on -- of this --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in this magnitude.
R:  Right, huge. [LAUGH]
L:  We've been attacked before but, uh, it was such a heartrending experience --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, as far [SIGH] -- I'm not sure the -- the Government is handling terrorism in -- in the right way because I'm not sure that it can be, um, halted by the traditional methods --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of -- of halting enemies, because the enemy is -- is not so easily identifiable.
R:  Right.  I have no idea how they can even, you know, distinguish the threats and try to figure out --
L:  Um --
R:  -- what's real or not or anything.
L:  I'm not sure what their philosophy is and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I suppose all terrorists don't have the same ideas --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it seems like they're almost on a -- a suicide mission --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and sometimes they say it's religious but I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't -- I don't understand what kind of god could condone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- this type of behavior so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I d- -- I don't understand the religious aspect --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um -- as far as I -- whether or not I would panic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I'm -- I'm sixty six years old --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're much younger --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I think a lot of it would depend on your age group and how many people were dependent upon you.
R:  Right.  Definitely.
L:  Uh, in y- -- if I was in your category I suppose I would panic because --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- your first thought is to protect your family.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] my family's all grown --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm in the -- probably the latter stages of my life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I don't think I would panic --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because at the age I am, you always wonder how you're going to die but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, that certainly would be -- not be my first choice. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  But I -- I would probably be a little bit more philosophical about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the same I would with a tornado warning or anything else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I would think, "Well, is this it?  Is my time up?"
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, the -- just the magnitude of how many people would be affected --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is -- is very, very frightening.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I d- -- I don't have any answers as to how we can fight it because I don't -- we can't gather these people together anywhere [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and --
R:  Well, there's --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- you know, there's --
L:  -- and ask are they terrorists. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] There's always going to be people out there that, you know -- and obviously their [SIGH] their view of life is so different than ours.  To be able to be capable of doing something like that, I just don't --
L:  Yeah, you have to think about those --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, two guys that stayed over here, I believe --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for two years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's what's so mind boggling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And for two years they knew their mission.  It's not like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they just suddenly --
R:  They were preparing.
L:  -- decide [LAUGH] to -- to give --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it up for the -- for the terrorist cause.
R:  Right.
L:  They had two years to think about it and mingle with the American people who were basically --
R:  Right.
L:  -- freedom loving.
R:  That's true.
L:  And from what I heard they --
R:  And to enjoy our way of life that's so different than theirs, I'm sure, you know.
L:  Well, they -- they went to bars --
R:  [inaudible] freedom.
L:  -- and they chitchatted with people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you have to wonder, was that just -- did they start thinking, you know, maybe this is [LAUGH] not the right path? [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  But, um, I really -- it's just -- just, um, the whole topic is so mind boggling and I -- I -- I think the war that we're in now [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had to be but I'm not so sure we can start battling it everywhere.
R:  Mhm.  That's true.  I don't think just, uh, we can by ourselves, you know, [LAUGH] end all of the -- all of the problems.  I don't know.  Mm.
L:  Well ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess that's about my only views that -- uh, I don't know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- if our time is all up, I haven't been watching the clock.
R:  Yeah, I haven't either.
L:  I think they're going to let us know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh --
R:  Where are you in the country?
L:  I'm in Memphis, Tennessee.
R:  Okay.  You m- --
L:  You can probably tell I have a southern accent.
R:  Oh, I can but I love it.  My -- my parents are North Carolina so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] So you're used to the accent.
R:  It just sounds like home.  It's just nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] Were your [COUGH] were your parents very worried about the -- as worried as you were about the terrorist attack?
R:  Um, I -- I just remember that day -- whenever I got home my mom was calling me. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, to check on me.  Actually, it's kind of strange, um, my husband at the time, um, had quite a few friends that worked in the Boston World Trade Center and whenever I first heard people talking about the World Trade Center I -- my first assumption was that it was in Boston, actually.
L:  Mm.
R:  Which is a much smaller [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that was just my first thought, and I immediately started thinking of all the people I know that worked there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we're friends with so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, i- it didn't affect us but, you know it's very --
L:  I'm not sure, do you think the idea was just to scare us --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- o- or do you think the idea was to kill as many people as possible?  I've w- wondered about that.
R:  I don't -- I -- I don't know.  I'm wondering maybe if it was just to [SIGH] to show that we were vulne- +vulnerable to the rest of the world and [MN] um ... [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  I don't think it could have been personal because --
R:  Right, they don't --
L:  -- they would not really have any way of knowing that some of their own people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- would not -- uh, but -- but if you have the idea that you want to die for the cause, I guess they figured if [LAUGH] anybody happened to be in that building --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it was a terrorist they would --
R:  Right.
L:  -- go along with it.  It's just, um --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- very -- extremely hard to understand their --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- their mental state of mind.
R:  Right.
L:  I wish I could get inside their mind and understand what it is they want --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I -- I don't think they've made any demands as such.
R:  [SIGH] I don't know.  No, I don't -- I don't get the chance to keep up with the new- -- [LAUGH] with the news too often but [MN] they did arrest one person that was, um, involved in the planning of it, didn't they?  I wonder if he has --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- you know, spoken much on, [SIGH] you know, why he was doing it and why he'd agreed to.  I don't know.
L:  I'm sure he's gonna lie.
R:  Right, that's true.
L:  But, um, it --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- it -- it would be nice if they would come forth with some agenda as to exactly what it is they want.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I don't -- I don't know of anybody personally that's done anything to them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, so it's just hard to figure.  Uh, it seems like our ten minutes should be up, shouldn't it?
R:  I would -- I would think so [several inaudible words].
L:  But they were supposed to cut in, I think.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  I have.  Is this your first time?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, this --
L:  First time and I wasn't sure what to expect or ...
R:  Yeah, this is my third call.  My mom told me about this so I [LAUGH] signed up for it.
L:  I didn't quite understand I got it on the Internet if this is --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- an ongoing thing or three calls is our maximum.
R:  What I understood was that it's three calls and then they may call back other people to continue p- -- to participate.
L:  I see.  I guess certain ones are selected.
R:  Right, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- I wish that we could come up with some plan --
R:  [NOISE] [COUGH]
L:  -- for either understanding or eliminating terrorism --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I think it has so many different faces --
R:  Right.  So many --
L:  -- that, um, it's just -- i- it's not like any other enemy we've encountered before.
R:  Mhm, [inaudible] I agree.
L:  And then I'm not even so sure if Saddam Hussein --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was a terrorist in -- in the traditional sense.
R:  Right.
L:  He was a tyrant --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, I'm -- I'm not so sure that -- I -- I -- I guess the war was necessary --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to show him we meant business.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I think we're going to have to do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more here on the home front --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to eliminate the possible --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- terrorists, and I don't think they did enough the last time.
R:  Right.  It's amazing to me -- have you flown since, um, September eleven [several inaudible words]?
L:  No, I haven't but I've never been afraid of flying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  M- -- all my friends laugh at me because --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I prefer flying to being in an automobile.
R:  Right.
L:  If I'm going across the country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I can be across there in several hours and it's all over with and if something happens I die.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  But if I'm in a car and I drive that far --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I fear getting all mangled up in a crash.
R:  Right, or a --
L:  So, uh, eh, I mean, I'm sure if I had flown right around that time it would have been on my mind.
R:  Mhm.  My mother actually came up.  She had, um, planned a visit, you know, to visit the grandchildren, [LAUGH] uh, about, let's see, I believe it was two weeks after --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the attack and I said, "Are you scared to come?" and she said, "No, I'm coming to see [LAUGH] my grandkids, I'm not going to let that stop me".  But she flew, you know, right after --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it happened, and I've flown since then.  Yeah, their security is definitely increased but it's -- it's strange to look back at how --
L:  I'm not sure that --
R:  -- easy it would have been.
L:  I'm not sure there's any type of security that's going to work but I guess --
R:  Right, that's true, that's true.  They're always going to come up with a new method probably and a new way --
L:  Mhm.  I live just a couple of miles from the Memphis airport --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I suppose I would be in what's called a prime target.
R:  Right.
L:  But -- I -- I just don't spend a lot of every day t- -- I have everyday --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bills and pr- --
