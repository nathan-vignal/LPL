R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Judy.
L:  I'm Sheila.
R:  Hi.  Um, I -- I wasn't quite sure, she said that the topic was smoking?
L:  Yes, uh-huh.  A- --
R:  And we're supposed to talk for ten minutes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- about smoking.  How we feel about it, or ...?
L:  Um, uh, banning it in -- in public places I think is it.
R:  Yes, I thoroughly agree with that.  I don't -- I'm not a smoker.  And, would you believe, I live in a smoking town.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, where tobacco is king.  [SIGH] But it's very irritating to me and I think it should be banned in public places.  How do y- --
L:  I totally agree.  I'm a nonsmoker.
R:  You are?
L:  Middle aged, nonsmoker, always have been.  Um --
R:  Uh-huh, I've never smoked either.
L:  It makes me really sick.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It gives me headaches.  There's nothing worse than going out to dinner and having to deal with that --
R:  I know.
L:  -- while you're trying to have a good meal.
R:  I tell you what bothers me too is these, uh, hospitals.  They have it -- banned smoking in the building, and the smokers stand out in front of the doors and smoke.  A- --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and -- and you've got to walk through it to get into the building.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think if they're going to ban it they ought to make 'em go to the back of the building where the public doesn't have access to it.
L:  Designated areas.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I totally agree with all the airlines and all -- you know, I'm thankful for that, that they've come that far.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, me too.  Of course, I haven't been on an airplane in a long time.  [SIGH] But, um ... [LIPSMACK] and I forgot the other question she asked.  I'm a senior citizen and, uh --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I think just the public awareness, um --
R:  Uh-huh.  H- how to stop it.
L:  -- maybe of the medical issues.
R:  Well, now, I think if somebody wants to smoke that's their own business.
L:  Right.
R:  Y- you know.  I -- I mean, good gracious, the town I live in, we [LAUGH] -- the -- i- if -- if it wasn't for tobacco we wouldn't exist, probably.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] the, uh, you know, a- -- I think everybody has the right to smoke if they want to, but -- but those of us who don't, then I think we ought to be, uh, uh -- they ought to fix it so that we wouldn't have to smell it.
L:  Right.  I totally agree.  It gets in your clothes, gets in your hair.  And for a nonsmoker they don't realize how sensitive, I think, th- -- um, it is to nonsmokers.
R:  I know.
L:  I mean, you smell it so easily --
R:  You're right.
L:  -- if you're a nonsmoker, on your clothes and in your hair and ... um y- you don't have to be around it for very long.
R:  No, you don't.  Well, I -- we bought a house three years ago and the people who lived in it before us smoked.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we had no time to repaint or do anything and I like to died, uh, the first few -- few weeks till we got our -- that odor out of here.  You know, because we had to move in a hurry because the people that wanted our house were in a flood and they wanted to move in.
L:  Right.
R:  So they wanted to, you know, wanted to -- in our house and we had to get out quickly.
L:  So you could tell that it -- they definitely smoked in the house?
R:  Yeah -- oh, mercy, yes.
L:  And that's a big issue for me.  I don't know how you feel about it, but i- if company comes over, I think it's very rude to light up a cigarette in a home where you see no ashtrays sitting around.
R:  Well, [LAUGH] --
L:  I mean, it's pretty obvious that the people living there don't smoke.
R:  Yeah.  Well, all of my friends know that we don't smoke, and, uh --
L:  The least they could do would be to step outside. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Now, my sister -- my inlaws that come that smoke, they do, they go outside 'cause they know we don't like it.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, [SIGH] and I think that [SIGH] they should s- -- you know, not sell it to teenagers and, uh, [MN] keep the a- ads going to, uh, keep it off of TV and everything.  But, you know, [LAUGH] I have a real problem with alcohol --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] advertise that on everything, but -- I don't know, it's just one of those things that will never be, uh, really solved, I don't think, 'cause there's too many people who -- who do smoke.  But I think they're cutting down on it.
L:  Yeah, and -- and I work in the medical field and I think public awareness of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of a lot of this is important.
R:  You do?  You work in the medical field?
L:  I do.  Yeah, I'm a, um --
R:  Yeah.  I'm retired.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I reti- --
L:  Sometimes my body feels retired. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I retired, um ... let's see --
L:  I- --
R:  -- almost ten years ago, and where I worked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they did smoke and -- till they build a new building and then they stopped.
L:  Right.
R:  But I worked in it for thir- -- twenty nine and a h- half years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- where they were allowed to smoke.  In fact, I got up a petition for 'em not to smoke and they voted in the smokers' -- you know, some people didn't care either way.
L:  Right.
R:  And it made it bad on us who -- who did want it stopped, but they -- he did stop it when the buil- -- the new building -- 'cause he didn't want his new building smoked up. [LIPSMACK] Bu- -- and he had a designated area out back where you didn't have to walk through it to get in the building. [SIGH]
L:  Right, that's good.  So, I know exactly what you mean by hospitals.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, the employees there have a designated area but the public can stand outside the back door and --
R:  Yeah, the front door. [LAUGH]
L:  Or in the front door, right.
R:  Well now, I'm talking about nurses at Duke university where [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I go sometimes, they're -- the -- the nurses are standing -- staff are standing out there in the front where the --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- patients have got to go through it to get in there.
L:  Well, I'm from a smaller town so they can pretty much ... they can get you for that 'cause everybody knows everybody [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, you would -- you know, uh ... Duke, uh, is up there in Durham, North Carolina, and that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, tobacco country too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We live in tobacco land, I mean, you know, so it's -- it's hard -- it's hard even in our town here to get, uh, laws passed to keep 'em out of certain places, you know.
L:  Do you know how y- -- how your high schools are there about, um, having designated smoking areas?  I know you have to be eighteen to smoke but I'm pretty sure that our high school has that.
R:  I think that, uh, they -- I don't know.  My children graduated years ago and, uh, they never -- I never ask 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, they never smoked, that I know of.  But I heard on the news last night, on one of the local stations, uh, that they were going to, uh, ban it even in the parking lots [LIPSMACK] in the schools.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I would think that that's how it would be.  You know, 'cause you know if an eighteen year old can get 'em, they're going to give 'em to their younger --
L:  Younger friends.
R:  -- friends.
L:  Sure.
R:  'Cause, you know, that's just -- that's just life.  And there's no way of stopping that.  And a parent can give a child a cigarette too, I think, if he wants to.  Uh ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  I don't know the law on that.
R:  I don't know whethe- --
L:  If it's like with alcohol or if it's ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... I guess not enforced as much.
R:  Right, I don't know either.
L:  But you're right, and -- and if they did away with it in the high school systems and didn't have that, if a kid can go all day without smoking a cigarette --
R:  He could go, you know -- well, they think it's cool.
L:  Then they can -- they can certainly go [LAUGH] without it, period.
R:  Mhm.  Now, my son's inlaws, they all smoke.  And, uh, I noticed the other day, well, my grandson is three now, but when he was -- he wasn't even two, he picked up a straw and said he was smoking, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- so, uh [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  Because that's what he sees.
R:  That's what he sees from --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from my son's inlaws.  They don't smoke -- my son and daughter in law don't smoke, but her -- her par- -- her folks do.  And little kids are going to pick up those [SIGH] bad habits, and of course ...  My mom always smoked and my daddy hated it.  But, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Do you think that females do it for weight control?
R:  I don't know.  I really don't know.
L:  I -- I've thought about that because a lot of the people that I work with, they'll smoke instead of eating.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well --
L:  And they say that it really curbs their appetite and that's their excuse.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I've heard that too.  That's, uh ... I gue- --
L:  But I guess if you have such a nasty taste in your mouth afterwards, you sure -- probably don't want anything to eat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, people who smoke, that's the first thing they want to do after they get through eating.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Have you ever noticed that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  In restaurants and places --
L:  And they want to sit there and chitchat and light up while you try to eat.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And the no smoking areas are -- you know, they do back into the smoking areas, you know.  I try to get as far away from them as I can but, um, you can't always do that.  But --
L:  I'm sure in some of the smaller places ...
R:  You --
L:  ... you know, like I say, I'm from a small area, the restaurants are so small here that, uh, you can be on one side of the restaurant and -- and it can be nonsmoking, the other side can be smoking and it doesn't matter --
R:  Oh, right, what if you --
L:  -- because it's so small.
R:  -- you -- you know, if you go, like, to, uh, here where we live is sma- -- it's a small city.  But we have some pretty good restaurants.  But even they're not big, because, you know, they just -- they don't have the -- a -- well, to give you an example, we want to [LAUGH] have a convention here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and there's not a place big enough here for us to have a convention to have about two hundred people in it, you know -- a meeting room, so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] You -- the places are too small, I think.  But to stop it you're going to have to stop it, uh, you're going to have to have a city or [MN] a county ordinance to stop it here.  And I don't think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that'll ever happen.  Not in this town where tobacco is king.  In fact, we're known as the tobacco capital of the world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so --
L:  So it's kind of like, uh, being from there and saying, "No" is just like taking money out of your pocket.
R:  Right, well, it is. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Eh, and in a roundabout way all of us who earn a living here, um, [LIPSMACK] made it through tobacco, even though we did have some more industries who've moved in since, uh -- I've live here only --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- forty years.  When I first came here there was noth- --
