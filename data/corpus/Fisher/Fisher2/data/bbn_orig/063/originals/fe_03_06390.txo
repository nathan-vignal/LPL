R:  Hi, my name is Terri.
L:  Hi, my name is Nancy.
R:  Hi, Nancy.  Um, [SIGH] uh, m- my feeling about terrowi- terrorism, excuse me, is that because this country is so [SIGH] ... has been so isolated and, uh, w- we have no idea of what the rest of the world is going through with terrorism, that I truly think we would panic.  I don't know what you would ...
L:  I -- I would probably have to agree with you.  You know, we don't -- we don't really take into consideration on how, um, easy, you know, we do have it and how --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- and how fortunate we are.  Um, I know that I would be probably a little terrified. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I know, just watching, uh, the, uh, the aftermath of nine eleven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, and I -- I was, uh, you know, ninety miles away.  I was -- I was terrified, uh, and I couldn't breathe and I was [LAUGH] I was --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- feeling all of the --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- all of the -- the -- the, uh, emotions, uh, to a -- a -- a tenth of a degree or a hundredth or a hundredth of a degree --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that those people were experiencing.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, uh, you know, they just, uh, raised the terror alert for this weekend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to orange.
L:  Yes.
R:  And we were -- we happened to be at a, uh, [LIPSMACK] at a gathering and quite a few people said, "Oh, this is bogus".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah --
L:  I'm hoping. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I am too, definitely.
L:  You know, that's --
R:  But they're saying, "What are they even doing it" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I think I would just like to be a little more aware.
L:  Right, right, they -- they need to inform us on why they, you know, why they think that they're raising it, you know.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Just because of the weekend and there's going to be more traveling and, you know, I think that they should make us as citizens more aware --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- of what's going on.
R:  Well, I know that w -- -- the --
L:  They kind of leave us out in the cold. [LAUGH]
R:  The town that I'm living in -- I live in Maryland and we're having the biggest flag you know, the one that they had used at, I think, the Superbowl --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they're bringing -- it's going to the beach in -- in Ocean City.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And, uh, o- originally they were asking for volunteers to carry it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I wasn't sure whether we were going to be home or not so I didn't volunteer.  I thought we might be visiting my sons in Philadelphia.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'm very glad I didn't volunteer.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  And I know -- I know I'm a chicken but I -- I do not think that, um, I would handle well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would not -- I know I [LAUGH] I would freak out totally.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and I think most people would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really do.
L:  Yeah.  I, um, I live in Ohio so it's, you know, I'm not that far --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from you.  But, you know, still being as close to the coast as you are it's ... you know, right there it's prime area and, uh, you know, unfortunately a target --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, as being in that location.
R:  We are just ninety miles from Washington --
L:  Oh, my heavens.
R:  -- and, um, we are a hundred and thirty from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, you know, we're sort of [LAUGH] like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I just think that, you know, when you -- when you see people in Israel or -- or, um, Palestine and you see them as a matter of fact going on with their daily lives --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, I know after nine eleven ... I -- they said to return to normal and, um [LAUGH] --
L:  That's hard to --
R:  -- you try to but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you -- you couldn't.  You really couldn't.
L:  There -- there is not a normal any more.  You know, you're always looking out and being prepared and taking precautions and whatnot.
R:  Well, I have to tell you, my son just graduated from the University of Pennsylvania this weekend.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, well, congratulations.
R:  Well, thank you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And we were sitting in the stands on Sunday and there were -- I think they said there were, like, I don't know, three thousand graduates.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a plane -- I could hear a plane, I couldn't see a plane.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A- a- and --
L:  That makes you so --
R:  It -- it does.
L:  -- so paranoid. [LAUGH]
R:  But what was even more frightening, my husband and I, we must have had, uh, we must have had five cameras and videos and -- and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the digitals and stuff.  And all these people had these carry on bags going into, uh, where the graduation ceremony was going to be.  It was in the outdoor stadium.  They did not search bags.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And my husband is like, "Anybody, anybody" -- and of course the University of Pennsylvania has a very, very diverse --
L:  Right.
R:  Student enrollment, as most students -- or most colleges do, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- universities do, but I think even more so at --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at something like that.  And, I mean, anybody could have gotten in.
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, it was like, "Oh, my God", you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, what do you do now?  And, you know, you really wanna double check who you're sitting beside. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, exactly, exactly.
L:  Yeah --
R:  But I -- I just know that, um, I -- I think most people in America -- I know my kids couldn't do it, I mean, I ... uh, not that they're kids, they're -- they're young men --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, uh, I think they take it as a joke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- they really don't comprehend the full scope of what could happen --
L:  What's actually going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's what I'm -- you know, we just had a -- a baby, um, he's --
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  -- he's three months old.  Thank you.
R:  Oh, how wonderful.
L:  And, you know, you sit there and wonder, you know, "I'm bringing in a baby into this world and all of a sudden it's crashing down".
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, how is -- you know, what's it going to be like for him when he gets to be --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- you know, an adult and out on his own and, you know, what's -- you know.  Unfortunately.
R:  Unfortunately, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think every generation has gone through that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and said basically the same thing you just said.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I a- --
L:  We get through it, I suppose. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I -- I'm sure you do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at what expense?
L:  Right.
R:  I mean --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- uh, as I said, I know with nine eleven, uh, people -- I have -- at the time I lived in Philadelphia and I worked at a school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, a trade --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and technical school.  And people were going to the nurse, they were so hyper and every noise and every --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- c- -- backfire and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, uh, people --
L:  It's hard to live life --
R:  -- were in a panic.
L:  Yeah, it's hard to live life like that.
R:  A- and I just think that if anything, God forbid, should happen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people would not react well.
L:  Right, right.
R:  They -- they couldn't.
L:  No.
R:  They're -- they're not used to it.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  Unless they've come from another country that -- they may have --
L:  That it happens --
R:  -- been exposed to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  Unfortunately. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  I -- I just hope that, you know, nothing like that happens around here to us.  Um, un-, you know, unfortunately after nine eleven, um, we have to take more precautions and more --
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, be more cautious with everybody and everything, and wherever we go, um, you really have to watch your back --
R:  But how --
L:  -- unfortunately.
R:  [MN] Again, uh, how many people really are that cautious?
L:  Right, right.
R:  I mean, I know, uh, you know, it was funny when they were talking, uh -- I forget how many months ago when they were talking about the [inaudible] tape and the plastic sheeting and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh, over the windows.
R:  Well, I admit, I did -- I did not get that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I did not get that.
L:  No, I didn't either. [LAUGH]
R:  But I did -- I got water. [LAUGH] Okay, I did get water.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  But it was amazing.  I live in this old Victorian home and, you know, they said, "Find a safe room with no windows --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- if you can".  Well, I don't have one room without a window.
L:  I was going to say, "Good luck on that", 'cause I live in an old house, uh, old, um, historical house.
R:  Oh, how wonderful.
L:  And, uh, every room has four or five windows in it.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God.  See, uh, you were j- -- I -- my house has thirty seven windows.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And it's like --
L:  I think that's about how much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, there's -- there's four windows in each room.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So there's a lot.  And it's a two storey home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it's -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, the room I'm sitting in right now has eight windows.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  You know, and it's, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, uh, uh, I -- we have a little powder room which you could fit, like, a person in if --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you're really lucky [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but not for any length of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, [MN] I -- I do take the -- the terrorist alerts seriously, I really do.
L:  Yes.
R:  Because, uh, I think we have been so fortunate.
L:  Right.
R:  We have never had to experience anything that the rest of the world has.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And I think once, you know -- hopefully we don't have to go through it --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but I think once we go through it, more people would take into consideration, um, when they do come up with a terrorist alert and raise it, um, to be more cautious.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  And I think that's -- unfortunately is what it would have to take for most people to realize that, you know, this isn't really a game.  You know, they're not just talking any more.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Unfortunately. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I just think that, um, as I said, we are so insulated that we -- we can't comprehend --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what the rest of the world is going through.  Y- you -- you watch th- the TV and you watch the news channels and you go, "Oh yeah, isn't that terrible" --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but, uh, [MN] you know, I've never had to bury a son who was killed in a bomb, or I've never had to, uh, bury a father who was killed in a bomb or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, we j- -- we just don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- we go -- we go to the mall, we go shopping, we do something --
L:  We take so much for granted.
R:  A- -- exactly, yes.  Yes.
L:  And don't realize how well we do have it and how, you know, easy things are for us --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- when -- when we don't have to cope through what the rest of the nation and things that happen to them, um, they have to go through.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I know I wouldn't wanna live in Washington.  I do know that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's something I know [LAUGH] I wouldn't --
L:  I -- I would be --
