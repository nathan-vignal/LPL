L:  Yeah, I think that, um --
R:  Uh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- hello?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I didn't know that you were going to talk.  I thought I was supposed to talk when the beep went. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I just wanted to introduce myself.  My name is Ana[?], hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, Ana, how you doing?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  Good.  I'm Leigh[?].
R:  Nice to meet you.  I -- I take it we're supposed to talk about smoking now?
L:  Yes.
R:  All right.  Um --
L:  Are you somebody else that's doing this test, or we're just two people talking?
R:  Um, I'm also participating in the study.
L:  Or do you work for the University of Pennsylvania?
R:  A- --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- are -- are you participating in the study?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  I guess they just match us up, 'cause we both called in at the same time.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  My guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what are your thoughts on New York, smoking, whatnot? [LAUGH]
L:  See, I'm not a smoker.
R:  Ah.
L:  [NOISE] Are you -- you must be a smoker?
R:  Um, actually I wasn't chosen because I was a smoker, I do smoke, which is bad and wrong --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, uh, no, my thoughts on smoking don't necessarily reflect that of a smoker.  I think it's one of the stupidest things to do ever.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I think it's a good idea. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, I'm torn.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it certainly makes the atmosphere more pleasant for everyone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but on the other hand, I'm a little nervous that we're starting to just yank liberties and rights and independence, I'm -- I'm a little more towards the personal responsibility, and I absolutely don't mind there being, you know, smoking bars and non smoking bars.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the idea that you can't, even if you want to, in a private setting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have --
L:  True.
R:  I mean, what's gonna -- I mean, they're -- I feel like if you're allowed to have oxygen bars, you should be allowed to have, like, gross, disgusting cigar bars, which I will never go to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think you should be able to have them.
L:  And I think it should be up to -- y- you know, uh, me as a person that doesn't smoke, it should be my choice as to whether or not I wanna go to that bar where they are smoking, but for them to ban it, you might be right.   Just --
R:  Well --
L:  -- all over, hm. [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I'm saying, is I'm torn.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  Because, I mean, there obviously should be options for everyone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but to have just a one subset of people denied, you know, the -- to go out in public and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do whatever they want, I mean, there are lots of things that I think are stupid, but if people want to, you know, I -- I don't play video games, but if they wanna have huge conventions and have people come and pay and all play video games back to back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- good for them. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I think it rots your brain, so I won't go. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.
R:  Although, you know, I -- what do you think about having, you know, quitting help lines and the non smoking ads?
L:  Mm, I like the non smoking ads.
R:  How -- okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Repeat your question again? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry.  I -- I just thought that we'd kind of covered the ban in New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You've come down on mostly a good idea, a little undecided --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've come down on mostly undecided. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I am kind of undecided on -- on the smoking in New York but, you know, I come from a family, my Mom used to smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all the time, and I guess after a certain period of time, you know, my father didn't allow her to smoke in the house anymore --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so she had to smoke, you know, outside, but I just -- for me, like, even when I go to bars and stuff like that, I hate to sit -- I hate to leave the bar, 'cause, like, if I wear a leather coat or something like that, everything, my hair smells like cigarettes, my clothes smells like ci- cigarettes and I absolutely hate it.
R:  Yeah, well, I do, I hate going dancing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where you're allowed to smoke, because obviously if you're doing some sort of cardiovascular activity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's really not fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, again, and I would li- -- I would like to see more choice there, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in terms of anti smoking ads and stuff, I think it's hysterical that I -- i- isn't it true that Philip Morris and a couple of the other big tobacco companies have to help --
L:  Are the ones that are putting it out.
R:  -- sponsor it?
L:  [LAUGH] Absolutely.  It's -- it's -- it's like, "We know we're going to kill you, but --" [LAUGH] I think it's just, you know, C.Y.A., just something for them to cover themselves to say that at least we tr- -- we warned them --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- you know what I mean?
R:  -- I think part of it was the tobacco settlement.
L:  Yeah, that's what I mean.
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  Just to say that, you know, "We told them, so they can't come back ten years from now and if they get cancer or something like that, say that we weren't -- we didn't tell 'em".
R:  Yeah, well, I think it was really shady of them in, you know, years pr- -- past when they had information saying it was bad for you, to -- to actively lie about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But at this point, I don't think anyone complains that they think smoking is a good idea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think you can claim, "I'm going to do it anyway". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  "And I will pay the consequences --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- for what I do".
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Now, how long have you been smoking?
R:  Oh, me?  Um, again, it's kind of an on and off thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess I -- probably since I was eighteen.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, which is four years but, you know, with as many as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- three months off every now and again, so --
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, four years?  God, you're young. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, and it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's t- -- it's terrible for you and every time I quit for a little while I think, "Oh, maybe -- maybe I'll just never start again".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I'm always like, "Well, one won't hurt" and now it's, like, "Oh God.  I just have to just up and decide". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I'm under no illusion that the tobacco companies made me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I- it's totally my fault. [LAUGH]
L:  Now, did you start -- did you just get into it, I guess, like, from high school or something like that, or --
R:  I got into it because I wanted to be James Dean.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh God, you know what?  Everybody says that. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Because that is still one of the coolest, sexiest things to be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And as it turns out, you know, there are plenty of aspects of smoking that really don't fit with that cool image.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there is still something, it doesn't matter how many ads, you know, the one, like, where they have the girl look in the trash can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you run to make it look --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not cool, 'cause there'll still be that image of James Dean, leaning against A wall --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- in a leather jacket --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- looking cool. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess so.  I don't know, I -- I don't --
R:  That's why most people start --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think.  I mean, and, uh, well, some people, you know, different reasons but ... no --
L:  It just never appealed to me.
R:  Uh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It never appealed to me, and it could be because of watching my mother smoke all the time, and not liking the smell of it, but it just --
R:  Absolutely, well, I won't date smokers.
L:  You [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's weird.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Okay, that's almost as bad as the tobacco company [LAUGH] putting out don't smoke ads.
R:  I don't -- well, I mean, it's not something that if a guy picked up a cigarette, I'd run away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't -- I don't wanna make it easier for myself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And putting yourself in an environment, it's, like, you know, if -- if I'm serious about not quitting, I can't go out to bars --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where people are going to be lighting up all around me, because the only thing I'll wanna do is smoke. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and in -- in -- you know, it's -- i- -- a lot of it has to do with setting and, sort of, you know, that's how I choose to date people too, if -- you know, like I would never date someone who spent all their time at, like, concerts of music that I didn't like. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Because then it -- you know, it -- it's the atmosphere that you surround yourself with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We don't need extra cigarettes. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I guess not.
R:  No, but, um, no, in terms of the anti smoking ads, I actually think it's a good idea, and I think that if it works and you have a whole generation of kids growing up with the message pretty much being constantly thrown at them that smoking is not cool --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's gonna w- -- it's gonna work better propaganda wise than, say, James Dean movies. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you find that -- well, you're -- you're a lot younger than me, so I can ask you this question, do you find that a lot of, um, people your age, or within four years of your age don't smoke?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Plenty -- plenty of people don't smoke.  I -- I mean, amongst my friends or acquaintances or -- I -- I don't know exactly what you want to judge this by, but y- you know, it's -- I would split it down the middle, and a lot of people who do smoke are more social smokers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than actual smokers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and if they go out in the weekend, they might have a cigarette or something and -- I -- I don't know exactly how to count that. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I think out of [COUGH] ten of my closest friends, none of them smoke, neither socially nor --
R:  Good for them.
L:  Yeah, none of them smoke, but --
R:  Yeah, basically no- none of the athletes I know smoke.
L:  Yeah.  When I was growing up though, you know, when I was in grammar school, high school, everyone smoked, that was, like, the thing, you know, to do.  Like, none of my friends did it, but a lot of the people in my high school and stuff, they all smoked, but ... um --
R:  Well, good on you.
L:  Yeah, well, [LAUGH] not to say that I try anything. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just didn't like smoking, [LAUGH] that's all.
R:  No, no.  Well, it's -- it's one of those things that there really is no excuse to start.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] Well, I guess so.  I -- I g- -- I guess it's a bad thing.  I actually find those ads amusing.
R:  I find them amusing too and I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think they're doing a good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I think it's, um, I think it's kind of obnoxious when people have an attitude that smoking or not smoking makes you a better person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  But some people -- I mean, you have to d- -- you do have to think of it realistically, probably I would say half of the teenagers that start smoking don't start because, "Oh, I wanna smoke.  This taste good".  They do it because they see their friends doing it.
R:  That's --
L:  Because they think it makes them look cool.
R:  Y- yes. [LAUGH] There is certainly that.
L:  So I don't -- yeah, I don't think it -- i- it -- it definitely cannot be because that they taste good. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I -- actually, I beg to differ. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  There is something about the sensation that is in itself very pleasurable.
L:  Now, are you saying --
