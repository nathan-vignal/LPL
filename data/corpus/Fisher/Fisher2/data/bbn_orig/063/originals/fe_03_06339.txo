R:  Hello, this is Patricia.
L:  Hello, this is Debbie.  How are you, Patricia?
R:  Oh, this is my first time.
L:  This is my second --
R:  This is great.
L:  -- time. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well, I'm Patricia in [inaudible] and I think we're talking about smoking.
L:  Yes, and I'm in San Antonio, Texas.
R:  Oh, for heaven's sake.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you smoke?
L:  I am an ex smoker --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I have been quit now for two and a half years, but I think that people should have the choice.  I have a friend that lives in Anaheim, California, and they're trying to pass a law there that says that you cannot smoke in your car or anywhere in a public place, or around a public place.
R:  Like, not in your car even?
L:  Not even in your car.  She said they're trying to pass this law where they can actually stop you and give you a ticket if you smoke in your car.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I said, "Do you think that's really going to work?"  She said, "Well, they're trying it for cellphones and that hasn't worked so far".
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I'm thinking, "That is just too funny".
R:  No, that's a bit much. [LAUGH] Well, up here, we do have a smoking ban, where I live in British Columbia, nobody can smoke in any restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or bars even, or lounges, or any public place, like, any public place, buildings or anything.  You can smoke outside.
L:  Well, I would think -- well, see, but I would think that we have a lot of restaurants that have patios --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where you can go sit outside and smoke.  Now, how would they -- why would they want to stop someone if they're already outside --
R:  Because, um, around here it's because it's still part of the restaurant --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the people that are serving there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have a right not to breathe smoke, so the workers --
L:  And I understand that completely.  I just --
R:  Yeah, that's what they did.
L:  -- think that that's taking it a little far.
R:  Oh, you know, we're getting used to it now.  And it -- it really screws up the, uh, the timings in restaurants, people get -- get up and -- and go out for a smoke and sometimes their food gets cold waiting for them to come back to the table.  Now, that's -- that's hilarious.
L:  Right.  Well, are you a smoker?  Are you a smoker?
R:  No, no.  Actually, I tried to smoke when I was younger, but I'm not --
L:  Well, but do you have --
R:  -- a smoker now, but --
L:  Well -- but do you have friends that smoke?
R:  Oh, yeah, totally.  You betcha.
L:  And how awkward is that, that you're going out to eat dinner with them and they're, like, "Oh, I need to go out and have a cigarette"?
R:  That's exactly what they do.
L:  You know?
R:  They go out and then they come back in and that's it.  And it's, like, normal now.  It's hilarious.
L:  Well, I think that would just be too funny.  I'd be, like, "Oh, people, no".
R:  No, i- it -- it's amazing what you can used to.
L:  Well, and -- and, see, that's my opinion, is if it's a restaurant or an establishment that allows -- you know, that has a no smoking --
R:  Right.
L:  -- policy, and I'm thinking, "That's fine, because that's their right".
R:  Right.
L:  And you have the choice of either eating there or going someplace else.
R:  Yeah, and here, there's no one place else, you know, it's all.
L:  But airports have lounges where the people are actually cordoned off and they're, like, in a room that you walk by and you see all these people and they're smoking and there's a haze that --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- sits over the room.
R:  -- yeah, do you have that?  Do you have smoking ban there?
L:  Uh, we do in a lot of -- in a lot of the -- the public buildings --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but in the air- -- in different airports that I've been in, because I do some traveling for my business --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there's different airports that have, like, a smoking lounge, or a smoking room, and my, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my opinion is, you're sitting on the airplane next to someone who either smells like old ashtrays --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but again, you can sit on the airplane next to someone who hasn't bathed in three days.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  But we don't have control over that, that's for sure.
L:  You know, which is the lesser of two evils? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] So, you --
R:  Up here, we're allowed to -- you're allowed to build a special smoking room too, and then people can go in there, but --
L:  Yeah, but, see, wouldn't that make more sense, if you're going to go to the expense of -- of getting these people in your establishment, and you want to be fair to everyone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in your establishment, then that is, uh, to me, that is a- an option that should be con- -- taken into consideration.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  If you don't wanna offer them this option, then, fine, don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But it -- to me, it's a little ridiculous, it's, um, my girlfriend that lives in Anaheim said, yeah, they were trying to fix it so people couldn't smoke, like, at bus stops.  And I'm, like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- they're outside.
R:  That's here -- that's what's coming up next here.
L:  Yeah, and I'm, like, "But they're outside" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- and she said, "Well, yeah, but people don't wanna stand next to you at a bus stop --"
R:  That's true, that's what it's getting to, yeah.  That's for sure.
L:  "-- and smoke a cigarette".  And I'm, like, "But you're outside, what difference is it if they're standing next to you when you're smoking a cigarette and a bus comes by and throws fumes in their face?"
R:  I know.  You know what?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That is -- that is amazing, that, like, you know, you don't even wanna get stuck around -- near a bus in a car or anything like that.
L:  Isn't that true?
R:  Oh, gosh, yes.  It's so hilarious.
L:  Just stop and think of the difference.  What would you rather be?  W- -- standing next to someone [LAUGH] who's smoking a cigarette, that it's taking -- going to take them five minutes to smoke and they put it out, or stand at a bus stop that, you know, every five minutes a car or a --
R:  I know.
L:  -- bus is going to come by --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and blow toxic fumes into your face?
R:  No kidding.  Well, that'll be next, we'll be able to have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- electric cars and buses and everything, [LAUGH] get rid of all, hey?
L:  Yeah, but until -- until we actually have electric cars and buses, I'm figuring --
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  -- don't worry about it, people. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's --
R:  No.
L:  -- enough things out there in the air that are going to kill you. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no, that's true too.  Banning smoking outside is kind of hilarious.  That's true.
L:  Isn't that funny?
R:  Well, yeah, but, you know, I have to go -- I don't smoke and i- -- uh, every time I have to exit a building or come in, I have to go through a bunch of smoke anyway --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  Even church or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  You have to go through it somewhere or another.  And the --
L:  And if it's not --
R:  -- so, now they're all congregating around the doors --
L:  That's it.
R:  "-- and now there's no rules going out, "Well, you can't smoke outside the doors, you have to be out in the parking lot". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  So, they -- they make you go down a block or something.
R:  Yeah, you know what?  I -- I'm sure glad I don't smoke.
L:  Let's see, when we were smoking, we would go to the theater and --
R:  Go to the theater?
L:  Yeah, you'd go to the -- well, but you couldn't smoke at the theater, but we would go to the theater to see a show, and you know how they have intermissions at the theater?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And then -- so, at the intermissions, you're running down the stairs and down the block to have a cigarette.
R:  Yes.
L:  And running back up the block and back up the stairs to go back --
R:  That's right too.
L:  -- and sit.
R:  That's right too.
L:  You know, and you're, like --
R:  Wouldn't it be easier to quit?  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and it was, like, "Oh my God, I'm getting my exercise just going out and having a smoke".
R:  Yes, that's for sure.
L:  But if you wanted --
R:  It really complicates everything.
L:  I know.
R:  Well, you know, when I -- when --
L:  So -- but what if you wanted to have a chat with a friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who smokes?
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Then you're schlepping down the block with them to sit down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and have a chat with them while they're having a cigarette.
R:  I know, it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's too much.
L:  [LAUGH] So, I think it's very funny.
R:  Yes.
L:  It just --
R:  Well, I don't know about that.  You know, I remember when I was a kid, my mom used to smoke Matinee cigarettes when she was pregnant --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and with me and in the house, and all the time, I mean, you just had to duck the cigarette, you know, [LAUGH] or you'd get ashes on you or something.  But everybody smoked everywhere, you know, and now, they just have a ban on it.
L:  I know, and to me, it is just too funny.  Why would they stop it like that?
R:  Well, the workers were complaining 'cause of the secondhand -- the secondhand smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, not just the customers.  Really, up here, it's what they call the Workers' Compensation Board, we have.  And we have to pay -- everybody in business in Canada has to pay a really, really hefty price --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to be in business and you gotta play -- pay these workmen's compensation insurance rates, so to get the rates down, they made [MN] the biggest ra- -- uh, r- risk, which is the air, um, being clean, c- -- they clean up and so their rates go down, but that means that the workers aren't exposed to smoke, but they lose customers.
L:  Right.
R:  So, there you go. [LAUGH]
L:  So, you have, you know, you have a bad choice whichever way you go, you know?
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  So --
R:  -- that's true, so there's really nothing good about smoking, yes? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, and there's -- but there's always going to be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- stuff in the air.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.
L:  You know?  What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna -- you know, people are -- are gonna be like the -- the J- -- what is it?  The -- the Japanese and go outside and -- or Chinese and go outside and wear little gas masks?
R:  Oh, is that what they do?
L:  Well, for the SARS.
R:  Oh, yeah.  No, well, you know what?  If anything can happen, it will.
L:  So, you know, if someone -- to me, my idea is if someone is a smoker then, you know -- and that's the choice that they made, to kill themselves that way --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- I know what you mean about your choices being taken away --
L:  You know, yeah --
R:  -- your rights, you know?
L:  -- you -- I -- I really, really think that everyone should just have a choice.
R:  I mean, how much is it intruding on somebody else --
L:  Excuse --
R:  -- really?
L:  -- me?
R:  How much is it intruding on someone else, really?
L:  And -- and, see, and that was my idea, is, um, you know, what are you going to do?  Are you going to tell them, "I'm sorry, you can't do this because we made a decision.  Who are you to make my decision for me"?
R:  Oh, I know.  Especially outside, as you say, it's kind of cool.
L:  And I -- I think that has a lot to do with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because --
R:  Are you in favor of the -- of inside bans?
L:  I -- I think that that is for the establishment to choose.
R:  Oh, oh, I see.
L:  I think that the establishment should have that choice, and that way, if they -- you know, maybe that they have to get a special license to have someone smoke in their building.
R:  More money.
L:  But, see, but it would solve the problem, because the business will either want to get the special license or not get the special license.
R:  Yeah, well, here they would always get the special license and stuff because then -- the more ways to attract people the better.  But then, a lot of people I know, they don't smoke, even when they drink, anymore.
L:  Right.
R:  And they -- they'll go someplace because -- [MN] 'cause you're -- not many smoke there.
L:  Right.
R:  But they'll sit in the clear part of the restaurant or something, so maybe as time goes by, like everything else, it'll get more popular the other way, 'cause --
L:  Well.
R:  -- people don't remember the old way, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or the way it was, the blue smoke or whatever.
