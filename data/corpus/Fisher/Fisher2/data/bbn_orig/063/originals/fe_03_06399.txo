R:  Kim.
L:  Sonya.
R:  Hi, Son- --
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, Sonya.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Okay, how are you?
L:  I'm okay.  Um --
R:  This is my first time on air, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Oh, well, I personally think, um, most people, during a terrorist attack would panic.  Um, I would like to say at first that I wouldn't, but I -- probably put in the situation, you know --
R:  Same here, same here.
L:  -- I don't know what I would do.
R:  I -- I would be the same.  I think I would panic too.
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  I work in a building that's, like, twenty four stories.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we used to --
L:  In New York, or ...?
R:  No, in, uh, Fort Lauderdale --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- in Florida.  And, um, our ... the people that we work with, they are on the twenty second floor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and our apartment should be up there but I am so glad [LAUGH] we're on the first floor. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] That's good.
R:  [LAUGH] But we do have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, people here that were involved in the September eleventh, um --
L:  Mhm.  I'm in New York, so --
R:  Are you?
L:  -- I watched the buildings fall.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And just seeing that, I don't think that I would be able to just, you know, sit around --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and not panic.  You know, 'cause even that -- you know, I used to work in the World Trade Centers before it all happened.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I -- [MN] I was some seventy blocks away when it occurred but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I could see the buildings --
R:  Oh yeah, of course.
L:  -- from my window and I watched the building fall and as soon as it fell I got in my car and I left.  I didn't even say, "Well, goodnight, you know, I'll see you guys tomorrow" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or, "Is it okay to leave?"  I left.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, I didn't talk to anybody, I didn't do anything.  You know, I didn't panic, but I knew that I was going to leave, regardless --
R:  Right, 'cause you weren't --
L:  -- of what the company said.
R:  -- you weren't in there, you know --
L:  E- --
R:  -- when that happened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I mean, I guess a lot of those people didn't panic enough --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- to get out.  I mean, luckily there was a few --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people here that did, um, that, you know, we're blessed to have working with us but, um, we did lose eighty seven coworkers in that attack.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's hard.
R:  But I think I would -- I would more or less --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- given today's situations and the heightened alerts and ... um, I live close to one of the seaports where they have, um ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... [LIPSMACK] gas coming in, the fuel and oil and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean, if a terrorist was to bomb that, I mean, we're just gone in an instant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're that close.
L:  I always say that too, because I used to live, I mean, blocks away from the airport.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  And now I'm behind the courthouse.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's like, you know, no matter where we go, we are prime targets.
R:  Yep, yep.
L:  You know --
R:  There's really no safe places, I guess.
L:  Yeah, especially here in New York, you know.  And then, you know, I'm unemployed now but when I was working in the city, I worked, um, in Grand Central Station.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, it was like, "Okay, they've already hit the World Trade Center, you know, what's next? [MN] --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- The Empire State Building or Grand Central?"
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so --
R:  Right.
L:  I me-, [NOISE] uh --
R:  Hit the heart of America.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  You know, that's basically ... and -- and it was really strange to have a lot of the terrorists --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- here ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  ... in a sense.  You know what I mean?  Like, some of the terrorists were, like, right down the street from where I was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in some of the airplanes.  So ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know, it's -- it's hard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And thinking -- you know, I have two small children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which makes it even harder. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm, same here.
L:  You know, so that just ... [MN] [LAUGH] it -- it's hard to say, "I would be, you know, strong, I wouldn't panic, I wouldn't" -- but we all know, you know, given the situation, that ...
R:  It's hard to say that you wouldn't until --
L:  N- -- [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  -- you've been there.  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Ninety percent of the time I'm sure most people would panic.
R:  Uh, one of the girls that came from, uh, up there in New York, from one of the World Trade Centers that was lucky enough to get out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, when she first came down here we had, like, a fire drill that went off and she freaked and just started crying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, because it was just too soon for them to be [LAUGH] doing that.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  You know, she just got really scared and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... you know.
L:  Especially because a lot of the people from the World Trade Center died because there wasn't enough panic.  They died because they were told, you know, "Go back to work".
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, and then to think -- y- you know, you don't wanna hear that, especially now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you don't wanna hear someone tell you, you know, "There's a fire alarm going off, it's okay", because you're going to be like, "No, you know, that's what happened before".
R:  Right.  See, every time the fire -- we have fire drills that go off here, my butt is, like, one of the first ones out the door.
L:  Yeah.
R:  "See ya."
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  If they say, you know, "You're fired" for some stupid reason, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at least I have my life, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that's the way I look at it but, um, you know, like you said, it -- it -- it's ... you sit there and say that you -- you wouldn't be ... you know, like, I don't know, the -- the anxiety --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think would take over in me, like --
L:  I think so.
R:  I just -- and I'll be like, "I just gotta get out", you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and just try to get my coworkers out too.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I actually before nine eleven was one of the, um, fire marshalls in our building.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I told them, you know, "I gotta be completely honest with you, I don't know if I could stand behind and wait for everybody else to leave".
R:  Were you at the building at all when any of the attacks had happened --
L:  No, n- --
R:  -- um, like the one -- was it nineteen ninety three or something?
L:  No, no, I wasn't.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I wasn't, I was lucky.
R:  And they had a gentleman --
L:  Because I had started working a year after.
R:  Yeah, they had a gentleman on the news that had said, you know, he -- I guess he was one of the, um, security people there at the building and he --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had a friend that was a, uh, um ... [LIPSMACK] in with, like, uh, the military but he was, like, a special forces -- and he could, like, read the minds, basically --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of terrorists.
L:  Okay.
R:  And he called him up and said, "What do you think -- who -- what do you think a terrorist would do to this building?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he said, you know, "Probably bomb it, you know, try and bomb it" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- which -- that's what they tried doing the first time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, the second thing he said was, "A plane".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But really nobody paid too much attention to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that either, so ...
L:  Mhm.  It's, um, it's horrible, it really is.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  It's horrible, it's scary, it's -- it's so many things that just make you think, you know, it's not worth it to even work over there.  I think that when they build that building back, it's gonna be so hard to get companies to rent space there.
R:  Is that what they've chosen?  I di- didn't know what the --
L:  Yeah, they're gonna build it.  It's not gonna be the same exact thing --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but they're gonna build something and I think that personally it's gonna be very hard to rent out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's gonna be very hard to get people trusting enough to go back into those -- a building of that size.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think they're gonna make it that high but --
R:  Still, just, uh, the fact of being in New York --
L:  And in the location --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] Well, tho- those -- those are the times we live in now, though. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, I -- I just said to my friend yesterday, I'm like, "Oh, did you know that we, ah, went back to a ... another high level of, uh --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- warning?"  It was, like ... but, you know, a lot of people don't take that too serious.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they don't, you know, worry.  Like you've -- you've got two kids, I got two small kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you [inaudible] wanna take it a little bit serious --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think more than others, just given the fact --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I live in a bigger city and --
L:  Yeah, it's a little hard also to take those seriously sometimes, being that New York has been in that state of alert since nine eleven.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I understand, you know, Florida and other places haven't been, but New York has been at that state of alert.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, them moving up the rest of the world and not changing the alert level in New York just kinda says that they're just [SIGH] y- -- precautionary measures, so you --
R:  They've never changed it in New York?
L:  No.
R:  It's --
L:  It's never gone down at all in New York.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  New York has always been at that level since nine eleven occurred, so --
R:  And why is that?  I mean ...
L:  Well, because they say that it's a high terrorist target here, you know.  New York, Washington and places like that are places that, um, terrorists would tend to hit first.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I -- I'm assuming that that's why they'd do it, you know, but it ... so I don't -- y- you know, it's ... they -- also a thing for me, living in New York, the cops and everybody being outside and so forth --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and working in Grand Central Station and seeing the, uh, bomb sniffing dogs and stuff didn't always make me feel better.  It made me feel worse to know that I am in a location that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that has a necessity for it.
R:  Right, right.  If there's a slip up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause, uh, I have a friend who works in the Fort Lauderdale airport and he said the security there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is horrible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He says, "I walked through, I have a pocket knife, it's sticking out" -- you know, because he works in there doing, um, [inaudible] -- doing some construction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, they ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He's doing electrical and he, you know, has got his tool belt on but, hello, that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, got tools in it, it's got knives in it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they let him right on through, didn't even stop him, didn't do anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean, come on, if I went in there and I put on a [LAUGH] tool belt and worked through ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so ... and he says, you know, he's seen a lot of things, working there, and he says, "You don't think it's safe that" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, what they're saying on the news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or anything else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's -- you know, that you have to be very cautious and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I hate flying as it is, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it does make you feel like, uh, you'd rather stay home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than, you know, get on a plane.  I try not to think that way.  You know, my parents, especially my father, always told me, you know, "If you're gonna die it's gonna happen whether you're in the air or on the ground".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like, there was the terrorist attacks --
