R:  Hi, I'm Shirley.
L:  Hi, I'm Kat[?].  How you doing?
R:  [LAUGH] Fine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh --
L:  [LAUGH] What are you laughing about? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, nothing. [LAUGH] Uh, I just think these -- these deals are interesting. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  You never -- I was [MN] th- th- thinking about, "Oh, please don't let it be a man, please don't let it be a man". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, not. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh. [LAUGH] Oh.  Have you ever --
L:  Are you --
R:  -- smoked?
L:  I have smoked for twenty years.
R:  [LAUGH] I never have -- have --
L:  It's a horri- horrible habit to get into, I wish I'd never done it.
R:  Yeah, I never.
L:  But -- y- you never did, ever?
R:  Uh-uh, huh-uh.
L:  You [inaudible] even tried it?
R:  I tried it as a kid, yeah, but, you know --
L:  That --
R:  -- that was -- you gotta try.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  But, [SIGH] I never liked it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and --
L:  I don't know that I necessarily liked it, I think it was more peer pressure because all of my friends did and then I got hooked and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I quit for about a year and then, uh, I don't know, I -- stress or something, started up again, 'cause everybody I knew smoked too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, one of those things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kinda -- I -- but it's weird, because I can go for a weekend without doing it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, you know, I'm stupid and I start again.
R:  Monday morning you gotta pretend it's, uh, still the weekend. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  That's exactly the way I should do it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I also have two kids and I never smoke around them, I don't even smoke in the house.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, I literally go outside --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to do it, where they can't even see me, so it's kinda -- I don't know, it's weird.
R:  The -- the ads, they have, don't -- don't gross you out enough to make you quit?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, it's not -- it's not a -- a matter, at this point, of not wanting to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's a matter of not, um, having the willpower, I guess, at this -- at this present time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  One of those things.  I don't know.
R:  'Cause that was -- was --
L:  But I don't -- I don't know that the ads -- the -- the ads are good.  I don't know that they necessarily work.  I think sometimes -- I mean, the information is good --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- maybe more education on it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than what we -- what we had when we were growing up.  But --
R:  Yeah, well, I -- I don't remember --
L:  -- I'm --
R:  -- anything growing up, you know, it was just -- it was cool.
L:  Exactly.  I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- not -- everybody did in the movies --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, on TV, on even television shows, so you didn't -- you didn't realize what the problem was, so there was no education on it, and I think it's cool that they're educating, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, children now.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I still don't know that that's going to make it stop.
R:  No, because the peer pressure's still going to be there, it's just --
L:  E- --
R:  -- uh --
L:  -- exactly.
R:  -- I don't know, if they can actually realize what it does to the lungs and stuff and, you know, see people that's dying of lung cancer.  Of course, I've seen people dying of lung cancer and they're still sucking on their cigarette.  There's --
L:  Uh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's no hope, they just ca- -- you know, they can't give 'em up. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  My grandfather, he -- well, he wasn't my real grandfather, but my grandfather, um, u- used to [NOISE] -- to smoke and he is dying of lung cancer and he continues.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] He -- he didn't stop.  Most of -- most people don't, [NOISE] once they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- start and [NOISE] --
R:  No, well --
L:  -- I -- I think they figure that they've already [NOISE] gotten to the point where [NOISE] they, um, I don't know, it's like a last thing for them.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think they're so hooked that they couldn't get off if they wanted to.
L:  Well, that could very well be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm very -- yeah, I've had -- I'm not going to argue that point.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Like I said, it's very addictive.
R:  Mm.
L:  I think with me it's more a psychological than it is physical.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause, as I said, I can go for days without doing it, if I've got something going on.
R:  Right.
L:  But at the same time, um, driving, things like driving long distances --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] or, uh --
R:  Well, is -- is it something you've got to do with your hands too, or --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- people say they --
L:  It's a -- yeah.
R:  -- they just gotta have something -- they gotta have that cigarette in their hand.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a oral and a -- I don't know, [MN] [NOISE] oral fixation kind of thing, it's a [NOISE] -- when you have nothing else to do with your hands, you're bored.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- especially, like, my folks live in DC [NOISE] and I live in Ohio, so I go every now and then, it's, you know, probably about, I don't know, once every two to three months --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's -- that's a hard, long trip without a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- cigarette.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I'm bored.
R:  Well, and the traffic back there would be enough to make you smoke. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You got a point there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Now, they -- they did a study, I don't know if you've heard about it or not, but they did a study, [NOISE] um, on this town where they banned smoking completely in it.  Have you heard about that?
R:  Mm, no.
L:  They just did it recently.  M- -- yeah, they -- i- -- I mean, even in their own houses --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- smoking was not permitted anywhere.
R:  Whoa.
L:  And it's [NOISE] a small town, and what they did was -- is they also took the effects of it -- I don't know if it's still in effect or not, or if it was just for the study, I'm not that rehearsed on it, but, um, they were saying that -- I guess the rate of heart attacks, lung cancer, emphysema, illnesses due to it, uh, had all drastically dropped.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's -- it's interesting.  I don't know that I care that the government would take over and tell me I can't do something --
R:  No.
L:  -- of that nature.
R:  No.  I know they're, uh, trying to stop all smoking in public places.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I agree for restaurants.  I hate to start eating something and then have somebody blowing smoke in my face.
L:  Well, that's rude.
R:  I -- I just wanna go over there and take their cigarette out of their mouth and dip it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in their water glass. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What is that saying?  Smoking in a -- or n- not -- the non smoking section in a restaurant is like a non peeing section in a pool.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's not -- 'cause it filters through the air --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so you still get the effects of it.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah, there's [NOISE] no doubt about that.
R:  Yeah, none a- --
L:  And, uh, I don't like it when I'm eating, so I can't imagine how a non smoker would feel about that.
R:  Yeah, well, my husband used to smoke, and our kids just -- it just drove 'em up the wall, and [MN] we -- we were going to [SIGH] church one Sunday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Sunday School and, uh, my daughter rolled down the windows and [SIGH] my husband got onto to her about it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you know, and she said, "Well, I don't want my hair smelling like your stinking cigarette". [LAUGH]
L:  There you have it. [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, he hasn't smoked now for [NOISE] -- I don't know, thirty years and --
L:  Did he quit then?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Did he quit right then?
R:  No, he had to have surgery on his throat.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And he couldn't --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- he couldn't smoke for [MN] -- a w- -- a little over a week, I think it was, and he says, "Man, if I gotta go without a cigarette that long" he says, "I -- I'm just not going to ever smoke another one again" and he didn't.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  Well, it makes sense.
R:  "-- uh, yeah.  And I told him, I said, "If you start up again, I'm leaving".
L:  Wow, that's strong.
R:  Because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, see, he tried to quit --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he -- he was a bear, and he was always down our throats and on the kids and blah, blah, blah, you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I just told him, I said, "I'm not going through that anymore.  You either quit, or you keep smoking".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree with you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that -- that's a hard thing to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a real hard thing to do, i- is -- is to just quit cold turkey.
R:  Well, he did, and -- and he swears that's the only way to -- to go, you know, and he [SIGH] -- he ba-has the [SIGH] -- the ads on helping you quit smoking with the patches and that stuff, you know, and he says, "Ah --"
L:  Mm, I --
R:  "-- it doesn't work". [LAUGH]
L:  -- don't blame him.  I feel the exact same way, I don't know, everybody that I kn- -- that I've personally known and has ever [NOISE] tried that has not -- i- it's not worked.
R:  Mm.
L:  A- any of those kind of things, the step things or the [NOISE] -- the patches or any of that, it's never --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- worked for them.  So, I don't know if it's really [NOISE] -- everybody that I have ever known that has quit has quit cold turkey.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, you just make up your mind.  Until you make up your mind, you don't do it.
L:  Oh, that's just -- I -- I think that's with anything. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, that's with dieting and the -- the whole [inaudible]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You just have to make up your mind, "Hey, I'm gonna stick with this" and -- and that's the way it goes, and --"
L:  I think I'm -- I'm -- I kind of get the -- it's the idea of -- of, uh, my children are only twenty two months old --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I'm thirty five and it's one of those ideas that I would really like to be around a lot longer.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  And I know that that's -- you know, it's --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- obviously probably going to have some effect on my life in the future.
R:  Yeah, that and, uh, you can't tell your child, "Don't smoke" when you're puffing on a cigarette.  Does- --
L:  Oh, exactly.  Well, that's the first thing I --
R:  -- doesn't hold a lot of weight there.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's [LAUGH] -- that's the first thing that, you know, I've said, of course, is, "If I ever see you having one of these --" you know, I joke around with my friends, if I ever see we- -- see them with one of these, I'm gonna kill 'em.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it -- you're right, it would be very difficult.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It would be very difficult to do, so, yeah, I hope they never start any on this, but it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like I said, it's a horrible -- and it's nasty, it stinks, it's --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, your clothes reek and -- and your breath, you smell like an ashtray and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and every -- I mean, I -- I hope I'm not insulting you, but [LAUGH] --
L:  No, you're fine.  I agree with you completely.
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  I really do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know these things.  It's just one of those -- but --
R:  Mhm, it's something you live with.
L:  -- until I make up my mind, you know?
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, u- um, 'cause every now and then I like to go out for a beer or something like that, not very often, but every now and then and that's -- I -- I've found that -- that one year that I did quit and most of my friends that h- have quit, um, that's what they say, is that's --
