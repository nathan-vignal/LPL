R:  Hi, I'm Mercedes[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Jean in Austin[?].
R:  Okay.  So, I guess we're left to talk now, right?
L:  Ah, yeah this is my first call.  Is it just the two of us?
R:  Yeah, it's just the two of us.  It's my first call too --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- so I was a little nervous.  Um but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But it's about smoking.  Did they ban smoking over by where you are, in public places?
L:  Ah, yeah, they spo- -- they banned it, um, as of May fifth in --
R: [MN]
L:  -- in Boston in all public places.  Before that it was banned, I think, just in the restaurant part of the restaurants, but they could still --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smoke in bars and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stuff like that, but now it's totally banned.
R:  Yeah, like it's so tough for me, I mean, because I used to be an ex smoker so I understand why people get really --
L:  So, you're smoking again now?
R:  No.  I stopped, but the only reason why I'm going to say --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.  You say you used to be an ex smoker.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you're -- now, you're a smoker, because you were an ex smoker before?
R:  Ah, no I'm -- I'm an ex smoker now.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't smoke anymore.  But I was getting to why it's tough, because I do work at a restaurant slash bar slash nightclub --
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
R:  -- and before the ban started like everyone was -- you know, it was --
L:  Smoking.
R:  -- kind of like a lounge setting so everyone was smoking and now all of a sudden people call then they ask before hand, "Well, you know, can we smoke anywhere --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the club?"  Like, "Do you guys have a designated area?" because --
L:  What -- what part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  You do -- your ban is pretty new too.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty new and --
L:  Just like ours.
R:  -- so to see that really gets to the owner -- like my boss, he's just aggravated at the whole thing, because no one really wants to come to the club anymore --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- because it was such an intimate spot and everyone just liked coming for the lounge scene and the whole smoking thing and now he's like losing customers because of that and it's weird.
L:  Well, it hasn't been that long right?  So, I figure there'll be an adjustment --
R:  No, but people call beforehand and they're like, "Well, you know, do you guys have any smoking areas left or is that it?" and we're just like, "No".  They're like, "Well, we don't want a reservation".  I'm like, "Okay".
L:  Well, is there anywhere in -- I mean, in -- in Boston it's a complete ban, so it's like the- they would have to go to a completely different city.  Is it different in New York, where there's --
R:  No, it's not a complete --
L:  -- some places where they can --
R:  I mean, somewhat of a complete ban.  I mean it's just in the public spaces, but like outside on the street -- you can still smoke outside --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- on the street.  But you know, as far as like restaurants and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- clubs that's been banned completely.  But I heard on the news --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that there was some grandfather clause and because of it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there were some areas -- not many people know about them, but there are some areas that have been allowed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, to have smoking, ah, in their premises because they've had it for such a long time.  Like there's a cigar bar here in New York and so because of that whole grandfather clause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're allowed to have people smoke there.
L:  But you know, you're saying like you're losing customers because people are calling, but eventually they're going to figure out that you're not any different than any place else and they're just going to have to adjust.  Because it's not just your place --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's pretty much every place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They just have to get -- get that into their head that it's illegal. [LAUGH] I guess.
R:  Yeah, but you know when you're like a die hard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you just can't quit because you've been smoking forever and then you're like [inaudible] a cigarette because you've had such a bad day --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- it's so tough.  But -- ah -- so, I understand -- some of my friends are really pissed off about the whole thing.  They're like, "Oh, I'd rather not even go out if I have to worry about, you know, where I light up".
L:  But you were -- you were -- you're a former smoker and you're working in a place, you must, sort of, be happy that the -- the air is clear now.
R:  Yeah.  You know what it's so funny because I do have friends that don't smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're like ecstatic about the whole thing and every time you head into a pub or like a nightclub, it's always so -- like there's no fog or anything like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so everything's clear and you can actually breathe.  So, it's kind of cool.
L:  I don't -- I don't go out that much anymore because I have little kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but on the few times that I go meet --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- friends in bar I -- y- you -- when I come home and take off my clothes, you have to put them in another room --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because they're so disgusting --
R:  Oh, my God.  That is so right.
L:  -- and stinky.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can't even sleep with them in the -- in the hamper or something because the whole thing reeks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm used to being in a -- in a smoke free like work -- like my office has been smoke free for, ah, probably fifteen years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I remember when people could smoke in the office and they'd come in in the morning and I'm eating breakfast and, you know, the -- we had to share desks and the guy next to me is like dripping ashes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was just so disgusting.  But they -- you know, in those days it was -- it was -- it -- it was totally okay.  So, maybe in a couple of years everybody's thoughts will change and they'll think, "Oh, my God how could you have cigarettes and food in the same place?" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we'll think of that as disgusting, it's just a -- a mental adjustment.
R:  Totally.  I agree and that's why I felt that the second question to -- to this poll was kind of interesting about how they were wondering what our reactions were a- -- you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to whole study and surveys and all of these help lines.  I actually think that they help.  Some of the commercials are just like -- they're funny but at the same time they're very edgy and they just get a message across, especially to the youth, you know?
L:  How did y- -- how did you quit?  What did you use?
R:  Cold turkey.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Cold turkey because I started to notice that I had like this smokers breath --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and [LAUGH] people weren't like talking to me and I was like, "Oh, God.  This must be bad" and my dentist was like, "Well, you've got to stop smoking if you really want healthier teeth and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- this, that and the other".  And I was like, "Okay.  You know what?  You're right".  So, then I just decided to quit and I -- I felt so much better because I felt like my lungs -- like I could breathe better and I started to focus on exercise, so that kept my mind away from the whole --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- cigarette craving.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah, it was cool.
L:  My brother, when he quit, he had to use the patch because he was -- he was really addicted.
R:  Did that work for him right away?
L:  No, it wa- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he had to quit twice.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He quit like once we he got married because his wife was allergic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, but then he would still, sort of, smoke when he was at work.  But then he -- when they were having a baby he quit, quit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then he used the patches and the gum and everything.  And it worked, because he was -- he was motivated not to get the baby sick or get allergies.  The worst thing, I think, is when I see women who are pregnant smoking and they're smoking.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like so unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's not like you can say that you don't know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- that it's -- it's not healthy.  I mean, I think that's pretty much saturated with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody -- you -- you can't -- I can see there are people who are already addicted, but I -- I can't see like why you wouldn't know that it's dangerous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, I think -- yeah, I -- I know.  I think people know that it's dangerous but you know it's -- but it's such a thing -- it's such a craving.  Like when people --
L:  Once you've started?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I guess the thing is to catch the kids before they start --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just so that they don't get --
R:  And that's where I feel like this whole public service --
L:  -- physically addicted.
R:  Yeah, this whole public service announ- announcements, the moment that they come in and, you know, magazines and just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have actors saying, you know, "It's not cool to smoke. --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- don't even bother".  And cigarettes are so expensive also.
L:  Well, that's -- I think that's good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because then if kids can't afford them --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- then they can't get them.
R:  So, I'm just like, "That's great".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they seem to give them away.
L:  I was -- I was shocked.  I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the gas station the other day and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I've never smoked, so I've never bought cigarettes but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there was a sign and it said that the pack was four fifty and I thought --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that was like for a -- a ca- -- was a carton.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] It's like, "How in the world could somebody afford to spend four fifty on -- what is it twenty cigarettes come in a little package?".
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- incredibly [LAUGH] expensive habit then --
R:  Yeah, and you think that that's bad --
L:  -- if you go through a pack or two a day.
R:  Yeah, in New York -- like a pack of cigarettes in the city can cost you about seven dollars.
L:  Oh, no!
R:  Yeah.
L:  This was on -- oh, I don't know where I saw this sign and I was just --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so surprised.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought four fifty was a lot of money.
R:  No, seven dollars.  Ah, four fifty is what we -- what we were at like maybe two years ago --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- before they assigned a tax on cigarettes and then it got insane.
L:  Oh, well that's -- that's -- I mean, that's good then because I mean, kids don't have money usually, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's perfect, you know, but again for the ex smokers and those people that are trying, it's kind of tough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but you know, it -- they're also -- society's just keeping us away -- like, the government's just keeping us away and I guess that's a healthy stride --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's something going in the right direction, so.
L:  Because it's different from alcohol where at least, you know, there's some sort of redeeming social qualities and you can use it in moderation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and not -- well, it doesn't hurt other people for one thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, if you use it correctly yourself and you're -- you're not necessarily going to get sick.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But with the cigarettes, I mean, you're automatically going to get [MN] something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, at least you're going to get bad lungs or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, they said something else about, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um -- oh the -- the quit li- -- the quit lines, like eight hundred numbers, I don't know too much about those but I know I've seen them on the ads.
R:  Yeah, the -- ah, yeah, they're always around I guess, although I've never spoken to anyone that's actually called --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I see them and, you know, I think that if I was in a situation [inaudible] when I was really trying to quit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like awhile ago when I was actually do it, if that was around I would have probably given them a call, you know, because then I probably would have been swayed to stop, you know?  Because it took me a long time to go cold turkey.  I was go- going on and off and then all of a sudden I was like, "All right, I got to stop, today's the day" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but if I had something like a smokers quit line I'd be able to talk to so- -- ah, sort of, smokers I guess or ex smokers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and maybe they would be able to help me through it.  Because it's really -- it gets to the point where you just need that psychological support, you know?
L:  Right.  Like when you're on a diet or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just to know other people going through the same thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think the other thing for kids is to explain like how much the -- the tobacco companies are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- manipulating them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know with the ads and the -- the tee shirts and ah -- and, you know, just making -- making them think that it -- it c- -- that it's cool to do or creating a market.
R:  Yeah.  You know what's really interesting -- or when you get on to the whole ads thing, I didn't know for awhile that, um, most of them had like these little boards for all of these labels that you would --
L:  Yeah, like points and stuff.
R:  Yeah and I had someone -- I knew someone years back who actually was sa-
