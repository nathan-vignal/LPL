R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Annette[?].
L:  Hi, Annette.  My name is Tori[?].
R:  Hi, Tori.
L:  Hi.  I haven't done one of these phone calls before yet, have you?
R:  Um, never have I.  No. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I guess we'll learn together, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Um, so we're supposed to talk about n- -- the new non smoking laws.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I couldn't really hear what they were saying that well, um, [MN] about whether it's a good idea or ...
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I think they want us to talk about wh- whether we think it's a good idea or not and then they want us to discuss whether we feel hotlines or, um, I don't know, education and things like that will -- would be effective.
R:  Um, okay.
L:  That's kind of what I got out of it.
R:  Um, okay.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I think it's a good idea, personally.  But what's your opinion on that?
L:  Um, to ban smoking --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in --?  Well, here -- I don't know where you are, but here they're wanting to ban it in all public places --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and I have no problem with that. [MN]
R:  Yeah, neither do I.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And as far as hotlines and things like that, I think that would be very good, because I'm sure it's a hard thing to quit, since it's a habit.
L:  Yes.
R:  And they need all the help that they can get to quit, so I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if that's -- those are the kind of hotlines they're talking about right?
L:  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Then I think as many as possible would be a good idea, because they would need the help.
L:  Mm.
R:  Wh- what do you think?
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm an ex smoker myself.  I -- I quit, I don't know, about [NOISE] -- almost five years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I know it was extremely difficult and I'm not sure if a hotline would have helped me or not.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I didn't use a hotline, I -- um, it just actually physically made me sick because I -- and I was pregnant, so I just quit.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  But I tried to quit em, you know, a -- a million times before that [MN] and unless you have the will --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- then I -- I don't think anything works.  But maybe education --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- will at least stop people from even starting in the first place.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I've never smoked in my life, so I don't really know how hard or how -- you know, I don't really know what it's like to have to try to quit.
L:  Yeah, it's a pretty tough thing to do.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  But maybe with support -- I'm not -- I -- like I said, it wouldn't have worked for me, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- maybe it works for some. [MN]
R:  Right. Interesting, because I know my father smoked for a long time and he just quit cold turkey, but you know, I've known about three people that have been able to do it like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I know a lot of people can't, so [inaudible] hotline --
L:  It takes a lot of will. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  A lot [LAUGH] of will.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, education would be better than hotlines, then?
L:  Well, sure hotlines for the people that are smoking, you can try, just because I didn't think it would work for me, doesn't mean it doesn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- work for everybody.  Everybody, I think, will have a different way to -- to help them quit.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, maybe that would work.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  So, what are we supposed to do after we discuss this?
L:  Well, we have to keep --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- talking for ten minutes.
R:  Oh, is that what it is?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It seems like a simple topic to talk about for ten minutes, but ...
R:  [LAUGH] Well, what do you think people who do smoke are going to feel about this?  You know, that -- banning in public places, do they think that's a discrimination of their rights or something?
L:  Yeah, I think they would think it's an infringement upon their rights, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but um, at the same time, I believe it's an infringement upon nonsmokers' rights to have to be, um, exposed to a carcinogen that can make us sick and give us cancer and ...
R:  Right.  That's how I feel too.  Um, it's even worse for the ones who -- the second hand smoke is worse than the ones that who actually are smoking, right?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  So, um, [several inaudible words] too.
L:  Mm.
R:  But -- and also just having, you know, young people out there -- your children or something and you're trying to go out to dinner or you're trying to do something with your family and then to see this -- you don't really want [NOISE] -- I don't think you really want that in front of your children all the time, for one thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and [NOISE] yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah, as --
R:  [inaudible] [NOISE] --
L:  -- far as role modeling is concerned, do you mean?
R: Right.  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Like, it's not a good idea for our kids [NOISE] to even see it.
R:  Well, I know they see it on movies and things like that [NOISE] but to see it in real life [NOISE] and to think -- start thinking that maybe it's okay because they see it everywhere.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- so.
L:  -- that's a good idea, because I know if you drive by the high schools even --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- even though it's -- you know, it's not supposed to be legal to sell them cigarettes --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- they're all outside smoking and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kids see other kids and then it's cool and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you've got the peer pressure.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep. [NOISE] Well, hm.  And I wonder if they can start the education in the high school? [NOISE] You know, or in school.
L:  Or even sooner.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [several inaudible words] -- my son's -- hasn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hit grade one yet but I think they start teaching them about drugs pretty early, don't they?
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, I -- hm, well my --
L:  It would kind of --
R:  -- my nephew's in kindergarten and I know he hasn't heard anything, but my nieces are in -- one's in forth and one's in [NOISE] sixth and they already know about it, so.
L:  So, they talk about drugs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in those ages?
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  I think that's probably about the right age to start introducing cigarettes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, they're drugs too or -- in a way, right?
R:  Yeah, I think so.  Because it seems to be getting younger and younger when kids start getting introduced to those things anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.  As soon as possible. [NOISE] That would be a good idea to start the education that [NOISE] -- that early.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] So, your main motivation for quitting was the fact that you were pregnant? [NOISE]
L:  Yes, that was my main motivation and then it was also helped along quite easily by the fact that it made my physically sick to smell cigarette smoke. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- it went from -- it was going to be done regardless of how hard it was but it made it easy that [LAUGH] I was sick --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the easiest quit smoking plan, ever. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not everybody can have that one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, I had a friend when -- in one of the places where I worked and she [NOISE] got pregnant and [NOISE] she would smoke around three packs a day. [NOISE] But she did other hard- -- you know, harder drugs [NOISE] but she couldn't quit [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even though she was pregnant, she kept trying and she couldn't quit and so it got pretty bad, got to the to- -- the point where --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- CFS[?] is saying they were going to have to take the child because it was endangering her life.  So, as soon as the baby was born --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- and all this stuff.  So, sometimes it's even stronger than that will, huh? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I guess and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I know -- I've heard that doctors had -- in the last couple of years have been telling, um, pregnant mothers to not try to quit because they're saying the stress of quitting smoking is worse than smoking.
R:  [NOISE] Huh. [NOISE]
L:  I've heard a few people have been told that and I'm actually --
R:  Wow. [NOISE]
L:  -- quite appalled by that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no kidding.
L:  I think a little bit of stress is way better than carcinogenic's entering --
R:  Right, it can cause a whole lot of -- either brain damage or physical deformities and ... [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is -- that's strange.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.
L:  It is strange. [MN]
R:  Yeah, it is.  Hm.  So ...
L:  I wouldn't have taken that doctor's advice anyway [LAUGH] myself, but --
R:  Yeah, no kidding.
L:  -- you know, people --
R:  What about after you -- oh, go ahead.
L:  No, go ahead.  I'm done.
R:  Well, after you quit smoking, was it hard for you to -- to stay away from it, would a hotline h- help then?  Even though you got through it on your own, do you think hotlines would help then, like after you quit?  And you probably get the craving still, even when you smell it right?
L:  I do.  Yes.  I go -- I don't go out much anymore because I have a family now, but um, if we go out to a bar or something and I'm around a lot of smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I will crave a cigarette for a few days.  So, maybe -- maybe a hotline would help through that, but I'd just feel so pathetic phoning a hotline --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- about something like that, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can get o- -- I can get through it myself, but um, maybe some people would utilize that --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- in that way.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, ten minutes seems like a long time. [LAUGH]
L:  It -- doesn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Give us more to talk about. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  Maybe if we disagreed, this would be easier. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh ...
L:  Um.  Hm.
R:  Yeah, this is my first one, so.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  This is interesting. [NOISE] Mm.
L:  Right.
R:  Let's see, what else? [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I was just thinking, "What else?".
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  What else can you talk about? It's just ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I had -- I had a -- an opportunity last time to talk about time travel, I could have talked about that, I guess --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for over ten minutes, this smoking's just too simple. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.  Well, I hope a lot of people agree with that though, to pass that law --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because it just doesn't make sense not to.
L:  Well, where are you -- you're -- you have an American ac- accent, you're from the States?
R:  Right.  I'm in Arizona. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  Wel, I'm in -- I'm in Alberta, Canada. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] --
R:  You don't -- I don't hear an [NOISE] -- yeah, I don't hear an accent on you [NOISE] --
L:  It's because I --
R:  -- is -- is that where you --?
L:  Oh, sorry.  I don't have an accent. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, well --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I don't know, have they passed any laws [inaudible]?
R:  Well, yeah it's not allowed in -- it's not allowed in public places here and I know when they were trying to pass it, they did have a lot of -- you know, a lot of the smokers were trying to, um [NOISE] -- we- were going against it and doing all that and trying to fight it but it still got passed [NOISE].  But there's still -- there's still some restaurants -- I mean, I thought that was a state wide one, [NOISE] but there are still some restaurants, like in little country towns [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- where the- they do allow the smoking.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, I thought that was state wide, but then you go into these little places and people are smoking, so I don't know.
L:  Is it just restaurants or is it all public places, even bus stops or outside of schools --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or hospitals or ...?
R:  Um, it's -- I think actually the answer is restaurants. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Here they've done restaurants as well  --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and a -- but a restaurant has a choice of being --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, an adult only [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- eighteen and over.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And if they're eighteen and over then they can allow smoking, but if they're a family restaurant they have to, um, ban all smoking.
R:  Oh, okay.  Actually, I think that's the same as -- the same way it is here, because I did go into a restaurant recently --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I think they claimed to be a bar --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so that [several inaudible words] allow smoking.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  But they're trying to push it now for all public places [NOISE], like outside of malls or hospitals --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or schools.  You can't smoke --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- there, but that's not passed yet.
R:  Yeah, well I do hope that that gets passed.
L:  Yeah, I'd be happy to see that.
R:  Mm.
