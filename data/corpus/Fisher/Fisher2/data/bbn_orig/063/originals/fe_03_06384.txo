L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Karen from Michigan.  How are you?
R:  Hi, Karen, I'm Donna from New Jersey.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.
L:  Early this morning.  You're up early this morning too.
R:  I -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] I'm always up early. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I work nights and by the time I get home it's two --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and go bed, it's two o'clock so -- I still get up at seven.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how do you like our topic of the day: terrorism and how we'll react?
L:  Um ... hm.  I guess here in Michigan we don't really have a lot of nonsmoking laws.  I guess, like, in New York, I guess, you can't smoke, like, in public places and things like that.  But as far as going to a restaurant, we have a choice, you know, whether you can take smoking or -- or nonsmoking.  I kind of wish sometimes there would be different rooms [inaudible] 'cause I have asthma --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and sometimes if we are seated we're right next to a table, like, over the wall somebody's smoking even though we're in the nonsmoking section.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't think it should be banned, but maybe [NOISE] have a little bit different area set up for if you want smoking or nonsmoking.
R:  Yeah.  I guess your topic of the day is smoking, 'cause mine is terrorism.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  They always make this mistake.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  N- no, I haven't.
R:  [LAUGH] They always give you -- us both different topics to talk about.
L:  Really?
R:  So, I guess we could talk about either.  We could talk about the nonsmoking or --
L:  [LAUGH] So you've done this before?
R:  Yeah.  I've done it twice before.
L:  Okay.
R:  But -- a- and both times before it's always been a different topic for each of us --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then we -- we had to decide --
L:  Which one.
R:  -- which one.  Did we want to talk on terrorism --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and how it affects us, or I guess yours is nonsmoking?
L:  Right.  It said if smoking should be banned in public places and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- how do you feel about smoking programs being offered for stopping, uh, smoking and ... um, how do you view smoking in public places.
R:  Ah, well, we could --
L:  What was yours?
R:  -- talk about that because you're a nonsmoker and I'm a non- -- I'm -- and I'm a smoker.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I feel totally different than what you do.
L:  And yours was on terrorism, right?
R:  Mine is on terrorism.
L:  Well, we can talk on that one.  Well, do you want to do that one?
R:  Yeah.  That's an ea- -- that's an easy one for me.
L:  It is. [LAUGH]
R:  Because living in New Jersey, you know, um, we're only about an hour and ten minutes out of New York City --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that's always a concern for us down here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like, we live near quite a few military bases, like, um, not right on top of 'em but in our state where we live there's military bases so, you know, it -- it's -- it's a real scary thing.
L:  It is, and then I think we were just raised to high alert too.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Just the other day they said ... 'cause they said there was something --
R:  We went to orange, yeah.  And -- and there's just times, like, when I will not go into New York City.  And my son lives there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he works there and, you know, he goes, "Oh, mom, y- you know, you're crazy" but, you know, I'd rather just not take the chance --
L:  Mhm, and it was scary --
R:  -- to go in.
L:  -- after that nine eleven.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, who would have ever thought something like would have ever have happened?
R:  Ever happened.  I guess that's not a real big concern in Michigan, like, you know, terrorism?
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Is it -- is it really a big concern where you live?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  See, and here -- and here it is.  You know, I mean, like, people talk about it all the time.  You know, um, [LIPSMACK] what's going to happen.  And plus I'm right on the coast, and our coast is such a ... a -- a wide, vast area that I -- you know, like, how could people -- how could you be protected --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, living here?  But they asked in the question, like, you know, did -- did I think that people would, um, panic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and yeah, I do.  I think people ... I think people [MN] worry about it but I don't think people really prepare --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for -- if something could happen.
L:  [NOISE] And then the Academy just never bounced back after that --
R:  No.  No.
L:  -- terrorist attack.  It's just ...
R:  Mhm.  And it --
L:  ... scary.
R:  You know, I've -- never went down to see ground zero, although we've been, like, really, really close.  But, you know, like, when it happened, my son doesn't work far from there and, you know, so much just stopped.  But New York people are, like, very friendly people to begin with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he said that after the attack, like, people were more friendly, you know.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Like, he --
L:  Like, it really opened their eyes to ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... life in general, yeah.
R:  'Cause I come from there, I talk to anybody, I don't care, you know, but he says, "In New York you kind of go along and you mind your own business" and he says that this was, like, such a common thing now, that everybody would talk to everybody, like, you know, if you -- he was taking the subway to work or something, he says he found that more people w- -- ha- had something in common to talk about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was their fear, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I hear you have little kids.
L:  I do, I've got a three year old and a two year old. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, we've been up since six o'clock this morning. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.
L:  When they hear dad go to work they get up and around. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Mine are all grown, my baby's now thirty one. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, so ...  So, they don't really think about things like that, like, it doesn't scare them like it does kids, I mean --
L:  No, and when the terrorist attack was on and stuff I tried not to have a lot of the TV on so they c- -- wouldn't see what's going on and ...
R:  Yeah.  I think kids here --
L:  ... stuff like that.
R:  -- are just the opposite --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- it's a big topic in school and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, what they should do and, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how they should feel and be aware.
L:  And I -- right, and think it does scare the kids, you know, seeing all that on TV and stuff.
R:  Sure, sure.  I mean, it scares me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I get addicted to the TV set, you know, watching CNN or, like, out east here it's Fox News and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, because you a- -- wanna hear every little thing that, you know, our Government says and -- I think our Government doesn't tell us everything and sometimes I think that's bad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And sometimes I think it's a good thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I think it would make us, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- immobile if we didn't -- if we knew every single thing that was going on, but --
L:  Right, especially the terrorist alert now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They probably know where it's going to be and everything but w- -- everybody would probably panic and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it would cause more problems if they released the information rather than just send --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- secret military [LAUGH] officials or whatever wherever the area is that ...
R:  But I think you have --
L:  ... is a problem.
R:  -- the right to know where they think it's going to be and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you wanted to not move but, say, you wanted to go on vacation for a week because -- like, here they -- they were saying it didn't -- well, originally when they started it was going to be for three days, you know, that they had definite proof that things were going to happen and, you know, like, say I wanted to go west for a week because I was scared, you know, I should have that opportunity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to say, "Hey, you know, they have Washington targeted".  But, you know, like, even we live by the Jersey shore and thei- their predicting a [inaudible] a lot of, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seasonal and vacation tourist people come here.  And they're even predicting that a lot of people won't come here this year.  And i- it's a big part of our economy.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, and I think it's just the opposite.  I think people are gonna drive to go someplace, versus --
L:  Fly, mhm.
R:  -- get on a plane and go someplace.
L:  Right, and then -- I know even in Florida they shut down, um, that great big garden, that bush gardens but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I can't remember the ...
R:  A lot of the parks got closed down there.
L:  ... um, Cypress Gardens.  And that's been in business for years but they said after the nine eleven attack --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that tourism just went down so much that they can't afford to keep the park open.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's been open for years.
R:  Well, we go down in February for the Daytona five hundred --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- races, the NASCAR races.
L:  Okay.
R:  And we stay -- my niece lives in Orlando and we stay there and we found, like, there was definitely not a lot of people in the park, like -- and it's Presidents' Week so a lot of kids have off of school, and the parks are usually packed.  But we found, like, we had no problems getting into restaurants.  Like, it's always a wait, you know, 'cause it's a big tourist attraction.  We had no problem getting in the parks --
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  -- no problem --
L:  Wow. [NOISE]
R:  And, like, in Universal, like, you'd wait to get on the rides and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it ... there was no wait.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, and we were --
L:  And that was on a weekend, or was it a weekday?
R:  No, we g- -- for the whole week, it's Presidents' Week so --
L:  Oh, for the whole week, wow.
R:  Yeah, so a lot of people, um, uh, you know, go to Florida that week 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the kids have off of school.  And even the Daytona five hundred, like, we noticed there were a lot of seats empty.
L:  Empty.
R:  Which never happens with a NASCAR race.  You know, the --
L:  Wow, and then -- and the other thing too, from probably the terrorists attacks, [several inaudible words] people just aren't spending money 'cause [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- companies aren't giving raises and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's just -- just not a lot of extra money too that people have and ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, the thing is is after the Septem- -- n- nine eleven --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we go to a Daytona ra- -- um, [LIPSMACK] a NASCAR race in Dover, Delaware, and that was spooky because it was the first large, major event of any kind like, football or anything that was right after nine eleven and this -- it's --
L:  Ooh, so it was scary to think --
R:  It was, because --
L:  -- something would happen.
R:  -- there's, like, a hundred and seventy thousand people there and it's, like, you kn- -- you were really scared.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, like, they had, um, you know, military helicopters, um, you know, flying in in the air --
L:  Wow, they did over the event?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, so it was really scary and there was a large -- large amount of security to get in and ... you know, and that scared you alone.  It's, like -- because when you get out of traffic wi- -- places like that, I mean, you could be sitting in traffic for hours tr- trying to get home and it's --
