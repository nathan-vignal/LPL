R:  Yeah, Julius Young, I'm a teacher for -- in Washington, DC.
L:  Uh, what's your name again?
R:  Julius from Washington DC.
L:  Julius.  Hi, Julius, I'm Dana, I live in Indio[?] Mississippi.
R:  Really, hey, how you doing?
L:  All right, way down in the south.
R:  Right.
L:  Anyway, I didn't understand fully what the -- it was on banning smoking?
R:  Right, they wanna ban smoking --
L:  [NOISE] -- in public --
R:  -- in a lot of public places.  Do you think that's a good idea or you can just use other programmes.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I don't know.  I'm kinda biased on that.  Um, I, myself, I don't smoke.
R:  Right.
L:  I have a four year old that I don't want her to smoke --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but at the same time I have family members [NOISE] who -- who do and they seem to get pleasure out of it and when they're restricted like that it's, you know -- you know, they feel like it's a violation of their rights.
R:  Right, I mean it is.  I mean, I was just up in New York about two months a- -- yeah, about, um, yeah, about a month ago and, um, this guy he was a bouncer and what happened was he told these guys -- two guys to stop smoking, they got mad and killed him.
L:  Oh my.
R:  And he -- and he had, um, a little daughter too so, I mean, basically the smoking ban was the main reason why this guy got killed.
L:  Well, I hope -- that's -- they went a little to far, didn't they?
R:  Yeah, I mean, but when -- they said [several inaudible words] stuff like that could happen and it's, uh -- and it's not needed, I mean, they spent a million dollars of -- uh, to implement this programme but it's not worth it if one life is lost, let alone a few which could happen.
L:  Ex- exact- -- and in this day and age, you know, people are really -- they're extremist about their rights and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything.
R:  They're uptight, man.  I mean, I think the wisest way to go about things would be to -- to just overprice them. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, yeah and I -- I kind of agree with that.  Of course, you know --
R:  Just over --
L:  -- they -- things like that they like -- with my dad, my dad always said, "Well, if they go to four dollars a pack I'm gonna quit" and -- and he did and then they started coming out with generics so it gave him something else to go to. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But -- but I -- I do -- I do believe that money could -- could curb a lot of it.  It, you know, couldn't -- extra tax and, of course, nobody likes extra taxes but add -- adding extra money to it would slow -- slow some things down.
R:  Right, I mean, it's all big business though, these people have monopolies on our tobacco [inaudible] they can -- they can make a lot of money off of taxes that they put on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean --
L:  And I work in education, I know what that money could be directed toward that.
R:  Right, I --
L:  Not only educating people against smoking but educating people period.
R:  Where it -- really, yeah.
L:  You know, it --
R:  I work -- I'm a teacher in the city in DC.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, it's like --
L:  What do you teach?
R:  Uh, I teach, uh, math.
L:  Math, okay.
R:  And that --
L:  I work -- [NOISE] I work in the business office --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with -- with the public school system here.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  It's, um, definitely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of things could be used through money for, uh, cigarettes --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- in, uh, education but a lot of people feel like they need to let loose and they wanna smoke and they find that's the best way --
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- to smoke.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, my -- my dad is been a smoker probably since he was about thirteen and, you know, I mean, it's just -- 'course I'm sure he realizes the consequences of what it's doing to him but it's just one of those pleasures in life that he -- you know, that he chose for himself and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything but I -- I do wish that, you know, looking on the health side of it -- I wish there was some kind of ban that -- that would touch him, that would make him stop.
R:  I think really the basic way that the problem's gonna stop is through people looking at their parents is -- I'm pretty sure that people, uh, because my dad he smokes a lot -- he still does he smokes cigars now but, I mean, he spent a lot of money on cigarettes, doing the math, and how money you could have --
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  I mean --
L:  See we've taken that angle with my dad before explaining to him what a -- a carton and half a week over a year's time and [NOISE] over ten year's time adds up to and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and everything but -- but it just -- it's something.  And I'm really -- 'cause I -- like I say I have a four year old, I don't smoke but her dad does.  Now, the family I came from there's three -- I have a brother and a sister, we watched my dad smoke all those years and we chose not to and everything but I -- my child, you know, she's -- she's gonna be a little confused, you know, momma don't, daddy does and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything and [SIGH] to find a way to take care of it now before she's old enough to make that choice would be wonderful.
R:  Right.  I mean, I actually see it as something where people basically learn from their parents, if they wanna do it or not.  I mean --
L:  Mm, right.
R:  -- everybody I know that smokes -- everybody -- everybody's parents -- I met most of my friends parents and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and -- and the friends I have they don't smoke just because of what their parents used to do.
L:  Right.
R:  And really I don't necessarily feel a lot of educated people smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For some reason I don't think there's too many college graduates that are puffing away and, again, it's just to do, uh, something.  I think, it's definitely more of a minority than a majority of people who are smokers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That hav- that have a degree or some type of higher education.
L:  Mm, know the consequences and realize it.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, you being a teacher and being in education you probably know education's probably the best route then. [NOISE] You know, maybe if they could put that extra money on there and everything in- instead of it being for reading, writing education maybe it's education against not smoking and -- and try to touch as many kids as you can.  'Cause I think that's the route there is -- is catching the kids before they get old enough.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I -- I, myself, don't know too many adults that waited until they're thirty to start smoking.  You know, kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- start when they're thirteen.
R:  And plus, man, just -- just, um, emphasizing the money and it's the usual thing, uh, because really in DC you spend about thirty one hundred dollars a person on leisure activities, entertaining and this is the most in the country so that's just per person.  Everybody spends about three thousand dollars a year --
L:  Mm, okay.
R:  -- just on leisure and things that we like to do.  So, I mean, if you just curbed that, I mean, you've got yourself like a vacation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or something like that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, but, um --
L:  Exactly, or retirement.  I mean, you know, take somebody that starts working when they're eighteen and if they could just set that aside in thirty years, I mean, it -- it would add up for 'em.
R:  Right.  I mean, that's thirty -- that's thirty one hundred that is -- uh, money we have [inaudible].
L:  Right.  Exactly, and, um, interest and compound and -- and it'd be a nice thing.
R:  Right, I mean --
L:  Course, I guess, if we don't smoke we all have our evils and --
R:  Right, I think --
L:  -- and everything.
R:  I think it has to be done reasonably too because down south, I don't know, uh, deep, uh, deep in south, I'm pretty sure people do things differently.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As far as the smoking and things like that.  See I think it's -- it's probably more prevalent to see smokers down south than you would up here.
L:  Yeah, I'd -- and I'd -- I -- you know, well there's those other evils with that, there's like the dipping and, I mean, I'm --
R:  Dipping [inaudible], yeah.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- I -- I think I see that more here than -- than I do further north and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything but it's just -- and -- and I do think it goes along with -- with education, what people -- what they know and what they perceive is okay and -- and everything.  And -- and that's kinda sad, you know, the south kind of gets dumped on like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything but, I mean, it's a reality.  It is reality.
R:  Right, I mean, but the same thing about the south, like, you're more [inaudible] or people are more real about things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they -- I mean, they got a lot of stress now because they certain things but they just can't have 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because of one reason or another.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Makes a difference.
R:  Right and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- smoking's one of their outlets so should it be banned in all public places?  No, I don't think so but, um -- because in New York it's a real problem, man, it's -- it's not really working at all, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they gotta cl- they got clubs up there where you've gotta check in your cigarettes.
L:  [NOISE] Oh my, that's --
R:  Yeah, where you --
L:  -- extreme.
R:  Right, so --
L:  It is.  Well, I'm --
R:  -- it's definitely a problem.
L:  It -- there's not too many -- you know, we make, uh -- we have a little breakfast place [NOISE] on the corner up here, you know, and half the restaurant is smoking and half is non smoking and that seems to work.  But as far -- now theaters and things like that you don't -- you don't do any smoking but [NOISE] -- but it just, um, [NOISE] it's just not a -- it's not [NOISE] always a bad thing.
R:  Right, I mean, smoking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- na- -- people are gonna do it --
L:  Regardless [NOISE].
R:  Right.  People are gonna do it regardless --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, banning it in public places that's -- that's against -- that's against their right, man, because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really you can have it in different spots.  It's been this way -- it's two thousand and three now, people were smoking way before -- way before all these laws --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and things have ever been thought of.
L:  Right.  Even back to --
R:  And it never gave anybody a problem.
L:  -- Bible times.
R:  It never gave anybody a problem and it's all about, um, priority of the person now.  Yeah, I like it where -- sometimes in office building you understand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but that's where people work, that's where -- that's, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's, uh, an environment where you have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all coming together to make your living but --
L:  Yeah.
