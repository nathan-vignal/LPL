R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Angela.
L:  My name is Suzanne.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you.
L:  You too.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, so we're supposed to be talking about smoking?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  I personally do not smoke.
R:  Me neither.
L:  I don't necessarily think it's a great idea to ban it in all public places, just because, you know, I personally don't enjoy it when I go out to eat, but I don't think that they should necessarily get that taken away.
R:  Hm.  We had a lot of, um, hullabaloo about this recently.  Um, I live in the Dallas, Fort Worth area --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, actually, I live in Arlington, which has had, um, no smoking in any of the restaurants, except in areas that can be separately ventilated, and recently --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- they did the same thing in Dallas, and it was really upsetting for a lot of people.
L:  I can imagine.
R:  Um, but, I don't know, I -- as -- as someone who just cannot stand to be around sm- -- [MN] um, I think it's a good idea, and don't --
L:  I d- -- I do agree.  I personally -- I don't like it all, o- obviously because I don't do it, and I d- -- and I would rather not be around it, but to ban it all out completely, it's obviously going to make a lot of people upset and it's just, you know, to me, I would rather it not be that way, but ... I don't know, I just kind of feel that it's kind of difficult to take that away.
R:  Well, there was a business owner that -- 'cause I listen to talk radio a lot and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there was a business owner that called in and said he hoped that they would ban it, because, you know, a lot of people were saying, "Well, if you, as a business owner don't want it to be a smoking establishment, just say, 'No smoking' in your particular establishment" but you can't do that, because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- people will get offended, but if it's a ban on everybody, then you can say, "Oh, sorry" you know? [LAUGH] I --
L:  Exactly, that's true.  That's true.  If it's going to be universal, across the board, I definitely am not going to protest.  Like, I'm not going to be upset --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's just I think it's a difficult position, you know, if it's ever -- it's up -- if it's up to every individual business --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then I think that's gonna cause a lot of conflict and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- personally, to me, you know, I'd rather it not be around but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I'm not going to stop going somewhere just because they allow smoking and somewhere else does not.
R:  Well, and as long it -- they're separate.  You know, I hate walking past the smoking section to get to the buffet.
L:  Definitely, me too.
R:  But if they're off in their own room --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's fine.  Fine.  We went to lunch today at a Don Pablos Mexican restaurant and the bar is off behind glass closed doors in the -- in the way other area, and that is perfectly peachy with me.
L:  Exactly.  That's a great set up.  I just -- I mean, like I said, I really would prefer it not to be there.  I personally don't feel that we should have to be put out just because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- someone else would like to smoke, so if they're going to se- -- you know, not really segregate, but if they're going to make it where --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're all blocked off, make them go the back --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then that's one thing.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you have to make a decision, and if you decide it's important to you to go smoke, then that's what you have to deal with.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.
L:  But, to me, I personally -- you know, I'm not going to be out there protesting for smokers' rights --
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  -- because --
R:  [LAUGH] Me neither.
L:  -- you know, I'm perfectly fine with the ban on smoking, I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] be uni- -- c- -- universal across the board --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or, you know, I just don't really want to be involved in the de- -- [LAUGH] you know, the decision.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true. [SIGH] Well, do you think the anti smoking ads work?
L:  You know, I don't really know.  That's a -- that's a good point.  I don't -- personally, to me, it's just -- and it's -- again, it's a personal thing, I think it's -- I think it's disgusting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, I would really rather not be around it, but then, you know, if someone chooses to do it, that's their decision, I think, you know?   I -- I would -- I've never smoked once, and I have no desire to and, I don't know, I'm pretty sure I never will but, you know, it's just -- it's kind of, um, to me it's just disgusting.  I would --
R:  I -- I think it helps a little bit, because so many people were hooked when they were young --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's when we didn't know how horrible it was.  But now, everybody knows how horrible it is, and if they start --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- it, they are going in it with their eyes open, and I think those ads are +helping to op- -- uh, open the eyes.
L:  Well, that's a great point, and a lot of people, you know, I understand, didn't know that it was bad, didn't know that there were going --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be effects from it later on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but we do know that, and now that, you know, to get the news out there, "Hey, this is not going to be good. You're going to suffer some sort of effect from this --"
R:  Exactly.
L:  "-- regardless of if it's, you know, today or tomorrow or in twenty years".  I mean, even if you have --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a cough and it lasts longer than a cough from a non smoker --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in some way, there's going to be an effect from it eventually.
R:  Exactly.
L:  We [several inaudible words] now that they are able to get that information out there and tell these people, I think it's great, because they need to know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know, m- -- if one less person starts smoking, it's definitely worth it.
R:  Oh, exactly.  Ex- -- and especially if that one person is my child.
L:  Definitely.  Definitely, I completely agree.
R:  Yeah.  So -- well, I don't know how long we're s- -- uh, do they cut us off, or how does that work?
L:  I don't know, I've never done one of these before.
R:  Me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I heard about it on my, um, Refunding Makes Sense site on the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- internet and I know we can do --
L:  Yeah, I got an email from somebody, and I just did it this afternoon --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- I was really surprised to --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- find out --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- so quickly, but --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- okay, that's fine.
R:  But we can do, like, three of 'em, so --
L:  I know, I know.
R:  -- that's cool.  Well, I don't know.
L:  I don't know.  I think we're supposed to keep going, just because -- I think at the end is when they say, "Okay, then now you're supposed to give us comments and feedback" or something.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Well, I have two niece- -- two cousins that are fifteen, they're twins --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they smoke.
L:  Ah.
R:  And their mother is severely addicted, and she's smoked since she was a kid.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she provides them with cigarettes.
L:  Ah, wow.
R:  And I -- they are really so super, super poor.
L:  Mm.
R:  They have food stamps and they get welfare --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but they find a way to buy their cigarettes.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  And I just am --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- dumbfounded at that, in fact, I was gonna have my cousins come visit this summer, and -- but I have two small children and I said, "You will absolutely quit before you come here".
L:  Right, well, I really feel that, you know, if the person that's smoking, I think they should completely be considerate of the people that are around them, because, you know, if it's your decision to do it, that's fine, but I personally don't think I should be inconvenienced because of your decision.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I -- it's -- I -- I think it's stupid, I mean, there's so many things that can -- that we don't have control over, you know, like September eleven, for example, nobody had a choice about that, and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to do something that you know could cause cancer, I just think it's absolutely ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.  They're -- they're always talking about smokers' rights, their right to smoke, but, gosh --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- what about my right not to breathe it?
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I hate when they -- they say, "Okay, no smoking in this building" and then they stand right outside the door.
L:  Right.
R:  And you have to sm- smell it [LAUGH] when you're --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- walking either in or out, and especially when employees of a business --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are, you know, right outside the business.
L:  Exactly, and, you know, it's even, like, you know, sure, we choose to go to a restaurant, you know, maybe they allow smoking, but then you leave and your clothes smell like it --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and your hair, and it's just, like, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I understand, you have your own prerogative, and if you choose to do it, then, you know, that's something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you decide.  But I just don't think it should be something that inconveniences other people that didn't have that choice.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  I [SIGH] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's just --
R:  And my mom, she smoked for years.  She ended up quitting, but, um, she owns a business that, um, they just sit in there and -- and smoked all day long --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and she had to replace equipment after equipment that was just corroded because of the smoke --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in the air.  And that makes you think, gosh, that's just equipment, what about your [LAUGH] -- your --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- lungs, your body? [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, there's definitely worse things, like if all restaurants would go non smoking, to me, you know, it wouldn't affect me either way, I'd definitely prefer it --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- but, you know, if it's not something that everyone's made to do, then I think all it's going to do is cause more problems and more conflict --
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  -- and then there's going to be an uprising from the smokers and it's, like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- y- -- [SIGH] that's crazy, I mean --
R:  But, you know, part of it is too, I think a lot of society has gone with the -- the rights of the one are outweighing the rights of the many --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't like that, but in a lot of ways, that happens, you know, "I smoke, so I should have the right".  But what about the ten people around you who don't want to -- to smell it?
L:  Exactly.  And unfortunately, sometimes one person's voice is, you know, the one person that chooses to speak out may be the person that's the smoker, and just because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, to me, I'd rather not be around it, but I'm not going to go and protest.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know?  And so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, yeah, that person is louder --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but that doesn't mean that they represent a, you know, a fair part of the population.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  So, it's interesting.  I'm interested to see, I didn't know that Dallas, you know, had, you know, legis- --
R:  Where --
L:  -- is it legislation right now that's pending?  Or --
R:  Um, they just passed it.  They just --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- passed that ban and it really made a lot of people upset.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
R:  But of course --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- talk radio went nuts with it.
L:  Oh, I can imagine, because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even I heard a little bit about it, up in New York, where, you know, there's a lot of people that are upset and, you know, it passed and there's protesters and they're not happy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, you know, I mean --
R:  Is that where you're from, New York? [NOISE]
