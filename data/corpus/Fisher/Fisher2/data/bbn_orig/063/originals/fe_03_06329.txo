L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.  My name is Kevin.
L:  I'm Laren[?].
R:  Hi, Laren.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I guess the topic of the day is supposed to be, ah, smoking -- at least we'll be talking about. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and whether the -- whether we approve of it banned in restaurants.
R:  And -- right.  And I know in, like, par- -- I guess in, like, public places, restaurants, things like that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well -- well -- well, let me say right off the bat I'm a, um -- not a smoker at all.  Ah, I've taken two puffs of a cigarette in my whole life, and frankly I despise the habit myself.  I think it's a -- a foul, ah, disgusting habit with -- with no redeeming value to it.  So, [LAUGH] that's my stupid mouth smoking right off the bat[?].
L:  Well, I smoked for about forty seven years.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, I think non smokers have gone too far.
R:  In what -- in what way?
L:  Like, on the -- ah, saying, ah, they can't have a cigarette here, or they can't have a cigarette there.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that's going too far.
R:  Right.
L:  They always say that the smoker interferes in their lifestyles.  Well, the non smoker is interfering in the smoker's lifestyle also.
R:  Well, let me -- let me say this; even I -- I am a non smoker and I'm vehemently against smoking, but I -- I don't think I'm -- I don't -- I don't -- as -- as much as I am against, ah, smoking in certain places, I don't think I'm a -- [MN] I don't think I'm unreasonable about it.  Now, I do believe that restaurants and bars do have the right to decide whether they want smoking in their -- in their establishments or not.  Ah --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- I -- I know if I owned a restaurant there would be no smoking in that -- in that restaurant.  And I've heard that, you know, people will say, "Well, that will hurt business".  Yeah, maybe so, maybe not.  But, I believe there are enough people who would agree with me that I don't think it would hurt business that much.  But, ah, I believe that large restaurants -- I believe that they do have that right.  Um, I've been in, ah, places where, ah -- eating establishments -- restaurants where, um, they had non smoking sections, but the -- but the place was so small that, you know, basically it didn't help.  And I can tell you, it's a -- you know, it's not a -- it's not a [SIGH] pleasant, ah, thing to have smoke wafting into your face. It -- it -- it's just not.  Um, and I think that I -- I -- and I agree that non -- there are some people who are non smokers --can be unreasonable, but also there are smokers who can be unreasonable also.
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  I mean, um, it's not -- if you're not a smoker, it's not pleasant to have smoke -- cigarette smoke wafting in your -- your space.  It -- it's not.
L:  Usually most of your, ah, non smokers that are causing the most trouble are your reformed smokers.
R:  Well, you don't have one here. [LAUGH]  Yeah, I -- I -- well, I know -- I know the type you're talking about, ah, the reformed smokers.  Ah, I -- I know a few and, yeah, there -- there are those out there.  The reformed smokers tend to be, um, you know, the most vehement against it.  [MN] I guess just sort of like the born again Christian, I guess.
L:  Yes.
R:  Sort of.  Well, [MN] I'm not a reformed smoker.  And like I say, I've taken two puffs of a cigarette in my whole life, and that was when I was a [LAUGH] teenager because I was curious.  So [LAUGH] -- but, um, again, I -- I don't -- [SIGH] I don't believe that I'm unreasonable.  I -- now, in -- in terms of, like, public buildings and things like that, um, I -- I -- I think that having smoking areas for smokers -- I don't -- I don't think that's an unreasonable thing.  Um, I don't think that's -- I don't think it's unreasonable to ask, ah, smokers to go to a certain area in a public building to smoke.  I don't -- I don't --
L:  No, I'm --
R:  -- believe that's unreasonable.
L:  I agree with you there, but I -- what I -- what I was meaning was, ah, making people go outside or -- ah, I don't know what part of the country you're from, but here in Iowa some of 'em are even trying to say that, um -- they're even trying to get it to where you can't even smoke outside in the public area.
R:  Outside the public area?  Really?
L:  No, you can --
R:  Well, now I -- I -- I do think that's going a little bit too far.  I mean, I -- I think that's -- yeah, I do think that's going a little bit over board.  I'm -- I'm call -- well, I'm calling from Pennsylvania.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, yeah, I mean -- now, in the Pennsylvania -- now I -- what -- what's going on in Delaware now -- there's down -- there is a movement now -- there has been a movement in Delaware.  They talked about it.  And I think this going a little bit too far, to have smoke -- to have people not even to be, ah -- not even allowed to smoke, um, in, ah, some of their own homes.  And I think that's going way overboard.  I do think that's going way too far.  I believe that you should be able to smoke inside your own home.  Ah, so I think that's going way overboard.  And yeah, I -- I -- I think that outside, um, people should be allowed to smoke.  So, I -- I think that's going too far.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  Um, but, you know, um -- you know, I -- think I might've said it myself, I mean, I've always been -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I -- I mean, I -- I've been a non smoker all of my life and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah well, I think that sometimes both sides can -- can get a little bit, ah, unreasonable, ah, at times.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um --
L:  I agree there too.
R:  You know, I -- I think -- I think that as long as, you know, um, smokers don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try to -- and, you know, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] as long as they don't take it to a point where their smoking is, um, making it uncomfortable for other people who are non smokers, ah -- ah, you know -- um, I mean, you know, I think they should be allowed to smoke.  I mean, I -- I mean, frankly -- I mean, if I had my wish, I would [LAUGH] -- I'd like to ban all smoking, but I -- I can't do that.  But, again, I -- um, I think that, you know, as long as smokers are willing to, you know, accept, you know, areas in public buildings where you don't -- specifically are allocated for -- for smoking.  I mean, I -- I -- I think --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that we can both, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- co exist, ah, together.
L:  Oh, I agree.  But --
R:  Well, let me ask you this; what do you -- what do you think about, like, ah, ads -- ah, campaigns, ah, aimed at kids?
L:  I don't -- I don't feel --
R:  Or -- or --
L:  -- any ads --
R:  -- or -- or -- let me see now -- not kids, but, ah, aimed at teenagers.  I mean, um, you know, some of these, ah, posters and -- and campaigns aimed towards young people -- teenagers. 
L:  [NOISE] I don't -- I don't think they should aim at any certain age level.
R:  Right.
L:  But, they're too, ah -- it falls back on the parents [NOISE] because they really shouldn't be that +susceptible to, um, [NOISE] be swayed by an ad --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to have 'em do something wrong.  Ye- -- I mean, if -- if they're going to consider it wrong, they shouldn't be swayed by an ad, if you get what I mean.
R:  So, you -- you think they're -- it's a -- for -- if -- if a young person, let's say a teenager, is -- can be persuaded by an ad, you think it -- it falls back on the parent?
L:  Yeah, because if -- if -- if they're going to tell 'em that it's wrong and that they're still going to do it well then they're not teaching them right.
R:  Right.  Well, [MN] -- well, I -- I think that, um -- I think it's with a lot of things with -- with -- with teenagers, you know, that -- that old, ah, forbidden fruit thing.  I mean, ah, you know, you're told you can't do this, you can't have that, you can't do this.  Ah, you may have a parent who may say -- you know, ah, who may tell their -- their teenager that, you know, smoking is -- is bad for them.  And there are some who will, you know -- it's the old forbidden fruit thing -- you know, well if my parent -- if my, you know, ah, mother and father tell me that this is bad for me, ah, I [MN] -- I wanna try it, you know, ah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, that -- that old, you know, forbidden fruit thing.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I know that, ah -- I know in certain, um, parts of the country here, and here in Philadelphia, um, there have -- there have been attempts as to, ah -- to punish a, um, s- store owners who sell, um, cigarettes to, um --
L:  Oh, they're fined --
R:  -- underage --
L:  -- out here.
R:  Ah -- or they are fined --
L:  They're --  
R:  -- out there --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- too -- also?  Yeah.
L:  But, they're -- and, ah, if they've got the second or third fine they lose their licence.  And that's even in the supermarkets -- any place.
R:  Right.
L:  If you sell to anyone that -- I believe now the age is under the age of twenty one, um --
R:  Under the age of twenty one?  Really?  Oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wow.
L:  In fact, they have signs up saying that if you're under the a- -- a lot of the supermarkets here have signs up saying if you're under the age of forty be prepared to -- to, ah, show your ID for alcohol or tobacco products.
R:  If you're under the age of what?
L:  Forty.
R:  Forty?
L:  Forty.
R:  If you're under the age of forty you --
L:  You are -- they can ask you for an ID.  And if you don't have an ID you aren't gonna buy 'em.
R:  Holy mackerel.  Wow.  Under the age of forty, phew.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Holy smoke.  That's, ah -- phew.  Okay, all right.  That's -- that's a new one on me.  That's -- wow -- under the age of forty.
L:  Yep, that's what they -- that's the supermarket that I go to.  They have a sign right at the cash registers.
R:  So, if you're thirty five years old and you don't have an ID or --
L:  You're not --
R:  Well, you -- 
L:  you're not gonna --
R:  -- you could be --
L:  -- buy --
R:  -- denied --
L:  -- cigarettes or booze of any kind.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay. Yeah, well, that's -- that's a new one on me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm.
L:  [NOISE] And I think, um -- I think the first time that they're fined it's, ah, [NOISE] I think a hundred for the store owner.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I think it's a hundred for the, ah, clerk.
R:  Hm, okay.
L:  And then it k- --
