R:  Ah, my name is Tina[?].
L:  Hi Tina, I'm Aimee[?].
R:  Hi Aimee. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, what kind of hobbies do you have?
R:  [NOISE] Ah, the hobby I -- that I pursue the most is mostly, ah, couponing and refunding.
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  [MN]
L:  Isn't that funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I bet you're on that website aren't you? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  The Refunding Makes Sense website?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where I heard about this too.  Oh, how funny, everybody's been talking about how they're talking with people on that website and I still hadn't yet, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's neat.  Where -- where are you at?  What --
R:  I'm in Brownsville, Texas.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Washington State.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  Yeah, that's about the only hobby I have that [NOISE] I -- that I really stick to.  There's other things I like to do but that's the one that I stick to.
L:  Yeah, it -- it definitely helps with the -- with the bad economy doesn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that and, ah, I still have six kids at home and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- yeah, I, um -- I'm a stay at home mom, so that's [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that always helps. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, good for you.  Yeah, every little bit helps --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  --  that really does help me.  I've done it since --
R:  I -- I don't [inaudible] --
L:  -- jeeze, I think since I was thirteen or something.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  I -- I think.  I remember getting all kinds of free product coupons for my mom and she just got -- always got so excited, you know, and I -- I was always so embarassed about it and now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm like, "Heck, no way.  That's the way to save money and --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- be able to spend your money on other things".  So ...
R:  Yeah, there's always something that come- -- you know, there's always something else you can spend it on.
L:  Exactly.  Something that -- you know, a vacation or -- I mean, I've done that before where I've just saved up and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- taken a vacation and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that's always kind of neat because it's just a really big reward that you earned, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just by doing that, by saving money, so.  Yeah
R:  Is -- uh-huh --
L:  I like the garden and stuff too but yeah the -- the main one I do is that, but ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, [several inaudible words] and, ah, I like playing games on the computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but only if -- whenever I can get on the computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with, ah, six kids --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't always [NOISE] have time.  I -- I go on really early in the morning --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- otherwise I don't get it done at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, did you say you home school too?
R:  Ah, yes --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- three of them, not -- not all of them, only three.  Ah --
L:  That's impressive.
R:  -- we're a blended family, so the other three have always gone to public school where mine did not and never have -- have never gone to public school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's kind of an interesting mix. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's neat though, that you guys can do that, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Um --
L:  That's got to be very challenging.
R:  And I haven't worked out -- I [several inaudible words] -- I worked outside the home for awhile but ah, it -- it didn't work too well.  I mean, it was okay but it just took too much time and I just could -- it was -- I had to stop. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, plus if you have that many kids and you try to pay for day care you -- sometimes it's not worth it, you know --
R:  No, it -- it isn't.
L:  -- to even try.  So, yeah.  I'm lucky that -- my husband and I have different days off so we really are only concerned about three days out of the week, so that -- that at least helps, you know, he's got different days off than me, but -- but it's still very expensive for three days a week, so you know, day care's not cheap.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But -- so, what else are we supposed to talk about?  The, ah --
R:  Ah, I guess -- what was it, hobbies and [NOISE] --
L:  If everybody should have one?  Well, I totally think everybody --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- should have a hobby.
R:  Yes --
L:  You know?
R:  -- everyone should have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something --
L:  Something they enjoy doing.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] to keep your mind off of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff.  I -- I've tried walking but I don't always do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, plus -- I mean, we live in extreme south Texas it's, you know --
L:  Hot? [LAUGH]
R:  -- the, ah -- [NOISE] the -- the international bridge to Mexico is probably just no more than about a mile or so away. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, it's very, very hot here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all year round.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Even -- even the winter isn't winter. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  So, it's kind of hard if you're going to walk or you're going to run or do any type of exercise outside, you have to get it done real early in the [NOISE] morning.
L:  Oh, [inaudible].
R:  Yes, son?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I'm -- go to bed, I'm --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm busy, okay?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What's your average temperature there?
R:  Ah, right now and it's night time it's -- it's in the eighties.
L:  It is?
R:  Yeah.
L:  At night?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh -- oh, my gosh. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, you can get -- in December it'll probably get up -- like -- you know, heat index wise --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it gets up to like a hundred and ten, a hundred and fourteen.
L:  Oh.  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, yeah the air conditionings on [NOISE] and you can't even feel it. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's like -- well -- well, you don't even leave the house probably it gets so hot.
R:  No, we -- I try not too. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  B- because I will -- go to bed already. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, you were in bed, why are you up?  Go back.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, how funny.  That's what we're doing too.
R:  Yeah, when I signed up I said I could take calls at two o'clock in the afternoon and ten o'clock at night because that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about the only time [NOISE] --
L:  When you have some free time?
R:  That I have -- uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  However, my first phone call, the other person wasn't there.  I talked to myself.
L:  You're kidding me?
R:  I think I said, "Hello.  Hello.  Hello?" about a million times and then the thing said that my, ah -- you know, the ten minutes were up and I hung up.  So, I don't know if that one was a valid one [LAUGH] or not.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Hm.  Well, that -- that Jeanette[?] from Minnesota that's always talking about this, she says that you can -- she did it five times, so, you know, if that doesn't count then they'll probably give you another opportunity, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, this is an interesting -- I've -- the other gal that I talk to was actually in Washington State, just on the other side of the state and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that was kind of interesting.  I had a good conversation, but -- yeah, I saw it on the -- on the website tonight and I thought, "Oh, how funny.  I hope --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody -- I get hooked up with somebody that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- has the same hobby as me" and I did. [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't -- I didn't think I would get picked because I usually don't get, you know, picked for a lot of stuff.
L:  Yeah, it sounds like a lot of people are.  So, there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it must be a really big study.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, they --
R:  Mhm.  I, ah --
L:  -- because of --
R:  I think -- us- -- sometimes I get stuff from PineCone which -- I mean, PineCone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can be a whole other hobby really, so.
L:  It can be, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I really like them.  Yeah, I -- I do them too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's always nice when you get offered the product to try too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and if you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get additional payment with that too, so.
R:  [NOISE] And -- ah -- you -- do you have children?
L:  I do, I have two -- two girls, eleven and seven.
R:  Do -- do they do that Kid Size thing, because --
L:  They do, they just signed up for that.
R:  -- my kids do that also. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah and they really love it -- they just love it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think it's so neat that somebody would actually want their opinion on something.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Because they -- you know, they've seen me do surveys and all this and see the cheques come --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in and they always say, "Well, ah -- well, jeeze mom, you know, how did you do that?" and now they get to do it themselves.  So, they just love it.  So, I'm glad they have that.  You know I meant to sign them up for it a long time ago and didn't and, you know, just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of let it slip through my fingers and thought, "Oh, it's probably not that good of a thing" but that website, boy I can get a lot of information from that, so.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yep, they're doing really good on that.
R:  [NOISE] I only do the -- I only do the three, ah, younger ones because you know, they're at the age when it -- but ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it still works out well.  I couldn't imagine doing all six --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- they'd always have to be on the computer though.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, that would [LAUGH] take forever.
L:  Mhm.  Do they get very many, um, ah, surveys?
R:  There's some -- the younger ones do.
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] --
R:  They do their -- ah, the older one doesn't get as many anymore --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the younger ones still get a lot of them. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  How old is your oldest?
R:  Ah, the oldest i- -- the one that's gone from home, the oldest is twenty --
L:  Well, the one that does the surveys.
R:  The one that does that surveys, that one is -- let's see, he's four -- fifteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's just turned fifteen. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, the youngest that does them is eight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And he's the one that gets the most of them. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, mine are seven and, ah -- and the oldest is eleven --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the seven year old's gotten the -- only -- you know, gotten one survey -- well, she's on her second survey and Britten[?] -- and my oldest has only gotten one.  So, she's going, "Well, how come they don't want my opinion?".  "They will, just relax" [LAUGH].  It just depends on what they're asking, so.  [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, we've -- we did it all of last year and this year. [NOISE] It's getting to where I think they may pretty soon have enough money to -- to take it out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because you know how it has to be a certain amount of money before they can take it out.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah and I don't know what that is but --
R:  [NOISE] I think it -- it has to be a minimum, I think, of like twenty or twenty five dollars.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Otherw- -- you know? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [NOISE] [MN] but they usual- -- they enjoy doing the surveys and, you know, that ke- -- that's a hobby in itself also if you're --
L:  It is.
R:  -- signed up for a lot of the -- a lot of the ones that are on there.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Ah, but the -- the one I concentrate on most is PineCone because the others, sometimes they don't always come through.
L:  You're right, they don't and you spend an awful lot of time and -- yeah, and don't get anything for it and that's --
R:  Yeah, I've had one -- I don't remember which one
