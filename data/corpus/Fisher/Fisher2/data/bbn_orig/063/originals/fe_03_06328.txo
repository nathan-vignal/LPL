R:  Yeah, hello.  How you doing?  My name's Allen.  I'm in New York City.
L:  Hi.  Um, my name's Patty, and I'm in Philadelphia right now.
R:  Oh, right.  Well, you're not far away.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  And --
L:  Not too far.
R:  -- it -- smoking is the topic.  I don't smoke.  And, ah, actually I'm all for the banning of it everywhere and anywhere. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.  I'm -- I feel just about the same way.  I, um -- it's [LAUGH] -- in fact, I, ah -- my youngest son started smoking and I told him he was either gonna get out or put a patch on. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  And, ah --
R:  -- smoked one cigarette in my life.  I was nine years old.  We found a pack of Camels where I, ah, grew up in Brooklyn.  And, ah, nine years olds are inquisitive. And we lit one and it didn't smoke that well.  So I ate one, and it ate worse.  I turned --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- green, got sick, never smoked another cigarette in my life.
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I, ah --
R:  It's the God's honest truth also.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, here in New York City they've already banned it.  
L:  Sort of.
R:  Ah, the mayor's been, ah, kind of crucified about it because businesses are saying it's affecting them.  Like, restaurants and bars.
L:  Right.
R:  But, it's been banned here for, ah, a couple of months, I think.
L:  Huh.  So --
R:  So --
L:  -- how does that work then?  Do they, ah --
R:  They can fine people.  And they just --
L:  They --
R:  -- started giving out fines.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  They actually have people -- and we need the money because we have a big deficit.
L:  All right.
R:  So, they have people going around, I guess --
L:  To --
R:  -- marshalls, ah, looking into the matter and --
L:  And this is on -- 
R:  -- going into --
L:  -- indoor, right?
R:  Yeah, this is anywhere in public indoors.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- ah, it's always been banned -- for a long time now in any public building, like, -- like, ah, schools --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  State run.
R:  -- ah, the courthouses, and whatever it is as far as that goes, but now it's everywhere.  Anywhere --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a public entity is.  So, it's kind of interesting.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Lot -- lot of press about it.
L:  Well, I don't know what they do here in Pennsylvania because I'm just here visiting my daughter.  But I -- 
R:  Where are --
L:  -- we live in --
R:  -- from actually?
L:  Ah, Utah -- Salt Lake City.
R:  Oh -- oh.
L:  And in Utah they  -- they're pretty tough on smoking.  They -- they don't have very many, um, smoking sections anymore.  In fact, I don't think that in our area -- the restaurants you can smoke in anymore.  I -- I think probably the bars you can, but -- but, um, [NOISE] most of the rest of it is, you know -- unless, ah, one -- it seems like once in a while you'll get, like, one restaurant owner who's a real die hard and he'll just continue doing it until I guess he gets fined into oblivion or something. [LAUGH]    
R:  Over here --
L:  But --
R:  -- I think now it's only --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  like, a -- a cigar bar --
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  -- that -- what was a place where you smoked before -- is still able to do it because that was the essence of the business.
L:  Right.
R:  But, otherwise, l- like, it's, like, totally over with.  They used have, ah, spots in restaurants and stuff like that.  And bars always you could smoke.  But now, it's -- e- even night clubs and -- and they're really truly actually starting to crack down.
L:  Right.
R:  They've actually been issuing the tickets, and they had a big thing in the paper.  The first tickets, I think, were, like, last week, I think I read.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause they've been giving warning, and now they give ti- --
L:  Mm.
R:  And the ticket is to the establishment.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it's not cheap.  It's, like, five hundred bucks.
L:  Right.  So, they better run over there and tell them to put their cigarette out quick.
R:  Well, it's happening that they do that.  Sure.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  It -- it's a -- you know, personally I think wh- -- you know, if you wanna smoke it's your business personally --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- but it -- it -- it's proven that it kills you.
L:  Right.
R:  The bottom line is eventually it'll cause deterioration that you're gonna either die from it or get some kind of complication.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Well, and I'm --
R:  -- I don't see the point.  I really don't.
L:  I'm a nurse and I see it every day.  And the thing that surprises me -- I mean, I watch all these people who have emphysema, and congestive heart failure, and they have C.O.P.D. and -- and they still smoke.  You know, it -- it's incredible.  And they just won't stop, you know.  And then --
R: Well, it's addictive.
L:  -- and --
R:  There's no --
L:  Right.  Well, and then --
R:  -- doubt about there's addictive agents in it.
L:  What kills -- what kills me is then you watch the health care workers [NOISE] do the same thing. [NOISE]  And they -- and they, ah -- they smoke too, you know.  And I was just watching a -- my daughter taped [NOISE] for me -- she taped ER for me because I was gone when it was on.  And, ah, I was watching it and sure enough here they showed the two doctors, you know, out in the middle of Africa -- and they're lighting up, and the nurse is lighting up.  And I thought it's really sad that they do that because I think they can do all their little programs that they want to, which I don't -- I don't know that they're real effective.  I mean, my son got a ton of 'em and he still started smoking wh- -- although I -- I -- I think he quit. [LAUGH]  Um --
R:  I hope so.
L:  But, yeah, I hope so too.  I mean, he -- I don't -- he's in college, so I don't see him.  He's away from home.  But, as far as I know, once he quit, he quit.  But, you know, it, ah -- it just -- I can't believe how much they promote it by putting it on shows like that.
R:  Oh, it's kind of amazing how, like, every other movie and TV show it does seem to have people smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't think it's necessarily integral part of the character's make up.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, I just -- they -- they have it for whatever reason.  It's, like, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think of James Bond -- James Bond smokes.  You know he smokes and, like I say -- but he stopped, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sean -- when Sean Connery played him, he smoked.  Now he doesn't smoke anymore.
L:  Now he [NOISE] doesn't.  Ha.
R:  So, I -- I mean --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- if James Bond stopped, th- they could stop --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it everywhere.
L:  Right.  And I think it's not -- sometimes when you see it on TV it almost makes it look like, "Well, everybody smokes".  And I don't -- I don't think it's representative of, um, the public because I don't believe that many people are smoking in comparison --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- they're making a lot of money, I'll tell you that, the tobacco --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- companies.
L:  Yeah.  Unfortunately.
R:  And they're paying a lot for it, to the states.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.  Like, have you done these -- these phone things before?
L:  I haven't.  My daughter, um, actually just enrolled us while we were here.  And -- and this was my husband's and he wasn't available, so --
R:  This is the second time I'm doing it. 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And I -- I don't know how they pay you.  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Supposedly, I think, it's ten dollars for each call.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R: But, ah -- ah I don't --
L:  It is.
R:  -- know how -- how it happens.  And I guess maybe --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- after a while --
L:  -- she said.
R:  -- they mail you a cheque of something.
L:  Yeah, I think so [NOISE] because they record it and everything.  But, you know, I -- um, yeah.  And she's had some good calls on different things.
R:  At first I thought it was going to be, like, with a moderator.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And -- and last time they called it -- it was about actually, um, [LIPSMACK] -- ah, I forget what the heck it was, but it was, like, it struck me as really odd.  And the guy I was talking to was in Boston, and we almost -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, it was minimum wage and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and the raising of the minimum wage.
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  And we kind of, like, didn't know where to go with it.
L:  Oh.
R:  With smoking I think you can --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- argue one way or the other --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- for hours.
L: Well, and I have a lot of -- you know, my -- my son in law smokes, and he -- and he smokes because he can't quit.  And he's trying -- and he's tried so hard and, um -- and he just can't seem to -- to do it. 
R:  If he wants --
L:  And --
R:  -- to truly, truly quit, and he's willing to up with the inconvenience and the hassle of doing it -- whether that means changing his -- his -- his lifestyle as far as exercise to moderate his weight, because you're gonna gain weight from eating more or whatever.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You can do it.  I've known people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who -- who -- who have quit.
L:  Oh sure.  Yeah, my --
R:  It's all --
L:  -- dad --
R:  -- a matter of --
L:  -- smoked --
R:  -- willpower.
L:  -- like, for forty years, and he quit.  But, ah -- but, yeah it just -- it is.  It -- it really -- you just have to -- I think it's one of the hardest things people can do.  That's why I didn't want my son to ever start --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- because --
R:  It's a horrible thing --
L:  -- like --
R:  -- if any kid starts.  You know what's bad here -- is they tax it to death here.
L:  Uh-huh.   
R:  And I don't know how anyone can afford it.  It's, like -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- eight dollars a pack of cigarettes.
L:  Or be willing to pay it.  I just -- I'm just too tight. [LAUGH]  My money mean too much to me to -- you know, to, ah, be willing to do that.  I just won't pay that -- that kind of price, you know.
R:  When I was, ah, a youngster -- when I was in high school I got a job parttime, in the summer.  Ah, my uncle got me one in the VA hospital, on a federal program.  It was paying, like, forty dollars a week.  We're talking about nineteen seventy three -- seventy two.  And, ah, cigarettes were twenty six cents a pack.  And in --
L:  Oh.
R:  --the commissary you could buy two.  And --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I had friends where I lived at the time.  And every day I brought home two packs for one of my friends.
L:  Wow.
R:  Hey, I didn't smoke, but they wanted it.
L:  Oh sure.
R:  Twenty six cents was cheap.  And back then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- maybe they were a dollar fifty in the store -- a dollar twenty --
L:  Right.
R:  -- five. 
L:  Right.
R:  Now it's eight dollars a pack.
L:  Right.
R:  Seven --
L:  Well, and --
R:  -- seventy five --
L:  -- I think it's --
R:  -- seven fifty --
L:  -- cheaper --
R:  -- eight dollars.
L:  -- in other places.  We were over in Germany and I think that -- I was surprised to see how many people over there -- and I think it's common in Europe too -- but, it was, like, there it did seem like everybody smoked.  And they have no laws limiting it at all.  So, you're -- you sit down to eat somewhere and you got somebody right next to you.  I mean, they don't have such -- such a thing even as a smoking or a non smoking section.  You just gotta hope that somebody doesn't sit down and light up right next to you --
R:  It's part of their --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- society.  In fact --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's impacted our tourist --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- trade here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because --
L:  And I --
R:  -- they don't wanna come now.
L:  Yeah.  Well, and I think that -- that those, ah, companies that -- you know, they can't -- their money is limited and they're putting out for law suits here. So, now they're having -- they're looking for other markets, you know.  And the American culture is so big there that -- you know, because most of the people I saw smoking, they --
R:  Marlboro, huh?
L:  -- smoking -- yeah. 
R:  Yeah?
L:  Or Camels, or whatever.  Yeah.
R:  They -- Phillip Morris makes their --
L:  Right.
R:  -- money overseas.
L:  Right -- right.  So, they're gonna push it everywhere else because they can't push it here so much.  Although, I think they do in -- in underhanded ways, you know, like the television.
R:  I don't know.  I just, like I said, can't see the, ah, [MN] -- I don't think it's a disgusting habit.  Some people think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, you know, disgusting and they're -- they're almost violent about it.  I just don't like it.  And I don't see --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how it's good.
L:  Well, and it doesn't make sense that somebody would -- I mean, when you see all, ah -- all the material that's presented against it, you'd think that no one [MN] -- people would never wanna even pick it up and start, you know.  And that's why I'm so surprised that with all the education they get they still -- I mean, you know, kid -- people I went to school with, we did, you know, opened up corpses and looked at lungs that were black spotted.
R:  Actually --
L:  And --
R:  -- I've seen it --
