R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Joy.
R:  Hi, I'm Donna.
L:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you from?
R:  Uh, South Carolina.
L:  Okay, well, I'm in Texas.
R:  Oh, Texas, okay.  I -- I kinda hear the drawl.  I guess we both kinda have southern ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we can -- we can rebel against the north for a while.
R:  Oh sure, sure.
L:  Um --
R:  I -- I'm sorry, but I could not understand what the topic was.
L:  The subject is terrorism.
R:  Terrorism.  Okay.  I could not understand her.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  And even when she was talking about it, I couldn't understand.  I was like -- I hope you [LAUGH] heard better than me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, um, they wanna know how we would react if there was a terrorist threat and how you think the general public would react.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, just by, um, uh -- well, I teach school and, um, I teach fourth grade and, you know, when the nine eleven happened, um, you know, we were just in shock and [MN] that day during -- you know, at school, I just kept it from the kids 'cause I didn't think that was something to address, you know, at their age.
L:  I agree, I agree.
R:  And, um, I thought it would better for 'em to get home and -- and talk with their parents.  But, um, you know, I was just in shock.  I couldn't -- you know, we had the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- computers, the Internet and everything we were getting, it was just, um -- you know, I didn't know what to say 'cause, uh, we'd never been faced with such a thing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, um, you know, I just think the first reaction is shock.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think that -- I think probably in the next year we're gonna have some more attacks on this country, 'cause we didn't do a good enough job when we went into Afghanistan.  We didn't go w- -- in with enough troops to close that northern border, so he got loose.
R:  Well, I just --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- I don't think they've gotten enough of the -- the big people that are behind it either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they're still out there and they've got their followers and, uh, yeah, I definitely think we're gonna have more -- more trouble here in our country, um, you know, in the near future. [COUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  And it's scary.  It's scary, um, to think about it 'cause y- you know, you think about it when you get on -- you know, "Do I wanna fly?  Do I wanna go to places where" -- um, you know, we're having the -- this weekend is, um, the race.  They have the big, um, Coca Cola six hundred or whatever in Charlotte.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live right outside of Charlotte and, um --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- you know, they -- you know, you think something could happen there with all those people, um, all in one place.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I was -- was thinking when they did the superbowl, it'd be a perfect target, you know.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But --
R:  So it -- it's just scary.
L:  I don't know, uh, when they'd asked about how I would react, whenever I've been -- I'm a [several inaudible words] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I've had to go out and unravel wrecks on the highway with bodies everywhere.
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  And I've always been real calm through it; it's just that when I go home I may throw up my lunch.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  It kind of hits you later.  You go through --
L:  Yeah, it -- it's just like --
R:  -- those emotions.
L:  But w- -- but when I'm dealing with it, I'm just real calm and -- and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- take care of the problem and get everything calmed down and, uh, it's not till later that it just kind of settles down what happened.  But -- but in a time of crisis I'm usually pretty calm.
R:  That's good, that's great.
L:  But, um, I'm also -- I -- I do substitute teaching and I --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- got called late the other morning and found out that the reason they called me was, uh, nobody else wanted that class from hell.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  It was a kindergarten class.
R:  I tell you, if you can substitute, you can do about anything, 'cause, you know, they're the --
L:  Well, I couldn't handle 'em.
R:  Oh really.
L:  I -- I mean, the t- -- principal came down.  But their teacher was out sick, [LIPSMACK] had been sick, on the medical leave for six weeks, and it wasn't pregnancy, something else.
R:  Mm.
L:  And they -- and their regular sub didn't come in. [LIPSMACK] The other subs have already been there; they weren't going to come in.
R:  Wouldn't come back, yeah.
L:  And ...
R:  And this is kindergarten?
L:  And they called me and I st- -- and dumb butt me, I should have had enough sense to say --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "No, I won't go".
R:  And it was kindergarten?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  There were three kids -- there were three ki- -- they put one kid in there that was nonverbal ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... [LIPSMACK] which was lovely, to add to the mix.  That was --
R:  How many did you have?  About how m- --
L:  Um, I think seventeen at one time.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  And I -- I felt like a one legged man [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I felt like I -- but I didn't panic and scream, but I think I was a little bit too calm.  If I had screamed they would have probably --
R:  Maybe --
L:  -- been better.
R:  Mhm.  They might be used to that, you know, more.
L:  Yeah, but, uh, I don't know, it -- I just [SIGH] ...
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I don't feel like you get too much -- [MN] some people can scream and holler and that's fine, but it's just not me.  I mean, I'll scream and holler at my kids, but not at a bunch of kindergartners.  I mean, I don't want them going to the office, saying, "She was gonna kill us" or whatever, so --
R:  Yeah, kindergartners are -- uh, you know, they -- they're such babies but yet they can get headstrong too.
L:  Oh, they can be meaner than the devil.
R:  And you have to really have -- I -- I like the older.  I've taught, um -- I used to teach eighth grade and now I'm teaching fourth, and I just like the -- the older ones where you can -- you know, when you say, "Sit down and get started" --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well you can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you can teach 'em something.
R:  Right.  And you can see some results.
L:  You can -- and with the kindergartners you're just trying to get 'em to calm down.
R:  Right, right.  Um --
L:  And I fell like you're actually babysitting.  I, uh --
R:  Um --
L:  Some of 'em I don't think really should have been in school.
R:  Yeah.  Weren't ready.
L:  Bu- -- yeah.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  But as far as the terrorism goes, uh, [LIPSMACK] I don- -- I'm not gonna, like, go out and dig a hole in the backyard.  I figure if they're gonna get us, they're gonna get us.
R:  Well, you know, it's kind of like --
L:  But at the same time, I'm not gonna go somewhere where they're bombing things.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Like, I'm not gonna -- li- like, I'm not going to go over to Afghanistan and act like I were the Pope or something.
R:  Right.  Well, you know, I didn't -- when the, you know, those -- the warnings or whatever to get the tape and have a secure place, to tape up, you know, your windows and stuff --
L:  I've already got the tape but I didn't feel it was going to do any good.  This ha- --
R:  Well, I didn't either.  I d- -- I didn't understand that, and that kind of made me just kind of -- you know, you get --
L:  [NOISE] Well, if you think about it, if you're taping things, if the house is porous at all, it's gonna come through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all you're doing is perhaps prolonging your time before you die.
R:  Right.  I thought at that point you're --
L:  And, um, you know, if you really wanna go crazy, just go out and get a gas mask, but it'll probably be something that -- that that gas mask won't filter.
R:  Could be, mhm.
L:  So I think you'd be- -- be better off praying and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kissing your rear goodbye --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when it happens.
R:  Well, we have, um -- there's a nuclear power plant, um -- well, it's, uh --
L:  Oh, so you've got several things going out --
R:  There's two right here in Char- -- you know, near Charlotte, um, but not -- I mean, not in my backyard it's probably twenty five miles from my house.  But they gave out those, um, iodine pills or some type of pills, I can't remember what --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know, they gave those out, um, I guess about two weeks ago.  But we didn't even get it -- I mean, 'cause you had to live within ten miles of the plant.  But, um, you know, that kind of made me fell ... you know, I d- -- it's --
L:  A little apprehensive.
R:  Yeah.  Ye-, uh, we'd -- I've just never ... um, I'm thirty nine and I've never been through something like -- you know, it just makes you -- I think about the kids coming up, you know, that they're -- they're living through this now and -- we've -- I've never ha- --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- you know, just never experienced it.  Um, you know, my mom was in -- you know, was around during World War Two and, um, I guess she's kinda had some experience with it, but it's just -- it's -- it's frightening, it really is, when you sit down and think about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And especially these terrorists that don't -- they don't -- life doesn't mean a thing to them.  So, uh --
L:  In fact, it is, uh -- it's weird when they interview 'em and they were just like, "Oh yeah, my brother gave it to me".
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Well, if you think that, you know, your brother was smart and he sent you out there to die and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was just like --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  "No my bro- -- taking care of me".
R:  Well, they just have a totally different outlook.  I mean, I don't -- life just doesn't mean a thing to 'em.
L:  I think that beep was our warning that th- -- our time is almost up.
R:  Oh, okay, well, um --
L:  Or else -- no, it may be that I've got another call; I'm not going to worry about it.  But, um, o- on the --
R:  What about the, um, the college?  The, you know, the bombing or whatever yesterday.
L:  You know, they're saying now that that was not terrorists; that it -- they just think it may have been someone that didn't wanna go to class or whatever.
R:  That's what I was thinking.  I -- I just don't think they would --
L:  Because it's, uh, right here, it's right at finals, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what a good disruption that would be.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.
R:  Somebody may -- you know, a student that's upset, maybe about a test or a final or something.  That's what I was --
L:  Yeah, I think it's just someone blowing off steam --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, just because it's Harvard doesn't mean -- they -- you know, I mean, they just -- it means that they might be a little bit smarter in pulling something.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, um ...
R:  But I do think --
L:  I just didn't -- I just didn't think it was, um, anything that, uh, traumatic or whatever.
R:  No.  Uh-uh.
L:  It -- it just didn't seem like they were making -- paying that much attention towards --
R:  Not really, uh-uh.  No.
L:  So, uh, I was just glad I wasn't th- -- but, uh ... [LIPSMACK] it's --
R:  But I do think we're probably going to be faced with it, you know, in the fut- -- you know, near future.
L:  Well, th- they had that, uh, uh boy -- um, what is it, um, uh, a gal that does prophesy or whatever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, she was saying that -- that she thought that they were going to do the nerve gas on the coast.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And then you got to thinking, "Well, how far are we from the coast and how long is it gonna last?"
R:  Mm.
L:  And -- but then you get to thinking, you know, "Gee, um ... it could be off the coast of Michigan".
R:  Right, right.
L:  So y- --
R:  Um, or California.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, um, a- and ho-, you know, how is that gonna -- I mean, you just can't stop living your life becau- -- you know, scared to go everywhere.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I agree with that.
R:  It's just -- you gotta be, you know, be careful and keep your eyes open and look for suspicious, you know, behavior or whatever but, I just --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, if y- -- if your neighbor next door is buying a lot of fertilizer -- [LAUGH]
R:  Right, we might want -- [LAUGH] and doesn't have a garden [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yes, and he --
R:  ... we might wanna --
L:  -- has a little tiny plot in the backyard and --
R:  Mhm.  Right.  We- --
L:  -- there's no way -- you know, I would probably go, "Mm, this guy is, uh, buying an awful lot of fertilizer, I think I'll call someone on that".
R:  Right.  Mhm.  That's right, but --
L:  But, you know, before I wouldn't even have thought of that.
R:  Me either, huh-uh.
L:  And, uh --
R:  But, you know, even with that -- remember with Oklahoma, when that happened.  I mean, and that was too --
L:  Oh, and we --
