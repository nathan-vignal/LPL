R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm good.  My name's Beth.
L:  And mine is Cheryl.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Yeah, and where are you from?
L:  Michigan, and you?
R:  Um, New Jersey.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Southern New Jersey, about an hour north of Atlantic City.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Twenty minutes out of Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How's your weather?
R:  It is raining.
L:  Is it?  Oh, Lord.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I hope it don't come this way.  Well, I guess our topic is smoking.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm not a smoker.  I used to, oh, about six, seven years ago, but when I become pregnant I got violently ill --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- one morning and I went to light up a cigarette, and that was all she wrote.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I've never smoked since.
R:  How many years ago was that?
L:  That's been, oh, boy ... sev- -- uh, six years ago.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Six years ago.
R:  Wow.
L:  Now, my h- -- my husband smokes, my mom smokes, everybody around me smokes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But there's no smoking in my house.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  Um, and my husband did that himself.  Uh, he had the signs all on the doors and everything before we, uh, brought our son home.  No smoking ...
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  ... 'cause it's -- it's bad.  And personally I like to be able to go to restaurants and -- and eat without having ... smelling the cigarette smoke too.
R:  Right.  I agree.  Mhm.
L:  And are you a smoker?
R:  No.  My husband and I have never smoked.  Um, so I -- I really appreciate it when people don't.  And, um, I'm glad when it's, you know, banned in a -- public restaurants and --
L:  Me too.  Oh.
R:  -- you know, in planes and, um, you know, all those places, so ...  I wor- -- I work --
L:  There's, uh --
R:  -- with a lot of smokers that --
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  -- that take breaks and they have to -- I work in a bank, so they always have to go all the way outside and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- take their little break, you know, and, uh --
L:  Well, I notice here at our local hospital they do too, and they seem to smoke right at the entrance door.
R:  Right -- right at the door.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  That made a lot of sense.  Can't smoke inside but you just stand right outside the door.
R:  Right.  Right, the people that go in and out have to, you know, contend with you.
L:  Right.
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.  But I do think it's a good idea, and I think -- I think it's appropriate just for their health.  I think they need --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to be more aware of -- that, "Oh, this is just a habit", um, you know, that everybody has to deal with, 'cause it does affect other people 'cause it goes into the air.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I just think that, you know, if they can't care about themselves sometimes, sometimes, you know, the people around you have to say, "Look, you know, you can't do this here" and, "You can't do that there", so maybe they would realize, "Well, maybe this is more of an annoying thing than it -- you know, that [MN] -- and I should just quit", you know, and that way it would make everybody happy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  You know, I can't, uh -- I don't go visit my mom, and it's sad.  It's -- it's really sad.  I talk to her over the phone daily, ten times a day but she's in a small apartment and it just reeks so bad that when I -- when I do go over there and I come out I feel like I'm a cigarette.
R:  Oh, so she smokes heavy, huh?
L:  Yeah -- oh, heavy isn't even the word for it.  Plus she's on oxygen.
R:  Oh, wow, you're kidding.
L:  Yeah.  No, no.
R:  I mean, I didn't think you were allowed to do that.
L:  [LAUGH] Not supposed to.
R:  Wow.
L:  'Cause you can blow up, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ach.
R:  She's in such a habit of it.
L:  Can't tell her nothing.
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, she's --
R:  The- -- well, they say it's very hard to quit, so it's not that I think, "Oh, it's so easy", that, "I think these people should just -- you know, I don't what's the matter with them".  I don't -- I -- you know, I realize it's hard but I think it's for their health and for those that are around them and that love them and [SIGH] ... you know, it's just -- I don't know.  I just don't think it's a -- a good th- thing.
L:  I do -- I do know one thing from being a past smoker, and to -- to not smoking, that I have a daughter that's thirteen now, and I smoked with her --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- while I was pregnant.  And she was around cigarette smoke and she had, oh, really bad ear infections, really, really bad.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yep.  Now ... and the first thing, you take 'em to a doctor.  "Are they around cigarette smoke?"  That's the number one cause of ear problems.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.  Mm.
L:  But -- oh, yes.  So now with my son, he hasn't had no ear problems at all.
R:  Well.
L:  Haven't had him around cigarette smoke, don't allow it.  Uh-uh.
R:  Right.
L:  M- my daughter's had --
R:  I didn't realize that.  I don't think I've ever -- and I -- mhm.
L:  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it's -- it's the child --
R:  I thought it would be more of a breathing --
L:  No.  Nope, it affects their ears too, really bad.
R:  Wow.
L:  I couldn't figure it out either but sh- -- I proved it to myself, you know, just between the two kids.  M- my daughter had problems and she was around the cigarette smoke.  I've kept my son away from it and he has had no problems.
R:  Mhm.  Well, that's interesting.
L:  So ...
R:  Now, you mean --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- uh, did she have tubes in her -- done in her ears, or ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, well, she had to get the whole --
L:  Tubes four different times.
R:  Wow.
L:  And then -- and that led into a- -- her tonsils and all -- oh, boy, we've been through it all.  She's even had major sinus surgery.
R:  Wow. [NOISE]
L:  So with my son I've kept him away from everything and so far so good.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, well, that's good.  Uh, do you -- does your daughter show any -- since she -- well, she said -- you -- she's thirteen?
L:  Mhm.
R:  She didn't show any sign of interest of smoking?  S- -- 'cause sometimes --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- kids start at that age, you know.
L:  No, she doesn't --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  And none of her friends that she associates with are like that either.
R:  That's good.
L:  So ...  I may have to face that later on down.
R:  Right, right, but right now ... yeah.  Well, if you just keep --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- encouraging her -- the, uh, the health benefits --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- of not doing it and, you know, being a girl and, you know, be- -- some day ge- -- eventually getting pregnant, you know, later in life and all that kind of thing, you know, it's really beneficial to not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's almost more of a nuisance.  You know, you're really not doing it for, you know, o- other people, it would just -- it's just a selfish kind of a habit really, you know. [SIGH] But, uh, that is -- that is an interesting topic and, um, I guess that they're slowly, uh, getting the public places all, uh, banned from smoking but there are still a few restaurants, they still ask you, you know, uh, "You want smoking or non?"  Now, I mean, let's face it, if you have a lot of smokers in there that day you know it's going to come over.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you're going to smell it eventually, you know, and sometimes my eyes get red and I can't -- I get a headache and -- depending on how much is in the room, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, most places have been pretty good about [SIGH] um, you know, people -- considering other people, you know, from having to smell the smoke.
L:  Don't --
R:  I also think the cigarettes companies haven't done -- you know, they -- I think, to me, that they've made it, um, a -- a -- a habit, you know, that you can't get off of it easy.  It's not just a fact of, "Oh, I smoke"; they make you addicted to it, so ...  I think they've created a lot of problems 'cause they want the money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Well --
L:  Oh, and the co- -- the price of cigarettes.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, see, because I'm close to Delaware, and there's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no tax in Delaware.  So people can buy a carton or a case I don't know which it is for half the price as it is here in New Jersey, 'cause our taxes are very high.  Um, like, it's fifteen dollars for a case and up here it's, like -- like thirty two or something.  And so they all go to D- -- whenever they go to Delaware they all -- they, "Oh, will you pick me up such and -- so many cases and -- or cartons or whatever of cigarettes?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they -- we have that option here.  You know.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, uh, if they want to save money, that's what they do.  I'm thinking, "You could save a lot of money and not" -- 'cause, like, with my Assistant Manager at work, she's -- between he- -- she and her husband they spend five thousand dollars a year when they're both smoking.  I mean, can you imagine what that could pay for?
L:  Oh, I --
R:  You know?
L:  I know.  My mom's always crying broke all the time but yet she can -- she can cough up over thirty dollars for a carton of cigarettes.
R:  Right.  That's what I mean, it --
L:  And mind you, there -- she probably smokes one carton a week, if not a little more.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's unreal.  I've seen her smoke two, three packs a day.
R:  That's incredible.
L:  And we've even -- went as far as to all of us chip in, buy the patches.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ...
R:  Right.
L:  We've done everything we can except put her in nursing homes where she can't get 'em, you know what I mean?
R:  Right, right, right.  Now, uh, would she -- she just not wear the patch or ...
L:  Oh, [SIGH] --
R:  ... it just didn't do her any good?
L:  She just don't -- yeah, right.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  I don't think she's got any willpower.
R:  Yeah, I see, yeah.  She probably figures, "Now I've lived this long, well, it -- it won't hurt me in any -- can't hurt me any more than it already has".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  I guess -- ah, yeah, I guess you eventually get to that attitude, you know, where you just need it so bad you just can't quit and it's -- it's too much trouble to quit.  I kn- -- I know a lot of people say that and I -- I had a -- [MN] one of my girls at work, she just had a ba- -- she had a baby but she didn't -- she could -- she didn't smoke the whole time she was pregnant but as soon as she was done, she -- when she was -- she's never smoked in her house, she goes out into her garage.  But I'm thinking, "But you're still showing him that you smoke.  You're -- he's still, like, there, you know".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "A- and, you know, so you're still" -- she's like, "It's just not worth it for me.  I've lived this long smoking and I'm, like, oh ..."
L:  She sounds like my mom. [LAUGH]
R:  That -- it's so interesting, though.  I don't, you know ... I don't -- I don't understand that thought.  But I've never been a smoker, I've never had that, so really don't, like, understand, you know, what it really does take t- t- to stop.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I really don't.  So I -- I don't appreciate that, uh, part about it but -- and I -- they say, "It's so hard, you can't even imagine", you know.  I said, "Well, you quit the whole nine months you were pregnant.  I can't believe [LAUGH] you can't quit".
L:  Right.
R:  "Think of the same reasons, you know, you still have kids."
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Think of the same reasons.  Just 'cause they're not inside you, it doesn't mean they're not, you know, eventually, you know, smelling the smoke, you know.  They go to the garage to get their bike".  But ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  I, ach --
R:  -- it's interesting.
L:  -- I totally av- -- I try to avoid it.
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, that's good though.  I mean, you, uh, you were able to -- to quit it and stay off of it and ... I -- I'm sure you'll live longer because of it.
L:  God, I hope so.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I already -- I already deal with the weight issue.
R:  Uh-huh.
