R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Sarah.
L:  My name is Jennifer.
R:  Hi, Jennifer.  How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  Good.  Ah, smoking.  So they were -- she -- she said something about smoking in public places, yes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, um, do you want me to start?
L:  Yeah, go ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Now, u- um, I guess I was just gonna talk about, um, I know that in New York they have no smoking in public places and I'm actually a social smoker, so I smoke once in a while, but, um, I know the, um, I'm kind of happy that they don't do it out here, that you can't smoke in public places, in, you know, um, bars and stuff out here, because I go out, you know, dancing and when you're on the dance floor, you don't want cigarettes around and, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't -- I don't know, I know when I go -- when I've gone home in New York before, they passed the, um, [MN] the no smoking in public places.  I was always annoyed, because you walk out of places and your clothes smell awful. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I agree. [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, and even other smokers, like I just -- it's -- it's weird though, because I think that smokers should have some rights, but [SIGH] I think that it -- definitely it's better that they can't smoke inside.
L:  Yes, I do too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like to go out in public places too, but I've had, uh, some health problems, so I'm not supposed to around cigarette smoke, so it makes it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it makes it real hard --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- uh, when you're, you know, wanting to go, like, to the bowling alley and the people in the lane beside of you are bowling --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, are smoking and -- and, uh, so we do have -- I -- I live near Chattanooga, Tennessee --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and we do have, like, one bowling alley that does not allow smoking down by the lanes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if you wanna smoke you have to go somewhere else.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh, but --
R:  Bowling alleys are the worst.  I remember, like --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- back in New York, my parents used to bowl in the Sunday league and they would just come home and just reek and they don't smoke or anything, but it's just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's so awful.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, where do you live?
R:  Um, I'm actually in LA.
L:  Oh.
R:  I grew up in upstate New York though, so I go --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- back there sometimes.  Um --
L:  Oh, I grew up in Ohio.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh. [MN]
R:  Um, yeah, and I know that it's, you know, oh, it's -- it's -- ca- -- is there smoking there in Tennessee in public places or --
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they don't have that law.
R:  Yeah, I know that in LA when it happened, I mean, there was a bit of an uprise, but it's actually gone over pretty well, and a good thing out here, though, is that you can basically be outside most of the year --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- so it's not as bad, you know what I mean?  And I think that, you know, most bars and stuff try to have patios and stuff like that.
L:  We're starting to make more patios here in -- you know, in Chattanooga.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, a lot of the new restaurants, that's the thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because actually, in Chattanooga, you could probably sit out, ah --
R:  Most of the year.
L:  -- probably at least eight months out of the year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, so, because there's --
R:  What are your temperatures like right now?
L:  It's in the seventies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, rainy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh --
R:  Do you guys get s- -- you don't get snow really much, no?
L:  No, I've lived here seven years and I've seen it maybe once or twice.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So, I actually live in North Georgia, but it's, like, five minutes to Chattanooga.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I work in Chattanooga and I -- but I live in North Georgia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, uh, we bear it.  But once in a while, they'll see a little bit more snow in Chattanooga, like five minutes away, 'cause I live in a valley.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and I -- and I don't get the snow like they do over more in Chattanooga than I get here.
R:  Huh.
L:  So --
R:  That's interesting.
L:  But, uh, anyways, uh, yeah, our building that I work in, it's a non smoking building.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they don't, uh, nobody, you know, in the office smokes or anybody in any of the other offices smoke --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everybody has to go outside.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's amazing though, I'm taking, uh, some medical classes, how many of the students smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  In the medical field, even the teacher --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smokes, so it's -- it's amazing, you know?
R:  Yeah, it's funny.  I work in, um, television, you know, I'm out in Hollywood and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I work in television and so many people in this industry smoke, and like I said, like I'm a social smoker, but I've always kept the rule that I won't smoke during the day, because people in production, like, go out and have their breaks all day long --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'd be smoking all day and I -- it's not a good habit. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Not at all.
L:  Well, it's nice that you can control it, because I know [LAUGH] a lot of people can't. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no, it's like -- it's one of those things that it's kind of a -- a -- when I get stressed or when I've had a few drinks, I do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I shouldn't be, and I always talk about not doing it anymore, but I've never had a problem where I have to, have to, have to have a cigarette, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of -- but I think it's more -- it's a little bit of a psychological addiction but, um, it's something I can pretty much control and --
L:  Mhm.  What was the other question she said we should be talking about?
R:  I think it was something about, um, was it something about public messages about not smoking or --
L:  Oh, yeah, whether the -- maybe the ads on TV or something?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, I mean, those always get to me.  I always, like, get wigged out by, like, smoking and drug commercials because I just -- I don't know, I just don't [SIGH] -- I don't feel -- I feel like it's more of a s- scare tactic than a fact tactic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and it just -- I don't know.
L:  I know, I -- down here, they're really putting big posters up, uh, billboards and stuff, but it's all directed to teens --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, trying to stop, because there's a lot of t- -- [MN] teenagers here that smoke, I mean, everywhere you go, see -- you -- and when you drive by the schools, you know, you see all the kids when they pull out -- lighting up their cigarettes --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and hanging their arms out the window to show their friends that they've got a cigarette in their hand, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's really bad here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that -- that's what most of the billboards and stuff -- I don't [MN] see that many commercials on TV, but there is billboards everywhere.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And making little snide remarks of, you know, all about, you know, "Do you stink?" or, [LAUGH] you know, whatever --"
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- you know, it's just stuff like that.  So they've --
R:  Yeah.  Do you think they're, uh, they're pro- -- you don't feel like they're effective then?  I mean, you don't see that they're effective, kind of?
L:  Well, I -- really, they've just started more and more the last couple a years --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, uh, so I don't know that they're really working --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with so many adults that smoke and they let your kids --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, smoke and they buy their cigarettes for 'em here and it's just --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that just amazes me.
R:  I know, it's really scary.  I -- my parents, to this day, don't know that I smoke a little.  I'm, like, I think it's a horrible thing and, like, I know that they would be, like, I shouldn't do it and I'm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like --
L:  Well, I've had cancer, so --
R:  -- I wouldn't do it, I would feel, like, weird smoking in front of them.   I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have -- have you ever -- it's weird, because I won't even, like, when I am working, um, I -- I won't even smoke, like, in front of my bosses.  I have this whole big -- I guess it's a guilt thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] About smoking in front of grown ups, but I don't think that kids have that today at all.
L:  I -- I don't think so, because the parents down here, it just amazes me that they buy their -- the kids cigarettes and just -- just turn their heads like it's okay and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it -- it just --
R:  But I -- I think, like, the whole, like, taxes on cigarettes is a great thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it kind of -- I mean, it -- that even discourages me, 'cause I'm like, I don't wanna spend five bucks on cigarettes 'cause -- on something that's killing me, you know?  And I'm not, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not literally one's killing me, but you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to do it all the time.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  It's such an expensive habit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it is amazing to see, like, all these kids spending all their money on it.
L:  And I -- I really think it's -- well, the cigarettes are cheaper here.
R:  Oh, how much is a -- but you don't know how much one is there?
L:  I think they're, like, three something.
R:  Oh, really?  Wow, that's cheap.  Here, I think it's -- last time I bought a pack, like a month ago was, like, [MN] just under five dollars.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think I saw 'em, like, three fifty or something or other.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, so they're cheaper here 'cause, you know, they grow tobacco and stuff, you know, so --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- I guess it's -- it's cheaper here, and I think everything's cheaper here than it is in LA anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, probably quite a bit.
L:  But -- but, uh --
R:  But do they have, like, special -- do they have a lot of cigarette taxes or -- you don't know really?
L:  Yeah.  Not -- not in Georgia.
R:  No.
L:  See -- see, we don't have hardly any taxes on cigarettes or gasoline and stuff like that.  It's a lot cheaper in Georgia.
R:  How much are you paying for gas right now, out of curiosity?
L:  A dollar twenty four.
R:  Wow.  Yeah, ours is slowly going down.  I just passed a sign, it's a dollar seventy.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I was paying over two dollars for a really long time.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And that was, like, I live around the corner from one of the cheapest places in town.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  That's crazy.
L:  But that's why I think, you know, they're trying to raise the taxes, I think, more on cigarettes so that the kids can't afford them.
R:  Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  I'm all --
L:  Pay off -- pay some of the schools --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pay, you know, up -- improve the schools with the money they're getting from the kids that are [LAUGH] -- that are doing it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  In fact, uh, my -- both my parents smoked and my Dad died of lung cancer, so I just stay away. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You never did it.
L:  And so -- no, and then I've had cancer, so I, um --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  -- I just don't, uh, I just -- oh, they're t- -- they're just showing on the Entertainment Tonight, Nicole Kid- -- Coleman, or Nicole, uh, oh, the one that was married to Tom Cruise, smoking a cigarette on TV. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I'm so -- I'm shocked.
R:  How funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not something you see anymore though, very much.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I saw it the other night and I'm, like, "Wow, I haven't seen anybody smoking a cigarette on TV in -- forever".
L:  I know, it's the way they showed her and -- and they act like it was some shock thing too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Wow, that's wild.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How long have we been talking?  I haven't even been paying attention.
L:  Uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- about nine minutes.
R:  Oh.
L:  We probably got about one more minute.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  'Cause I think it was seven twenty three and it's seven thirty two --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so we -- we got about one more minute.
R:  Chattering away.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  I'm trying to think if I've had --
