R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  How you doing?
L:  Pretty good.  You?
R:  All right.  My name is Jean Sweeney[?].  How you doing?
L:  I'm a -- it's bright and early but I'm awake.
R:  [LAUGH] What time is it there?
L:  It is [SIGH] about eight o'clock --
R:  Eight o'clock, okay I --
L:  -- and I've been up f- for an hour.
R:  [LAUGH] I got nine o'clock --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- so I'm on central time.  [several inaudible words] --
L:  Lucky.  Lucky. [SIGH]
R:  Wh- whe- where do you live?
L:  Wisconsin. [LAUGH]
R:  Wisconsin.  Okay, I live in, ah, Washington DC.
L:  [NOISE] Oh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my mom was consulting there for awhile.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, I guess the topic for today is smoking.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I heard hobbies, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Mine -- mine says smoking. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I do a number of things. [SIGH]
R:  Okay, do you smoke?
L:  I do not.
R:  Okay.  Have you ever smoked?
L:  I tried it, ah, once when I was about twelve and it knocked me on my ass and I thought, "Never again".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Thanks.
R:  I'm a nonsmoker, I do not like smoke --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  -- I've tried it one time and coughed the whole time [several inaudible words] --
L:  Pretty much --
R:  -- "This is not for me". [LAUGH] So the- --
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know, I thought, "Why not try it --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- it's not the end of the world if I try it?" --
R:  Thank you.
L:  Oh, it was the end of the world.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It felt like it by the time I got finished coughing --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- it really did.  Well, my issue's about smoking being banned in a restaurant, because they wanted to know about smoking being banned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and in restaurants.  My opinion is fine, I mean, I feel that if they can do work free environment non smoking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I feel they didn't do the same thing in the restaurants.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  If you must smoke, go outside.  I mean, hey, I don't --
L:  There's nothing wrong with standing outside.
R:  Right.  I mean, they do it in the workplace, they've gotten used to it, everything is fine.  Hey, do the same thing in your, um -- in the, ah -- in the restaurant, because that -- to me, nothing annoys me more than --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm stand- -- sitting down --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm -- start up -- because I started coughing real bad when I, ah, smell smoke --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from, ah -- a cigarette.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, it doesn't do me any good at all to have smokers around me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, hey, I'm all for it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think [SIGH] -- I think what they -- they really shouldn't argue about it.  I mean, a they're killing themselves.
R:  Right.
L:  They have no right to be killing me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've decided that I'm not killing myself early.
R:  Thank you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yet they think I should still be subjected [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to their killing themselves and now me. [SIGH]
R:  Right.  I agree.
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  And I look at smoking as a slow death.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  A slow way of killing yourself over the years.  I mean, what the -- what's the -- the thing that everybody wants to do is -- is keep [several inaudible words] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  For me, smoking is just a slow death.  You -- you're constantly giving yourself lung cancer --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and you could possibly give the second hand smokers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lung cancer too.
L:  Quite.
R:  Because if I have to inhale --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what you're smoking, then you're --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- subjected me to the same thing you're going through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I do not want to be subjected to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any of that stuff and I'm trying to keep my life, I aint trying to end it. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, seriously.  I think that all the cigarette companies should pay us to kill ourselves, we shouldn't have to pay them.
R:  Thank you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because ar- aren't technology --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- trying to improve ways of keeping us young?  And if we're going to be -- you know, if they're going to come -- try to come up with ways to keep us young --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and keep us from dying, well, in turn, that's what you'd -- you'd do in the same -- you're doing the opposite when you smoke --
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.
R:  -- and to do -- and to do that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think is just totally ridiculous.  How you're going to sit up there and just continuously smoke.  But like you say, to me, they got -- they -- they did away with it in the workplace, yeah they beefed about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but hey, do they not now -- I don't care how cold it is --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if they want to smoke, they'll come out the building and they smoke --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and I think it should be done same in the restaurant and [several inaudible words] their biggest thing is a reference to in the bars -- when they're in the bars.  Well, you know, you get over it. [LAUGH]
L:  Pretty much.
R:  You will get over that kind of thing because you know what, if they -- if -- because to me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the biggest [several inaudible words] to me if they did it in the workplace, because I would have thought that if anything, they would have had a place for them to go.  But when they said, "Go outside" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  and they -- or you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they a- are here today, I'm saying, "Hey.  Then we're on a roll". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, and they've stopped rejecting choice there- --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there's quite of few of them actually who are trying to quit now, quote unquote.
R:  Right.
L:  Trying.  Um and good for them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but the- there's the people who are like sixty and they have emphysema and they're suing the tobacco companies.
R:  Thank you.  Now, did the tobacco company --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really tell them to put that [inaudible] in their mouth?
L:  Sure didn't.
R:  Thank you. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry James Dean did, but ah [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't want -- I don't -- you have brains people, use them --
R:  Thank you.
L:  -- please. [SIGH]
R:  Thank you.  That's what I'm saying and one of the questions that they ask about -- um, they had asked --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for us to talk about was, um, do you think that the billboards [several inaudible words] advertisement for, do you think they're doing a good job and putting the word out for not smoking?  What's your opinion on that?
L:  Not particularly.  Um, I see th- the large size general surgeon warnings --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and, ah, I don't think that deters anybody really, um --
R:  Uh-huh.  I don't think it does either.  I really don't.  I think unless you come up with a clever ad to deter people where they actually can s- -- you know, will -- you know, or gets them to just look at them billboards [several inaudible words] but aren't -- but what they're coming out with now, I don't see it working.
L:  It's not and, you know, the sad thing is is that they still have needs.  Like I joined a group --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Tobacco Free Camping For -- For America's Kids.
R:  Right.
L:  It's so sad that we need this.
R:  Thank you.
L:  They're obviously not doing their job if -- if people who have nothing better to do with their lives, like myself, sit online --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and send the senator stuff or, you know, mail them or whatever about [SIGH] crap they should be doing.  Because the government's not doing anything it should be either.
R:  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  Well, did you see that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- commercial that came on television where it said -- you -- did you said the dog smoking?
L:  I did not, no.
R:  Yeah, there's a commercial on television and the dog, believe it or not, got a cigarette in his mouth and he started puffing on the cigarette --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and he said, "I know my e- -- I know my excuse --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- what's yours?" --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know?  And I will say that -- that's the only thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I saw --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was a catchy thing saying, you know, "I know what I'm about to do to my life, what you going to do with your life?", you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, other than that I've not seen anything about it.  You know, I've seen some of the commercials where the man standing there and the people come in and ask him --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for a cigarette and he says, "Don't you know --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I'm eighteen -- shouldn't smoke and everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I'm not seeing that one anymore since those -- those, ah, commercials [inaudible] --
L:  No, I'm actually seeing more anti pot smoking commercials.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Which isn't a bad thing but --
R:  I agree.  I agree.
L:  -- because that's got to go too.
R:  Yep, thank you. [LAUGH]
L:  They have one in particular in Wisconsin where they have like -- I don't know, she's like thirteen -- my guess fourteen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I guess, ah, you see her -- her mom was looking at a -- ah, a pregnancy test -- a home pregnancy test --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they're watching it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, her husband is standing outside the door [NOISE] and she kind of summonsed him to come in [SIGH] and she nods, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- saying, "Yes, it's -- it's positive" and then [NOISE] you look over and, ah, you see the daughter and the words on the screen say, "You're now the youngest grandparents in town" or something like that.
R:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm like, "Oh, but she had a choice".
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, that's what I'm saying.  But you know what, to me, television didn't -- t- television is what to me did a lot of the damage too, because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in earliest days when you had Hugh Hefner and all of those people that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- used to smoke and they thought that was the thing, to have a cigarette in their, ah, mouth and, you know, talking.  And I remember the Twilight Zone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know how y- -- old you are, but all of those things where they used to, you know, just be puffing on a cigarette --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I guess people came to the point where, "Hey, if the stars can do it.  Hey, it must be cool" but --
L:  And, "It's not going to hurt me".
R:  Thank you.  And, you know -- and -- and believe it or not, the same way -- the same way the television, you know, introduced it, that's the way, I tell you, they should be trying to get rid of it and let people know that, "Hey, we used to do this --"
L:  What? [NOISE]
R:  -- but now hey this ain't no neat -- this aint no [inaudible] no more.  I'm serious".  So --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- that's my -- you know, my views on that, because um -- like
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- smoking ain't no joke. [LAUGH] It really isn't a joke. --
L:  Sure isn't.  My mom used to when I was younger --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah -- um, it just -- I remember being five and I couldn't even stay in the same room with her --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it bothered me that much.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And eventually she quit.  She's been quit for about fifteen years now --
R:  Oh, good.  Good.
L:  -- which was kind of her [NOISE], but [SIGH] the fact that she smoked at all [NOISE] to begin with --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- was really not too cool.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  Well, have you been around people that -- have your friends or anybody that has smoked and you [several inaudible words], "I can't take this?"? [LAUGH]
L:  I do have friends that smoke --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they -- for the most part they don't smoke near me, they don't smoke in my house --
R:  Good.
L:  -- they don't smoke in my car.  I have rules.
R:  And the same here.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Same here, I'm telling you.
L:  And if they don't like em, that's too bad.
R:  That- -- that's what I say too.  I said -- you know, people that smoke, I say, "You know what, if you're my friend you're my friend, but I'm --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- going to tell you right now, when it comes to rules in my house and place --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't want to die from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- inhaling smoke that I don't need and die from, so therefore" --
L:  [several inaudible words] paid for.
R:  Ah?  Huh?
L:  You haven't paid for it, have you? [LAUGH]
R:  Thank you.  And I'm like, "You know and -- and -- and all essence, you know, I love you but I don't love what you do".
L:  Right.
R:  I really don't, you know?  I [inaudible] --
L:  Love the sinner and not the sin.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] It's [inaudible] -- you know, it's just when they
