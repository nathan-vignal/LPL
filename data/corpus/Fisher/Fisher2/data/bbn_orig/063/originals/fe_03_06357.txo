L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Carol.
L:  Hi, this Dina. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  Um --
L:  So --
R:  -- w- -- I could not hear the recording that well.  Was it -- the topic was --
L:  It was talking about smoking.
R:  It -- the ban on smoking?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Well, as an asthmatic --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I have to say I'm very much in favor of them, although I can understand why, uh, people are not always that happy to see them be enacted.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought we got disconnected.
L:  Yeah, that's what I thought.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, yeah, well, you know, my grandmother has asthma and emphysema mixed together --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- from smoking, so, uh, I'm totally, like, against it.
R:  You're a non smoker too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I, uh, my boyfriend actually is a smoker and [MN] I -- I feel sorry for him sometimes when, you know, if we get a table in a non smoking restaurant and you can see the nicotine fit starting to set in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but at the same time I know I could very well probably not stay there if we got a -- a table in the smoking section --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess I also kind of feel like it's -- it's for his own good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though he's -- I mean, he's a grown man, he can make his own decisions --
L:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I -- I know he wants to quit, but wanting to and being able to are two different things.  I -- and I feel like every little bit of encouragement to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to help him stop can -- i- it can only be a good thing, even though it may not be that effective.
L:  Right, right.  Well ... yeah, I mean, like I don't, uh, [MN] I don't even know, like, why they even permit it, like in nightclubs and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, because it's really -- even the secondhand smoke can get you.
R:  Oh, yeah, it's just as bad.
L:  And I would be really angry if I had a problem with my lungs and I didn't ever even smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, m- my doctor told me that's exactly why I developed asthma.  I was twenty five when they diagnosed me --
L: Mhm.
R:  -- and both of my parents were chain smokers when I was growing up.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I mean, I've never smoked in my life, I try and take good care of myself, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it -- it gets you, it's not -- it's not good for you at all.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but what can you do?
L:  [MN] They wa- -- they was trying to -- I think the recording also said, like, about, um, if -- if they could get, like, a smoking prevention program going, how would, you know -- I think I would be for that.
R:  Like the public service announcements, that kind of thing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- see, I -- I'm in favor of them.  Again, I -- I don't know how effective they are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just 'cause I've seen so many people who, you know, they're smokers and they may not like the fact that they're smoking, they may wanna quit.  I -- I've seen so many people who've tried every single method you can think of, and they're just -- they're so hooked on it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I d- -- [SIGH] and I -- they can't do any harm to have those programs in place, but again, I just don't know how e- effective it is 'cause --
L:  Right.
R:  -- telling somebody, "You shouldn't smoke, it's bad for you" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they know that, everybody knows it's not good for you, unless you're fourteen and you don't think --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anything's bad for you.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And -- and -- and they're not going to listen to the ads anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  By the time somebody is thirty and, you know, coherent and intelligent enough to actually listen to the messages, I -- they're, you know, either they're not ever going to smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or they're already hooked.  So, I mean --
L:  True.
R:  -- I don't know.  I -- I guess I have sort of mixed feelings about that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What happened?  Hello?
R:  Uh, no, I -- we -- we -- we have a bad connection.  I don't know what's --
L:  Yeah, it's weird.
R:  -- what the problem is here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Um, do you have people in your family who smoke, or a friend?
L:  Uh, I got some, um, relatives.  I have a -- actually, I have a -- a aunty that lives in Chicag- -- you know, Chicago, that's where I'm from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, she -- she's on oxygen and she still smokes.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  And I'm, like, that's serious.  I'm, like, "Aunty, you're going to blow yourself up".
R:  Yeah, that's even more dangerous.
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Oh, that's a shame.  But, see, that's how much it -- it hooks you.  It -- she's older, I assume?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  And my -- my grandfather was the same, well, he, uh, he actually -- he smoked, like, four packs a day from the time he was fourteen until he was seventy five, and they diagnosed him with lung cancer.
L:  Wow.
R:  And -- and at that point, he was scared enough that he could stop.  He stopped cold turkey.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, I mean, at that point [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.  He --
R:  -- the -- the damage was done, you know?
L:  It's [LAUGH] -- right. [LAUGH]
R:  There was -- [NOISE] the doctors told him, "There's just nothing we can do for you.  It's a matter of time".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, a- and, actually, and interestingly enough, my uncle had quit smoking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the stress after my grandfather died, he actually started again. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Which -- which blew my mind, but [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- and they say it's as addictive as heroin.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know?
L:  [MN]
R:  Like, chemically addictive.
L:  Mm. [SIGH]
R:  So, I mean, it's -- it's not like going on a --
L:  I don't -- I don't -- I don't --
R:  -- diet, where if you have willpower --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can get off it, it's --
L:  I don't even see why people wanna smoke, I mean, it's just so -- you know?
R:  Well, I th- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, you know, when you're seventeen --
L:  I don't see anything glamorous about it.  I don't even like to smell it.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, I think for most adults that's the case, but like I said, people I know, like I don't anybody who was over twenty when they started smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, when you're seventeen and dumb and you're thinking, "Well, nothing can hurt me".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And think, well, you know, "I'll put up with the smell, 'cause I look cool" and --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that -- kids don't know any better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I said, they're not listening to the ads that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- say it's bad for you.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  It's a shame.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's crazy, isn't it?  I would never do it though, because I can't imagine, like my grandmother just cannot catch her breath.
R:  Was she a smoker?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  Or when I was a little girl she was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I could just imagine how hard it is, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for her.
R:  Yeah, it just -- it gets its hooks in you and -- and there is very little you can do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Except my -- my father is, uh, he's been smoking since he was a teenager, and he has literally tried everything.  He's done the hypnosis, he's done the patch, he's gone cold turkey more times than I can count --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I don't think he's ever gone more than three days before he finally broke down.
L:  Wow.
R:  It's just, you know, it's a shame.  And -- and he's at a point where he's such a chain smoker that he can't even go to a movie --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because he can't sit still for two hours without it, and by the time he's left to, you know, have his nicotine fix --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- comes back into the theater, he's missed half the movie.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But, uh, I mean, yeah, it's --
L:  Yeah, I know, like my co workers have -- have to have a smoke break like every thirty minutes, or every o- other hour or something.
R:  Oh, yeah, mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Are you there?
L:  Y- yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's very strange. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what that is.
L:  I know.
R:  They must be having some kind of technical glitch, 'cause I -- I could just barely hear any of the message.  I -- all I got was something about smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  So --
R:  What was there -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Yeah, so I was going to say, like, um, yeah, I would never even try to smoke, ever.
R:  Yeah, I [MN] -- I don't understand the appeal.  I know when [MN] -- when I was a kid, it did not seem -- I knew --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people who started smoking 'cause they thought it was cool, but I guess [MN] from my perspective, seeing my parents wake up in the morning and hack up a lung before they could even get out of bed --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and knowing that, like, our house, no matter how clean we kept it, always smelled like smoke.
L:  Wow.
R:  Except for -- like sometimes in the summer, when you could keep all the windows open all the time, but in the winter, everything smelled of smoke, 'cause the house was all shut up, and all they did was smoke in there all day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I don't know why anybody would want to do this.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- yeah, I -- I -- I'm kinda of with you on that point, I just don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I don't see the appeal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, like I said, when you're sixteen you're not necessarily making the smartest decisions.
L:  A- and they're -- a- and they're trying everything, like trying to raise the -- you know, the prices for the cigarettes and people are just buying it by the box.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, if you're hooked on something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're -- you're gonna -- you're gonna pay for it.  It doesn't matter, they can raise it -- the price to twenty bucks a pack --
L:  They're gonna buy it.
R:  -- people are still gonna need -- they're gonna have that, you know, that need, that fix that they have to get.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a shame.  I mean, i- if they raise the price of cocaine, people are gonna say, "Oh, well, I'll stop using cocaine now"?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it -- it -- it just doesn't work that way.  I think the only --
L:  Mm, it's just -- just like food to them, you know what I'm saying?
R:  E- e- exactly.
L:  It's just like --
R:  Exactly.  I think the only hope with stuff like raising prices is if you make it harder for teenagers to get it, hopefully fewer people will start smoking.
L:  Oh, right, right.
R:  And then, you know, maybe over time, but, yeah, it's not going to have any effect in the short term.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just -- the only way to -- to cut -- you know, to reduce the number of people smoking is just don't have 'em start in the first place.  I- it's so hard to quit.  I've seen so many --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people try.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's just a shame.
L:  I can imagine. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, why don't --
L:  I can imagine.
R:  You know, I don't -- I don't know if you've ever had to diet or anything, like it -- it takes a lot of willpower just to do that, and that's not --
L:  Diet.
R:  -- an addiction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that's just -- that is just willpower.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But, yeah, if you're physically hooked on a drug, even a legal drug --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- i- i- it's willpower, and it's a lot more.  You have to be lucky, you have to have a support system in place and everything else.
L:  Yeah, you know --
R:  It's --
L:  -- my mother used to smoke real bad.  She used to have to go out in the middle of night and get cigarettes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  M- -- and, uh, she actually got baptized, uh, and when she came up from the water, she didn't smoke anymore.
R:  Are you kidding?
L:  God blessed her.  Yeah, I'm s- -- I am --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so serious, yeah.  She -- she -- she never picked up another cigarette.
R:  But did she have that in her mind though, that this was a goal she had for herself?
L:  Uh, I don't know, because when I was -- see, I was real little when she did it --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but she just told me, you -- m- m- m- -- no, her -- she -- she just lost the desire when she came up.
