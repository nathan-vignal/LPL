R:  Hi, I'm Wendy.
L:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Shaun[?].
R:  Hi.  Um, so the topic is, um, about smoking in public places and whether you think a ban would be a good idea.
L:  Right and what do you think the, ah, anti smoking ads and stuff on TV.  Um, so, do you want to go first or ...?
R:  No, you g- -- go ahead.
L:  Okay.  Um, so, I personally, because I don't smoke, I think it's a good idea to ban smoking in public places, because I -- I really don't want to deal with second hand smoking.  Um, and I think it makes it a better place for me to go to, some place that does ban smoking, so.
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree.  I, um -- ah, I have four kids and, ah, they're all really sensitive to smoke and it's -- it's -- even when it is banned in public places, walking out and getting hit with a lot of cigarette smoke, even when it's outside, is really unpleasant.  We -- you know, none of us like it but the -- the question -- the -- that I don't, um, have any clarity on is if we took away the option to smoke, would it produce a violent reaction from smokers.
L:  Huh, well, are -- are you -- where are you actually right now [several inaudible words]?
R:  We're in LA.
L:  You're in LA.  I'm in Boston right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'm actually a college student in Boston --
R:  Oh, where do you go?
L:  -- so -- I go to MIT.
R:  Uh-huh.  I went to BU. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Wow, that's right across the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right across the river.  Um, so actually in Boston right now there is a -- they just enacted this ban in -- in a lot of the public places, like bars and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They recently prohibited smoking there.  Um, I know that in New York they've done it for like -- since -- since like -- for at least a couple of months.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, as far as the -- I watch like -- I haven't really heard that much about it.  Like you've mentioned like people can still smoke outside the place --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so they just step out for a smoke and it's still annoying to that extent, so I -- I mean, people have not been allowed to smoke in like offices for awhile, right?
R:  Right.
L:  So, people -- you can't exactly protest that, so I think they should have to deal with that, I don't know.
R:  It's -- it's difficult because in terms of, um, wh- what I would like to see happen is if people feel that they have a problem with smoking maybe the smoking prevention programs would really help.  The people who choose to smoke they're -- not that this ever really happens, but to have an awareness that there are l- -- other people around that, you know, maybe they shouldn't smoke in -- and, um, not just where it's banned, but just public areas.  But it's -- you know, it -- it -- then they are kind of smoking just only in their own homes.
L:  Mm.  Do you think that the public banning might tie in with, ah, the anti smoking ads or initiatives and --
R:  I --
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  I think it could be a cooperative venture but you know it -- there are people who smoke who don't want to smoke.  It's -- it's an addiction, it's not that necessarily they're enjoying smoking or they would like to quit and maybe if money was put into -- you know, more money was put into those programs, it could help those people.  It wouldn't help people who want to continue to smoke.
L:  Mm.  I guess I can agree that like if you're thinking of quitting but you -- it's really hard for you, like if you know that if you go to bar or something you can't smoke, then there will be less temptation to maybe.
R:  Right.  Right.  I think that's a good point.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, if you're a s- -- and I know that, um, with my kids and, ah, it -- the school that they go to, there are very few smokers and so it's really unusual to meet someone that smokes, so consequently there are kids that try smoking but they are definitely in the minority in the high school.  It -- it's not like, because so and so smokes, all these other kids are going to smoke.  They don't see it that often and they make a choice not to smoke.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like -- actually in college -- at MIT there's not that many people that smoke.  I would say very few.  I only see it every --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now and then, um --
R:  Right.  I think it's so unusual.  I mean -- I mean -- I'm in LA and -- and it's -- it -- mo- -- the people that I'm around or the restaurants that I frequent are, kind of, health oriented and so you don't have a lot of smokers.  But the other thing is in LA there is, um, a big presence of the movie industry and if it looks cool in the movies or the upscale restaurants cater to smokers, um, they've -- they've been enlarging patios and making them, kind of, the cool places, then you would see an increase because the industry is -- is such a -- a big influence in LA.
L:  Oh, so you -- you're saying that the movie industry promotes smoking?
R:  If -- if they pr- -- well, there was this article in the LA Times saying that in restaurants currently being built -- the upscale restaurants in Hollywood and Beverly Hills in -- in LA there's a lot of money being put into patios to cater to the smokers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and -- and so then if you -- if you have, you know, celebrities that are seen on the patio smoking and they're considered a cool person and the patios are considered cool places to hang out, then you have these other people who want to be -- the whole article was about how even people who don't smoke want to be in -- on, um, these patios to be in this cool environment.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I think that's kind of odd, you know, because um, lung disease and cancer and dying is not very cool, you know?  It's --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  You know, it's not romantic, it's not pretty.
L:  But I guess in a sense -- like Hollywood is always portrayed smoking as kind of a cool thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in terms of like cowboy or whatever, so.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, there was, um, a really great commercial on -- an anti smoking commercial a couple of years ago with the Marlborough man --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who was dying of cancer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the brother was talking about it.  He was doing the voice -- voice over on it and you saw the picture of Marlb- Marlborough man and what he looked like in his youth and then you saw in a ho- -- um, in a hospital bed with the oxygen and everyth- -- and he was dying and he looked terrible and it was -- it was like -- I don't -- you're probably too young for this, but Yul Brynner also did these commercials and that was very powerful to see, "Oh, that's what smoking does".
L:  Mm.  I think like young people -- like I think most people know that smoking is bad.  Like I know people who smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my cousin, like, smokes, they know it's bad but like somehow they -- and it might be they're just in nicotine addiction but they -- they just like, "Oh, you know.  Ah, it won't [several inaudible words] I'll stop like in a few years and everything will be okay".  So, I don't how to -- you know, like how to get through to them that, like, it's not worth it.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's -- well, like I said in -- um, if you have a whole bunch of people saying that it is a cool thing like in the movies or in the industry or look at all the money -- what I was just saying about the patio --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so much money is being put into creating a smoke spot, you know, for -- for these people then it -- it's considered a cool thing.  It's not considered a sickness.  It's not considered an addiction.  It's considered a cool thing and, you know, that's what the cigarette companies want --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is that image.
L:  Right.  It's kind of --
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  Go ahead.
R:  No, I was just gong to say, it seems to me that the cigarette companies should be the ones paying for the ventilation systems and whatever would be helpful in these public places so that the people that don't smoke don't have to inhale the smoke.
L:  Hm.  Yeah.  And somehow -- it's like -- that the way they survive -- the -- the only reason cigarette companies survive is to make more people become addicted --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it's kind of conflicting in that way, um --
R:  And it's also -- it's also difficult -- um, I think it was on Sixty Minutes not too long ago -- maybe a year or so ago, um, they were showing the farmers -- the tobacco farmers in the south who may or may not smoke themselves, but their families depend on selling these tobacco leaves and if -- if cigarette companies stop making the amount of cigarettes that they did, then these family farms would go under, you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  So, that was -- that was like the other side of the -- for me, it was seeing kind of the -- the human interest part of -- "Oh, there are people that produce the -- that, you know, their lives are really affected".  I -- b- but I just don't think -- I'm very, um, opposed to smoking, you know, I don't see it as a good thing.  So, it's -- it's hard for me to give that side of the argument any kind of points, because I think it's so -- such a terrible habit.
L:  Yeah, I think there's always the human side of something, like I'm sure like cocaine farmers [several inaudible words] something like there's also a human side to that too, so it's kind of a hard -- hard, ah, argument to make, for me too.
R:  Yeah.  And then how do you feel about if you ban smoking, what could be the consequence of that?
L:  Ah, ban smoking in all the public places?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think people would just have to deal.  Like, I'm sure -- the -- the argument on the pro smoking side will be like, "Oh, they're taking away their -- their right" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, to -- to do whatever they want, but it's really not true because they're imposing like second hand smoke on others.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, I -- as -- as far as I can tell, there hasn't been too much like upraising in Boston or New York, ah, because of the legislation here
