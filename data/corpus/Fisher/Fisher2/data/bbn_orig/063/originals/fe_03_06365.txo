L:  [COUGH]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Linda.
L:  Uh, hi, Linda.  My name is Alex.
R:  Hi, Alex.
L:  So, yeah, I think, um, all those [NOISE] things that was me- -- that were mentioned are a good idea.  I think that, um, smoking is, [SIGH] you know, the tobacco industry [SIGH] deceived people on the risk of smoking, and I think helping people quit is a good idea.
R:  Well, I especially like the -- the idea of being able to go into a restaurant and into a public place, not being a smoker myself, and not having to worry about secondary smoke, um, having a clean environment.  I think, um, [MN] when we were subjected to the smoke in the environment then, um, those of us who didn't smoke were -- and we didn't have any rights or a choice for ourselves and so I -- I do appreciate the campaign and, um, what's going on as far as the -- the different ads and the -- the more -- [MN] definitely more pointed direction that we're going.
L:  Right.  I think that, um, you know, I -- I live in a big city, so it sounds strange, like, you know, you think, "Oh, people can just go outside" but, um, in the city I live in, it's so congested that I actually kind of have trouble when people are smoking, uh, near the subway or anything, you can't really get away from them, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it -- it -- or some people say you should just, you know, have a non smoking section and -- and that's good enough or, um, you know, just have enough of a place for people to get away from the smoke if they don't want to, um, be near it, but for me, it's like you can't even -- you can't get away from it.  But I do have a concern about, you know, the rights of s- -- the rights of smokers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I c- -- at the same ti- -- [MN] uh, at the same time, I kind of ... feel bad for them because, you know, they're -- they keep on having to be pushed into further and further corners and --
R:  Well, sure, you know, just -- just as we have our right to wanna breathe easy, [LAUGH] um, [MN] everybody does have their rights too, and -- and provision probably does need to be made -- made for that.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, so that they're not just [MN] feeling crammed into a corner or that they always have to outside.  Going outside for us u- up here would be, um, you'd catch your death -- your -- a death of cold in the winter time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, same here.
R:  I don't think you'd be smoking outside for long. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I've seen people in the dead of winter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just -- they're all, like, huddling together and, you know, it could be ten degrees outside and they're shivering --
R:  Yeah, well, mhm.
L:  -- but they're [MN] puffing on that -- puffing on that cigarette.
R:  Yeah, I know, I -- I'm talking, like, fifty below. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God.
R:  [LAUGH] But, you know, uh, um, I know as many as the -- what people may want even to quit smoking, that some people definitely just cannot and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- your heart does go out to -- to those who are, um, you know, you -- you don't like to see anybody in an uncomfortable position and you always want to -- to do the best for them as far as making a provision, but when it's not your choice of lifestyle also, neither should you be subjected to it and so, I mean --
L:  Well, I mean, it's a classic question.  How -- how far should government go --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in infringing upon the freedom of certain people --
R:  Sure.
L:  "-- and, you know, obviously people say, "When it starts to infringe on the freedom of others" but how far does it have to infringe, you know?  Is it --
R:  Right, where --
L:  -- any infringement is -- is --
R:  Where do we draw the line --
L:  -- a threat?
R:  -- but really, when you -- when you think about it, it's, um, sad maybe that it's gotten to the place where government has to step in.  There used to be a certain -- certain lines of respect when people were in public places or when people were in your home, there were certain lines of respect that, um, people who smoked didn't smoke in your presence or in front of you if you were a non smoker.
L:  Right, but if you're walking, uh, my -- my biggest problem is, well, you know, I can -- there's pretty much a, you know, a smoking corner in my building and there's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- designated smoking rooms in the l- -- in lunch areas and things like that.  Uh, that I don't have a problem with, um, you know, you have non smoking sections in restaurants.  Uh, where I do have a problem is when you're out on the street and people are smoking and there's no way that you can get away from it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you're -- you're walking along and maybe you're going down an escalator into the subway or something and they're --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- they're trying to pu- -- you know, you can't smoke in the subway, so they're trying to get those last puffs out before they go through the station.
R:  Yeah, well, and what about, like, in airplanes too?  I mean, that's kind of a very closed environment and -- and, um, you know, definitely no room for smokers now too, and some of those flights are very long.
L:  Right, right, and almost all flights are non smoking now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I can't think of any of 'em that -- that, um, allow it anymore.
L:  Um, I think that, I mean, how -- we talked about how the industry kind of influenced people and, um, you know, how we felt bad that they were being ostracized --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- but how long do you think the excuse can be used that, you know, "Oh, I didn't know what I was doing?"  I mean, how much longer is it going to be before we say, "Okay, you know what?  Like --"
R:  Personal responsibility.
L:  "-- maybe if you started smoking in, you know, the fifties, that's okay but --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- if you started smoking in the eighties, you know, the research from the Surgeon General et cetera was out in, like, you know, the sixties".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's been a good -- you may not -- you may have been born after the time period that, you know, medical research had already started.
R:  Yeah, that -- no, I -- thi- -- this is really hard for me to judge, because just, um, from where I come from it -- i- it would be -- to me, it's like common sense, [LAUGH] you know? [LAUGH] I don't need somebody -- I didn't need the Surgeon General to put out a statement for me to know that, um, breathing something in -- smoke into my lungs was probably not healthy for me, you know, and -- and to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that was  just co- -- a lot of that is commonsense, so I -- I do have a difficult time with people who -- who say, you know, they put the blame back onto the smoking companies, basically because, um, they feel like that they didn't know or didn't realize and -- and I kind of wonder, well, you know, what -- what they were really thinking.
L:  Well, do you support, um, uh, these lawsuits by smokers against smoke co- -- or -- or actually, and a more interesting question, do you support the lawsuits by, um, states against tobacco companies because, um, you know, they're losing money on Medic Aid programs by treating smokers?
R:  Mhm, mhm.  I really don't know that much about the lawsuits that are out there.  I do -- I mean, I've heard, I know that they're -- they're ongoing, and -- and I don't support tobacco companies, but, um, by the same -- by the same token, neither do I --
L:  But, I mean, at what p- -- at what point do you say, "Look, you should have known that -- you know, you knew you were doing bad -- you were doing harm to your body, you can't sue the company --"
R:  Right.
L:  "--  just because -- you know, it's product li- --"
R:  Well, I think I -- see, I think there's a --
L:  "-- it's product liability" but --
R:  Yeah, there's a personal responsibility that's upon each one of us too, that takes responsibility for the actions and the things that we do, because the things -- the choices that we make, each choice we make has a repercussion, um, and -- and that's true for all throughout our life, no matter w- -- no matter what we do, no matter what our choices are, um, there's -- there's repercussions and so, yeah, I don't like the smoking industry and I don't like the companies, but neither do I like people not being responsible for the choices that they made either.  And -- and, see, uh, that's where I think it [inaudible] the line, and perhaps where the government needs to come in then, and they have to draw a straight line on something that's not necessarily straight. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um ... do you think that, I mean, do you think that smokers should -- they obviously have to pay a higher life insurance premiums, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, a lot of people get health insurance via companies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, you're not the -- they pay the same, the company has to swallow the cost whether it's a smoker or a non smoker.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, do -- is that fair, that they're not having to pay an additional fee because they live a more -- because they're, you know, smoking?
R:  Because they choose to smoke?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I mean, I -- I could see the -- that it would be very fair for the health industry to have a -- a higher premium for those who would choose to smoke, because that's -- that's a choice, um, of what people are -- are doing, and if they're going to choose -- choose that, then they would, you know, possibly ha- -- have to consider choosing, um, a higher premium or -- because there's -- there's more definite -- definitely more, um, problems going to be associated with it.  What -- what do you think?
L:  But, you know, they're -- they're always going to come back and say, "Well, you know, if you're going to charge smokers more, maybe you should charge, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, people that eat --"
