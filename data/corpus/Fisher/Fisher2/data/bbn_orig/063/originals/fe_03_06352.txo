L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Laurie.
R:  Hello, Laurie, I'm Susan.
L:  Hi.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Niles, Michigan.
L:  Okay, and I'm from the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay, a suburb, Waukesha, it's called.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay, and I'm a non smoker.
R:  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, I -- I'm all for, uh, banning smoking, but I know -- I do have some friends that smoke and -- and they have a real problem with that.  But I still think that it is such an infringement [NOISE] on people's, [LIPSMACK] um, breathing, and no matter how far away in a restaurant or a public place you try to get from it, it's still there.
R:  Yeah, the smell is still there.
L:  Yes.
R:  The, um, uh, the -- the -- in -- the things in the air are still there.
L:  Right.
R:  They -- they --
L:  The harmful things.
R:  If you can get a different, separate room, that's another story.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, but, uh, if you're in the same room, somehow it's going to get there.  I agree, um, I have a boyfriend who was a smoker and he quit, and our home smells a lot better. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, I agree, and I've never -- I've actually never dated anyone even that smoked.  It was kinda one of those things that, [SIGH] um, was a preference of mine, and pretty much it turned off if I [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I [LAUGH] -- I -- and unfortunately my ex husband, [LAUGH] he chews smokeless tobacco. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I see, mhm.
L:  But he -- he did, like, the packets.  But that was bad enough --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and that's just as harmful for the lip or the cheek or the f- -- you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he did that every once in a while, but still, I -- I wouldn't kiss him if he had that in his mouth.  I'd make him brush his teeth and [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm, yeah, it sounds like my daughter, 'cause her -- her husband is the same way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it was on and off, it wasn't a consistent -- but it was pretty gross --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  It was one of those things that -- and my brother does that every so often when he needs to kick back and relax and I actually tried, to see -- those pouches --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to see what it was like, and I got such a buzz from it that I almost fell down --
R:  Well --
L:  -- it was that strong.
R:  Oh, dear.  Well, I --
L:  'Cause it goes right into your -- you know, your blood stream, you know, from the -- if you put it right next to your skin --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it goes right into your system.
R:  Oh, dear.  Oh, yeah, it doesn't sound very appealing.  Plus --
L:  No, and it -- the taste is bad and -- but I -- you know, all the curiosity things you do when you're in college. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, and with the young kids, you know, when they're younger, you know?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, exactly.
R:  So -- and that's not very good either, and I think that the -- the -- you know, anything they can do in the school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, to nip that in the bud is a good thing as well.
L:  I think so too.  My son admitted to me, he's fourteen, that he tried it.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And I was so afraid, I -- I was so shocked he even told me, and I was glad he did and -- and he said, "Mom, it is so bad" and, um, you know, e- even at fourteen, things have moved on maturity wise so much, that you see these young kids out, but it's so expensive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know --
R:  Thank God.
L:  -- everything -- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, really, they -- you know, it's against the law, and to get fined for it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it has everything going against it.
R:  And you would think that that would be a great deterrent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think the more education, um, I've seen some -- they've had some, um, uh, what do you call those?  Billboards --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- up where they show, um, a girl and her mouth is open and they have, like, cigarettes in there.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's like smoking an ashtray in there, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's like kissing an ashtray and stuff and I -- I think those are good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, because kids are -- are very, um, a- aware of their social life.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Their -- you know, their appearance, their -- you know, wear the right perfume, wear the right clothes, um, you know, these -- these -- I think this is a good way to, uh, uh, discourage them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from this, and I think that it's good that they have banned, um, like, uh, Camel -- that Camel --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- like a -- a -- a -- whatever he was. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, and Joe, I think they called him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it was good that they banned -- you know, that the -- the government banned that, because that is appealing to the younger folk.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, and -- you know, they're -- they're faced with choices all -- every day and sometimes I think they're not mature enough to make those choices.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, you know, it -- and a lot of it begins in the home, and if the parents smoke, then of course the kids are more likely to smoke, I think.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so, you know, parents have to take some of that responsibility.
L:  Right.
R:  On, um, to, uh, you know, to -- to -- to take control of their own lives first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, be -- you know, and -- and then their kids may follow.  Um, n- now -- now, only one of mine smokes --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- out of three.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I've always been a non smoker.
L:  Okay.
R:  So I feel that, you know, at least I got two out a three. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  I know.
R:  And -- and I had a father who died of -- of lung cancer.
L:  Okay.
R:  That went to his brain and so, you know, I always point that out to my children, I say, you know, uh, "This is what happens when you --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- smoke for years and years and years.  You know, you may think you're fine now but, you know, you're not invincible".
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  "Grandpa thought he was invincible too, and look what happened".
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, it -- you know, it is, uh, those kind of things that I look to find examples, um --
L:  Well, I know.  I work in the insurance industry also, and I tell my -- my kids, I said, "You know, people have to pay more if they're a smoker, plus if you get a respiratory infection, it takes longer to get over it".
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  And -- and they had -- their first, um, our neighbor was, like, their nanny and, um, she developed -- she -- oh, they both -- she and her husband, lovely people, neat as a pin, but both heavy smokers.  Their wallpaper was yellow and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  That's gross, too.
L:  -- i- it is and, you know, when she'd watch the kids, she'd go out in the garage, well, we'd open the garage door and [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  The -- the smoke smell, but she did honor -- you know, she realized that I didn't want her smoking, but even for her to take the kids over there, I was really hesitant but, you know, you feel so bad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you're, kind of, like, well, here's this lady taking such good care of my kids and she had an air cleaner going, but [SIGH] --
R:  E- even that, you know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- there's still some of that.  That's so hard, because you're trying to protect your kids from that sort of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  They when they see other adults doing it and stuff, that makes it difficult.  Um, you know, all you can do, I think, is to, you know, uh, hope for the -- the legislation for the, uh, uh, money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- too, so the education in schools start when they're very young --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, to give them, you know, an understanding of what happens in the lungs when you smoke.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  And different things like that, so that they can have -- at least be armed with some sort of education about it.
L:  Mhm.  I agree.
R:  You know, that's, to me, the important part, is if you get 'em when they're younger, and -- and put a negative spin on it then, let them know what the consequences can be, ask them about family members --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, that may have -- you know, have 'em ask their folks. [MN]
L:  And it's so hard to quit.  It's, like, you know, dieting, anything.  Any of those times you get into it or, you know, or you're overweight or you, you know, any of the addictive type things, that to try to quit is such a tough thing, so if you can avoid it.  I have people that I know that just smoke one or two cigarettes a week.  Well, [SIGH] they still have to pay smoker rates.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's, like, if you are down to that few, just -- just --
R:  Just stop.
L:  -- make a -- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But I think as far as -- as the ban in the re- restaurants, I think that's -- that's a, uh, that's a good thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because that protects everybody, you know?  There is the great outdoors, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's for everyone, you know, so --
L:  And there's usually most bars, you know, if -- if they really -- a lot of bars serve food and most bars allow the smoking.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's --
L:  Around here, anyway.
R:  Yeah, I get -- I know --
L:  You know, very --
R:  -- but, see, I guess I don't go for the social aspect of it, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  And, uh, so I just don't go there.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, even -- I almost re- -- uh, I very rarely go to a Bingo --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's if they've got a non smoking room, because I -- just my clothes just reek when I come out, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  My hair, and my clothes and everything, and so, you know, these -- the sort of education that the kids need to have is, you know, look at all these things, look at all the things that are detrimental, and how much it's going to cost you in the long run -- run, not only in buying it, but all your health problems, um, like, as you said, your insurance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and these things, if they are taught at a young age and continually taught through the school, you know, all the young ones have to go to school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  School's the perfect place for it, and if you could get the government to buy in to having the education for it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, of course, taxes and everything, but [LAUGH] we'd all have to pay for that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But didn't it -- I know with our highways here, I think, um, I know for highway funding, they had to lower our drive, um, drunk driving, uh, alcohol level --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so, you know, I know to get funding, if they have to [NOISE] raise the price again of cigarettes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which they're ver- -- I don't even know what a pack costs now.
R:  That's, uh, t- two or three dollars, I think.  Maybe even more.
L:  Oh, I think it's more than -- I think it's four, five.
R:  Yeah, it's quite expensive.
L:  L- like a car- carton, which is -- is that twelve packs?  It's like forty or thirty five.
R:  Yeah, that's a lot of money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and I know -- but -- but how much more can they raise it? [LAUGH] I mean [LAUGH] --
L:  I know.
R:  -- they've been, you know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- fifty cents a pack, a dollar a pack, and being all these taxes, and yet ha- have they really earmarked that money though?
L:  Right.
R:  See, that's the whole thing.  They say that they're going to do that, and that they're going earm- earmark the money for education or -- or whatever, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But in the long run, do they?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they need to be held -- the legislators need to be held accountable for that as well.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?  It's just, like, "We're gonna -- we're raising these taxes, okay?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:   And, well, the thing that bothers me is we have, in Michigan, a lottery system, you know?
L:  Okay.
R:  And they said that all the money from the lottery is going to go into school, you know?  And I thought, "Well, you know, that's a good thing".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Um, the schools need support.  However, you know, I think what's happened is, yes, that -- that the money from the lottery is going to the schools, but the money that was in the budget for the schools is gradually being replaced by the money from the lottery.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, what good is that, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  They're -- and that -- that -- I think the legislators --
