L:  Hi --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this is Sheri[?].
R:  Hi, this is Jessica.
L:  Hi --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Jessica.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Oh, I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty good.  What do you think about smoking?
R:  Um, well I don't smoke, but my husband does --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and --
L:  Sounds like me.
R:  Sounds like you?
L:  I don't smoke, but my son smokes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, my husband's always been real good about, ah, smoking outside and, ah, so he doesn't do it in the house, which is kind of nice, um --
L:  Yeah, that is a big help.
R:  It is. [NOISE] It really is, um, and I really appreciate the fact that, you know, he, ah -- that he chooses to smoke -- it's -- though he's tried to quit a million times. [LAUGH] But --
L:  Oh, I think they all do.  They say it's pretty hard.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But as far as these bans on smoking that they're putting in the restaurants and so forth --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I- I'm all for it.  How about you?
R:  I'm all for it too.  I -- I feel like, um, people who are -- ah, who want to smoke, it's something that they've made a choice to do, but because second hand smoke is something that, ah, can harm other people --
L:  Yes, I --
R:  -- and so I say, you know [NOISE] --
L:  I agree with it.
R:  -- it's not fair to impose that on someone else, um --
L:  Right.  I agree.  And everytime you go to one of these doggone restaurants where there's smoking allowed and so forth, you come out smelling like a cigarette stick, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  You do. [NOISE]
L:  And that's not good.
R:  You don't -- see, in the part of the country where I am I'm close --y- -- I live in Wyoming and I'm close to Utah and you don't [NOISE] see smoking restaurants in Utah at all --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  Yeah, everything's non smoking --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- here in Wyoming, you see a few --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, [NOISE] mostly think --
L:  Well, I'm all the way in Pennsylvania and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're just beginning --
R:  Th- -- oh, are they?
L:  -- to get rid of the smoking.  Yeah, there's -- and, I mean, it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's -- they smoke all over the place.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They're finally starting to phase it out around the office buildings and so forth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think the fines --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and so forth and the different campaigns and ads --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are definitely making people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that don't smoke --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have enough strength to speak up [LAUGH], you know?
R:  About it?  Yeah.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  And get together and --
R:  And because they say that, you know, a person who, um -- that the smoke [NOISE] is three -- I think they sa- -- anyway, I read somewhere that it was three times more dangerous to a non smoker, than [NOISE] --
L:  I --
R:  -- to a smoker.
L:  I think it must be.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Because I -- I have an ex husband --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that smoked and smoked and I -- I actually did get a -- an esophageal disease from his second --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hand smoke.
R:  Oh, did you really?
L:  Ah, yes and the doctor told him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you have to stop smoking, especially around Sheri --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he didn't.  So, as a result --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we are no longer married --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because I felt that my health was much more [LAUGH] important.
R:  Well, he should of too, you know, I mean it --
L:  He should of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I agree, if he didn't think enough of my health --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- follow doctor's orders.  So, in essence, actually all of these ads and campaigns that -- against the smoking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and banning smoking in private places is really, like you said, a million percent benefit to those who don't smoke.
R:  Oh, I agree.  I think we have too many problems nowadays, um, higher rates of people with respiratory illnesses like asthma --
L:  Yes [inaudible].
R:  -- that you don't know who you might be sitting next to in a restaurant --
L:  No, that's for sure.
R:  -- you have a child with asthma and somebody lights a cigarette and that child goes into a severe asthma attack and dies, I mean --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I wouldn't want to be responsible for something horrible like that.
L:  Nope and even if -- if you were the mother of the child, you'd never know who to -- who to go after, because so many people do smoke --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, in the restaurants and so forth.  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even though they do have the separated smoking and non smoking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sections, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't even feel is the best answer.  I think that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- total non smoking is a much better answer.
R:  In public areas.  I totally agree.
L:  Yes.
R:  Any place that the public is at.  I'm always amazed when I go somewhere like amusement parks [NOISE] or, um, zoos and people smoke. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It always shocks me, because I don't -- you don't see it in ma- -- a lot of the restaurants and stuff out here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, so I'm always surprised.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Years ago here, [NOISE] they used to smoke in the grocery stores --
L:  Oh, you're kidding.
R:  -- uh-uh and --
L:  See -- um, I don't think I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, you know what, maybe I did quite a long time ago see people smoking in grocery stores.  I will say Pennsylvania has at least evolved to non smoking in grocery stores --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We've -- we've been that way for a long time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but um, I know my sister lives in California, they haven't had any smoking in their restaurants or public restaurants for many years now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and when my ex husband --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I went over to visit, he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just was furious because he couldn't smoke in the restaurants.  So, [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as a result --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we didn't go to, um, restaurants too often --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when --
R:  Too often.
L:  -- we went to visit them.  Yeah.
R:  Well, I can remember when they used to have it on airplanes too and I remember my dad, um, doing -- um, he smoked and I remember how irritated he was with that but [NOISE] --
L:  Right and even if they put them in the back rows, that air circulates all the way through.
R:  It does.  It -- you know, even though they had the vents and stuff on, it was horrible [NOISE] in airplanes.
L:  It sure was.
R:  I remember how sick it made me and I always thought -- when I was a kid, got sick on the airplanes [NOISE] and -- and of course got car sick, because you know, my dad smoked five packs a day, so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's terrible.
R:  And he always smoked in the car with us kids and ...
L:  And I'm sure that didn't help your respiratory [LAUGH] problems either.
R:  No -- well, you know, I had --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- bronchiolar pneumonia the whole time I was growing up --
L:  Yes [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- and that's what they attributed it too.
L:  I wouldn't doubt it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I wouldn't doubt it at all. [NOISE]
R:  So -- but you know, you see, you know, different places that they used to -- I wish they would, ah, have total non smoking, um, hotels because the few times I've asked [NOISE] for non smoking and gotten smoking rooms --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and e- even though my husband smokes, he goes outside so you don't get the full effect of the --
L:  Exactly.  Well, you can --
R:  -- smell and stuff.
L:  I was going to say --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can really appreciate people that are willing to cooperate like that --
R:  He's been really great.
L:  -- you know, he knows [inaudible] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  You know, about be- -- staying outside and he doesn't smoke in the car and stuff, you know?
L:  Oh?
R:  If he wants a cigarette we -- he stops at a rest stop and he gets out and has his cigarette, that's what he wants to do and [NOISE] so.
L:  Oh, that's great --
R:  But I think people should --
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  -- be more enlightened about other people's health and be more concerned --
L:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.
R:  -- [NOISE] you know?  Not just for people they know but for their neighbor, for the guy that lives down the street or the people they don't know, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Peo- -- other people's health should be of concern to all of us, because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, they say in this country that smoking costs us billions of dollars --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- in our tax money.
L:  -- I'm sure of it.  Not only as far as the diseases from both the smoke and the second hand smoke, but also the missed work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because you're -- ah, the illness, the excessive prices of life insurance -- health insurance, rather.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's just --
R:  And -- well -- and it affects all of our insurance --
L:  Yep --
R:  -- you know?  You and I --
L:  -- it sure does.
R:  -- get to pay higher medical insurance for the peop- -- because of people who smoke. [NOISE]
L:  And the smokers, isn't that wonderful? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. It is [NOISE], but you know, we pay for it -- you know, I'm -- I -- I don't [NOISE] complain too much about that but [NOISE] -- because you know, we also pay for people that are overweight, which I am --
L:  Mm.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, people [LAUGH] who, you know, are overweight [LAUGH] cause things to go up too and, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- things like that and I try not --
L:  -- the one thing with overweightness[?] though is you're not making anyone else ill --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the process.
R:  No.  You know, and that's the bad -- oh, you know -- and so, I try to be more understanding [NOISE], you know?  But I'm -- I'm grateful that my husband isn't [NOISE] like most people are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, about their smoking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  I've -- I've seen people [NOISE] in places with little tiny babies, in little enclosed areas, smoking --
L:  Uh-huh.  And --
R:  -- and I think, "Oh" --
L:  Yeah and you've got both parents smoking.  One thing that I'm really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- glad about is there are quite a few --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I like to cruise, go on cruises --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and several ships now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have the smoking side.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If you want to smoke you have to smoke outside on the deck --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and there are even one or two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smokeless cruises --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that is great.
L:  -- so.  Oh, it's wonderful.  It's a -- a fantastic improvement --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and in the street, every place I think -- all of the public, exc- -- facility places, you know, and when they can take it all the way out to the open seas, well it's doing a world of good --
R:  It is.  I think --
L:  -- to have them --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- campaigning against it.
R:  I just can't imagine how people, you know, really -- I even ask my husband, "Doesn't it bother you to spend four dollars [LAUGH] on a pack of cigarettes?" --
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- that's for sure.
R:  Y- you know?  I mean, it- it's like, you know, if they -- they buy just one pack a day it's still, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- like a hundred dollars a month --
L:  But you know what --
R:  -- and that's we're we live, not in big c- -- you know, like California and Utah, they have really --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- high taxes on there's.
L:  Oh.  I know North Carolina is -- they don't have any I don't think.  I mean, I have a friend that even buys her cigarettes over the internet, which is disgusting.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  It's amazing that they can even do that, but --
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  -- you know?
L:  I love being on the internet and doing things on the computer, but when it comes to some of the advertisements on there -- now, when you get to an advertisement banning the cigarettes or -- or advertising places -- public places that offer
