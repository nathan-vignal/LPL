L:  Hi, I'm Dielda[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Sonya. [NOISE]
L:  You're what?  What's your name?
R:  Sonya.
L:  Sonya?
R:  Yes.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Thank you, you too.  And that's my son, Jordan [LAUGH] in the background. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] M- my boys are in school.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about, um --
R:  Terrorism.
L:  Terrorism and if --
R:  We think people would remain calm or panic.
L:  Or panic.  And how we think most people would react or --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- how we would react to ...
R:  Yes.  Well, you want me to go first?  You want --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- to go fir- --
L:  Go first.
R:  Um, I do think people would probably panic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Obviously. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, yeah.
R:  Um, just because we're just so touchy about the whole thing right now.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] personally I ... [SIGH] I don't know.  It's ... part of me feels that I would panic and then part of me feels that I would remain calm but be scared, of course --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, um, because you don't know what to do, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I wouldn't know what to do.
L:  Well I, um ... I -- when September eleventh hit, all three of my boys were in school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I thought -- I had the luxury of being alone.  I mean -- well, the boys saw -- saw it on TV but then I took them to school.
R:  Right.
L:  And then the, um, President -- I live in Omaha, Nebraska and the President flew in --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- here.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, so -- and -- and so that concerned me more.  That panicked me more because I felt like my community was a -- a huge target.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And, um, and I did call the school -- I did panic a little bit 'cause -- when the President came, because I ... because of the -- you know, I thought that we were a huge target and then I called the school and they ... the school secretary kind of calmed me down.  I do think I would try to not panic if my kids were around because that feeds ...
R:  Right.
L:  ... [MN] on itself and feed- -- the kids react to that and ... so I know I would try not to -- and it also depends if my husband's around too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because then I would feel ... I would feel more calm because, you know, he -- I'd have some other adult.  That makes a big difference.  So I think it pr- -- for me it -- it pretty much depends on if my kids are around and who's all around, if I'm alone or --
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause if I'm alone I think I would panic.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um ...
R:  See, that's interesting bringing up nine eleven too because I was actually pregnant --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, on nine eleven.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He was born eleven days after, ironically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I had a doctor's appointment that day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I was with my husband [NOISE] because we were [NOISE] actually waiting -- it was interesting, our car needed to be fixed too. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So we were waiting on the tow truck and -- for the one car, and then, you know, we were going to head over to [NOISE] my doctor's appointment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- after the tow truck came.  And I remember hearing it on the radio and I really thought it was a joke at first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because remember at first they just talked about the planes; it wasn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even thought about that it might be a terrorist attack.  And so we were just talking about the planes and everything and ... it's like, "No, that's not ... there -- somebody's doing a bad, joke", you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the second one hit and it's like, "What is going on?"  And then you hear about the planes in Washington and then -- at that point I think I started getting antsy 'cause it was like, "What's going on?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm in Atlanta --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so it was like, "Are they gonna try to hit something that's big here?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Who's doing this?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Obviously with two plans hi- -- planes hitting the Twin Towers and then something happening in -- in DC, this isn't a joke, this is for real".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, i- it's the first time I've ever experienced anything like that.  You hear about it happening overseas all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but never here.  And you're right, I guess it kind of depends on how much of your family you have with you so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you at least know that they're in front of you and whatever happens is gonna happen with all three of you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or all however many of you, but it's still ... I don't know.  It's really -- it's a tough c- -- [SIGH] I guess you --
L:  I think -- I think the closer -- I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay.
L:  I think the closer you are to the epicenter of -- of the terrorist act, the more panic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there will be around there.  Like look at, uh, look at New York and the Twin Towers and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There was mayhem.
R:  Yes.
L:  There was panic and mayhem and that feeds -- feeds off each other.  You know, it's, like, called mass hysteria; it just feeds -- people feed off of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, and it -- it just -- I think -- but, like, as you get farther away from that, uh --
R:  It's more of an empathy --
L:  -- distance --
R:  -- kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I, [MN] you know, I don't think anyone would ... I really [LAUGH] d- doubt that anyone would do anything in Omaha, Nebraska, although we did have that crazy college kids with the bombs in the -- in the, uh, mailboxes but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was -- that was small in comparison to ... [LIPSMACK] I -- I guess it can happen everywhere but you just don't think in -- in the Midwest. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's go- -- and it's going to happen in New York or LA or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's not going to happen ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, bu- -- and I think -- I think a lotta Americ- Americans think like that, that, you know, it's -- well, I know we thought -- the whole country thought like that because we constantly were seeing Israel bombarded with terrorism and --
R:  Yes.  Exactly.
L:  -- and that type of -- type of thing and --
R:  Which is why it took us off guard.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we were basically dumb.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Dumb and, um ... and I kept thinking, "Well, what made us think that it couldn't happen here?"
R:  Exactly.  Because, like you said, we're -- we're dumb and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when you see it happening everywhere else you feel sorry for those people but it never ever occurs to you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that it can happen with you.
L:  [MN]
R:  And I think the United States thinks that we're so tough and strong and big that nobody's gonna try to touch us.
L:  Right.
R:  And nine eleven proved it wrong.  And then I -- you know, I was looking at something on the news the other day and they were talking about how we have, you know, like, we're in a high alert status right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we have all these policemen and, you know, National Guard and people who are quote unquote trained to handle these kinds of situations.  But look at what happened, we had all of that same thing when we had the Olympics here in ninety six.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And the bomb still went off. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know what I mean?  A -- a lady
L:  Uh --
R:  -- unfortunately still passed away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So how much good is it really to have policemen, et cetera?  They're human as well.  They can be blown up as well.
L:  Right.
R:  And do you really, you know, are you justified in feeling safer just because you see a lot of people who are supposedly trained in protection? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Ye- yeah.
R:  That -- that's why it really is all -- you're right, it's relative because, yeah, the closer you are to it, probably the more scared --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- you are, but I think there's also a fear of not knowing what's next, which can kind of send you into panic mode too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because definitely on that day it was, like, you know, you're -- you start to think about all the different things that they can hit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that would make a difference and would definitely touch you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, all the different places in Atlanta that would definitely -- kind of depending on what their focus is, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Are you d- -- are you trying to hit all of our finances?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Are you trying to kill the power system, or ...?"  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  And you start thinking, "Well, we have a big power plant here, we have a big, you know, financial s- -- district here" and that's where the fear comes in too.
L:  But don't you -- don't you think that c- -- for -- as for me, I don't -- I won't live in fear.  I won't --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I just won't -- I -- it's just that day I was scared but I didn't take my boys out, I didn't want -- I didn't wanna give into that fear.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't -- because I didn't want it to paralyze me and I didn't want the bo- -- my boys to think that ... that -- that -- that when you're scared of something or when bad things happen you shouldn't just carry on.
R:  Yeah, that's true too.
L:  I'm not saying you ignore it but I'm just saying that you -- you like, "Okay, I'm scared. [LAUGH] I'm scared --"
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  "-- I'll just carry on".
R:  "But I can't let it stop me".
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah, you're right.  I mean --
L:  And I just don't think that this country and the people in it are willing to be -- well, m- -- for the most part are willing to be scared into not living their lives the way they normally do.
R:  Yeah, that's true too because the bottom line is: no matter what, what's gonna happen is gonna happen --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- no matter how you try to prevent it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or how you think you're preventing it.  And if it's meant for you to go, when it happens, you're going.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] You can't hide from it.
L:  Right, it --
R:  So yeah, from that perspective, it definitely should not cause you to stop living the way you would normally live.
L:  Right, and you can't -- I mean, it was a horrible, horrific, horrendous thing that happened --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, and things like that happen all the time in the Middle East.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we just don't get it.
R:  We're not used to that.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] No, we -- we don't; we're not used to that.  And we haven't ... I mean, I'd love to go to Israel and see how -- how it is there and -- and how those people react to it and what -- what precautions they take.  I know they're a tiny country but I would love for us to be more, um, up on what they're doing.  I know we know what they're doing as far as counterterror-
