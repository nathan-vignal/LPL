R:  Hi, my name is Christina.
L:  Hi, this Helen, I'm from Michigan.
R:  I'm calling from Washington, DC.
L:  Oh.  They gave you a -- us a topic of, I guess, terrorist attacks and how --
R:  A- and how you would react.
L:  -- you would -- right.
R:  Um, I guess I would be scared if, um, I was -- well, remembering back in nine eleven, working downtown DC, you know, um, it was a work day and everyone, you kn- -- [MN] and that was just crazy and reminded me of Independence Day, the movie.  And that's how everyone was running in the streets downtown DC on that day, nine eleven.
L:  Panicking and -- hm.
R:  And panicking and, oh, gridlock cars and gridlock ... people were running in the streets.  Subways weren't running.  So --
L:  In our town everybody was filling u- -- I live in a small town, there's not very many people and I'm kind of out in the country, but everyone was filling up with gas.  I don't know where everyone thought they were going but everyone was getting gas.  I was in line too.
R:  They wanted to leave town. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] So I was getting gas too.  I figured if everyone was panicking I'd better get gas in my car too. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I -- I don't -- I -- I don't we're -- we are prepared for any acts of terrorism.  We're not really prepared.
L:  No, and especially if it was something biological and needing medical attention.  I don't think the hospitals and all of that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- are trained ...
R:  Could handle ...
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  ... that.  [LAUGH] Um ... [LIPSMACK] it really scares me, especially in the news with -- yesterday with the bombing at Yale University.
L:  Yes, that was very --
R:  That brought -- you know, that made me think about, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, are they still out there, are they still plotting against the United States?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- and es- -- and especially in Washington, DC, we're always on alert because this is the capital city, the President is here.
L:  I- -- right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So everybody's just always edgy.  Um, on the metro system everybody's just always aware.  I used to sleep on the metro train but I don't --
L:  Really?
R:  -- do it any longer.  Mhm.  Doing my -- doing a commute --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, you could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- close your eyes and everything but -- yeah, I try to be observant now.
L:  Yeah, it is scary.  I can imagine --
R:  I- -- and watching, you know, watching everyone.  And I happen to work downtown and get off at the White House metro station, so that's --
L:  Really?  Wow.
R:  -- extra touchy. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  Wow.  So I'm sure --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you were right in the --
R:  We were right --
L:  -- front of it there, right when --
R:  -- right downtown.
L:  -- everything was happening.
R:  That's it.  So ...
L:  It would have been scary.
R:  It is -- is scary and I -- I don't know ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know what we have in store.
L:  [several inaudible words] and our poor President.
R:  What they have in store for us.
L:  The poor President, with all the stuff he's gotta deal with.  I feel [LAUGH] sorry for him.
R:  Yeah, I do feel sorry for him.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] but, you know, he's the leader of our country and he has to lea- ... keep a level head and lead everyone, you know, lead all the citizens.
L:  And he does a good job.
R:  [LIPSMACK] He does a good job.  I approve of him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] ... is it time?  How long do we have to talk for? [LAUGH]
L:  Ten minutes, I think that's what the -- the recording said was ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  How long have we talked?
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know, I didn't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- look at my watch. [LAUGH]
R:  That's weird.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh ...
L:  Is this your first call that you've done?
R:  This is my first call.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How many calls have you done?
L:  I think they allow three and I've done one --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- already.  And I think --
R:  Em --
L:  -- it's three.  I think it's sponsored by a Government grant or something.  The college has a --
R:  Y- -- what is it for?
L:  The -- I think they're studying, like ...
R:  How people can just up and speak with each other.
L:  Right.  And, like, it's through a Government grant, I guess, through Pennsylvania College.
R:  Yeah, University of Pennsyl- -- I found it on line.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um ... but ... you know, I'm just scared of terrorism.  Wh- what is your ...?
L:  I am too --
R:  Ha- --
L:  -- I've got, um, two small kids.  I've got a four year old and a two year old and it's just scary.
R:  Yeah.  Just --
L:  And, uh, when there's stuff on the news I try to ... if they come in the room and they're ... wanna see TV or whatever I try to not have a lot of the --
R:  News and everything.
L:  Yeah, and when -- right, when there's the bad stuff going on --
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  -- like, with the war and everything like that.
R:  Ah, gosh.  And how the --
L:  [inaudible] scary.
R:  Yeah, it is.  I've got a ten year old so I was extra scared with him in school --
L:  Oh, I bet, wow.
R:  The schools were letting the kids out and I didn't know how to get -- get to my son.  You know, I had to walk because the metro wasn't running -- or the metro was over packed.  So ... yeah, and I know it's actually scary for the kids, 'cause I don't remember coming up and having to deal with anything like this.
L:  Mhm.  I mean, your son must have really been scared too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Why are the schools let out?" and ...
R:  Wondering and -- just wondering what's going on.  You know, a plane was flying, it was, um ... [LIPSMACK] supposedly flying to Washington, DC, that plane that they took down in Pennsylvania ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  ... that crashed in the ground.  That plane was supposed to come to DC.
L:  Wow.
R:  So that was really scary.  Everyone says, "There's a plane coming to DC, it's gonna --"
L:  It --
R:  "-- crash the Monument or the White House".
L:  It is just amazing that those people on board overthrew the ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  ... hijackers.
R:  Yeah, that was amazing bec- -- they -- they knew they ... I probably would have been on board with that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, um ...
L:  You know you're going to g-, ah, die anyway.
R:  You're going to go anyway --
L:  Might as well --
R:  And try to save --
L:  -- do your last good deed.
R:  Good deed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and save a lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more people.
L:  W- -- yeah, I think after the terrorist attack that that, uh, brought of the -- more people to churches and, um, made 'em stronger in their faith --
R:  Right.
L:  -- too and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- family, closer to their families and --
R:  Closer to your family, stronger in your faith.
L:  Mhm.
R:  These are -- that's basically all you have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now, um ... [LIPSMACK] that's -- that's basically all you have to keep you -- keep you -- keep your sanity: your faith and your family.  That's it.  And I know we've talked ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Gosh.  Bu- --
L:  They come on, I think, and say like, "Thirty seconds left".
R:  Okay.
L:  There's a recording of some lady that comes on and then right after that -- it doesn't even seem like thirty seconds and you get cut off.
R:  Okay.
L:  They ask you did you want to leave a comment about the project or anything.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
L:  Uh --
R:  I wonder why they picked that topic.  That's not a fun topic --
L:  No.
R:  -- to talk about.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm [several inaudible words] alert.
L:  Maybe it's something -- 'cause they raised the alert level yesterday or something.
R:  Yeah, they surely did.  With that --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- especially with that bombing out there.
L:  Mhm, and espec- --
R:  At Bush's old school.
L:  With Memorial day coming along for ...
R:  We have -- well, we have, like, two hundred and fifty thousand motorcycle riders that's coming to DC this weekend.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, I forget what they call 'em.  But you'll probably catch it on your news but they're coming through this weekend.  Two hundred and fifty motorcycle riders.  They're old veterans and everything.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] I forget what they call 'em.  You'll see it.  So that's --
L:  But they're not policemen, they're just ...?
R:  They're not policemen, they're just old vets.  They're, I guess, [several inaudible words] um, motorcycle riders, and they're riding their motorcycles to DC this weekend for --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- Memorial weekend.  Yep, it'll be on the news.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] but, you know, they've gotta be careful with that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause they know they're going to be down on the Mall.
L:  So they must have -- do they have military people out on the streets and stuff?
R:  No, they don't have the military --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- people but they're going to have the Park Police, DC Police, um, Virginia Police and the Maryland Police.  Yeah, Capital Hill Police.  But you know what, they probably will have National Guard and stuff down there on Saturday when it, you know, actually happens.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because that's a big crowd, two hundred -- that's quarter of a million [LAUGH] people.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  That's coming down on the Mall.
L:  It must be packed, the hotels and everything.
R:  Yep, the ho- --
L:  All those people coming.
R:  [MN] Mm, the ho- -- you know, the hotels and -- we're a tourist town. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's where we make our money.  Hotels and, you know, entertainment and stuff like that.
L:  And especially now if people aren't really traveling a lot, if they are they're going by car or --
R:  They're not going -- [inaudible] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- people don't want to come to DC now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they're staying away.
L:  I've never been out there, someday -- but I'd like to go but, uh --
R:  Not right now.
L:  You -- [LIPSMACK] right, right.
R:  Let's wait until this [LAUGH] --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- alert has gone, huh?
L:  [inaudible] calmer. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's okay.  It's -- it's just busy.  You -- you know, you get Maryland and Virginia and DC are all in -- you know, basically all in one and everybody commutes from those two states to DC.  You know, the Government and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's okay.  And what town are you from?
L:  Um, Hastings, Michigan.  It's just --
R:  Oh, from Michigan.
L:  -- south of Grand Rapids.
R:  Okay, all right.
L:  And there's probably maybe three thousand people in the town, it's not a very big town.
R:  It's a small town.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You like?  Is it nice to live in a smaller town?
L:  It is.  There's, like, deer in our backyard and ...
R:  E- everything is --
L:  ... there's all kinds of wildlife.  Mhm.
R:  -- is it slow like?
L:  It is.  We --
R:  Okay.  Peaceful.
L:  Our house sits on five acres and we're just out in the woods and don't hear cars going down the road and it's really nice.
R:  And ambulances. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] So it's nice to get away.
R:  Oh, well, that's nice.
L:  So --
R:  To- -- two totally different people.
L:  Yeah, my kids love playing outside in the yard and --
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's good for the kids.
L:  Our dog and ... a cocker spaniel and [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] I don't have any pets.
L:  Don't you?  Uh --
R:  Well, actually I live in a condo and ...
L:  Probably they don't allow pets.
R:  No, we just don't have space for a pet and they don't allow pets.  So ... [LIPSMACK] I wish I did have land [inaudible] run on and, you know, garden and stuff like that.  What I got is up in a condo and it's just, you know, people -- there's just people everywhere.  That's how -- in the city.  But I -- I love DC.  I wouldn't wanna [SIGH] change it for -- for the world.  I'm going to stay in DC, I think.
L:  So have you actually seen the White House and everything before?
