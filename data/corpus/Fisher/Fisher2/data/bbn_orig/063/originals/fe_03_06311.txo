L:  Hello.
R:  Hello -- hello.  My name is Richard.
L:  My name is Kendra.
R:  Hello, Kendra.  I'm very glad to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Okay, today's sock -- ah, topic is, ah, smoking and the anti smoking campaigns, and the, ah, anti smoking pro- -- ah, yeah, the smoking prohibitions that are being put into practice throughout the country.  And they want to know how we feel about that.
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, I'm not a smoker myself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and personally don't care to be around people who are smoking, mainly because I have such high allergies to it.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, I also feel like it's their decision to do this and, um, so, um -- you know, that they can do whatever they want.  And they're adults, and -- and if they wanna smoke then that's fine.  Um, [LIPSMACK] personally I know that when I go to a restaurant I don't care to sit in the smoking section.  But as long as they have a non smoking section, I'm actively away from it -- I'm fine with it. 
R:  Ah, okay.  Well, I quite agree you.  I am a ex smoker.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But, I am not a health fascist.  I am a great believer in, um -- as you pretty much -- ah, pretty much in accord -- ah, accord with what you said.  First of all, I si- -- I believe simply there are a lot of places that, if it really annoys me, I just won't go there.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, ah, I know many people who are non smokers, but they jump in a car -- they have a very expensive car, which consumes tremendous amounts of, um, fuel -- gasoline.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they do more polluting in a day than a -- than the average, like, chain --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- smoker will do in a lifetime.
L:  Right.
R:  Therefore, I am somewhat -- I -- I am somewhat skeptical, not of the effort to limit smoking, 'cause I'm all for anti smoking campaigns.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I think education is the answer.
L:  Absolutely.  I agree.
R:  But -- but, somehow these draconian measures, such as forbidding smoking in public places -- ah, particularly bars, ah -- ah, unfortunately --
L:  Yeah, you just expect it there.  
R:  Yeah, exactly.  And that's sort of, like, the standard behaviour.  If you don't particularly care for the atmosphere, don't go.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I could --
L:  And I stay away from those areas.
R:  And I -- so do I.
L:  Bowling alleys?  There's no way I could go bowling.  I just -- you know, I know that it's gonna happen, so I just don't -- I just don't go there.
R:  [MN] Well, you and I are quite in agreement on that.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Okay.  Now, how do you feel about, ah, the effectiveness of, ah, anti cam- -- ah, anti smoking campaigns? 
L:  Well, I'm all for 'em because I think -- I agree with you.  If you can get 'em and educate 'em, especially our young, um, kids into not smoking then they're gonna be healthier for the rest of their lives, if they can stay away from it.
R:  [MN]
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] it's just a matter of finding something that works, you know.  And I think sometimes some of these commercials are -- are there, but kids just think, "Oh that's not talking to me".
R:  Right.  And also, I think if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you really want to hit them -- ah, I mean, really to impact upon the, um, smoking -- tobacco use, the best way to do that is to, um, convince kids that it's not the sophisticated sort of thing to do.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Okay?  It's a -- suicide is not necessarily the height of sophistication.  It's quite -- it's, ah, other -- [MN] well, in itself it's -- by definition, it's self destructive.  But also, there are also many o- other things you can do with our money. [MN] 
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  And wi- -- and I remember I think I quit smoking when cigarettes were about a dollar fifty a pack.
L:  Oh my. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I mean, that was before -- that was before the flood. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, I remem- -- and I remember the most important -- the reason that I did was that -- ironically enough I was smoking about a pack a day.  And I was home during college and, um, my brother -- I left my cigarettes on the, um -- on the bureau.  And, um, my brother -- I knew when I'd got home that he would've smoked every cigarette in that pack.  And I said, "Well, I'll fix him.  I'll never smoke again". [LAUGH]  And that was the end of it.
L:  Wow, that's amazing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And you quit that easily?
R:  Just felt like -- I was so annoyed, okay?  I was just so annoyed.  I would -- the fact that I had left them home, and I kn- -- and I know -- and I know my brother, who can be unscrupulous when it comes to the use of other people's things like that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I knew he would have consumed them.
L:  So, does he smoke now?
R:  Huh?
L:  Does he smoke now?
R:  Ah, he smokes, but he smokes -- he smokes occasionally, okay?
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Well, okay -- well, I -- I would say he smokes, and I would say regularly, but, I don't think it's more than two or three cigarettes a day.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And although --
L:  Well, I guess you can thank him.
R:  Yes, I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- certainly can. [LAUGH]  I can thank -- I can thank my own lack of diligence --
L:   [LAUGH]
R:   -- [LAUGH] and just -- just -- just my insistence.  You know, I was just rushing out of the house to work during my summer job.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I just left -- and I was so a- -- I was just so annoyed that I could -- and I said, "No, that's the end of it.  I'll fix him".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "I'll never smoke again". [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And w- --
L:   Yeah, absolutely.
R:  And so -- but, I believe that sort of reaction makes a lot of sense.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  And besides -- with education.  I don't think lecturing or, um, assuming the high moral ground -- "I am so self righteous.  I don't smoke".
L:  Right.
R:  No, it's the idea, "I don't smoke because I choose not to".  It's very simple.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, wh- -- have you seen any interesting anti smoking campaigns?  Any that you endorse? 
L:  You know, I -- I -- I -- I can't even think of any to -- right off the top of my head.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I mean, I've seen the -- you know, the Nico- -- ah, the Nicotrol patch and all those types of things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, they're not really anti smoking campaigns.  They're more just a company trying to sell their product.
R:  Well, exactly.  Mhm.
L:  Um, which is -- I mean, if those work and they can get people to stop, great.  I mean, I'm -- I'm glad, you know.  But, I don't -- and that's the only thing I can think of.  Can you think of anything?
R:  Let me think.  I think basically -- ah, I'm not a great -- just say no sort of deal.  But, I think the campaign on TV where -- first of all, parents talk to their children.  I think --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that's a very good campaign.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- talk to them.  Tell them, "Hey, smoking is not cool, okay".
L:  Exactly.
R:  There is -- you know, it's -- it's -- it's -- it can be a dirty habit, it takes -- for me, it's the money.  And also, it's a -- it impairs your health.  So --
L: Yeah.
R:  -- look, there are so many other things you could do with that -- with your --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- money and with your time.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Or, if you have nothing else to do with your hands, [LAUGH] grab a book.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I got into crafts 'cause I -- I like to do things with my hands. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay -- okay.  What do you -- okay -- okay.  Well, crafts -- now crafts -- that's -- that's a good idea.  I don't know -- I think that'd make a great campaign.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Don't smoke, make something.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  That's right.  Do something productive.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That is --
L:  So -- but --
R:  -- truly great.
L:  I ag- -- I agree.  You know, there is one I can think of, now that I'm -- now that we're talking.  It's the one where the parents had talked and, um, the te- -- the girl -- the teenage girl's out with a group of friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And somebody asks her if she wants to smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and she says no --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because her parents had educated her and talked to her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's the only one I can think of in that --
R:  I've --
L:  -- kind of --
R:  -- seen one quite similar.  It's not the girl though.  I -- the one is, it's a young -- it's a guy.  And he -- he's about twelve or thirteen --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and his parents talk to him -- oh, no.  No, that's the one -- they're in a car, and he's talking about his girlfriend.
L:  Ye- yeah.  I remember that too --
R:  Uh-huh.   And --
L:  -- now that you've said that.
R:  -- of course -- and a mother -- and he -- he says, "Well, she smoked" and then her -- his little brother --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- being the pest that little brothers --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- can be -- "Oh well, she smokes".  Well -- well, she tried it once.  "Well, do you think it's cool?"  "No, I don't; think it's cool".
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  And -- yeah.  And then, when he's out with the gang and they offer him one, he's says, "No thanks".  And that's the two -- [LAUGH] two of the most powerful words in the English language, no thanks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay?
L:   Yep.
R:  I think it's really gonna stand up to any scrutiny.
L:  I think parental involvement is probably the most effective thing to keep people -- keep kids out of it.
R:  Oh, I think so too.
L:  So --
R:  But, for, um -- well, that -- not on- -- well, primarily for smoking, but other things too.  But, particularly smoking.
L:  Exactly.
R:  First example.  Okay, it's very hard to tell your kids not to smoke when you the one -- you know, you -- you know, you're puffing like a chimney.  And --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- number two -- and just talk to them.  Parents do not realise how important they -- ah, many parents don't realise how important they are -- what an influence they are on -- in -- on their children.
L:  Absolutely.  If they just open up that communication from the beginning so that the kids would come to them, instead of going to their friends.
R:  Exactly -- exac- -- 
L:  So, I think that's very -- now, where do you live, Richard?
R:  I live in Philadelphia.
L:  [MN] Okay.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Well, I'm in Ohio.
R:  In Ohio?
L:  Yes.
R:  All right.  Oh well, I've never -- I've never been to Ohio.
L:  Really?
R:  Well, no, but [LAUGH] I --
L:  It's a beautiful state. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm sure that it is.  And I'd certainly like to get out there and find out what your smoking -- anti smoking campaigns are like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] as opposed to the ones [LAUGH] -- ah, because I -- I know here in Philadelphia we have an anti smoking campaign.  Ah, a great deal of it's done with public transportation. [MN]
L:  Okay.
R:  You often see posters on bu- -- on the bus, or --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- subway.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ah, I haven't quite seen as many as I used to see.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I think they're -- they're usually well aimed.
L:  [MN]
R:  And particularly when they swu- situate it right next to, ah, something -- we used to have a lot of poetry.  Um, you know, it would poetry week, and right next to the poetry, um, reading, whatever the selection might be, there would be an anti smoking poster.
L:  Okay.
R:  And that was it.  [inaudible] I --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- thought it was most effective.
L:  Cool.  I don't know that I've ever seen anything like that.
R:  Although, this is -- this is l- --
