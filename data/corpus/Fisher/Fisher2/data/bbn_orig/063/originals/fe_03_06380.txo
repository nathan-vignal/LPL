L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yeah, this is Cindy.
R:  Hi, my name is Gina.
L:  Okay, I'm --
R:  So we're talking about --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Oh, I said we're talking about smoking.
L:  Yes.  How old are you?
R:  I am actually twenty five.
L:  Okay.  I'm --
R:  How old are you.
L:  -- thirty four.
R:  Okay.
L:  You sound really young, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't quite catch all the ...
R:  I think it's just a- -- talking about, um, banning smoking in public places.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I live in California so that's been law for the past five years.
L:  Right, I was going to say, I was out there --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in ninety eight, I think.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it wasn't even allowed in the bars.
R:  Right, right.  I actually think it's a good idea.  Only because I used to go to, like, to clubs before they banned the smoking.  Even though I was a smoker at the time --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- I actually liked it better after they banned it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Only because --
L:  Well, I'm a smoker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm trying to quit. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Again. [LAUGH] And I think that it's a -- probably a good idea.
R:  Yeah, I have to say, my husband and I went back to Michigan, um, back in two thousand, and we actually sat in a restaurant and we couldn't stomach sitting in a restaurant and having smoke in there.
L:  I think it should never be in a restaurant.
R:  Oh, it's disgusting. [LAUGH]
L:  Never.  I just think that is just nasty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm a smoker and I think it's nasty.  I don't smoke in my home or anything now.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I think that maybe some of the bars maybe could -- I think they should have ... I don't know, there should be something to give some of 'em an opportunity to have smoking there or some- -- if people wanted to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- go there and smoke they could.
R:  Right.  I think we have, like, in California I think -- I believe that it's ... if, like, ninety percent of your sales or something come from alcohol, then smoking is allowed.  At least, I think that was the law for the few -- first few years.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then they really cracked down on that.
L:  Okay.
R:  Because we used to have a restaurant where the bar area of the restaurant was smoking and then the rest of the restaurant, which was completely separate, was nonsmoking, but now it's all nonsmoking so ...  I actually think it's a really good idea, only because for people who are nonsmokers, you know, they don't want to smell that where they're ... 'cause when you're in a bar and a lot of people smoke a lot while they drink --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's constant.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, you might as well light up because you're getting [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  And my husband, he comes home -- like, we go out somewhere, he'll come home and he'll be sick for, like, three days because it's, like --
R:  Oh yeah, my husband has --
L:  -- he can't breathe and --
R:  Exa- -- my husband has horrible allergies.
L:  Right.
R:  So when I smoked, that was the one thing that would trigger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the itchy eyes and the runny nose and ...
L:  It drives my husband crazy.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It drives him crazy.  I --
R:  Yeah, he's part of the reason why I quit.  Actually, when I got pregnant I quit.
L:  Well see, I did too but then we actually bought a restaurant a- -- with one side of it a bar --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and one side of it was -- the bar side was smoking and the restaurant side was nonsmoking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I started again, I think from the stress, so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah, well, my husband just left for Iraq in January so I was so tempted.
L:  [MN] Oh, my gosh.
R:  So very tempted.
L:  Is he still there?
R:  Actually, yes.  He should be home, keep my fingers crossed, between Sunday and Thursday of this coming week.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah.  We don't know when.  We'll get twenty four hour notice.
L:  I would start smoking again [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- too.
R:  It's just like, "Whoa, it" --
L:  But it is unhealthy and --
R:  It is.  It is.
L:  But sometimes I think, "Is it too much government?" I mean --
R:  Yeah, no, I really think that it -- you know, I almost worry more about alcohol, in a sense, than I do about smoking because smoking you're damag- -- you're harming yourself.  Although I do drink but, you know, people who would drink and drive and that type of thing are --
L:  Right, and it doesn't stop.
R:  No, and it's a risk to other people.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and -- so maybe banning it to where they have to go outside, you know -- I guess they are risking other people if they're smoking right next to 'em or whatnot but --
L:  Yeah, but there they have a choice to leave, the people that --
R:  Exactly.
L:  But with alcohol --
R:  You know --
L:  -- people who drink and then drive ...
R:  There's no --
L:  The innocent people have no chance.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  And that's just -- that's frightening.
R:  It is, it really is.
L:  And that's -- that's kind of what makes me wonder, "Okay, if they can ban smoking, are they one day going to be able to ban -- are we going back to prohibition?"
R:  Exactly.  You know, it does -- you know, I think there has to be a limit.
L:  And I think the same way about marijuana.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I think it's -- the smell of it disgusts me and it's n- --
R:  Exactly.
L:  But what people do in their own home, I mean ...
R:  Is their business.
L:  Yeah, exactly, and should the government have the right to step in?
R:  Exactly.  I think that if you're in your own home and you have that, you know, that option ...
L:  I think so too.  And -- and there are --
R:  I think it's --
L:  -- a lot of states where it's a misdemeanor rather than ...
R:  Rather -- I know it is here.  It's a misdemeanor rather than a felony.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I used to live in Arizona and I think it was there.  But I live in the Midwest.  I live ch- -- uh, Missouri now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And they're, like ... you know, we're almost in the Bible belt, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I mean, if somebody wears Birkenstocks they're looked at funny so [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Whereas I've kind of put them away 'cause people thought I was something odd.
R:  Yeah, and in California everything like that's just ...
L:  Right, and they did in Arizona too, in Phoenix, so --
R:  Yeah, exactly, there's such a variety in the West --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's very -- very openminded, I have to say.
L:  Yeah, which is not a bad thing and --
R:  Not at all.  No, not at all.  But then they also talked about -- or wanted to know about the smoking prevention ads that are on TV.
L:  Oh.  I think they probably help.
R:  I think they do too, especially maybe for younger kids.  Although my cousins and most teenagers I know still smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As a com- -- you know ...
L:  But maybe it opens a door for the parents to at least talk about --
R:  Yeah, make it more ...
L:  Yeah, I mean, you might be able to say, "Well, you know, what do you think about that?" or ...
R:  Right, 'cause I know --
L:  "Do your friends smoke?" or ... stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  My parents, growing up, my mom smoked and she was just, like, she -- you know, she grew up, you know, in the sixties and seventies and it was okay for her, you know?  At the age of fourteen, fifteen they were smoking, it wasn't a big deal.
L:  Right, exactly.  And if you watch the old sitcoms and ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  People -- I mean, they smoked all the time. [LAUGH]
R:  I love Lucy, she's always [LAUGH] -- you know.
L:  I know. [LAUGH] Exactly.  And I used to do, um -- well, before I got married and had kids I did redecorating for hotels, and when I would go to the East, like, in the Carolinas ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... the bathrooms would always have cigarette burns everywhere [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
L:  ... because, I mean, that's the tobacco --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, states and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's how they make their living, so it would kind of be like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- it'd kind of be like, uh -- it's kind of like PETA is here, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  For us, we -- we raise cattle and hogs and we hate PETA.
R:  Those people are horrible, I have to say, those [LAUGH] people are --
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  -- so horrible. [LAUGH]
L:  But it makes you wonder if the anti-smoking people, are they going to get that extreme.
R:  That bad -- yeah, I know some of the commercials that I've seen -- I know I saw of a -- a premature baby --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that disgusted me because I thought it, ah, really crossed the line.  I mean, it drove the point home, but when you're telling, you know -- when it's aimed at a teenager, they don't real- -- and especially people who haven't had children --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't think it affects them as much as people who have experienced having children.
L:  Right, and I wanna know how people who are pregnant can even smoke, though.  I mean, that is just -- it -- the smell of it made me ill.
R:  It did me too.
L:  [LAUGH] And --
R:  I -- I think for the first two weeks, you know, after I was trying to quit and it just didn't work, and then finally I was just like, "Whoa, this is -- no way".
L:  I know, it's just gross.  It was just gross.  And she was a year old, probably, before I started smoking again, so --
R:  Yeah, I haven't smoked in fo- -- almost -- it will be four years this August, so ...
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  But it's taken everything -- I mean, everyone I know ... you know, my sister in law, my best friend, you know, another friend I have that lives in Georgia, they all quit smoking and they all started smoking again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's been so hard not to just pick up a cigarette and ...
L:  I know, and I -- it's because I enjoy it.  I'll sit down with, like, a Pepsi or a Mountain Dew --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and smoke.  But one of the things is that I have to come out on the deck and -- I don't smoke in the house and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and with the little one, as a two year old, I don't ...
R:  Right.
L:  ... you know, I don't just go out of the house quite as much just to do that unless it's nice and she can play --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- or something.  And now I've kind of noticed that she's watching me more and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of picking up on it.  So I'm thinking, "I really gotta quit because" ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, my sister in law, she usually -- her and my brother hide it from my nephew.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  They'll take turns going outside.
L:  Right.
R:  But I know that -- my mother was over here and she had smoked a cigarette and the next day my daughter goes outside and I said, "Where are you going?"  She goes, "I'm going to go have my cigarette".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I said, "No, no, no" [LAUGH] and I had to sit her down and explain to her that, you know ...
L:  Right.
R:  Because she's almost four and so she picks up on things.
L:  Exactly.  And I am just thinking I have really gotta stop because I don't want her to pretend to do it or --
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  -- anything like that, so --
R:  It's so funny how, you know, we do it to ourselves but you're so protective over our children. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.  I don't want her to do half the things I do. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Neither do I.  [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH] I don't want her to date till she's twenty. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  No, no, no.
L:  [LAUGH] I know that won't happen but ...
R:  Yes.  Ah, it's scary.  It's -- I don't want my daughter to grow up, it's just too scary.
L:  I know.  And smoking is just -- I mean, it's like I watched my dad do it, what he did to himself and yet here I am still ...
R:  Exactly.  I watched my grandfather die of lung cancer and I just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- was still, like, going outside the hospital and having a cigarette.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Because I think that had to do a lot with, though, immaturity.  I mean, I was nineteen so I wasn't really ... I didn't really care.  You know what I mean, you don't really think about ...
L:  Oh, I don't think you think you're going to die until you get older and -- and maybe when you have kids, then you realize, you know, "I may not be here one day for them" and --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I look at my grandmother, who's just turned seventy and smoked her whole life and is as healthy as a horse.  I mean, she's [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, I know, I know people like that and this one guy who lived to be, like, a hundred and one and --
