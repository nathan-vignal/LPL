R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Sonya[?].
L:  My name's Renee[?].
R:  Hi, Renee.  How are you?
L:  Fine.  How are you?
R:  Good thanks.  This is cool, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, this is my first one. [NOISE]
R:  Me too.  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, okay.
L:  Hold on. [NOISE] No, there's no Blues Clues.  Hold on, I'm just playing a video for my dau- -- there's no Blues Clues in there honey.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] No, there's -- oh, it is.  I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Jeeze, I am so sorry.  I just -- I actually just signed up this morning after I saw it on the website.
R:  Well, I did it last night --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and this is really cool.  And, you know, where else can you get this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for, you know, ten minutes.
L:  I know.
R:  It's way cool. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, that's great.
R:  Well, what was the topic?  Smoking, do we think it should [LAUGH] --
L:  Um, smoking -- [several inaudible words] yeah, well I live in Delaware and every place now is non smoking.  You can't smoke in any restaurants or anything.
R:  Really?
L:  Not even the bars, not even the casinos.  Anywhere indoors, non smoking.
R:  And how do you feel about that?
L:  Well, I'm a non smoker but I think that's slightly ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, I'm a non smoker.
L:  I think if you- -- if you're twenty one and you want to go to a bar and you want to smoke, that's okay.
R:  I think part of it though --
L:  Hello?  Go ahead.
R:  Hello?  I'm so sorry.
L:  Yeah, I'm still here.  Sorry.
R:  I know personally for me -- is -- I'm really allergic to smoke --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  -- and I have been in restaurants before where it's supposedly sectioned off, you know smoking [several inaudible words] --
L:  Oh, yeah, that's a joke [several inaudible words] somebody is smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly and you still get that smoke.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  So, for me it's kind of cool that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they --
L:  Well, yeah I agree with the restaurants, but I'm talking about a bar that you can't --
R:  Yeah, a bar you would kind of --
L:  -- if a bar -- if that [inaudible] -- if that bar says I want to be a smoking bar, [several inaudible words] smoking bar that's fine.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  No that, I think, is kind of reli- ridiculous.
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah, they're trying to, but they can't even do that.
R:  They just started -- I'm in Georgia --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and they just started, um, doing -- I don't think everywhere that's inside is non smoking yet --
L:  Well, this is everywhere.
R:  -- but they have started trying to pass those laws.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I don't know how it got passed in Delaware, but it did --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- now all the cas- -- we have a lot of casinos.
R:  You're one of the pioneers, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we were.  We have a bunch of casinos around here and they're all crying foul and I'm like -- well, I walked in -- I went to the casino once, I thought I was going to die.  I opened the front door --
R:  Yeah, the casino I could imagine too be- -- I could say that that's good to have --
L:  I mean, I do have allergies to smoke but I'd -- I'd never been in a place that bad before. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, see that -- that's pretty bad, I --
L:  Yeah, I mean, I -- [inaudible] --
R:  Like you said, a bar where you're going to drink and that kind of thing --
L:  That's what I figure, if you're twenty one and you want to go to a bar and that bar is a smoking bar, fine.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe tha- that's what they should start doing, having --
L:  They've -- they're trying to have like smoking -- they're trying to say it's a club.  If it's a private club you can do what you want --
R:  Okay.
L:  So, bars are trying that and the -- the cops are coming down on that too.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Because I have a friend of mine who works, um, part time at a -- a -- like a bar and they're -- she's lost at least -- they lost at least fifteen, twenty percent of their -- their clientele --
R:  Well, see I don't think that's fair.  I think that if --
L:  Yeah, then they say, "Oh, people weren't losing jobs" and I'm like, "Well, I know at least three -- yeah, a couple of people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that have been ...".  That's --"
R:  No, I think if -- if you already know going in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- this is a smoking bar --
L:  Right.  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- then, you know, you should have that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- choice to go in.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Everybody doesn't want to stay inside the house --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with smoke all of the time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  And you know you can't smoke outs- -- well, I guess you still can smoke outside or are they stopping that too?
L:  Yeah, you can -- you can smoke outside.  They haven't ban- -- I -- as far [several inaudible words] walk ten feet away from the building.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  Because that's what people are doing, they're standing outside and everyone's smoking so you have to --
R:  Yeah, as soon as you walk outside [LAUGH] --
L:  -- walk through them to get inside.
R:  -- it's smacking you in the face. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they have sec- -- now -- well, I understand they're trying to do it as a separate smoking ventilation --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- for smoking.  So, that room is enclosed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, I'm like, "Okay, I'm fine with that as long as it's enclosed". [LAUGH]
R:  It's truly enclosed, exactly.
L:  Encl- -- exactly.
R:  Exactly.  Because --
L:  Exactly.  Truly enclosed.
R:  -- like you said -- like I told you, in the restaurant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have that -- that supposed barrier --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- but there's no barrier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can look right at the person smoking and the smokes coming [LAUGH] --
L:  And so someone said, "Are you in the non smoking section?".
R:  -- right at -- [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, "No".  The person behind me says, "Well, that's the smoking section" --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I'm like, "Well, that's a joke".
R:  Exactly.  So --
L:  Because we went out to eat a couple of weeks ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I say, "In the non smoking section".  She looked at me, she's like, "W- -- everywhere is non smoking" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'm just like, "You're right now.  I keep forgetting".  We don't do -- I have two little kids so we really don't eat in a restaurant much.
R:  Right.  Oh --
L:  But um --
R:  -- you too, huh?
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  I have a nineteen month old and going to a restaurant is a speedy --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- gonzales move --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because if you stay too long he's trying to walk around the whole restaurant and --
L:  Right.  Okay.  See, I have a little he's twenty two months old --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I have a four and a half year old.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, you know -- yeah, that's [several inaudible words] --
R:  Multiply that by two, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God.  Well, she's usually rather good.
R:  So, it doesn't get any better when they get older?
L:  She's -- yeah, she's better.  She just gets tired of sitting there. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good.  Because I was hoping this was just a phase.
L:  Yeah, the- -- yeah, they -- yeah, they're -- as I say, we seem to go to places we already know what we're going to order as soon as we sit down. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's us.
L:  -- and order -- you order your drinks with your food and you're like, "Bring out his food as soon as it's ready". [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  See, we go to like all you can eat places because he's also going through that phase where one minute he likes this and the next minute he can't stand it.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, if we go to a place where you can only get one choice, we always lose money.
L:  Mm.
R:  This way, we -- he has an option to, you know, try different things at different times and hopefully have a full tummy by the end of the day. [LAUGH]
L:  There you go.
R:  The things you have to do to trick em, I guess.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  Wow.  Well, this is cool. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.  When I hear- --
R:  What else can we say about smoking? [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  What else can we say?  Well, like I said, I'm -- you know, I'm kind of glad they did what they did but I think that went a little too far in Delaware.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  They went just a little -- maybe a little overboard.
R:  Yeah, I think definitely they should --
L:  If they just had separate ventilation system --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like I said and a separate room that's fine --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but otherwise, you know, it -- some people say it doesn't cause any problem.  I guess it does, I -- I get problems, my eyes get all red and watery --
R:  Oh, definitely.  I can't stand smoke.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] increased breathing problems.
R:  And, you know, let's not even forget that even people who don't think they're allergic, all the research --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's been done on, you know, second hand smoke and what it can do to you.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Like defi- --
R:  So, I mean --
L:  -- yeah, they increase the chances on ear infections --
R:  Right.
L:  -- bronchitis and my -- ah, little kids have no choice.
R:  See.  Yeah.
L:  You're going to a bar and -- you know, you're going to a restaurant and the bar -- [several inaudible words] the bars in the middle and the restaurant is all around it.  I always got a kick out of this. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  You're sitting next to the bar, that's non smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I -- I think -- I think it's very beneficial for the people who don't smoke and hopefully it will also encourage people who do smoke to stop --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know?  Because it's just too much of a pain.  I think that's where they're trying to go, they're trying to really force you without forcing you, to say, "You really should stop smoking".  "If we had our way, we wouldn't even sell you cigarettes", you know?
L:  Yeah, but then they use the taxes to do stuff with though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's a no win situation. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  No.
R:  I'm just glad it's a habit I never picked up on, because --
L:  Oh, I -- I tried smoking once and I -- I almost threw up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not -- I -- that's what -- I don't even see how people can smoke because of the taste it leaves in your mouth --
L:  Oh, it's nasty.  I went out -- yeah.
R:  -- and, "Ooh".
L:  Yeah, I went out with someone who smoked once and I made him brush his teeth before I kissed him, because it was just so disgusting.
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  He got offended.  I'm like, "I'm sorry, but that is just gross".
R:  [LAUGH] That's right.  And then it turns your fingers colored.  Have -- have you ever looked at people who've smoked for a long period of time?
L:  Oh, their fingers, their face, their skin --
R:  Yeah, their teeth.
L:  -- their teeth.
R:  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.
L:  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.
R:  Their lips and everything I --
L:  My mother in law smokes, we go to visit her -- she's not allowed to smoke inside, but it's in the house, it's in the room.
R:  Right and it's in your clothes.
L:  As soon as I get home, I have to wash every single thing I took down there.
R:  That's right.  That's right, because it's just in their pores after awhile and --
L:  Oh, it's disgusting.
R:  -- and you can tell when somebody smokes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even if they're not, you know, using a cigarette --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lighting up at the time, you can just look --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- at em and tell.
L:  Yep.
R:  And I just don't see cosmetically even how -- why you would want to get addicted like that.
L:  No, my mother in law's like seventy years old and you can tell.
R:  Yeah.  See, that's gross.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh.  Ooh.  And probably will tell you she's been smoking for like fifty five years. [LAUGH]
L:  No, she's just like -- she says, "I've tried everything to quit smoking.  I just can't".  I'm like, "Yeah, you run the risk --" -- she was in the hospital for two weeks and th- -- yeah, pretty much over the time it's going to take you to quit --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as soon as she got home her -- her daughter took her pack of cigarettes and put it away and she -- she went in her room and got another packet and started smoking again.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I'm like, "Well, that's just stupid".
R:  Did she even try the patch?
L:  Sh- -- oh, yes.
R:  Do those things work?
L:  Well, she can't try the patch because it'll -- affects her medication.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  And I'm like, "Well, what do you think smoking does to all the medication --"
R:  Ah, yeah the nicotine and everything in it.
L:  -- you're taking?".  She has asthma, she has emphysema from the smoking of course --"
R:  Oh, I was going to say, she's not getting that that's coming from the smoking? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She wouldn't even have to take medication if she would just stop with the cigarettes, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you.  Thank you.  There are a lot of things she probably wouldn't have to take.
R:  That's right.
L:  She's like, "I'm having trouble breathing, I'm on oxygen twenty four hours a day" now she's on steroids --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because she's having trouble breathing.  I'm like --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  I'm like "Yeah" -- I wanted to say, "Yeah, you quit smoking?" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Oh, I can't quit".
R:  Imagine what would happen if that happened --
L:  Oh, God --
R:  -- if you stopped smoking.
L:  -- she gives her- -- he -- she has to give herself treatment so she can breathe.
R:  Oh, my goodness gracious.
L:  Right after she smokes, she takes the oxygen off and runs to the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she runs outside and it's to smoke.
R:  You know that's like a cartoon. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, " [several inaudible words] I hope every time --" [LAUGH]
R:  I can see somebody giving themselves a breathing treatment and then --
L:  Or -- and after she -- no, after she smokes.
R:  -- rushing out for a cigarette. [LAUGH]
L:  After she smokes, she comes in --
R:  Oh, after she smokes [several inaudible words] breathing treatment? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Now, that's crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  No, she -- she is.  She's insane.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Yes, that's crazy.
R:  Oh, I can't even imagine that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That is hilarious. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- it is -- it is hilarious.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm just like, "Okay".  She has a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not only has one of those little breathing treatments that plug into the wall and has the steam, she also has the inhalers.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  She goes -- she just -- she has the whole -- she has all of it, everything.
R:  And just imagine how much money should would save --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's why she wants the -- ah, she's a senior, so she wants us to pay for her medicine.
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  I'm like, "Why should I pay for your medicine because you smoked and drank all these years?". [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Uh-uh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  This is --
L:  "Oh, you should pay for me be- --".  I'm like, "No, why should I pay for your medicine?".
R:  No.  No.  You are fortunate --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- enough to not have that habit -- something you won't have to pay for --
L:  Exactly.  Why should I pay for what --
R:  -- why should you -- that's right.
L:  Exactly.  And why should my money --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- tax payer money go --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to pay for your medicine because you've done this to yourself all your life?
R:  That's right.  But you know I do think it's good too -- what would be good is if they raised the taxes on cigarettes.  Anything that would deter or --
L:  Oh, that's right.  I think in New York it's going to cost like eight bucks now for a pack of cigarettes.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, now it's a big black market.
R:  What?  And they
