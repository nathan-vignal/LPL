L:  Hi, I'm Rebecca from Colorado.
R:  Hi, I'm Cressa from New Jersey.
L:  It's nice to meet you.
R:  You too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Is this the first one you've done?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Me too --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I'm scared. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Me too.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  I --
L:  Now we got that over with, we're safe. [LAUGH]
R:  I was kind of hoping for not such a controversial topic, but -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I'm like, "Ooh, man". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you a smoker?
R:  No, I'm not.
L:  Neither am I.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  Neither one of us is going to eat the other one alive. [LAUGH]
R:  That's good at least. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think that education programs help?
R:  Um, I -- I think they probably have a pretty minimal effect.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I mean, I think usually when they're ads and things like that they're pretty catchy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't think as far as, like, stopping smokers when they're younger, I don't really think that they're that effective.
L:  I don't think so either.  I have a niece that is, like, twenty four and she smokes.  And I show her the pictures of, like, the shriveled, black, cancer lungs and she's like, "Yeah, I know".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] "But you don't care, that's the problem". [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, how do you feel about banning smoking in public places?
R:  Well, I personally like it, just for the fact -- like, I'm right across the river from New York and they recently, um, banned all the smoking in restaurants and bars.
L:  That's great.
R:  And I know much more -- I'd be much more likely to go out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and especially my husband too, because he will not go out to a bar with our friends, basically because he doesn't really drink and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he hates the smoke, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, that, you know, makes it a lot more enjoyable for the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people who don't smoke because that really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kept me away.
L:  I just hate -- I hate it that I smell like it when I come home.
R:  Yep, that's the worst part. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And I hate it -- to smell it on my kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like, I don't know, "That's in your little bitty lungs". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yes, I could --
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  No, I don't, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I know I would feel [LAUGH] the same way --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Does your husband -- your husband obviously doesn't smoke, then.
R:  No.  No, not at all.
L:  Neither does mine, thank God. [LAUGH]
R:  And actually, most of my friends don't smoke now either.  I do have, like, friends who smoked in the past but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they've basically quit [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Yeah.  I remember growing up that my dad was, like, always smoking.  My mom always had a migraine headache. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  I'm like [LAUGH], "Mm, do you think they were related, baby?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well actually, my dad smoked too, and actually he died from it because --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- um, it -- it was -- it made heart problems.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, he a- -- always, like, tried to quit, and he would never even smoke in the house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he would always, like, smoke outside.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, it's ... you know, that -- for -- definitely for that reason I would, you know --
L:  S- -- yikes.
R:  -- not smoke.  'Cause in college, you know, I smoked, you know, oh, some but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not a lot just, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it was the cool thing to do, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 'Cause it was cool. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But you outgrew it. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  So ...
L:  But I never did 'cause I had asthma when I was a little kid --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and that was, like, that same tight asthma attack kind of feeling in my chest.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm like, "Oh, I don't need to pay to do this".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- I -- I would -- like it when people don't smoke in a restaurant.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't know that it needs to be every restaurant everywhere, but it would be nice if some were just declared off limits and then we could pick those.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Or if it -- you know, well, if there is a restaurant, I mean, if they want to have a smoking section, that's fine, but I like it better, like, when it's enclosed and there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a door, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rather than, you know --
L:  Some --
R:  -- just neck.  I think it's more regulated now that they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there has to be some type of partition.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I know in the past I've been someplace where, like, the smoking section stops where the nonsmoking begins so it's just --
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's exactly what I was thinking.  It's like they're sitting right next to you. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're thinking, "You don't have separate ventilation.  I'm still breathing this crap".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Where did you hear about this project from?
R:  Um, uh, online.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's a website RMC.
L:  Yes!
R:  You did too?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was going to ask you that too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm like --
R:  I think, like, everybody probably from the --
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I'm like, "Do I ask, do I not ask?" [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's -- I was thinking the same thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, funny, my husband says, "I cannot believe you have found a way to talk on the phone and make money". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, "Hey, baby, don't mock it". [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, that's the perfect thing to do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, it is.  I love that website.
R:  Yeah, I do too.  I'm on it constantly, so --
L:  I am too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I always talk about it like it's -- I -- like, a neighbor or my best friend, and my husband's like, "Whatever.  [LAUGH] As long as it doesn't cost any money [LAUGH], it's fine". [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  My husband -- well, he says, "How did you know about that?" and it's always, "My website. [LAUGH] My website, of course".
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.  That's what I say.  "It's my site".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  "It's from my site" [LAUGH] I guess [inaudible] one today it was that, um ... I can't even think, it was like Avantis[?] and it was a relaxation kit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you get that one?
R:  No, I don't think so.
L:  It just -- I think I sent away for it a long time ago but it was, like, a journal and a pen and a --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- back massager and a face mask.
R:  Wow.
L:  I'm like, "This is the coolest free thing I ever got". [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, that does sound cool.  I hope I get that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Oh, but --
R:  But I know sometimes -- I don't know if it's my post office but I know once in a while, like, I'll send for something for both myself and my mom --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she'll get it and I won't.
L:  That's weird.
R:  So like, I even have something on my desk she got.  This really -- it's, like, from Renova[?].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It had all these little sample sizes of, like, about fifteen different little trials and I'm like --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  "I never got that" but --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- she didn't want hers so she gave it to me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah like, "Wait a minute ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lot of the things I don't get in on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like ... but it's all right 'cause I get in on some.
R:  Mhm, as long as it's some it's ...
L:  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
R:  ... it's worth the time.
L:  How funny.  I was like, "I wonder, uh, should I ask?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The --
L:  The people who are monitoring this, uh, they get, "Okay, smoking".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "You're supposed to be talking about smoking". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Ah ...
L:  How funny, well, ah --
R:  It --
L:  It's like talking to a friend --
R:  Isn't it?
L:  -- now that we know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'll have to k- -- watch out for your name now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Rebecca from Colorado.
L:  Yeah, Rebecca from Colorado.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think there's a couple of Rebeccas but --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm the only Cressa from New Jersey, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, now I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do y- -- have you lived there your whole life?
R:  No, I've lived here only about, um, ten years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  About ten, eleven.  I'm from Minnesota originally.
L:  You had the kind of Minnesota "about" ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  That's, like, the one word I still stick with.  And I just went back to visit, like, about two weeks ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, um, it comes back.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's so funny, I never noticed it growing up but now I notice it all the time, especially when I'm at work and I say it and I'm like, "Ooh". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, I sound almost Canadian and [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] It's funny how things like that just come out. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  It's like, "Okay".
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's the real me, love it anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you do?
R:  Um, I w- -- I am a customer service manager.
L:  Oh, cool, for ...?
R:  Yeah.  For McArthur[?].
L:  Ooh, cool.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  So you get to see all the pretty stuff.
R:  Yeah, I do.  And what do you do?
L:  I'm a homemaker.
R:  Oh, okay, that's what I wanna do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] You've got some years left. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So --
L:  I have a tiny, tiny business selling books -- uh, fun books.  They're p- -- kids books mostly.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH] And, um, it's just a tiny bit of money.  Mostly I'm just a mommy.
R:  Oh, well that's -- that's a great thing to do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, that's, like, my goal.  Everyone always says like, "You wanna work or what do you want to do?"  Well, I don't want to work any more, what I want is have kids and stay home.  So ...
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Are you guys, um ...
R:  Trying. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you, like, have the long l- -- long range plan of, "In a couple of years we're going to do this" or ...?
R:  Well, hopefully as soon as possible, actually, right now.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  We're, like, we're ready for the kids so ...
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's so cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What does your husband do?
R:  Um, he is a technical analyst.  He's, like, a computer geek [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, cool. [LAUGH]
R:  -- for a financial software company, so --
L:  The world needs the computer geeks, they keep the world running.
R:  Yep, they do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he loves it so that's a good thing.  He loves his job so --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- he wants to work forever, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, like, this is so cool --
R:  He can do that.
L:  "I get to stay home, you can work". [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  How funny.
R:  That's the best way.
L:  But then --
R:  So, what does your husband do?
L:  They -- he prints phone books, actually.
R:  Oh, that's interesting. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] It's like, "Hm, that's a new one".  But, um, it's a -- enormous, like, worldwide company --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that prints phone books.  It's called R.R. Donnelley.  I think they print the, um, Reader's Digest too, but --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- where he works they just do phone books.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That -- 'cause that company name sounds familiar to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I didn't know what it was.
L:  I noticed the other day on something I got in the mail that it said, "R.R. Donnelley Shipping" and I'm thinking, "Where the heck did that come in?" but who knows.
R:  Hm.
L:  I don't know, but I know they don't make cigarettes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's -- that's good.  You know, my company -- my husband's company don't make cigarettes either --
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  -- so ... but that's even --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- another thing, like, at work, there are so many people who, like, need to take their cigarette breaks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's kind of considered almost acceptable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, to have, besides, like, your regular break, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have to have your cigarette break.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's, like, so unfair to all those other people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who don't smoke.
L:  The ones that are working [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  -- when everybody else is smoking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, that always -- I worked for State Farm before I had my kids and it was, like, the big thing, "Oh, I gotta smoke, I gotta smoke".  I'm like, "Jeeze, yuk".
R:  Yeah.  It's like everyone else should get, like, fresh air breaks to compensate for the smokers' smoking breaks.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] "I gotta go get a antismog break".
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  How funny.  Um, do you know -- like, do the patches and the pills and all that work?
R:  I have no idea. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't either. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  I never started 'cause I -- I'm such, like, a chocolate addict.  I just thought I would never, ever, ever stop once I got started.  So --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it depends for some people, you know ... I don't know how some people get more addicted then others seem to be able to just stop, so ...
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It might be how some --
