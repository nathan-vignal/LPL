L:  Good morning.
R:  Hi, good morning.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Lucy.  How are you?
L:  Hi, Lucy, I'm fine.  I'm Clementine from Mount Vernon, New York.
R:  Oh, Mount Vernon, New York.  I'm in New York City, Manhattan.  Where -- where --
L:  Oh, hoo, first one I had all the way [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, where is Mount Vernon?
L:  It's in Westchester County.
R:  Oh, okay.  My office used -- well, one of the offices of this company that I used to work for was in Rye --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- which is in Westchester.  Oh, so w- -- how do you think people would react in the event --
L:  Well, I know they would panic. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- used to work right across from the World Trade Center, like, directly across from Seven World Trade so --
L:  And you saw extreme panic.  Did you witness it?
R:  Actually, by then I wasn't working there --
L:  Thank God.
R:  -- any more.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, I know, um --
L:  But, you know, in crowded situations it'll -- like, any, uh, community where there are lots of people, [LAUGH] you know, just even a -- everyday street, if a disaster comes out, even -- I -- I can recall years ago when they had the air raid drills and the air raids would go off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [MN].  People would start running.  "Oh, I'm getting home, I'm getting home, I'm getting home".  They would just literally start running or getting off the street --
R:  Yeah, it's hard --
L:  -- rather than walking calmly and being aware and saying, "Oh, it's just -- it's an air raid, I don't know if it's right or not but just let me go on my way and do what I gotta do".  No, they started walking very briskly and some of them running and, "Oh, what are we supposed to do, what are we supposed to do?" panicking.  So I would think that if Saddam Hussein or anyone came here [LAUGH] today and --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- set off any kind of panic or a bomb, uh, if the- -- 'cause they had them bomb scares, people do panic.  And during an actual attack, they will run, push, shove, kick and h- -- and hurt.  I -- I believe that.  What's your opinion about it?
R:  Yeah, I think the first thing people would do is to, uh, automatically panic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, that's because -- that's how we're wired to respond when something --
L:  Yeah, that's human nature.
R:  Yeah, when a crisis like that strikes.  Each --
L:  Even at a football game.
R:  Yeah, or a soccer game, yeah, you're right.
L:  Soccer game, anything, you know.
R:  In Europe people -- yeah, people get trampled on and die.
L:  Oh, goodness, so disastrous.
R:  Did you hear about the bombing at Yale Law School yesterday?
L:  No.
R:  You didn't?
L:  Gi- -- no, I didn't.  I didn't have on my radio at all, I was trying to --
R:  Oh, my God, I read --
L:  -- get some paperwork done.
R:  -- I read, um, in the newspaper and also I heard on the radio this morning that yesterday at the Yale Law School a bomb went off and it destroyed this --
L:  It went off.
R:  -- one classroom that was empty --
L:  Oh, thank the Lord.
R:  -- on the first floor.  Yeah, that's why I'm thinking it might have been, you know, like, an inside job or something.  I don't --
L:  I think so --
R:  But it was --
L:  -- 'cause they targeted that area.
R:  But that timing, the timing was so, um ... so uncanny because I think just on Monday or, like, earlier this week --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is when the g- -- Federal Government raised the alert to orange, for the whole country.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, that happened ... when did that happen?  That just -- that happened at --
L:  You said yesterday, right?
R:  Hm?
L:  Uh, when they raised the, uh, orange?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Monday?
R:  Was it Monday?
L:  I think it was.  It was th- -- it was this week.
R:  Or Tu- -- okay, and then the explosion happened at Yale yesterday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Wednesday.  Yeah, right aft- -- almost right afterwards.
L:  Yes.
R:  That's very --
L:  And you know, um, I -- I also know, like, during -- and during school, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] at school times when they have a bomb scare, the students panic.  The chatter begins.  "Somebody put a bomb in here, somebody put a bomb."  "Where, where?"  "I don't know."  "There's others in the cafeteria."  "Really?  I'm not going over there."  And they start running the other way.  "Come on, hurry up, hurry up".  And they start rushing each other along, even -- and, um, security are busy pulling them out of the way, telling everyone to go in one direction, go out this way, go out that way, walk but don't run.  People start running, trying to catch up with their friends, trying to find their family members.
R:  Mm.
L:  I would think that it's a natural reaction just to panic.  I believe I would panic.  I think that ... well, I'm -- I'm a ... a -- emotional --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but calm natured person, so to speak.
R:  Seem, yeah, I know what you --
L:  Um, I try to be very mature in my attitude.  I wanna walk and get out quickly if I can, but before I -- I become trampled, I'm running. [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, 'cause it's --
L:  Or I will try to stand up against the wall or something, trying to find my way out as quickly as possible.  I'm cautious when I enter different places.  I like to look for the ex- exits first.  I have a thing about that, I don't know why but, um ...
R:  I th- -- well --
L:  ... I don't wanna get caught up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's -- I -- I think that's a very smart idea to do.  I -- I o- -- like -- uh, I should do more of that to find the exit.
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  Find [inaudible] yeah.
L:  -- the first thing I do when I go in.  I -- oh, I find my bathroom and I find the exit.
R:  Yeah, I don't think to do that, but I should.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  'Cause I am getting out if I can.  Now, um, I live in a highrise apartment --
R:  Mhm, so do I.
L:  -- uh, building.  And there's only one way out. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  There's only one staircase?  A --
L:  No, one way out of the door.  I'm on the top, I'm on the tenth floor.
R:  Oh, oh --
L:  Well, I've spent so many years on top.
R:  -- on your floor.
L:  And, uh, if there, uh, if there were a fire --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and if it were in my living room and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I was in the bedroom, I'd have to go through that fire to get out the door.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I'm not jumping out the window.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay?  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's good that you thought about that.  Yeah, I didn't even think about that for my building.  I'm in a -- I'm in a highrise too.
L:  Mhm.  Now --
R:  And I'm on the sixth floor but there are multiple exits.  Well, there are multiple staircases.
L:  But can you get out of your door?
R:  My door?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um --
L:  In your apartment --
R:  Yeah, there's on- --
L:  -- do you have two exits?
R:  No, there's only one door.
L:  Okay, so you --
R:  Yeah, most New York apa- -- most apartments --
L:  -- have the same problem as I.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, most people have that problem.  Unless they have, like, two apartments that they combine.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Then they'll have two exits.
L:  Tell me, do you have a sprinkler system?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, you d- --
R:  Yeah, do you?
L:  Yeah, I have it now.  I just relocated after fifty three years in one apartment; I moved over to the [SIGH] next building because they're refurbishing our apartment.  Supposed to be renovating, but however -- whatever they are doing at this junkle -- junky jungle mess. [LAUGH] You know, needless to say I'm not happy.  I worry now about flooding.
R:  Oh, w- -- i- is --
L:  I'm gonna panic.
R:  Are- aren't sprinklers required by law though?
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- I thought every -- yeah, every building had -- every, uh ... uh ...
L:  Highrise.
R:  ... room had to have it -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, this is the new thing so this is part of the renovation, to have these sprinklers.  And I'm afraid now that if the water goes off everything in my apartment's going to be damaged.  I can't afford water insurance, I can't afford any of that, I -- you know, it ... how am I going to get through all the water?  You know, suppose I fall.  I have multiple sclerosis.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I -- I -- I have a lot to worry about and, um --
R:  But why would you be worried about a f- -- a flood though?  The sprinkler would only go off in --
L:  Fire, heat.
R:  -- the case of an actual fire.
L:  Well, you know --
R:  But if there's no fire it wouldn't go off accidentally and flood anything.
L:  Well, I don't know.  The way this place is constructed ... I -- I don't like it, number one, but everything is built up, um -- in the closets they have a sprinkl- -- why would they have a sprinkler inside of a closet?
R:  Oh, I have that too.
L:  You too!
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  What the hell are they going to do in a closet?
R:  You know, like, little fires can start.  Like, if they do a l- -- a lot of wiring is done through the closet --
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  -- so if anything happens to that wiring --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it could set your clothes or books -- like, people --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- store things that they don't use often.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, that stuff catches on fire quickly because it's so tightly packed in, in closets.  There was a --
L:  Well, I was told -- I'm sorry to cut you off.
R:  Oh, oh, no problem.
L:  Go on.
R:  Oh, so if the wiring does go, like, does get cut or something --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's likely to happen in the closet, 'cause the closet has a lot of wires running through it and closets tend to be packed with a lot of stuff that's combustible so --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- maybe that's why they put a sprinkler in there.
L:  Possibly.  But, w-, um, it can also go off just with things touching it.  Um, I don't like the space I have because it's too narrow, doesn't hold enough boxes and you can't touch the sprinkler system.  I have a box that sticks out that's in the way and if the box touches the sprinkler it's going to go off automatically and it's going to put water all through your apartment.
R:  Oh, so the sprinkler goes off by tou- -- motion, not --
L:  It -- yes, it --
R:  -- by temperature?
L:  I- -- motion and temperature.
R:  'Cause mine only go off --
L:  By motion and temperature, oh yes.
R:  Oh, are they electronic?  'Cause my --
L:  Yes, they're --
R:  -- my sprinklers only go off if, uh, heat rises.
L:  Well, these are d- -- my -- our sprinklers are too sensitive and I think they're --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- too close or whatever, because I can just be making a normal breakfast and, " [MN], [MN], [MN]" the thing --
R:  Oh, you're kidding me.
L:  B- -- oh, it scares me half to death.  The first time, when I first moved here, I was running.  Now, this is panic city, me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Will I panic during an attack or anything?  I probably would.  Soon as I heard that thing I was on my way out the door.  And then I realized, "Oh, it's an alarm, let me go see". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you should tell your super- --
L:  You know, this is what they're -- the six months.
R:  'Cause I'm sure if you have that problem other people --
L:  Oh, other people do.
R:  -- have that problem.
L:  Oh, other people do.  We have complained but --
R:  And --
L:  -- no one is doing anything.
R:  The landlord doesn't do anything.
L:  No, it's just a [inaudible].  They said, "You'll get over it".  So what's ended up happening is that people have found that circuit breaker, wouldn't -- one which, um, controls these, um, alarms.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's detrimental but who wants to be annoyed five or six times a day by that alarm?
R:  Oh, is that how often the alarm go- -- accidentally goes off every day?
L:  Uh -- yes.
R:  Oh, my God, what a pain.
L:  In everybody's apartment.  So now I'm hearing --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- them less and less, and that's because people know what button to push on the circuit breaker to cut it off.  Now, that may do more harm than good to us.  Are we hurting ourselves?  Are we helping ourselves?
R:  Are they p- -- turning it back on after they ...?
L:  I don't know what they are doing, but I forget to turn mine back on.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know what I'm saying?  So --
R:  Yeah, you should just put a little reminder, like, on your door, you know, before you leave, to turn the ... uh --
L:  Circuit --
