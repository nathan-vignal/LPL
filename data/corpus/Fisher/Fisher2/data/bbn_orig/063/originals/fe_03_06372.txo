R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name is Judy.
L:  Hi, my name's Tim.
R:  Um ... [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] About smoking.  Um, first of all, I am not a smoker.  Are you?
L:  No.  No, I'm not a smoker at all.  Um, but I do l- live in the tobacco -- the so called tobacco belt, so [LAUGH] it's -- it's --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.  It's, uh --
R:  Um, are you exposed to any, like, secondhand smoke?
L:  No.  Um, my -- my workplace is pretty much smoke free and ... there are some smokers there but they are -- they go outside and -- and smoke.  But, uh, I think it's helped curtail smoking a little bit because, um, whereas people would light up fairly regular if they could smoke in their workplace, now that they have to stop and go outside or something like that --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- um, it -- it sort of cuts down on it.
R:  Right.  I have asthma so I'm really sensitive to smoking, and I guess they wanna know how we felt about, um, banning smoking completely in public places.  Um, you know, having asthma myself and other lung problems, I guess I'm -- I'm definitely for it because it affects my health and, uh, you know, I think it can do a lot of damage to people physically.  At the same time I also [SIGH] feel somewhat, um, bad for smokers because I guess the only place they'll be able to smoke is in their own homes.
L:  Right.  Well, y- you know, I -- I agree with you in some respects but it depends on the public place.  I mean, if it's -- if it's outside or something like that, I don't -- don't see that it's a problem, you know, in the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the open, but --
R:  Right, no.
L:  -- but, you know, in a bar or -- or somewhere like that I can understand and don't have any problems with it.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, t- to put a blanket ban -- I know, um, in our area, um, you know, being that we're in an area -- I mean, Philip Morris's manufacturing plant is about three miles from my house --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and there's a lot of people that work there and support the community and everything.
R:  Mm.
L:  And for something like an athletic event or something, at, like, a local hospital, like, a football game or something like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, smoking's banned, totally.
R:  Oh, it is?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, I d- -- I don't understand the problem when it's outside.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really don't -- like, uh, the local hospital that I go to, they are starting a ban where people cannot smoke outside, in the parking lots, even in their own cars on the grounds.  And I don't think that that's fair because especially when you're at a hospital you could be under a lot of stress if you had a loved one, you know, who is sick or having surgery, and I think they should be able to go outside and smoke to relieve their tension.
L:  Yeah.  But it --
R:  But --
L:  -- it's just -- you know, it's like the -- the football games.  I mean, [MN] Philip Morris, you know, they -- they contribute a lot to the community and I can understand that, but, i- -- for somebody that's -- their grandparents are coming and they've been smoking for twenty or thirty years and -- and don't have any intentions of quitting and -- and they're coming to see their grandchild play football or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or perform or something like that.  [MN] Sitting in the stands or -- you know, even if they had an area that they could go to and smoke.  But, I mean, it's totally banned.  And --
R:  Yeah, I don't agree with that.  I don't think that that's fair.
L:  And, uh, [MN] you know, I've seen -- [MN] it's getting kind of bad in some respects that -- I've seen police officers escort older people out because they were trying to smoke.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And, uh, you know, [MN] that's -- that's going a little bit overboard, I think.  I mean --
R:  It is.
L:  -- if they had an area -- I mean, you know, we're talking about a football stadium that there's plenty of areas that they could set aside a little area and -- and say, "Well, you can smoke but you need to smoke here --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and away from everybody else".  And I don't think that that should cause a big problem, but evidently the powers to be don't -- don't see it that way.
R:  Wow, and they really had police officers escort them off.  That -- that seems like a violation of a person's rights.
L:  But, uh, you know, it --
R:  It's going too far.  And what did they wanna know about, ah, ads?  If the ads that we see [SIGH] affect us, was that it?
L:  I think it was, yeah.
R:  I couldn't hear really good in the beginning.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, how -- how do they affect you?
L:  Well, I mean, [MN] we don't see that many ads here.  I mean, there's a -- a few, uh, you know, negative ads as far as stop smoking and things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh -- but as far as ads, I mean, they don't affect me.  R- really and truly they don't affect me one way or the other.  Ah --
R:  I, ah, I -- I see quite a few ads in magazines and a few on television.  And I listen to them and I'm interested in the information, uh ... I mean, I would just never smoke because of my -- my health problems so I guess ... it -- it doe- -- it is though informative about the damage that it can do to a person but personally I've already made my decision so the ads don't affect me either.
L:  Right.  And I think some of the ads, especially some of the negative ads, um, [MN] they -- they get a little overboard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and, you know, I know it's a point that needs to be made but [MN] they could make it a little bit differently.  I mean, ah, as far as the reports and everything that the tobacco companies had twenty years ago, I mean, I don't think that's any big secret that they had those reports, um, and they've pretty well publicized that for that past, I guess, seven or eight years, that they knew what the effects of smoking was and that, uh --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- they actually laced them, laced cigarettes with, uh, a nicotine additive to -- to make it more addictive.
R:  Right.  Right.  Now, those, um, those advertisements really did surprise me because I hadn't been aware of that, so, you know, I was -- I was shocked and I ... I was shocked but I can't say I was surprised.
L:  Right.  But, uh --
R:  And I -- I was -- I was saddened too because so many people do have a problem with tobacco and it is very addictive and I'm -- I have family members that can't quit smoking, it's very difficult for them so ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... it's a big problem.
L:  You know, and I understand that too but, you know, I grew up in an area where the predominant crop, uh, and income for that area was tobacco.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the two things that were driving the community were tobacco and textiles.
R:  Yep.
L:  And tobacco's being phased out and the textile plants are shutting down left and right and there's -- there's nothing for the people to do.  And it's, uh --
R:  Yeah, that's a big problem, with the economy as bad as -- as it is anyway.
L:  Yeah.  But it just, uh, I don't know, it -- it makes you wonder if it ... [MN] they shouldn't jerk the rug out from under these people that are -- that are tobacco farmers and everything, they should kind of gradually help 'em get into some other, uh, cash crop to -- to support the economy in an area.  But --
R:  Yeah, I agree with that because they -- they need to have a way to make a living.
L:  And, um, you know, 'cause they've got so much open farmland and -- and things that they've devoted to farming tobacco and, uh, tobacco, um, it's very hard on acreage.  I mean, it ... [MN] you have to rotate your tobacco crops because --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because [MN] after one or two growing seasons of tobacco, the -- the ground is just drained.  I mean, [MN] it's not really productive for tobacco again for another two or three seasons, they have to grow, um ... what they -- I guess they call them over crops, you know, they grow weed or straw or --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- or something like that on it for about two seasons and -- and really fertilize it and try to bring it back to where it was to be able to have tobacco again.
R:  So, does the tobacco deplete the soil of minerals and ... and --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- nutrients, is that the --
L:  Nutrients and --
R:  -- the way it works?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh --
L:  Because it's really intensive.
R:  -- I didn't know that.
L:  Um, it -- it's hard to ... to -- to grow tobacco on the same acreage year after year and not just simply burn the land out.
R:  Right.  Did they ask us anything else to talk about, regarding the tobacco?
L:  No, I don't ...
R:  It was -- it was basically the advertisements and ... and the public ban on -- on smoking.
L:  On smoking, yeah.  I think that was -- that was about it.
R:  Okay. [SIGH] Oh, my goodness.
L:  But, uh ...
R:  Yeah, I was really shocked when -- when I got the letter about the --
