L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Cassandra, how are you?
R:  Yeah, hi, Cassandra.  My name's Tommy Di Micco[?], how are you?
L:  I'm good, I'm good.
R:  Good.  Yeah, I'm just on my way home, I just got my first call here.  I missed it, I called it back.
L:  Oh did you?  That's so funny because I had missed a couple of calls on the weekend, and so I thought, "Well let me call them and get my third --" this is my third call, so I said, "Let me call and see if I can get a call in today".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, how many can you do?
L:  I think you can do up to three per phone number.
R:  Oh yeah, that's right.
L:  So you could have several different phone numbers, for up to three per number, I think.
R:  That's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so I'm just on my way home, I thought now would be an opportune time.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, the topic of the days is, how do you feel about smoking in public places, was it?
R:  Yeah.  Smoking.  It's funny, I just lit one up, I'm smoking one now.
L:  Oh my good- [LAUGH]!
R:  And I'm loving every bit of it.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It was funny, when I heard it I was just sparking up, I started laughing to myself.
L:  Oh my goodness, that's too funny.  Well, I don't ha- -- I -- my -- I, myself, I don't smoke, but I don't have a problem with people smoking.  The only place that, um, the only time that I have a problem with people smoking is if, for whatever reason, they -- say you go to a restaurant and the smoking section is full and you end up getting a non smoking section, and then you have those full people that know they're in non smoking, but then they wanna smoke there.  But other than that --
R:  I don't p- --
L:  -- it doesn't bother me.
R:  [MN] I don't particularly care for it if I'm trying to eat.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So, other than that, yeah, I'm all for it, and that's, uh --
L:  Yeah, I'm all for it, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just don't blow it in my face.
R:  Yeah, right --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's pretty rude.  That's really rude anyhow.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But you have some people that just really get, uh, you know, all and out ugly about it, but it doesn't bother me.
R:  You know what's really funny?
L:  What's that?
R:  Is that I used to be one of those people.
L:  Really?
R:  For the longest.  I mean, growing up, I never smoked.  Everybody round me smoked --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- everybody I knew smoked.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Everybody in my family smoked.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Even my younger brother smoked.
L:  Oh my goodness!
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- and I hated it, and I was always knocking 'em out of people's mouths and, you know, "Get that thing away from me" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- especially smoke in my cars, 'cause I used to keep my cars nice.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And then I started smoking like, at twenty four, I'm thirty now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I just started smoking maybe five years ago.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  Yeah, can you believe that?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and I've -- I've never smoked.  You -- well, you know, um, in my younger days when I go out and -- and party, whatever I drink just, uh, I'll smoke while I'm drinking, just trying to play the part, but as actually smoking, smoking, and buying cigarettes, I -- I've never done that.  Mhm.
R:  Y- yeah, I kinda like it now.  It's weird, because --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like I said, I was so against it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- before, but now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just, you know, I kind of enjoy it, man --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's weird.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, as far as, you know, not being able to smoke in public places, I've -- you know, I've been out to California a few times --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- over the last few years, and every time I go out there, you know, you can't smoke anywhere out there.
L:  Yeah, that's what I heard, that's what I heard.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And it's getting to be more and more that way.
R:  Yeah, well, New York's the same way now.  That law just passed this year.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  But California's been like that for like, three years now.
L:  Whoa!
R:  And I -- and I -- you know, I go there, you know, once a year at least.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  It's, uh, yeah, all the -- all outside the nightclubs, all outside the restaurants, or any public building, ev- -- just like, there's a million people standing on the sidewalk --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with this [inaudible] tray.  Big giant ashtray [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Really.  I see a lotta places now, they have these big planters as ashtrays!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's what it is like, you know, those giant office buildings emptied out onto the sidewalk and they're all hovering around, you know?
L:  Right, right.  Oh my goodness.
R:  And, uh, and like, when you go hit the clubs, or you fill[?] with the drink and you're really smoking up, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know.  And then out west there, it's like, twenty, thirty bucks to get in these clubs.
L:  Right.
R:  You -- you pay the [inaudible], you walk in the door, you get one drink, you're like, "I need a ciggie" --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and you gotta leave!
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?  And then they won't let you back in after you leave, the line's out to ask to get in the place!
L:  Oh my goodness, that's crazy.
R:  So you just throw 'em thirty bucks and then --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- go in and have one drink, you're, "Gee, I gotta light up", so you leave and you go to the next place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they hit you for thirty bucks, and you go and you might have one or two, and then you gotta light up again, you gotta leave.  'Cause when I was out there the last time, it was like, the next morning I woke up, I said, " [inaudible], I dropped two hundred dollars in cover charges --"
L:  Whoa!
R:  "-- 'cause I could never sit in one place for longer than, uh, you know, half an hour".
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's --
R:  Or an hour, or whatever.  You know, after an hour it's like, "Damn, I need a ciggie, I gotta go".  So --
L:  Well, and to me -- now, to me, I think the -- the clubs -- [inaudible] the clubs is wasting, it's a definitely a little overboard, because, I mean, that's just a part of being sociable.
R:  That's right.
L:  And -- and you -- when you go in the club, you know you're gonna wanna drink and smoke a cigarette.  And I think -- I -- I don't think it should be banned in the clubs.
R:  Right.  Like, some of the cool or upscale ones out there, out west, they'll have separate rooms.
L:  W- -- uh-huh, okay.
R:  I was in some real nice joints.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they had a separate room where you can go and smoke.
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  [several inaudible words] cool as hell.
L:  Yeah, 'cause like you say --
R:  So --
L:  -- 'cause you just -- you just -- that's dropping too much money, 'cause like -- 'cause if you leave one place and then you decide, "Well, I really didn't wanna stay in there anyway" then you go somewhere else 'cause you've come out already, you don't wanna go right back home.
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I kinda think it's ridiculous, you know?  I -- and I was like, you know, that I think happened the very first time I was there, the first night out.
L:  Whoa!
R:  And, uh -- yeah, and then I got hit with it the next day.
L:  Yeah!  [LAUGH]
R:  I woke up and said, "Hey, that ain't happening again!"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  And you know, and they probably like it that --
R:  They just want me to go [inaudible] in the bathroom, that ain't happening again!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they probably like it that way, 'cause they probably make extra money that way.
R:  Oh yeah, of course.
L:  Definitely.  Or the -- or the, um, the, uh, the bounce- -- or the person at the door says, "Okay, I know you just left out of here but you give me ten you can back in, instead of paying another twenty" where -- and so his pockets --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is better at the end of the night.
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH]  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, Cassandra, where are you calling from?
L:  Talahape[?], Florida.
R:  Oh -- oh, Florida, oh right, I know where you're at.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, where are you?
R:  I'm in Cleveland, Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  How's the weather there?
R:  Oh, it's just starting to jump, man.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It is prime time up here.
L:  Whoa!
R:  Yeah, 'cause we have sh- --
L:  Yeah, we are already like, ninety five degrees.
R:  Oh yeah, I know, I know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've lived in Florida too.  So, it's so short up here, it's like, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, you've got three good months of summer, and all these people try to pack nine million events --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in three months!  So it's just like a total party from this weekend 'til September.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  But it's already booked, every weekend.  From people.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  I got plans clear up through August every weekend.
L:  Whoa!
R:  [several inaudible words].  Yeah, so it's about to get started, starting --
L:  Yeah, but it sounds like it's a fun place.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, it's fantastic, it's a cool city.
L:  Yeah, it sounds like it.  Sounds like it.
R:  Rock and roll capital of the world, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I tell you, here, with Talahape being the capital of Florida, it really sucks, there's -- there's really nothing to do, and, um --
R:  I've been through there.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, people will come just to see the +capital -- capital, or take pictures where the government live, but that's about it, there's nothing here.  People -- every -- you go so- to do something[?] I could leave here, go somewhere at least two hours either way, but there's nothing here to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not [inaudible].
R:  I like the accent.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I said, "I like the accent".
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  That [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But it's r- -- it's really -- for the most part it's --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Huh?
R:  I said, "I dig that".
L:  [LAUGH]  For the most part it's -- it's really boring here.
R:  I guess it's what you make of it, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, it is.  And -- and that's what you have to do, that's what you have to do, 'cause usually on the weekend we'll pack up and we'll go to Panama City or -- or somewhere.
R:  Yeah, Panama City's a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've been through it a few times.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we used to have a lot of, uh, a couple of properties down there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  One on each coast, actually.  One in West Hollywood -- or not West Hollywood -- Hollywood, Florida.
L:  Yeah, okay, I know.
R:  And -- and on the, uh, Atlanta coast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, just [MN] outside of Pompano[?] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- by Fort Lauderdale, there.
L:  Right.
R:  And we had one on the other coast in -- near Fort Myers.
L:  Oh, all right then.
R:  Yeah.  So I used to get down there quite often.  Well, they sold 'em both just recently --
L:  Oh.
R:  My family did.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know.  I'm kinda half out there, but that's all right!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I'll offer you some, uh --
L:  There you go, there you go!
R:  Yeah, I'm a big fan of the Keys too, so, you know, I'm -- I'll make another trip down there.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, you'll find something to do.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Definitely.  Definitely.
R:  And you can smoke as much as you like down there too.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I said, "Plus you can smoke as much as you like".
L:  Yes you can.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes you can.  As -- as much as you like, anywhere you like.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]  Very nice.
L:  Yes you can.  Sometimes I go to, uh, go to play bingo, and I tell you, even if you sit in the non smoking section, when you come out, I mean it -- it smells like somebody's just dumped you in a smoking barrel or something.  I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- your clothes are just like, saturated.
R:  Oh, that's a little rough.
L:  Yeah.  It's rough but, you know, it's okay, I get over it.  Especially --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I win!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, I've seen that before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, the bingo rooms.  I've seen that before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] heavy smoking.  It's like an AA meeting or something.
L:  E- exactly.  And then --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's so funny -- so do you have the little ladies -- and it is even been ladies in there with oxygen tanks.  I'm like, come on, now give me a break here -- and still smoking.
R:  Yeah, it is [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- unbelievable.  But they're hooked on that game, man, they love it.
L:  They're hooked on it.  You talk too loud if you want to, they'll be like, "Shh".  I'm like, "Okay, lady!"  [LAUGH]
R:  No kidding!  What a scene!
L:  Yes, yes.  But they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're the older ladies, they're serious about that bingo, though.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Serious about it, yeah, you know.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  But I think here they wouldn't stop people from smoking in the buildings or whatever, I think it'd be -- it's probably gonna be ugly.  You have a lotta people that'd be in jail.  "Why are you in jail?"  "Because I lit up a cigarette at [inaudible]".  I'm like, "Oh man!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm surprised it went over in New York, you know, the way those people are.
L:  E- exactly, yeah.
R:  I thought that they'd be like, "Fuck you!"
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm really surprised.
L:  For sure.  For sure.  I'm so like you.
R:  I don't know, they shut the strip bars out -- down out there too.  I am surprised they go away with that one.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Of all places.
L:  Yeah, for sure.  I'm [several inaudible words].
R:  That's that Guliane though, man, he -- he had it down.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, he had to hit the whole city down.
L:  Yeah, he did.  Yes, he did.
R:  [inaudible] he's no longer there anymore, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] still following -- [MN] just like in the way that he wanted it to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh --
L:  That's so true.
R:  Yeah, you know, I -- I don't particularly in -- like you were saying about the stench, I don't particularly enjoy that.  Like, my clothes going one time, they need washed, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  That's just from -- from being out in 'em in a smokey joint or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  You -- the next morning you wake up like, " [SIGH] Man, my clothes smell like [inaudible]".
L:  Oh no!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Hey, I'll put these things straight in the wash, you know, there's no --
L:  The -- [MN] wash them by themselves.
R:  -- [inaudible] anything twice, ever.
L:  Right.  You can't, you really can't.
R:  [several inaudible words].  [SIGH]
L:  That you sure can't, 'cause I'm saying, I mean, 'cause it's in there.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  It's in there.
