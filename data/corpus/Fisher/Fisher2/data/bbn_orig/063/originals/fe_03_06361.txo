R:  [NOISE] Brillandy[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Marianne.
R:  Okay, hi. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, are you a smoker?
R:  No, I'm not.  Are you?
L:  N- neither am I.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so how do you --
R:  Did you hear what the topic was about?
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] banning it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, right, right.  How do you feel about it?
R:  Well, um, I would l- -- I would love it to be banned in all public places, even close to the door.  I think it should be the total different area for smokers.
L:  So do I.  I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sister is very allergic to it, and she needs to be two rooms away, and she clogs up already and I do too, after a certain amount of time and it just seems always to come towards me when I'm in a restaurant or somewhere.
R:  Yeah, I e- -- yeah, even like the other day, I -- I went to, um, IHOP and I saw that -- we were coming through the entrance and I have a -- a newborn, and we're trying to go through and people are right by the door smoking, and even though the -- when the door opens, the smoke comes in, so I think they need to have a restricted area, and I know they banned it inside, I think outside the public area should be -- shouldn't be anywhere near the entrance. [COUGH] 
L:  Right, I agree with that.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And we have a -- see -- well, not right in the area, but, uh, where my nieces live, they have several restaurants that are non smoking, and we tend to go to them more than the others, just for that reason.
R:  Okay.  Um, um, is it -- is it true that most, um, places do banned it inside, or have they banned it f- for inside?
L:  Ah, it's -- they're non smoking altogether, some of 'em.
R:  Yeah, outside.  Mm.
L:  So I don't know and, you know, maybe -- and I don't see why people can't have a meal without smoking e- every minute. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's so true.
L:  Ah.
R:  And I think it -- it -- you know, as you were saying, even making it law now, I feel that, you know, they should really, um, pass a law that, you know, smoking sh- -- yeah, smoking should be banned in -- in public places and in the entrance of public places, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Uh, I f- -- I forgot what I was going to say. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I was trying to figure out what else they had told us to talk about.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Hey, for the life of me now, I can't think of what it was.  And I -- and -- and you would think, you know, when -- when the young kids -- I mean, there's so many young kids that start smoking when -- when they know that it's dangerous to their health.  I can't figure out -- and it's so expensive.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  O- one of the things they did say was, yeah, magazines, um, even the big bulletin board, they -- they do make it look cool, and even in the movies, um, somebody was saying that most movies you watch, there's always somebody on there that, um --
L:  Is smoking.
R:  Yeah, that's smoking.  So it makes them look like it's cool.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  And I know, my Dad used to smoke cigars when -- when he was alive, until he had an attack of appendicitis and then he dropped it just like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I know -- and I know they have things to do now that you can, you know, help you get over the urge or whatever, I don't know how well they work but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's the problem.  Most people say most of it doesn't w- -- don't work, and these companies need to -- need to be, um, need -- they need to be, you know, held accountable for what they do, because, um, they -- it is addictive and most people who are trying to quit can't quit.
L:  Right.
R:  If they can't say it's not their willpower, it's something that's making them addicted, like a drug.  It's like a drug.  Basically, it is a drug, it's -- it's a legal drug.
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and movies too, and like you say, every -- every movie, they have to be smoking in, and you would think they could start there, making movies where the people aren't smoking, it doesn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- add anything to the movie.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I don't think, anyways.
R:  I don't think they need to -- you need to be smoking even -- and they might not be doing, um, [SIGH] smoking, um, cigarettes, cig- -- smoking cigars, and they think that's cool and that makes you, you know, a big man, you know?
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  I don't know.  I don't know.
L:  It's the in -- in thing to do, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then I never even ever had the urge.
R:  Uh, yeah, I can't -- I can't stand it.  I can't stand it because I know what it's going to do to my health. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I -- and I really -- I really like the -- what the Truth company is doing right now, and the advertising, the young people are getting the message across, and I just think that in -- in the schools, they need to b- -- have more campaigns towards that, and the government needs to get involved, so, you know, there needs to --
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's right, and then you see so many parents with little babies too that are s- -- pushing the stroller --
R:  Oh, I hate that.
L:  -- smoking or whatever, and that --
R:  That should be illegal too.
L:  That's right.  That really irritates me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, smoking in front of a minor.  That just -- I mean, especially when you're in the car and your kid's in the car too and when your k- -- your k- -- your kid's hacking up a lung, what are you to do?  You can't -- you have to blame yourself.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  That's awful.  That's such a horrible --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Hm.
L:  I agree.
R:  That's horrible.
L:  There is [COUGH] -- and, like I say, the cost.  I mean, how can these young kids even -- how can you even afford it?
R:  You know what I've seen? [LIPSMACK] You know, most of the kids don't buy the cigarettes per se, and I know in the Ninety Nine Cent stores they sell cigarettes, they sell these little, um, I don't know what they're called, it's a brown -- it's brown, it has this kinda --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- sweet smell to it.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  And they have that little, um, pipe you put on the top of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they buy that for, like, a quarter.
L:  Oh.
R:  So they can go one at a time, you know, buy one stick at a time.  I've seen that done and I'm, like, "Wow".
L:  Oh, I've never -- I've never seen that or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess --
R:  So --
L:  -- I guess in this area, I live in a small town here, I don't see too much. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I live in Miami, so it's the city, so I've seen that and I'm, like, "Whoa".  I think this is why they can get it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And even -- if they don't get it, they have somebody else that gets it for them.
L:  Oh, yeah, right.
R:  And to -- yeah, just like alcohol.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's just -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have --
L:  I --
R:  -- they do have ways around it.
L:  Yeah, that's for sure.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or someone else goes and buys it for 'em and that's stupid too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I --
R:  So, I don't know.  Used to be --
L:  -- I don't think they'll ever get it banned completely but it sure would be nice, as far as I'm concerned.
R:  Yeah, they made it -- if they made cigarettes illegal, they'd get rid of it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They'd be selling cigarettes on the street like drugs. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it would -- it would help anyway [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I know it now, 'cause they'd still get it.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Imagine being busted for a cigarette. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Here's one. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Wow.  That would be really great.
L:  Like I say, no, my car doesn't even have a cigarette lighter it.  I bought it used, and sometimes I wish it did have one, because, you -- you know, you can't charge up a cellphone, [LAUGH] nothing, because I have a [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's the only re- -- thing I have.  Mine doesn't even work, but that's the reason I want a -- a lighter is just to, um, plug into cha- -- uh, charge something --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- just charge my phone, or charge the, you know, the vacuum cleaner, whatever.  But --
L:  Yeah, and I --
R:  -- that's it.
L:  -- I'm lucky I don't have to ride with smokers too often, because that would really irritate me.
R:  That'd be horrible.  And not only that, smokers on the street, I've driven down the street where people are smoking, and my window is down, the breeze comes into my car.  Not only that, they flick the end of it --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and the ash comes my way also. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think smoking and driving should be -- if you're going to smoke, roll your window up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and keep the window up. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.
R:  Don't -- you shouldn't be able to put it down, either.
L:  I know, we -- I was shopping the other day, and I think it was by the grocery store, there was two di- -- two different guys that were smoking and before they'd go in, they'd just throw their cigarette, didn't stomp it out or nothing, just threw it --
R:  Yeah, flick it.
L:  -- in the street, yeah, yeah.
R:  I think --
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  -- that's wrong.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's real wrong.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, right.  I do too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  I agree.  I totally agree.  But it's -- it's going to be hard to have somebody who's going to be, um, what you'd call the, um, [LIPSMACK] the monitor of this -- of this thing.
L:  Right.
R:  You know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- this -- that's what's going to be so hard, have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somebody monitor it.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  So ... [LIPSMACK] we'll see.
L:  Yeah, but you would think that these tobacco companies, like you say, would -- would have some consideration, but I suppose money's the name --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- of the game. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're -- they're making the m- -- they're making the money and --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- for them to ban something that's making so much money, they -- they wouldn't want to do it.
L:  Yeah, that's just --
R:  That's why they gotta find a way to make it -- make it seem as if, "Oh, there's nothing wrong with it.  If they wanna kick the habit, they can kick the habit".
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right, and I know better than that though, 'cause I had an aunt and uncle that tried to do it, and they never -- they -- I mean, they'd quit for a while and they'd go right back to it again.
R:  Yeah.  Oh --
L:  And they were h- heavy smokers.
R:  And it's amazing that there's so many people there in the hospital dying of cancer and the can- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and people don't know where the cancer is coming from and, you know, you don't wanna think that, oh, one day you're going to get the cancer because of -- of something somebody else did, which is unfair.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it always seems to be the person who's the cause of a situation is not the one that gets hurt --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, like, "Oh, yeah, I've been smoking for sixty years, twenty years, thirty years" and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you -- you know, you're surviving, yet I -- I smelled yours for, like, two or three minutes and now I'm sick.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just like the drunk driver.  The drunk driver never dies, the other person does, you know?
L:  Yeah, right, right.  It's always --
R:  That's just -- it's horrible.
L:  -- the innocent somebody that has to suffer for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I don't like.
R:  But I -- I would love to see how the government's going to -- [MN] going to, you know, do something about it, how -- how -- how are they going to s- -- even start to go about it?
L:  Well, yeah, right, that's for sure.
R:  You know, advertising, the advertising isn't -- isn't really important if they don't have -- they -- I had to have a -- I haven't seen a lot of it on TV.  There's certain adult magazines, I guess, the older magazines, um, which I guess they try to attract the older people, have those ads in these, but with the younger one, like teen magazines, I -- I know they don't have it in those.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I don't get to see too many of them, but -- in fact, I don't k- know that I see too much, you know, definite cigarette advertising at all in what the --
R:  I don't see it at all, mhm.
L:  Yeah.  It's just [MN] --
R:  Yeah, so I guess they got rid of that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and most of the people I think aren't too -- but, you know, it's still there.  Even though it's not advertised it's been around --
L:  But --
R:  -- for so long.
L:  Yeah, a- and by word of mouth, and, like, all these kids, like we're saying, they all want to feel cool by starting to smoke and [SIGH] whatever. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  Long ten minutes, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, it -- I guess, I'm not sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Does it tell us when it's time to stop?
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
R:  It doesn't?
L:  It's supposed to, I thought they'd say when it was ten minutes.
R:  Oh.
L:  I can't remem- --
R:  This is my first call.
L:  Yeah, thi- --
