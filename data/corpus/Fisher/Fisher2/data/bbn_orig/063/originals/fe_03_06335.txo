R:  Hi, this is Martha.
L:  Hi, I'm Sharon.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  [LAUGH] So, sh- --
L:  So, have you done one of these calls before?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Have you done one of these calls before?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, my first too.
R:  [LAUGH] Great.
L:  Okay.  So, talking about smoking.
R:  Yes.  Do you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you agree with that or not?
L:  I, uh, think that all the campaigns that they can do, uh, to stop smoking are probably helpful.
R:  I think so too, but I also think they take away from the liberties of people though.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  Because of the -- of the banning of smoking or -- I mean, I don't know what state you're in.
L:  Actually, I'm in Canada.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  Yeah, and we do --
R:  -- well, 'cause in California we're -- you're not allowed to smoke inside the restaurants and everything.
L:  Yeah, same with where I am.
R:  Oh.  I mean, I -- I like it, because you get the clean air, but at the same time, I feel sometimes they're violating the rights of those who smoke.
L:  Yeah, I would tend to agree with you on that.  Um, I guess it depends -- I used to smoke --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I quit, oh, gosh, twenty years ago.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, uh, from that standpoint I, you know, I can see where you're coming [MN] from, where you think you're sort of infringing on other people's rights and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and that sort of thing, but, uh --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- I also feel that it's, uh, it's such a big issue, you know, when you've had cancer in the family that's been caused by smoking --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that, uh, y- you tend to feel strongly about it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about having the bans in -- in public places.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I -- I think it's kind of like a dual edged sword --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- yeah.
R:  At -- at -- and one point, because I do not like people who -- to -- to be smoking around me.
L:  So, you're a non smoker?
R:  I'm a non smoker. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and I've always been, and my whole thing, when I used to go to the dancing, I mean, the -- the smoke you get, and the smell you get in your -- [MN] your clothes and your hair and, you know, and that's a violation o- of -- of -- of me, I feel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But at the same time, I do understand on the other side.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I, uh, I don't know, I've seen some of the -- the commercials that they put out, I don't know if you get the same sort of commercials that we get for the anti smoking things, but, um, there is one that's currently on up here in Canada and it's, uh, a woman who never smoked a day in her life --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and she died of lung cancer, because she was a waitress --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, you know, smoking was allowed.  So, they've got her -- actually, she's passed away now, but they've got her, um, giving her story on TV and I think it's -- it's pretty darn effective.
R:  You think so?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think people who -- some people just -- it's in their genes or -- I mean, I know my grandfather was a smoker and he was the healthiest man ever. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, he, you know, he died of old age, but nothing of cancer or anything like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] But the ads --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- never worked for him. [LAUGH]
L:  He was darn lucky. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] He was one of the few, I guess.
L:  I think so.  See, my Dad was a smoker and he went through, uh, throat cancer.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and, I mean, he's lucky he made it through, but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, there -- there's just too much that can go wrong with it, but, uh, you know, I think the more restricted that you make something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the more attractive it is, as well.
R:  Yes.  I think so.  I think, like, for now, for in- instance, in California, they're trying to pass it that you have to be twenty one years old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to -- in order to buy cigarettes.
L:  Ah.
R:  And I -- and I do think it's more tempting and it's more appealing, because you always want to do what's not right.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  So, it's -- it's giving the kids more incentives, I think.
L:  Mhm, well --
R:  I think -- oh --
L:  -- they'll find a way to get it, no matter what. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I think people who -- I -- I mean, I don't know, I feel bad for the smokers because they -- they're paying all these taxes now and they're, you know, having to ship out more money for -- for, uh, their habit and I don't know if there's enough -- [NOISE] enough evidence or proof that only smoking, you know, is the main cause of -- of the cancer or -- you know?
L:  Mm.  See, I would disagree with you on that.  I think that's been proven --
R:  You think so?
L:  -- over and over and over again.
R:  But is it because of that, or is it because people already have other diseases or genetics before that --
L:  You mean --
R:  -- and that just enhances it?
L:  -- by being predisposed to it?
R:  Yeah, there you go.  That's the word.
L:  Yeah.  I am -- I'm really not sure --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on that one, yeah, it could be, but, uh, I don't know, I don't think there's any, you know, medically necessary reason to smoke either.
R:  That's true.  But it's people --
L:  You know, i- it's no benefit to you.  All it does is take your money. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  [LAUGH] You must be saving a lot of money now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know what?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When I quit smoking, I used to take that money, and this is, like, twenty years ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- took the money that I u- used to spend on cigarettes and put it in enve- -- an envelope and just tucked it away, and a year later, I got to recarpet the whole house, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  I mean, when you think of it that way, it's a huge waste of money.
R:  Uh-huh. [MN]
L:  Yeah, but, anyway --
R:  [LAUGH] I'm trying to think of [LAUGH] --
L:  Hm?
R:  I'm trying to think of other things.  I don't -- but, I mean, some of the ads do help.  I think, um, it depends who they gear them to.
L:  Yeah, do you --
R:  It --
L:  -- have a lot that are geared towards the teens?
R:  Yeah, we have a lot that, you know, they used to sell the -- the cigarettes in the little machines.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that -- those kind of ads, that they're still doing them, or trying the ads of the truth, or selling cigarettes in ice cream machines.
L:  Oh --
R:  The ice cream trucks.
L:  -- oh, I think I've seen that, yeah.
R:  Yeah, you seen those?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I think those are a little bit effective, but I think -- I'm not sure if children are actually watching those specific- specifically.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I've got a -- a teenage son --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- and so far, knock on wood, he doesn't smoke.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and, you know, he sees these commercials and he -- he kind of looks at me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and goes, "That's really gross" [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, you know, it's making an impact of him, I'm -- I'm hoping.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, hopefully he won't ever start up.  And he knows that, um, both me and his Dad used to smoke and we've both quit, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- we also bribe him and say, "If you don't smoke by the time you're seventeen or eighteen, you'll get, you know, this amount of money". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm not sure i- if kids actually get to see these commercials that are geared towards them, or is it geared towards the parents to influence the children?
L:  Uh, probably both.
R:  Probably both? [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:   H- how do you s- --
L:  I know they -- they talk about it quite a bit in school, even at, uh, the elementary level up here.
R:  Oh, okay, see, I don't have children, I'm not sure. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They do, they've got, you know, really disgusting looking posters of what your face looks like [LAUGH] after you've smoked for twenty years --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, it's really a horrible thing, so, uh, yeah.
R:  How --
L:  They do see it.
R:  -- how about the one that they -- they show of -- of -- I don't if you've seen it over there, that the baby, you know, would you rather have baby A or baby B?
L:  Oh, I haven't seen that.
R:  That -- that pregnant women who smoke have smaller children and the guy that says, "Well, women want to have smaller children, so it doesn't matter".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I don't know how that -- I mean, do -- do moms go back, [MN] you know, after the pregnancy and smoke or do they smoke through -- throughout the pregnancy?
L:  Yeah, I've known women that have done both, but yeah, that's why I quit, actually, is 'cause we wanted to start our family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, y- yeah, you know, it's -- it's, uh --
R:  But was it --
L:  -- it's a tough one. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  I say it's a tough one.  I mean, if you are a smoker and you wanna have children and you know that it's not going to be good for them, that -- that would be, um, [LIPSMACK] I would think it would be very difficult to stop.
R:  But do you think --
L:  And --
R:  -- it was the -- the -- the commercials that influenced you, or was it just you knowing that it's not a good thing?
L:  Well, I think [SIGH] -- I think the commercials and every sort of campaign that's out there, it kinda stays in the back of your mind, and I think everybody knows that it's not good for you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it can cause problems.  I mean, we even have a -- the, uh, writing on the side of the cigarette packages that, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] The warning.
L:  -- "Smoking can cause death".  Well, yeah [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- who wants that?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, I -- I -- I think people know enough about it now that they know it -- it -- it is no benefit to you, so I don't know if it's -- I guess it probably is the campaigns on all the ads that they've done that has created the awareness.
R:  Hm.
L:  That and talking to a doctor.
R:  So, do you think now it -- it's -- people are more aware because of all the campaigning versus, you know, twenty, thirty years ago, where smoking was everywhere?
L:  Oh, I think so.
R:  Hm.
L:  I think so, because, I mean, when you -- I think back to, you know, when I was a kid, and I think all my aunts and uncles and all the adults in my life probably smoked. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause it was a -- a -- a -- an accepted thing, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But do you think, like, all these commercials then create, like, a negative, um, a- aspect to -- to smokers?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm sorry, it makes them what?
R:  Like a negative aspect, you know, people are perceived as this -- as, you know, "Oh, you're a smoker, I don't want to talk to you or -- or hang out with you"?
L:  Well, yeah, I think --
R:  Like a subculture. [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, I think it is getting a little bit more socially unacceptable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like you said, you've got the -- the bans on smoking in public places.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you find when you're -- when you're out with friends and that, or the people that you hang around with, or if you go to a party or something, do you find that there's more people smoking now, or less?
R:  That's where all -- you see all the smokers outside now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, all huddled together in a group, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they go outside and they smoke and then they come back in, so it kind of creates a little subculture --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of them, but I don't -- I don't see any of them really stopping.
L:  No?
R:  You know, they're -- they -- they're in -- I don't know, they like it, so --
L:  So, that you think the people that are -- are the smokers aren't influenced at all?
R:  Um, I don't think they're all gonna -- I mean, eventually, maybe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But as of now, I don't think that they're going -- that the ads really persuade them, because they [MN] -- their argument is -- is that everything is bad for you and they're going to find something that's always going to cause something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A sort of illness or something, or something to that extent.
L:  That's true.  Too much of anything is probably bad for you, maybe except for water. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, even though they -- you know, they see the ads and -- and they've seen everything that the -- the statistics and everything, that's -- that --
