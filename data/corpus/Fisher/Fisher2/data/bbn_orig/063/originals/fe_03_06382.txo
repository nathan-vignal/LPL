R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name is Paula, I'm in Florida.  Who's this?
L:  My name is Elaine, I'm in LA.
R:  Hi, Elaine.
L:  Hi.
R:  Yeah, it's a bit earlier out there, isn't it?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  So, what do you think about tonight's +topic about, uh, smoking?
L:  Uh ... to ban it in public places, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  ... I think that's a good idea.
R:  Me too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Have you ever smoked?
L:  Oh, once or twice.  Mm.
R:  Once or twice. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you didn't have the bad habit for years like I did?
L:  No, I n- -- my parents smoked but I never really wanted to.  I didn't like -- like the smell or anything.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  Or the -- uh-huh.
R:  Very good.  So --
L:  Are you in Miami?  What part of Florida are you --
R:  Uh, no, I'm actually about midway up on the East Coast, about an hour north of West Palm Beach.
L:  Oh, Jacksonville?  Uh --
R:  Uh, it's, um, Port Saint Lucie.
L:  Oh, I've never heard of that one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never been in Florida.  Hot there today?  It's been hot here.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well it -- anyway, about --
R:  I- --
L:  We should get back on the subject of the smoking, um ... I think, uh, there should be more banning of smoking in public places.  Like, I think they have it --
R:  Now, it is here in Florida, but we recently traveled to Tennessee and it was not there.
L:  No.
R:  Uh, what about in LA or in California in general, is it banned there?
L:  Well, you can smoke outdoors, although Santa Monica is trying to stop it.  But I mean, you can s- -- you can't smoke in restaurants or bars or -- I don't think m- -- uh, yeah, you can't smoke in, um -- there are places, public places, you know, in, ah, down in stores or anything, you have to smoke outside.
R:  So are they adhering to that pretty well everywhere you go?
L:  Yeah, I believe they are, uh-huh.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  Actually, there's a couple of restaurants that I've been in recently here in Florida and they're -- they have smoking and nonsmoking sections and I kind of wondered how they're --
L:  Oh, they used to have that here but I -- I think you can just smoke outside, like, if there's a patio, er, outside you can smoke there.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I haven't really asked but I'm curious how they're getting away with that if they've banned smoking in all the public places, especially in a restaurant when you're eating.
L:  Yeah, but I think --
R:  You know, that's -- that's a rough place.
L:  I don't think -- here they don't ha- -- you can't do that inside, you've gotta go outside to -- to smoke.
R:  Wow.
L:  Uh --
R:  I know as a -- as a previous smoker for many years and also I -- as a bartender previously, that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of people smoke, or chain smoke, when they're drinking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I bet [LAUGH] I bet it's the hardest at the bars.  And I'm -- I was just curious if people actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- adhere to that.
L:  Well, they have to.  They get fined or something like that if they don't.
R:  Mhm.  So, do you go -- do you go out to the pub- -- in pub- -- [inaudible] very often?
L:  To where?
R:  In public.  You know, in public interiors --
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  -- like restaurants or bars or airports or --
L:  Yeah, there's no smoking in them.  Uh, I don't -- I don't believe so.
R:  That's great.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Very good.  Um --
L:  Maybe in different counties it might be different, I -- I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I thought it was the whole state but -- I think if it's a --
R:  Mm --
L:  -- very small bar they have a right to ... some place -- certainly counties regulate it, but ...
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I wasn't really sure if the law was statewide.  I guess I haven't followed it that closely --
L:  I think it is statewide, yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  I just see it getting better and I'm thankful for that. [LAUGH] But I am irritated when I'm in a restaurant and I'm in the non- nonsmoking section and it's just a partition wall ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... you know, just barely over the height of a table and it just wafts over from the smoking section in my face.
L:  Right, I guess it does.
R:  I really don't appreciate that too much.  I think if they are going to have a smoking section or break the law they need to make sure the smoke doesn't waft over into someone else's face. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think it would if it's -- one section's smoking and one non if it's close for a -- together, I think it would go over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, what about the ads and the campaigns to help people quit smoking.  What do you think about that?
L:  Mm, I think that's -- it's helpful.  They have Nicorette gum and the patch.  I don't know if that works but -- I guess if somebody wants it -- wants it to work it will and if they don't it won't, so, uh ...
R:  Right.  I tend to agree with you a -- a great deal.  I think a lot of people -- it just depends on how strong their will is to really quit smoking, what their [inaudible] --
L:  Well, a lot of people don't wanna quit so they just, uh, they don't wanna quit smoking.
R:  Yeah.  I know when I was a bartender I tried and tried several times to quit but I just -- I couldn't do it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just wasn't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- wasn't able to do it.  But I was around smokers the whole night. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I used to dance in -- in San Francisco and different places and there was always smoking, you know.  You could always, um, know that it was there.
R:  I definitely think that makes it harder when you're a smoker and you're around smokers, or a drinker and around drinkers, or whatever --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- your vice may be. [LAUGH] And I do see smoking --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as a vice. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  What about you?
L:  Well, I never think that much about -- I don't care about it and, uh, I have friends who care about it, especially when they raise the prices of -- of them.  Now they're four or five dollars and pretty soon they'll be more.  In New York it's seven dollars, I think, for one pack, someone --
R:  Oh, my gosh, you're kidding me.
L:  No, no.  And here it's maybe --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- four fifty or if they buy it, like, on the street it's two fifty or something, the illegal cigarette- --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I had no idea.  I don't even know how much cigarettes are around here.  I guess --
L:  No?
R:  I thought they were between two and three dollars a -- a ...
L:  Oh.
R:  ... a pack, but --
L:  Well, I don't know, maybe they're cheaper.  In Vegas, I think, they're cheaper but I [several inaudible words] Nevada but I don't know what they are there.
R:  Mm.
L:  Probably.
R:  And do you have any friends that smoke, Elaine?
L:  No, not, uh, not --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- good friends, no.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  No, they don't smoke.
R:  What do you think about secondhand smoke?
L:  Well, I don't think it's good for people, although they say it -- it's not as bad as they thought, but I -- I don't think it's -- it's good.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, I think we're pretty much in agreement.  We'd rather just stay away from it altogether. [LAUGH]
L:  And of course the smog in LA is as bad as smoking anyway.  There have smog here a lot in the summer and that's pretty bad.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I actually was in LA when I was fourteen.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, we had some relatives that lived out there.  I can't remember the name of the city right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It might come to me.  But it was so funny because there was a big mountain --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somewhere off in the distance and we couldn't even see it.  Not at all.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then in the afternoon, I guess the smog burned off, he said, and there was this huge mountain. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I couldn't believe it.
L:  Oh.
R:  It wasn't even all that far away.
L:  Really?  Uh-huh.
R:  So ... I don't know what mountain that is but I just know there w- -- it looked like there was nothing there in the morning and in the afternoon it was -- it was a big mountain. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that's pretty bad that we have to put up with that kind of pollution and then people voluntarily put it into their lungs.
L:  Yes.
R:  But I remember I -- I quit -- I started smoking when I was a teenager because we thought it was cool.  You know, it was that whole peer pressure, thinking you're cool thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Looking grown up.  What a shame.
L:  Well, I think years ago people didn't know it wasn't good.  And -- and, you know, they showed it a lot in movies, people smoked in movies and TV shows and things like that.  And some famous people th- -- people thought it was probably good.  And then the ads for it, you know, always showed people happy and all this stuff, smoking and ... yeah.
R:  That brings up another good point about how role models in movies and how advertising really influences people.
L:  Yes.  Right.
R:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  And i- --
L:  They don't show people who are sick from it, they show people who look happy and all this stuff and look well.  I mean, so, you know, it has this certain image, I guess.
R:  Have you seen some of those commercials, um, they say truth?
L:  Huh?  They s- --
R:  Have you seen some of those commercials, they talk about, um, truth?  I think it's just [LIPSMACK] --
L:  No.  Uh --
R:  Something about truth.  Yeah, and they -- they go -- it's -- it's a young group of -- of kids, I don't know, maybe college age.
L:  Mm.
R:  And they go into, like, famous businesses, you know, cigarette companies and whatnot --
L:  No.
R:  -- and they really hit them between the eyes with the truth of what smoking does to people.  They're like --
L:  Well, I never saw that.  Maybe they don't have that here but they have certain ads about cigarettes saying, um, "Gee, if I -- if I give smoking up I'll, um, lose ... I'll gain weight" and then -- then -- then a girl comes on and says, uh, "God, I've lost so much weight, I -- [LAUGH] you know, from" -- and then she's sick and then other parts of it saying, uh, [COUGH] "God, I can't live without a cigarette" and the other ... the doctor saying, "I can't operate any more" and [LAUGH] I don't know --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- things like that.
R:  -- so they're showing the -- the pros and cons.
L:  No, not the pro- -- I mean, the bad part.  Just -- it's just showing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- this guy first being happy, saying, "I can't live without a cigarette" and then the doctor saying, "Well, I'm sorry, this is -- I can't operate".  Well [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  And then somebody else saying, um ... you know, different -- different things for one person.
R:  Yeah, the people's perception of the good things --
L:  Well, one person is, um --
R:  -- about it or -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] then it shows after a while this other person is real sick and -- from smoking and --
R:  Yeah, shows the reality and the ugliness of it.
L:  And they can't, you know, fix it now or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, that's good; it sounds like the truth is getting out.  It's funny though, isn't it, when -- you know how smoking's changed so much?
L:  Well, people have sued --
R:  How it used to be so supported.
L:  -- tobacco companies and -- and won millions of dollars, I think, in the States too.  But some people have sued even though they knew smoking was bad.  I don't know whether they won.  [inaudible] ... uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's what it said, I read.  Millions of dollars --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they've won, [inaudible].
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess it's taken --
L:  But if they knew then -- then they -- I don't know if they have a recourse.  I mean, if they knew fr- from, you know, knowing it wasn't good or something, like, they should -- they don't have any -- they shouldn't have to sue, or -- or it doesn't seem logical that they'd win or --
