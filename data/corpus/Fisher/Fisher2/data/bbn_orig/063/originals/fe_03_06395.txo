L:  Hello, my name's April.
R:  Hi, my name is Angela.
L:  Are w- -- okay, we're still on, right?
R:  Right.
L:  You're there?  Okay. [LAUGH] Sometime- --
R:  Actually, I don't -- I don't -- I don't know of anyone that would keep calm during a terrorist attack. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I don't think so. [LAUGH] I --
R:  That's not very realistic at all. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I think I'd be -- I'd -- I'd have to probably tell myself to be a little bit calm because we do have a two year old but, you know, o- on -- on top of everything no, no, not ... not completely calm.  I don't think that that's possible. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, you're right, and I have a four year old and a -- and the, uh, seven year old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I would have to try and, like you say, maintain some sanity just for their sake but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if things happen when -- when they're not around, if I'm at work and they're at school --
L:  Yeah, that would put in panic.
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I- if they were --
L:  A lot of panic.
R:  If they were nice enough to do it on a weekend then it would be easier but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the chances of that are slim.  But [inaudible] the way of life now, I guess.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Anymore.  They keep raising the level and lowering it and ... [SIGH] it's, um, put everybody into a bit of panic, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, just knowing that it could occur, you know.
R:  Any minute.  Especially when they name cities and possible specific areas.
L:  Right.  Are you -- well, see, we're over in -- we're in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.  I -- I'm down in Atlanta.
L:  Yeah.  See, if whoever -- you know, whenever all that's -- we actually had where the, um, one plane had come down.  That's not too far from us, you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  So it was pretty scary to see that and --
R:  My goodness.
L:  -- at -- at the time, my husband at -- was at work, and at that point m- my son was just a couple of months old so it was -- you know, that put me into panic because they were talking about closing the, um, bridges and stuff down --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- where we're at.  And then, you know, my husband didn't have access to get home if the bridges were closed down because he'd have to go over one, you know.
R:  So they wind -- they didn't do that, they didn't wind up closing any of the bridges?
L:  Uh, no, they under- -- they didn't -- I don't think they did anyhow. [MN] Um, not that we were aware of.  But they -- you know, when he was coming home they were discussing it and I'm thinking, you know, "How's he even going to get home" and then -- you know.
R:  Oh.  That would have caused more panic, I believe.
L:  Yeah.  And that's -- that's what I did, I was panicking about that.  Because you never know, you know, what's going to happen or where because ... you know, uh, from what they said, the Government had all this information about the, uh, Twin Towers and New York City anyhow and nothing was ever said.
R:  You know, I heard that.  That's awful --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they did and didn't do anything about it.
L:  And, uh -- yeah, and I mean I understand where you can't take every threat seriously but --
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  -- you know, you can at least, you know, give the people a -- a thought as to what may occur and ...
R:  I guess that's why we're hearing so much about what they know now.
L:  Yes.  Tha- that's what I'm saying, 'cause it's, like, you know, I mean I know that if there's a shot at it, I wouldn't be there that day.  You know what I mean?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Because I know even with me, my -- my mom lives in California and she's been wanting me to come out and visit her.  And I said, "I won't -- I won't get on the planes right now".  I said, "I just won't do it".
R:  Ah, no, I don't care how cheap they are, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think -- well, most people feel like that they've attacked us through the, uh, airline system, that they won't do it again.  But I think that may be a -- a quicker, easier way for them to get access --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- with people thinking, "Okay, well, they did it this way, they won't do it that way again" so --
L:  Right.  And it is, it gets -- it gets -- you know, I mean, even with them switching the security and stuff now, you see things on TV with -- where they had, um ... the Government had taken over the security at the airports --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then those --
R:  Right.
L:  And then they find out that, like, however many ten or twenty percent of them have criminal backgrounds.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  Well, what -- what good is that, you know?
R:  That is the -- pointless, right.
L:  What's the difference in taking the people out that were doing the job in the first place to put people in that have criminal backgrounds to begin with, you know?
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  They just don't -- they don't screen well enough, is what I'm thinking.
R:  Wow, I hadn't heard about that.
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was --
R:  So they discovered that a lot of the people that they hired ...?
L:  I- it was a small percentage but still enough, you know what I mean?
R:  Wow, right.
L:  And they were -- [COUGH] they -- they just put that on the news, like, two days ago I saw it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So it kinda tossed me -- you know, I mean, that tosses you in the panic too. [MN]
R:  Mm.
L:  And that's why I said, you know, you can never be too sure on --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- on anything. [MN]
R:  I'm sure they would be very easily persuaded if they needed to be. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly, that's what I'm saying.  I mean, you already got a background, y- you know, what the heck.
R:  Oh.
L:  Why stop there, I guess, you know.
R:  My goodness.
L:  But oh, yeah, the panic ... the panic's definitely there.
R:  Y- you never know which way it's going to go, I tell you.
L:  Yeah.  And that's like right now I'm not too panicky but you ne- -- you know what I mean, you never know exactly.
R:  You just have to be hopeful, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just a different state of mind after that 'cause you just never know when.
L:  That's it, you've just gotta be more ... you know, more -- more -- see, uh, the one thing I do is I won't go, [MN] you know, like, if -- at -- at the time they were doing the heightened security at the -- the baseball games and the football games and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I just -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't go and purchase a ticket at that point, you know what I mean?  I wouldn't -- 'cause there were a couple of things that we -- you know, we as a family usually go ahead and do but s- -- whenever they have that heightened security and stuff if that's a large place then we just don't go, you know.
R:  Yeah, I mean, if they have to go through all of that they have some reason for doing in and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- better safe than sorry.
L:  Yeah, that's it.  Better safe than sorry.  'Cause I know ... you know, n- not being there for the day is just more, you know, reasonable to me than giving it a shot, you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm, yeah, just imagine the people who do show up, after going through all the security you have to imagine what goes through their mind.
L:  Right.
R:  Go in anyway.
L:  And there's other -- there's other things that we go to that, you know, you think that they'd have security and there -- there isn't, you know.  Like, we went ... [MN] me and my friend had gone to a concert at the, um -- one of our arenas here and it holds a lot of people, you know, and I expected a lot of security.
R:  Right.
L:  They let you walk right through, they -- they kinda had you open your purse or, you know, if you had a purse with you and just look through it, but nothing -- nothing other than that. [MN]
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, and I sat there --
R:  That's scary. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I said, "Ooh" you know.  And I took a shot at it, I said, "Okay, I'll go" but, you know, I really thought that --
R:  That would have been a easy target, I see what you mean.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I thought, you know, it would have been higher security than that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there wasn't really any, you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause I'm thinking, you know, checking the women's purses, w- -- you know, what are your chances, I mean, of a woman compared to a guy walking -- walking in with something, you know, if they're doing the terror thing?
R:  Did they have any, um, any of those, um, equipments that detect metal?
L:  The metal detectors?
R:  Right.
L:  No, nothing.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  That's why I said -- I said I was really surprised 'cause, you know, the -- the only thing that they really -- I really saw them check were the women's purses and they didn't -- they didn't scan you with metal detectors or nothing.
R:  Well, now, see, that's just regular --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- security measures, I guess, to check the purses so --
L:  Yeah, and that's what they -- that's what they usually do here, they'll check your purses but, you know, for one of the concerts there really wasn't -- there wasn't any -- any kind of extra security that I thought there would be, and ... not a thing.  I'm sitting there thinking, "Boy, that would have been an easy target", you know.
R:  Right.  It probably made it hard to concentrate or -- or enjoy yourself after getting in so easy.
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, it didn't bother me all that much because at that point I figured, you know, there probably wasn't much of a reason to go ahead and heighten the security, but still if you're looking at the ... [MN] you know, like, they were doing all the football games and stuff like that, they were doing heightened security.  Why wouldn't you do it at a concert that holds, you know, almost as many?
R:  Right, right.
L:  [MN]
R:  If you're looking in -- in terms of numbers.  But maybe they were looking at the popularity of -- of whatever the event was.
L:  Yeah, I guess.  You never know. [LAUGH]
R:  No, you never know what they're thinking. [LAUGH]
L:  But then you'd think with as many concerts as they have, though -- and too, you know, even in the -- in the summertime, that you'd have some sort of security.  'Cause if it holds thirty thousand, that's still thirty thousand.  You know what I mean?
R:  My God, yeah.
L:  But nope, nothing --
R:  It's like an easy target.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's why -- and then ...
R:  Was it inside of an arena?
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was in a -- it was in a clo- -- it's a closed arena.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's, like, um, where the Pittsburgh Penguins play, that's ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  ... that's where they ha- -- that's where they have the con- -- that's where they also hold the concerts at, so ...  You know, it holds a good bit and it is closed in [COUGH] but each -- you know, some things you just sit there and think, "Okay, where's the security?" and ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, even [MN] even with the airport, so I said I won't get on a plane yet.
R:  Oh, no, me either.
L:  I don't feel comfortable enough to do that.
R:  I don't care if it was free. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  If it was free I don't think I would ride one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I had already had a fear of 'em before nine eleven.  But just after that, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And yeah, so, you know --
R:  Just to see how vulnerable ...
L:  Those people get right back on those planes and they go traveling the next day.  I said, "Ooh".
R:  Ugh.
L:  I don't know if I could do that.
R:  Uh-uh.  I know that I couldn't.  It's been over a year now and I -- I --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- still am hesitant about it.
L:  Ye- yeah.  It's the same way I am.  I said I'd rather go and jump on a train and take a trip across the country before I get on one of them planes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Or drive, yeah.  Me too.
L:  And I know that they're uncomfortable, smaller, but I'll do it, you know. [MN] It's terrible.  But you s- -- you say you have, um -- does your school -- does the school that your kids go to, do they have, like, a ...?
R:  Oh yeah.  They have, um, they have, uh, an evacuation plane and, um --
L:  Oh, they do.
R:  Yeah.  Well they -- they came up with it, um ... actually it hasn't been that long ago.  It seems like they would have administered something right after nine eleven but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think it was only about the beginning of -- of the year.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  It had to be --
