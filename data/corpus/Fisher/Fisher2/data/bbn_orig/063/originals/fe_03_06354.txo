R:  Hi, I'm Kaya[?].
L:  Hi, I -- my name is Linda and I'm from Cloquet, Minnesota.
R:  I'm from California.
L:  Oh.  Um, well, how do you feel about smoking?
R:  Well, I do, I smoke.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mm, so, I mean, can't really say anything.  It is bad, I already know that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  I guess what they want us to discuss is if we f- feel like it sh- -- it should be banned in all public places.
R:  If they sh- -- if they should ban it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in all public places?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] shoot, I mean, I don't -- I don't think so, I mean, [NOISE] I mean, it's -- it's legal, [LAUGH] so, I mean, to smoke cigarettes so, I mean, I don't think it should be a problem as long it's separated from, you know, people who don't smoke. [SIGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Uh, but, uh, sometimes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- w- when I'm in a place that is not against smoking, I -- I do not smoke, so I guess you and I are opposite. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, uh, when somebody sits by me after I'm already comfortable and in my place --
R:  Yeah.  I would never smoke next to somebody that doesn't smoke --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I know -- I know how it feels, 'cause when I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- younger and I didn't like it either. [LAUGH] So --
L:  Yeah, and I -- I feel like it kills, so -- my Mom died of cancer and, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she played, uh, she was, uh, kind of homebound, and she played, uh, Skipper with -- with a friend that, uh, you know, smoked one cigarette after the other and -- and then my -- my -- and I'm thinking, you know, my Mom --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- got this cancer.
R:  Well, I'm not -- I'm not a chain smoker, I don't smoke often.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Every once in a while.  I don't, um, I don't really smoke every day.
L:  Oh, well --
R:  So --
L:  -- that's good.  Yeah, I -- I guess, uh, if, you know, all those people, I -- I shouldn't mind anybody else's business until it affects me or my family, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  And, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think it's good for the population to hear the negatives on TV, the --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- so -- so they know that the choices they're make --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the choice that they're making, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what they're for, but ... so, is this your first time?
R:  Yes, um, actually, I've had, uh, like, four other calls, but I never was able to talk on the phone to it.
L:  Oh.
R:  Either I was busy or --
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  -- I just didn't know what to talk about. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Yeah, this my third time, so I would --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I would like to do it again, but, um, I think I've talked to somebody from New York and Missouri, and now California. [LAUGH]
R:  You're from Minnesota?
L:  Minnesota, up by Duluth.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live in Oaklands in California.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Actually, the s- -- our small town, uh, there is no smoking in any public building here or restaurants.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- it's available to the smokers that want to, just to go five miles away to restaurants there, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I think it's a fair issue.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, that's fair.
L:  I don't know if it's fair to the restaurants, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess any business here, and there's ups and downs to -- to any of the thing -- laws that they have to abide by.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  None -- I --
R:  I don't -- I don't ever smoke before I eat or anything like that so, I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I won't sit in the restaurant and just smoke, [LAUGH] I don't do that, and I've -- I've never have, so --
L:  Mhm.  Evidently you don't have a strong addiction to the --
R:  No.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think when you overdo anything, food or -- or a- -- or anything you overdo is bad for you.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Well, my Dad smoked and -- and, uh, he was eighty when he died, so I guess he -- he lived a fair life f- for -- for what he did, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You just never know, it's a -- it's a gamble. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Does your husband smoke?
R:  No, I'm not married.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm actually -- I'm a student.
L:  You're what?
R:  I'm a student.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah.  So, I'm not there yet. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I mean --
L:  Well, I have three daughters and they don't smoke and, uh --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- they didn't see their parents smoke, and I think that probably has something to do with it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I hope. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my father smokes.  My mother doesn't, or my sister.  So ...
L:  And a lot of the people I notice now that smoke go outside to smoke, so that's good.
R:  Mhm.  Uh, [several inaudible words].  Yeah, I mean, it's nice talking to you about this.  Um, this is my first time, so ...
L:  Well, I was hoping it was somebody that agreed with me, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I g- -- I guess we're -- we're doing okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] Yeah, I heard, um, back in the day, they used to, um, what -- you used to be able to smoke on -- on school campuses.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, that's what my teacher told me, that when he was younger --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, I was, like, "What?  I never heard of that".  Well --
L:  We live by a high school and there's a lot of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- smoking going, but they do have to be off the grounds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they even have to worry about junior high kids --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm mm.  Oh.
L:  I think they're too young to make that decision.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then that's the way the world is going, not for any of their adult decisions, they're allowed to seemingly make them at very -- at a very young age.
R:  Mhm.  I think the commercials that are on TV are -- are good.  I mean, I think -- 'cause a lot of -- a lot of the kids, teenagers and youngsters, they watch TV, and the commercials, I know they pay attention to the commercials.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there is plenty of those anti drug commercials.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And those -- I mean, I -- I saw that one cigarette commercial where, um, they -- I guess the cigarette people, they were looking at a cigarette and talking about how they're supposed to have these little microscopic holes in it that are supposed to reduce the tar --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but it doesn't, and so they were talking about that and just looking at the cigarette or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they may think they're not listening to it, but it's planting the seed and it -- and it's at least letting them know the choice that they're making.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm just glad that I never got that addiction, because I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sure it's very hard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- I like to eat, and I know when I feel eating, it's kind of hard to put it out of your mind. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I don't know.  [MN]
L:  Is your town, uh, can you smoke in restaurants then there?
R:  Um, there's -- there's quite a few restaurants here that allows it in certain areas of the restaurant.
L:  Okay.  Our town is only, like, twelve thousand, so, uh-huh.
R:  Oh, yeah, 'cause I used to live in a small town, but Oakland is pretty big.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't know if you've heard the -- about the killings and all that stuff that's been going on here --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- last year, and now it's, uh, right now that's [several inaudible words]
L:  Is that scary for you?
R:  Yeah, i- i- it is, because I live in the area. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] east part of Oakland and that's where I live.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I know, uh, two people that -- from last year that died.
L:  Oh, that's terrible.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Yeah, we're pretty sheltered in our town, I mean, you'll have an incident, you know, uh, probably once every five, ten years, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't have to ... to, uh, really be afraid to go out.  So, I -- and that's what I like about this town. [LAUGH]
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  But, [SIGH] I guess we're supposed to talk about smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think we've covered the -- [LAUGH] we know how each other feels, huh?
R:  You haven't had any -- any family ever that had to go to rehab or anything?
L:  No.
R:  Hm.  Well, I've had, um, teachers, you know, my past teachers telling me about how, um, their family members suffered from smoking and how they all -- and my sister, um, she told me that she had that famous person, um, that used to be on those tobacco commercials, the lady with the hole in her net --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- she came to her class --
L:  Really?
R:  -- but just -- just this, um, this week, I think it was on Tuesday, yesterday.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, yeah, and sh- -- they were -- she was talking and everything.  I don't know, my sister said she was very rude, but I think -- 'cause they were trying to a- ask the -- ask her questions and everything and she took it very -- I guess obsessively --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or something. [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  Well, that's good for --
