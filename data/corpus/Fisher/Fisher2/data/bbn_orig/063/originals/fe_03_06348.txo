R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Kelly, I live in Wisconsin.
L:  Hi.  I'm Rhonda and I'm in, uh, Little Rock, Arkansas.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, do you wanna start, or [LAUGH] --
L:  Um, well, um, this is my first time, so, I don't know if you've done it before. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You go ahead.
R:  This is, um, I think about my fourth call now, and I -- I just read that there was a limit of three, but apparently not. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, anyway, um, I guess, sure, I can start.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm a non smoker, um, I never have smoked, um, both of my parents did and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there were four kids in our family and it's kind of funny, 'cause none of us started to smoke, which is kind of odd, you'd think one of us would have done it, but, [SIGH] um --
L:  That's good. [LAUGH]
R:  Actually, now, my mother, um, was a smoker for, I believe, forty years.  She quit sh- -- five years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess, as far as I'm concerned, I'd -- I'd -- since I was around smokers my whole life, I'm not one of those real, um, [LIPSMACK] tough people whose, you know --
L:  M- mhm .
R:  -- makes comments when they see people smoking or anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, it's kind of funny, my mom's more like that, being the ex smoker, she's, you know, much more rude, I think, to smokers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I just kinda, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- go my own way, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if I do go to a restaurant or something, I do always ask for the non smoking section which, in our area, most of the restaurants now are all non smoking, so it's really not even an issue in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, Madison and -- and around where I live, so --
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  Well, um, I'm a non smoker also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I, um, you know, never really, um, well, I think I -- I may have tried it, um, f- for a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a maybe a few minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm, like, no way, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I say, "I don't see how people can do this.  This is so nasty". [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my -- my father, he smoked and, um, well, my mother, you know, she did for a little while, but she s- soon stopped and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, you know, and it's, like, in my family I have, um, just about -- I have, uh, two sisters that smoked --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I have a brother that smokes [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have -- it's, um, I have three sisters and three brothers and -- and it's three of 'em that smokes and of course the other three don't and -- including myself, I don't smoke.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I just -- I don't know, it's, like, when I am around any type of -- it's just, like, when I smell it, you know, it really bothers me, it gives me headaches and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just can't really, um, uh, tolerate it, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really much at all and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I just, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, um, you know, I'm kind of glad they're, you know, doing a different dance, you know, with the cigarette smoking in, you know, i- in public places, in, you know, certain places because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that does impose on, you know, non smokers, you know, who doesn't.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  I think so too, and especially --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, with -- with kids and -- and things, I -- you know, I -- I definitely prefer for them to be in a smoke free environment and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and even when my first child was born, my mother still smoked and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I know, I would just, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she would -- if she came to visit me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she knew that my house was smoke free and she would go outside --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and, um, so I -- I don't mind, like, anything being, um, smoke free as far as, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- their rights, I think, like you said, there's, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we non smokers have rights too, to have --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- clean air and I think, you know, as far as any smoking cessation programs or anything, I'm all for those.  I know that when my mother quit, she used, uh, the patch and the Zyban medication to help her quit and I think [SIGH] that, um, [LIPSMACK] insurance covering that is fine, because in the long -- long run, you know, hopefully it will --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- help prevent a lot of the health problems.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  And so I'd rather see us paying for, you know, helping people quit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than to, you know, pay for lung cancer treatments --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and things like that.
L:  I know.
R:  So --
L:  You know, I had a chance a -- a few years back, I was working as a nurse assistant and, uh, my -- one of my patients was, she had lung cancer.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, and I never seen, you know, anybody that had that and, of course, uh, you know, she was giving up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, she was dying, and it was a horrible -- I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she was really, you know, and she was still craving those cigarettes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah.
L:  And she had the oxygen thing and everything and -- and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and it was real scary, because, you know, we was afraid she would light one of those up with that oxygen and --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm telling you --
R:  I know exactly what you mean.
L:  -- and I was, like, "I gotta get away from here".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was just -- she suffered real -- you know, it was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a horrible way and I just see how, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- lung cancer can really just -- you know, if you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people have it, they really suffer.
R:  Mhm, well --
L:  And it's not a pretty sight at all.
R:  No.
L:  Mm mm.
R:  No, I've --
L:  It's not.
R:  -- I've worked with those people too, I'm a nurse too, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I, um, have worked in nursing homes, same thing, where you see the older people, especially with their -- even my grandfather was like that, had his oxygen tank and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, had emphysema and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- still just, you know, would turn off his oxygen and then go smoke and then go turn his oxygen back on and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- y- yeah, it was scary, you always [LAUGH] hope they --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- always remember that oxygen off. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  But, uh --
L:  I know.  Well, you know, it's -- you know, and a lot of people are becoming aware of it, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, um, you know, that even the secondhand smoke is -- is -- is not good for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for you, because, uh, you know, it can, you know, cause problems, you know, health problems too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  But, um, I just wish they would just do away with the -- just everything [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with that, you know?
R:  Well, it's kind of funny, because I don't -- I don't know what the statistics are as far as [NOISE] -- just a minute, Shannon -- if -- yeah, you can go -- as far as if people are smoking less or not, but I know, like, with my kids, they always -- if they see somebody smoking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they think that that's really strange, and I know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, when I grew up it was the norm, most people did smoke [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I'm hoping that that means that people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- aren't smoking as much as they did, or I'm hoping --
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  -- that, you know, that my kids will learn that that's, you know, not the normal thing to do and, you know, hopefully --
L:  Right.  And it's not cool, either. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  And that's what -- you know, I try to teach 'em --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- teach 'em that, but, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I don't want them to go up to strangers and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- say rude comments. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH] That could be a problem, but [LAUGH] --
L:  That can be, it sure can.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  Yes, indeed.  But, um, I just, um, you know, I'm glad, like you say, a lot of, um, awareness about it is, you know, and information, you know, it's coming out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about it, so, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  And then, you know, with the warnings, you know, that's good that they are posting a lot of that, you know, so people will be aware and know, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, what s- smoking can really do for you, you know, it's not a thing --
R:  Right.  Oh, I think definitely more than, [MN] you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, even ten or twenty years ago, they -- they have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so many more ads about the [SIGH] the negative side to smoking and I would think even the cost would [MN] discourage some people, or -- or help encourage some people to quit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, you know, how people can even afford to smoke, [LAUGH] I don't --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- I don't know.  'Cause it's, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- outrageously expensive and --
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know, I -- I ride the bus to work and this morning, one of the passengers got up off the bus and he left a pack of cigarettes on there and they was trying to tell him he left his cigarettes, but he didn't hear, so the bus driver, he asked what kind it was, and they say, "Marlboroughs" and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he said, "Oh" he say, "Great" so he [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when he came to the stop, he stopped and -- and came back there and got the cigarettes and he was talking about, "You know how much these cigarettes cost?" 'cause I think it was, like, five dollars or something, he was saying.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  He was just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, glad he got to have a free pack of cigarettes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I bet, if they --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, if they're running that much.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  But, anyway, but, you know, like I say, you know, it's good they got the, you know, a lot of the, um, advertising out about, you know, how, you know, smoking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is -- is not good for your health, and it's really not, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  It's not good for you at all.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the more they advertise, I think the more it will help and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the more they offer different things, like now they have the gum and the patch and the [SIGH] medication and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then there's behavior therapy, hypnosis [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it seems like there's so many different things to try that hopefully people could find something that will work for them, [SIGH] and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And -- and be able to quit more easily.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- um, you know, and then if they do start making the laws more strict too, I mean, it would just -- pretty soon, you'd think people would just wanna quit just because it -- it just becomes too difficult to be --
L:  Too difficult, yeah.
R:  -- a smoker, I mean, and to --
L:  Right, right, exactly.
R:  -- to have to try to find a place to smoke or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you always see those smokers out in the winter time [LAUGH] freezing and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know? [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I said I don't see how they can -- every time we have a break on our job and they say, "Okay, smoke break".  It's always --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a smoke -- I'm, like, "Why can't it just be a break?" [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it's -- we have, I think we have more people, and it's amazing, more people -- and I know in my o- office they've -- you know, more people smoke and they run and take their little ten minute smoke break and then --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then they come back and, um --
