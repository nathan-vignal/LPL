L:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Kathy[?]. [NOISE]
R:  Hi, Kathy.  This is Twyla[?].
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  Busy at work --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but other than that fine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wet -- well, wet, it's raining like crazy.
R:  Oh, here too.  Here too. [LAUGH]  So, how do you feel about this law they're trying to pass?
L:  Well, I smoke --
R:  [inaudible].  Okay.
L:  Do you?
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  So, um -- I mean, we ha- -- um, I work at, you know, hospitals and there -- you know, there's a lot of places we can't smoke and, you know, I think it's, you know, against us, but I understand their feelings.
R:  Well, I'm a nurse.
L:  [COUGH] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm a hospice nurse --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- and we all have to die of something. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes and so I figure.
R:  And, ah, I don't feel that people's rights should be violated.
L:  I don't think so either, but you know, I understand the reasoning here.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I have to go like fifty feet away from the building to smoke.
R:  Um, if a business chooses to have a not -- no smoking [NOISE], um, that's their choice --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I don't feel that the state or the city or the county --
L:  Yeah, they're government [several inaudible words] into it.
R:  -- has the right to tell me I can't walk into a sports club -- sports bar and have a cigarette while I'm watching the game.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't, ah -- and as far as the -- the medications and programs to stop smoking --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- been there, done that, don't work.
L:  I know.
R:  I've -- I --
L:  Tried them -- tried the patch, tried the smoking cessation.
R:  Well, I had nightmares using the patch.
L:  I couldn't sleep.
R:  Oh yeah, but I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's like you were drunk and you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had nightmares.  I was like -- oh, I'd wake up, um, have insomnia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I even tried hypnosis.  Didn't help.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know?  Um --
L:  Because I don't smoke at home, I just smoke at work and in my car.
R:  I smoke at home, I smoke in my car.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Um, I have an eight year old --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and his --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- mother died of cancer.
L:  Oh.
R:  He's under the impression, anybody that smokes, that's what causes cancer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The way the government portrays smoking, smoking is the evil of everything.  Smoking causes everything.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  And I told him, "No, your mum didn't die from lung cancer or throat cancer".
L:  Right.  Didn't -- yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I've had those talks with my grandkids.
R:  Oh, you're a gramma too huh?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I've got six of those little [inaudible].
L:  Where are you at?
R:  I'm in New Jersey.
L:  I'm in Virginia.
R:  And my ba- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my babies are all in Arizona.
L:  Yeah, mine -- well, mine are actually twenty minutes from home.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Two of the oldest ones live with me until two years ago and now they're all back with their mom, thank the Lord.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But yeah they -- they -- my oldest two were like, "Well, you know, this one died of cancer [several inaudible words]" "But not that type of cancer, there's different kinds --
R:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words] --
L:  "-- and smoking doesn't give them to you".
R:  Yeah, it's like my little guy and, ah, his brother's going to be eleven and his brother's told him that his mother died of cancer because she smoked and she died of basal cell carcinoma.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But everything the schools teach, everything the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the government teaches and --
L: Yeah.
R:   -- you listen to someone -- you listen -- I had a doctor when my daughter was pregnant [NOISE] I went in, she was having a hard -- they did -- did an ultrasound on her [NOISE] and we got to see the baby in like the two week embryonic stage --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was just fantastic --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you could see the yolk --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you could see the little tiny string of an umbilical cord --
L:  Ooh, neat.
R:  -- and -- and the little itty bitty, you know, zygote or whatever you want to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to call it, you know, the -- the -- the little tiny fetus.  And I said -- you know what, I said, "Her and her husband need to share this".  I said, "I'm going to go out and have a cigarette" and the doctor looked at me and said, "Oh, do I have to get on my 'Do you know what happens from smoking lecture?'" and the nurses started to chuckle and I says, "And do I have to get on my 'I'm a hospice nurse and we all have to die from something'?".
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I -- I says, "I take care of more people that are dying from AIDS and -- and cancers, other than lung cancer, and everything else".  I says, "Than I do people dying from lung cancer from smoking or emphysema".  And he goes, "Oh, okay". [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the doctor wanted to ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's like re- -- like a, you know, a -- a reformed alcoholic, you know, they want to push it on everybody and I don't think they should be able to push it on me.
R:  [NOISE] You know, I -- I -- I --
L:  I [SIGH] --
R:  -- I respect other people's spaces.
L:  Yes, I understand what you're on.
R:  I will not smoke in a non smoker's car.
L:  No.
R:  I will not smoke in a non smoker's house.  I've gone out and sat on a street curb to have a cigarette.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  There's been times when I haven't felt well and I'm a sm- -- I'm a heavy smoker and I've asked people, you know, "Hey, my asthma's bothering me, I'm not smoking, could you please not smoke in my house?".
L:  Yes.
R:  Nobody was offended.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] But nobody's going to blame my smoking on everybody else's illnesses --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you know, that just -- I'm a nurse, I know better [LIPSMACK] and I know doctors that smoke and don't tell people --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- try and hide it. [NOISE]
L:  Yep, I do too here.  Yeah.
R:  But ah, I can see no smoking in a hospital.  I can see no smoking in clinics.  I can see no smoking -- like I said if --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- if a restaurant chooses not to smoke, that's fine.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] In the city of [inaudible] Arizona, if you get -- or is [inaudible] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  no it's [inaudible].  If you get caught smoking -- you get arrested if you're smoking in public.
L:  That's not fair, we're not second class citizens.
R:  [NOISE] I -- I -- I saw the police watch a -- a waitress come out of the restaurant, sit in her car to have a cigarette --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and when she opened the door to co-- go back to work and the smoke came out of her car, they arrested her.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my Lord. [NOISE] You all have a nice day.
R:  So, you're at work huh?
L:  Uh-huh, I'm working in neurology department, ch- child and epilepsy.
R:  [NOISE] Now, do you -- how often do you participate in these surveys?
L:  This is my first one.
R:  This is my first one, too.
L:  [LAUGH] Because I was -- I belong to a bunch of boards, you know trading boards and stuff --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I got it off of that.
R:  What are those?
L:  It's ref- -- [inaudible] -- for coupons and stuff.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm a big refunder and couponer.
R:  I used to do that a lot.  No, this is my first one.
L:  Yes.
R:  And at least I got into -- got a regular smoker. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.  So --
R:  I don't -- you know, I don't try and -- I don't want to violate anybody else's rights --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but nobody has the right --
L:  No.
R:  -- to tell me --
L:  Right.  Big brother can't tell me what to do.
R:  -- what I want to do.
L:  I know.
R:  [NOISE] Ah --
L:  And I've listened to all the reasons and the whys and everything and I'm like, "Okay".
R:  Oh, I've got friends of mine that are attorneys --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and judges and they smoke and they said, "Well, how do you feel about this?  What is they pass this law?".  I said, "They passed that law, I'll smoke wacky weed".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I said, "Nobody's going to tell me I can't smoke".  I said, "Why don't they -- they turn around and -- and tell all these alcoholic politicians they're not allowed to have their booze anymore?".
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think it does more damage than cigarettes do.
R:  I said, "Do you really think outlawing cigarette smoke is going to stop smoking?".  I says, "It doesn't stop booze" I said, "During prohibition.  It's not going to stop people from smoking".  You know?
L:  [NOISE] Mm. [NOISE]
R:  And I look at it this way, if I'm in a restaurant --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that allows smoking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] -- if I'm in a restaurant that allows smoking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and someone comes in and my smoking bothers them, then they need to leave --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- because they know that's a smoking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- restaurant or a smoking bar --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean, they have the same ch- -- you know, they can have the choice not to be there and we should be able to have the choice too.
R:  I mean, my husband and I have gone into very, very nice restaurants and clubs where they were non smoking.  [NOISE] I knew they were non smoking, I didn't attempt to make a scene --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because we chose to go into that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- particular restaurant. [NOISE]
L:  I understand.
R:  But the people that choose to come into a -- a restaurant [NOISE] or, like I said, a sports bar or whatever where they allow smoking, have no beef about my secondhand smoke.  They know people in there are smoking.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] How do you feel about that?
L:  Mm -- I [inaudible] -- I think that's right, too.  You know, if they come in and they know it's smoking, then they shouldn't beef.  Just like, you know, when I take -- go to a restaurant or to the movies and you can't smoke, I choose to go there so I don't smoke.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, it's your choice.  I don't think anyone should be able to, you know -- to tell me [several inaudible words] not to be able to do it.
R:  That's like my daughters.  My daughters were heavy smokers.  Every time they got pregnant they went down to one or two cigarettes a day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I said, "You can go one or two cigarettes a day for nine months, you can quit". [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And they just kind of looked at me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] I said, "If I was only smoking one or two cigarettes a day, I'd be dumb.  That would be it".  But you know, there are times I was ill, I was in intensive care for a month.  I hadn't had a cigarette or anything in almost two months and my doctor went aw- -- went out of town [NOISE] and the doctor that took over from him picked up the chart and all he read was, "History of chronic tobacco abuse" right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I hadn't had a cigarette --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- in almost two months.  What does this man do without my permission?  Orders nicotine patches and within two days before I figured out what was
