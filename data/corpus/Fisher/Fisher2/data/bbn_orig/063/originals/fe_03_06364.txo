R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm --
R:  Um --
L:  Go ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm Mike Dunn[?].
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  M- Michael Dunn.
L:  Michael Dunn?  I'm Laura.
R:  Yeah, how are you doing, I'm Laura?  Do you smoke?
L:  Um, I don't.  Do you?
R:  Yes.
L:  You do?  Okay.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Which is okay.
L:  Let's see, where -- where do you live?
R:  I'm in Tennessee.
L:  Okay.  I'm from North Carolina originally, but I'm in Rhode Island.
R:  Oh, okay.  Good [inaudible]
L:  So not very far away.
R:  No, not really.
L:  Um, what --
R:  So, h- how do you feel about actually -- about --
L:  Um --
R:  -- smoking in public places?
L:  Let's see.  Well, [SIGH] I'm [SIGH] -- let's see. [LAUGH] [SIGH] I'm not really sure, i- -- [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] it's -- I don't know, I can't see that it would happen.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's [MN] [SIGH] -- what I would think [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my concern is, like when there is, like, a -- a no smoking section and a smoking section --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I'm in the non smoking section, I can usually s- still, you know, smell the cigarette smoke.
R:  Smell the cigarettes, yeah.
L:  So, I don't know if -- [SIGH] I mean, [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know if it really helps but, I mean, for someone that does smoke, it doesn't seem right that you wouldn't be able to enjoy a place like that, so --
R:  Yeah, I can see your point.  I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I, ah, quit smoking for over a year and a half.
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, and I know that when I didn't smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I could always tell somebody who did smoke, because they s- smelt on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- their clothes.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you could always -- always tell.  When I worked in a rest- -- at a restaurant at the time that I didn't smoke, I could always pin whether they were to be seated in the smoking section or not in the smoking section --
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  -- just, [NOISE] you know, just by smelling them before they got there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- but I know some states have outlawed smoking in the public.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And honestly, I mean, [NOISE] that's okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I figure if w- -- if those of us who want to smoke, if we want to stand outside and freeze our little patuti off --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- to smoke a cigarette, that's our choice.
L:  Right.
R:  And we shouldn't have to torture everybody else --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who chooses not to smoke.
L:  Right, I kinda look at it from -- it's, like, I have two young children and so whenever, you know, [LIPSMACK] not so much even for me, I mean, obviously health wise I don't wanna be breathing it in but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I look at my children and think, you know, I don't want them to [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Right, to start smoking.
L:  -- breathe the secondhand smoke, so --
R:  Agreed, agreed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, like I said, I -- I have -- I've got a son --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and because I smoke, every time I turn around, his favorite thing is to get my cigarettes.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and -- and he -- he mimics what I do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, because I smoke, he's taking them out of the pack, he's putting them in his mouth, he's playing with them.
L:  Right.
R:  I hate myself, because I started smoking again --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a year ago, because of the fact that he does do that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I would prefer him to be able to grow up and say no.
L:  Right.
R:  It's hard being a smoker, telling your child not to smoke --
L:  Right, because they --
R:  -- because, well, now I'm --
L:  -- follow your example.
R:  -- a hypocrite.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Because I smoke and -- and, "Oh, but it -- but you do, so how come I can't?"
L:  Right.
R:  "Well, because you don't understand --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- that when you do smoke, [NOISE] it's too hard --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- to give them up --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- once you have started this habit".
L:  Right.
R:  Now, I don't know if any of the medications that they have got --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, online or, um, that's out there now actually do work. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  I know I've got a friend that's in the process of taking medication to quit smoking [NOISE].  It has made her, uh, lose her appetite.
L:  Really?  Well, I've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wondered, like, about the patches, because then you wouldn't be getting, [MN] you know, you'd be getting the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nicotine, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to control the cra- -- I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't if that would, um [several inaudible words]
R:  W- well, you know, this is what a lot of people don't understand --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is it's not so much the nicotine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that is the addiction, [NOISE] it's the bite from the cigarettes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that you get in the back of your throat, that's the addiction.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  I didn't realize.
R:  -- they're hitting all this with the nicotine --
L:  Right.
R:  -- thinking that that's what really the addiction is --
L:  But that's --
R:  -- and it's not.
L:  And even probably just [MN] the habit, I would think, of, you know, having it in your hand and, I don't know, just the process of smoking, I guess. [MN] I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Well, e- e- even when I stopped smoking it, you know, [NOISE] I didn't have a problem with [NOISE] not being able to have something in my hand --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like I said, it's not the nicotine, it's not what you do with your hands --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] again, it's the bite that you get from the cigarettes in the back of your [NOISE] throat that causes it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to be an addiction. [NOISE]
L:  Hm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I didn't --
R:  And a lot of people --
L:  -- I have never heard that before, I never realized it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, see, and everyone likes to -- and [NOISE] from being a smoker --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and quitting and starting back up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's what it was that I missed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it wasn't the nicotine and going through the withdraws --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was the bite in the back of my throat every time that I took a drag --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that it was that I was missing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's -- eventually I just said, "Okay". I -- [NOISE] I went a year and a half without smoking --
L:  Wow, that's great.
R:  -- and --
L:  That's a long time. [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah, it -- it -- well, it -- well, I smoked for seventeen years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I quit, and I got under a lot of stress --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just reached over one day and grabbed one out of somebody's hand and said, "I dare you to take it from me".
L:  Yeah, I've heard that it's -- but my, um, [LIPSMACK] my in laws actually, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my mother in law had quit, um, but then my father in law would still smoke occasionally and, you know, whenever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he would it was just, you know, so hard for her and it just seemed, you know, being around someone else that's still smoking, so it was very hard.
R:  Mm, it is harder to quit when somebody else is smoking.
L:  Mhm.  I don't --
R:  It definitely is.
L:  -- yeah, I don't know if it would ever come to the point where they'd be able to ban it but, I don't know.  I'm --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I know, for in- -- in my home state, North Carolina, that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, it's such a part of the industry there that I -- I don't know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I can't -- and I'm sure, I mean, even -- 'cause I just can't see it happening, but I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] Well, how do you feel about, uh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- these people that sue the cigarette companies --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then the state gets the money from the tobacco companies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they don't put that money towards the anti smoking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- th- -- like Tennessee works that money into their budget.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And -- yeah.  And then it goes into everybody's pocket --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to -- to fund everything, instead of them actually using that money [NOISE] to be anti smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I wish they would use it that way, but they don't.
L:  Right.
R:  Once they get it, they put in their budget [NOISE] to fund -- fund their pocket, basically --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  And I don't think that's right.
L:  Mm.  I don't know.  Definitely a big -- big money maker, I'm sure, for them. [SIGH] How much is a -- a -- a pack of cigarettes?  I actually don't even know.  Is it --
R:  Um, depending on what you smoke [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, I smoke generic cigarettes, so I don't pay any more than a dollar fifty a pack.
L:  Okay.
R:  But if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I were to be smoking a name brand cigarette --
L:  Right.
R:  -- say, like Camels or Marlboro, [NOISE] you're talking at least three dollars a pack now.
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- and I know are a lot of people are onto, you know, the -- the big cigarettes, and that's why I'm smoking the generics because I'm not going to pay that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- much money for a pack of cigarettes.
L:  Right.
R:  And when I have to start paying that much money for a pack of cigarettes, they're gone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't care how much it [NOISE] kills me.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] It's -- it's worth it to me to quit smoking because of the money that I'm spending.
L:  How did you -- did you just quit cold turkey before whenever you --
R:  Yes, I did.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] And, uh --
L:  Was that really hard? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, you're -- you're -- one day you just get up and you decide, "I'm done".
L:  Right.
R:  And that's what I did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And just the same way I started back up again [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, one day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- somebody just really made me so mad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I just said, "If I don't, I'm going to hurt them".
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I just reached over and I grabbed a cigarette and I said, "Okay [NOISE] --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- here we go again".
L:  Hm.
R:  And I wish I -- I'm -- I'd like to throw 'em down again [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I have to get mad enough at myself [NOISE] to do it.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Got to be determined.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hm.  Well, and what --
R:  You know, I think cigars are not as bad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because you don't inhale the cigar --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you just, like, let it sit in your mouth and then you --
L:  And then you --
R:  -- you -- exhale the smoke, yeah.  So, I think those are really probably more healthier for you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than the actual cigarette itself.
L:  Do you have any, um, [LIPSMACK] is there anywhere where you live that it -- it is banned, that smoking is banned, in bars or a- -- you know?
R:  Um, there's restaurants and stuff that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that are non smoking restaurants.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, we have [NOISE] buildings that, you know, where you work and stuff that you're not allowed to smoke in, but there's always a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- smokers' area [NOISE] --
L:  Just go outside.
R:  -- right [NOISE] outside the building.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so --
L:  Hm.
R:  But, um, w- which state was it that banned smoking everywhere in the public?
L:  Oh, I'm not sure.
R:  I -- I know that one of the states had recently did that.
L:  I'm not sure where it was.
R:  Yeah, and I -- I thought that was kind of a little crazy, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if they needed -- if they felt that they needed to go that extreme to make --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- people happy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then so be it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, even though I am a smoker and I don't agree with it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I live there, obviously I would have to abide by it and it may even give me more of a will to quit smoking.
L:  Mhm.  If it wasn't -- yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Wasn't as easy to.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Hm.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  My goodness.  And I do think they need to -- to get more education out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on the not smoking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really.
L:  Definitely.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm amazed at how many, like, young people I see, you know, that are walking around smoking just because, [SIGH] I don't know --
R:  It's the hip thing to do.
L:  -- they've got -- they've got to know [LAUGH] by now about the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about the health, you know, consequences.
R:  Well, now -- [NOISE] now they're trying to make it the -- the -- that it's hip not to smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And to be honest with you, I think they really should do that. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, um, I've known people who have died from cancer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they smoke cigarettes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, then I know people who have never smoked in their life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yet they still died from the same cancer.
L:  Mhm.
