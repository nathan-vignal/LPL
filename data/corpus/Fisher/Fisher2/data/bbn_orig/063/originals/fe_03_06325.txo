L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Cynthia[?].
L:  Hi, my name is Adrienne[?].
R:  Hi, Adrienne.  How are you today?
L:  Oh, good thank you and how about yourself?
R:  I'm doing great, thanks.  So, do you have strong feelings about the topic of whether we should ban smoking or not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in public places?
L:  You know, I -- recently I've just started hearing about it a little bit on the news and so I've -- I haven't really fully formed an opinion, but I'm a non smoker.  Are you a non smoker? [NOISE]
R:  I am a non smoker, so.
L:  But -- but you know what, the problem that I'm having too is that I have, ah, four children and sometimes we'll go to a restaurant and it is so awful because they'll say they have a non smoking section, really it's just a table over.  You know, it might be --
R:  I know.
L:  -- it might just be blocked by what a -- a half of a wall --
R:  I know, that --
L:  -- you know what I'm saying?
R:  -- that has happened to us so often and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Do you have children?
R:  W- -- my daughter's grown, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when we go out it --
L:  But you know -- but you're -- but -- and -- but you know what I'm talking about too?
R:  I do know exactly what you're talking -- in fact, we --
L:  It's horrid.
R:  -- went out the other night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It is, we were sitting outside --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- having coffee the [LAUGH] other night and they -- and, I mean, even outside the smoke -- you know, the smoke was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- bo- -- I mean, you couldn't sit and enjoy --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you know, what you were eating.
L:  I know.  I agree.
R:  But I haven't -- but I have mixed emotions because um --
L:  Me too.  Me too.
R:  -- I was in Phoenix, Arizona and there's an area out in there that -- um, this community called Mafa[?] they have banned smoking --
L:  Oh, have they?
R:  -- and a -- and a lot of their --
L:  Where do you -- where do you live?
R:  I live in Tennessee.  Where do you live?
L:  Okay, I'm in Missouri.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I was visiting out there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my da- -- my daughter lives out there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a- and they were saying that a lot of the bars and restaurants are being hur- -- you know, business owners are being hurt --
L:  Really?
R:  -- be- because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people that like to smoke, especially bars --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't want to go in- -- you know, that kind of smoking and drinking, I guess, for a lot of people go hand in hand.
L:  Right.  Right.  Uh-huh.
R:  A- and they said it's kind of a um -- that they -- a lot of people believe that, you know, it should be left up to the individual --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, owner to decide if he wants to allow smoking --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in his restaurant or not a- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but somewhat mixed emotions being like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you are, a non smoker.  I don't want to smell it when I go into a restaurant.
L:  I know.  You know it's really overpowering and, um --
R:  It --
L:  -- my daughter, she -- um, she has, um, asthma, it's a very mild asthma, so it -- smoking doesn't necessarily bring on the asthma but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it bothers her and, you know, anything -- any strong odors and things like that really bother her --
R:  Oh, that's awful.
L:  -- but it bothers all of us though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know -- I mean, i- in one way -- in one way I think that people should be allowed to smoke in public places.  You know, like -- I mean, w- -- but on the other hand, I mean, to me it's like fifty fifty.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, on the one hand, you know, I -- if -- if they would never allow smoking again, I wouldn't protest it, believe me.
R:  No, neither would I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but -- but I also think that -- you know, the -- living in the United States and -- and being an American we're entitled to certain rights and what makes my --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- I mean, I'm -- I have mixed emotions.  What makes my view, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- better than the smoker's view.  Although -- you know, when you talk about health issues, it's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, why should your daughter not be able to go into a restaurant and enjoy a meal, because she can't breathe.
L:  I know it.  And you know here in Missouri it's really interesting.  I've been hearing about this on the radio, actually it's the Saint Louis, ah, metropolitan area --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where they've -- they've, um, compiled a list where you can get on the internet and it's a list of one hundred restaurants that don't allow any smoking, at all.
R:  Really?
L:  And I thought, "Man, that is cool" you know?  Because then it --
R:  And that's great.  No, I like that.  Yeah.
L:  That is really great, I -- it's probably -- I don't know if it's spread to other, um, states, but um, you can go and, um -- and if you really have an aversion to it and you can look up and decide where you want to eat, based upon the fact that they don't allow smoking and you can't beat that.
R:  I think that's fantastic.
L:  You know?  You really can't.  It's great.
R:  Well, then again us non smokers will, you know, frequent those places --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and their -- their business will probably do really well and -- and so, I -- that's a great idea.  I'm going to have to check --
L:  I know, huh?
R:  -- into that and see if they have something like that where I live.
L:  I know.  Now, the interesting thing too is, um, every now and then, I would say probably it was six weeks ago, we go -- six weeks or so we go to the Denny's restaurant which is, um, in our neighborhood --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, like I was saying at the beginning of the conversation, that the smoking section is only divided by a table and a half of a -- a partition -- a half of a wall basically and it is really hard.  You know, they have tried to sit us so where in the so called non smoking section and we don't -- you know, we have turned it down.  It's the best table [NOISE] for our family -- because there's a lot of us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  There's a total of six of us that go --
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and -- but we just said, "No, we really don't want it because it's just -- we just simply don't want to be [NOISE] in an area where we can smell the cigarette smoke at all" --
R:  Yeah, it --
L:  -- but people aren't going to stop smoking.  You know, I -- I w- -- sometimes I ask my husband, I say, "Will people ever stop?" and they just won't.  I heard one woman on TV, um, they were just having a conversation and she said she just loves to smoke --
R:  You know, I --
L:  -- and so smoking's not going to stop. [LAUGH]
R:  See I don't understand it --
L:  I don't either.
R:  -- I mean years ago, maybe when --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but --
L:  When they didn't know?
R:  When they didn't know, but now with all the information out --
L:  I know.
R:  -- about what it does to your health --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and all the cancer -- but that brings up again, why are all these people able to sue all these tobacco companies now?
L:  Isn't it outrageous?
R:  I think it's ridiculous.
L:  It's the most outrageous thing.  For billions of dollars.
R:  Well, our society --
L:  For billions.
R:  -- is such a litigious society, it's disgusting because we're paying for these people that are smoking -- I mean, one way or another, you know? [LAUGH] It's coming out of --
L:  One way or another, we're paying for it.
R:  -- all of our pockets.  Right.
L:  That's true.  That's absolutely true.
R:  But -- and they know when they light up now.  I mean --
L:  I know it.
R:  -- unless you live in a ho- -- in a cage. [LAUGH]
L:  I know it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but the thing is have you ever -- you know what?  The truth is -- this -- we have such an aversion to smoking in my family, my children because they grew up with, um -- um, anti smoking campaigns in school and I have a -- um, a fifteen year old, a fourteen year old, an eight year old and a -- he's, um, twenty months now --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and we find it amazing [LAUGH] when we see people still smoking, because they -- you know, it's like they -- they simply don't care.  I've -- I've come to that conclusion that people just don't care or nothing.  It's --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I don't believe in those -- to be honest, I guess it depends on what city and state you're in as to whether or not the smoking ban will actually take hold.  But I don't know, are there more smokers than non smokers?
R:  You know, I would think there were non -- more non smokers, but --
L:  You think so?
R:  -- did you hear -- I heard, a few weeks ago, that New York city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had put in a ban in all their restaurants and -- and clubs and everything but --
L:  You know, I think I've heard that -- about that too.  I think they did.
R:  And I'm -- we're --
L:  The city of New York huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  The city of New York and I'm really anxious to see how that turns out, because --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- you think of -- well, I think of New York as being a very, you know, lively --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, cultural place --
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.
R:  -- where you think that people are going to be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't ho- -- so, it'll be interesting to see how that turns out.  Do you think though -- you said that your kids were -- had all the campaigns in school and everything, do you think it really makes a difference?  I mean --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- do you think they --
L:  Boy, I cannot tell you, it really, truly makes a difference, because w- -- from -- from the earliest elementary grade up until they're now going into high school, they've had -- they've heard constantly about anti smoking and how bad it is for your health and because of that I really didn't have to do much at all --
R:  That's great.
L:  -- because they heard so much about it in school that they have an aversion towards it and I don't think my children would ever smoke.
R:  That's great.
L:  I really, truly don't and if they did, I would be surprised and you know?  But because they've heard so much anti smoking campaign- -- by the way, have you seen the, um -- I watch, um, MTV Cribs, that's the only time I ever watch MTV, but they have, um, some fascinating anti smoking, um, campaigns going on there.  Have you seen any of those lately?
R:  No, I haven't.  No.
L:  They're really interesting.  Th- -- what they do is they just basically, um, quote -- they have huge billboards that they've quoted what the, um, cigarette industry, um, CEOs have said over the years about smoking and how they've tried to cover up the, um -- the, um, dangers of smoking and it's, um, how, um -- um tobacco -- ah, not the tobacco but the, um -- what's in the cigarettes?
R:  Nicotine.
L:  Nicotine.  Yes, how nicotine is, um -- they tried to cover up the fact that it wasn't addictive, even though it's been proven that it is and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because of that they -- they use these fantastic anti smoking campaigns, basically in your face type of things and, um, they're really interesting.  They've had em on for probably about a year and a half to two years.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  So [SIGH] --
R:  Well, see I --
L:  -- smokers, I don't know -- I don't know what to [LAUGH] -- I don't know what to tell, like in a way I can feel sorry for em, you know?  I mean, I just can't.
R:  I don't feel sorry for em.  I mean, I really don't because I think --
L:  I just can't.  You know?
R:  -- there's enough out there.  I mean, our children --
L:  I know.
R:  -- are learning it in schools.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, everywhere you look --
L:  I know.
R:  -- there's something against smoking and telling you what it does to our health.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  So, I don't feel sorry for any of these people.  I mean, you -- and I don't want anybody to be sick or anything but --
L:  I know.
R:  -- these people know what they're getting into.  I mean, they --
L:  I know it.
R:  -- know what the chances are.  They're -- they're gambling with their -- their health --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- their lives.
L:  What a great risk it is, isn't it?  I mean, it's almost like it's a -- it's an in your face know- knowable risk --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you choose, you know?  I mean, peop- -- you know how people choose to drink alcohol, you know, where they -- if they happen to be an alcoholic?
R:  Right.
L:  And people will say, "Well, they're addicted to it" or whatever and cigarette -- cigarettes are fascinating in smokers because there's so many anti smoking campaigns, number one and number two if you want to quit smoking you go to the grocery store and you get that forty dollar, um, nicotine patch.  You know, the nicotine, um --
R:  Right.
