L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Felicia.
L:  Hi, my name is Jackie.
R:  Hi, Jackie.  Uh, now, I didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really catch all what she was saying.  We're supposed to be talking about, uh, smoking in public or the ads or what was it?
L:  Yeah, stuff about smoking in public and then how we feel about the ads to try to get   people to quit smoking.
R:  Well, I like the one, um, they have with the low weight birth babies.  Have you seen that one?
L:  Yeah, yeah, [NOISE] I've seen that one.
R:  That's a pretty good ad there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm a non smoker so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't like dealing with smoking in public. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't either. [NOISE] I always sit i- --
R:  I wish they would banned it in the clubs, but, or --
L:  Yeah, I know, you go in there and it's like you can't breathe at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, come home just smelling like a ashtray.
L:  Yeah, and then people think you smoke 'cause you smell like it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I don't know any other, um, advertisements over the smoking.
L:  Um, trying to think, there's those ones that's the truth behind the curtain or whatever.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, that's a good one too.
L:  Yeah, all those ones. [SIGH] But -- [NOISE] yeah, I mean, I don't know. [LAUGH] There's a lot of stuff in magazines too, I guess, like pictures and stuff. [NOISE] But --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess I just never really think about it, so I don't [NOISE] pay too much attention to it.
L:  Yeah, I always sit non smoking in places, so I'm never usually around it [NOISE] when I just go to restaurants and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I think now that the ban has went through, they don't really, uh, smoke in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in restaurants, do they?
L:  I know a lot of 'em are becoming, yeah, entirely non smoking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Which is good.  It's good, they can wait.
L:  Yeah, if people can't sit there and wait, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] they can get up and go outside too.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] It makes me mad when I see people with babies in the smoking section too. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like, exposing the poor little kid to that. [NOISE] I'm washing dishes right now, if you hear stuff clanging around. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's -- that's okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, that's okay.  I'm sitting up watching American Idol, so --
L:  [LAUGH] Is tonight the f- -- the final one?
R:  This is the final.
L:  Who do you want to win?  Reuben? [LAUGH]
R:  Reuben. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't like that other guy.
R:  I like Clay too.  I like him too, but that Reuben sounds just a little bit better.
L:  [LAUGH] I think that other guy's funny.
R:  [LAUGH] Funny looking.
L:  He's funny looking, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Probably a smoker.
L:  Yeah.  He's got little elf ears. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or his mother smoked --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- while he was in the womb. [LAUGH]
L:  I can't believe --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that girl got knocked off though.  I thought the girl -- I thought it would come down to Rueben and that Kimberley girl.
R:  Yeah, she was good too.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] 'cause that -- when that guy sang Grease or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that was terrible. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know why ten minutes seems so long on these --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- things.
L:  Well, I mean, they didn't give us a whole lot to talk about, I mean --
R:  No, mhm.
L:  -- if you haven't seen many ads, then [LAUGH] about two minutes into it and -- and that's all.
R:  Trying to think, in the magazines though, I don't remember seeing too many smoking ads.
L:  [NOISE] I'm trying to think.  There's t- -- there's some of those, um, those ones like truth behind the curtain things, they'll show pictures of 'em in magazines, but not even, like, a lot.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that -- that one is a good one.  Well, what was the one, um, where they got the paperwork, the executives had said, you know, how it was harmful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they thought they had shredded it up or something.
L:  Yeah, there's that one too where the guy said, um, the one guy from a cigarette company said he never knew anybody that died from -- from lung cancer that was caused from smoking and the one boy had, like, a big mural of his Dad painted up there or something, said that his Dad died from it.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah. [PAUSE]
L:  I don't know, I usually fast forward commercials. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] Trying to think, there was another one too I thought was good.  I can't think of it.
L:  Yeah, I mean, the main one I see is that one about the low birth weight babies.
R:  Mhm, yeah, they're playing that one quite a bit now.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Which is crazy, 'cause there were still, like, five people out of that whole survey that chose to have the little baby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, like, it's not even like the baby just looks small, it's looks, like, scary, [NOISE] like sickly. [NOISE]
R:  And, uh, I just don't get the cigarette, the what -- I mean, [LAUGH] why mess up with your baby --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for a -- a habit?
L:  Well, I had -- I have a cousin that smokes and drinks while she's pregnant, 'cause she said --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- "There's people that do it and their babies are perfectly fine".
R:  Mm.
L:  It's, like, yeah, and there's people that do it and their kids die, you know?  It's, like, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not something you'd wanna risk, [SIGH] but [SIGH] --
R:  And then I'm sure if they do -- go do the studies, you know, after they're grown, of course their IQ level is probably lower than the ones that -- mothers that didn't do that stuff.
L:  Yeah, and they develop allergies a lot easier, have breathing problems, stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And some of that won't show up for a few years, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it all affects them.  I don't know, some people just seem retarded. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Really do.  I know I'm getting a new phone, remember -- I got to try to remember this web address so I can change the number.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  Yeah, I'm thinking about having it so it goes to my cellphone too, 'cause then you can do, like, twice as many. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, see, I didn't even think about that.  I just had it going to my cell and that was it.
L:  Well, there's something like if you call 'em [NOISE] back, like if they call you and there's nobody else to talk to, if you call 'em back within, like, a couple of hours and enter your pin number --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then you can do it, like if there's somebody there.  You don't have to necessarily wait for them to call you again.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, see, I didn't know that.  My aunt was talking about it today, 'cause she gets all those, like, refunding magazines and gets online and does all kinds of stuff. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I do a lot of mystery shopping.  My cousin had sent me this link and she was, like, "And I got paid for it" and I was, like, "Okay, cool".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But mystery shopping's easy too, so --
L:  Yeah, especially when you get to go to, like [inaudible] and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I did, uh, five Firestones --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- a couple of weeks ago and that check came yesterday, I was, like, "Yes". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I got to go to Walmart and do it and get just, like, glasses.  I got, like, reimbursed, like, a hundred and twenty five dollars so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  That was a good one.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Took 'em forever to send it, but they did, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, but when you get that money, it's like, "Oh, I forgot all about that" yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I was on this one thing, it's, uh, Net Flip --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, like, some of it you have to sign up for stuff and then pay and, you know, that's not worth it, but other things, you just, like, sign up to look at 'em and sign up on trial things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and once you earn, like, twenty dollars in that Flip credit, they'll send you a twenty dollar check.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Net Flip?
L:  What?
R:  Net Flip?
L:  Yeah, Net Flip dot com.
R:  Hm.
L:  I only ever did it once, because then I kind of ran out of things to look at, 'cause a lot of 'em you have to sign up for stuff and it's just, like, ah, you don't wanna --
R:  Make your dough.  All --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- that same information over and over.
L:  Yeah, and junk email after that, 'cause they all want your --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- email address.
R:  Yeah, that's why I set up a hotmail account just for junk.
L:  Yeah, that's what I need to do.  I need to switch mine all around, but then I forget half my passwords. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, the one account I can't even get into anymore.  I don't if it's, like, not available.  It was, like, you could go -- you go to, like, what was it?  Like Nota dot[?] com --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then you could set up, like, different endings, like, yeah, and like just different little things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I tried to go to it, and it was gone, like the whole --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- site didn't exist at all.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I was, like, "That's weird". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was, like, well, any email I have there I don't have to look at.  That'd be the time I'd win, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a million dollars or something, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] I just get --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sick of getting online though, 'cause most of it is junk. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Okay, come on ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It should be about ten minutes.  I'm going to look on my phone and see what it says.  Yeah, I have ten minutes and twenty seconds, so we're approaching ten minutes any time now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Send me my money, that's all I have to say. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I set up me a whole different second account just for this kind of money, play money.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] That's the way to do it, otherwise [LAUGH] you get it mixed in with bill money and then [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm, mhm.  So, today --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I went and got a brand new tattoo, that was set up with my play money. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I wanna get a tattoo, but I wanna get it on the back of my neck, but I'm just afraid it's going to hurt really bad.
R:  Oh, I had mine on my shoulder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- today and it really didn't hurt really -- it hurt, but the guy was talking to me and he was talking all off the wall, something about sex and my mind --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- was just going -- I mean, but it -- it took the mind off the pain.  I was, like, he's good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
