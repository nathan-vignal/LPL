R:  [NOISE] Hi.  My name is Solomon.
L:  Hi.  I'm Janet.
R:  Hi, Janet.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Same here.
R:  [NOISE] You smoke cigarettes?
L:  Not anymore.
R:  When did you smoke? [NOISE]
L:  When?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Ah, up until June of nineteen ninety nine [SIGH] when I had a massive heart attack.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  They gave me up for dead, but here I am.
R:  So, you quit pretty quick?
L:  Well, I was in the hospital and I didn't go through withdrawal or anything --
R:  Ha.
L:  -- because I was out of it for, like, three weeks.  I -- I was gone.
R:  So, when you got out, were -- you didn't even feel like smoking?
L:  No.
R:  Ha.
L:  No.  Unfortunately people around me do.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And they're --
R:  So, how do you feel about banning smoking, considering you used to smoke?
L:  I'm all in favor of it, only because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm a living example of what can happen.
R:  Right. 
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- prior to that I felt it wasn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the government's business.
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  And well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it is their business because it's up to them 
R:  [NOISE]
L:   -- to protect society.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
L:  What is your opinion?
R:  Um, I don't have a real firm opinion because I can see the -- I can see the -- the -- the argument that people should be able to make their mistakes.  People should be able to make bad mistakes.  Um, that kind of, um -- the idea that, you know, the government has -- hasn't a role.  But then, I also hate smoking.  And dad [NOISE] smoked for [NOISE] years and years [NOISE] and, ah, finally quit.  And I've never -- I mean, I've smoked before, but I [NOISE] don't -- [NOISE] I've never [NOISE] really smoked much long -- very long.  And I have being around people that smoke. [NOISE]  Um, I guess I feel like I think it's okay to a certain degree.  Like, I would -- I would -- I would disagree with banning smoking, like, all together like the way that, um, other drugs are -- are banned.  But, I do like it when I go to a -- like, a club or a bar or something like that and smoking is -- is banned, because then I don't have to be there and smoke it, you know.
L:  Well, right.  
R:  And breathe it.
L:  But, like -- like I'm saying though that the government [COUGH] -- really it's none of their business, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- aren't they here -- aren't they -- like -- like, the seatbelt issue for example.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, I don't think it's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they have the right to enforce it.  I think the have the right to recommend it.
R:  Right.
L:  And I personally believe that, um, somebody's getting a kickback from it.
R:  Yep.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  However, with smoking, people say, "Well, I have the right to smoke.  It's my body.  It's, you know --".  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you really don't if you're gonna involve other people.  And other people are involved with the cigarette smoking.
R:  Sure.  It also kicks up insurance prices. [NOISE]
L:  Ah, right.  And we all pay in the long run because of it.
R:  Right. [NOISE]  And I think it's just -- I think there's some sort of balance because I [NOISE] -- I mean, I agree with that, but I also think it -- it wouldn't be right to ban it completely. [NOISE] Um, like to make it illegal at all to smoke cigarettes anywhere. [NOISE]  Um, I think that that would be drastic al- -- too drastic also. [NOISE] 
L:  But, what's the other alternative? 
R:  I think that's somewhere in between.  Like, I -- I think it's good to have a lot of public education against it. [NOISE]  Um, [NOISE] and to ban it in public places, like in -- in [NOISE] maybe some bars and stuff like that. [NOISE]  Um --
L:  And which ones are th- the ones chosen?
R:  [NOISE] I don't --
L:  You know --
R:  -- know.
L:  -- what I'm saying?  That would cause --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- friction with them. 
R:  [NOISE] I'm sorry.  What?  
L:  It would cause friction with them.  They would say, "Well, why are you picking on me?"  And, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Um [NOISE] I don't -- I don't know.  I don't have the answer to that.  But, um, [NOISE] I guess -- I guess I feel like people should have the right to go to a bar that doesn't have smoke in it.  But, people should also have the right to be able to go to a bar to smoke. [NOISE]  Um, and -- and I also think that [NOISE] maybe, ah, it's not even just an element of what the government can do about it, but how [NOISE] -- that it's also cultural, because [NOISE] I mean, even if we ban cigarette smoking all together people are stil gonna smoke cigarettes. [NOISE]  And that's -- I mean, as much as I think the government should have some [NOISE] sort of rule and [NOISE] -- and -- and, um, [NOISE] you know, [MN] in -- in, you know, curbing people's behaviour, um, it's also not always the best way of curbing people's behaviour, 'cause prohibition showed that it wouldn't stop people from drinking and things like that.  Um, I think banning things is always the best way of -- of getting people to not do stupid things. Like, I -- I don't necessarily agree with a lot of legal -- um, a lot of -- like, I don't agree with the -- the, um [NOISE] -- um, making certain drugs illegal that are cert- -- currently illegal 'cause I think it makes the problem worse. [NOISE]   Um, so to me, it has -- to me, it has to become somewhere in between. [NOISE]  And I imagine if smoking was banned all together in this country there would be quite an uproar. [LAUGH]  For good or for bad, whatever, you know. [NOISE] 
L:  I see what you're saying, but by the same token, I'm really surprised that the government is doing this --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because look at the money that they're making --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- by having people smoke.
R:  [NOISE] True.
L:  Taxes and everything else.
R:  [NOISE] And they have the -- the, um, cigarette companies in their back pockets, so --
L:  That's what I'm saying.  Exactly.
R:  Right. [NOISE]  Or, maybe it's the other way.  It's the government has -- is in the back pocket of the cigarette companies. [NOISE]  Yeah, it's pretty surprising. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  It totally shocked me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, I heard that they're did that in California, and I don't know how they've made out.
R:  [NOISE] They did what?
L:  That you couldn't smoke anywhere.
R:  They just did it in New York too. [NOISE] 
L:   Right.  Well, that's not effective yet.  It's going to be effective --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  -- but isn't yet.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I am in New York.
R:  Oh, you are?  Okay.  I'm in --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Philadelphia. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  Um, they --
R:  What --
L:  -- have --
R:  -- has it been like in New York? [NOISE] 
L:  Well, it's not into effect yet.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  It -- they're tr- -- they're -- they're putting it some time in July.
R:  [NOISE] Are people pissed off about it, or not? 
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Some -- some are saying, "Yeah".  You know, you've got people on both sides.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I -- I would have to go to New York to talk to people to really get a good sense of it, but I think -- I mean, I -- certainly I would personally rather live in -- in a place that banned cigarette smoking in public places, 'cause I like -- I like to dance, and I hate leaving and smelling like cigarettes, and f- -- and breathing them the whole time while I'm there.  Um, but it -- but, you know -- yeah, I don't know.  Um, there's also a lot of -- I -- I -- I go to coffee shops and stuff too, and there's always smoking that I have to, like, run from, you know.
L:  Well, the way it's been here in the pa- -- well, up until they passed this -- well, up until this comes into effect, is you can go to certain restaurants, where you're allowed to smoke as long as they have an enclosure --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- you know, for the non smokers.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you can't bring your children into that area --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if they're under eighteen.
R:  Ha.
L:  So, this is where I think it's ridiculous.  I think it's up to the parents to make that decision whether or not their child should be exposed to smoke or not.
R:  Right.
L:  So, let's say I'm a smoker, and I go into a restaurant [LIPSMACK] and I have to cho- -- I have my kids with me and they're under eighteen.  I have to either sit away from my kids, or go to non smoking.  And it takes away choice, which is what our country's based on -- our freedom.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think we're losing a lot of freedom with it.  
R:  I'm actually surprised that you said that, because it seemed like the position you were taking before that was that the government should be -- have a lot of say in whether people --
L:  No --
R:  -- sh- --
L:  -- no -- no -- no.  I said they shouldn't have a say.  I am --
R:  So, they shouldn't have a say?  
L:  Right.
R:  Oh.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  The government should not have a say.  I think it should be up to the individual parents.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, no -- no. I meant about the other -- 'cause you -- you were -- you were in favor of -- of banning smoking in certain sec- -- in certain places, right?
L:  Right.  I'm in favor of banning it, but I don't think the government has -- should have the say.  Do you see what I'm saying?
R:  Well then, who --
L:  I think --
R:  -- who's banning it?
L:  The government.  But, I don't think they should.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it should --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- up to individual restaurants and what have you.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  I don't think the government --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has a right to step in and say, "You can't do this.  You can't do that ... Um, you can't bring your child to this restaurant because there's not a no smoking section available for you -- for them".
R:  Right.
L:  Um, they're -- they've taken away too many rights.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I'm a child of seven kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- none of us are alcoholics or drug addicts or -- um, because I grew up with, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't spare the rod because you'll spoil the child.
R:  Right.
L:  Today's day and age, you know, you tap your kids on the butt and, you know, the child can then turn around and call Child Protection and say they were being abused --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they're taken away from you.  And, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that may not be the case.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I -- that's what I think is wrong with our country today -- 'cause the government it takes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too many stands.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Takes the parental rights away.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Now, they're -- they're gonna take away the parental rights on whether or not you could take your child to a place that has smoking establishments.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] You --
R:  So -- so, you think that -- that -- that -- that there should be no government inter- -- like, government shouldn't have any say on whether people should smoke or not, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- businesses should?
L:  Right.  I'm -- I'm in -- a firm believer on not smoking.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, I don't think it's for the government that should tell us that.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  I --
R:  So, how -- I mean, how -- 'cause I think that's -- I think that -- wh- what do you think would happen if the government did it all?  Do you think most businesses would [NOISE] ban smoking, or not, or what? [NOISE]
L:  What I think is maybe what the government could do -- I'm not saying it's gonna work.  I don't know -- but, if it -- it's even been presented.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But -- but, there -- perhaps the government can give --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for example, restaurants -- special bonuses if they do do this.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  But not to make it --
