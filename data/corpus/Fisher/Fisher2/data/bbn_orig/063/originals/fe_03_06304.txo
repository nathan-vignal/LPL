L:  [NOISE] Good morning.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine, thank you.  My name is Clementine Taylor[?] and I'm from Albourne in New York.
R:  Oh, okay.  My name is Ceecee[?] and I'm in Missouri.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  We're a long ways apart.  [inaudible] --
L:  Yes, we are.
R:  Have we done this before?
L:  No, I haven't.  [several inaudible words]
R:  The Fisher Study[?].  Have you done the Fisher Study before?
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Hello?
L:  Ah, yes.  Can you hear me?
R:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yes, I've done the affirmative action study --
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that was interesting and, um, smoking is even more interesting.
R:  Ah, yes it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- do you smoke?
L:  Yes, I'm a smoker.
R:  Okay.
L:  I smoke about a pack a day.  Do you?
R:  No, I don't --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- never have. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, good, now we can have a conversation. [LAUGH]
R:  You're not kidding.  My -- my ex husband smoked and he quit -- he had an automobile accident in ninety nine, he was my husband for forty years --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and he had an automobile accident in ninety nine and quit because he was on the ventilator --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he quit for two years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The day I filed for a divorce and left him, he started smoking again.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  He's, ah, fifty nine years old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, he's sixty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- same as I am.  And he's on a -- a machine at night to breathe and has to take treatment three times a day.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, um, mm boy, when it comes to smoking ... [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Now, his lungs are clear now, this has been after two years?
R:  Ah, they would have been.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- does he suffer from em- emphysema?
R:  Yes, he does have emphysema.  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, so that's the problem --
R:  He has C.O.P.- --
L:  -- that's hindering him right now.
R:  Right.  He has C.O.P.D. --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Chronic -- ah, Chronic Obstructive --
L:  Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.  Mhm.
R:  -- Pulmonary Disease.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  Well, um, I remember years ago my husband went in to the hospital for a ruptured spleen --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and I recall seeing this big bottle full of black fluid --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and it was smoke that had infiltrated his lungs --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- and I said, "That's -- a -- ooh, is that what I'm taking in?  Is that what I'm taking in?" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- right?  However, that didn't bother me be- -- so much because we were still functional [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and fine, he didn't suffer from anything due --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to the smoke --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because they just cleared that immediately out of his system --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and we both continued smoking.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  However, he's fine, I'm fine.  We don't suffer from respiratory problems --
R:  Neither -- neither one of you?
L:  -- but that did bother me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  No, neither one of us.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I just looked at that -- that did really bother me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for a little while [inaudible] I had considering stopping smoking.
R:  Have -- have you ever tried to quit?
L:  I never wanted to.
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
L:  Never had a desire to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I enjoy smoking and, um, I do actually detest the fact that everyone is trying to stop us from smoking --
R:  I understand.
L:  -- the smokers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have a right --
R:  Yes, you do.
L:  -- they have a right.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  There are more addictives in this world --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- than smoking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and over the years -- and we know our ancestors have lived many, many years --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and the younger people are dying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at an earlier rate, but why I don't know, why I cannot say but it's not all because of smoking.
R:  No, it's not.
L:  And, um, I'd like to know where they do their statistical study --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- because I know that aphrodisiacs smoke like four packs a day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they live long lives and they don't die of cancer.
R:  Right.
L:  So, [LAUGH] --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I happen to think it's the preservatives they put in these farm products --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that have hindered us -- hindered us so greatly.  If smoking were the thing, I would rather they attacked the drugs of abuse --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- drugs that really harm people and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, make them harm others --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a- -- you know, these are things they really need to attack --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the bureaucracy, the aristocrats and all that that are doing a whole lot of garbage --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and hindering others.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I'm hurting my own self, that's self infliction --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, to my body --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'm not -- through my smoking, I'm not hurting the rest of the world.
R:  Okay, what do you think about second hand smoke?  Do you think that can be harmful?
L:  No, I -- I -- well, it can be after long, long --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ah, process of someone smoking in your presence.
R:  But -- now see, that's what I asked my husband --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um and I said, you know, "What are you going to d- -- ah, say if?" -- because I was after him to quit smoking because he ha- -- he was cou- -- he would cough --
L:  Coughed constantly.
R:  -- he coughed until he -- until he -- until he blacked out.
L:  Mm.  Mm. Mm.
R:  And he did that and that's what --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- that's what caused him to be in that accident, if he started coughing and he --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- he lost consciousness --
L:  Uncontrollable.
R:  -- and hit a rock wall and --
L:  Gee whiz.
R:  -- was life [inaudible] --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and actually died in the hospital and they brought him back --
L:  Get out of here.
R:  And -- and I said -- no it's the truth and I said, "Ah, what would you do if I came down with cancer because of your smoking?" and he said, "Well, I guess I just have to live with it".  Well, I've had breast cancer twice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the last three years.  I've had two mastectomy's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, ah, of course I've never smoke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I've never drank --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when I divorced my husband we remain on good terms --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, like I said, we had forty years and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, I'm always going to --
L:  After forty years you divorced?
R:  I sure did.
L:  Damn.
R:  I said, "Out of there.  Out of there".  I w- had been unhappy for at least ten years of that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- really.  He was verbally abusive --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but he's the father of my children --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- my -- and I'm always going to have feelings for him but I --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- the thing I sa- thought was, you know, "I've been through so much" like I said, and I had the cancer and I had the breast removed and then I went on the internet, I dated eighteen guys in eighteen months --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  You go girl, I'm going on the internet now.
R:  Well, I had -- I had a blast.  Now, I [LAUGH] --
L:  Did you go see any of them?
R:  Oh, all of them.
L:  Oh!  Get out of here.  Oh, I got to try it.  All right, we'll talk about that after. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We'll have to call each other back! [LAUGH]
R:  I -- well, they'll -- they'll be getting on us for not talking on the subject [LAUGH] but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but ah I -- the -- the one thing that I knew -- um, once I had gotten out of the house without -- with being away from someone who smoked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my hair no longer -- I -- I can get in an elevator, I can be near someone who smokes and I can smell it.  It --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- you know, because I'm no longer around it. [COUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  And I -- that was one of the things I said when I started dating again is I did not want to be with a smoker --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- because I have had -- okay, and in February -- this -- this past February -- I got married last August again --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um --
L:  Oh, congratulations.
R:  -- oh, I'm -- I love him, he's -- he's the best man in the whole world.
L:  Beautiful.  Beautiful.
R:  I am -- I thank the good Lord --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- for us finding each other and, ah, anyway he doesn't smoke or drink and we just have so much fun together --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that was the -- one of the things I thought is, "I don't want to be with a smoker" and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I came down with breast cancer the second time --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and now I'm going to have my knee replaced in three weeks --
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  -- oh -- oh, I'm just --
L:  You're falling apart.
R:  Yeah, I am and I'm only sixty --
L:  Yeah.  Me too, I'm only fifty five --
R:  -- I don't feel [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- and I have a million things.
R:  Well, I don't even feel that w- -- I don't even feel sixty --
L:  Good.
R:  -- and we just -- we just have so much fun together and here my ex husband is at three hundred and seventy pounds --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- all he does is smoke --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- play dominos, drink Pepsi and get fatter.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  He has no life, you know, and --
L:  It's depression.
R:  -- it is pitiful.  I mean, the man is only sixty years old and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's just sitting there and his whole life is --
L:  Rotting away.
R:  -- rotting away.
L:  Rotting away.
R:  That's a good thing for it, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  And -- and as far as -- as smoking, I feel like it's everyones right, that's their choice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't think that I should have to breathe somebody elses smoke.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's health -- for health reasons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but I don't want to -- ah, and I don't -- I really -- I'm not strong on the fact of the government saying that -- I think there should be smoking areas --
L:  I do too.  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- I think they should be -- you know, you can go into a -- an area and this is for the smoking -- that's fine.
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm -- I'm cont- -- I'm just fine with that.
L:  I'm with that.  Yes, me too.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- because I think -- I don't want to take your rights away --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- but I don't want the smoke blowed in my face either.
L:  That's fine and I could agree with that wholeheartedly really, because I didn't have any problem with going to a smoking area.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  My sister's very religious and my family's very religious --
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  -- and in my faith we know we don't smoke and drink.
R:  Mhm.
L:  However, every time she comes into my apartment, "Ooh, that smoke!  Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!" --
R:  And you --
L:  And I get so sick and tired of that crap.
R:  Right.
L:  I --
R:  She said it one time, that should be enough, you know?
L:  It should be.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, I went out and bought a, um, air purifier --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- trying to remove some of the smoke.  Because she says, "Oh, it gets on my clothes.  It gets on my hair --"
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I go to church and people think that I'm smoking" and --"
R:  [SIGH]
L: -- I -- I apologized but I have tried, you know, when she comes to my home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they're still my sister and do want her here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but her incessant complaining is getting on my damn nerves, I have to --
R:  I under- -- I --
L:  -- put it that way, you know?
R:  I understand.  Yes.
L:  And even if I go out and spend good money and I want a nice dinner and to have fun and enjoy myself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I want to smoke after I finish eating --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I want to have fun and laugh and talk with my friends.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't want to rush out of the restaurant because I want a cigarette --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I want to sit there and socialize.
R:  Right.  I understand.
L:  However, I feel that the bars, the clubs, the, um, after dinner theatres are going to suffer because people cannot enjoy themselves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when they do want to smoke their cigarettes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We are catering to a group which I don't think is fair.  Let us do the half and half again.  Let us please have our section, you have yours.  We will respect one another --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as I've always been respectful of others --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- even before laws, rules, regulations came out.
R:  Right.
L:  If it bothers you I'm [several inaudible words] you.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know, I don't want to but at the same token, don't offend me either.
R:  Right.  I --
L:  You know?
R:  I understand.
L:  And don't make me feel like I'm nothing because --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I am somebody.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Don't make me feel because I smoke that I'm a germ --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- because that I'm not.
R:  I -- great -- so you have no -- no medical problems then from smoking.
L:  I have a thousand medical problems, whatever ones are attributed to smoking I don't know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I do suffer from Multiple Sclerosis.  I have [several inaudible words] --
R:  Well, that probably had nothing -- smoking had nothing to do with that.
L:  Probably not at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I suffer from extreme headaches --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- due to my former strokes and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when you have a stroke you have vessel constriction --
R:  Exactly.  Right.
L:  Okay?  I have peripheral vascular disease --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's my walking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  However, I don't have Bergers disease which is associated with smoking --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- and the content of the smoke
