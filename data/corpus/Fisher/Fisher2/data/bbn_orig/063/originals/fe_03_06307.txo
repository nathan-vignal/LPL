L:  Hi, this is Cecilia.
R:  Hey, this is Matt.
L:  Hi, Matt.  How are you?
R:  Good, how are you doing?
L:  Where are you?
R:  Uh, I'm in Utah.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
L:  We couldn't get much further away.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well --
L:  Um, the subject today is about banning smoking?
R:  Yeah, in public places and then -- what was the other part?
L:  Uh ...
R:  It was, how do we feel about the programs or ...
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I, uh, I'm an ex smoker.  I've been -- I quit a couple of years ago and -- and as much as I rant and rave about people smoking I don't think it's, uh -- it should be banned.  I -- I think that people should be -- have that freedom to smoke or not smoke and kill themselves or not kill themselves.  I mean, we all --
R:  +Mhm.
L:  -- know the -- the -- the perils of smoking.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, but, you know, as long as they keep it, uh, ventilated I don't find it offensive, even though I'm an ex smoker and I'm probably more critical about it than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the average bear.  I don't know if I believe all this, uh, hooey about second hand smoke and -- I mean, we've -- people have been smoking for years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  And all of a sudden it just came up where, uh, you know, smoking in public places is, you know, against the -- goes against the grain.  [MN]  Here in Florida, as of July first, there is no smoking in any public place at all.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  No.
R:  From July first on.
L:  Yep.  No -- no, uh, bars, no restaurants, no --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- anywhere indoors.  And it's really, um -- people here are really up in arms about it.  But, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know that's what they voted for so, I don't know.  I -- I don't believe that it's, uh, [MN] that it's a right thing to do.  I think it's take away people's rights --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to make a choice for themselves.
R:  Yeah, I'd say, um, I probably agree with that part.  That if they -- I guess their whole argument is -- has to do if it's, you know, you're forcing other people to, um, second hand smoke.  But, I mean, if they're doing it in a well ventilated area where it's not affecting any -- anyone else --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then it would seem --
L: And it's -- and it's, um, you know --
R:  Just the whole principle of it is -- would be, like, you can hurt yourself as long as you're not hurting anyone [LAUGH] else.
L:  Well, and that's true.  Because really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you take -- you -- you are taking the rights away from people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when you -- you tell them that they can't do something.  You know, if it -- if whatever it is.  If it's smoking.  If it's voting.  If it's drinking.  If it's, you know, driving, whatever it is.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, you start restricting what people can and can't do and I start -- the hairs start coming up on the back of my neck.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I, uh, and I -- I believe everyone is -- is, uh, offered a free choice in the world and it's just like any of this, you know, pornography kind of stuff.  It's just -- it all goes along the same things.  If you don't like it, then you don't go there.  You don't do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, just because it's out there doesn't mean you have to do it.  Just because you walk into a restaurant and there's a smoking section available doesn't mean you have to go sit over there.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, that's -- that's the way I feel and -- and [MN] I just think once you start taking away people's rights to smoke you're going to start taking away people's rights to do other things as well.
R:  Yeah, it could -- it +could set a precedent.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um --
L:  Yeah, and I just, you know, I -- I think if they -- if they ban it from all public places then, you know, again you know, what's next?  I mean, you can't even smoke in an outdoor arena here in Florida.  Like, if you're at a -- a -- a -- a basketball game or -- or -- not a basket- -- a football game.  Like here in Tampa there's, uh, the Bucks play here and that's an outdoor stadium.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can't smoke in the stadium.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Even though it's outdoors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [MN] again I mean, you're restricting people's rights and -- and as good or as bad as it is, you know, the habit of smoking which is -- we all know is terrible and it kills people but, you know, if somebody wants to kill themselves then that's their decision as long as it doesn't affect me, you know, directly where the smoke's going right in my face.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um ...
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I guess it de- -- I -- seems like it comes down to a question of if it's negatively affecting other people, and like what situations it is, and how harmful it is to other people.  And then, also, I just remember talking about, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] -- I'm taking an economics class --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're talking -- they talk about how the government -- their -- one of their main roles is to, um, protect the, like, the general welfare of everyone.  Like ...
L:  Yeah, but do we really want the government to start regulating the welfare of all of us?
R:  Mm, yeah, and I g- -- like the whole [MN] purpose, I guess, of government is to protect life, liberty and --
L:  The pursuit -- 
R:  -- allow us freedom or allow us to pursue happiness.
L:  Right.
R:  And so --
L:  But I --
R:  I mean I'm not trying to argue or anything but I think maybe that's where they could be coming from.  They're saying, you know, we're trying to protect life, like that's our first call as government, but, um ...
L:  Yeah, but again, then -- then the government's getting involved in our personal lives and, I mean, how much do you want -- you know what happens when the government gets -- gets involved in certain businesses in certain situations that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just muddies the waters, so to speak.  And, uh, it just gets -- turns into just a big mess and, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we've seen it time and time again and for the government to tell me, or anybody else, that you can't smoke in any -- any particular, uh, place or, you know, some states they're -- they're trying to get where you can't even, in certain jobs, that you have you can't even smoke, period.  Even in your own home. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because of the kind of job that you have.  You know, if you're a firefighter or you're a -- a, you know, a particular kind of, um, social worker or something.  They don't even want you -- you can't even smoke, period, even if you're in the privacy of your own home.  And, you know --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- again, how far are they going to go?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they're going to tell me that I can't -- if I decide I want to smoke in my own home watching a movie, that I can't do that because of the kind of job I do?  You know, I mean, that's what I mean when the government starts to get involved and tell people what -- what they can and can't do.  Especially smoking, because it's such a hot topic these days.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and you have the smoker --
R:  Well, yeah, it is a hot topic because of the government, I guess, right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, they're just -- I mean -- and you know with all these lawsuits that have come down [MN] to, uh, you know, sue the tobacco companies because, you know, George Jones, or whoever the guy's name was, that got cancer from smoking cigarettes, you know, thirty five years ago.  Well, you know, I mean [SIGH] ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean that's just commonsense.  If you drink, you know, a bottle of vodka every day, you're probably going to die of liver cancer. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, without the government telling you that.  You [LAUGH] know [MN].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I guess I just -- I'm -- I'm really adamant about the government taking away my rights and other people's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rights no matter if it's smoking or drinking or anything.  And --
R:  And I -- I would say another issue is the whole, um, being consistent if, like, the government thinks -- well, for one thing, if they're going to come down so hard against tobacco companies you'd think that they'd come down hard against, mm, like all the beer commercials and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean when you consider -- when you look at the beer commercials that's -- everybody's happy and there's a bunch a, you know, good looking [MN] women around, like, scruffy guy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then, you know, when the actual reality of it is [MN] sometimes people are happy but, you know, a lot of times it causes really --
L:  Well, I remember --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [MN] the same thing.  I mean way back when, when I was a young girl, I mean, I'm forty seven, I was a young girl and I remember cigarette, um, ads on TV, in magazines, in -- on the radio.  Everywhere.  And then they banned those. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and why don't they ban liquor, like you said, liquor commercials and liquor ads and liquor sponsorships to, you know, NASCAR and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, tennis events and what have you, um, if -- if it's such a [MN] -- you know, horrible thing.  Well, the reason is because they get so [MN] -- these events get so much money as sponsors from these tobacco companies just to have their names on the product or on the racecars or on the sideboards, or whatever it is.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so they're going after the cash.  And [MN] that, you know, that's all out with the, um, this kind of stuff is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The, um, the -- the cigarette companies, you know, don't want to be told what and when and where they can do what they do but, at the same time, public health is a huge issue and a lot of us working people, you know, are supporting a lot of people that are effected by emphysema and other --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- health related illnesses that, you know, we paid for through Medicare, Medicaid --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, through the government and, you know ...  I don't know it --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I also forgot about that part.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, you got to -- you got to look at it from the other side of the fence --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- too.  And -- and because, you know, we're paying the price for some of these people that are long time cigarette smokers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  We're paying for their health care benefits and their whatever as they're dying from
