L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, this is Michele.
R:  Hey, this is Seth.
L:  Who is this?
R:  Seth.
L:  Seth, how are you?
R:  Doing good.
L:  Good, where are you from?
R:  South Carolina.
L:  Oh, I'm from Boston.
R:  Awesome.
L:  Hey, are they still allowing you to smoke in bars there?
R:  Um, I don't think so.
L:  No, we just passed the ban two weeks ago.
R:  Right.
L:  That you can't smoke in, um, any of the bars in Boston anymore.
R:  [NOISE]  Well, I guess that's [NOISE] a pretty good idea.
L:  Do you smoke?
R:  [NOISE]  Huh, no, I don't smoke.
L:  No, and I do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh right.
L:  But I don't -- it's not a bad idea totally, except the fact that you have all these people hanging around the outside of the bars now, smoking when you walk in.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  Do you see that?
R:  Uh, yeah, I would imagine it would be totally people hanging outside.  [NOISE]  I guess it's a pretty good idea [inaudible] like, case [inaudible] smoke on other people, whatever, but it's such like, a huge culture around bars and stuff like that, whatever, it seems like it'd be pretty hard to implement or whatever.  [NOISE]  [MN]
L:  Around bars?
R:  Huh?
L:  Well, is this banned for public --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Does this mean ou- outside too?
R:  [NOISE]  I don't think so, right?  It's just like, in a restaurants and bars isn't it?
L:  I don't know, it said public places.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So I'm won- --
R:  Right.
L:  I'm wondering if they're thinking more of public places that, uh --
R:  What, like parks and stuff like that or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  I don't know.
L:  [MN] I don't know now, but I know they banned it somewhere though, outside, I thought.
R:  It seems like another excuse to give people summonses, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's what I was talking about with the last guy, he's like, "Do you think they ticket the person or the bar owner?" and I thought --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the bar person, but I don't know, maybe they'll start ticketing people?
R:  Yeah, that's what I would assume or whatever.
L:  Well that doesn't sound too cool, I'm not gonna pay a ticket for that.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It shouldn't be legal -- I don't know -- you can't smoke it out in public, doesn't make any sense.
L:  Well, I know, but they do a lot of things that don't make sense.  Did you -- did you ever smoke?
R:  Huh, yeah, I smoked for a little bit.
L:  How did you quit?
R:  Um, [MN] trying to quit like, many different times or whatever, and just basically being like, although I gotta wean myself off of, you know, spending so much money or whatever so I can -- have to work as much at this crappy ass job I was working at or whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So basically, the main motivation --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I agree, it's the kind of -- they're like, five bucks a pack here now.
R:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Like, seven fifty up in New York City or whatever, like -- it's like ridiculous?
L:  Are they like, seven dollars in New York City?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I went there in January and I found myself saying, "Do you have any cheap generic ones?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.  [NOISE]
L:  But I go up to New Hampshire, it's only fifteen minutes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- up the road from here.
R:  Oh right.
L:  So I can get them for, uh, between two fifty and three dollars --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a pack.
R:  Oh wow, that is pretty cheap.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh yeah, you can get them much cheaper.  Or you can go on the Web and get them, but I haven't done that.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I heard so- -- I heard a lotta people are ordering from the website or something like that, somewhere around New York City or whatever.
L:  Yeah, that's what --
R:  'Cause [inaudible] people like, shouting out like, prices of the cigarettes and stuff, you're just walking down the street.
L:  Oh, it's absurd.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  Well you're right, you could try selling them [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, yeah, you just go down and [several inaudible words] I wouldn't buy a bonus.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, they're like two dollars [several inaudible words].
L:  Wow.
R:  Yo.  [NOISE]
L:  Why don't you -- where are you from again, South Carolina?
R:  Yeah, yeah, like, round the upstate area, whatever.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you have good weather?
R:  Do what?
L:  No, you're not g- having good weather --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- either now, are you?
R:  Yeah, I -- I had to call Ma, she said it was like, pretty rainy down there and stuff like that.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, and it's getting kinda rainy here, and cold --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- way too cold.
R:  Yeah, yeah, right.  Yeah, it was like -- it was like as hot as hell yesterday, I was walking around in my shorts and stuff [NOISE] like ...
L:  Well, yesterday it got to be in the seventy five --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I think today feels like fifty again!  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, right.  Yeah, definitely, it's pretty chilly outside.  [NOISE]
L:  And cold and rainy.
R:  Yo.
L:  So, are you being blasted?  They guy in California said that they were doing um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tons of, uh, anti smoking campaigns out there.
R:  Oh right.
L:  But I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I haven't seen that many out here.
R:  Yeah, I haven't really either.
L:  But then again --
R:  Like, uh, maybe a few months ago, like, I saw like, a advertisement or whatever like -- the most bit of advertising, but that was like, some anti smoking advertisement that was paid for by like, Phillip and Morris or something like that or whatever, and ...
L:  Oh, the ones they have to do?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I remember seeing 'em a long, long time ago where they were like, piling up body bags outside of like, some building or something.
L:  Oh God!  [SIGH]
R:  It was pretty creepy or whatever.
L:  That is kinda creepy.
R:  [NOISE]  But ... [NOISE]  I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, maybe they should -- or they can just try taking the additives out of the cigarettes.
R:  Yeah, yeah, right, I know, there's like thousands of chemicals.  That's mainly like the wor- -- the worse thing about it or whatever, you know?
L:  Well that's the part that addicts you.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  You know?  And then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, supposedly -- well, in England you can cigarettes, and I think in Canada, that don't have any additives.  Supposedly there's one brand here.  It's not gonna do people who have been smoking for years any good at this point.
R:  Yeah, yeah, right.
L:  But maybe for other people that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- start smoking.
R:  Right.  American Spirit, right?  [NOISE]
L:  Is that what they are?
R:  I think it -- isn't it American Spirit that -- isn't that like, the only brand that doesn't have like, tons of additives in it?
L:  Oh, I'm gonna have to check that, because m- maybe I should try that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, uh, like -- and that's pretty expensive too, whether I think it's like [NOISE], it's pretty expensive and stuff, so --
L:  But I thought that patches were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- expensive too, 'til cigarettes went up.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, right.
L:  You know, to buy the patches they're, I don't know, thirty --
R:  You don't get like, nicotine gum or anything like that, or whatever?
L:  No, I don't like the gum, I tried the gum before.
R:  Right.
L:  And when -- and last time I quit smoking it was using the patches.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I only quit for six months.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  But I -- I think I'd rather do it cold turkey 'cause otherwise you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're still spending money --
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  -- trying to quit smoking.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And you're still getting the nicotine in your system.
R:  Right.
L:  When you're doing that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So I don't know.  I mean, I don't know about this public ban, now I'm gonna kinda want to run a check --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause I swear I thought it was more in the -- in, uh, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the open places they were gonna --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like on sidewalks and stuff.
R:  [NOISE]  Well, I don't [inaudible] area [several inaudible words] bucks or something, I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, if you're in maybe the big cities, I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, yeah, I think it's -- I think it's like, strictly restaurants and stuff.  [NOISE]
L:  I don't go into the cities too much.  Well, even in the small bars near me, most of them either banned smoking or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can't smoke 'til like, after eight o'clock or something foolish like --
R:  Oh really?
L:  Really weird things!  [LAUGH]
R:  That's pretty weird.  I guess they figure like, family people, like [NOISE] -- [inaudible] family people out like, I don't understand that at all.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, the ki- -- if kids are in there or something.
R:  Yeah, what a thing with kids in a bar anyway, but --
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  I just --
L:  Just don't take 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got a feeling like, maybe in a restaurant whatever, like, you know, I can't imagine like, a family going out like, that late at night or whatever to eat or something, but [NOISE] --
L:  Well, you know, none of the restaurants let you smoke anymore at all.
R:  Yeah, I mean, they used to have like, you know, the s- smoking, non smoking section or whatever, but [NOISE] --
L:  Can you smoke in restaurants down there?
R:  [NOISE] Huh?
L:  Is there smoking sections in restaurants down there?
R:  In South Carolina?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think so.
L:  See, I don't --
R:  I haven't been down there in the past like, year and a half or whatever, when I down there, where there was.
L:  Yeah, I don't think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can even smoke in restaurants around here even more.
R:  If I go to -- if I got a restaurant, but, you know, to be asked whether I wanna be a smoker or non smoker, you know?  Like --
L:  I don't think they even ask anymore, I don't think they're allowed to.  Ha- --
R:  I don't know, maybe [NOISE] -- I don't know, I think the thing in New York is pretty like, recent, too, so might -- they have [several inaudible words] allowed to, I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  Mm.  Ruining all of the fun for all of us.
R:  Right.  I gue- -- [MN] -- yeah, I could see 'em [inaudible] in like, larger cities and stuff like that, before they, you know, go in like, smaller towns and stuff, but ...  [NOISE]
L:  I think I'm gonna check the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- American Spirit thing, that might -- and see if those are the ones without the additives.
R:  Yeah, yeah, American Spirit, whatever, were like, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think -- I think it -- y- -- it's pretty much [inaudible] you find it's just about anyway, or whatever.  I know you found like, head[?] shops and stuff like that or whatever.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's really easy to find stuff.
L:  I'll go on the Web.  We'll see if the American Cancer Society --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- recommends any type of cigarettes to smoke!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, right.  [LAUGH]  Right. [NOISE]
L:  Don't think they will, but we'll try!  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, well, what it is the thing, it's like some Indian like, cigarette called, uh, Bennys[?] or something?  [NOISE]
L:  A what?
R:  You heard of those things, they're called like, Bennys or something, like some flavor like [NOISE]  -- they're not -- it's not cigarettes, it's some -- a type of plant or whatever.
L:  Oh, the clothes?
R:  No, I've heard of cloves --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but the cloves are like, that's like, almost like, totally different or whatever, like ...  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's when you were eleven and twelve.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] closing [inaudible] --
R:  I mean, and maybe f- -- I can't -- I can't stand the smell of it, 'cause I got sick of 'em on one time or whatever.
L:  Oh, that would get bad.
R:  I mean, I could understand like, picking 'em up maybe if -- if -- if you just wanna like, cut like, the [NOISE] actual habit of like, lighting up something, so you actually have something in your hands and it's like, smoking or something like that, or whatever.  Obviously -- obviously if you've been smoking for like, a really long time or whatever, it's not gonna kill like, any urge that you like, acquire through smoking and you're like, cigarettes have tons of chemicals and stuff but --
L:  Right.  That's gonna have to take -- and you know how long that takes to get out of your body, people have urges for years.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so that's why, you know, the nicotine patch or, you know, the gum or whatever, come in, but --
L:  But there's -- they're smoking something else now?
R:  Yeah, it's called Bennys or something like that or whatever [NOISE], it's really skinny like a different color, like cigaretty thingies where are they from?  India or whatever.  Like, I saw this article in the paper about -- I've met a couple of kids that are smoking 'em, but I haven't really talked to them long about --
L:  Does it get you high or are they like cigarettes?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know, like ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, it's like some -- I don't know, it's like some type of herb or something like that or whatever, I don't know.
L:  Huh.
R:  That's probably supposed to be similar to cigarettes or whatever, but ...
L:  But not bad for you?
R:  Yeah.  A herb is like -- it's not that much better for you than cigarettes though.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well that's not gonna help then.
R:  [NOISE]  'Cause I don't think anything you -- like, the best thing is that like, you smoke, whether to like, inhale the smoke or [NOISE] whatever, is not good for you anyway, or whatever, like --
L:  Well, yeah, anything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that you inhale into your lungs probably isn't a good thing!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, that -- I would imagine so, for real.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Don't see too many people hanging out with the fires -- around the fire pit inhaling smoke, you know.
L:  Well that's true, the same thing.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's basically the same thing, so that's a lot -- obviously a lot harsher on your lung, you keep on breathing in.  But --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's the same principle or whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, a campfire doesn't quite smell as bad as a cigarette, I guess.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Unless you're really close to it.  I work for a clothing store --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and when they return the sleeping bags, they really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a very strong smelling of camp -- campfires.
R:  Oh, really?  Oh, ya, ya like, rent out sleeping bags and stuff, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I work for REI and we rent out --
R:  Oh okay, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, tents and sleeping bags and stuff.  But it's funny when they start, you know, the season starts, they start returning them, they do this, it's such a strong smell.
R:  Uh-huh.  It smells good, I love it.
L:  Yeah, but a little too much at times.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, right.
L:  It's okay when you're out in the woods.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, right.
L:  Not when you're running round working.
R:  Yo.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But it's, uh, kinda brings ya, I don't know, it's not like [inaudible] the stale smell of like, some like, department store or whatever, but ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or it's like when you -- if, like, you go round a barbecue or something like that, you're barbecuing like, I don't know, potatoes, meat or whatever, like, that smell sticks to you and stuff like that too.
L:  Oh yeah.  I just cooked some --
R:  [inaudible] flavor or whatever, like --
L:  I just cooked ribs and that smells out my whole house right now.
R:  Oh, I love it
