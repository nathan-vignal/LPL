R: [PAUSE] I think I might a heard the tone.  I'm, uh, Dora, from Nebraska.
L:  Hi, my name is Annette Ryder[?].  I'm -- I'm from Seattle.
R:  Oh, hi, good to hear your voice. [LAUGH] It's about smoking today, huh?
L:  Yeah, I -- I understand this thing.  Um, the idea -- I think we're supposed to be talking about the idea of -- of how we feel about -- about the -- the banning of smoking?
R:  Yes.  I think I understood that right.
L:  That's what I'm -- I'm hearing too.  Um --
R:  Okay.  What do you feel about not smoking in restaurants or --
L:  Well, I am actually -- I'm -- I'm actually for it.  I appreciate the -- a smoke free environment because I -- well, again, I have allergies, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm a d- -- I'm a physician's daughter and I know -- he did not smoke.  I did, very briefly, when I was a teenager --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- or not a teenager, but, uh, in college.
R:  A young adult, yeah.
L:  Um, and I don't, [SIGH] uh, I don't like the habit, I don't necessarily like what it does.  I'm not sure that it should be legalistically, um, you know, that you've got to go legalistically enforce it, you know, you've got to fine people or do things, but I think it is a better habit, it -- it's a -- it's a better health habit to be smoke free than to be addicted, and it is, it is addictive, it is -- it is an --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- expensive habit, and it does affect health.
R:  Yes, it's a terribly expensive habit than -- in the workplace, I'm so thankful that we kind of just don't -- all but, uh, ban it in, uh, employment.  I remember in a younger age, I'd go into our coffee break room and, my goodness, and I didn't realize it at the time, but you'd walk out and I must have smelled like a smoke stack, [MN] you know, all of  us --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- walking around. [LAUGH] You know, the odor and so on, and it couldn't have been doing our health any good, sitting in a --
L:  I recall --
R:  Yes?
L:  Go ahead.  I recall the same thing and it -- it's, um, I didn't like the smell of the smoke afterwards --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I didn't realize at the time either, but --
R:  Huh-uh.
L:  -- but the --
R:  Is gals --
L:  -- second -- it's the second -- it's the secondhand smoke effect.
R:  Yes, us gals were always hanging our clothes out to air out, you know, or if you'd go out for an evening, you know, you'd come home [LAUGH] and here we are --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- hanging our things out on the little porch trying [LAUGH] to get things smelling better and I don't think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we just -- actually did not realize [LAUGH] how harmful it was.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  And now, some of these same people are passing away with cancer and it could have been from --
L:  What?
R:  -- that smoke that we had inhaled back then.  Um --
L:  Well, that's the -- that's the thing that -- that --
R:  It's scary.
L:  -- that bo- -- that bothers -- it's -- it's scary, it is scary.
R:  Yeah, it's scary, really.
L:  Because you don't see the aftereff- --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's like a lot of things, you don't see the aftereffects until later.
R:  Yes.
L:  And what --
R:  So, I'm glad --
L:  -- I think concerns me is, I mean, I've got -- I've got kids.
R:  Yes, I do too.
L:  And I wanna be around for 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I'm in my, you know, I'm in my late forties and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I -- I wanna be -- I wanna be around for 'em.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my son, uh, w- well, one of my -- my number one son, uh, wound up being exposed to -- to cigarettes very, very early, I think basically because he took it on a dare from, "You know what?  I'm not going to be your friend if you don't -- if you don't -- if -- if you don't smoke".
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  So, he came home and he was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just -- he was only five.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And he said, "Yeah, well, he wasn't going to be my friend anymore".  I said, I told him, "Rich --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- this guy isn't your friend if he makes you do something --"
R:  Yeah, you sh- --
L:  "-- that you don't wanna do".
R:  You don't need an enemy. [LAUGH]
L:  And he, to this day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he is fifteen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he cannot abide a cigarette.
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  You know, he just -- he is so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anti smoking it's incredible --
R:  Isn't that great?
L:  -- and now he's --
R:  That's wonderful, really.
L:  He -- he doesn't carry it --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- to the -- to the nth degree.
R:  Sure, but he still --
L:  I'm -- I -- I still see it as -- it's -- it's basically in moderation, I -- I appreciate the fact that we have, you know, up in Washington, all our -- all our -- all the bars and restaurants now are smoke free.
R:  Yes, yes, I --
L:  And -- or --
R:  -- like that too.
L:  -- well, no, they do have smoking sections, but they're real limited, but I --
R:  Sections.
L:  -- think at some point --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there are -- there are restaurants that are -- are entirely smoke free.
R:  Yes.  And I think people that do smoke really are wonderful about adhering to this too.  In the most part, I feel people do -- like, people come to my home that smoke, well, they do not smoke in my home.
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  And I sure do appreciate that and they're still my --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- friends, you know, and it's great that they --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Um --
R:  "-- "Oh, Dora doesn't like smokers, we'd better just sit out here on this -- go for a little walk around the block and come back and --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, for floor time, you know, and it's just fine.  I -- I appreciate it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you have to have your smoke.
L:  But I -- I think an awful lot -- I think an awful lot of people who do s- -- who do smoke don't necessarily do it for enjoyment's sake.
R:  This is it, they do it because of, uh, the habit.  It's formed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they can't get rid of it.  Their bodies, they can't -- I'm so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- thankful, I tried smoking and I did not care for it and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I am a very addictive [LAUGH] type person --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I love food, and so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can see why I'd be a king size smoker, just for sure, and in my young age, I grew up with a dad that smoked darn near two or three packs a day --
L:  Oof.
R:  -- and so I feel very fortunate that so far I have passed -- [MN] my mother died of cancer at fifty one, so it's --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- definitely -- you know, definitely in our family, but --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, I'm very thankful that so far, so good. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.
R:  But we sure could of, you know, all of my siblings are so far cancer free and we're --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- all in our fifties, so I'd say we've -- you know, we've at least seen our kids and --
L:  You've done well.
R:  -- and they're seeing our --
L:  You've done well.
R:  -- you know, and still seen our grandchildren, where my mother didn't get to even see her grandkids so --
L:  [inaudible] That's hard.
R:  -- I feel very fortunate.  Yeah, you know, I feel lucky when I think back on that.
L:  But that's -- that's -- I think that's one way that if -- if there's -- I -- I -- you know, I almost think that the -- with the -- the ban, the idea of -- of banning smoking, you know, we -- none of us l- -- none of us like to regulated, but it might be something even that will cause, uh, someone to think about --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- their lifestyle, 'cause we don't wind up thinking about it, we just kind of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kind of follow the habits and do 'em.
R:  That's right.  That's very right.
L:  And I've --
R:  And, um --
L:  -- got a -- well, I've got a daughter and a -- and a husband who are really resistant to changing, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- "I don't know what I'm doing".  Well, maybe it's time to think about it.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Maybe it's time to change --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the way you are.
R:  Right, no, that's true.
L:  Um, I don't like to change my habits either, but on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the other hand, if someone tells me, "You will not --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, "Why? --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- will I not?"  Because, or just because -- not -- well, not just because I said so.  But --
R:  Right, because you want to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that's --
L:  Because this is a problem, because this is a bad habit, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, because.
R:  It's a kind of a dirty habit.
L:  Because this is the law.
R:  Mm, yes, right there.
L:  And I -- I don't -- I don't like that kind of motivation either, but on --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the other ha- -- like, part of me doesn't, but on the other hand, I will obey if I have to, because I don't want the punishment, for one thing.
R:  Well, that's it, yeah.  We -- we obey the seats -- you know, our seatbelt l- law --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, the smoking is, you know, right there beside it, it's -- it is kind of important not to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if people don't appreciate it, then I guess we'll just have to go the next area and sit and smoke. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think that's it.  And because --
R:  And not hurt -- and if we wanna hurt ourself, that's going to be our problem down the road.  My son does --
L:  It is --
R:  -- chew --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- and I say, "Boy, when -- when we start cutting out your gums, honey, I  just don't know if I'm going to come and hold your hand or not" --
L:  Oh, I know --
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  -- I don't like that idea.
R:  Yeah, you know?
L:  Um, and that's --
R:  I really don't.
L:  -- that's the other part of it, is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, we don't -- we don't wanna be regulated because we have our rights and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and we don't wanna be victimized.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  To some degree I understand that, but this is -- it -- it -- yeah, we kind of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- stop being responsible after a while.
R:  Yes, and, like --
L:  And --
R:  -- like you s- --
L:  -- maybe that needs to be --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- under- -- it needs to be understood also.
R:  Yes, and it -- and we have gotten a quite expensive habit and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, not everyone certainly can afford to smoke, really, and if we could even --
L:  Oh, not --
R:  -- present that to ourselves, I guess, to say, "Hey --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- this budget just doesn't include smoking" [LAUGH] you know?  And, uh --
L:  I remember what it used to be back in college, it was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it was a dollar --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was a dollar a pack.
R:  Yeah, see, it wasn't, even when I was thinking of, you can think ten years, even back that, it wasn't that much.
L:  True.  Yeah.
R:  But I remember when my Mom would have to go to the store and buy cigarettes for Dad and, oh, she --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- would just -- you know, "We can't afford this".
L:  And -- but --
R:  And, uh --
L:  -- it still happened anyway.
R:  Yes, it certainly did.  It did.
L:  So --
R:  And so, uh, like a --
L:  -- the idea of --
R:  -- it's a vice, you know, we just can't throw it away, we can't, you know?
L:  Um, and w- --
R:  I'm fortunate that we didn't get caught up in it.
L:  That's good.
R:  And, uh --
L:  That's really good.
R:  -- I think it doesn't hurt to have the signs on the cigarette cartons that this isn't --
L:  I know.
R:  -- good for our health.  That's great and --
L:  Well, absolutely.
R:  And, um --
L:  Um, you know, I've re- -- I -- and the thing that cracks my family up, I don't know if you've -- if you've seen them, if -- you -- you've got the -- probably got the national campaign out there too.
R:  Yes.
L:  Where the -- the woman winds up veering off the road and she nearly slams into --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- a tree.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  "What are you doing?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "You're endangering my life --"
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  "--  I'm just returning a favor". [LAUGH]
R:  That's right, there you go, there -- that's -- yeah, that's a good one. [LAUGH] I like that one. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's funny --
R:  Oh, that's a good --
L:  -- and I guess, for a non smoker, it's a -- a non smoking family, it's even funnier. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, that's just it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's just right, that's right.  No, my daughters, they just can't stand it if they're -- you know, uh, we have a little dairyette here in town, and the guy that runs it smokes and it's c- --
L:  M- --
