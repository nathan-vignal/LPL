R:  H- h- h- hi.  This is Jason.
L:  Hi.  This is Nancy.
R:  Um, h- h- h- hi Nancy.  Ah, w- w- w- where do you live?
L:  Um, I live in New York.
R:  Okay.  Um, I lived in Virginia, ah, ah, near the DC area.
L:  Oh.  That's a nice area.
R:  Yeah.  Um, [MN] um, I think th- the topic was, um, h- h- h- how do -- um, h- h- h- how would we react in -- in a terrorist attack.
L:  Yes.  That's right.
R:  Okay.  Um, [LAUGH] d- do they -- y- y- y- you want to go first?
L:  Sure.  Um, they also asked I think how most people will react and I think most people would probably be pretty panicked.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I think I would -- I wouldn't be calm but I would -- I don't think I'd be like screaming my head off or anything -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] --  
L:  -- like that.  I would probably be, um, trying to figure out what to do or -- or how to help other people or, you know, you could get -- if there was any help available.  I don't have a cell phone but maybe -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I could find somebody who did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Something like that.
R:  Yeah, ah, I- I- I- I would like to think that I would help other people but I'm not sure if I would -- if -- if it was at -- if I was -- if I was actually in the moment, if I would actually do that.  Y- y- y- you know, like, it's, um, I- I- I- I could [inaudible] myself end up either panicking or just trying to r- r- r- run to my family without really -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- even thinking about w- w- w- what I was doing.
L:  That's a good point because I had -- until you said that I wasn't thinking about the fact that one of my kids could be with me or something like that, in which case it would change everything.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or if I was maybe like at home and saw that something had happened at the place where my kids were, that would definitely change everything and I don't know if I would be very -- I'd probably be panicking if something happened to one of my kids.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] Um, yeah, I -- I can see some people kind of reacting in a state of disbelief.  Um, like th- th- th- there's this hidden camera show, um, Comedy Central, a- a- a- ah, Comedy Central, where like -- like the -- like it's a [MN] -- the people on the show may dress up as squirrels and they get taxed like, um, an -- a- a- a- an actor for the show and the people around -- like, watching it, like they've f- f- f- -- they just, like, turn their heads and look kind of weird.  But, they don't r- r- r- really do anything or th- th- th- they don't have as big of a reaction as you would think.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause it's kind of like so strange [NOISE] and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- a- a- a- and I'm just thinking -- like thinking like -- I -- I -- I could see some people going into shock if there was a terrorist at- at- -- a terrorist attack.
L:  I think so too because I remember when nine, one, one, happened -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and someone said to turn on the television and I just watched it and, you know, they just replayed it over and over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It took a long time for me to realise that this was [LAUGH] -- you know, we see so many movies and so many different things that sometimes when something real happens it just seems like a movie.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It takes a while to sink in that this is -- this really happened.
R:  Yeah.  I, um, I -- I h- h- h- -- I had like a similar experience, 'cause just watching it like -- just, like, is this -- is this really happening type thing?  Like, knowing it was happening but, at the same time, it -- it -- it -- it -- it was kind of so shocking.
L:  Right.  It -- it was -- um, I think that it's gone so long since we've had -- since nine eleven, that I think a lot of people have gotten -- never -- I don't think that anybody will ever get back to where they were before nine eleven.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think they've gone back towards that way where they think, "Well, it's been so long.  It probably is not going to happen" and yet when the terrorist things last week happened I think it maybe stirred up some of those feelings again.
R:  Mm.  [NOISE] Like, d- d- d- do y- y- y- you think you were kind of more affe- affe- affected [several inaudible words] attack that you're [inaudible] and some people, um, than like other people around the country? 
L:  Do I think that I'm what?
R:  Ah, do you think that you were more affected by the attack, um -- 
L:  Well, yes and no 'cause I don't really live -- I don't live in New York city.  I live closer to Albany.
R:  Okay.
L:  And but, you know, I had a friend who was -- I knew lived in Brooklyn and my first thought when I saw it was, "Oh" is, "I wonder if he's okay".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which he was.  He wasn't even close to that area, thank goodness.  But, yet knowing that so many people knew so many people and it -- it was like a chain reaction.  It was like everybody know -- seemed to know somebody who was there.
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] H- have you, um, h- h- h- have you done an- any other phone calls for th- the study?
L:  No.  This is my first one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I'm thinking, " [several inaudible words]".  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I- I- I- -- we're supposed to recall if, um, I've -- I've really enjoyed all three calls.  I was kind of surprised that it was kind of so much fun just to kind of chat all with a stranger.
L:  Right.  Yeah, it is.  Because my sister had done them and she said -- so, that's how I found out about them and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she had enjoyed all of hers too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just remembered that you said you lived near Washington DC -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not too far.  Were you -- are you very far from the Pentagon?
R:  Um, I -- I -- I live pretty close to it, like, um, maybe, ah, about ten minutes away.  Um, I- I- I- kind of like after the attacks there's, like -- like, ah, like th- there's so much rubbernecking by the stretch of the highway that kind of went right by the Pentagon 'cause like everyone wanted to know what it -- wanted to see or wanted to see it for themselves.  Um, but I -- I -- I don't -- I wasn't really, um, like I -- I don't, like, I- I- I- I don't feel in danger, really, living near DC.
L:  Well, I don't know if this is exactly on the topic they gave us but I think it's pretty close.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you think that all the stuff that they've done, like with homeland security and all that stuff, does it make you feel safer or do you think that it's just some, like, busy word to make everybody think that they're safer?
R:  Um, I -- I -- I don't -- I don't, ah, I know -- I- I- I- I think -- I think a lot of it, ah, d- d- d- doesn't do a lot of good and I -- I'm a -- [MN] -- I'm like personally kind of worried about stuff like the +Patriot[?] Act, the -- the -- the -- the Patriot Act 'cause it restricts a lot of freedoms.  But, I- I- I- I think some of the heightened s- s- s- security is good.  I mean, like, th- th- th- they do, um, like I guess, a- a- a- ah, the laws that government[?] buildings -- I've noticed that it's like I- I- I- I can't imagine a -- a terrorist getting in there because the security's so tight right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  W- w- w- what are your thoughts on that?
L:  Well, I -- I think -- something like you said, I think some -- in some ways I think that it's working and in other ways I think that if a terrorist really wanted to do something they'd find a way to get around it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess my perspective is sort of -- um, I just flew twice in the last, um, eight days so because of that I -- I -- I guess I think about the airports and I think what they do is good but I -- I'm not just really sure that -- that if they really wanted to that they wouldn't do something to get around it.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I kind of have the same sense that -- I mean, like I -- I g- -- I guess [NOISE] we have to do something and like it -- it probably does do some g- -- it probably does do some good but y- y- y- you can't, like, protect everything where, I mean, I think even if you could have, like, almost near total security, the cost of having that security -- ah, like if they were -- it's -- it's like a -- like an extremely long wait or like they're having less liberties or something.  It's not even worth it.
L:  Yes.  Because, like, when you go to an airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and used to see all this stuff and there's people milling, you know, around and stuff, it just -- I just keep thinking about how different things was before nine eleven and how things will never be the same again and if they tightened security even farther, I don't even know -- it would be almost like why do we even bother trying to live, because you can't -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can't live if it's -- if you can't do anything.  Which right now we can, of course, but I don't know -- it was not too difficult to go on an airplane but I don't know if I want to go to, like, say, um, a -- a ballgame or something like, you know, where there's thousands -- an arena where there's thousand and thousands of people.
R:  Mm.
L:  Now -- well, I think we're in danger right now but, I mean, you just never know when they're going to decide [LAUGH] try again.
R:  Yeah, and -- and like there's enough -- there's, like, enough targets around and [LAUGH] that, um, and then you -- you -- you can't even d- defend them all really.  Ah, I don't know, it's like, um -- like -- like I said it's a s- s- s- scary period of time, ah, that we're living in.
L:  Right.  I -- I -- I still wonder about the kids because -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my kids are -- my youngest is fourteen but I wonder about the kids that -- you know, like, are in grade school and stuff that if they're really scared 'cause I --
