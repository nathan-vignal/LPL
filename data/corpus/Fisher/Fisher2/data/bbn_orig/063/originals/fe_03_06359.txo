L:  Diane.
R:  Uh, Joan.  Uh, do you wanna start or --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Um, well, what -- do -- do you smoke?
L:  No, I'm not a -- I -- I used to smoke, I quit five years ago.
R:  Okay, yeah, I'm not a smoker at all.
L:  Okay, never have been?
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  Um, my children do, uh, well, I have five children, four of 'em do, one doesn't.
L:  Isn't that interesting?  I have four children, and none of my children smoke, and none of their spouses smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That kind of disproves the theory, a- and I've often said this, that people who smoke, they say that your children will smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think just the opposite is true.
R:  I think so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Because my children, I say t- -- I've said to them, "Why don't you smoke?" and they'll say, "Because we couldn't stand the smell when you and -- and their father were smoking".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, I -- I -- I really think, you know, that that's one approach to quitting smoking that they need to forget about. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause I really don't think it works. [MN]
R:  W- well, what do you think about banning, uh --
L:  Well, I think -- I think they've gone a little too far.  I, um, I d- -- personally don't care for the smell of smoke anymore, I -- I -- I -- really, it bothers me, but I do feel that we're infringing on smokers' rights as much they were s- -- infringing on our rights before, so I -- I really think we could be a little bit more reasonable about this.  I mean, i- -- we don't need to make everything non smoking and get a l- --
R:  I agree, I agree.
L:  -- so ridiculous about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How do you feel?
R:  I -- that's the way I feel.  I think we -- we're going overboard on it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, uh, there should be a place for smokers if they wanna do that, that's their business.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and, uh, banning them from every place just, uh, I don't know.  I don't think it makes sense, you know, to do that.
L:  Uh, no, I don't think so either, because -- because people are going to smoke.  It's a -- it's a -- it's an addiction, and they have to do it.  I know that, [LAUGH] so if -- if we don't provide a place for them, they're going to do it places that they're not supposed to, and that's gonna make things uncomfortable for them and us too, so --
R:  And us, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- so, uh, it's not going to help people quit.  You can't force people to quit.  I know that for a fact.  You have to, um, you have to want to quit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and until -- I do think, um, education certainly is a good idea.  I -- I -- I'm not exactly in favor of the education that we have on -- on TV, it really doesn't seem to be real -- real effective, but, um, I sort of think we need more education as to the -- the dangers of smoking and -- and -- or just one very, very minor thing that nobody's really picked up on very much is [MN] smoking makes you stink.
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Sure.
L:  And I had a friend tell me that when I was smoking and I was just very, very upset about that, 'cause --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I considered myself a very clean person, and I like to wear expensive perfume. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That just takes away from it, doesn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And she said, "Well, you'll just -- you won't stink anymore" and I thought, "Well, how could she say I stink?" and this is my very best friend, you know?  But it's the truth and we need to tell people that, "You stink" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  I mean, I don't mean e- every single one of us, but that's something they could incorporate in their ads.
R:  You know the one, uh, you know, um, my son lives with me and he smokes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, and you can smell all over -- like, the, uh, through the house, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- whenever they're smoking.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, yeah, I mean, and when -- if you're outside and you're walking, you know immediately that somebody's been smoking in the house, you know?  It's -- it's -- it's --
L:  That -- that's very true and it's -- it's, like, w- -- even when I go on vacations and things, I always ask now for a non smoking room, because even if it's been a -- a -- a couple of weeks or something, you can smell --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that smell lingers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the room.
R:  And it clings to everything, you know?
L:  It does.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  It -- it really -- it smells your clothes up and it -- it -- you know, leaves kind of a haze in [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it just makes me wonder why I smoked so many years. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't -- I don't pay too much attention, because I don't smoke, so I don't pay much attention to the ads on TV.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, you know, against their smoking or -- or for smoking --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I haven't noticed.  Is there really -- is there a lot of ads on there for, uh, uh, for smoking, or for cigarettes?
L:  Well, actually, there's no -- no --
R:  There's no ads?
L:  -- ads.  Uh, no, they took those off quite a few years ago --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- those were -- those were banned.
R:  I don't really even pay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- any attention to [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] The --
R:  -- to the advertisements really.
L:  I think a person that has never smoked, like yourself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and -- and I have friends that are -- are like that, and they'll say, "Well, you know, it doesn't really bother me" and -- and really, I don't think you're as bothered by it as a person who has smoked and quit.
R:  Oh, I -- I think you're right.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because my mother did that, um, and it bothered her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, I -- I -- it really doesn't bother me, you know, I can -- it bothers my husband, he doesn't smoke and he doesn't like being around smokers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, I've always been around smokers and it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just, uh, you know, it just doesn't bother me that much, unless I would be in a -- I used to go to Bingo, and that was one place where it did bother me, because there were so many people smoking that it just -- my eyes and things would just burn from it, so I just stopped going --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because of it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That -- well, it's like -- it's like going into a bar, I mean, I was with a friend a while back and she said, "Oh, let's --" let's go over to that bar and have some lunch".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I said, you know, "I really just can't stand to go in there, it's smells so bad".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And she just laughed at me because -- and she said, "I can't believe you're saying that" you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I used to smoke and I really l- -- smoked a lot, and I loved smoking and now I can't -- I can't --
R:  Can't --
L:  -- stand to be around it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, so I really, um, I -- I try not to be one of those ex smokers that preaches to people and -- and does m- -- and that's why I don't feel that we should have such, you know, tough laws --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, it -- it's -- it's not a crime.  It's -- it is still legal, and -- and people have a right to make up their minds as to whether they do it.  I -- yeah, it's not healthy, and I --
R:  I --
L:  -- and I -- I'm a -- I'm a nurse --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm in the health care profession and I -- I, uh, but I still think it's something -- a person has to make that decision for themselves.
R:  Yeah, I think too the government subsidizes the farmers --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- the tobacco farmers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, so, you know, uh, why all the, uh, I mean, I understand, like other people, they don't want that secondhand smoke and -- and things like that, but I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- our government is subsidizing it and -- but they're still punishing the smoker, or trying to punish the smoker --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- by not allowing them, you know, to smoke where they want.
L:  That's very true.
R:  Or having a place.
L:  Mhm.  So, I -- I think, you know, restaurants, that's okay, they can be non smoking, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, bars and things like that, n- -- and I know, um, the city I live in, it's not a r- real large city, but, um, we don't have -- it's -- it's real l- l- liberal as a rule, but we don't have too many restaurants that you can smoke in.
R:  M- mhm.
L:  And -- and of course, I don't -- I don't have a problem with that really, but I think they're talking about making it even more --
R:  Stricter, yes.
L:  -- more difficult, where you can't even --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, you can't even smoke in -- re- restaurants or bars or any place --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- or outside or anything, and -- and I just -- I just think that's just going way too crazy.
R:  Well, I know, my sister in law smokes and she refuses to go any place where she can't smoke.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, she just, uh, absolutely refuses, you know?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, a- a- and -- and I can understand that, because I was sort of like that myself when I smoked.  I, uh, i- i- it's very, you know, upsetting to go someplace --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and not be a- allowed to smoke.
R:  Well, uh, true, like she said before, "Why should I have get up and go outside? --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- It's cold out in the winter time" you know, or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  She says, uh, "I don't wanna have to get up and go outside whenever I wanna smoke".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So she just doesn't go places that -- you know?
L:  Mhm.  And unfortunately for her and -- and all the smokers, there aren't too many places left that -- that she can go. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think, as we said before, I -- they d- -- they do have -- they have their rights too.  I mean, this is still America so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they -- they do have their rights and I -- I think we need to be as tolerant of them as they have been of us, so I -- I, uh, you know, there's certain places that -- that -- there's -- I -- I really would like to see more education for the young kids.  I hate to see the young kids start to smoke because it's -- they don't realize, and it took me many, many years to realize what an addictive habit it really is.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's where they need -- need to do the work.  I -- I don't think the other -- [MN] the older people, the ones who are already smoking, there's not going to be that many, I don't think, give it up.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But the younger ones, if they can get them before they --
L:  Before they even start.
R:  -- start to smoke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and that's why I think if they could use some of the ads, some of the, um, oh, you know, [MN] don't make smoking glamorous and -- and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- maybe Hollywood's a little bit to blame there, because they do show a lot of people smoking in movies and things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I don't go to a lot of movies, but that's what I've heard, that, you know, they're all -- and a lot of the movies they see now are smoking and [SIGH] -- and maybe that, you know, there's no need for that, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that doesn't -- you know, that looks glamorous to kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and makes kids think it's cool and I know that's why I started smoking many years ago, I thought it was cool --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Want to be like other people. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Go with the crowd and [inaudible] --
