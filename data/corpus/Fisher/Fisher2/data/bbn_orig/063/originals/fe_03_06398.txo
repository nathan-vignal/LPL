R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Yvonne.
L:  Well, my name's Nancy.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you, Nancy.
L:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm, em, from Corpus Christi, Texas.
L:  Well, I'm from Missouri.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, we're supposed to say, I guess --
R:  About th- --
L:  -- how we would react to a terrorism attack.
R:  Oh, my goodness. [LIPSMACK]
L:  I really don't like to even think about that, that's --
R:  I know.  That's -- that's something -- [MN] that's very terrible, that's awful.
L:  Yes.  A few years back we didn't even have to.  Well, I guess basically for me it would depend how close it was to my home, you know.
R:  That's true, that's true.
L:  I mean, if it's, uh, right next door --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- uh, I think I'd be gathering the animals in the [LAUGH] house almost. [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH] Me too.  I have some cats and I'd be, like you said, just trying to hurry up and gather 'em up.  But, um, that's something to really think about.  You know, what would you do in a terrorist attack or an emergency like that?  Um, you wouldn't know until you go through it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and you ... first of all you pray, you know, that --
L:  That's the main thing, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You pray.
L:  Pray and work at the same time. [LAUGH]
R:  Time, yeah.  And work quickly.
L:  Right.  I mean, uh, for me --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I think to take off running would be a mistake, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Uh, you really know where to run, uh, I would --
R:  That -- that is a panic. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I would more, uh, rather stay in my home and try to fight it out, I guess.
R:  Right, me too.
L:  Uh, if it's biological then, you know, well, you're just going to have to hunker down.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  But you have to think fast and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  ... and like you said, think and pray at the same time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then react.
L:  I know maybe this isn't what they wanna hear but, uh, I believe in the Lord and if it's -- your time is up it's -- no matter what's going to happen, your number's up.
R:  And that's true.  That's true.  No matter how -- what kind of precautions that you have, you know, or safety, like you said, if it's your time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and your number, that's it.
L:  And --
R:  And if it's not, you will come through, you know, with flying colors.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  But that's something to think about, and -- [COUGH]
L:  Ah, but for me I don't think, you know, having, uh ... the plastic over the windows, to me -- we've got a +chimney in our house so it's going to come down the +chimney, and plastic over the windows doesn't make a lot of sense.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah --
R:  And, like, you know, a lot of houses have burglar bars.  They're good but ... um, you know, the burglars on the doors?  But then still if a fire broke out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you've got to hurry up and get that unlocked so you can get out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So you're, like, trapping yourself --
L:  You're goin- --
R:  -- and, you know --
L:  -- you're gonna save yourself from one thing and get into something else.
R:  Something else, you know, from a -- a terrorist.  It just ...
L:  Ah --
R:  ... is ...
L:  Frankl- --
R:  It's just this day and time, I -- I believe.
L:  Uh, frankly, I'm more --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- +worried, uh, during an attack of what the other people will do after the attack, be- --
R:  Right.  I think that's when you fall apart.
L:  Well --
R:  If you hold up good during it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then after it's all over with and you are okay, that's when you ... you shake, you know, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- might pass out.
L:  Well, I'm not that bad but -- uh, in a crisis I'm very calm, [LAUGH] actually I'm a wreck. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I try to be, but I -- I get -- I get a little nervous, I do, I get nervous.  Like, we had the tornado.  I, um ... when I -- when I didn't know it was, like, right beside me it was, like, okay.  But then after I found out everything was ove- ... you know, was over, then I said, "That could've been our house", you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But in a terrorist attack, my God.
L:  Well, you know, if --
R:  First of all, if he's in -- if he's trying to get -- if he's in the house, you want to try to talk to him calmly.  You know, to -- not to get him upset.
L:  Right.
R:  If he'll let you talk ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... because, you know, some of them, you know, want you to just hush.
L:  Uh, well, um, with him --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you stand a little bit of chance.  I've got a pit bull so [LAUGH] I don't worry too much [LAUGH].
R:  Right, so you have a lot of help, see. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, but, you know, for, uh, me, uh, with the terrorism, uh, biological is more of a +worry.
R:  It is.
L:  I will admit that I've planted beets this year --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which I don't normally, because, uh, my father's folks had small pox.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I know that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, raw beet juice will help 'em break out on you.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And so, you know, I mean, that's a little something, and I do keep Clorox in the house because I know a teaspoon of it in a gallon of water will purify the water.
R:  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- I keep it ar- around also.
L:  And --
R:  And, uh, I try to keep one in the kitchen and one in the restaurant.
L:  And then, you know, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- we've got a little extra food that we have put aside.  But we live in the country anyway so we're --
R:  Oh, that's so good.  I've always wanna lived in the country.
L:  Well, in the win- --
R:  It's peaceful.
L:  In the wintertime we're in here for two weeks at a time, so you --
R:  Oh, yeah, you're snowed in.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So we've learned, you know, to put a little extra up. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And so, you know, basi- --
R:  But to be isolated like that all to yourself, and then that is kind of dangerous if ... if -- say, like, if a prisoner broke out or ... like, the terrorists, or someone get loose.  They head for a -- a house that's off -- isolated to itself, so that --
L:  Well, uh, we're off the main path, so there are more, uh, down the highways, you know.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  And we're on a rural road.
R:  Oh.
L:  I guess, for me, I've been a -- you know, that doesn't really bother me.
R:  Uh-huh.  That's good.
L:  Now, uh, the honest, uh ... we used to ship our cattle and I'm really not too thrilled to cross the main bridges anymore.  We had to go across the Missouri River.
R:  Okay.  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And for me, that is something now that [LAUGH] I'm thinking about, "Do I want to send 'em the other direction?" because --
R:  Send -- right.
L:  -- after all this terrorism, I've got visions of going in the river, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  I mean, uh --
R:  I understand.  Yeah.
L:  I know we shouldn't let these people have any control.
R:  Oh, right.  And that's what they're doing.
L:  Right.
R:  They're in control of your life.
L:  And, uh, with all these alerts, they freak you out but then they -- the university, I heard a catch[?] on the news, they blew that up, you know.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  And if our children aren't safe, good Lord.
R:  N- -- I know.  Your children aren't safe at school and -- and like you said, we're living in the last days and ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... people -- it's -- it's -- it's bad, it's just really bad.
L:  Well, they're more like animals, a lot of 'em.
R:  I know. [LAUGH] That -- that's a good name for them.
L:  [LAUGH] A- --
R:  It -- it's -- it's bad, it's --
L:  And --
R:  I've never seen anything like this.
L:  Uh, you know --
R:  When I was growing up it wasn't -- it wasn't like this.
L:  No.  Well, you know, when we had nine eleven, we were robbed.
R:  Yes.
L:  That very night they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- come in and stole hay from our chickens.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so that's really -- uh, the citizens here are going to be more concerned, to me, if we have a terrorism attack --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- than, uh, the terrorists, because the people are gonna turn against each other.
R:  Th- that's right.
L:  They're gonna be more like animals than people.
R:  Ma- m- -- that's right.  You don't know who to trust.  And then --
L:  Well, basically, don't trust anybody. [LAUGH]
R:  No- [LAUGH] nobody.  Don't trust anyone. [LAUGH]
L:  And I saw 'em --
R:  But that's bad.
L:  That's bad because when I was a kid, you know, my dad would open the door to anybody.  Now --
R:  Yes, mine -- mine still do it.  I said, "Daddy, you can't do that".  He taught me not to, but now he's doing it. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh yeah --
R:  I say, "Oh, [inaudible]".
L:  -- daddies think they can win anything but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, they worry about their little girls. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I say, "Don't do that".  "Oh, it's nothing, it's no harm". [LIPSMACK] "I just open the doors" [several inaudible words] "Oh, my goodness, don't do that".
L:  Well, for me --
R:  People have changed.  It's a different generation.
L:  Right.  Uh, I mean, I don't open the door if somebody's having a problem.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I'll call for 'em or I'll call the sheriff.
R:  That's good, that's -- that's good.
L:  Uh, I won't leave 'em out there on the doorstep, you know, without getting them some help --
R:  Help, right.
L:  -- but I'm not allowing 'em in my home if I don't --
R:  And if they're for the right, they will stay there and wait for him.
L:  Right.
R:  And if they're not, they will flee.
L:  Right.
R:  Mm.
L:  A- -- we've had it both ways. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right, so I understand what you're saying.
L:  Uh, but, you know, I used to.  You'd say, "Come on in, have a cup of coffee". [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, "Sit down", you know, you're right. [LAUGH] Now you're inviting the enemy in.
L:  Right.
R:  You can't do that anymore --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- you just really can't.
L:  It's sad with all this terrorism, it has really turned the citizens against each other, you know.
R:  Each other.  Yes, it has.
L:  And, you know, that's pitiful.
R:  Bu- -- it is.
L:  And I'm the type of person that likes --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- to help people, but then, uh, the fear gets in the way.
R:  Ri- right.  I'd -- I -- I like to talk to people also.
L:  But --
R:  And, like ... like -- like you said, if you're traveling, and you're on the highway, and there's a lady with the hood up, you don't know if that's a lady for real or not, or you don't know if she's setting you up --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if someone's gonna come out of the bushes, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And you don't wanna leave her there, so it's best, you know, that you call up for her some help.
L:  Yeah, I'll call the Highway Patrol or somebody.
R:  -trol, uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  Because you just can't trust people.
L:  No, that's it.  It's just the same --
R:  And it's bad.  That's really --
L:  And then with our airport security, with all this terrorism --
R:  Oh, my goodness, that's something.
L:  Uh, we're losing a lot of our rights, too, which I really don't like, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's right.  You --
L:  Because that's what made America great is us to have our freedom.  And now --
R:  Right.  That's right.  Now you have to travel very light. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, well, frankly I don't, uh, think I r- -- I'd rather drive and take longer then fly --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because [LAUGH] --
R:  Me too, me too.
L:  And I know they say more wrecks on the highway.  Well, nobody's gonna [LAUGH] steal my car --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the highway.
R:  Right, well, that's -- the -- you travel in the daytime. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yes, yeah, you have to watch what you're doing and --
R:  That's true, that's true.
L:  And then the sad thing is now, you know, if you see a foreign person, it's a re- -- even really nice ...
R:  Um, yes.
L:  ... you give 'em a second look.
R:  Mm --
L:  And I feel sorry for them but then I'm only [LAUGH] human too.
R:  You don't know -- right, you don't know if you're --
