L:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Hi, I'm Carolyn.  How are you?
R:  I'm o- -- good.  I'm Elena[?]. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think we have about a minute to introduce each e- -- ourselves.  This is my first call.
R:  Yeah, mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, good. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, what do you mean, a -- a minute?  A- are they gonna cut us off or --
L:  [MN] They -- no, no, uh, we're supposed to talk about eight and a half minutes about the, uh, about the --
R:  Smoking.
L:  -- specific smoking.  Yeah.  Do you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smoke?  Uh --
R:  Um, well, I'm -- I'm and then -- I smoke, then I quit.  I smoke clove cigarettes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's like a slight indulgence, it's not a -- I don't smoke -- I smoke maybe two or three a day, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if -- if -- if that.  So, yeah, kind of. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I have to say --
R:  Um.
L:  -- I've never smoked.  Wait a minute.  Once in my entire life, I had to put a cigarette in my mouth when I was on stage for a play --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] -- and that was about it. [LAUGH]
R:  But it wasn't lit?
L:  Uh, no, it wasn't lit.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I had to, uh, you know, my mother used to s- -- my mother, both my mo- -- my parents smoked, God, uh, rest both of them, and, uh, both of them actually died from some complication of smoking, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I never picked up -- never picked up a cigarette in my life.  But I don't mind if people, you know, wanna smoke, just as long as it doesn't bother me.  That's -- you know, that's how I feel about it.  I don't know.  How do you feel?
R:  Well, we're talking about public ban, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Just ba- -- did it say banning inside or just anywhere?
L:  Well, I think that's up --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- to -- up to us to discuss.
R:  Yeah, I guess.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- it --
R:  Well, see, I li- -- I worked at, um, [LIPSMACK] an amusement park, well, Disneyworld and they have, um, designated smoking areas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which I think's a great idea because, you know, i- --  people -- there's kids, you know, 'cause there's kids around --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you don't want the kids exposed to smoke, you know, and there's characters, and the characters are, you know, obviously in a costume and -- and they don't need to have smoke around them.  I mean, if we didn't have any limits, you know, as to where you can smoke, I think, you know, people aren't very courteous in this day and age, so there --
L:  That's -- that's true.
R:  You know, they're just gonna smoke and blow it in whoever's face and they won't care --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I live in, um, in, uh, in Arizona, and there's a lot of towns that have started totally banning smoking and, uh, particularly like Tempe, and of course the bar owners are very upset about it because they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- claim that, uh, you know, they can't run their business if they've had a twelve percent, uh, I think in a -- in a business like that, like a bar with, y- you know, you -- you say you're going to sit down and have a drink and a smoke, that's fine, but you should have some kind of division between the dining area if people wanna go in there and not be bothered by it, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I'm not the kind of person that'll say, "You can't smoke, period, except in your house or your car".  I don't think that's fair.
R:  No, that's not, 'cause that's kind of like -- i- it's almost like a -- a restriction on your body, kind of --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Exactly.
R:  And that's kind of against the Constitution, so --
L:  Uh, right, right.  I mean, look what they tried to do with prohibition, that didn't work either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, definitely not. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I never heard about clove cigarettes.  What are they, anyway?  Are they herbs?
R:  Well, they're, um, yeah, they're herbal cigarettes and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they say they're just as bad as, uh, uh, for you as, you know, regular cigarettes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they don't have, um, nico- -- some of 'em do, but the ones that I smoke don't have nicotine and, uh --
L:  Do you feel that -- that, uh, that's it's addictive at all?
R:  Well, sure, I mean, you know, it's -- it's definitely -- anything.  I -- I think I have a -- anything I could addicted to, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, you know, if you -- you [several inaudible words] --
L:  Chocolate ice cream. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, exactly, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, it's a thing where, you know, I could -- like I'll -- I can go as long as I want to, really, without buying a pack --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, like, for instance, this weekend, like I didn't smoke.  I haven't smoked for, like, a week or two and I was, like, I just got kind of a little craving so I was, like, "Well, I'll indulge myself" you know, that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And, uh, you know, it doesn't bother me to, you know, go outside and smoke but, I mean, if I was a heavy smoker, you know, if I smoked, like, a pack or two a day --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- sure, you know, I'd be really ticked off if I had to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, walk outside after I had a big meal.
L:  Do you have children? [COUGH]
R:  No, no, I don't.
L:  So then -- i- -- well, what would -- you know, if you did, what would your feeling be about smoking around them and how would you wanna -- want them to, uh, perceive it?
R:  Well, I would -- no, I'd -- I wouldn't wanna smoke around my kids, like I would definitely -- and if I had, you know, if my husband or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was a smoker, I would say, "Out" you know?  I don't -- and I wouldn't wanna smoke in my own house, just because -- like, my Dad and his girlfriend smoke and the whole --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- entire house just smells like smoke and it's just really nasty.
L:  That's what I remember from my childhood is, you know, I'd go and hug my mother and all I could smell was, you know, she smoked Chesterfield [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- way back then, and that's all I remember, is the -- is the smell of that, and I used to hate that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess I was, you know, just predisposed not to.  I -- I've always heard that, you know, if your parents do something, e- either you're gonna go completely down the road with them or totally opposite and I went --
R:  Yeah, I think you're right.
L:  -- totally opposite, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's good.  So in -- in that case that's excellent. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, in this case it was good.  I- in this case it definitely was good.  But, um, no, I have to admit i- if I go into a restaurant and I can, you know, uh, they put me in a -- a n- -- a non smoking area and I can still s- smell smoke, I will either leave or I will ask to be moved.  I'm -- I'm a bit of stickler --
R:  Yeah, I don't like it either.
L:  -- you know?  But I don't -- I don't wanna go to the person and say, "You can't do that".
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  I will make it my business to move someplace else, you know, unless somebody's being a real jerk about the whole thing, you know?  And then -- well, what are you gonna do?  There's a lot of them in the world. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, actually, whenever I worked at Disney, see, you know, we were -- it was part of my job, I worked with the characters and it was part of my job to, like, tell the people, you know, "This is a non designated smoking area".
L:  Right.
R:  And a man, uh, like, there was a man around the characters with a bunch of kids, smoking a big, fat cigar --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I told him, I was, like, you know, "Sir" and the -- the designated smoking area was very close and, you know, a big fat cigar that -- that puts off a lot of smoke, and with kids around and a character --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- I wasn't having it.
L:  Sure.
R:  And so he -- he went off on me, he told -- he called me a -- a Nazi and [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Oh, gosh, you're kidding?
R:  -- people like that, they -- they get really mad because, you know, they're like, you know, hi- his thing was, "Well, it's outside, how can you tell me --" but, you know --"
L:  Mm.
R:  -- private property, you know, we can --
L:  Right.
R:  -- tell you whatever --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- but --
L:  Exactly.  But I do find that -- that both sides can get very, very, uh, involved and very vocal. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  They can --
R:  I mean -- go ahead.
L:  They can go ahead and really, you know, make a -- make a big thing out of it, instead of just, you know, as I said, try -- I -- I'll try and make things better for me without bothering anybody else, but, you know, some -- some people -- a friend of a girlfriend of mine, she -- she's kind -- she's a reformed smoker and i- it's true what they say, at least with her, she is absolutely adamant, I mean, she will stand there, in the l- -- in the loudest [MN] -- well, you know, voice possible and say, "Look at all that smoke coming over here" you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And really make a [LAUGH] -- make a big deal in front of everybody, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I kinda shrink and said, "Hey, why don't we just move, you know?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Why should I move?  It's my lunch" [LAUGH] and this, that and the other thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And she used to smoke, like, a pack a day, you know?
R:  Jeeze.
L:  So, uh, it's a v- --
R:  Yeah, I think it's a good idea just maybe, yeah, these public bans or -- I mean, in certain places I think it's a good idea, and I think it's a good step towards better health for the United States --
L:  True.
R:  -- you know?  I mean --
L:  Well, pa- --
R:  -- and -- and there's nothing wrong with that.
L:  Nothing wrong with that.  Part of the problem, like what's happening here in Arizona, is you'll get different cities doing it and then they, you know, i- -- they can go, like, from Mayford to Tempe, all they have to do is walk three blocks, so --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I feel sorry for the people, the bar owners and club owners that are on, you know, on the wrong side of that street --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know?  Because the smokers will just walk down the block and go into Mayford and that'll be that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's difficult and I can understand.  But, um, I think the people, the companies and the restaurants and stuff now, when they build or start new, they're taking all of these, uh, smoking bans into account and, um, like we were in a Bahama Breeze today, and they had a smoking area, but [LIPSMACK] couldn't tell it by me?  I mean, I just walked in, asked for non smoking, sat down, and, uh, never knew that there was a cigarette being used anywhere in that restaurant.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And I thought that, you know, that's smart.  That's smart, the way they --
R:  Yeah, maybe if they just made -- instead of, like, you know, a hardcore public ban everywhere, maybe if they just, you know, made, um, building codes a little bit different --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- like, you know, that -- that Bahama Breeze.
L:  Let the business -- yeah, let the business themselves choose.  It is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- their own property, or their own place --
R:  True.
L:  -- and, you know, if you wanna say, "This is a smoking restaurant" or, you know, fine, I can make the choice before I walk in the door to say, "Do I wanna go in or don't wanna go in" you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that would be, uh, that would be a better way to do it.  But who knows?
R:  And with a bar, that's just kind of unfair [LAUGH] because, you know, anybody who chooses to -- to go to a bar is going to expect a lot of smoke and --
L:  Of course.
R:  -- a lot of people smoking, so, I mean, you know, give 'em a break.
L:  I tell you, things have changed --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] things have changed a lot though, 'cause I remember when we used to go Las Vegas, you couldn't walk into a casino and you -- it would hit you like a wall when you walked into the door --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, uh, nowadays, uh, it's really not --
