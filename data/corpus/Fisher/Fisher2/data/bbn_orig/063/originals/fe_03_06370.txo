R:  Hello?
L:  Hello? [NOISE]
R:  Yes, my name is Sharon.  I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  I'm Michelle and I'm from Maryland. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, well, nice to meet you over the phone.
L:  You too. [NOISE]
R:  And I didn't quite hear exactly the --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-oh, my phone is rattling, just a second.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I'm on a cordless phone and it just makes all kinds of noises.
R:  Okay.
L:  I believe they said [SIGH] about [LIPSMACK] whether or not you think that, um, [SIGH] the centers to help quit smoking --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- are useful.
R:  Okay.
L:  I do know that is was pertaining to smoking and they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- say these things so quickly.
R:  Ri- -- I know, I know exactly what you mean.  Ah, but I guess in reference to that question, my opinion would be: yes -- I -- I don't smoke myself, I'll just --
L:  Nor do I.
R:  -- put it that way.  But I would think that, uh, you know, there are some smokers who do need all the support that they possibly can get.  And, um, I believe that, you know, those kinds of support, uh, measures can certainly help smokers to kick the habit.
L:  Well, I -- I agree, and add to it that it certainly doesn't seem that it could do them any harm. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, exact- [LAUGH].
L:  It can -- it can only be beneficial. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You are right about that.
L:  Yeah, yes.
R:  I do- -- I certainly don't think it's going to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, have them to -- smoke more --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than they are smoking, yeah.
L:  Yeah, because we're now approaching a -- a time in which it seems like smoking almost is going to be banned.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Which is going to be something that certainly will be done almost under cover, and it's almost at that point.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  The commercials that they have on now really depict the truth --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to, you know, to a great extend in terms of when people start pulling out cigarettes other people, like, you know ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right, that's true, that's very true.  And in fact, um, I just, uh, came back, uh, from a dinner engagement and, uh, one of the, uh -- one of my friends that I was with started sneezing and she says, "I can smell the smoke coming from the smoking section of the restaurant" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I could not smell a thing, quite honestly, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- apparently she, you know, has a sensitivity to smoke --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- and she was able, you know, to smell it right away, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you're right, uh, many of us nonsmokers are just, y- you know, very turned off by, uh --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- by smoking.  Yeah.
L:  And I do -- it does seem that there are many more nonsmokers than there are smokers these days.
R:  Yes, yes, that is true.
L:  So that's encouraging as well.
R:  Right, right.  Which is a good thing.  But I do know that, um, I know my husband, he, ah, works with, um, [LIPSMACK] -- he has a program in which he does, uh, anti tobacco, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kinds of activities, and the target audiences are teenagers.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, I really think that, you know, those kinds of activities can help our teenagers not to become smokers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, as -- as they become adults, and, uh ...  So I -- I think that those kind of prevention, uh, programs are very helpful ...
L:  Right.  Well, that -- that's good, that is, uh --
R:  ... to our youth, yeah.
L:  But, um, I'm hoping that more and more people will be encouraged not to smoke.
R:  Yes.  Yes, I hope so.  I hope so.  In fact, one of my coworkers, uh, today, was, uh, talking about her husband, and, um, he was having chest pains, and he is in his late forties and she, um, said that he had be- -- he's been a smoker since the age of twelve.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And I'm thinking to myself, you know, "What kind of condition are his lungs in?"
L:  Right.
R:  And I just -- I mean, I couldn't imagine anybody starting smoking at age twelve.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, continuing for, you know, thirty five or so years.
L:  Well, in actuality ... well, you say he's just in the late forties.
R:  Mhm, mm, I think she said he was forty seven.
L:  Um -- right.  We have a family friend who was smoking probably from about that time, but he's eighty ...
R:  Mm.
L:  ... eighty -- what, eighty two.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, when he began, it was a very common thing.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, when you get back to that generation --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they were not taught --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that this is the -- you know, something that's going to inevitably kill you.
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  So, he has a quarter --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of his lungs --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- that are functioning.
R:  Mm.
L:  So he is in and out of the hospital on a regular basis.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  As a matter of fact, he's -- I think he was just released this evening.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Mm.  And in -- you know, even going back to the, you know, classic movies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of the, you know, thirties and forties and fifties, it was v- very posh and in vogue --
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  -- you know, to smoke, you know, for the men as well as the women.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so ...
L:  And all of the commercials --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- subsequently that followed --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- um, were very catchy tunes and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, and encouraged you to, um, become a smoker --
R:  Yes, that's true.
L:  -- because it was just the thing to do.
R:  That's true, [inaudible].
L:  And Hollywood fully endorsed it.
R:  Yes, they did.  But I do like the antismoking commercials that they have now --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, [inaudible] and it's like the -- the people travel in packs.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess, uh, you know, kind of drawing a parallel to a pack of cigarettes.  And I think those commercials are so hilarious.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  And they really do make you pay attention to them -- we- -- to the message.
L:  Right.  Yeah, they have one in particular that -- they're digging in their nose --
R:  Ah -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's really quite gross.
R:  Oh, God -- [LAUGH]
L:  And --
R:  -- I don't think I've seen that one.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  You haven't see- -- oh, my goodness.
R:  I don't think I've seen that one.
L:  It's a group of teenagers.
R:  Uh -- uh-huh.
L:  And each one of 'em come out of the school and they go and take a seat or stand up on the pole --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they all begin plucking in their noses --
R:  Ugh.
L:  -- just plucking stuff.
R:  Ugh.
L:  And then the message is [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- smoking is just as repulsive. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh.  No, I don't think --
L:  And it was -- it's quite gross.
R:  Oh, gosh.  I don't think I've seen that one before.  That does sound --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- rather disgusting.
L:  Yeah, so they're -- they're coming out some -- with some things but, you know, [SIGH] these teens have their own mindset.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And if they -- they think that it's something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that -- that's good, then you can't discourage them from it.
R:  That's true, that's very true.  That's very true.  And I don't know what the statistics are these days in terms of, you know, whether especially young people are smoking more now than ever but, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know, I ... at least the younger people that are in my family, they don't smoke.  They -- they don't -- in fact, I ... in fact, I think everybody in my family -- well, that I'm, you know, really close to, no one smokes any more.
L:  Oh, well, that's good.
R:  No one smokes any more.  My father gave it up cold turkey about, um, oh gosh ... maybe about eight years ago.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And, um, my cousin, uh, gave it up about maybe five years ago.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I -- I can't think of one smoker that we have in our family right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not a one.
L:  I wish I could say likewise.
R:  Mhm.  Not a one.  Which is, um, I think that's, you know, that's pretty good.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Everybody's trying to acquire healthier lifestyles.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's a very good beginning.
R:  Yeah, it is, it is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It certainly is.
L:  A very good beginning.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well --
R:  But, uh, uh --
L:  -- let's just hope with all of the losses and things that are, um, hitting them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, you know, perhaps they would just -- I don't know, I guess you can't just really get rid of it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, exactly.
L:  Because that will never happen.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Because it's not illegal.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, I don't know where that's headed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, it is good to see that more and more places are really adhering to the fact that most people don't want smoke, even around them, and I agree --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with, um, you know, the person that was out with you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you're in a restaurant, I don't care if they, "Oh, it's nonsmoking".
R:  Mhm.
L:  As if it doesn't travel.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, the smoke moves, it doesn't stay in the nonsmoking, it doesn't know to do that, it's not trained.
R:  That's right.
L:  So [LAUGH] ...
R:  That is right. [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it gravitates to where you are.
R:  That is -- that is right.
L:  And I believe all of the stats say that secondhand --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- smoke is as bad, if not worse --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- than directly smoking.
R:  Yes, that is true, that is true.  And in fact, um, it -- it's funny because I -- I work with, um, schools and, um, [LIPSMACK] I do different trainings in schools and some men -- a -- a principal and -- and some [LAUGH] of the teachers, they have to go across the street from the school to smoke.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And there -- I guess it's the children -- some of the children have, uh, put up signs, they've typed them on a computer --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um, it ha- -- it -- and the sign says something about, "If you don't want us to smoke then you shouldn't smoke either" or [LAUGH] something like that.
L:  [MN]
R:  And I'm --
L:  Well ...
R:  -- thinking to myself, you know, "They're right", I mean, their --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, their role models are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, outside puffing away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Although I guess they think nobody sees -- the students don't see them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they -- they really do and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, they are kinda setting the tone.
L:  And not only that, it's -- it's an unfair [LIPSMACK] distraction --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because, you know, it -- it's unfair for ... uh, because you are, quote unquote, a smoker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be allowed to gravitate outside --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- four, five, six times --
R:  Yep, you're right.
L:  -- every day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for your little five or ten minute cigarette break --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- while the nonsmo- --
