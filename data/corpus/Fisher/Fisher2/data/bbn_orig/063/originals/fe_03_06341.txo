L:  Hi, I'm Leesha[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Barb, from Iowa.  How are you this evening, or this afternoon?
L:  Nice --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- nice to meet you.  I'm from Kansas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's -- it's quite interesting that this is the topic of conversation, um, because our community recently adopted a, um, a ban on smoking in public restaurants.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's been a very hot topic here in our community, um, it was passed unanimously by the, uh, the City Commission --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then we -- the voters -- i- -- the voters took it to a vote and passed it by a pretty large margin, but there's quite a bit of turmoil in the, uh, community, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm a non smoker [LAUGH] and --
R:  So am I, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and I was in favor of the [MN] -- of this.  I believe that, um, it's en- enjoyable now to go into public places and actually, um, enjoy your meal without having to deal with the smoking, um --
R:  Yeah, I agree with you.
L:  -- interference, um.  How do you feel about -- about that? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, actually the same thing has happened in our community, um, uh, probably about a year ago they, um, passed the no smoking ban unt- -- uh, in restaurants until, like, eight thirty in the evening, then they could, but, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, the, um, some of the businesses in our town, um, took it to, um, State Supreme Court [LIPSMACK] and just last week, I believe, um, they said that it is against state law to have this ban. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so -- so, uh, um, the -- a lot of the re- -- not a lot, but some of the restaurants have, um, gone back to having smoking.  Um, fortunately the ones that I've gone to are -- are still, um, keeping a smoking ban, um, they -- the city government, uh, urged to them to, you know, honor it even though it was no longer a law.  But they're hoping that, um, this, uh, the next legislature will pass a law so that, um, it will be legal to do this.  But I -- I'm not -- I didn't even understand why it wasn't legal for the city to do that, but they said they overstepped their bounds.  And, um --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] So --
L:  I'm surprised, yeah, I'm surprised that, um, the voters here who, um, weren't in favor of it don't try to get it overturned by -- by taking it higher, but --
R:  Yeah, it may -- it may happen, um, uh, there were rumblings about it for a while here, um, for -- and then, I don't how long the case was in the courts but, um, I think it's probably been spread, um, I know s- statewide, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that this ha- -- uh, happened here and it may even be nationally that, uh, others will try it then too, but, um, I -- I -- I was really upset about it, but so far where, uh, where we are going it doesn't seem like, um, uh, they're having smoking yet, which is wonderful, and --
L:  Right, our community is taking a very proactive approach --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, uh, non smoking and they're very, um, proactive in the respect that they're taking it into the schools and they've appointed, um, people from -- we've got a -- it -- it's called, um, Salina Area Prevention Partnership --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they deal with non smoking and, um, drug related issues and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they actually have somebody that -- that goes in and talks to students in schools about --
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah.
L:  -- smoking and -- and pre- presents it in a very, um, unfavorable light. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm, right.  Yeah, I grew up --
L:  Um, I went to a parent teacher conference and they had a big display set up and showed a lung that had been, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that of a deceased person due to lung cancer and, I mean, it's pretty -- pretty vivid. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, pretty graphic.  That's -- that's really great, yeah.  Um, I grew up with a dad that smoked a pipe and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, I guess while I was living at home I didn't even realize, you know, how bad it was, but it came to a point where when I go back home and stuff, um, you know, he'd light up a [LAUGH] -- "Would you please not do that?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you're in the car, you know, and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you just -- you just felt like -- like your air was -- well, it was polluted and, um --
L:  Well, yes, I grew up -- I --
R:  -- but my Dad got really mad, he did. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my parents both smoked and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as a child, we would take road trips for vacations --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I would get carsick.
R:  Right.
L:  And I realize, as an adult now, it was because they were smoking in the car --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it wasn't because of the motion of the car, it was the smoke.
R:  Right, and all cooped with that.
L:  And I -- I visit 'em now, and I know when I visit them I have to come home and I have to wash my clothing and everything and --
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  -- and it -- it [LAUGH] --
R:  My sister in law, she smokes and -- and every so often she would sub, um, for me when my husband and I couldn't take my son to tai kwon do, she'd, um, sub, and he goes, "Well, I -- I won't go with her.  I won't get into the car" you know?  He said, "I just stink when --" [LAUGH] and you do, he just -- he'd come out of it and just stink.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just -- and my husband would go to her -- her -- her house and come home and he'd be there a short period of time, and you could just smell it on him.  It's just --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- oh, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But I think it's wonderful that, uh, communities are doing this, and I hope the legislatures will follow through here in Iowa and -- and, um, make it so it is legal to do this. [LAUGH] 'Cause I know -- and, um, Iowa city was doing it too and -- and I think there were several communities --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and our -- our, um, council decided not to rescind the law.  I guess there are a lot of laws on the books but they just get enforced, you know?  Things from the nineteen thirties or something and -- and, um, uh, you know, you can't ride a horse through town or something, [LAUGH] you know, but they don't -- they don't enforce a lot of that stuff.
L:  That's just too bad.
R:  Yeah.  But I guess, um, uh, some, like I -- I heard Iowa city was going to, um, rescind the law, but our -- our city council is hopeful that, um, the legislature will make it legal and then they can go ahead and enforce it, and they won't have to go through all the hassle again, uh, you know, it -- it was a hot item.  I'm sure it was in your town too, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of heated discussion a- and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- to get it through city council, so I guess -- I guess that's probably okay that they --
L:  Well, I know our attorney general was one of those involved in suing the tobacco companies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for false advertising, or for trying to entice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, teenage --
R:  Ours was too --
L:  -- smokers.
R:  -- and you know what?  The -- it was -- it, um, R.J. Reynolds, I believe, funded the -- the, uh, six to eight businesses, whatever, here in town, that they funded the court battle for them --
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  -- isn't that wonderful?  Yeah, I think that was just awful.  I just [SIGH] [LAUGH] but, um --
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, big tobacco, it's still there. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Well, yeah, you know, um, here in -- in our community and I'm sure in yours too, um, they've raised the price of, um, a carton.  I mean, it's about twenty five dollars a carton or more --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- and people are still buying them. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  And then they're -- you -- well, yeah, I've heard that too, that, you know, they -- they use the extra taxes on that for, you know, for funding other kinds of things, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- it's just a revenue item [LAUGH] for the state, [SIGH] and --
L:  Probably so.
R:  -- it's really bad, it's, like, you know, [SIGH] it's [SIGH] -- you know [SIGH] --
L:  I agree. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know, [LAUGH] I've seen it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, you know, these people are killing themselves or others and then to profit off of it, it seems very odd.
L:  Well, I know that, um, part of -- part of our prevention techniques we use here in our community are, um, that we offer -- or that they offer a smoking +cessation classes and it's free --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- and they provide with you, um, patches and, I mean, they really try to help those get off of smoking if they really, honestly --
R:  Right.
L:  -- want to make the effort.
R:  Right.  That's great.
L:  And I think that's great.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I know that they, you know, they have, um, several different, um, support groups here in town that meet to, uh, you know, help you, you know, try to quit and --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- I just think it's wonderful.  I think that, you know, I hope people take it up -- take up more -- more of these resources that are out there --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- to help 'em.
R:  Yeah.  My husband, um, chews tobacco and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's a really bad habit, but if you -- I think it's even worse than smoking, because they -- they get [SIGH] -- in their saliva, you know, they just g- -- they -- they absorb so much of that stuff and it's just -- he's tried and tried and I don't know if -- and he doesn't think patches will work for him, for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for, um, chewers, I don't know, but it's really -- it's really scary, the things that can --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- happen. [LIPSMACK]
L:  And you can get -- you can get cancer of the -- the -- the mouth and the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- gums and the lips.  It's --
R:  I know this, a- and, you know, he's seen pictures of this but, you know, it's --
L:  Oh, dear. [LAUGH]
R:  -- they have it in -- they've had in the magazines and stuff and [SIGH] -- but he still continues.  He's trying to cut back at least, but it's -- it's -- it's a really bad habit and, um, [LIPSMACK] and actually, I -- I think he -- yeah, he -- before I met him, long before I met him, he, um, he smoked, but he had quit that and then his Dad chewed and, um, somehow he started taking a little pinch of his Dad's stuff and -- and then all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all of sudden he was hooked in a habit.  And it's really bad.
L:  Well, I grew up, um, again, my parents both smoked but, u- um, because of that experience, um, I have, uh, two y- -- two younger siblings and, um, one of my siblings and I, we both [MN] protest smoking completely, but then my youngest one, she took it up.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And, um, in high school, [LAUGH] um, [LIPSMACK] which, you know, um, it's -- it's really bad, especially -- she did when she was expecting, when she was pregnant and --
R:  Oh, wow, yeah.
L:  -- we just tried to get her to quit and we did everything we could and I don't know if it was [LIPSMACK] my parents, you know, her growing up around that, I mean, obviously it wasn't an influence on my -- my other sister and I [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right, yeah.
L:  -- 'cause we -- we looked at it in a negative light, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my -- my younger sister she just -- she will not give it up, and I think she does it just to protest, you know --
R:  Oh, to spite you guys, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Hey, I can do this.  This is my freedom". [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  So, I -- I [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know, I think that there's a l- --
