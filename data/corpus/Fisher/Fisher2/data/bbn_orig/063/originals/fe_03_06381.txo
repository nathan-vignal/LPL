R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Alison.
L:  Hi, Alison, I'm Laurie.
R:  Hi, Laurie.
L:  How are ya?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  Pretty good. [LAUGH]
R:  Good.
L:  This is kind of an interesting topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.
L:  And do you -- 
R:  I --
L:  -- smoke? [LAUGH]
R:  Go ahead. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you smoke?
R:  I used to be a smoker, actually.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I quit in August.
L:  Oh, good for you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, it was the best thing I've ever done. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, congratulations.
R:  How about you?  Are you --
L:  I have never smoked in my life. [LAUGH]
R:  Good for you.  My partner is the same way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm just impressed by people who can get through life ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well --
R:  ... without ever having tried --
L:  -- it wa- -- it was something I was never really, uh ... thank goodness I was never really introduced to it.
R:  Yeah, that's great.
L:  But it was also something that I've always been taught by my parents that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's not good for you, so ...
R:  Yeah, see, both of my parents smoked so I think --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that that ...
L:  Yeah, see, that usually hands down. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah, I've -- I've never even been tempted by it, I just, you know -- I think a lot of it is, you know, they were mentioning that we were to discuss the ads and the anti-smoking campaigns.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  I think a lot of that does subconsciously help you to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- realize how it, you know -- because they used to smoke a lot, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- way back when -- and it -- thought it was cool and it was great and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it was the thing to do.  But now they've got a lot more education as far as --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- health -- health problems, so ...
R:  I love those ads -- I don't know if you've seen them, it's mostly young people that are in the ads and they are, like, on the street and they read something from a tobacco company memo, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's just horrible, damning things where the tobacco company people have said, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "We wanna get more children smoking, and we want" -- you know, and --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  I think that --
L:  I haven't seen that.  I haven't seen that.
R:  Yeah, maybe they're only -- I'm on the West Coast, so I don't know, it could be that they're --
L:  Yeah, I am too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?  Okay, the last person I talked to was, like, all the way across the country.  Uh --
L:  Yeah, me too, I d- -- I had --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is only my third call and, ah, uh, you know, I [MN] wasn't sure if this was even, you know, going to work but --
R:  Yeah.  Ye- --
L:  -- it's pretty interesting, you know, and --
R:  It is interesting.
L:  I've talked to two different people in different parts of the country so it's kind of interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- I've never really even had the issue of smoking.  I -- I actually grew up in -- in the Carolinas where, you know, tobacco's a big issue --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- but, um, you know, I -- my parents I think tried it once when they were younger --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, but never -- never really smoked.  My dad smoked a cigar -- or a -- yeah, a cigar --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- once or twice and he smoked a pipe for a little while and I actually --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- enjoyed the way that smelled. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I never had the temptation to smoke it, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, they've always brought us up, ah, [MN] to believe that it's not a good thing, so --
R:  Yeah, well, it isn't.  I mean, it's so ridiculous that you're paying somebody to kill ya, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Oh, I know.  You know, I had a neighbor once who, um, [MN] was telling me that she quit smoking and she sa- -- she -- between she and her husband, they saved twenty five hundred dollars a year just --
R:  I'm sure that's --
L:  -- on cigarettes.
R:  -- true, yeah.
L:  You know, not -- not buying cigarettes.  And I said, "Wow, just think of it, you know, you could buy a boat or --" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- you could buy, you know, a car, a small car, [LAUGH] you know --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- something d- -- put money down on a car, anyway".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I said, "Just think, y- you know, how many years -- you could put that money into a house and" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, it's just --
R:  I mean, it's amazing.  Like, you flush so much money down the toilet by [LAUGH] smoking.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  It's ridiculous.
L:  I have a brother who smokes and drinks.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I -- you know, he's in dire straits.  He has four kids, and I said, "You know, just think --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- you guys would probably make it if you didn't smoke and drink" and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, he doesn't listen.  He tried to quit but I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's done it for so many years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How did you -- how did you quit?  Did you ...?
R:  Well, I spent a month with a friend of mine --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] in the summer.  Went to visit her and help her out with her business and, um, [LIPSMACK] she really is very much against smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she actually made me a mix tape.  And one of the songs on the mix tape was called, "Stop smoking".
L:  Ah.
R:  And it's just -- it's a really lovely song about, like, why we smoke and why we shouldn't smoke and -- and it's a really -- it's a pretty song, too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so I kept listening to the mix tape when I came home.  And I listened to it so many times that it got to the point where every time I lit a cigarette, the song would start going through my head and I would --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- think, "Why am I doing this?"
L:  Very good idea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You didn't even have to get professional help, that's great.
R:  Exactly.  It was awesome, um --
L:  That's great, yeah.
R:  But I mean --
L:  Well, my -- my husband and I both have asthma so we [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- we can't even go in a place where there's smoke.  We --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we were looking at a used car to purchase not too long ago and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I felt really bad s- -- asking people if it had been smoked in but, you know, I have to make sure.
R:  But it's a health issue for you.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  It's a health issue for you, you know --
L:  Yeah, it is, it really is and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, I've -- I get to the point where, like, my eyes will -- will water even if I'm --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- there around, you know, where had i- -- it had been --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I mostly just can't breathe.  And my husband's worse.  He -- he had really --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- bad asthma so -- you know, and it's just funny --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- he's -- he actually was a fireman and i- it was incredible how many --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- firemen smoked. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He says, "They don't get enough of it in their lungs during the week, I guess --"
R:  That's so -- mm.
L:  "-- so they have to smoke on the, uh, out time".  But --
R:  Yeah, I had a roommate who had terrible, terrible asthma, and she smoked.  And --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I just couldn't imagine, you know --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- I mean ...
L:  Yeah, that -- that's gotta be the worst, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think -- think the asthma was another, you know, deterring factor for me, it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something that I never, you know -- but it's -- it's actually a -- a religious choice too, you know, for us --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so [MN] we don't smoke and we don't drink so ...
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And hopefully we'll live longer. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what I'm hear- -- I told, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, and I mean it -- I don't know if you'll live longer but you might have a healthier --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- old age, you know.
R:  -- a happy -- happier years and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you might feel better -- you know, I have -- I have grandparents who smoked and grandparents who didn't, um, on either side, and the ones who didn't a- are -- are -- much better health at their old age.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And the ones who did -- actually, my grandmother just passed away and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she hadn't smoked for about ten years but she smoked for about thirty before that --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and, uh -- yeah, she -- she died a pretty young age.  But I don't know if it had anything to do with that.
R:  Right.
L:  She just had a lot of problems around that, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm very much for the anti-smoking ads.  I -- I --
R:  Yeah, I think they're great.
L:  -- just can't stand to walk down the street or drive down the street --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and see a little teenage -- [LAUGH] young teenager --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- li- lighting a cigarette, it just -- you can imagine what it does to their lungs.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  So, what do you think about the banning of smoking in public places?  Do you think that's, like --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- the way to go, or ...?
L:  Well, I think that they have a right to do what they wanna do outside a public building.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But I agree that it [MN] [SIGH] it interferes with the air inside a building.  You know, I think --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- that there's no way you can get around it.  I mean, I -- remember when they had the smoking and nonsmoking sections of restaurants and --
R:  Yeah, and it just did nothing.
L:  Yeah, I -- I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you -- you sit anywhere the n- -- the smoking section and you might as well be sitting right there --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- in it, so ... [MN] But, um, oh, I -- I think that people have a constitutional right to b- -- do what they want, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- outside of the building --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as long as it's not, you know ... I -- I've been standing outside a building before where someone's smoking and I have -- I have two little kids and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that's where it offends me the most is, you know, if somebody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- isn't courteous enough to not smoke around them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, 'cause it does -- you can still, you know, get -- catch the -- the breeze of it and --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  So I --
R:  Even when I smoked I -- I tried not to smoke around children.  I mean, I just think it's --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that --
R:  -- something that kids don't need to --
L:  -- that -- it didn't bother me as much i- if it was just me standing there, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But when you have little ones and you're standing there with 'em and you don't want them to be [LAUGH] affected by it.
R:  Right.
L:  I think -- I think it's rude if someone would, you know, light up a cigarette right in front of my kid or --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- right around them but -- [COUGH]
R:  Definitely.
L:  Other than that, I think, you know, if they want to go off by themselves and smoke, that's their own choice. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  I -- I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't say, you know, that about anything.  I mean, people have the right to drink, but it's not good for 'em [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I mean -- and they have the right to do other things that aren't necessarily good for 'em, but they do it anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, people speed in a car to --
R:  Right.
L:  It's against the law, but [LAUGH] they, you know, they'll do it because they have that choice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that's the great thing about America, but -- [MN] but, yeah --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- I think that it -- I think it's just more of a -- an etiquette issue than anything else, you know, but --
R:  What about in, like, restaurants or things like that?  Do you think that they should [inaudible] be able to smoke there?
L:  Um ... I don't, simply because I've worked in that industry before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, I know how it affects the food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've -- I've heard that it, um, affects the food, uh, greatly.  I worked in a, um, an ice cream parlor --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where they allowed no smoking because it -- actually the ice cream will absorb the smoke flavor.
R:  Oh, that's vile. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think for that reason that they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- should be allowed to, you know.  I -- I think --
R:  I mean, it really does interfere with your enjoyment of food --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, if there's this smell hanging in the air.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and you can ev- -- if you're a nonsmoker you can actually -- and you probably experienced this since you stopped smoking, but you probably --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- didn't notice it while you were smoking this is what my brother says, he says he doesn't notice other smoke smells while he's smoking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but when he quits, after a while he'll notice it, you know, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you go into a, um, if you go into a hotel room that has been smoked in --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- immediately you can tell.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, we got a rental car once that was supposed to be a nonsmoking rental car and immediately we could tell.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean, it wasn't -- it didn't have any burn or anything in it, just the smell, the -- just the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- stagnant smell of the smoke.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I think it -- yeah, it has its lasting effects. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Yeah.  But I think --
L:  But I can understand you being a smoker after your parents were because you were around it all your life --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's, like, the thing to do.
R:  Well, you know, I -- my mom --
