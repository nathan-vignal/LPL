R:  Hi. [NOISE] Out. [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Hang on, I have a [LAUGH] [NOISE]--
L:  You have a k- -- a child there?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, she's a one year old. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  Are you okay?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- she was just -- she was just getting in her toy box.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  They said that the -- the topic is smoking.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Are you a smoker?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, yes?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So, how you feel about this?
R:  [NOISE] Feel about what?  The -- the [NOISE] --
L:  The banning, like --
R:  The banning?
L:  -- in public places?
R:  [NOISE] I -- [NOISE] some of it bothers me, like restaurants, but when it comes to, like, um, malls and places like that, it doesn't bother me as much. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's always when you're on the phone, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Huh?
L:  It's always when you're on the phone.
R:  Oh, she's just mad at me 'cause I told her -- she -- I took her away from something. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you ever tried to quit?
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah?
R:  [NOISE] And it doesn't work. [LAUGH]
L:  No?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  No?  Huh.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  See, I'm not a smoker --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so that's why I wouldn't really know.
R:  [NOISE] I been smoking for, [NOISE] um, almost [SIGH] fifteen years. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [NOISE] So [NOISE] --
L:  And did you smoke when you were pregnant?
R:  [NOISE] Hm?
L:  Did you smoke when you were pregnant?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Because I do know a lot of people who quit just for that time.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I tried and I -- [NOISE] I couldn't do it and all my kids turned out healthy. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Really.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's good.  Good.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and I got -- I got lucky, I know. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I know I shouldn't of, but [LAUGH] --
L:  No, but that's good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Now, I know in around --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- our area --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have banned smoking in restaurants and other public buildings --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  but they haven't banned them in all restaurants, like they made smoking sections --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're trying to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but that hasn't really come about yet.
R:  [NOISE] No, yeah, here they haven't -- I live in Illinois [NOISE] and [NOISE] they haven't done -- start -- they've tried to start it here in bars and in some restaurants and it hasn't worked yet.
L:  No.
R:  No, I --
L:  N- --
R:  -- too many people are against it. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Well, that's it.  I don't know.  I think -- I think the -- it h- -- isn't so bad, but I know it makes it very inconvenient.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I wish I could quit.  I've tried everything, [NOISE] I've tried hypnosis -- [NOISE] [COUGH] I've tried hypnosis, I've tried the patch, I've tried everything and [NOISE] I just can't do it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.  A- a- apparently it's hard, once you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really get going, it's very hard.
R:  [COUGH] Oh, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, regardless of the cost, [NOISE] I mean, that's -- I don't like doing it 'cause of my kids, 'cause they don't like it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] I wish I --
L:  And like I say, they don't have -- like, my children all have allergies.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, you know, it would -- would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be hard for them anyway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if we did.
R:  [NOISE] No, mine -- mine don't have allergies or anything, they just don't like the smoke.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just [NOISE] wish I could quit.  My husband can quit, like at the drop of a hat, [NOISE] I just can't. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  [NOISE] What do you want? [NOISE] Oh. [MN]
L:  But otherwise -- so -- oh, so your husband smokes now or he doesn't?
R:  Yeah, he does.  He quits whenever he wants though. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's --
R:  He's got it -- he can do it easy, I don't know why.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But he can quit whenever he feels like it.
L:  That's good.  Oh, that's good.
R:  I mean, half our family smokes, I think that makes it harder.
L:  Oh, sure, sure.  'Cause then when everybody gets together, yeah, what are you going to do?
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And at parties.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's all we ever [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm not staying in the kitchen, Carla. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, she's not happy, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wish it was an hour away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it would be bedtime.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's true.  You're earlier over there, 'cause you're -- y- yeah, you're about --
R:  It's seven fif- --
L:  -- two hours earlier f- -- than me.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's only seven fifteen here.
L:  Yeah.  No, that's -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just after nine here.  That's why.  'Cause I know, mine are in bed. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, no, I've got at least an hour left. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's -- that's tough, 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially 'cause they're getting tired.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's just --
R:  No, it's [NOISE] --
L:  No, that's good.
R:  Um, now what is this study for, or this thing for?
L:  This is to study ways of people g- -- speaking and gathering information.
R:  Oh.
L:  Have you been on the website?
R:  I w- -- I -- I just went to it today --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, and had signed up today.  Actually, it was not even, like, four hours ago. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow, that's pretty quick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE] And, uh, I haven't checked my email, like, you know, 'cause like I said, I just did it, like, four hours ago. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty good.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I wasn't -- [NOISE] Carla, there's no more left in there.   Come here.  Um --
L:  Well, that's --
R:  -- I mean, what type of information do they want us to gather?  Just, you know --
L:  Well, I -- I think it was pretty much just how people exchange information.  It's -- it's some kind of a language study, from what I've read.  Um, in fact, on the website, they had, like, different topics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I was kind of curious to see what topics they were going to ask about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because they actually listed them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there were a lot of them.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um, but that's -- that's it.
R:  I know, 'cause the [NOISE] recording that I had got before you got on the line, it was, um, about smoking and [NOISE] banning, and it -- at first, 'cause she was screaming in the background [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I couldn't really +hear -- hear it --
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I didn't know if it was, you know, a survey or, you know, what was going on with it.
L:  No, I think -- I think it's just to see how people exchange information --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, it's some kind of, uh, um, it's some university, I think it's University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the -- it's -- I -- I think it's more of a language study than anything.
R:  Yeah.  Wow, it's weird.
L:  Yeah, no, I think it's kind of interesting.
R:  I always -- I -- I l- -- I just love the way people come up with these studies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Let's see how strangers will talk. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's it, and I guess that's the whole idea is that, you know, we've never met before so, you know, how -- how we bring up what we're bringing up. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, believe me, it's been one of those days here.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] I've got -- I've -- I've got a six year old, a four year old and -- and a one year old.
L:  Oh, that's a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, boy.  No, I have -- I have a seven, and three year old twins.
R:  Well, it's the same amount as mine.  I got -- you got the same amount of kids as me.  Now, granted, I -- I'd rather have what I have than twins. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Well, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think -- see, sometimes I think it's harder when they're at different ages, because they ha- -- they have different needs. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yes and no.  I mean, I think -- I think I had my kids, like, at the perfect time, 'cause I had my first two two years apart, and then I had, um, my daughter almost three years difference from my son, which is a big help. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it also depends on the sex of the children.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause my first one was a girl --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and she was -- she was easy, she was potty trained at two, sh- -- uh, you know, eighteen months [NOISE] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, um, and then I had my -- my daughter that I have n- -- m- my one year old now, I had her when my son was just about ready to be potty trained. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So he --
R:  So I had 'em at a good age, you know, good different times.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's great.  No, because i- it's -- it's true though, in that case --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it did make it a little bit different.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  No, that -- that helps a lot.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But that --
R:  But, believe me, I don't know what I would do with two twins at her age right now. [NOISE]
L: Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I guess -- well, that's why they go to bed early. [LAUGH]
R:  God.  Next up from her, she's my late night one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, this -- her being cranky right now is shocking.  Normally, she's a happy baby at this time. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] See, normally that -- [NOISE] you wanna go take a bath? [NOISE] You wanna take a bath? [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] Come on, you gonna go take a bath?  We go take a bath. [NOISE] Well, then don't take a bath. [NOISE] She's norm- --
L:  Does that tire her out?
R:  No, she just loves taking baths. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's good, that's good.
R:  I think she's overtired today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Had a busy day, huh?
R:  Yeah.  But I know if I put her to bed right now, she's gonna be up at five o'clock in the morning. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, oh.  That wouldn't be too good.
R:  Definitely don't want that to happen.
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And you have a helper there, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, no, he's not my helper. [NOISE]
L:  No? [LAUGH]
R:  He -- sometimes he's worse help than anything. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  Honey, she wants [NOISE] -- she doesn't want it. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Well, and it doesn't help with my husband working a late night. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No, that doesn't help at all.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, where in Illinois are you?
R:  [NOISE] I'm about an hour away from Chicago. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I -- I've -- I've been to Chi- --
R:  [NOISE] Towards the -- towards the Wisconsin border. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so you're west?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I've been to Chicago a couple of times.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I actually like the city, I think it's a nice city.
R:  It's nice -- [NOISE] I mean, it's -- and the way I feel, [NOISE] my husband, we moved down to Kentucky for a year [NOISE] and [NOISE] I missed Illinois [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, it's -- it's -- I -- in my opinion, it's one of the safest places to live, [NOISE] you could say. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yes.  Even in -- more like --
R:  [NOISE] Because we don't get -- we don't really get the blizzards like New York does --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we don't get the hurricanes like Florida does, [NOISE] we don't get the earthquakes and stuff like California [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where I live in Illinois, we don't really get [NOISE] -- where I live in Illinois, we don't really get tornadoes either.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we get the rain, we get the [NOISE] -- you know, we get other things that --
