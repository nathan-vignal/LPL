L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Mike.
L:  This is Alisa.
R:  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Good, how are you?
R:  Good.  Where you from?
L:  South Lamport.
R:  From where?
L:  South Lamport in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Minnesota so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  My brother usually does this but I answered the phone so ...
R:  Oh.
L:  He told me he'd give me five bucks for it so I'm like, "All right".
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's talking about smoking, I guess?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what do you feel about it?
L:  Um, well I don't smoke and I don't like it when my friends do around me that much 'cause, I don't know, it kinda bugs me [LAUGH].
R:  Right, that's --
L:  What about you?
R:  -- understandable.
L:  Mm?
R:  I said, "That's understandable".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm a -- I don't know what you would call, uh -- [NOISE] hold on a second I'll tell my kids to keep it down a little bit.  I'm, uh, kind of an ex smoker I guess you would say.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, uh, I smoked but I -- I gave it up and I don't know I guess that truly if it's such a bad thing and everybody thinks it shouldn't -- people shouldn't smoke, it should be outlawed if that's how they feel about it, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I don't know how to explain it but it's -- it's not a -- it's not outlawed --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's not illegal, I mean, pot is outlawed but then people shouldn't smoke that or can't smoke that, I guess, without being in trouble but if it's legalized and people are over the age of twenty one and -- and they should be able to do what they want, I guess.   When -- I mean it is a free country, I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I don't know how you feel about it but I --
L:  Well, I don't think they should, like, advertise it so much because especially -- 'cause of the younger crowd.  I think they should have it illegal for people under eighteen to be smoking because it's legal for us to be smoking, just not to buy it, I guess, when you're eighteen.  And I think it should be illegal to smoke it too when you're eighteen.
R:  Right, well that is true and then -- but I also feel too that if they wanna -- it's illegal for people under eighteen to -- to buy cigarettes and -- and have cigarettes that -- like in my town here I see a lot of 'em that are underage and smoke but it's not enforced.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and if people are gonna -- if the police don't enforce it -- even the parents, you know, the parents will buy for an underage person, you know, where does it start to be -- who's held responsible for it, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you can't hold tobacco companies responsible if the parents are -- are, uh, purchasing it for -- for their kids who are underage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, letting -- letting the kids do it so, you know, the whole thing about when the -- the tobacco companies got sued for everything, uh, I guess I found that was a lot of bunk, I guess, because, you know, how could they be held responsible or something they have no control of.  They -- they're supplying a product that is legal and then the parents are giving this legal illegal product to their kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's -- and people know that it's bad for 'em.  You know, like I said, I'm an ex smoker, within the last three months, but how can a tobacco company be held responsible for something people know is illegal, or not illegal but gonna hurt them --
L:  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  I mean, like, 'cause they have to make a living too.
R:  Well, exactly.  I mean it's -- and it even goes down to where -- you know, how the -- how the government subsidizes farmers.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they're subsidizing tobacco farmers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but they wanna stop smoking but they can't because if the government stops smoking, you know, how muc- you know, how much the government makes off of -- off a pack of cigarettes?  Between the states and federal, they make two to four dollars a pack off of the cigarettes.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I mean, how can they -- how can they on one side of the face say, "We're gotta cut smoking" but they can't because that's all tax money for them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so it's -- I can't agree with anything the government has to say about that 'cause I -- to me I find it, you know, so two faced, they want you to quit but they can't let you quit because they have to make the -- the money, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, it -- to me I --
L:  It isn't -- I don't think they're ever gonna do anything about it.
R:  Well, they can't, I mean, there's no doubt about that.  As I said, I haven't smoked in three months since I had a cigaret- well, I had a cigarette, two cigarettes on Saturday and I had one today and I couldn't stand the taste of it, you know, so it -- that doesn't bother me but I just feel that if it's a legal substance that you're old enough to buy, you shouldn't be told when you should do it and how you should do it or whatever.  I mean, I -- that's point of view of it.  Uh, I understand your point of view where you said that it disgusts you and stuff, which is cool.  I mean that's --
L:  Yeah, I mean, like I don't mind if my friends smoke it's just like when I'm in the car and we're like in an enclosed space --
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- I hate it when they're, like, "Oh, you know, stop whining blah, blah, blah" it's like, "Well, you know, you're kinda like affecting my health just 'cause it's your choice" you know.
R:  Yeah.  And even when I was -- you know, even when I did smoke I couldn't stand being in a small space with smokers because I can't stand the -- I couldn't stand the smoke, I still can't -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and I don't -- I don't like cigarette smoke but I like to have one once in a while.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I couldn't stand, like you were saying, in a car --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you get one or two or three people lighting up and that's just small -- it just gets -- I can't talk and I get all, you know --
L:  Yeah, it's just like it's -- it [LAUGH] gets really bad.
R:  [LAUGH] It's rude, I mean it's -- it's --
L:  And it's like, yeah, they don't, like, understand and I'm like, "Can you put that out or can you, like, wait or something?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like hold your head out [LAUGH] the window [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.  The thing that jerks[?] me off the most about -- I mean, like I said I -- I know people can smoke and do whatever they wanna do but the thing that pisses me of the most about it is when you see a parent that has a window cracked open one to two inches --
L:  And the kids inside.
R:  -- and one to three to four kids in the car.  And it's like, "How can you -- you know, how can you sit and smoke your cigarette --"
L:  Yeah, and put your kids in danger.
R:  "-- and let your kids suck it up?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my wife, she's never smoked.  Well, she's smoked but she didn't ever let me smoke in the house.  But she smoked when she was a teenager and did her thing, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, I never smoked in the house with my kids and never got it into their -- their face and even when -- before they were born I never smoked in the house and respected that about her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like how can you sit and -- for somebody that doesn't like it say, "Nah, don't worry about it, it's no big deal".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I can go out of both sides of my mouth too as -- where people have the right to do it, they're old enough to do it and they should be able to do what they wanna do no matter where they are, except in a small space, like you said --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and smoking in front of kids, you know, it's -- it's not the right thing so.
L:  It's like -- yeah, it's like there's a time and place to do everything and, you know --
R:  Well, the kids can't -- the kids can't get out of the -- out of the car.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and they can't -- they can't remove themselves from that situation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like having an alcoholic parent, you can't remove from -- from that situation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean they're stuck there no matter what.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you can't sort of say, "Well, they'll be okay".  
L:  Mhm.
R:  No, they can't remove themselves from the situation so don't put them in the situation to -- to make it bad for 'em, you know, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if you're an adult old enough to know that you can remove yourself from that situation, you know what, then there's a little more understanding.  But, you know, it's -- it's kind of a -- kind of a -- it's a two way street -- uh, not two way street but, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a goofed up street sometimes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause you find people that can't remove themselves from that area and they try and -- so, it's kinda -- I don't know, I guess --
L:  Yeah, it's like I don't feel like not just hanging out with my friends when they smoke 'cause I still want to hang out with them I just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] don't want -- don't like the smoking part, that's all.
R:  Exactly, you know, and that's -- that's understandable.  I mean, er, you have that right not to be subjected to that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then, on the other hand, they have the right to do what they want and it's kinda just a, you know --
L:  Weird situation.
R:  A g- -- a lose lose situation is what it comes out to be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, y- you're losing because your friends want their thing and you're losing because you want your thing and -- and they're giving you hell about it and you're giving them hell, it's like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- where -- where does -- where's the compromise, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, do you compromise to let them smoke or do they compromise to let you not have them smoke, you know, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of a -- kind of a weird situation to try to put yourself into.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- you wanna make them happy and they wanna make you happy but who's making who happy doing what, you know, it's --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, they're really --
R:  And one --
L:  -- I don't see how there's a compromise for that because either it goes -- you know, one or the other it -- it's not like you can say, "I'll smoke over here" because it'll still, you know, affect you.
R:  Right.  Yeah, and either somebody gonna lose and somebody's gonna be pissed off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's either you're gonna be pissed off 'cause they're smoking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you lose because they are smoking or --
L:  Or they're gonna be pissed off because I make them stop or something.
R:  Exactly, but, you know, you not -- to me it'd be so much easier to just say, "Well, okay, I can wait till we're out of the car or somewhere else and I'll go to this side and I'll smoke, you know, at this side of the bar while you go over here to do whatever you wanna do" and it seems like an easy thing but I even had people that were so adamant against non smoking places that they would -- they've gone there for years and the people banned smoking in the restaurants and they refused to go there anymore because they couldn't have one cigarette in a one hour time.  It's like ...
