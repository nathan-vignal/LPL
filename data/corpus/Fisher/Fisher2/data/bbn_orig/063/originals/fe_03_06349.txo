R:  Hi, my name's Ed.
L:  Jessica.
R:  Hi, Jessica, how are you doing today?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Good.  So, [COUGH] what do you think about sm- -- ah, let's see, what was that thing again?  The first one was, um ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  About smoking.
R:  Public smoking.  Smoking in public places, how they banned it.
L:  [NOISE]  Um ...
R:  What's your -- what's your opinion on that?
L:  I don't think they should.  I --
R:  Oh really?  Are you a smoker?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  My opinion is, I'm glad they did, 'cause I'm not a smoker.  And -- oh wait, what state are you in?
L:  Ohio.
R:  I'm in California.  Have they -- have they banned that yet --
L:  No.
R:  -- in Ohio?
L:  No.
R:  California, they banned it a few years back.  They banned, uh, public s- -- you know, smoking in public places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I'm actually personally glad about that.  Have you, uh, have you like, um, is it something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you just do and you're not worried about quitting or anything?  Or have you tried to quit, or like, what -- what's your situation?
L:  Uh, I want to quit.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Mhm.
R:  How many packs do you smoke in a day?
L:  Oh, less than one.
R:  Oh really?  That's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's --
L:  I'm maybe like, half a pack.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah, I don't smoke too much.
R:  I have a friend of mine who's -- who used to smoke three and now he's down to one, so he's -- she's making some progress.
L:  Wow.  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, I never got into smoking, so ...  I mean, I've smoked cigars here and there but I don't really -- was like a really big cigarette smoker or anything like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What you think about those -- like, they said -- they mentioned, uh, help lines or, um, commercials and ads and th- things about -- do those things help people, um, stop smoking, in your opinion?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I don't think it does but, I mean, I guess it's something to think about.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I don't -- I don't think it help -- makes people quit smoking 'cause I see 'em all the time, and I still smoke!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I think if pe- -- someone -- I think it really comes down -- in my opinion I think it comes down to the individual, if they really wanna stop, they'll find a way to stop.  If they really, really want to.  I mean, there's a lot of different avenues.  I mean, I -- I think, um, what -- what's available now, uh, to people who wanna quit smoking, I think if someone puts their mind to it and they have available these different avenues to -- to quit, I think that it's possible.  What do you think?  It is just so addictive that maybe some people can't quit?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I think it, I mean, it -- it's up to the person.
R:  Right.
L:  If they really, really wanna do it.  I mean, it takes a lot of willpower to do it.
R:  Well, um, have you eve smoked more than just a half a pack a day?  Like --
L:  Prob- -- maybe once, when I was drinking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When you drink you -- when you get drunk you tend to smoke more.
R:  No, know, I've had -- I've had girlfriends too, like, they never smoke except like, if we'll go out for a few drinks they'll start smoking.  They told me they just -- it's fun, they just -- so, you know, it's just -- it's just, uh, attitude, like, you know, it adds to the whatever, the feeling --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the fun, whatever.  And I can understand that.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, just when you -- you drink and -- but I -- I mean, [MN] lately I've just been smoking more, I think it's more stress than, you know, just an oral fixation --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, you have to have something there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially when, you know, you -- your b- nerves are bad, but [MN] I admit, there's ways, um, that you can quit smoking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, um, they have, um, I forget what that's called, they stick a pin in your ear and you keep it in for like, two days.
R:  Oh, is that called, um, ocu- acupuncture?
L:  Yeah, acupuncture.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm, I heard that -- I heard that really works.
R:  Hm.
L:  That's like, a hundred and fifty bucks.
R:  Hm.
L:  But [COUGH], I mean, I could save up for it, but [NOISE] --
R:  And that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- supposed to like, cut you out from ever smoking again?
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  A hundred and fifty bu- -- I think that's pretty much worth it! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, I [several inaudible words] you smoke, but, you know, just going to that point where you're, "Okay, I'm not gonna smoke anymore" and ... especially when you're like, it's hectic, you know, you're just -- smoking makes you feel better.  But, uh, no, I do wanna quit, 'cause I have been smoking more than I want to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't --
R:  Well you know, um, [LIPSMACK] -- oh, go, I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  Um, in my opin- -- in my -- in my own situation, I used to like -- I'm in my thirties now, but I used to be a real heavy drinker in my twenties, I mean, party hard, I mean, drink a lot during the day and stuff.  And, um, I have gradually cut down to where it's like, normal, like, where just a couple of beers a day instead of drinking like, fifteen or twenty beers a day like some guys do, 'cause I used to work construction a lot and stuff like that, we'd be drinking all day after -- from lunch until the day was over.  But, um, it was hard for me, it was really hard, because I noticed that like, when I quit drinking [NOISE], um, that it took me so long, months and months and months, to like, feel normal.  I mean -- I mean, I was like so nervous and anxious in the mornings when I'd wake up and stuff, and [SIGH] but I just told myself, like, if I kept on doing that it was just gonna -- it was gonna eventually -- I [inaudible] live a short life, you know?  So, um, I just totally -- one day I just made up my mind, okay, I'm just gonna try the drink socially, normally and -- and, um, and it -- man, I screwed up so many times, I mean, I'd go on binges and stuff here and there, but like, just within the last couple of years I've been like, pretty good about it.  I haven't been like, too destructive with it.  Um --
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's really good.  It's just -- it's just so hard.  [LAUGH]  So hard to quit.
R:  It is hard, because I mean, who wants to cut out something that gives 'em pleasure?  You know?  What wan- -- I mean, that's -- that -- it's not what -- as human beings we're all looking for what makes us feel good, you know?  I mean, that makes sense that we wanna stick with something that makes us feel good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if it -- but the thing is, is, trying to maybe -- I think maybe trying to replace a little bit of the time things that are good for you that make you feel good, rather than things that are bad that -- that destroy your body, um, and make you feel good for a short t- +term -- short term period.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which it's just like smoking and drinking, you know.  But [SIGH] I think anything in moderation is fine.  I mean, to me, I -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] if you're smoking really just a half a pack a day, I think that's pretty good, I mean, but, you know, maybe you can cut it down to a quarter pack, and that's fine, but, um, I mean, I -- I don't think smoking's wrong, I mean, or bad -- too bad for you, if you just keep it to -- keep it to the -- to the least amount that you can get away -- you know, get away with.  Like, just don't do it just for an excuse, do it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if you really need it 'cause you're nervous or something, I mean, go ahead and do it, but not -- I would say, try not to do it if, um, if you just -- 'cause you're -- you're bored or you don't have anything to do, you know, I'd -- I -- I would think.  That's how I did it with the drinking.  I would like -- I would do drinking, 'cause like, if I had a whole day off and I had nothing to do and I'd just -- nothing, and I'd just be sitting in front of the TV and just drinking vodka cranberries all day long, you know, just 'cause I was bored.  And I was like -- where I started was those kinds of days where I'd go, "Well, shit, I'm gonna get outside and I'm gonna go like, go to the beach or I'm gonna walk around or something.  Go [MN] look at artwork or something in a museum or something, instead of just sitting there getting fat and drinking and getting f- messed up and [LAUGH] --"
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I -- I [COUGH] -- but I -- I definitely -- I'm considering it, you know?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's something I wanna do.
R:  Well, you know, that acupuncture things star- sounds really good, because have you ever figured out how much you spend on cigarettes in a year or something?  Have you ever sat down and figured that out?
L:  Oh [COUGH] [inaudible] --
R:  Or in a week even.
L:  Me and my boyfriend figured it out.  It was like, uh, a thousand dollars.
R:  In a year?
L:  I think over a month, or maybe two months.
R:  In a -- a -- a thousand dollars in a month.
L:  Maybe a month or two months.  I think it's that.  I'm figured -- we figured it out, 'cause --
R:  Holy moly, that's a lot.
L:  [COUGH] 'Cause we, um, well he w- -- he tried to quit when I was pregnant, 'cause I quit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, he figured it out.  I think it was a thousand something dollars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm gonna say.  But I don't think it was a month, I don't think we spent that much.  We spend --
R:  Yeah, I don't think it's a month.  It -- it sounds like maybe -- well, what do -- what do they go for now, like a pack nowadays?  Is it like, four bucks or something?
L:  Oh, in Ohio it's like, three.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Three bucks a pack and w- -- and so you, what do you use, about, uh, how mu- -- does your, um, does your -- if you don't mind me asking, does your boyfriend smoke more than half a pack a day?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  No, he smokes about the same amount I do.
R:  Okay, so you guys probably share about a pack a day then, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that's about -- that's like, three bucks a day times seven days in a week, that's twenty one bucks.  So I say, figure, twenty bucks a week times four, that's, uh, eighty bucks a week -- I'm sorry, a month.  Eighty bucks a month.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then times ten would be eight hundred.  And then times twelve would be eight hundred and -- nine hundred and [NOISE] -- nine hundred and sixty dollars.  So you're spending about -- yeah, about -- that's about a year.  You're spending about a thousand bucks a year on cigarettes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually, that's not too bad really, I mean ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's not too bad, but, you know, you'd -- you'd put it look -- if you look at it like this, you put a thousand bucks in the bank over ten years, it's like -- it's not ten thousand, it's like, twenty five thousand dollars or thirty thousand, or -- or forty or fifty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thousand dollars.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  Actually, ten years, a thousand dollars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- saved for ten years, I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- comes out to be over [MN] probably something crazy like sixty, seventy thousand dollars after -- after interest and stuff like that, if you put it in something like a -- like a mutual fund or a CD, probably a mutual fund.  If you put it in a mutual fund --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you guys would be like, you could have retirement money.  In ten or twenty years you guys could probably have a few hundred thousand dollars saved.
L:  That'd be nice!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, at the end of twenty years, saving a thousand bucks a year for -- for ten years, um, for twenty years.  I think -- I looked into some mutual fund things and they're like, um, they break it down for you, to where if you save a certain amount of money every month or every year for like, say, fifteen or twenty years, you're supposed to have -- be able to cash out with a couple of hundred grand or something like that, but I forgot the exact -- the exact numbers.  But, um ... it's so funny, how like, if you save just a little bit of money, how much it totally grows over such an, um, a little bit of money grows so much so fast.  'Cause, see, my thing is, I play the lottery over here.  Like, I play it -- I don't play a lot, I just play it like, we have -- it's on Wednesday's and Saturdays and I play two -- two -- two number -- two, um, lines.  Two like, you know, two different number -- two num- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- numb- -- different groups of numbers every --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every Wednesday and every Saturday.  So it's four -- well, it's only four bucks a week.  But I
