R:  Hello, this is Miles.
L:  My name's Diane.
R:  What is it?
L:  Diane.
R:  Diane.  So, Diane, do you smoke?
L:  Uh, no.
R:  No.  [LIPSMACK]  Um ... I do.
L:  Okay.
R:  How do you feel about that?  [LAUGH]
L:  How do I feel about you smoking?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it's your own choice.  It's -- I feel like that's up to you, I don't -- I'm not gonna treat you any differently from what you choose to do.
R:  I see.  How old are you, Diane?
L:  I am twenty n- -- oh no, thirty.
R:  You're twenty, you're thirty?
L:  I'm thirty.
R:  You're --
L:  I was going to say twenty nine, but I just turned thirty.
R:  I see.  Where are you from?
L:  From Pullman, Washington.  [PAUSE]
R:  Which Washington?
L:  Pullman, Washington.
R:  Pullman.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I'm from Chicago.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  That's in Illinois.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Some people like to pronounce it Illinoise, but they're incorrect.
L:  Oh, would they?  Yeah, some people like to call Washington, Warshington, they put an R. in there.
R:  Mm.  That's sort of a midwestern accent, uh, if you -- if you use an R. in there.  Or at least, uh, I think it is.
L:  Oh, is it?  Oh, I don't know.
R:  Or is it maybe -- or is it maybe a northwest thing as well?  Could be.
L:  I have no idea.  I've heard -- I've heard it -- I don't -- I don't know, I've never made that, um, distinction between who's calling it that.  I've never asked where they're from or whatever.  But I do hear that sometimes.  Are you -- how does -- are you taking part in the survey too, or ...?
R:  I'm conducting the survey.
L:  You're doing it, got it.
R:  No, no, no, no, I'm the same as you.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I just felt, uh, that we needed to talk [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- so I started asking questions.
L:  Cool.
R:  Um ...  So what is your date of bir- -- no, I'm kidding.
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, I think we're supposed to talk about smoking but, uh, the -- the last pers- --
L:  Is that how it works, that -- that you just ... strike up -- I have never done this before.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I did it a -- a few minutes ago.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  And the woman I spoke to stayed very much on the topic.
L:  Oh, got it.
R:  [LAUGH]  Not that I -- I tried to -- I tried to take it out, myself --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I figure they don't really care about the topic, they're just, um ...
L:  Seeing how people talk on the phone.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's a linguistic study.
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've got it.
R:  But, I don't know.
L:  I don't either.  I'm a non smoker.  Uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but my father smokes and so, I mean, it --
R:  I bet that annoys you.
L:  It's one of those things that -- no, it doesn't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- annoy me, I just -- you know, of course I want him to quit because I want him to -- I know it's -- it's much better for him, for his health, if he does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, it's -- like I said, I don't treat him any differently.  I don't harass him.  Um, but as far as in public places, I am of the mindset that I wouldn't mind it being banned because of the studies of secondhand smoke, and the, um dangers that can come to other people because of the smoke.  And so I --
R:  You're in Los Angeles?
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  Are you in --
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Are you in Los Angeles?
L:  No.  [inaudible].
R:  No, so you're in Washington.
L:  Washington, yeah.
R:  Ah.
L:  Pullman, Washington.  It's east -- eastern Washington.  Hm.
R:  So it's, um -- where -- where is -- where do laws stand there, in terms of public places?
L:  It's -- we have a lot of universities in our area and it's all ... um, so it can be a pretty -- I don't know if I want to use the word intellectual or -- area -- politically correct [SIGH] is a more, um, a term that I guess could describe it.  So it's -- there's no restaurant that it's allowed in, so it's pretty much banned in public places around here.
R:  But wouldn't that be a state law, or not, or, you know?
L:  Um, I --
R:  You're not sure?
L:  I don't know if it is a state law or not, I -- I don't know.
R:  Mm.
L:  I can't --
R:  Uh, like in a bar, can you smoke in bars, or ...?
L:  I would -- it's my guess -- I don't know, I never go to bars, so I have no idea what --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- what they do.  I'm just thinking, you know, all I know is from the areas that I frequent, you know, so I know, you know, I rec- -- you know, see the signs and, you know, this is a no smoking area, and they designate -- there n- areas outside where it's allowed.  So ...
R:  Is it -- is -- what i- -- what is the university that's in that -- that town?
L:  Washington State University.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then just eight miles away is Moscow[?], Idaho, and the University of Idaho is there.  So we've got two universities just right -- eight miles apart, two cities that are real close.
R:  Oh yeah, I have a friend who went to -- to Washington State.
L:  Oh really?  Mhm.  What do you think about it?  Do you think that it should be banned?  'Cause I think that you probably have a different opinion, being a smoker yourself, as far as --
R:  Oh, well here it is banned and, uh, you know, state wide, it's a law, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's very clear.  Um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No smoking in -- in bars or restaurants, and, uh, [LIPSMACK] it's, um, the -- and a -- it's -- it's changed my life, for the worse, [LAUGH] basically, because I smoke a lot, I'm not comfortable if I can't smoke.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, [LIPSMACK] so -- so going to restaurants or bars, you know, or anywhere, is -- is, you know, is, uh, is a chore, whereas it should be, uh, a pleasure.
L:  Uh-huh.  So do you think there should be maybe some restaurants where it is allowed, and then people can choose to go there if they want to or not, if they don't smoke.  You know, if -- if they don't smoke and they want to be in that kind of --
R:  Well, it seemed -- it seemed fine when there was, um, you know, smoking sections and non smoking sections, and, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think it's gonna change ... in California.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think it'll go back.
R:  No.  So, I'm more inclined to think I should quit.  [LAUGH]
L:  I was just gonna say, "Why don't you just quit?"  Which -- that's very easy for me to say because I don't have that, I know it's a difficult habit to -- to break.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it's something that's that difficult and you feel like you can't go anywhere, if that's changing your lifestyle that much then -- but I think -- I don't know, I -- it's -- it's one of those things, you know, like I was saying, with the secondhand smoke, if they're saying that the harm that it's causing other people, then, you know, then that raises my feelings against it even more, because if you're gonna do something that's detrimental to yourself, fine, do it, you know.  But if what you're doing is affecting people around you within a, you know, pretty significant dis- distance, I don't know specifically what the -- you know, how far away or how close do they need to be to be affected by secondhand smoke, but I know the studies they've done are pretty extensive, and that it's -- that it's basically confirmed that it is detrimental to other people, which is -- when, you know, like I said, was it's causing trouble to others, then that's where your rights and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know if rights is the word.  Do you know what I mean?
R:  I know.  Smokers have no rights.
L:  Huh?
R:  A- as it is, smokers have no rights, but it's a --
L:  Yeah, you have the right to smoke.
R:  Nowhere.
L:  So, you have the right to smoke outside.
R:  That's horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We ma- -- it makes us feel ostracized.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like lepers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, [MN] which is understandable.
R:  Well that's no good.
L:  But if you're choosing to smoke ... so you're choo- -- it's not like you're doing -- it's not like you're black or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that you're from another -- you know what I mean?  It's not like you're something that you have no control over, you know what I'm saying?  Like people -- I'm -- I'm -- I am against --
R:  Well, I happen to be black.
L:  -- discrimination.  I'm against discrimination.  Do you know what I mean?  I'm not saying that I am completely against that, I'm saying --
R:  Why do you assume that I'm not black, because I am black?
L:  Great, I'm not assuming you're not black, I'm just saying --
R:  You did, you said -- you said, uh, "It's not like you're black or anything".
L:  Okay.  Well, what I'm trying -- I'm sorry, what I'm trying to say is, "It's not like you have -- you have a condition, or like, if people who have something that they have no control over, that if people are just, you know, if you're saying you're ostracized and treated as a leper --"
R:  So y- -- but you assume -- you assume that -- that any person is black, would choose to be white if they could?
L:  No, I am not saying --
R:  Yeah, that is what you -- that's what that implies.
L:  Okay, well then I'm -- I'm -- then I'm --
R:  That's -- that's -- that's what's -- that's what's swimming around in -- in your -- in the back of your mind.
L:  No it's not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would not -- I am not even implying that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'm not --
R:  That's been implied.  That's been implied.
L:  Okay, I apologize then, that's my in- -- that's not what I was meaning to imply.  What I'm saying in regards to the smoking issue is that if it -- this situation where you have no control, like when -- if it was, um
