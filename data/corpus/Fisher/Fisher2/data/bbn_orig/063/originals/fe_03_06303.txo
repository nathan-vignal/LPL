R:  Hi, my name is Barb Manley[?].
L:  Hi, this is Karen. [NOISE] --
R:  How are --
L:  [inaudible] and I'm from Michigan. [NOISE]
R:  I'm from New York.
L:  Ah, I hear your first name was Barb?
R:  Yes, my name is Barb.
L:  Okay.  All right. [NOISE] I guess the topic of the day they gave us was [NOISE] smoking and how do you feel about it in public places.
R:  Correct. [NOISE] Correct.  Um, [SIGH] and as far as, ah, quitting smoking hotlines and support groups, you know, I think that's a really good idea for anyone that has been a smoker.  Um, how do you feel about the smoking laws?
L:  Um, I -- I feel bad for the people that are addicted to smoking and not being able to go in a public place, um, I think it's good to have a separated sections though.
R:  Right.
L:  But I wish sometimes -- I have asthma and as a cigarette's smoked [several inaudible words] sometimes I wished it would be like separate rooms --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because before we've been seated at a, um, non smoking table but right over in a wall --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] so many smoking in there --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and then you feel bad for the people to have to get up and move when -- you know, when you have to ask for a different table or something.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Well, here in New York as of July there'll be no smoking anywhere that's a public place --
L:  Really?  Wow.
R:  -- not in bars or anything and in the county that I was in [SIGH] -- that I live in, they had made the law like three years ago that in order to be able to smoke in an establishment such as a restaurant they had to have a separate room.  But now it's no smoking anywhere in bars or anything like that.  I mean, I don't know if you heard about -- it already went into effect in New York city but it's throughout New York state, the end of July.  But there was a bar tender that was killed in New York city over arguing with a gentleman ab- about the fact -- whether he could smoke or not.
L:  Wow.  Well, I didn't hear about that.
R:  And -- yeah.  Yeah, so I don't know -- I don't know how I feel about them banning smoking in bars, I personally -- I don't go to bars --
L:  Mhm.  Me either.
R:  -- but you know -- I don't know, it seems like it will cause more problems with people [LAUGH] that do go to bars and drink and want to smoke and then have to go outside and do it.  I think it's just going cause chaos --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?
L:  And I know some of the employers in our area -- my husband works for a large company called Steelcase --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- big office furniture company and they have banned smoking even on the company premises.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  So, during their break time the workers have to go and get their car or whatever [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and leave the company premises to go have a smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  That's kind of crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  It is.
R:  But you know as far -- I mean, I think if peop- -- if smokers want to smoke they should be able to smoke outside and I honestly believe -- I'm in Rochester and this is where Kodak is and I swear the smoke and the pollution that Kodak makes every day is worse than the second hand smoke of people that are going outside to smoke, but [SIGH] um ...
L:  Uh-huh.  And then, um, I think too insurance companies should have to -- the people that are smoking to pay for people to stop beca- --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- essentially would save them money on the premiums because --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- there's probably a lot of health --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- risks involved, I'm sure, with smoking and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- I think if -- maybe if people -- if money wasn't an issue and they could sign up for a program maybe that --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- would help too [inaudible] -- just some kind of assistance like that.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I don't know how much programs cost but --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- they must be quite a bit.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But some- -- there's a couple of restaurants in our neighborhood that have banned smoking, but not very many.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Not like a -- a law but I'm sure other states have that rule.
R:  It will be someday. [LAUGH] I'm sure.
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  You know?
L:  Mm.  Well ...
R:  Ah, do we have any other thoughts on [SIGH] -- um, what else did they say the topic was?  Smoking and h- help groups and -- I'm trying to think. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  I think it was help groups and how you feel about --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- smoking in public places.
R:  Right.
L:  I think it was that.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But -- hm, I don't know how the [several inaudible words] I know my father in law smokes and it's really addictive.  He tried to quit smoking and it's a bad thing.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, I smoked prior to having children and when I would -- when I quit smoking I -- I could have like killed somebody for a cigarette [LAUGH] and I'm a very calm person, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- once I became pregnant, you know, then there's no choice and you have to do it, but it's very hard dealing with people that do smoke.  [several inaudible words] my oldest daughter is asthmatic and we don't even go to my in laws' home because of the fact that they smoke.  And even if they try to refrain from smoking their house still smells --
L:  Of the smoke.
R:  -- of the smoke and it still affects her and that --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- that's really hard because when she was little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you couldn't even -- you know, holidays were -- made me incredibly nervous because you would have to go there and you'd be like, "Oh, please don't let her have an asthma attack" --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, " don't want her to have to go to the hospital on Christmas" --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  You know?  But --
L:  Because my father, he goes outside to smoke so --
R:  Uh-huh.  That's nice. [SIGH]
L:  -- it doesn't smell in their house or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like that.  She doesn't allow him [LAUGH] to smoke in the house. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  That's a good thing though. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But I do wish there was more restaurants that would have just a separate rooms and I'd be happy with that rather than --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you don't have to be in a [NOISE] -- entirely -- if it has a bar or something like that.
R:  Exactly.  Exac- -- and I think that's my big thing, that I think if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if it's in a bar setting [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess I think that people should be able to smoke, just because if that's the setting you're choosing to put yourself in. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- it seemed like too, the businesses are going to lose money [NOISE] too if their customers ...
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  So, do you have little ones? [LAUGH]
L:  I do, I've got a -- a four year old and a two year.
R:  Oh.
L:  They're twenty one months apart. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, I have a six, seven and eight year old.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I had all three of them in twenty six months. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my.  You were really busy.
R:  Really, really busy.
L:  Because sometimes I don't --
R:  But it's wonderful now.
L:  -- how I did everything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Keeps me busy.
R:  The last two were only ten months apart --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my!
R:  -- because the -- my last one came early and, ah --
L:  Must have been so tired trying to --
R:  Oh, my gosh.  Not now! [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's massive.  [several inaudible words] I don't know how you did it. [NOISE]
R:  Now it's wonderful because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're going to be seven, eight and nine this summer and it's just -- it's nice because they have fun [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, they -- they always have each other, so.
L:  I've got a boy and a girl, so they're -- they're pals --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they play really good together, because they're close in age --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and people think I have a set of twins because they're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she only weighs a half a pound different [several inaudible words] --
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  He's all boy! [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Well, my -- my two youngest are boy- -- I have a girl an- and two boys and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] -- and, ah, they, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody always thinks they're twins because there's just -- you know, w- with only being ten months apart they're so -- so much alike and they're like, "We're not twins! --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- We're different" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like, "You are different, boys" [LAUGH] "Don't worry about it".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ...  I [inaudible] --
L:  Have you done your three calls so far?  [several inaudible words] --
R:  No, this is my first one. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Well, this is -- this is my first one too.
R:  Oh.
L:  I was approved for three and I signed up.  I saw it on the internet --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  [NOISE] -- through one of the -- there's a little coupon club that I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- prescribe to. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [several inaudible words] that they were --
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  So, it's kind of nice.
R:  [SIGH] So, how much longer do we have left? [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] keep track of the time.  I think they come on -- somebody told me they come on and say, "You have thirty seconds left" or something.
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  There's some kind of announcement, but that it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like shortly after that I guess they cut you off.  It doesn't seem like thirty seconds --
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay, I haven't known anybody that did this.  I got it off a mystery shopping port[?].  I do mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  So ... Do you like to do it?
L:  I do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It works out good too, with my schedule and --
R:  Oh, yeah.

R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I can go out and do a --
R:  Exactly.
L:  [several inaudible words] shop for, ah, Shop And Check and [inaudible] --
R:  Uh-huh.  Shop And Check is who I shop for too. [LAUGH]
L:  Really? [LAUGH] That's neat. [LAUGH]
R:  How funny.
L:  They pay really good, so.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Don't have any problems and -- and then I just got accepted at [inaudible] I just -- I'm supposed to do a shop for that, so it's brand new.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Another one is C.R.I.  Have you ever worked for them?
L:  Um, do they do merchandising, no?
R:  No.  Basically for them I go to movie theatres and count seats --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- and it's so easy. [LAUGH]
L:  That would be easy.
R:  And it's not mystery actually.  It's -- um, you go in with a letter and then the other thing you do is you -- sometimes you go count CDs and you know -- let me tell you the name exactly so you can contact them because -- they're -- and they pay quickly and they're nice.
L:  Well, that's good, because a lot --

R:  [LAUGH] E- exactly.
L:  [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
