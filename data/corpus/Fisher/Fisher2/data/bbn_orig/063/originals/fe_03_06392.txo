R:  Hi, this is Sharon from Maryland.
L:  Yes --
R:  Hello?
L:  -- how are ya?
R:  Okay, how are you?
L:  Good, uh, where are you?
R:  I'm in Maryland.
L:  Oh, that's good. [NOISE]
R:  Um, my name is Sharon.  Your name?
L:  My name is Leigh[?].
R:  Very good.  Where are you at?
L:  Um, [NOISE] New York.  Queens, New York.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, so what do you think --
L:  What part of -- yeah, what -- what do you think about the terrorist attack?
R:  Um, well, I just think that I just see most people panicking. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty much, you know, what I witnessed on nine eleven and, um, you know, at -- at first hand I know from my own personal experience it seems like when something happens of that proportion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, people don't know what to do.  You know --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- because the instinct is to run.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, we are, um -- I actually live about twenty five miles away from Washington, DC --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my hus- -- and my husband's a DC police officer.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So that is a very big concern, to a certain degree, because especially on, like, nine eleven --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I could not contact him, you know --
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  -- because he was busy doing other things, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  What i- -- what is your take on it?
L:  Um, this is, um ... I think this is very unpredictable.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, I -- also I found out that life is pretty fragile and, um, [inaudible] nine eleven, although I'm in New York I didn't see my eyes but I read a lotta article news about it.  I feel sorry for those people and, um, ah, I just can't believe these, um, terrorists would do such a thing like that.  But the one thing is, uh, [SIGH] ah, yes, uh, I remember the one time during the evacuation, the time the ... the gua- -- the guard downstairs telling the people going back up to work again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A- and, ah, I think the work is important but when there's this, uh, kinda, uh ... terrorist thing happens, I think the life's more important than the -- the work.
R:  Oh, definitely. [LAUGH] Definitely.  I think that the people who went back to work, you know -- you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I guess they thought, "Oh, it's just, like, another fire drill" or, you know ...
L:  Right, right.
R:  Unfortunately, you know, they were told that, you know, um ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think my instinct would to be get out at any cost, and a good thing a l- -- a lot of people did.  I mean, I was very surprised that more people weren't killed.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I really thought that more would be, just sort of, you know, the sheer numbers.  A-, um, but a lot of people did -- were -- managed to get out, and -- and that was good, but, um ...
L:  Right now --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I think -- I -- I personally think right now the whole nation should -- everybody alert, uh, to -- if you see any horrible thing or terrorist thing, the suspicious thing, should report right away.  And --
R:  Yes, w- we have -- I know on this one highway here, they have, like, the highway sign that goes across.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it says, "H- here's the phone number to report suspicious terrorist activity".
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And it gives a phone number, you know, because -- I guess because we're between Washington, DC and Baltimore --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which are two, I guess bigger cities.  Um, I don't -- you know, then again I wouldn't know if -- you know, [inaudible] I wal- -- literally walked into it but, you know, I walked into the grocery store and it was being bombed by a car bomb or something, you know, who kno- -- you know.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  That would be really strange. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Also I think the, uh, the Immi- -- the Immigration Department should really look up and look out who's, uh, gonna come over here.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, uh, what +purpose they're coming to this country.  We really don't need these kind of people coming to --
R:  No.
L:  -- this country and doing these such terrible things.
R:  Well, in a -- it's hard to tell but I think to a certain degree I think you're right where the immigration needs to know.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, a lot of these people Immigration has been watching, and some of them had already extended their visas.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And should have already been deported or out of the country, so --
L:  Yeah, I thought they should watch, uh, watch for the student visa.  Some -- some [inaudible] come over here, they get a student visa but they -- they never report to the school.
R:  Right, exactly.  And -- and, um --
L:  And [inaudible] Immigration Department, they really had a ... I think they really should do their job, uh, better.
R:  Well, that -- that's, you know ... the problem with -- unfortunately, I guess, you know, we can't close our borders, and they're not willing to do that, for a certain period of time, you know, even just to, you know, weed out what we got here [LAUGH] you know, they'll find terrorists out here and terrorists out there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, [MN] you know, being -- America has always been so open to letting just anyone come through.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, you know, that's what I guess to a certain degree what we've been built on, but it's hard when you know that, like you said, some of these people are coming on student visas, you know ...
L:  Mm.
R:  It's hard to believe th- -- some of these are, you know, thirty, thirty five y- year old people, usually, you know, like you said, are not necessarily checking into a school. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [inaudible] watch [several inaudible words] some of the ... I think some of the country people, [several inaudible words] watch, uh, [several inaudible words] on the Middle- -- Mid East, those countries.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah ...
R:  May I ask what nationality you are?
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  Oh, very -- very good.  Okay.
L:  Um ... [several inaudible words]
R:  Um, are you national?
L:  Yeah, I'm naturalized.
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  But, uh ... I visited my, uh, [several inaudible words] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] country [several inaudible words] years ago [inaudible] I was, uh, [several inaudible words] United States.  And, uh, I never [several inaudible words] because I think, uh, [several inaudible words] naturalized, I was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] myself and, uh ...
R:  But did people treat you any different because, you know ...
L:  Uh, no.
R:  ... they think, "Well, you're not necessarily not h-" -- you know what I mean?  That it -- you're not American but ...
L:  Well, I don't -- I don't, uh ... uh, no.  But some people --
R:  I just detect an accent, that's why, I guess, some people might jump to the conclusion, "Oh, she is" -- you know what I mean?
L:  Yes.  Ah, well, some -- once in a while, people, they [several inaudible words] harassment and, uh, I would tell them, ah, when I [inaudible] ... when I am in Arizona they may [several inaudible words] same thing.
R:  Very good.  Okay.
L:  Don't you agree?
R:  Y- -- oh, oh, definitely, a hundred percent.  Um, you know, that's why you gotta take each person and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and judge 'em on their own merits and that's what makes it hard.  It's like, well, you're supposed to look for a terrorist.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, well, what does one look like?  Well, are they --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- [inaudible] at least they're in [inaudible] are they, you know, from Afr- -- who knows, you know?  Yes, a lot of them are from Iraq, Iran ... you know.
L:  Well, [several inaudible words] you know who are the terrorists and sometimes, uh, some terrorists [inaudible] the ... then the -- our -- our own people such the Oklahoma --
R:  Exactly.  Look at -- yeah, at Oklahoma City.  I mean, that's ... was, you know, blond hair, blue eyed guy, you know.
L:  Mhm, but, uh --
R:  So --
L:  -- I think, uh --
R:  You never know what evil is in somebody's heart, you know, you --
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  [several inaudible words] all over the corner.  I thought that was really good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [inaudible] used to be [inaudible] take subway, and [several inaudible words] the blind spot [several inaudible words] feel pretty safe.  [several inaudible words] because there's so many [inaudible].
R:  Right, right.
L:  And, uh, [several inaudible words] --
R:  Ha- -- well, ha- have you gone to places where there are, say, large amounts of people?  Like, we went to Seaworld last month, you know.  My husband was kind of leery about going to a place where large amounts of people gather.
L:  Yeah, right, right, yeah.
R:  You know, um --
L:  I know.
R:  Be- -- for being soft target, you know, that's what --
L:  Right.
R:  If a terrorist is going to -- they wanna make sure they take out the most people, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the World Trade Center was -- you know, there's a lot of people there, obviously, or, um --
L:  Right.
R:  Our mothers' group was supposed to make a trip to the Baltimore Zoo, like, the week after, um, nine eleven, which we canceled because, you know, you didn't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if someone would drive through, you know, the elephant house with the big, you know --
L:  I also, I -- I --
R:  -- [inaudible].
L:  -- I really -- I really think they should, uh, do something about the Canada border.
R:  Yeah.  Well, definitely, because that's apparently a little too easy to get across.
L:  Yeah, that's -- a lot of those, uh, terrorists, they came from Canada, that border there.
R:  Y- -- I mean, I have never been to the Canada border, so I don't know how hard or how easy it is to get across of it, um --
L:  Uh, pretty easy --
R:  -- just what I've heard.  Is it?
L:  -- [inaudible].  Pretty easy and -- and especially, like, uh, Niagara Fall area, they've got --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] there.  I used to live in Vermont, close to the Canada border there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, [inaudible] I read in some newspaper that it was the terrorists -- they all came from the Canada border there.
R:  Hm.  So, um, you kn- -- we have, you know, i- -- the Canada border, the Mexico border ... well, of course, Canada we, you know -- that extends all the way to -- I mean, I know it's, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- right there at Niagara Falls, but I don't know how easy it is to get across, all the way across, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  But anyway they need a more -- uh, when those people carry Canadia- -- pa- -- uh, the visa and then come to the United States, if they really had to, uh, get --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- some more kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh ... if they wanna come to this country I think they need a more -- more, uh, mature about what kind of people they are letting in the United +States, you know, who -- who --
