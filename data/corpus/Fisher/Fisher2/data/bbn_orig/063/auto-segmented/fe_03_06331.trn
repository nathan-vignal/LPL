OH I THINK THEY WANT US TO TALK ABOUT WH- WHETHER WE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA OR NOT AND THEN THEY WANT US TO DISCUSS WHETHER WE FEEL HOTLINES OR UM  (fe_03_06331-A-0009)
I DON'T KNOW EDUCATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL WOULD BE EFFECTIVE  (fe_03_06331-A-0010)
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I GOT OUT OF IT  (fe_03_06331-A-0011)

AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT [MN] YEAH YES YEAH  (fe_03_06331-A-0014)
I THINK SO YEAH YEAH MM  (fe_03_06331-A-0015)
WELL I'M I'M AN EX SMOKER MYSELF I I QUIT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT [NOISE] ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO AND I KNOW IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND I'M NOT SURE IF A HOTLINE  (fe_03_06331-A-0016)
WOULD HAVE HELPED ME OR NOT I DIDN'T USE A HOTLINE I  (fe_03_06331-A-0017)
UM IT JUST ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY MADE ME SICK BECAUSE I AND I WAS PREGNANT SO I JUST QUIT  (fe_03_06331-A-0018)
BUT I TRIED TO QUIT EM YOU KNOW A A MILLION TIMES BEFORE THAT [MN] AND UNLESS YOU HAVE THE WILL  (fe_03_06331-A-0019)
THEN I I DON'T THINK ANYTHING WORKS BUT MAYBE EDUCATION WILL AT LEAST STOP PEOPLE FROM EVEN STARTING IN THE FIRST PLACE  (fe_03_06331-A-0020)
YEAH  (fe_03_06331-A-0021)
YEAH IT'S A PRETTY TOUGH THING TO DO BUT MAYBE WITH SUPPORT I'M NOT I LIKE I SAID IT WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED FOR ME BUT MAYBE IT WORKS FOR SOME [MN]  (fe_03_06331-A-0022)

WELL SURE HOTLINES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SMOKING YOU CAN TRY JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD WORK FOR ME DOESN'T MEAN IT DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYBODY EVERYBODY I THINK WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY TO  (fe_03_06331-A-0026)

SO THEY TALK ABOUT DRUGS IN THOSE AGES I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT THE RIGHT AGE TO START INTRODUCING CIGARETTES I MEAN THEY'RE DRUGS TOO OR IN A WAY RIGHT  (fe_03_06331-A-0044)
THAT WAS MY MAIN MOTIVATION AND THEN IT WAS ALSO HELPED ALONG QUITE EASILY BY THE FACT THAT IT MADE MY PHYSICALLY SICK TO SMELL CIGARETTE SMOKE  (fe_03_06331-A-0047)
[NOISE] SO  (fe_03_06331-A-0048)
IT WENT FROM IT WAS GOING TO BE DONE REGARDLESS OF HOW HARD IT WAS BUT IT MADE IT EASY THAT [LAUGHTER] I WAS SICK SO I HAD THE EASIEST QUIT SMOKING PLAN EVER [LAUGHTER] NOT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE THAT ONE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06331-A-0049)

ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW I CAN GET O- I CAN GET THROUGH IT MYSELF BUT UM MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WOULD UTILIZE THAT IN THAT WAY YEAH [MN]  (fe_03_06331-A-0062)

RIGHT HERE THEY'VE DONE RESTAURANTS AS WELL AND A BUT A RESTAURANT HAS A CHOICE OF BEING UM AN ADULT ONLY [NOISE] EIGHTEEN AND OVER  (fe_03_06331-A-0080)
AND IF THEY'RE EIGHTEEN AND OVER THEN THEY CAN ALLOW SMOKING BUT IF THEY'RE A FAMILY RESTAURANT THEY HAVE TO  (fe_03_06331-A-0081)
UM BAN ALL SMOKING [NOISE]  (fe_03_06331-A-0082)

SO YEAH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE  (fe_03_06331-B-0066)
[NOISE] THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO START THE EDUCATION THAT [NOISE] THAT EARLY  (fe_03_06331-B-0067)
[NOISE] SO YOUR MAIN MOTIVATION FOR QUITTING WAS THE FACT THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT [NOISE]  (fe_03_06331-B-0070)
