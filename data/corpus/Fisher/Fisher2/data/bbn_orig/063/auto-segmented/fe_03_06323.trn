YEAH THEY GAVE ME UP FOR DEAD BUT HERE I AM  (fe_03_06323-A-0006)
WELL I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND I DIDN'T GO THROUGH WITHDRAWAL OR ANYTHING BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF IT FOR LIKE THREE WEEKS I  (fe_03_06323-A-0007)

UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE AROUND ME DO  (fe_03_06323-A-0011)

I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF IT ONLY BECAUSE I'M A LIVING EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN  (fe_03_06323-A-0013)
UM PRIOR TO THAT I FELT IT WASN'T THE GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS  (fe_03_06323-A-0014)
AND WELL IT IS THEIR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT'S UP TO THEM TO PROTECT SOCIETY  (fe_03_06323-A-0015)

LIKE LIKE THE SEATBELT ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE  (fe_03_06323-A-0018)
I DON'T THINK IT'S THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE IT  (fe_03_06323-A-0020)
I THINK THE HAVE THE RIGHT TO  (fe_03_06323-A-0021)
RECOMMEND IT AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT UM SOMEBODY'S GETTING A KICKBACK FROM IT  (fe_03_06323-A-0022)
UM  (fe_03_06323-A-0023)
HOWEVER WITH SMOKING PEOPLE SAY WELL I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SMOKE IT'S MY BODY IT'S YOU KNOW BUT  (fe_03_06323-A-0024)
YOU REALLY DON'T IF YOU'RE GONNA INVOLVE OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED WITH THE CIGARETTE SMOKING  (fe_03_06323-A-0025)
AH RIGHT AND WE ALL PAY IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE OF IT  (fe_03_06323-A-0026)
BUT WHAT'S THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE  (fe_03_06323-A-0027)
AND WHICH ONES ARE TH- THE ONES CHOSEN  (fe_03_06323-A-0028)
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING THAT WOULD CAUSE  (fe_03_06323-A-0029)
FRICTION WITH THEM  (fe_03_06323-A-0030)
IT WOULD CAUSE FRICTION WITH THEM THEY WOULD SAY WELL WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON ME AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06323-A-0031)
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THIS  (fe_03_06323-A-0032)
BECAUSE LOOK AT THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE MAKING  (fe_03_06323-A-0033)
BY HAVING PEOPLE SMOKE  (fe_03_06323-A-0034)
TAXES AND EVERYTHING ELSE  (fe_03_06323-A-0035)
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING EXACTLY  (fe_03_06323-A-0036)
YEAH IT TOTALLY SHOCKED ME  (fe_03_06323-A-0037)
BUT I HEARD THAT THEY'RE DID THAT IN CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'VE MADE OUT  (fe_03_06323-A-0038)
THAT YOU COULDN'T SMOKE ANYWHERE  (fe_03_06323-A-0039)
RIGHT WELL THAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE YET IT'S GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE BUT ISN'T YET I AM IN NEW YORK  (fe_03_06323-A-0040)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH UM  (fe_03_06323-A-0041)
THEY HAVE  (fe_03_06323-A-0042)
WELL IT'S NOT INTO EFFECT YET  (fe_03_06323-A-0043)
IT THEY'RE TR- THEY'RE THEY'RE PUTTING IT SOME TIME IN JULY  (fe_03_06323-A-0044)
OH YEAH SOME SOME ARE SAYING YEAH YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES  (fe_03_06323-A-0045)
WELL THE WAY IT'S BEEN HERE IN THE PA- WELL UP UNTIL THEY PASSED THIS WELL UP UNTIL THIS COMES INTO EFFECT IS YOU CAN GO TO CERTAIN RESTAURANTS WHERE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SMOKE AS LONG AS THEY HAVE AN ENCLOSURE  (fe_03_06323-A-0046)
YOU KNOW FOR THE NON SMOKERS  (fe_03_06323-A-0047)
YOU CAN'T BRING YOUR CHILDREN INTO THAT AREA IF THEY'RE UNDER EIGHTEEN  (fe_03_06323-A-0049)
SO THIS IS WHERE I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS I THINK IT'S UP TO THE PARENTS TO MAKE THAT DECISION WHETHER OR NOT  (fe_03_06323-A-0050)
THEIR CHILD SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO SMOKE OR NOT  (fe_03_06323-A-0051)
SO LET'S SAY I'M A SMOKER AND I GO INTO A RESTAURANT  (fe_03_06323-A-0052)
[LIPSMACK] AND I HAVE TO CHO- I HAVE MY KIDS WITH ME AND THEY'RE UNDER EIGHTEEN  (fe_03_06323-A-0053)
I HAVE TO  (fe_03_06323-A-0054)
EITHER  (fe_03_06323-A-0055)
SIT AWAY FROM MY KIDS OR GO TO NON SMOKING AND IT TAKES AWAY CHOICE WHICH IS WHAT OUR COUNTRY'S BASED ON OUR FREEDOM  (fe_03_06323-A-0056)
AND I THINK WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF FREEDOM WITH IT  (fe_03_06323-A-0057)
NO NO NO NO I SAID THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE A SAY  (fe_03_06323-A-0058)
I AM  (fe_03_06323-A-0059)
RIGHT RIGHT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE A SAY I THINK IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL PARENTS  (fe_03_06323-A-0060)
UM  (fe_03_06323-A-0061)
RIGHT I'M IN FAVOR OF BANNING IT BUT I DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOULD HAVE THE SAY  (fe_03_06323-A-0062)
DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING I THINK  (fe_03_06323-A-0063)
THE GOVERNMENT BUT I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD I THINK IT SHOULD BE UP TO INDIVIDUAL RESTAURANTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_06323-A-0064)
THE GOVERNMENT HAS A RIGHT TO STEP IN AND SAY YOU CAN'T DO THIS YOU CAN'T DO THAT UM YOU CAN'T BRING YOUR CHILD TO THIS  (fe_03_06323-A-0065)
RESTAURANT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A NO SMOKING SECTION AVAILABLE FOR YOU FOR THEM  (fe_03_06323-A-0066)
UM THEY'RE THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY TOO MANY RIGHTS  (fe_03_06323-A-0067)
I MEAN I'M A CHILD OF SEVEN KIDS AND NONE OF US ARE ALCOHOLICS OR DRUG ADDICTS OR UM BECAUSE I GREW UP WITH  (fe_03_06323-A-0068)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06323-A-0069)
DON'T SPARE THE ROD BECAUSE YOU'LL SPOIL THE CHILD  (fe_03_06323-A-0070)
TODAY'S DAY AND AGE YOU KNOW YOU TAP YOUR KIDS ON THE BUTT AND YOU KNOW THE CHILD CAN THEN TURN AROUND AND CALL CHILD PROTECTION AND SAY THEY WERE BEING ABUSED AND THEY'RE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU AND  (fe_03_06323-A-0071)
[SIGH] THAT MAY NOT BE THE CASE  (fe_03_06323-A-0072)
AND I THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS WRONG WITH OUR COUNTRY TODAY 'CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IT TAKES TOO MANY STANDS TAKES THE PARENTAL RIGHTS AWAY  (fe_03_06323-A-0073)
NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA TAKE AWAY THE PARENTAL RIGHTS ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU COULD TAKE YOUR CHILD TO A PLACE THAT HAS SMOKING ESTABLISHMENTS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06323-A-0074)

WHAT I THINK IS MAYBE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD DO I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GONNA WORK I DON'T KNOW BUT IF IT IT'S EVEN BEEN PRESENTED BUT BUT THERE PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT CAN GIVE  (fe_03_06323-A-0079)
FOR EXAMPLE RESTAURANTS SPECIAL BONUSES IF THEY DO DO THIS  (fe_03_06323-A-0080)
BUT NOT TO MAKE IT  (fe_03_06323-A-0081)

UM AND AND I ALSO THINK THAT [NOISE] MAYBE AH IT'S NOT EVEN JUST AN ELEMENT OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO ABOUT IT BUT HOW  (fe_03_06323-B-0039)
[NOISE] THAT IT'S ALSO CULTURAL BECAUSE [NOISE]  (fe_03_06323-B-0040)

I THINK BANNING THINGS IS ALWAYS THE BEST WAY OF OF GETTING PEOPLE TO NOT DO STUPID THINGS LIKE I I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH A LOT OF LEGAL UM A LOT OF LIKE I DON'T AGREE WITH THE THE UM  (fe_03_06323-B-0044)
MAKING CERTAIN DRUGS ILLEGAL THAT ARE CERT- CURRENTLY ILLEGAL 'CAUSE I THINK IT MAKES THE PROBLEM WORSE  (fe_03_06323-B-0046)
SO TO ME IT HAS TO ME IT HAS TO BECOME SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN  (fe_03_06323-B-0048)
