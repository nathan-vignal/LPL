EVEN THOUGH THAT THE HEART WAS BADLY DAMAGED WITHIN THOSE TWO YEARS IT HAD STARTED TO HEAL ITSELF BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SMOKING  (fe_03_06326-A-0029)
YES I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE BUT IT DID IT  (fe_03_06326-A-0030)

I THINK I THINK THE SHOWING OF THE LUNGS AND I THINK SHOWING THIS TO KIDS WOULD IMPACT THEM MORE THAN JUST AN AD ON T._V. SAYING NO DON'T DO THIS BLAH BLAH BLAH BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAY ATTENTION THEY THINK OH IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND THEY KEEP ON GOING  (fe_03_06326-A-0046)
IT HAS TO BE THEIR CHOICE  (fe_03_06326-A-0047)
I THINK SO JUST LIKE A._A. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UNTIL THAT PERSON WANTS TO DO IT YOU CAN TALK TILL YOU'RE BLUE IN THE FACE AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS  (fe_03_06326-A-0048)

WITH A LITTLE BABY AND SHE'S STANDING THERE SMOKING A CIGARETTE AND THE BABY'S FACE IS LIKE TWO INCHES AWAY FROM HERS I'M THINKING  (fe_03_06326-A-0055)
