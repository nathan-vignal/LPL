I KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE NON SMOKERS BUT THEY JUMP IN A CAR THEY HAVE A VERY EXPENSIVE CAR WHICH CONSUMES TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF UM  (fe_03_06311-B-0011)
FUEL GASOLINE AND THEY DO MORE POLLUTING IN A DAY THAN A THAN THE AVERAGE LIKE CHAIN SMOKER WILL DO IN A LIFETIME  (fe_03_06311-B-0012)
THEREFORE I AM SOMEWHAT  (fe_03_06311-B-0013)

LIMIT SMOKING 'CAUSE I'M ALL FOR ANTI SMOKING CAMPAIGNS I THINK EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER  (fe_03_06311-B-0015)

IT'S QUITE IT'S AH OTHER [MN] WELL IN ITSELF IT'S BY DEFINITION IT'S SELF DESTRUCTIVE BUT ALSO  (fe_03_06311-B-0026)
THERE ARE ALSO MANY O- OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH OUR MONEY [MN] AND WI- AND I REMEMBER I THINK I QUIT SMOKING WHEN CIGARETTES WERE ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY A PACK  (fe_03_06311-B-0027)
SO I MEAN THAT WAS BEFORE THAT WAS BEFORE THE FLOOD [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] BUT I REMEM- AND I REMEMBER THE MOST IMPORTANT THE REASON THAT I DID WAS THAT IRONICALLY ENOUGH I WAS SMOKING ABOUT A PACK A DAY AND I WAS  (fe_03_06311-B-0028)
HOME DURING COLLEGE AND UM  (fe_03_06311-B-0029)
MY BROTHER I LEFT MY CIGARETTES ON THE UM ON THE BUREAU  (fe_03_06311-B-0030)

AND I SAID WELL I'LL FIX HIM I'LL NEVER SMOKE AGAIN [LAUGHTER] AND THAT WAS THE END OF IT  (fe_03_06311-B-0032)
