YEAH I [MN] I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE APPEAL I KNOW WHEN [MN] WHEN I WAS A KID IT DID NOT SEEM  (fe_03_06357-B-0089)
I KNEW PEOPLE WHO STARTED SMOKING 'CAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS COOL BUT I GUESS [MN] FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SEEING MY PARENTS WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND HACK UP A LUNG BEFORE THEY COULD EVEN GET OUT OF BED  (fe_03_06357-B-0090)
AND KNOWING THAT LIKE OUR HOUSE NO MATTER HOW CLEAN WE KEPT IT ALWAYS SMELLED LIKE SMOKE  (fe_03_06357-B-0091)

E- E- EXACTLY EXACTLY I THINK THE ONLY HOPE WITH STUFF LIKE RAISING PRICES IS IF YOU MAKE IT HARDER FOR TEENAGERS TO GET IT  (fe_03_06357-B-0099)
HOPEFULLY FEWER PEOPLE WILL START SMOKING  (fe_03_06357-B-0100)
AND THEN YOU KNOW MAYBE OVER TIME BUT YEAH IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY EFFECT  (fe_03_06357-B-0101)
