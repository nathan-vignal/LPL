UM YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T BE FOR SMOKING IN THEATRES  (fe_03_06320-B-0036)
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY DISTRACTING AND ESPECIALLY IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06320-B-0037)
FOR THE NON SMOKER BECAUSE ONCE I BECAME A NON SMOKER I KNOW THAT UM IT WOULD BOTHER ME IF SOMEBODY SAT AND SMOKED CONSISTENTLY LIKE IF I LIVED WITH A SMOKER YES I'D BE COMPLETELY FINE IF THEY WENT OUT AND SMOKED OR  (fe_03_06320-B-0038)
OR STUFF LIKE THAT SO SO IN THE THEATRE I GUESS IT WOULD BOTHER ME JUST BECAUSE THE SMOKE WOULD BOTHER ME AND IF YOU LIKE  (fe_03_06320-B-0039)
BRING IN LIKE THOUGHTS THAT I DIDN'T WANT  (fe_03_06320-B-0040)
AH AND I KNOW THAT HAVING LIVED WITH OTHER NON SMOKERS THAT HOW THAT SMOKE WOULD BOTHER ME BUT I THINK I THINK THAT PERHAPS THERE'S  (fe_03_06320-B-0041)
A HAPPY MEDIUM BECAUSE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06320-B-0042)
AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S FREE CHOICE FOR EVERYBODY  (fe_03_06320-B-0043)
AND IF SOMEBODY CHOOSES TO SMOKE THEN THAT'S THEIR CHOICE  (fe_03_06320-B-0044)
AND IF SOMEBODY DOES NOT CHOOSE TO SMOKE THAT'S THEIR CHOICE AND I FEEL LIKE PERHAPS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IS ALLOW  (fe_03_06320-B-0045)
YOU KNOW THEY THEY STILL HAVE THAT THING LIKE WHEN I WHEN I TRAVEL ABROAD IN LOS ANGELES OR ANYWHERE IN THE U._S. YOU JUST CAN'T SMOKE YOU CAN'T SMOKE ANYWHERE IN THE AIRPORT YOU'D HAVE TO LIKE WALK OUT  (fe_03_06320-B-0046)
A A HALF AN HOUR OUT OF THE TERMINAL AND THEN SMOKE  (fe_03_06320-B-0047)
BUT IN IN ASIAN COUNTRIES WHAT THEY DO IS THEY HAVE WHAT THEY CALL SMOKING SECTIONS  (fe_03_06320-B-0048)
AND THEY HAVE SMOKING ROOMS  (fe_03_06320-B-0049)
AIR CONDITIONING YOU CAN GO SIT DOWN AND YOU CAN READ MAGAZINES AND YOU CAN SMOKE SO THEY GIVE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO SMOKE A PLACE TO SMOKE  (fe_03_06320-B-0050)

I I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06320-B-0054)
YES YEAH  (fe_03_06320-B-0055)
IT'S TRYING TO CON- FORCE SOMEBODY TO MAKE A CHOICE WHICH I DO NOT THINK IS THE HAPPY MEDIUM OR THE WAY THE SPIRITUAL SOLUTION TO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TERRORISM OR WAR OR SMOKING OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_06320-B-0057)
I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE GIVEN A FREE CHOICE  (fe_03_06320-B-0058)
AND ONCE SOMETHING IS NOT NOT BANNED AND YOU KNOW AND IT'S A FREE CHOICE BUT YOU HA- IF YOU WANT TO DO IT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AREA TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO  (fe_03_06320-B-0059)
YEAH AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT BOILS DOWN TO AN ECONOMIC PROFIT WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE REASON FOR A LOT OF DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE  (fe_03_06320-B-0062)
AND UM YOU KNOW AND I THINK AND I THINK THAT'S FINE YOU KNOW AH IF SOMEBODY IS A MINOR IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS YES DO NOT ALLOW SMOKING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT'S LIKE SAY AT A CERTAIN AGE A PERSON HAS A CHOICE  (fe_03_06320-B-0063)
BUT HAVE SECTIONS BUT ALLOW PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SMOKE TO CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO TILL THEY MAKE A CHOICE NOT TO YOU KNOW AND THE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO SMOKE  (fe_03_06320-B-0064)
DON'T YOU KNOW CAN STILL ENJOY THE SAME BENEFITS AND DON'T HAVE TO BE UM YOU KNOW IN AREAS OR THAT THAT THAT SMOKING IS ALLOWED SO SO THAT'S  (fe_03_06320-B-0065)
