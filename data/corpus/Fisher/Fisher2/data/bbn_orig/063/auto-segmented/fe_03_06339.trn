I AM AN EX SMOKER  (fe_03_06339-A-0005)
AND I HAVE BEEN QUIT NOW FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS BUT I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE  (fe_03_06339-A-0006)
I HAVE A FRIEND THAT LIVES IN ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE TRYING TO PASS A LAW THERE THAT SAYS THAT YOU CANNOT SMOKE IN YOUR CAR OR ANYWHERE  (fe_03_06339-A-0007)
IN A PUBLIC PLACE OR AROUND A PUBLIC PLACE  (fe_03_06339-A-0008)
NOT EVEN IN YOUR CAR SHE SAID THEY'RE TRYING TO PASS THIS LAW WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY STOP YOU AND GIVE YOU A TICKET IF YOU SMOKE IN YOUR CAR  (fe_03_06339-A-0009)
I SAID DO YOU THINK THAT'S REALLY GOING TO WORK SHE SAID WELL THEY'RE TRYING IT FOR CELLPHONES AND THAT HASN'T WORKED SO FAR  (fe_03_06339-A-0010)

MHM  (fe_03_06339-A-0012)
WELL I WOULD THINK WELL SEE BUT I WOULD THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE PATIOS  (fe_03_06339-A-0013)
WHERE YOU CAN GO SIT OUTSIDE AND SMOKE NOW HOW WOULD THEY WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO STOP SOMEONE IF THEY'RE ALREADY OUTSIDE  (fe_03_06339-A-0014)

WELL AND AND SEE THAT'S MY OPINION IS IF IT'S A RESTAURANT OR AN ESTABLISHMENT THAT ALLOWS YOU KNOW THAT HAS A NO SMOKING POLICY  (fe_03_06339-A-0024)
AND I'M THINKING THAT'S FINE BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND YOU HAVE THE CHOICE OF EITHER EATING THERE OR GOING SOMEPLACE ELSE  (fe_03_06339-A-0025)
BUT AIRPORTS HAVE LOUNGES WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CORDONED OFF AND THEY'RE LIKE IN A ROOM THAT YOU WALK BY AND YOU SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE SMOKING AND THERE'S A HAZE THAT SITS OVER THE ROOM  (fe_03_06339-A-0026)

AND MY UH  (fe_03_06339-A-0029)
MY OPINION IS YOU'RE SITTING ON THE AIRPLANE NEXT TO SOMEONE WHO EITHER SMELLS LIKE OLD ASHTRAYS  (fe_03_06339-A-0030)
BUT AGAIN YOU CAN SIT ON THE AIRPLANE NEXT TO SOMEONE WHO HASN'T BATHED IN THREE DAYS  (fe_03_06339-A-0031)

YEAH BUT SEE WOULDN'T THAT MAKE MORE SENSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO THE EXPENSE OF OF GETTING THESE PEOPLE IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU WANT TO BE FAIR TO EVERYONE  (fe_03_06339-A-0034)
IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT THEN THAT IS UH TO ME THAT IS A- AN OPTION THAT SHOULD BE CON- TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IF YOU DON'T WANNA OFFER THEM THIS OPTION THEN FINE DON'T  (fe_03_06339-A-0035)

JUST STOP AND THINK OF THE DIFFERENCE WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER BE W- STANDING NEXT TO SOMEONE [LAUGHTER] WHO'S SMOKING A CIGARETTE THAT IT'S TAKING GOING TO TAKE THEM FIVE MINUTES TO SMOKE AND THEY PUT IT OUT  (fe_03_06339-A-0042)
OR STAND AT A BUS STOP THAT YOU KNOW EVERY FIVE MINUTES A CAR OR A BUS IS GOING TO COME BY AND BLOW TOXIC FUMES INTO YOUR FACE  (fe_03_06339-A-0043)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06339-A-0044)

BECAUSE  (fe_03_06339-A-0085)
I I THINK THAT THAT IS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT TO CHOOSE  (fe_03_06339-A-0086)
I THINK THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT SHOULD HAVE THAT CHOICE AND THAT WAY IF THEY YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT THEY HAVE TO GET A SPECIAL LICENSE TO HAVE SOMEONE SMOKE IN THEIR BUILDING  (fe_03_06339-A-0087)
BUT SEE BUT IT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE BUSINESS WILL EITHER WANT TO GET THE SPECIAL LICENSE OR NOT GET THE SPECIAL LICENSE  (fe_03_06339-A-0088)
