HELLO  (fe_03_06346-A-0001)
I'M TERRI [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0002)
I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY I'M ON MY CELLPHONE  (fe_03_06346-A-0003)
[LAUGHTER] OKAY  (fe_03_06346-A-0004)
UH HAVE YOU EVER SMOKED JACLYN  (fe_03_06346-A-0005)
I WAS A SMOKER FOR THIRTY YEARS  (fe_03_06346-A-0006)
AND I ACTUALLY STOPPED ABOUT  (fe_03_06346-A-0007)
MM I STOPPED IN NINETY FOUR  (fe_03_06346-A-0008)
YEAH YEAH I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THE ADS AND ALL REALLY THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON MY DECISION NOT TO SMOKE  (fe_03_06346-A-0009)
WHAT MADE ME STOP SMOKING WAS THAT IT IT ACTUALLY BECAME SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE  (fe_03_06346-A-0010)
YOU KNOW ON MY JOB I WAS ON THE EIGHTH FLOOR IN ORDER TO SMOKE I HAD TO GO OUTSIDE  (fe_03_06346-A-0011)
AND TRYING TO GET DOWN  (fe_03_06346-A-0012)
STAIRS TO FIND TIME TO SMOKE IT JUST BECAME SO MUCH OF A HASSLE  (fe_03_06346-A-0013)
BUT YOU KNOW I I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THE PRINT ADS HELP BUT I REALLY THINK WHEN YOU BAN IT AND YOU MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO SMOKE IT HELPS MORE THAN THE ACTUAL SEEING THE ADS  (fe_03_06346-A-0014)
UH I'M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH QUIT NET I'VE SEEN THE ADVERTISEMENTS ON T._V. AND I'M NOT SO SURE HOW MUCH THE SUPPORT  (fe_03_06346-A-0015)
[MN] REALLY HELPS A PERSON TO STOP SMOKING FOR ME IT JUST CAME TO A POINT I JUST MADE UP MY MIND I WASN'T GOING TO DO IT ANYMORE  (fe_03_06346-A-0016)
YEAH THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT WAS FOR ME AND IT IT JUST AND AND THAT AND THE FACT THAT IT BECAME SO EXPENSIVE AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT WHAT ELSE I COULD BE DOING WITH THAT MONEY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0017)
YES  (fe_03_06346-A-0018)
BUT IT IT JUST IT WAS SUCH A HASSLE AND YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME NOW TO BE AROUND PEOPLE THAT SMOKE AND WHEN I STOPPED SMOKING I DIDN'T BECOME ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT GOT ON EVERYBODY'S CASES ABOUT SMOKING  (fe_03_06346-A-0019)
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A PERSONAL DECISION THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE AND I DID TRY TO STOP THREE OR FOUR TIMES BEFORE I ACTUALLY JUST SAID THIS IS IT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT ANY MORE  (fe_03_06346-A-0020)
AND I ALSO STARTED SEEING A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND ME I MEAN MY BROTHER IN LAW HAD THROAT CANCER  (fe_03_06346-A-0021)
THAT HAS NOT STOPPED HIM FROM SMOKING  (fe_03_06346-A-0022)
UM MY O- O- ONE OF MY [MN] I CALL MY ADOPTED DADS HE HAD THROAT CANCER HE HAD SMOKED FOR YEARS IT DID FINALLY YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT STOPPED HIM  (fe_03_06346-A-0023)
BUT IT JUST CAME TO A POINT IT WAS A PERSONAL DECISION THAT IT WASN'T HEALTHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT AND I'M JUST NOT GOING TO DO THIS ANY MORE  (fe_03_06346-A-0024)
AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO STOP ON MY BIRTHDAY I SAID THIS BIRTHDAY IS GOING TO REPRESENT THE REST OF MY LIFE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0025)
AND I DID IT I MEAN NO NO PATCHES NO HYPNOSIS NO EARRINGS AND I HAVE FRIENDS THAT WENT THROUGH ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO TRY TO HELP THEM QUIT SMOKING AND MOST OF THEM ARE STILL SMOKING  (fe_03_06346-A-0026)
MHM  (fe_03_06346-A-0028)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0029)
SURE DID WELL MY GODCHILDREN USED TO UM ALL OF MY GODCHILDREN USED TO SAY WHY DON'T YOU STOP SMOKING WE WANT YOU TO STOP SMOKING NOW THEIR BOTH OF THEIR PARENTS SMOKED BUT FOR SOME REASON I GUESS THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD  (fe_03_06346-A-0030)
PREY ON MY CONSCIENCE EASIER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0031)
SO THEY WERE THEY WERE CONSTANTLY YOU KNOW THEY REFUSED TO GO GET CIGARETTES FOR ME IF THEY I COULD SEND THEM TO THE STORE FOR ANYTHING BUT IF I SAID I NEED A PACK OF CIGARETTES NO I'M NOT GOING TO GET 'EM FOR YOU [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0032)
SO YOU KNOW THEY THAT HAD A BIG INFLUENCE AND I I WOULD NOT SMOKE AROUND KIDS I WOULDN'T SMOKE AROUND LITTLE KIDS I WOULDN'T SMOKE AROUND BABIES BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE SECONDHAND SMOKE IS UNHEALTHY  (fe_03_06346-A-0033)
AND I I DID NOT WANNA BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT SO THAT WAS THE OTHER WAY THAT MY SMOKING BECAME RESTRICTED BECAUSE MY GODCHILDREN STARTING HAVING BABIES AND I WOULD BE AROUND THEM IT WAS LIKE WELL I CAN'T SMOKE WHILE I'M HERE  (fe_03_06346-A-0034)
SO IT IT WAS REALLY A DECISION THAT IF I WANTED TO HAVE A FULL AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE I HAD TO QUIT SMOKING  (fe_03_06346-A-0035)
AND I- IT'S DEFINITELY BEEN WORTH IT BUT I KNOW IT IS VERY DIFFICULT THAT'S WHY I DON'T YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE I KNOW THAT SMOKE  (fe_03_06346-A-0036)
EVEN WHEN I HEAR 'EM SAY THEY WANNA STOP SMOKING I JUST SAY TO THEM YOU KNOW IF YOU WANNA STOP IT'S A DECISION YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOU HAVE TO DO IT NOBODY CAN DO IT FOR YOU  (fe_03_06346-A-0037)
BUT  (fe_03_06346-A-0038)
AND AND IT YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY  (fe_03_06346-A-0039)
WHEN I QUIT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN MY FAMILY THOUGHT THAT I WAS GOING TO STICK TO IT [LAUGHTER] BUT A COU- COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER I QUIT MY DAD GOT VERY SICK WITH CANCER AND WE NURSED HIM AND TOOK CARE OF HIM FOR SIX MONTHS UNTIL HE PASSED  (fe_03_06346-A-0040)
AND ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER MY DAD PASSED MY SISTER AND I WERE SITTING THERE TALKING AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT  (fe_03_06346-A-0041)
I WOULD BET EVERY PENNY I HAD THAT YOU WILL NEVER SMOKE AGAIN I SAID WHY SHE SAID IF YOU DIDN'T SMOKE WITH EVERYTHING WE WENT THROUGH WITH DADDY THEN YOU'LL NEVER SMOKE AGAIN  (fe_03_06346-A-0042)
AND IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I NEVER WAS EVEN TEMPTED  (fe_03_06346-A-0043)
WHEREAS BEFORE IN A STRESSFUL SITUATION THE FIRST THING I'D DO WAS REACH FOR A CIGARETTE AND WOULD JUST SMOKE ONE RIGHT BEHIND THE OTHER  (fe_03_06346-A-0044)
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I'D REALLY KICKED THIS HABIT  (fe_03_06346-A-0045)
YES IT'S IT'S REALLY BEEN HARD BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE FOR SOME PEOPLE THE PRINT ADS IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_06346-A-0046)
LIKE I SAID I'VE SEEN 'EM UH ADVERTISING THE QUIT NET THING OVER THE T._V. AND AND I I GUESS A A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NEED SUPPORT BUT I JUST FE- FEEL LIKE IF YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND IT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE WILLPOWER TO STICK TO IT  (fe_03_06346-A-0047)
WELL I HOPE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE I'M SEEING MORE AND MORE KIDS SMOKING  (fe_03_06346-A-0048)
AND BUYING CIGARETTES WHEN I GO INTO STORES AND I SO I SIT ON THE PORCH AND I WATCH THE KIDS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STREET AND THEY'RE JUST PUFFING AWAY AND I'M LIKE THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06346-A-0049)
YEAH IF I'M GOING TO TALK TO SOMEBODY ABOUT NOT SMOKING THAT'S WHO I DO TALK TO IS THE YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VE DONE IT FOR FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS IT'S IT'S A DEVIL TRYING TO KICK THAT HABIT  (fe_03_06346-A-0050)
I'M TELLING YOU IT IS SO EXPENSIVE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0051)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0052)
YEAH CERTAINLY AND A PACK OF CIGARETTES COSTS YOU LIKE FOUR DOLLARS  (fe_03_06346-A-0053)
AND I THINK WHEN I STARTED SMOKING I THINK A PACK OF CIGARETTES COST ME LIKE FIFTY FIVE CENTS  (fe_03_06346-A-0054)
[LAUGHTER] AND THAT REALLY THAT RE- THAT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH ME QUITTING BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS BECOMING TOO EXPENSIVE  (fe_03_06346-A-0055)
AND EVERY TIME THEY RAISE TAXES ON SOMETHING  (fe_03_06346-A-0056)
THE FIRST THING THEY THINK ABOUT IS CIGARETTES YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD PRICE THEM OUT OF PEOPLE'S HABIT  (fe_03_06346-A-0057)
BUT I'M I'M HOPING THAT MORE KIDS WILL PAY ATTENTION TO THE ADS AND WILL LISTEN AND PE- AND PEOPLE WILL TRY TO DISCOURAGE THEM BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A VERY UNHEALTHY HABIT  (fe_03_06346-A-0058)
AND I DON'T IT'S NOTHING ATTRACTIVE ABOUT IT I MEAN I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS COMING UP EVERYBODY YOU SAW ON T._V. WAS SMOKING A CIGARETTE IT WAS GLAMOROUS TO PUFF A CIGARETTE  (fe_03_06346-A-0059)
YES  (fe_03_06346-A-0060)
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT IT WAS THE THING TO DO TO HAVE THIS IN YOUR HAND IT LOOKED SO COOL [NOISE]  (fe_03_06346-A-0061)
BUT YOU KNOW LUCKILY THE UH FORTUNATELY THEY'RE NOT SHOWING PEOPLE SMOKING IN ON TELEVISION A- AND THAT'S WHY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PICKING THIS HABIT UP  (fe_03_06346-A-0062)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH BUT YOU SAID YOU'VE HAD CHILDREN DO YOU T- HOW OLD ARE YOUR CHILDREN  (fe_03_06346-A-0063)
OH  (fe_03_06346-A-0064)
WELL YOU HAVE YOUR YEAH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0065)
BUT HOPEFULLY THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A HABIT THAT THEY WON'T PICK UP  (fe_03_06346-A-0066)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06346-A-0067)
I THINK ABOUT WHAT I WOULD PAY FOR A CARTON OF CIGARETTES I COULD GO OUT AND BUY ME A WONDERFUL MEAL ME AND A FRIEND  (fe_03_06346-A-0070)
YOU KNOW AND I JUST WISH THAT I HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE MONEY AWAY THAT I WAS SPENDING ON CIGARETTES  (fe_03_06346-A-0071)
'CAUSE I WOULD HAVE A NICE LITTLE SUM OF MONEY RIGHT NOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06346-A-0072)
[LAUGHTER] BUT I DO HOPE  (fe_03_06346-A-0073)
I HOPE THAT THEY DO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ADS 'CAUSE LIKE I SAID IT MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR SOME PEOPLE AND AND AS YOU SAID PROBABLY FOR THE YOUNGER FOLK  (fe_03_06346-A-0074)
IF IT CAN DISC- DISCOURAGE THEM THEN IT'S WORTH IT  (fe_03_06346-A-0075)
BUT IT'S  (fe_03_06346-A-0076)
