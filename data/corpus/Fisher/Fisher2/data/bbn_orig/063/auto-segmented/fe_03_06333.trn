IT ALMOST CHOKES YOU  (fe_03_06333-B-0008)
I KNOW IT'S IT'S REALLY KIND OF A HARD STAND TO MAKE BECAUSE MY MOTHER SHE'S OVERWEIGHT AND SHE'S A VERY HEAVY SMOKER  (fe_03_06333-B-0009)
AND I JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE HER GOING TO A MALL OR EVEN TO PER SAY WALMART AND HAVING TO SAY OUTSIDE AND SMOKE HER CIGARETTE AH BECAUSE SHE JUST WOULDN'T GO  (fe_03_06333-B-0010)
BUT ME ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW I CAN GO INTO A BIG STADIUM OR A BIG AUDITORIUM AND KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO GET CHOKED TO DEATH BY EVERYBODY ELSE SMOKING  (fe_03_06333-B-0011)

TRY TO HELP PREVENT NEW SMOKERS IN THAT CONCEPT OF YOU KNOW YOUNGER  (fe_03_06333-B-0013)
TEENAGERS AND JUST YOUNG KIDS ALL IN GENERAL FROM SMOKING  (fe_03_06333-B-0014)
I DON'T THINK IT'S HURTING ANY ANY EITHER  (fe_03_06333-B-0015)
I THINK I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT DO SMOKE IT GETS MORE ANNOYING  (fe_03_06333-B-0016)
TO SEE THE CONSTANT ADS OF YOU KNOW THESE COMMERCIALS THAT ARE ARE REALLY HITTING TOWARDS THE YOUNG TEENAGERS OF TALK TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT NOT SMOKING YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT'S THEIR CHOICE  (fe_03_06333-B-0017)
BUT IT'S A VERY  (fe_03_06333-B-0018)
HARD CHOICE TO MAKE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET PEER PRESSURE AND THEN ONCE YOU START DOING IT HEY LOOK NOW I'M COOL  (fe_03_06333-B-0019)
BUT IN REALITY IF YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO DO THAT TO BE COOL YOU'RE HANGING WITH THE WRONG PARENTS ANYWAYS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06333-B-0020)
YEAH  (fe_03_06333-B-0022)
IN THAT SAME ASPECT IT'S ALMOST BANNING THEIR RIGHT  (fe_03_06333-B-0023)
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR THEY HAVE THEIR FREEDOM TO SMOKE  (fe_03_06333-B-0024)
BUT ALSO AND EVERYBODY'S SAYING WELL YOU CAN'T SMOKE HERE YOU CAN'T SMOKE HERE YOU CAN'T SMOKE HERE AND YOU CAN'T SMOKE THERE BEING A NON SMOKER I SAY YEAH GO FOR IT  (fe_03_06333-B-0025)
[LAUGHTER] BUT IF I WAS A SMOKER IT'S LIKE HOW MANY MORE HANDCUFFS ARE YOU GOING TO PUT ON ME UNTIL THE FACT OF I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE NOT EVEN IN MY OWN HOME BECAUSE MY CHILDREN ARE IN THERE AND SMOKE  (fe_03_06333-B-0026)
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SMOKE YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOURSELF A BUBBLE THAT YOU CAN WALK OUTSIDE IN SMOKE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06333-B-0029)
I MEAN BECAUSE EVEN WHEN OU GO IN THE WOODS AND STUFF  (fe_03_06333-B-0030)
YOU KNOW THEY THEY TELL THE SMOKERS THEY'LL ASK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO CAMPING IF YOU'RE SMOKERS AND IF YOU ARE YOU KNOW MAKE SURE YOUR CIGARETTE BUTT IS OUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE IT  (fe_03_06333-B-0031)
YOU DROP IT ON THE GROUND AND SMEAR IT OUT OR NOT AND THAT'S OUT IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS  (fe_03_06333-B-0032)
BUT THIS SO QUICKLY THAT THAT JUST ONE BUTT CAN CATCH ON FIRE AND JUST DESTROY YOU  (fe_03_06333-B-0033)
KNOW SO MUCH UM YOU KNOW HOUSES TO UNFORTUNATELY INNOCENT CHILDREN OR FAMILY MEMBERS TO WILDLIFE  (fe_03_06333-B-0034)
IT'S IT'S YOU KIND OF WONDER IF THE CAUSE IS GREATER THAN THE YOU KNOW CONCEPT OF SMOKING  (fe_03_06333-B-0035)
RIGHT BUT I MEAN THEY THEY FUSS AND COMPLAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE KIDS ARE BEING BEAT AT HOME WHEN THEY'RE ONLY GETTING DISCIPLINED BUT YET YOU HAVE THESE YOU KNOW EXTREME CASES WHERE [NOISE]  (fe_03_06333-B-0036)
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE WHY ARE YOU EVEN GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS  (fe_03_06333-B-0037)
AND SMOKING  (fe_03_06333-B-0038)
YOU KNOW IT HAS ITS GOOD POINTS FOR MY SISTER YOU KNOW SHE HAD THREE KIDS FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT AGAIN NERVOUS WRECK  (fe_03_06333-B-0039)
AH HER HUSBAND WAS GONE MOST OF THE DAY BECAUSE OF HIS JOB AND SHE WAS A HOUSEWIFE AND SHE COULDN'T TAKE ANY KIND OF MEDICINES BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT  (fe_03_06333-B-0040)
AND THEY JUST TOLD AND THE DOCTOR FLAT OUT TOLD HER YOU NEED TO SMOKE AT LEAST NO MORE THAN TWO CIGARETTES A DAY  (fe_03_06333-B-0041)
TO KEEP YOUR NERVES DOWN OTHERWISE YOU WILL MISCARRY  (fe_03_06333-B-0042)
AND UM [MN] SHE SAID THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT SHE COULD STAY CALM IF HER YOU KNOW OTHER THREE GIRLS  (fe_03_06333-B-0043)
AH WERE JUST GOING FRENETICALLY CRAZY  (fe_03_06333-B-0044)
BECAUSE SHE HAD HER FIRST THREE IN THREE YEARS SO YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE THEY [LAUGHTER] ARE  (fe_03_06333-B-0045)
WELL TOTAL WERE SHE HAD FOUR KIDS IN FIVE YEARS  (fe_03_06333-B-0046)
SO SHE WAITED ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE SHE HAD THE [LAUGHTER] OTHER ONE SO  (fe_03_06333-B-0047)
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THEIR AGES AND GOING THROUGH THE POTTY TRAINING ISSUES AND THEM STARTING TO GET THE SASSY MOUTH AND THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD CALM HERSELF AND I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HER MISCARRY AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HER  (fe_03_06333-B-0048)
UM LOSE THE BABY AND GO ON A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN BUT ON THE SAME ASPECT I KNOW THAT CIGARETTES THAT SHE'S INHALING ARE HURTING THE BABY  (fe_03_06333-B-0049)
AND IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_06333-B-0050)
NO [LAUGHTER] BUT SHE'S NOT A HEAVY SMOKER AS SHE ONCE WAS  (fe_03_06333-B-0051)
ACTUALLY IN THAT ASPECT IT'S GOOD BUT SHE DOESN'T SHE DOES GO OUTSIDE SHE DOESN'T CARE IF IT'S FREEZING COLD OUTSIDE  (fe_03_06333-B-0052)
SHE SAID THAT IT MAKES HER SMOKE IT A LOT QUICKER AND SHE'S BACK IN THE HOUSE [LAUGHTER] SHE SAYS BUT SHE'S NOT DOING IT AROUND HER KIDS SHE DID IT WHILE THEY WERE PREGNANT YOU KNOW WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH EACH OF EM  (fe_03_06333-B-0053)
THE ONLY SIDE EFFECT THAT ONE OF THE LAST ONE CAME OUT WITH WAS A CLEFT LIP AND THEY SAID THAT YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY COME FROM SMOKING  (fe_03_06333-B-0055)
AND THE DOCTOR SAID WELL SINCE YOU'VE CUT DOWN SO DRAMATICALLY FROM WHAT YOU WERE SMOKING YOU KNOW YOU'VE PROBABLY DONE DID THE BABY MORE GOOD THAN YOU DID HARM YOU KNOW BY SMOKING  (fe_03_06333-B-0056)
AND I COULDN'T GET ON HER BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT HER TO PHYSICALLY HURT HERSELF  (fe_03_06333-B-0057)
YOU KNOW AND JUST DO SOMETHING THAT SHE WOULD REGRET LATER  (fe_03_06333-B-0058)
BUT YET IN THE SAME ASPECT IT'S LIKE HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE AND DO THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE PREGNANT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THESE OTHER KIDS AND [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06333-B-0059)
AND SO I DON'T IT'S  (fe_03_06333-B-0060)
IT'S GOOD IF THEY IF IT KEEPS THE KIDS  (fe_03_06333-B-0061)
THE YOUNG KIDS OR EVEN UP TO THE TEENAGERS AND YOU KNOW THE LEGAL AGING  (fe_03_06333-B-0062)
TO KEEP THEM FROM BUYING THEM AND SMOKING THEM SO YOUNG GETTING THEM STARTED  (fe_03_06333-B-0063)
BUT IN THE SAME ASPECT I CAN IMAGINE THAT IT GETS ANNOYING FOR EVERYBODY ELSE WHO IS SMOKING  (fe_03_06333-B-0064)
WHO CONSTANTLY SEE THESE YOU KNOW DON'T SMOKE ADS  (fe_03_06333-B-0065)
BUT I THINK THEY KIND OF UNDERSTAND THE SAME ASPECT THAT THOSE COMMERCIALS ARE GEARED TOWARDS THE KIDS  (fe_03_06333-B-0066)
WHEREAS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THEM YOU'LL ASK IF  (fe_03_06333-B-0067)
THEY HADN'T STARTED WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE A SMOKER  (fe_03_06333-B-0068)
AND IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_06333-B-0069)
I THINK THEY HELP THE KIDS  (fe_03_06333-B-0070)
AND I THINK THE WAY THAT THEY'RE STARTING TO DO THEM MORE TOWARDS THE FACT OF THE PARENTS ARE GETTING INVOLVED  (fe_03_06333-B-0071)
I THINK THAT THAT IS A GOOD RESPONSE AND APPEARANCE FOR THE KIDS BECAUSE NOWADAYS THE PARENTS AREN'T INVOLVED  (fe_03_06333-B-0072)
AND THE CONCEPT OF YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE AH [NOISE]  (fe_03_06333-B-0073)
PROGRAMS THAT HELP THE KIDS TO STAY AWAY FROM IT YOU KNOW THESE BOWLING LEAGUES AND THE COMMUNITY CENTERS THAT HELP THE KIDS FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO  (fe_03_06333-B-0074)
BESIDES PUTTING THEMSELVES IN THAT PEER PRESSURE SITUATION  (fe_03_06333-B-0075)
AND IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW I'M GLAD TO SEE IT BECAUSE I HATE TO SEE THESE YOUNG KIDS ONE WASTING THEIR MONEY [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE THOSE THINGS LIKE YOU SAID ARE EXPENSIVE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06333-B-0076)
