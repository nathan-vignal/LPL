YEAH AND SOMEHOW IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_06319-A-0037)
THAT THE WAY THEY SURVIVE THE THE ONLY REASON CIGARETTE COMPANIES SURVIVE IS TO MAKE MORE PEOPLE BECOME ADDICTED SO IT'S KIND OF CONFLICTING IN THAT WAY  (fe_03_06319-A-0038)
UM  (fe_03_06319-A-0039)
YEAH I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS THE HUMAN SIDE OF SOMETHING LIKE I'M SURE LIKE COCAINE FARMERS  (fe_03_06319-A-0041)
SOMETHING LIKE THERE'S ALSO A HUMAN SIDE TO THAT TOO SO IT'S KIND OF A HARD HARD AH ARGUMENT TO MAKE FOR ME TOO  (fe_03_06319-A-0042)
AH BAN SMOKING IN ALL THE PUBLIC PLACES  (fe_03_06319-A-0043)
UM  (fe_03_06319-A-0044)
I THINK PEOPLE WOULD JUST HAVE TO DEAL LIKE I'M SURE THE THE ARGUMENT ON THE PRO SMOKING SIDE WILL BE LIKE OH THEY'RE TAKING AWAY THEIR THEIR RIGHT YOU KNOW TO  (fe_03_06319-A-0045)
TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT BUT IT'S REALLY NOT TRUE BECAUSE THEY'RE IMPOSING LIKE SECOND HAND SMOKE ON OTHERS  (fe_03_06319-A-0046)

EVEN WHEN IT'S OUTSIDE IS REALLY UNPLEASANT WE YOU KNOW NONE OF US LIKE IT BUT  (fe_03_06319-B-0006)
THE THE QUESTION THE THAT I DON'T UM HAVE ANY CLARITY ON IS IF WE TOOK AWAY THE OPTION TO SMOKE WOULD IT PRODUCE A VIOLENT REACTION FROM SMOKERS  (fe_03_06319-B-0007)
WE'RE IN L._A.  (fe_03_06319-B-0008)
MHM  (fe_03_06319-B-0009)

RIGHT  (fe_03_06319-B-0016)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06319-B-0017)
IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE IN TERMS OF UM WH- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IS IF PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SMOKING MAYBE THE SMOKING PREVENTION PROGRAMS WOULD REALLY HELP THE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO SMOKE  (fe_03_06319-B-0018)
THEY'RE  (fe_03_06319-B-0019)
NOT THAT THIS EVER REALLY HAPPENS BUT TO HAVE AN AWARENESS THAT THERE ARE L- OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T SMOKE IN AND UM NOT JUST WHERE IT'S BANNED BUT JUST PUBLIC AREAS  (fe_03_06319-B-0020)
BUT IT'S YOU KNOW IT IT THEN THEY ARE KIND OF SMOKING JUST ONLY IN THEIR  (fe_03_06319-B-0021)
OWN HOMES  (fe_03_06319-B-0022)
I  (fe_03_06319-B-0023)
I THINK IT COULD BE A COOPERATIVE  (fe_03_06319-B-0024)
VENTURE BUT  (fe_03_06319-B-0025)
YOU KNOW IT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SMOKE WHO DON'T WANT TO SMOKE IT'S IT'S AN ADDICTION IT'S NOT THAT NECESSARILY THEY'RE ENJOYING SMOKING OR THEY WOULD LIKE TO QUIT  (fe_03_06319-B-0026)
AND MAYBE IF MONEY WAS PUT INTO YOU KNOW MORE MONEY WAS PUT INTO THOSE PROGRAMS IT COULD HELP THOSE PEOPLE IT WOULDN'T HELP PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CONTINUE TO SMOKE  (fe_03_06319-B-0027)
RIGHT RIGHT I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT  (fe_03_06319-B-0028)
YEAH IF YOU'RE A S- AND I KNOW THAT UM  (fe_03_06319-B-0029)
WITH MY KIDS AND AH IT THE SCHOOL THAT THEY GO TO THERE ARE VERY FEW SMOKERS AND SO IT'S REALLY UNUSUAL TO MEET SOMEONE THAT SMOKES SO CONSEQUENTLY  (fe_03_06319-B-0030)
THERE ARE KIDS THAT TRY SMOKING BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY IN THE MINORITY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL IT IT'S NOT LIKE BECAUSE SO AND SO SMOKES ALL THESE OTHER KIDS ARE GOING TO SMOKE THEY DON'T SEE IT THAT OFTEN  (fe_03_06319-B-0031)
AND THEY MAKE A CHOICE NOT TO SMOKE  (fe_03_06319-B-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_06319-B-0033)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06319-B-0034)
RIGHT I THINK IT'S SO UNUSUAL I MEAN I MEAN I'M IN L._A. AND AND IT'S IT MO- THE PEOPLE THAT  (fe_03_06319-B-0035)
I'M AROUND OR THE RESTAURANTS THAT I FREQUENT ARE KIND OF HEALTH ORIENTED AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SMOKERS BUT THE OTHER THING IS IN L._A. THERE IS UM  (fe_03_06319-B-0036)
A BIG PRESENCE OF THE MOVIE INDUSTRY AND IF IT LOOKS COOL IN THE MOVIES OR THE UPSCALE RESTAURANTS  (fe_03_06319-B-0037)
CATER TO SMOKERS UM THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN ENLARGING PATIOS AND MAKING THEM KIND OF THE COOL PLACES THEN YOU WOULD SEE AN INCREASE BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY IS IS SUCH A A BIG INFLUENCE IN L._A.  (fe_03_06319-B-0038)
IF IF THEY PR- WELL THERE WAS THIS ARTICLE IN THE L._A. TIMES SAYING THAT IN RESTAURANTS CURRENTLY BEING BUILT THE UPSCALE RESTAURANTS IN HOLLYWOOD AND BEVERLY HILLS IN IN L._A.  (fe_03_06319-B-0039)
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY BEING PUT INTO PATIOS TO CATER TO THE SMOKERS  (fe_03_06319-B-0040)
AND AND SO THEN IF YOU IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW CELEBRITIES THAT ARE SEEN ON THE PATIO  (fe_03_06319-B-0041)
SMOKING AND THEY'RE CONSIDERED A COOL PERSON AND THE PATIOS ARE CONSIDERED COOL PLACES TO HANG OUT THEN YOU HAVE THESE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE  (fe_03_06319-B-0042)
THE WHOLE ARTICLE WAS ABOUT HOW EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T SMOKE WANT TO BE IN ON UM THESE PATIOS TO BE IN THIS COOL ENVIRONMENT  (fe_03_06319-B-0043)
AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF ODD YOU KNOW BECAUSE UM LUNG DISEASE AND CANCER AND DYING IS NOT VERY COOL YOU KNOW IT'S  (fe_03_06319-B-0044)
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ROMANTIC IT'S NOT PRETTY  (fe_03_06319-B-0045)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06319-B-0046)
YEAH AH THERE WAS UM A REALLY GREAT COMMERCIAL ON AN ANTI SMOKING COMMERCIAL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WITH THE MARLBOROUGH MAN WHO WAS DYING OF CANCER  (fe_03_06319-B-0047)
AND THE BROTHER WAS TALKING ABOUT IT HE WAS DOING THE VOICE VOICE OVER ON IT  (fe_03_06319-B-0048)
AND YOU SAW THE PICTURE OF MARLB- MARLBOROUGH MAN AND WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE IN HIS YOUTH AND THEN YOU SAW IN A HO- UM IN A HOSPITAL BED WITH THE OXYGEN AND EVERYTH- AND HE WAS DYING AND HE LOOKED TERRIBLE AND IT WAS IT  (fe_03_06319-B-0049)
WAS LIKE I DON'T YOU'RE PROBABLY TOO YOUNG FOR THIS BUT YUL BRYNNER ALSO DID THESE COMMERCIALS AND THAT WAS VERY POWERFUL TO SEE OH THAT'S WHAT SMOKING DOES  (fe_03_06319-B-0050)
MHM  (fe_03_06319-B-0051)
YEAH IT IT'S WELL LIKE I SAID IN  (fe_03_06319-B-0052)
UM IF YOU HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE SAYING THAT IT IS A COOL THING LIKE IN THE MOVIES OR IN THE INDUSTRY OR LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING ABOUT THE PATIO SO MUCH MONEY IS BEING PUT INTO CREATING A SMOKE SPOT  (fe_03_06319-B-0053)
YOU KNOW FOR FOR THESE PEOPLE THEN IT IT'S CONSIDERED A COOL THING IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A SICKNESS IT'S NOT CONSIDERED AN ADDICTION IT'S CONSIDERED A COOL THING  (fe_03_06319-B-0054)
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES WANT IS THAT IMAGE  (fe_03_06319-B-0055)
SO NO I WAS JUST GONG TO SAY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE CIGARETTE COMPANIES SHOULD BE THE ONES PAYING FOR THE VENTILATION SYSTEMS AND WHATEVER WOULD BE HELPFUL  (fe_03_06319-B-0056)
IN THESE PUBLIC PLACES SO THAT THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T SMOKE DON'T HAVE TO INHALE THE SMOKE  (fe_03_06319-B-0057)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06319-B-0058)
AND IT'S ALSO IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT UM I THINK IT WAS ON SIXTY MINUTES NOT TOO LONG AGO MAYBE A YEAR OR SO AGO UM THEY WERE SHOWING THE FARMERS THE TOBACCO FARMERS IN THE SOUTH WHO  (fe_03_06319-B-0059)
MAY OR MAY NOT SMOKE THEMSELVES BUT THEIR FAMILIES DEPEND ON SELLING THESE TOBACCO LEAVES  (fe_03_06319-B-0060)
AND IF IF CIGARETTE COMPANIES STOP MAKING THE AMOUNT OF CIGARETTES THAT THEY DID THEN THESE FAMILY FARMS WOULD GO UNDER  (fe_03_06319-B-0061)
YOU KNOW SO THAT WAS THAT WAS LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOR ME IT WAS SEEING KIND OF THE THE HUMAN INTEREST PART OF OH THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT PRODUCE THE THAT YOU KNOW THEIR LIVES ARE REALLY AFFECTED I B- BUT I JUST DON'T THINK  (fe_03_06319-B-0062)
I'M VERY UM OPPOSED TO SMOKING  (fe_03_06319-B-0063)
YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE IT AS A GOOD THING SO IT'S IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GIVE THAT SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT ANY KIND OF POINTS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO SUCH A TERRIBLE HABIT  (fe_03_06319-B-0064)
YEAH AND THEN HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IF YOU BAN SMOKING WHAT COULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT  (fe_03_06319-B-0065)
YEAH  (fe_03_06319-B-0066)
