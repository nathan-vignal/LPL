I AGREE I AM AN OCCASIONAL SMOKER UM MOSTLY WHEN I'M REALLY BUSY OR WHEN I'M BEING SOCIAL UM AROUND OTHER SMOKERS  (fe_03_06373-B-0004)
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES WHERE SMOKING WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE PUBLICALLY SAY LIKE A BAR WHERE SMOKING IS ALLOWED  (fe_03_06373-B-0005)
OR THINGS LIKE THAT BUT IN THE MAJORITY OF PUBLIC PLACES I I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT UM I PROBABLY SMOKE MAYBE FIVE CIGARETTES A MONTH  (fe_03_06373-B-0006)

UM  (fe_03_06373-B-0018)
[LIPSMACK] BUT LET'S SEE WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE ADS  (fe_03_06373-B-0019)
YEAH I I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD ADS OUT THERE  (fe_03_06373-B-0020)
UM DESIGNED TO EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC  (fe_03_06373-B-0021)
AGAINST SMOKING I LIKE THE RED CURTAIN ADS A LOT  (fe_03_06373-B-0022)

THEY'RE  (fe_03_06373-B-0028)
REALLY EDUCATIONAL THEY THEY DO LITTLE  (fe_03_06373-B-0029)
BITS FROM  (fe_03_06373-B-0030)

UM  (fe_03_06373-B-0032)
THE I GUESS THE AUDIENCE THAT IS INCREASING IN USE SO THAT'S NICE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE USING RESEARCH TO ACTUALLY  (fe_03_06373-B-0033)
FOCUS ON THAT GROUP AND AND STUFF LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06373-B-0034)
MHM  (fe_03_06373-B-0035)
YEAH IT'S THE UM  (fe_03_06373-B-0036)
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOUNG TEENS ARE SMOKING SO MUCH AND DEFINITELY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06373-B-0037)
MY PARENTS' GENERATION AND MY GRANDPARENTS' GENERATION  (fe_03_06373-B-0038)
HAVE CEASED DOING SO  (fe_03_06373-B-0039)
IN IN LARGE NUMBERS BUT THE UM BUT CLUB GOERS THESE DAYS IT'S KIND OF A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06373-B-0040)

THOSE ARE EASY TO PICK UP  (fe_03_06373-B-0042)
YEAH  (fe_03_06373-B-0043)
IT MAKES YOU MORE PRONE TO ASTHMA AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS  (fe_03_06373-B-0044)
IT'S HARD ENOUGH WITH ALL THE OTHER POLLUTANTS THAT  (fe_03_06373-B-0045)
I DON'T KNOW I STILL THINK IT'S A IT'S A MATTER OF CHOICE THOUGH IN A LOT OF WAYS I LIKE THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND ADVERTISEMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE BECAUSE IT MAKES THE PUBLIC MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THIS THIS IT WH-  (fe_03_06373-B-0046)
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU  (fe_03_06373-B-0047)
SO CHOOSE WISELY AND  (fe_03_06373-B-0048)
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY  (fe_03_06373-B-0049)
EVEN  (fe_03_06373-B-0050)
IF I'M GOING TO BE REALLY BUSY I PROBABLY ONLY SMOKE LIKE ONE CIGARETTE IN A WEEK  (fe_03_06373-B-0051)
OR YOU KNOW IF I HAVE JUST A MASSIVE DEADLINE AND THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE I MIGHT YOU KNOW STEP OUT FOR A CIGARETTE WITH SOMEONE  (fe_03_06373-B-0052)
A COUPLE OF TIMES A DAY  (fe_03_06373-B-0053)
BUT I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW GOING OUT AND BUYING A PACK OF CIGARETTES AND SMOKING ALL THE CIGARETTES 'CAUSE ONE THEY MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT NAUSEOUS  (fe_03_06373-B-0054)
[LAUGHTER] IF YOU DON'T SMOKE ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_06373-B-0055)
AND TWO IT JUST IT TASTES NASTY IT SMELLS NASTY BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU JUST KIND OF  (fe_03_06373-B-0056)
WANT THAT RELIEF I GUESS  (fe_03_06373-B-0057)
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL THEY PROBABLY COST LIKE  (fe_03_06373-B-0060)
A DOLLAR AND SOME CHANGE IF THAT AND THOSE WERE LIKE THE GOOD CIGARETTES  (fe_03_06373-B-0061)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06373-B-0062)
AND I THINK THE LAST TIME MY FIANCE BOUGHT CIGARETTES THEY WERE OVER THREE DOLLARS  (fe_03_06373-B-0063)
WHICH IS I MEAN IT'S  (fe_03_06373-B-0064)
BEEN A FEW YEARS IT'S BEEN YOU KNOW TEN YEARS SINCE I STARTED COLLEGE BUT UH THAT'S A LOT OF INCREASE IN TEN YEARS  (fe_03_06373-B-0065)
IT'S JUST AMAZING  (fe_03_06373-B-0066)
I THINK SO IT WAS WHETHER OR NOT SMOKING SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN PUBLIC PLACES AND THEN WHETHER OR NOT  (fe_03_06373-B-0067)
ADVERTISEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WERE A GOOD IDEA SOMETHING  (fe_03_06373-B-0068)
LIKE THAT I THINK SO THERE ARE SO MANY MESSAGES THOUGH I WONDER IF THEY GET CONFUSED LIKE YOU SAID TUNING THEM OUT  (fe_03_06373-B-0069)
YEAH  (fe_03_06373-B-0070)
I WOULD HOPE NOT I MEAN UNLESS YOU'RE BURYING YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE CONSTANTLY TELLING YOU I MEAN SCHOOL CHILDREN GO UP TO THEIR PARENTS AND SAY YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT [LAUGHTER] SO HOW CAN THEY BE OBLIVIOUS  (fe_03_06373-B-0071)
MHM  (fe_03_06373-B-0072)

WHICH YOU KNOW EVEN TO THE MOST OBSTINATE  (fe_03_06373-B-0074)
OSTRICH SHOULD PROVE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE LIABLE FOR ENDANGERING  (fe_03_06373-B-0075)
YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S HEALTH WITHOUT LETTING THEM KNOW  (fe_03_06373-B-0076)
YEAH I WONDER HOW MUCH OF IT THEY'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN  (fe_03_06373-B-0078)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06373-B-0079)
IT'S LIKE HOW MANY APPEALS DO THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06373-B-0080)
GET TO FUND THEIR OWN RESEARCH STUDY OR  (fe_03_06373-B-0081)
YOU KNOW HEALTH PREVENTION FOUNDATION OR  (fe_03_06373-B-0082)
SOMETHING LIKE THAT I'M SURE SOME OF THESE ADS ARE  (fe_03_06373-B-0083)
GENERATED BY  (fe_03_06373-B-0084)
MONEY FROM LAW SUITS  (fe_03_06373-B-0085)
BUT  (fe_03_06373-B-0086)
MHM  (fe_03_06373-B-0087)

SO I THINK IT'S UNDERSTOOD  (fe_03_06373-B-0093)
BY THE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO SMOKE THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS THEIR CHOICE THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN TO DO THAT AND THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO HAVE THAT AROUND SO  (fe_03_06373-B-0094)
