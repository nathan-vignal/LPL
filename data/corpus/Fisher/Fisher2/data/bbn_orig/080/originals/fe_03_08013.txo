L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my -- my name is Neil.  What's your name?
L:  Uh, Fong[?].
R:  What's your name?
L:  Fong.
R:  Fong?  How you doing Fong?
L:  I'm good, how are you?
R:  Doing good, I guess.  So, uh, do you like going to the movies?
L:  Uh, yeah, I do. [LAUGH]
R:  W- -- uh, where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm San Diego.
R:  San Diego?  Yeah, I'm from California too.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but I'm f- -- yeah, I'm Boston right now, but --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, yeah, what was the last movie you saw?
R:  I saw Old School.
L:  Oh, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  W- -- a- are you in college?
L:  Um, no, I'm in grad school, so --
R:  In grad school?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I watched it on my computer.  I -- I usually download movies now.  Is that what you do too?
L:  Oh, you do?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um --
R:  Yeah, so, like --
L:  -- so you don't go to the movie theaters anymore or something?
R:  I do.  I -- I -- I do like -- now and then I go into, like, a movie but it's, like, really expensive now.
L:  Oh, well, which part of California are you from?
R:  Orange County.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Uh --
R:  Yeah, i- i- it's, like, seven -- like, it's eight bucks for a movie.
L:  Oh, it's more expensive in San Diego, I think, than that.
R:  Really?  Yeah, well, I mean, like, I remember when they used to be, like, five bucks but I guess it just, you know, for, like -- if it's a -- like it might be a shitty movie and you pay eight bucks for it, so might as well just, like, download and watch it and see if it's good or not, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, like, the last movie I saw in the theater I think was, um, was it ... uh, I think it was the Hulk.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And it was pretty crappy, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I wasted eight bucks on it, yeah.  So ...
L:  Uh, okay.  I think the last one I saw in the movie theaters was Hulk as well.
R:  The Hulk too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, see, uh, i- i- it seemed like -- it seemed too fake, like, uh --
L:  Oh, 'cause of the --
R:  -- the visual part of it.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  Like -- it was, like, it was mostly all like CG --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what I kinda thought.
L:  Yeah, I don't know, 'cause, uh, w- -- um, [LIPSMACK] what was it?  Superman had a lot of CG in it too, right?  Did you see that one?
R:  S- -- y- you mean Spiderman or Superman?
L:  Yeah, that was it.  Spiderman, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, yeah, but some parts seemed so fake, like when --
L:  It looked fake to me.
R:  -- he was going through the building and stuff.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, he -- it seemed like that's kinda -- that's why -- yeah, but [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, did you watch, um, the Matrix?
R:  No, I haven't seen the Matrix yet.  Uh, uh, I see --
L:  Oh, you haven't?  Wow.
R:  That's a movie I wanted to watch in the theater, but I never got a chance to go --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I still haven't seen it.  But I'll probably end up downloading it now, [MN] just collect it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, when you download right now, like, um, is it, like, uh, pirated or is it good quality?
R:  Yeah, it's -- yeah, most of the movies you get are -- are -- are pirated, but, like -- like nowadays, like, the companies, the- they release DVD screeners of 'em, like, for other people to -- for, like, critics to check out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So people, like, steal 'em and they put in there, so it's DVD quality, most of 'em.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah, so, like, instead of renting it, if you can get a DVD quality it's, like -- it's, like, well, right now, I'm downloading, like, five movies on the computer, you -- you just sit there and download all the other stuff.
L:  Oh, so you definitely don't go rent movies now?
R:  Well, actually I do, like, before, like, uh -- I just got cable, like, a month ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I used to go rent, like, four movies a week, yeah, 'cause it's kind of boring over the summer.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But n- now, since I have that, I just download movies.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  'Cause, yeah, 'cause, I mean, if you can download it in a day, you know, you can just download it instead of going over to the store --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to get it.  But I -- I still rent movies now and then too, uh, you know, like, once every two weeks.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, how -- do you -- do you rent movies often, or are you busy with school?
L:  Uh, I don't rent, because, like, it's kinda far away, like, uh, 'cause I live in Boston right now, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the Block- -- well, the Blockbuster store is, like -- well, I'm really used to driving, since I'm from California [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm, like, I don't really go out too often, 'cause I don't have a car.
R:  Oh, that sucks.
L:  But the Blockbuster's sort of far away and then, um, I live on campus, so they have, like, free videos, so I watch those.
R:  Oh, yes, yeah, y- y- you can get movies from, like, you know, your library, right? [MN]
L:  Yeah, stuff like that, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I --
L:  So --
R:  -- I used to do that too.  I -- I, uh, I, uh, go to UT and so, uh, I was -- I just -- I realized that, like, the school has all these movies you can check out for free.  I never knew that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So -- and then, like, uh, actually going to a movie here is really expensive too, because, like, um, I w- -- it costs, like, ten bucks --
R:  Oh, shit.
L:  -- but then I also have to pay for, like, the transportation into the -- like, to go see the movie, 'cause there's, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they don't have movie theaters, like, in a lot of places, so, yeah, it's pretty expensive, so I don't really go -- so, usually I go when I go back to San Diego.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I watch movies when I'm there.
R:  Well, what school do you go to, [inaudible]?
L:  Uh, I go to MIT.
R:  MIT?  Really?  Oh, w- what year are you?
L:  Oh, I'm just a first year grad student.
R:  First year grad student?  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  W- w- -- uh, well, my friend actually goes to MIT too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know if you'd know him, Timmy Tapisanui[?].
L:  What?
R:  Uh, his name -- h- his name is Timmy Tapisanui --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  -- if that rings a bell.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, just -- just in case you might know.
L:  No, no. [LAUGH] I don't.
R:  Yeah, he -- he used to be on the football team but he quit because he -- the team sucked.
L:  Ah.
R:  He couldn't stand it any more.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I don't know about the MIT football team.  I didn't know they had one.
R:  Yeah, he -- like, he was playing there and, like, there'd be people playing in -- and, like, a little kid playing in the end zone.  He was, like, "I can't take this anymore".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He -- he just quit.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like, it was just too demeaning to the sport of football.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Oh, so what did you think of the movie Old School?  My brother really liked it.
R:  I thought it was pretty funny, actually.  Um, it wasn't super funny, but it was -- it was all right, it wasn't that funny.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so --
L:  'Cause it seems like all the guys like it, so I --
R:  Yeah, it -- yeah, it's a -- more of a guy -- I don't think any girls like it. [LAUGH] It's, like, all about, like -- like using girls and shit like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Ha- have you seen it?
L:  Yeah, I saw it [SIGH] --
R:  Did you -- did you like it or did you --
L:  -- like, last week.
R:  What did you think of it?
L:  I thought it was okay.  It was not that funny, like, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but because, uh, the people here, they're always quoting lines out of that movie, so I thought it was really funny, but it's not --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that great.
R:  I- it's -- it's already -- it's already, like, a cult status over there?   People are quoting lines from it?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I thought it was o- -- I didn't think it was, like, the greatest movie.  I mean, it, uh, yeah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was just a few laughs and that here and there.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it wasn't that funny.
R:  Yeah, I think -- it's mostly just Will Farrell is the funniest guy.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- brings life in any movie.
L:  What?
R:  He -- he -- he -- he brings life into any movie, like, he makes any movie funny, whatever movie he's in.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, whatever it is.  What's a -- what's a- another movie you wanna see that you haven't seen yet?
L:  I don't know what's out right now, I'm --
R:  Pretty busy?
L:  -- I don't pay atten- -- yeah.  Uh, let's see, [SIGH] so, what's a w- --
R:  Have you seen Harry Potter?
L:  What?
R:  Have you seen Harry Potter Two?
L:  Yeah, I saw that one.
R:  What did you think of that?
L:  It's okay.  Harry Potter --
R:  Okay?
L:  -- is kind of, like, too long for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- that -- I was surprised the movie was so long, it was, like, three hours long.
L:  Yeah, I was amazed, 'cause -- and it's kind of -- I don't know, too kiddyish for me.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Uh -- oh, so what's the worst movie you've ever seen?
R:  Worst movie?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Probably either Scream Three or The Fan.
L:  The Fan?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What is that?
R:  It's, with, um, who is it?  It's with, uh, with some crappy ass movie.  Actually, it had two big stars in it.  Or -- or -- or -- what --
L:  Really?
R:  -- what's the -- what's the guy from the Blade, the black guy, what was his name?  Uh, Wesley Snipes.
L:  Wesley Snipes?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, Wesley Snipes was in there, and just some other guy was in there, i- -- uh, no, it wasn't Al Pacino, it was, uh, who's the guy from, uh, Meet the Parents?  The -- the father?
L:  Uh, oh God, [LAUGH] I always forget his name, 'cause he's always, like, uh --
R:  Yeah, he --
L:  -- Robert De Niro.
R:  Yeah, Robert De Niro.  It was him and Wesley Snipes and, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Robert De Niro's a crazed fan or something and he's -- he's -- I don't know, Wesley Snipes is a baseball player.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was the most worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life.
L:  Is that an old movie?  I've never even heard of it.
R:  It -- it's probably, like, ninety ninety two, I think --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- ninety three.
L:  That's really old.
R:  Yeah.  So, I remem- -- I remember that, and the Scream Three was as bad.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Have you seen Scream Three?
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  Yeah, so I -- I watched, like, halfway and I fell asleep 'cause it was so bad.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, okay.
R:  Well, yeah, well, what's the worst movie you've seen?
L:  Um, this one called Mr. Wrong, with --
R:  Mr. Wrong?
L:  -- like, Ellen DeGeneres in it and it was like --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I had rented it, um, from, like, Blockbuster or whatever, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it was so bad, 'cause I was, like -- and then, it's, like, the first movie at home that I've walked out on. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah, it's really a bad movie.
R:  I guess everyone's wrong for, uh, Ellen D- -- Ellen DeGeneres, 'cause she's a lesbian.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  There's -- there is no Mr. Right.
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  There is no Mr. Right for her.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, yeah.  At the time, we didn't know, but, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, that's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  That's cool.  So, what else is there?  Uh, what other movies, uh, ha- have you seen the Matrix?  I'm assuming the -- the first Matrix, have you seen that?
L:  Yeah, I saw that, yeah.
R:  Yeah, have you seen, uh, the second one too?
L:  Yeah, I saw the second one.
R:  W- what did you think of it?  I haven't seen it yet, so p- -- some people say they like it, some people say that it wasn't -- it wasn't that good, it wasn't as good as the first one.
L:  Well, um, the thing is, I was getting bored with all the fight scenes --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- 'cause it's not -- I mean, you -- 'cause you think, like, why he can't he just leave, 'cause they always end up leaving, right?  'Cause there's no way you could kill them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so what's the point of all this fighting?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then, um, and then, like, some -- some fights looked really fake, 'cause it's all CG, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, um --
R:  L- l- like that one part in the commercial, like I saw he was fighting, like, fifty of the clones or whatever --
L:  Yeah, yeah, that part was really fake, like, it was really fake.
R:  Yeah, it seems like in the commercial too, and they're, like, a- all bending and flying and everywhere.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and then, um, let's see, I mean, there's a lot of, like, philosophy, I guess, or just gibberish --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when they talk about, you know, whatever.  But, I mean, you could basically ignore all those parts and still be okay with the movie.  Like, I was -- I liked it.
R:  Liked it?
L:  I mean, it wasn't, like -- some people think it's l- -- it was, like, too complicated because of all the, like, extra talk that they put in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, overall I thought it was good.
R:  I like complicated movies, uh, overall too, like, ones that make you use your head, kind of.
