L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Janice.
L:  [NOISE] I'm Lisa, nice to meet you.
R:  Hi Lisa.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  How are you doing today?
L:  [NOISE] I'm good.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing good.
L:  [NOISE] Great.
R:  So, do you like computer games?
L:  [NOISE] I love 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I love 'em.
R:  Yeah, they're a little addicting.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Well yeah, ah, yeah they are, you're right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know when I first started, um, yeah, I would spend hours [COUGH] and I'd look at the clock, I'm like, "Oh my god --"
L:  [NOISE] I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- what have I been doing?  [LAUGH] What have I been doing?"
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, which ones do you play?
R:  Ah, well, I play on AOL --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- I play, um -- I play Pop It --
L:  [NOISE] I like that.
R:  -- and Word Whomp is probably my favorite.  [LAUGH]
L:  I like that one too.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think I'm learning something actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I play that game.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah, 'cause it's come up with words that you've like, "What?  What was that?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's why I try to tell myself, "Maybe I'm learning something when I play this game".
L:  I know.
R:  Ah, what else do I like, it's d- -- I haven't played for a while --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] just but -- 'cause I've been doing other things, but, um, when I was real heavy into it I played, um, [LIPSMACK] what is that bumblebee one too, I can't -- Bumble Words or --
L:  Yeah, Bum- -- yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I'm not sure what the name of it is.
L:  I played that, I can't remember, I think it's, um, Bumblebee something, I can't remember.
R:  Yeah, but I don't --
L:  And I play that one, now that one is very addictive.
R:  Yeah, those are probably my -- my three favorite ones that I played on a regular basis.
L:  Have you ever played, ah, Mah- Mahjong?
R:  No, I haven't.  I played it, ah, I used to play with my Grandma a long time ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I haven't played it on the computer.
L:  I like that, I love that.
R:  Do you, yeah, she said she likes that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I think I'd have to go through the rules and everything to relearn how to play it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, now that -- that's addicting as well.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  That is very addicting, I can stay on the computer for hours playing that one.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Sometimes if I'm in a gambling mood I'll play twenty one [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], yeah, oh yeah.
R:  -- but, um, this -- those little slot things, they all, I don't know, they just don't do it for me.
L:  I know, I play them sometimes, it's just like boring.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, like, ah, "This is not like the real thing [LIPSMACK] --"
L:  I know.
R:  I'll go to something else".  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I've also played that one, um, I'm not sure the name of it is but you, I don't even know what you do, all I know is you click and if you don't click on a bomb you're okay, do you know which one I'm talking about?
L:  Oh, is that Mine -- Mine Sweep --
R:  Yeah, Mine Sweep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't even know how to win that game, I just don't --
L:  I don't -- I know -- I don't like that little game.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I just know you're just not supposed to get the, ah, the mines and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then you're fine and, but I don't know how you win, I don't --
L:  'Cause I think, it's somehow you have to, like, um, put a flag on something, like where you think the bomb is at or something --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then, I don't know, I don't -- I don't like that 'cause it's like, you win one level and then the next level you go to, the bombs just explode.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, oh, you know what, I forgot of one I just remembered of, my cousin got it from, um, Yahoo, it's called, um, [LIPSMACK] oh my god, it has a weird name, Exceleron[?] or, it's got like, all these different levels and, um, it's like a, um, there's different symbols and have different colors and you try to, um, [LIPSMACK] put 'em together to build things, ex- -- it's call- -- 
L:  Oh, is that Tetris [NOISE]?
R:  -- how I wish I -- no, it's not Tetris, it's called Exceleron or something.
L:  I don't know.  [NOISE]
R:  It's really -- it's kind of like Tetris, um --
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] but I know I had it for, like, a membership thing for thirty days free and I played it and then the thirty days was up and, I'm like, "I don't want to pay for this".
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  [NOISE]
R:  And then my cousin got it for me again.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I can't -- oh, I wish I could remember the name of that.
L:  I don't know, um, I don't know -- [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] But yeah, I like that one, once I -- I usually tend to play one game at a time --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- for a long time, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until I get bored of it and then and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'll try something else, but, um -- but, yeah, I think Word Whomp has to be my favorite.
L:  I like that one too.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I'm always trying to reach for the carrots.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Come on, come on, I want it".  I like watching my points build up too.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, definitely, yeah, I like [NOISE]--
R:  Yeah, I think I had -- I had a lot and then I decided, "Okay, I'll do the little, um, [LIPSMACK] lottery thing or whatever, you know, buy the tickets or whatever" --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, of course I never win anything on it, you know.
L:  I know, I don't know why they do that.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think I just want to watch it grow.
L:  Yeah, that's what I --
R:  But --
L:  -- usually do too.  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, I haven't, um, [LIPSMACK] but I haven't played in a while so, been away.  Have you ever, like, bought the games at like Best Buy and then tried to put them on your computer that way and --
L:  Yeah, I've done, um, I've done Mahjong like that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I did that one and, um, [LIPSMACK] I got, ah, my daughter loves Tetris so I got that one and, um, Pacman 'cause I love Pacman too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's just like a oldie but goody, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm trying to think what else that I bought another one, I can't remember the name of it, but yeah, I got that, um, I did that from Best Buy.
R:  Yeah, I did one called, ah, Fast Food Tycoon.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, but I cou- -- I -- I downloaded it and everything but then it told me I -- it wasn't playable on my computer, so I don't know.  I was really disappointed 'cause it looked like fun.
L:  How long did you have it before it was -- said it wasn't playable?
R:  I never got to use it, it just --
L:  Oh, did you not take it back?
R:  No, because I'd already downloaded and opened the box and everything, I don't know -- I didn't know is they'd take it back, so I just wrote it off.
L:  Oh, I would have at least called them and said, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because some- sometime it -- it m- -- could have been a bad copy, you know, 'cause I can --
R:  No, I think it -- I think, um, it just -- I wasn't -- my computer wasn't pa- compatible with it, you had to have like --
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  -- a certain, um, program to run it or something --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I didn't have that program so.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, 'cause sometimes that happens too.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think that was my fault --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it looked like fun, I wanted to play it.
L:  It sounds like fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you, like, build like a fast food restaurant and you get to --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  pick what you want to serve and, you know, all that kind of stuff so.
L:  Oh, yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun.
R:  Yeah, I like food so I'm, like, oh, that'd be cool.  [LAUGH]
L:  And you take out that, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I'd take out that, yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] and I think what I'd -- the last game that I've came across, um -- have you ever played, like, Poker and, um, Spades and stuff like that online?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah, they have -- I have one computer game that I bought that has like the dealer there --
L:  Mm, mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  --you know, and it, like, deals you the cards and you're sitting with other players.
L:  Oh, cool.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, my dad plays that a lot, um --
L:  [NOISE] Oh really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you know, we all like to gamble.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Um, but I just, ah, yeah, I don't really care for that that much.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I'm not good at that kind of stuff, so.
L:  I know.  Have you played Bingo online?  [NOISE]
R:  No, I've never played Bingo online.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  It has so many sites for bingo online, I, um --
R:  Really?
L:  -- [NOISE] I'm -- I'm -- I have MSN and Earthlink [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and MSN, um, has this site where they play Bingo and all.  I signed up for it last night but I haven't played it yet.  [NOISE]
R:  Wow --
L:  Um.
R:  -- my mom goes every Sunday.
L:  Oh really?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and I've gone with -- my mom's gone probably for about fifteen years, um, and I've gone with her, you know, I go like, maybe like five to six times a year and I have yet to win, ha, and my mom wins a lot.
L:  Well, you need to -- really?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you should tell her to l- -- go online 'cause they win money on there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Do you have to pay to use it though?
L:  Uh-uh, no, it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- free, yeah, she w- -- ah, you can win money online.  [NOISE]
R:  And you get it through MSN?
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, wow, I'll have to try that, maybe I can win that way.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I still can't win in person, that's for sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  I've never actually gone in person but I've always wanted to, 'cause I'm [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, it's a lot of fun but, um, if you have somebody that knows how to play it's a lot easier because, ah, th- -- it's not -- just not like regular Bingo anymore, there's like so many different games and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if you yell Bingo and you don't have it those old ladies will be pissed at you.
L:  Oh, I guess.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  They yell and scream.  [LAUGH] They're not nice at all, geez.
L:  I know.  [NOISE]
R:  I'll have to try that.  I didn't know they had Bingo online.
L:  Yeah, they have Bingo online.  [NOISE]
R:  Wow.
L:  I see it -- it always pops up when I'm about to check my emails.  I'm, like, I'm going to sign up and I did but I haven't played it yet, I said I may go in tonight and try.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh yeah, that'd be cool.
L:  See what happens.  [NOISE]
R:  And then now that we're talking about it I think I'm going go have to play Word Whomp tonight.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I love that game.
R:  It's been a while.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, I love that game --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's amazing the words they come up with it, they're like, "That's not a word". [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.  I try to keep the dictionary right next me in case --
L:  That's what I've been doing, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm like -- [MN] I'm like, "Oh my god, okay, okay --"
L:  [MN] [NOISE].
R:  -- what is it?  What is it?"  And then --"
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- sometimes I'm like, "Oh my god, how come I could not get that?"
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] "How come I could not get that?  What's wrong with me?"
L:  Exactly.  [COUGH] Or if you know it's the word and you got the two, like the A and the R or the U and the A and the R spelt [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- wrong and it's like, "Well, I know this is the word but something is wrong here".  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and then with like, um, with the bumblebee one --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I always try to get the bonus.  I can never get that bonus word.  [LAUGH]
L:  I've th- -- I've got the bonus and I've got plenty of jackpots --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- 'cause I haven't got, ah -- but I can't -- I don't know how they win the, um, jackpot, I don't know how they do it.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah I don't know how they do that either.
L:  Don't know how they do it.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know what the deal is with that.
L:  'Cause it gets up way high and, I mean, you get, I think they said you have to get jackpots [inaudible] and I've gotten those but I haven't won the, um, the -- the jackpot.    [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think it's just if the jackpot's [inaudible] lands on jackpot is what you win.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  I -- 'cause I've seen it come up --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- you have a really fast go when it starts --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you'll see jackpot, excuse me, you'll see jackpot in there and I've seen that come up so I think that's what it is, is when you're in the jackpot spin and it lands on jackpot is when you win the jackpot.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I have, um, I've yet to -- to see anybody win it so.
L:  I know it was on one night and it, um, and the jackpot disappeared and I'm like, "Well, did somebody just win the jackpot?"  It's just like, they don't tell you, you know, so and so just won the jackpot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just l- -- you look and the money is gone and it's like, "Okay, what just happened here?"
R:  Yeah, so somebody must of won.
L:  Yeah, yeah, but it's --
R:  'Cause I s- -- yeah, I see it change a lot.
L:  Yeah, it does, it does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It does, and Netscape, um, I go on there sometimes, they have a lot of games on there too. 
R:  Oh, do they?
L:  Mhm, they have a lot of good games.
R:  Yeah, I just got DSL so, ah --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh yeah.
R:  -- I have to see what I got and I use it through Internet Explorer so I'll have to check and see what they have.
L:  Yeah, just go, [inaudible], I just go around to different sites and see [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- see what different games they have 'cause I love that, um, have you tried Textwist[?]?
R:  No, what's that?
L:  That's another word game too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It gives you like a bunch of letters and you can scramble the letters and come up with the -- like a bunch of different words.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's on -- where's that at -- that --
