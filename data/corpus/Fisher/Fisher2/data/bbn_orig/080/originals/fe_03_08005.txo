L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, hi, Pam.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm okay, how are you?  What's the last movie you saw?
L:  [LAUGH] Believe it or not, Cinderella, last night, starring Lesley Ann Warren, do you remember that movie?
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] I believe --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I do, I believe I do.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, we pulled it off the shelves, and I was really surprised that I actually remembered the song.  Do -- what was the last movie you saw?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] Frida, I believe.  I --
L:  Frida?
R:  Yeah, I saw it with my daughter, um, [LIPSMACK] she wanted to go.
L:  So, you go out to the theater quite --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- a bit?
R:  [SIGH] Well, not as much as I'd like. [LAUGH] We -- I do rent more movies then the theater, yes.
L:  Do you?  Yes, we definitely rent a lot more movies and we own a ton of movies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, it's real easy to, you know, stay at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- home and if we don't rent one of the new ones, like we used to, I would really like to see The Incredible Hulk, though I've heard it's getting -- my son went to see it and he said it was not very good.
R:  Yeah, the review I saw was, um, was a mediocre.
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN]
L:  Too schlocky.
R:  Yeah.  So, do you watch, uh, videos at home with your family?
L:  Yes, we usually do.  Yes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we have a lot of movie channels also that we select from.
R:  Uh-huh.  And children watch it with you?
L:  My children are twenty three and eighteen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes, how old are your children?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] the youngest is, uh, uh, twenty --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- twenty eight and then the, uh, I have three in the thirties.
L:  Oh, so you're an older parent also.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, you know, I still enjoy watching, um, some of the chi- childhood movies that my children watched, like, um, The Little Rascals, I really like to pull that movie down quite and watch that one.
R:  Yeah.  Well, [MN] in all of our family the, uh, favorite of all time is Amadeus.
L:  Is Amadeus, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where -- where do you live at, Robert?
R:  In Chicago.
L:  Oh, in Chicago, well, I live in Michigan.
R:  Uh-huh.  What --
L:  I'm not too far --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from you.
R:  Near where?
L:  I am in, [LAUGH] actually at the border of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- there's a little county there, Hillsdo[?] County.
R:  That's not too far from where I grew up, was born and grew up.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Where did you grow up at?
R:  In northwestern Ohio, uh --
L:  What town?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] have you heard of Ottowa?
L:  Yes, I sure have.  Have you ever heard of Bryan, Ohio?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I --
L:  Okay, that's where we lived for over twenty years. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yes. [LIPSMACK] Now --
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  -- when my children --
R:  -- I -- I drive through --
L:  -- when my children --
R:  -- there a lot, g- I'm sorry.
L:  Pardon?
R:  I drive through there a lot coming to Chicago.
L:  Do you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Down through Bryan?
R:  Right.
L:  It's a -- it's a nice little town.
R:  Right.  It's not quite about the movies, is it?  But, uh --
L:  Uh, no, no --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was just going to say, when -- when my boys were little and I was raising them in Bryan --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we went to the theater a lot.  We lived very close to downtown and we walked down a lot, you know, and I took them a lot to the Saturday shows to see them.  I had more time, you know, they wanted to go and we had a lot of fun going to the shows and the drive ins, you know, I remember taking my boys to --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- the drive in theaters.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  You know, there is one drive in theater still left up here in Coldwater --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's open.
R:  I don't know of any, uh, in my experience, you know, me -- where I used to go.
L:  Yes, do you remember going to the drive in theaters?
R:  Di- I -- oh -- oh yeah, I went to the drive in when I was a young guy.  A --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- a lot --
L:  -- those were a lot of fun.
R:  -- a lot, but they were big in small towns, you know?
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  But -- but, uh, contemporaneously, my daughter, uh, my youngest daughter is a, uh, theater student, uh --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- yeah, she's, uh, in the conservatory at, uh, De Paul University.
L: Wha- very good.
R:  And, uh, so --
L:  Very good.
R:  -- so, we're big fans of live theater and, uh, and the- and we saw a lot of plays this year, the -- many of which she was in as a student, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we've seen [inaudible] fewer movies, but, uh, but we d- we do watch quite a few on -- on, you know, sitting at home.
L:  I'm a -- a channel flipper and -- but I do like to watch the movies that are on, um, the two -- the True Channel and I like to watch the old movies that are on AMC.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I really do.  I'm not much one -- usually the guys will pop in a movie and ask me if I want to watch it, I'm more content doing other things, really, than sitting down and watching a movie.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I like the old classics, uh --
L:  Oh, I do too.  Um, my grandmother always bought us some old -- I have some old slapstick videos also with, um, like Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin and, you know, the things that were -- that were popular when I was younger --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I was a little girl.
R:  What's the best movie you've seen in the last year?
L:  The last year, the best movie I saw, [LIPSMACK] that I don't know.  What was the best movie you saw?
R:  Huh, I'm stuck too, I [MN] I like -- uh, we saw Amadeus again on -- on -- on DVD, uh, about a month ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, that's one of my favorites, I -- I really like the seriousness of the script.
L:  Well, my guys are really into the action movie, so we have a lot of action films --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I'm -- I'm the only female in my house --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so, you know, the guys kind of rule the TV and that's fine with me, like, we have all the Bruce Lee movies and we have all the, um, oh, Bruce Willis movies and, you know, all the action movies -- oh, my favorite movie, I know what it is.  Shawshank Redemption.  That is an excellent, excellent movie.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I've seen it, uh, at least twice on tape. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I know I've seen it more than twice, we do -- there's something about that movie, the way that it was written and I really, really like Morgan Freeman as an actor, I think he is an excellent actor and I enjoy just about all the movies he's been in.
R:  Well, Tim Robbins was good in that, too.
L:  Yes, Tim Robbins was very good in that movie, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was quite a -- you know the first time I saw it I was very surprised.  What was the other movie that was filmed, um, I believe in Chicago, it was with Richard Gere and Ed Norton.  What was that movie?
R:  With Tim Robbins?
L:  No, with Ed Norton.
R:  Oh, [SIGH] I can't, uh, I can't think of it at the moment.
L:  Well, he -- he -- till he takes everyone out, you know, it's, like, really a thriller movie and it -- it, boy that was quite the shocker.  The ending of that movie, I like the way that they wrote it, because it -- usually, you know, you walk out of the theater, you w- watch the movie and the endings aren't what you want them to be --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and my problem too, is, um, I read a lot of books and I don't like it when they take a book and make it into a movie unless they do an excellent job with it, you know, like Shawshank Redemption it -- the actual story is only, you know, like, maybe thirty pages, it's just a very short story --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the original Shawshank Redemption.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, and, um, [LIPSMACK] I was -- I was very moved by the way that they actually took that and made it into such, you know, they really expanded on all of the characters, which you didn't get in the short story --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it was just -- it was kinda blah, the short story, actually.
R:  So, in this case the movie might've been better than the story.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, yes, it definitely was, which is very surprising, because I don't like -- like it when they take a really, really good book, something that I really enjoyed and they, um, don't make it what it -- what it really was.  Oh, which was -- it was, um, not Dune two[?], shoot.  Who wrote -- do you remember the movie that starred Tom Cruise and he was the lawyer?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] was it Phil- was it the Philadelphia --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Story, or something like that?  Uh, no, that wha- that was not Tom Cruise, that was, uh, another actor whose name I can't remember.  No, I -- uh, no I don't remember.  That wasn't the one with Jack Nicholson on -- when Jack Nicholson was put up on charges in the military?  Hello?  Hello? [PAUSE] Hello? [NOISE]
