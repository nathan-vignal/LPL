R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Mary Joe.
L:  Hi, Mary Joe.  This is Carol.  How are you?
R:  Hi.  Fine.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing pretty good.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Uh, am I calling to someone in the south?
R:  No.  I'm -- I'm from Ohio.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you've got such a southern ...
R:  What's that?
L:  You're got such a southern sound to your voice.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, Kentucky's right across the river.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm from Cincinnati.
L:  And -- and we're just north of Pittsburgh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Nice to meet ya, Carol.
L:  Nice talking to you.
R:  Okay.  Well, I get most of my current news from the Internet I think more than any place 'cause I work the second shift.  So, I don't really watch too much television.  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and I guess I get most of mine from my husband.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, I have two daughters are home and we home school them.  So, I don't watch much T.V. and he usually keeps me up on anything that he feels is important.
R:  Really?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- yeah, I might watch the news at noon every now and then, but usually I see like the M.S.N., uh, Internet headlines.  I might click on them and read those every now and then, but I don't really watch a whole lot of T.V.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't either --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unless he calls and says, you know, something major has happened --
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, switch on to, uh, Fox News then ...
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Yeah.  And I read some of the discussion boards too.  I get online and it seems like I get more current events looking at some of those discussion boards on the computer I get on to, get 'em faster that way than anything I think.  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and do you feel it's more trustworthy your discussion boards?
R:  Um, yeah.  Well, 'cause one of 'em I'm on a lot like and I feel like -- and I've met some of the people actually.  It's like a Disney World, uh, forum and I've met a lotta people down in Disney World that I talk to.  So, yeah.  I mean, that particular one, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's pretty current.  I'll find out fast -- stuff quicker from that board than [LAUGH] anything else it seems like.
L:  I -- I know with, um [LIPSMACK], our local news it's -- it's so -- ah, I don't wanna say -- you have to just be careful of the slant that it's on --
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  I guess that's more like news from around the country, you know, like people from Chicago might post something about -- like that balcony -- that collapsing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- up in Chicago, you know?  I saw that posted by someone from Chicago on the Internet board, you know, before I heard it on the news, you know, about that happening and I guess they had heard it in Chicago, but it hadn't came our way quite yet.   So, it seems like I get it quicker -- at least news from other parts of the country that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.  [LAUGH]  More from the computer than anything I think.
L:  I think the computer's amazing though.  I wonder how -- when our kids get older --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, what are they gonna have?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like everybody's got a computer now just about.  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and it's so easy to get access to anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything that you need.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  It is.  Yeah.
L:  Well, you rely on it for -- for the -- the news.  Um, we rely on it more for education purposes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with our girls still in school --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and it just amazes us that, you know, when they -- they get older what are they gonna have?  What --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what's technology going to do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for them?
R:  Yeah.  More -- it's like -- it's like it's required now, you know, to know computer basics.  Like, you need to know it to do anything just about now [LAUGH] and it involves the computer.
L:  Yeah.  Our public schools have them and even in the kindergarten classrooms.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I think they're even putting them on tests now a lotta them on the -- what is it? -- like the college entrance tests, questions and stuff.
L:  I hadn't heard that.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  I heard that.
L:  Well, I know my husband's taken, uh, college courses for a master's --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and his class does a lot online --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with -- with the college.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some of the high schools you have to have a laptop I think, some of the -- I guess the private schools --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the more expensive ones they require you to have a laptop.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah.  And here the Catholics -- there are some Catholic private schools that require the kids to have a laptop.  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess if they figure you can afford to send your kids to private --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- school ...
R:  Yeah.  Some of those high schools I think cost more than college around here.  [LAUGH]
L:  I opted out of that and went home schooling.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.
L:  Uh, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then -- then I can pick and choose what the girls are learning and, you know, even with the computer that we use it, um -- to -- to monitor that more with what they're doing.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yep.  Are they young, two young girls?
L:  Ten and twelve.
R:  Ten and twelve?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, is it hot up where you are too, as hot as it is down here?
L:  It's -- it's warm down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we're, um, I think probably in the eighties.
R:  In the -- yeah.
L:  Beautiful blue sky.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's hot ...
L:  After all that rain though we were ready for the break.
R:  Yeah.  Really?  We had a lotta rain too, flooding around here.  So, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  We just came back from Georgia and I used the Internet to keep track of the weather down there [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do too.  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause -- 'cause we were in the middle of that rain nonstop and you would get one day that you'd have to go outside and get everything done --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and when we were planning our trip I kept checking the weather --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and their weather was almost identical to ours except warmer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I thought oh, man, if we've got that drive down there in all this rain --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and it cleared up nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was so glad.
R:  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get on that, um, weather channel too and check out the weather all the time if I'm going somewhere, like Orlando.  We go there a lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  We -- we have the weather as our home page.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  We have it at work too.  We can click right on there and see what the weather is.  Yeah.  So, yep.
L:  You -- you said you work third shift?
R:  Uh, second shift.
L:  Where at?
R:  At -- at, uh, an insurance company in downtown Cincinnati.
L:  Which insurance company?
R:  Um, it's Western Southern Life.
L:  Okay.  My hus- -- the only reason I -- I ask 'cause my husband worked with seniors with long term care --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- for about fourteen or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fifteen years.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Uh, but -- but that wasn't the name of the company.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a financial company too.  They're -- they do a lot of stuff besides that.  I'm not actually -- I don't know -- really know that much about the insurance 'cause I'm not in that part of it.  I'm in the I.T. part.  So, I don't really know [LAUGH] much about that the -- I'm in the computer center.  So, I don't deal with that part of it.
L:  And -- and how long have you been working?
R:  There or working in general?
L:  Working in general.
R:  Oh, gosh, jeeze, since about junior high school I was delivering papers.  So [LAUGH], since about junior high school I guess.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah.  Putting those little a- -- I don't know -- those little ads you used to get on your front doorstep from all the stores I used to do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess I was about -- I don't know -- sixth or seventh grade.  I can't remember.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know I worked right after I got outta high school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I was one of the fortunate ones that my parents did not make me have a job during school, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and worked for ten years before I quit and had kids then --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I have not gone back into the workforce.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's good that, you know, you can stay home with your kids.  That's really nice.
L:  [MN] You make sacrifices --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I think it's worth it.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'd say it's definitely worth it, yeah, to do that.
L:  Do -- do you have kids?
R:  No.  I don't have kids.  No.  I'm married, but I don't have kids.
L:  They're -- they're a challenge.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I have a lotta nieces and nephews.  I have like nine, ten, eleven, twelve -- I have thirteen nieces and nephews.  So, I know.  Yeah.
L:  It's a challenge but, yeah, every day brings something new --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and exciting and ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I -- I know when my one daughter was in the public school and she'd come home and -- and we had a discussion at the supper table and -- and we were not coming up with the same answers what she was taught.  So, my husband turned around at the dinner table and jumped online and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and it was all over butterflies --
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- where we called it a cocoon, it's now a +chrysalis --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and he said, "Oh, my goodness, honey, she's right" [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and I thought wow, you know, that Internet, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you get answers so quickly --
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.
L:  -- and -- and it was just amazing.
R:  Yep.
L:  But my husband I were taught the same thing and we thought no, surely she misunderstood something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that was said.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's -- it's exciting and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- challenging, but educational and something new every day.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Everything you need.  I know.  When I used to go to school I'd have to, you know -- a book re-
