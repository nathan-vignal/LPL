R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Lisa.
L:  I'm Cindy.
R:  Hi, Cindy.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in, um, California.  Where do you live?
R:  In California.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  I'm Bakersfield.
R:  Oh, I'm in, uh, San Roselle, which is just over the Golden Gate Bridge.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how did you hear about this?
R:  Um, through a -- a user net group that I was on for, uh, parenting and ...
L:  For what?
R:  For parenting.
L:  Oh, for parenting.
R:  But everybody was talking about how they did this.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's how I heard about it too, not through, um, parenting, but through mystery shopping.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do that too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, do you use computer games?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I think I do that to relieve the stress because, um, I'm on the computer so much, you know, with what I do and sometimes it's nice to just, um, blank out for a while.  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, no, I don't.  I -- I -- I think I actually avoid them because I think if I did them I know I would like 'em and I would get addicted --
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  -- and I feel like my -- my time is -- is so tight right now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I can't afford to do anything like that.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  It's kinda hard 'cause I -- I would like to do it, but it is -- you're right, it helps you relax when you're -- you've worked really hard.  But I've got a huge project going on right now.  So, I -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I try to avoid it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, what kinda games would you play if you were on the computer?  What -- what kinda games do you like?
R:  Um ...
L:  Like word games or number games or ...?
R:  You know, the -- the -- the game that I've played in the last few months was, uh, actually Solitaire on the computer, which I -- I originally found for my six year old daughter.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was really fun.  [LAUGH]  It was a site that had like three hundred different Solitaire games --
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  -- and it -- and it -- you know, there's no shuffling of cards, which is [LAUGH] --
L:  That's fun.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it does it automatically.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I don't know what I would play.  I -- I -- when I was a kid I used to play that -- those games where you go into room after room trying to find mystery items.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Those were really fun.
L:  Well, the way I -- I started playing games on the computer was, um, at this site called Zone, uh -- Game Zone dot com or Zone dot com.  Anyway, it's got tons and tons of different kinds of games on there and you can even play with other people, you know, and communicate.  Like, I like to play Backgammon --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and so I go into, you know -- they -- they have these different rooms where you can go in and you can just play Backgammon with somebody and -- and I've met people from all over the world.  It's ...
R:  You're kidding me?
L:  No.  It has been just really amazing.  [COUGH]  Um ...
R:  That is so cool.
L:  It is.  You know, from, um -- the most interesting, uh, person I think I met was, um, uh, this lady who was in Lebanon and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- while we were playing Backgammon she was actually sneaking on the computer because, you know, she could be severely punished for using the Internet and we were talking about how it's so much different here for women than it is for there and, I mean, it was just really interesting.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  They're not allowed to use the Internet, or just women?
L:  Well, her boss -- yeah, well, she worked for a company.  She was allowed to work because she coached the women's basketball team.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, athletes over there are like the elite --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  So, she was ...
R:  [NOISE] What's that?
L:  I don't know.  That's weird.
R:  [NOISE] It is weird.  It's stopped.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  But anyway, it's -- it's interesting to talk to people.  I mean, I've talked to people in Africa and, you know, Australia, Greece, you know, all over the world and you're just sitting there playing a Backgammon game and having like a little conversation.
R:  Oh, you shouldn't have told me that 'cause now I'm gonna [LAUGH] go check it out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I knew this conversation was gonna be dangerous.
L:  Yeah.  You could do the same thing with Checkers.
R:  Wow.
L:  They have ...
R:  That is so cool.
L:  Yeah.  They have Internet international Checkers.  I mean, you can go online at any time because of the -- of the time zone differences people are online all the time.
R:  Well, that's a good thing to do when you have insomnia.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  I could use it for that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, you know, the nights I spend up all night after my family goes to bed and I'm putting in applications all over the place, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's like two o'clock in the morning and I think you know what?  I just wanna talk to somebody, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's -- that's -- that's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I do download a lotta video games for my daughter but, um, I didn't know that there was this whole network for adults.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  My, um, husband likes to play a game called Euchre.  He's from back east and -- and so I don't think most people on the west coast are real familiar with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But back east it's really big.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, he gets -- he gets on there and plays Euchre with people from all over the world.  So, it's ...
R:  How do you play it?
L:  It's a -- like a card game.  It's almost like, um, uh -- have you ever played like Pea Knuckle?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's like that where you have -- you have a meld and, you know -- and there's four people usually sitting at a table.  So, you're playing with three other people --
R:  Oh, how neat.
L:  -- and they're from all over.  Yeah.  It's really interesting.
R:  [LAUGH] That is so cool.  You know so much about this.
L:  Oh, well [LAUGH], I just -- you know, actually I just got a computer in, uh -- last October, my first computer.
R:  You are kidding me?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, my!
L:  Well, I'm from -- no, I'm from a different era, you know?  I mean. I'm fifty --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I -- I didn't grow up ...
R:  That's not old.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I didn't grow up with computers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They didn't have computers in the schools.  They didn't have -- I had no, um, contact with them at all un- until, you know, I started hearing about 'em later in life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it was -- you know how you think -- you know, it's like cell phones.  Well, I've done without 'em my whole life what do I need one for, you know?  [LAUGH]  But ...
R:  And then once you get one you can't let go of it.
L:  Exactly.  So, I just thought, you know, this is really the -- the way and if I don't get a computer I'm gonna be totally [LAUGH], you know, in the dark and left out and I'm raising one of my grandchildren.  So, I thought, you know, I need to get one.
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  So, I got one in October and so, you know, you -- you start to familiarize yourself with it and play around with it and I just started finding these things, you know?  [LAUGH]  But it ...
R:  Sounds like you've come a long way since October.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I have because I've -- I've developed a whole business, you know, and I'm just -- I just decided if I'm gonna invest in a computer and a printer and all the other stuff, you know, that you -- and the Internet service and all that stuff that you have to invest in I'm gonna make it pay for itself.  [NOISE]  So, I -- I'm where -- I'm earning my living from my computer.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Am I allowed to ask what you do or is that not related to video games?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  Well, I'm -- no, I've -- I have been doing mystery shopping totally fulltime.
R:  Oh, totally from the computer?
L:  Totally from the computer, mystery shopping and merchandising.
R:  Oh, Bak- Bakersfield must be a big area for that then?
L:  Um, it isn't.  It really isn't.  But, um --
R:  How do you do it fulltime?
L:  -- I just -- I have put in too many hours on the computer believe me.  I work for about forty seven companies now.
R:  Wow!  God!
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I mean, it's -- I -- I -- I belong to all the groups and all the forums and all the -- everything and I know most people just do it part time because you have families and they have kids and, you know, you can't really do this fulltime.  It doesn't really pay to do it fulltime unless you can get on big projects or do merchandising --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or things like that.  So, that's what I'm doing.
R:  Oh, good for you though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's neat.
L:  Yeah.  So, you know, my granddaughter's at the age now where she really needs me to be at home.  Things are happening, you know?  She's -- she'll be twelve in August --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, I've always been a rest- -- in the restaurant business.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  In fact my husband's a chef.  So, I was always gone at night and stuff and she's just at that age where she's just starting to get into trouble and, you know ...?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it was time for me to stay home and try to get that situation under control.  So, I figured, you know, if I have to be home you can only stay on unemployment for so long, you know?  [LAUGH]  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I invested in the computer and, you know, I'm trying to earn a living off of that.  [NOISE]
R:  And you have a cat.  [LAUGH]
L:  And I have a cat whose standing here [LAUGH] meow- -- I'm a cat -- I'm a cat person.  I just ...
R:  Oh, well, would you like to hear my cat?  My cat's on my lap.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  They have a way of coming up when you're on the phone.
L:  Oh, I know and he's such a baby, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's just gotta be everywhere I am.  So ...
R:  Oh, have you done these calls before?
L:  Yeah.  This is my third one.
R:  Oh, okay.  This is the last one you can do.
L:  This -- well, I guess, but from some of the forms that I'm reading they are -- some people are doing more and they're begging for males, for men.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I heard that.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I -- I'm thinking maybe of signing my husband up and [LAUGH] -- you know, and he can take a few calls.
R:  Yeah.  He could've done this one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  He could of.  In fact he's on the computer right now [LAUGH] as I'm talking to you.
R:  Doing a video game?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  If he's -- he's not doing Playstation, you know, he's doing the computer.  So ...
R:  The problem with video games is they -- they -- to me they take up -- they're time snappers, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You can -- you can just keep on playing them and playing them and suddenly all this time has gone by.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That could easily happen, you know?  You have to kinda limit yourself or -- or say, you know, I just feel like a quick game of this or a quick game of that, but I have to do this, you know, I've gotta get this done.  You know what I mean?  It's just a break.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's kinda like when you're working and you take a fifteen minute break.
R:  I bet there are a lotta people that are addicted, aren't there?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  There's -- there's some sites I go on they're just -- I see the same people all the time.  I'm thinking what do you people do, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It -- how sad, you know?
R:  I know.  That is.  But you know what?  Then they --
