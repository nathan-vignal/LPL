R:  Hi.  I'm Jen.
L:  Hi.  I'm Michelle.
R:  Hi Michelle.  I didn't really catch the n- -- the, ah -- the topic.  Did you catch it?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Did you catch the topic?
L:  I -- I picked the topic?
R:  No, did you -- did you -- did you hear what the topic was?
L:  Um, yes, I did about how do you stay with current events?  How do you stay up on current events?
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I think --
L:  Like, TV, radio, newspaper, friends ...
R:  Right.  Well, I usually do it over the internet.  Um, I'm using a lot of the internet to get my information.  I don't usually watch TV, um, but I go online every day and just, ah, get information off, ah, the, ah [LIPSMACK] -- the, ah, news, ah, website.  Um --
L:  That's -- that's basically what I do too.  I use the internet and then, um, my husband tells me a lot and then -- because I don't really like to watch the news -- I have young children.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- but once in a while -- once a week, I'll try to watch the news to get caught up, ah, like, CNN.  I don't really like to watch the -- the local news but ...  So, that's -- basically, I'm the same as you -- I -- I'm on the internet a lot.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I do the same thing.  I -- I usually -- the first -- the first site that I go to is CNN and then I go to, ah, Fox News sometimes and -- and just, kinda, browse around and w- whatever picks my attention, that's where I go in and verify.  Sometimes I listen to, um, talk radio when I'm driving around --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, ah, other than that I -- I don't -- I don't really go to the newspapers or anything like that.  Um, I -- sometimes I do talk to my co workers a- about what's going a- as far as the news on, you know, the local events, you know, and -- but, um, that's pretty ...  Um, I'm a single person so I don't have a lot of interaction with family members. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, I'm --
R:  So --
L:  -- I'm the same.  I just, ah -- I usually -- someone will say, "Did you hear about --" if it's local and I'll be, like, "No" [LAUGH] you know?  Because I don't really w- -- I don't -- the local news seems to be so bad on TV so really, I'm like you, I just -- I don't really read the newspaper.  Sometimes we'll get it on Sundays but mainly, [COUGH] if it's local, I'll hear it from, you know, people at my kids' school or church or ...  But mainly, um, I like to surf the internet a lot myself and I -- I -- I go to CNN -- CNN and I like to watch that on cable and that's really the only place I get my news unless I hear about a story from someone, then I might research it, you know, if it's interesting to me.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think I do the same thing.  What I like about the internet though is that, ah, you just, kinda, see the f- -- the headline and then if you're interested you can go in.  You don't have to look as opposed in -- like, TV that you have to l- -- go through the whole thing if you wanna get to your -- the -- the news that you -- or, [NOISE] y- you know, the -- the -- the topic that you were waiting for.
L:  Exactly.  You have to watch everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- instead of just --
R:  You know --
L:  -- a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and -- and that's -- that's the one thing that I do like about the internet that you can just click and just get the whole story and then you have related topics that you can go to another site and just -- you get more information about that if you choose ta- -- choose to and, um ...  And so, that's, ah -- that's, pretty much, the -- the reason I do the internet rather than any other thing.  Ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, as far as the weather, it's also, you know, the best -- the best way to go [LAUGH] 'cause you get all the pictures and stuff.
L:  It is 'cause it's updated so much.  I like to check the weather on the -- the news -- on the internet too.  Movies, everything -- it's just so easily accessible.  So much, um --
R:  And it's --
L:  Even faster than using the telephone.
R:  Yeah.  And y- you -- and you don't need to pay all that much mon- -- m- money every -- you know, every month or every y- -- um, every day to, ah, like, m- -- you would do with your newspaper.  You know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, you know, they d- --
L:  Well, I think -- can't you even, like, watch movies and TV on the internet now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  On your --
R:  I -- I've -- I've heard -- I've heard of people that do that.  I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they even listen to the radio I think.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I have a brother --
L:  We have a radio station here locally that a lotta people listen to I think and d- -- have other states and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's always interesting.  But I -- I don't, um -- I don't enjoy hearing about a lotta bad stuff, you know?  So, I don't really -- the news isn't my -- my main thing so I'm like you, I like to pick what I wanna read about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um -- and leave the rest for everybody else. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] I know.  I think -- I think the same way too.  Sometimes I'm just not interested in, um, listening about all these people that are dying here and there, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  W- -- ah, although, I have to admit that during the war I was really hooked and I would just come home and just turn on the TV and just, kinda, follow along and --
L:  Mhm.  I think I -- I watch TV more when things like that happen.  Like, nine eleven or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, you know, the war and waiting to see what's happening.  Then I'll -- and then I'll watch the TV for that.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  But, um --
R:  But only then.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think I'm in the same, um, page with you there.  Um, there will be the, ah -- the only times that I will watch really[?] see it on the TV and watch it for more than ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Well, they've got so many different, kind of, ah, news channels now on the TV.  I think they've got, like, one for the weather and then one is CNN, which I like to watch because they also do the -- the things at the bottom of the TV, the scroll where you can, you know, read but, um -- and then you can just turn it a- -- they do it, like, I think, over -- a repeat over and over so you don't really have to watch it.  But I -- but a- -- first thing in the morning, I get on the internet and I -- I -- some days, I'm on it -- I'm on the internet all day long.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Until my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everything's finished and it's easy to get caught up in reading stuff and before you know it, you've been on the computer, like, three or four hours.
R:  Yeah.  I -- it's -- yeah, it's -- it's so -- it's so easy to -- to get so mu- much more information out of the internet than anything else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A -- a friend of mine had a subscription to the newspaper and she had a [inaudible] by the front[?] and then she's, like, "Oh, you know, it's just --"  I'm getting cluttered with all this paper and I said, "Is it okay if I just bring in the dumpster?"  So, I just -- you know, I just [SIGH] keep it here and then it takes me a while to take it to the recycling.  So, that's also another hassle.  You know, you -- you get all clutter with all these papers from the newspaper.  And then when you watch TV you get all these commercials and things that are not really important.  So, yeah, I -- I -- I have to say that if -- if I didn't have TV or -- or radio or -- or, ah, um, newspapers but I have the internet, that's all I would -- you know, [LAUGH] I -- that's all I needed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just [inaudible] anything else.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE]
R:  Oh ... [SIGH]
L:  Well, um, the only thing that, um, I don't like about the internet these days is all the pop up --
R:  Oh, y- --
L:  -- things.  Like, if you go to some websites, sometimes they just -- they -- everything will just keep popping up, you know?  Different pictures and -- and if you close that one, another one pops up.  Do you have that on yours a lot?
R:  Yeah.  I get that once in a while.  Um, but that's -- that's, um, just on my computer at home.  I think --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that my computer at work has a good -- good firewall for that and -- and they don't --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- sort of, pop up.  So, that's great.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause --
R:  My computer at home, I'm -- I'm -- I'll be doing something and all of a sudden I have one, two, three, four, five pop ups and they're just annoying but, um --
L:  I know.  It's almost like a commercial or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess you get -- you have to take, um -- take the good with the bad.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  But, um -- but I -- I think that there's ways around it, you know, where you can, ah, have your undivided attention to whatever news you're -- you're -- you're looking at.
L:  Sure.
R:  Um, just haven't -- for the pop ups, I just -- I just haven't researched it enough.  Um, I think there's -- there's ways that you can, um -- you can get rid of 'em or you -- you ca- -- you can put, like, a firewall or --
L:  Yeah.  I need to look into that.  Although, they're not as bad as they used to be and it's usually just when you, you know, go to places you're not used to going.
R:  Right.
L:  Then they'll --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pop up.  But, um, sometimes it's just aggravating when you're really serious about something and that just keeps happening.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, sometimes I also -- you know, like, the local stations here are -- well, I guess they're really called the same thing everywhere else, like, ABC and CBS and they have websites as well so I'll check them out and not only CNN, you know, to see what -- to, kinda, go to the different, um -- the different ones and see what they're reporting on 'cause sometimes they might have exclusives.  I -- I really like shows, like, um, you know, twenty eight, ah -- Forty Eight Hours and stuff that are about a certain topic.  So, sometimes I enjoy reading those on those, kinda, websites.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's true.  And, um, you know, it -- the -- one other thing good about the internet is that you can just punch in a specific topic or, you know -- and -- and you get all kinds of information whereas you have to -- the newspaper and watching TV, ah, you're only limited to -- to the one thing that's printed or the one -- the one, um, story that they're giving about that where e- --
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, if you --
L:  That is a good point.  You can, like, just do a s- -- put in one word and you'll get hundreds of things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that way you can go right to what you need instead of having to watch all the garbage.  And also, the newspaper, I don't even know whether to believe the newspaper anymore 'cause they just write, you know, so much stuff that's supposedly not true.
R:  Yeah.  Like that one guy in New York that he was -- he was, um, just writing stories of -- of somebody else's stories.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know if you've heard about that guy but he was a n- -- a newsman --
