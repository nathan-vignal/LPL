L:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
R:  Hi. I'm Cara.  Hello.
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Have you done this before?
L:  No.
R:  It's so weird.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- [LAUGH] I don't know, um, I haven't played any computer games.  I know my girlfriend loves to play Euchre and she keeps telling me I should get on there and try.
R:  Oh, on Yahoo?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I like playing Spades on Yahoo, it's a lot of fun.
L:  Oh, I'll have to, ah -- I don't know -- I don't even know where I go to to, ah, find it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, you just go to, the URL is games dot --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yahoo dot com --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and then you just sign up and then they have literally like dozens of games that you can play.  They have like a Scrabble kind of game, they've got, you know, all the card games, Pinochle, Spades, Hearts, Bridge, everything.
L:  Oh, I'm too dumb for Pinochle, too many [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I never understood, ah, you know, marriages and, ah, [SIGH] your -- I forget what my husband calls all that, melds and all that other that they --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- do, yeah.  No, I wasn't -- I mean, I know that my girlfriend played, ah, [MN] ... Euchre, but I didn't know that the other ones were available.
R:  Oh, they have everything, all kinds of stuff, not just card games either, um, you know, other games that you can play like, you know, buyer sells and stuff.  [SIGH] Um, and it's just, I mean, usually there are thousands of people who are online so you can always find someone to play with so [LAUGH] it's fun, a little addictive though.
L:  Oh, I would say.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How long have you been doing it?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I don't know, a few years now, I guess, ever since they really came out with them.  Um, you know, just for fun every once in a while, not too, too often.
L:  They -- there was a site that I went to, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, it was a couple of years ago -- um, I don't know, it was [LIPSMACK] -- I don't even know the -- remember the name of it, but it -- you know, it was like, ah, playing the slot machines --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you won so many, you know, points or whatever, but as usual I lost [LAUGH] them all so I never got anything from it, but that was really the only one that, ah, I had ever done anything with.  But I'll have to check the other ones out 'cause I do, you know, like to play Spades and, ah --
R:  Definitely, it's a lot of fun.  Um, do you have, like, high speed internet?
L:  No.  Unfortunately, um, we just moved and we're out her with the cows and the [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, where do you live?
L:  -- we [LAUGH] -- um, in Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, outside of Hartville, I don't know if you've ever heard of --
R:  No, I'm not familiar with that.
L:  Well, it's an Amish -- Amish area.  But, I mean, it's really built up, but anyway, we're, like, um, [LIPSMACK] seven houses away from, ah, the -- like the dividing line so they're saying in a couple months we'll have it.  So, right now I, you know, have, ah, it's like a turtle but it's all I can get [LAUGH] so.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I just --
R:  See that's the only thing, is like when you're playing online games, um, it can be really frustrating if you don't have a good connection, so if you still have dial up, [LIPSMACK] you know, that can be really frustrating.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I'll just, ah --
R:  But as soon as you get high speed internet you'll be ready to go.
L:  I'll be ready to go.  Oh, okay --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that sounds good.  Though this is the first one of these I've done.  I thought, "Well, they haven't called me, maybe they're not gonna call me", and I had no idea w- -- how it was going to be.
R:  How did you hear about it?
L:  Um, on the internet.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's sort of interesting.  At first I was like, "Is this really legitimate?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, you wonder because you think are they going to do this and then, ah, there's nothing to it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, also because they ask for your social security number and I really don't like giving my social security number out [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and so I was reading all about it and trying to go to the U. Penn web page to check it out and [LAUGH] just to make sure.
L:  What state are you in?
R:  I live right outside of Boston.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so [LIPSMACK] --
L:  How is it up there?
R:  It's -- it's nice.  It's been bad weather though, um, you know.  I think they said for the last twenty five weekends there were only two weekends where we didn't have rain or snow.
L:  Sounds like, ah, in Ohio.  Yeah, they either freeze you, you drowned or you cook, there's no happy medium to it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, exactly.  So, finally this weekend we had nice weather and it was just -- it was so nice to have the sun out for the whole weekend.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you say the best thing for the games is I'll just have to, ah, wait until I get high speed service.
R:  Well, you could try it and see, but I find that, um -- well, everything is better with, you know, cable modem or --
L:  Oh, sure, sure.
R:  -- um, but, just like for the games, particularly since you're playing with three other people and they have to wait for you to play, um, [LIPSMACK] and so if you have a bad connection, you know, people get frustrated and that's not good.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know my girlfriend said some of them sometimes they aren't too nice either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they can be, you know, but what do you expect, it's like, you know, total strangers and --
L:  Right, right, 'cause she said playing Euchre, the -- that, ah, one guy says, "Why, why did you make such a stupid move?" or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] something.  So -- 'cause we always, when we play cards we play partners so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but, ah, I know she -- she really enjoys it.  So I really will have to, ah, give it a try.  I'll try it the slow way and see what happens so then --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if it's too bad then I'll just have to wait.  Hopefully by the end of July they'll have the, ah, service out here, 'cause we have no cable either, so [LIPSMACK] nothing.
R:  So, are you from Ohio originally?
L:  Well, I was born in Kentucky but --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I've lived in Ohio since I was ten months old, so I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- guess I should say, "Yes".  But every year for eighteen years, you know, we went back to Kentucky, like three times a year so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, it was like I still knew what my roots were so --
R:  Well, and Ohio is right next door.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH] So it's not exactly, like, that far away.
L:  Ah, it's about, ah -- I think it's six hundred miles to where, um, I was born.  So, I haven't been for a few years.  My parents go a couple of times a year, but I haven't been for a few years so [LIPSMACK] I need to go but, you know -- 'cause the family's dwindling down --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, ah, [LIPSMACK] but, ah -- no, they go a couple of times a year so -- 'cause they're up in years and, ah, they get, ah, closer and closer, you know, 'cause there's just, you know, ah, my mom has no brothers or sisters left, they're all gone, but my dad has, ah, two sisters and a brother so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so he's, you know, fortunate.  But there's cousins because my mom came from a very large family, so her mother and her father both had like ten brothers and sisters, so [LIPSMACK] anyway -- but, ah, now when this --
R:  Big families.
L:  Yep.  Um --
R:  Holidays must have been crazy.
L:  Oh, yeah.  My mom used to say how they used to go to her grandmas and they, um, would line up tables.  Well, they did every Sunday, but Christmas was great, that they would line up tables through the whole middle of her house and they didn't have enough tables so it'd be, you know, pieces of wood and saw horses and -- to, you know, set the table and all the kids were always in the hallways to eat, and I forget, you know, there was a ton of kids but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the -- so now, when this was over then they ask you questions or you --
R:  I guess, I don't know.
L:  Oh, is this your first time too?
R:  Yeah, it's my first time.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I have no idea.  [LAUGH]
L:  I, ah, [MN] --
R:  I don't even know what they're looking for exactly.
L:  No, I don't -- I don't either.  When they said computer games, it's like, "Okay".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I wonder what other kinds of things they ask about?
L:  Well, I -- [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I mean I've -- I played when my son had a, you know --
