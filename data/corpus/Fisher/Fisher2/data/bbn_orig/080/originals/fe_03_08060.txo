R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  My name is Candy.
R:  Hi.  I'm Paula.
L:  Paula, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you calling from?
L:  Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Really?  I'm in Sherman Oaks.
R:  Oh, cool.  I used to live in, um, Studio City.
L:  Oh, funny.  Small world.
R:  I know.  So far I've gotten, um, two people from Wisconsin.
L:  Me too, I got someone from Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, how funny.  I wonder if they plan it that way.
L:  Yeah.  That's weird.  I'm actually from Minnesota.  So, right next door.
R:  Oh.  No.  Actually, no, I got one from Wisconsin and one from Minnesota and now that I think about it you're [LAUGH] -- that's pretty funny.
L:  It's weird.
R:  I'm actually a native Angelino.  So ...  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, there you go.  Um, so computer games.
R:  Yeah.  You know, I don't -- I'm not really into -- that -- that much into them.  I used to be when I used to -- you know, when I was at work and I got bored I used to just play sometimes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, I mean, I don't have time.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Not anymore.  But, um, I used to play Tetras whenever I had time.  That's the only game that I really like.
R:  Oh, that's a good game.
L:  But I never paid for it.  Mm?
R:  It's a big thing Tetras.
L:  Yeah.  It's horrible.  I could spend like four hours a day doing it.  I was working for P.B.S. at the time of September eleven --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- and production basically went down, but we still had to come into the office every day.  So, it was like non profit, work here and not doing anything.  I'll play Tetras just 'cause I didn't wanna read the [inaudible] or anything.  It's bad.
R:  Yeah.  It was a pretty depressing time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, wow --
L:  So ...
R:  -- that's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I guess I -- I don't have much to say about this subject just 'cause like I don't play games anymore, but Tetras was one I used to play too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's a few others.  I just can't remember the names of the games I used to play.
L:  Back in the day I had Nintendo and Nintendo had like Paper Boy and Super Mario Brothers and I'd do that after school every day.
R:  Oh, yeah, video games.
L:  So ...
R:  Uh, are those considered computer games?
L:  I guess not.  They're the ones ...
R:  I guess they could be.
L:  Yeah.  Computer games not at all.  Just Tetras.
R:  Like ...
L:  It's weird because you -- you can gamble online and everything too.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  I guess those could be considered computer games.
R:  Did you use -- ever use to gamble for real money or just for fun?
L:  Never on the computer, no, I go to Vegas for that 'cause we're close enough.
R:  What's that?
L:  I go to Vegas for that 'cause we're close enough and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Totally.
L:  -- and I wouldn't [LAUGH] -- I wouldn't gamble on the computer.  It could be bad.
R:  Yeah.  It seems like kind of a sad thing to be doing by yourself, just sitting there losing money, you know?  It's like I'd rather go to Vegas, get my free drinks and maybe meet people and ...
L:  Totally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, how many of these phone calls have you done?
L:  This is only my second.  The first time I have to tell you how weird it was 'cause I didn't know what was going on and the other girl's name -- my name is Candy and it's a very odd name --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and her name was Candy --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I was so confused.  I was like what is going on?  And we -- we were talking about the government and Iraq and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- basically they never found any nuclear warheads or anything to disarm.  So, I was like this is kinda dated.  But it was interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I don't remember the first time what I was talking about, but it was interesting.  I was like --
L:  How did you ...?
R:  -- a little drunk.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's awesome.  Yeah.  All the -- all the calls have come to me late at night.  So, you never know what you'll get.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's always around the nine o'clock hour for me so far.
L:  Yep.
R:  It's -- this is my third call and it's been around the same time.
L:  [COUGH] Are you done after three?
R:  What's that?
L:  Are you done after three calls, is that it?
R:  Um, some people get five calls.  Others get three.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I guess -- I don't know -- they decide when you're done maybe.
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  I belong to a website called Refunding Makes Cents.  It's like a ...
L:  Refunding?
R:  Yeah.  Refunding.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's like a coupon website where people just --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- talk about like all the good deals that are going on.
L:  Oh, great.  Yeah.
R:  And somebody like wrote in about oh, you should check this out and so I did.
L:  Very good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was amazing how fast ...
L:  A friend ...
R:  Oh, go ahead.
L:  A friend of mine emailed me.  She's like sign up for this.  You'll get paid for talking.  I'm like okay.
R:  I know.  At first I didn't believe it.  It was like what's the catch, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like you just talk --
L:  We'll see.
R:  -- to someone.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I know.  It's like you haven't been paid yet though.  There is still -- who knows?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I'm not worried.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not either.  It's like -- it's not like you've -- you've invested anything, just ten minutes of your time, you know, talking to someone.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Are you into reality T.V. at all?
R:  Yeah.  I watch -- you know what I've been watching is like that model show on Tuesday nights.
L:  I did watch that last week.  It's funny.
R:  It's -- it's hilarious.  I'm -- I'm not -- I'm not really into any of the Survivor stuff anymore.  I'm over it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the model one is just -- it's cracking me up.  Every time I watch it I just like -- I -- I can't stop laughing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Pretty much all of them -- all of them I -- I watch just because I wanna laugh about 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, like what are you doing people?  And it's just funny.  And Tara Banks is funny on that show.
R:  Yeah.  And the girls are so dumb.  It's like it makes me feel better.  It's like ...  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.  It's like such guilt, you know, T.V.
L:  Guilty pleasure.
R:  Guilty pleasure.  Yeah.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  For Love or Money is on right now and it's this horrible thing where the girls are trying to get this guy to pick them so they get money.  They get a thou- -- a million dollars.
R:  Wh- how does that work?
L:  Well, they're -- they're totally -- it's like The Bachelor, but the winner gets a million dollars and they ditch the guy.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow!
L:  So, they're all trying to get the guy to go after her -- or go after -- you know, go after each girl so -- 'cause they want the million dollars not because they really like him.
R:  Oh, God!  It just gets worse and worse, doesn't it?
L:  Bad news.  I know.  But I had a sad l- little addiction to it.  Oh, well.
R:  Well, I mean, it's -- you know, you work all day and then you come home and you watch that and it makes you feel better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just 'cause you see how like, uh, everyone else's life -- life is, uh, worse than yours I guess or ...  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  I don't know.  It's pretty funny.
L:  Everyone's got their problems.  Yeah.  So, what did you do out here when you were working?
R:  I was actually in radio marketing.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Um, I worked at, uh, you know, Clear Channel?
L:  No.
R:  Well, we own a bunch of like personal- radio personalities like [several inaudible words].
L:  Oh, sure.  Sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know them.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  It was fun.  It was like an interesting job, but I'm actually now going back to grad school.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, at U.C.L.A.  So, I'm done with that kind of -- the corporate working environment.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  U.C.L.A.  Okay.
R:  What do you do?
L:  I do documentaries for television.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like for P.B.S.?
L:  Uh, I did work for P.B.S. for a while.  Right now I'm working on a discovery show.  So, I -- I do freelance.  I've done stuff for the learning channel and M.T.V. and right now it's the discovery channel and I was at P.B.S. for ...
R:  Wow, that must be really rewarding.
L:  Uh, more or less.  Right now I'm working on like murder type stuff and forensics and that sorta thing.  Those are really popular and I hate it.
R:  Really?
L:  But that's where the jobs are.
R:  Why do you hate it?
L:  No.  I don't hate it.  But I prefer to be working on like, um -- I was doing documentaries on World War Two and documentaries on like controversial subjects and photography and that sorta thing and now it's -- it's down to scene of the crime and the jury and that sorta thing that I'm working on, forensic files.
R:  Oh.  And that's just not your -- that's not your area of interest?
L:  No.  I mean, it's getting to be just 'cause I've -- I've got -- I've gained so much knowledge of it, but I'd rather be working on, you know, documentaries about people, on biography, or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  I'm actually really into the forensic stuff, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- actually I used to be more than I am now.  Like, shows like C.S.I.
L:  Yep.
R:  Did you ever watch that?
L:  Yeah.  We're actually dealing with some of the same people.  We're doing like a discoveries version of C.S.I. I guess.
R:  Oh, I've seen that show.
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  I've seen that show.  Yeah.
L:  -- it's cheesy.  It's a lot cheesier.  It's not as high quality.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But that's what I do.
R:  It's addicting T.V.  It's like -- it's the same thing as like the reality stuff.  It's like you're watching --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's about like some -- I don't know.  It's -- it's another guilty pleasure.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.  So ...
R:  So, how old are you?
L:  Twenty six.  I've just turned twenty six.
R:  Oh, cool.  I'm twenty seven.
L:  Twenty seven.  Cool.  And you're not in --
R:  Yeah.  I don't ...
L:  -- Studio City anymore?
R:  No.  I moved actually to West L.A. --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to be closer to U.C.L.A.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, good deal.
R:  Of course the Valley is so hot and I was just -- it was just getting to me the summers.  I lived --
L:  Yeah.  My boyfriend ...
R:  -- in the Valley for three ...
L:  For three years?
R:  Yeah.  Three years.  Yeah.  Go ahead.
L:  My -- my boyfriend lives in West L.A. and I can't ever get him to spend the night up here 'cause he's like it's too hot, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what?  It's so weird.  Once you move out of the Valley you never wanna go back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I used to have so many friends out in this area in Hollywood and they never ever would come to the Valley to go anywhere, even like a g- -- a good restaurant.  It's like forget it and --
L:  I'm ...
R:  -- now I -- I always vowed like oh, I'll never be like that, you know?  But I never go to the Valley and I have friends there and I just -- they always have to come out to me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm close to moving very soon.  I've been looking and ...
R:  And Sherman Oaks is actually a nice part of the Valley, you know?  That's where my office used to be.
L:  Yeah.  I like it.  It's just the summers are unbear- --
