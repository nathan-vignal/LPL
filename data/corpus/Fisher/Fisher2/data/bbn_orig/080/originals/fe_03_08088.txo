L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Penny.
R:  Hi, Penny, this is Todd.  How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  Good.  I understand we are to talk about how we, uh, how we get information for current events?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I, uh, uh, you can go ahead and start.
L:  Go ahead. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, I usually rely on television and internet and I don't particularly have a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- specific, uh, uh, news network that I do watch, but I do have a specific website I go to, and it's probably because I just have it saved in my -- in my favorite file.  It's, uh, CNN dot com website.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But as far as, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- news on the -- current events on the television, I really rely on [SIGH] on, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the world news as well as local news for my market area.
L:  Yeah, I, um, [NOISE] I don't subscribe to the newspaper anymore. [NOISE] It's been pretty refreshing. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] You know? [NOISE] Um, I -- for one, I'm not good about reading it every day, but I leave it sitting around and then it accumulates and it's too much stuff in my house. [LAUGH]
R:  That's the exact problem we, uh, we have, uh, probably three months' worth of newspapers in our garage that we read and then we -- we end up recycling but, I, uh, we like for the -- for the coupons. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we don't even get that anymore.  It's just, like, "No, that's out of here" you know? [LAUGH] And -- and our, um, local paper has a website that you can read about all the articles on it.
R:  Yeah, that as well, but on the weekends I -- maybe it's, uh, just a point of relaxation, but I like to -- I -- I do like to read the paper on the weekends.  It's just a -- sitting in a breakfast room with the sun coming in, it's something to do on a Saturday and Sunday morning.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Tennessee, in, uh, right outside of Nashville.
L:  Oh.
R:  And you?
L:  Um, Gainesville, Florida.
R:  Okay.  That's -- I'm at -- that's a --
L:  We're just --
R:  -- a -- a --
L:  -- watching, like, a old, uh, game on TV, the Gators in -- in, uh, Kentucky from [inaudible] day so it's on in sunshine. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I understand, I understand.
L:  Getting --
R:  Um, let's see, the -- the -- the recording also stated do you, [MN] by chance, get your current events from the radio?
L:  Uh, I like to listen to NPR.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, classic, uh, radio and, um, I know they do have some current events, um, local, but most of the time it's, you know, news programs out of, uh, Washington or New York or whatever and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yes, I like that a whole lot.
R:  Uh, we -- we also have NPR here in Nashville, but that's not something I -- I make an effort to listen to.  I -- I do listen to a -- to a talk radio station that has current events in it's, uh, current news events in its news updates.
L:  Like in, "Every hour --"
R:  E- exactly.
L:  "-- top of the hour", yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Every hour, [LAUGH] yeah, every half hour, a thing of that nature.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, I suppose, uh, I have -- I -- I've heard a lot of, uh, especially as of recent with all the controversy in what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- President, uh, Bush did in, uh, i- in the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- far East, with the -- a lot of the, uh, news networks only --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're -- they're being very one sided and I don't quite --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know an objective source to go to to really investigate those -- those accusations.
L:  [NOISE] I guess you could go to international, they have an international, uh, [NOISE] cable channel on our TV.
R:  I was not aware of that.
L:  Mhm, and it has, uh, different international -- but then also, I don't know, um, [LIPSMACK] on regular -- regular TV, the PBS --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, channel has, uh, the BBC news.
R:  I -- I have seen that, but I've never really paid that much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- attention to it.
L:  So, they would have, you know, their perspective on it [NOISE] too, which is, you know, a- again, but anything you see on TV is definitely, um, what they want you to see.
R:  Yeah, and I've -- I've slowly started to realize that, and it wasn't until it was just brought to my attention, um, I --
L:  No, it's exactly what you wanna see. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Or what they want you to see. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, exactly.  I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- understand.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, let's see --
L:  So, even if it came from a- n- nother country it would be their slant.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, I guess the truth lies somewhere, but I -- I -- I do have to say, I do the ABC and the, uh, Peter Jennings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is my [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] main source of world news tonight.
R:  [MN] We -- we -- my wife and I watch, uh, after, uh, well, when I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I usually leave about fifteen minutes into the show, but we really enjoy Good Morning America and I --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- know -- I -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  I watch that too.
R:  I -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I -- I really, really enjoy that show, and always have and, uh, I suppose it does have somewhat of a very narrow focus on just what's going on, I guess more popular culture kind of things --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I do enjoy th- their --
L:  I -- I do like the ABC program, although [NOISE] I'm really bad, I have that picture in the picture TV --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I'll have, like, channel ABC or CBS --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and NBC in the little picture window and if there is a commercial or something comes up better --
R:  And flip back and forth?
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  That's a -- I -- that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that would be very confusing for me.  My -- my mind's a little too [NOISE] one track.
L:  Well, it's great actually during the football season and stuff --
R:  Oh, I can imagine.
L:  -- when there's a game. [LAUGH]
R:  I'll bet that would be a lot of fun.
L:  Uh-huh.  I do like that.
R:  [SIGH] Let's see.  This is actually my first survey.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yes, so I've never --
L:  Oh, you're -- you're doing v- very good, especially about listening to the directions, because I was, like, "What?"
R:  Oh, well, and see, I -- and I -- I -- and mi- -- and my wife kind of turned me onto this thing, and I understand it's just -- it's studying -- is it linguistics?
L:  Um, I -- I don't know.  I'm not sure what the scope is.
R:  Well, that is my understanding and I -- I don't think it's that important that we stay on the topic.  I think it's just a topic to kind of start talking about and then all of a sudden, I'm sure w- -- people do what you and I are doing, it's just --
L:  I know, I think it's how people communicate, it isn't necessarily that they're talking about what is --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- prescribed.
R:  See, I --
L:  That was my take.  This is only --
R:  W- --
L:  -- my second one.
R:  Okay.
L:  I was signed up a long time ago, but I didn't know that you could call in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you call in or did they call you?
R:  They called me tonight.
L:  Yeah, me too, but I didn't know that you can call in and I had told my friend about it and she was, like, "Oh, you can do this now" and I really meant to get three of them in last month just because, okay, I could do that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I didn't --
R:  Can you -- can --
L:  -- and it's, like, "Oh, it's already July, darn".
R:  Can you do three a month?
L:  I think that's the thing.  Then they --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sent out a thing saying they really needed males.
R:  Oh.
L:  Male participants, 'cause I guess the women --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go, "Phone call?  I can do that" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, um, so I emailed a bunch of guys and I don't know if there has been any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- response or not.
R:  Well, I, uh, I was under the impression that it was just a -- a three time deal, then it's over forever.  But I g- --
L:  It's a month, is what I believe.
R:  That is awesome.
L:  So, you can, like, talk on the phone and, yeah, I think, you know, 'cause I have a -- and, like I said, this is only my second one, just because I didn't know, then I tried to call in and they didn't even have my number registered, even though I'd already gotten one call.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so then they go, "You're activated". [NOISE]
R:  Well, I tell you what --
L:  And then I forgot about it.
R:  -- one of the things that -- that -- that initially startled me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is the young lady I spoke with last night from the company --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, they -- did you give them your Social Security number?
L:  [NOISE] I probably did.
R:  That -- that -- I know that they need that for tax reporting purposes but, um, she said, "You can ahead and do your three, but you just won't get paid until you give them [MN] -- 'til you give us --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- your Social --" that was just -- that's just so leery.  I mean -- I mean, I'm just so leery about things like that.
L:  No, I think I told people -- well, I also had signed up to do these mystery shopping things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Have you ever done that?
R:  I have -- I have investigated it.  I've never done any.
L:  Well, a friend of mine does that in town and so she's -- I've gone on them with her and so I started to do those [NOISE] and the application process is you just get it out there, you know?
R:  Okay.
L:  And so I'd told other friends [NOISE] about it, especially when I don't wanna do that or something and --
R:  So -- so it is customary for that?
L:  And so, I'm, like, just, like, you know, I -- I haven't suffered anything from it or whatever, but then again, I do --
R:  I'm just -- I --
L:  -- all my [NOISE] banking and bill paying on my computer [LAUGH] so it doesn't really bother me.
R:  Yeah, w- we have started to do a lot of that, and that's really f- -- uh, I guess what, uh, uh, facilitated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- me using the internet so much.  We bought a -- a new computer for ourselves back at Christmas.
L:  Well, there's a site, I think it's called My Free Check or something like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, My Free Checks, I think, or Check Free or something and you set up, and they have a bunch of bills you can pay on there [NOISE] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's free for you, [NOISE] but the -- the -- but the best part is you can, like, say, get your bill today and it's due in one month --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- go in there today and say you wanna pay it in one month and put it down and it does it, whereas, like, I pay two other credit cards online --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I have to go on [NOISE] the date, if I don't forget --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know, or if I --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- remember a week beforeha- -hand, then I pay it a week beforehand, but I don't like that, so that place has multiple other bills that you can just go there, it's free, and they remind you if you have a bill coming.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can go right there [NOISE] and say, "Pay it" you know, in, you know, twenty days.
R:  Oh, that's neat.  I, uh, we, uh, we're not that advanced yet.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I've -- I -- we -- I am -- I despise computers and I -- I wouldn't have one unless I needed one for work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe I'm just a little too -- too simple.
L:  No, I just -- I -- I'm like, this is easy, and I'm not mailing something --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- then paying that.
R:  Sa- saving stamps and not -- and it being guaranteed payment.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not that the postal service is -- is error free, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've had things lost in the mail before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too.
L:  I know, I just really, really, um, really like that, it's very convenient and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't actually go to my bank all that often or anything, but a lot of other things I'm, like, "Okay, I can do that".
R:  So, you are in -- is it -- you said Gainesville, Florida?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that is the --
L:  The University.
R:  -- is -- yeah, the University of Florida, the campuses, is there a -- isn't that in -- ri- ri- -- like, right in the city [NOISE] limits?
L:  Ga- -- uh, UF?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's what I thought.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I've -- I've never been there but, uh, did -- did you go to school there, are you a big fan or --
L:  Mhm, yeah, I, um, ca- -- I grew in Saint Pete, Florida.
R:  Okay.
L:   And, um, it [NOISE] -- the only really hard part is there is no beach here.
R:  Ah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had -- I had a colleague from Saint Petersburg --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- when I was with -- when I was with A.G. Edwards.
L:  Oh.
R:  He, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we had all kind of training [MN] things we used to go to around the country, he --
