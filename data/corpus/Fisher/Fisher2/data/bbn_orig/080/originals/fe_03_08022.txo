L:  Uh, I'm from Texas.
R:  Texas?  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm calling from California.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's pretty far away. [LAUGH]
R:  Mike, can you hold on for, like, hold on one second?
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  Yeah, the volume on the phone is really low.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I really can't hear you that loudly, because my phone's really soft.  Can you speak just a little bit louder?
L:  Uh, yeah, sure, I can do that. [LAUGH] Can you hear me better?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay, um, so, talk about movies?
L:  Yeah, I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, yeah, um, you can go first if you want.
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.  Um, I don't know, I guess -- I don't really, uh, go out to the movie theaters much, I mostly rent movies and stuff, so --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- uh, how about you?
R:  Um, yeah, honestly, like, 'cause I go to college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't have that much money to spend, 'cause, like, movie tickets are so expensive nowadays.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I g- --
R:  So, I usually download, you know, like, off of Kazaa.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I do that too. [LAUGH]
R:  I download movies or, like, I just rent them, you know?
L:  Yeah, I, uh, I subscribe to, uh, Netflix so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- yeah, yeah, that actually -- it's -- they -- they're really fast with their delivery and everything so, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, what was the last movie you saw in the theaters?
L:  Oh, um, in the theaters?  Uh, I guess there's the new Matrix movie.
R:  Oh, the Matrix Reloaded? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I saw that one too.
L:  Yeah.  Um -- 
R:  Yeah, my -- the last movie I actually saw was, um, F- Finding Nemo.
L:  Oh, yeah, I've been -- I haven't gotten a chance to, uh, go see that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, actually it was so good.  It's worth your money.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  So, I guess [LAUGH] we answered --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the question already. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, uh, I don't know, so, um, [LAUGH] anything else about movies you have to say? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I like -- well, s- seeing a movie in the theater definitely is a different experience --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- but I don't -- I can't imagine myself going all the time, you know?
L:  Yeah, it's like it's -- it's gotten way too expensive now.
R:  True.
L:  And it's gone up a lot in price.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um --
R:  W- -- I, uh, do you go to college, or how old are you?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I go to college.  I go to, uh, University of Texas at Austin.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  How about you?
R:  Where are you originally from?
L:  Oh, I'm originally from, uh, South Texas but, uh --
R:  Really?  'Cause I can't hear -- I don't know if there's accents, like a Texas accent, but I can't hear it.
L:  Oh.  Um, oh, I guess some people have Texas accents, um, I don't really know.  Most people I know don't really have any accent or anything.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool, yeah.  Have you ever been to California?
L:  Um, I visited once, a while back, it was a long time ago, and San Francisco.
R:  Oh, really?  Did you like San Francisco?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I liked it a lot.  I liked, um, I liked the food. [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm real big on seafood, so that was -- yeah.
R:  Oh, you like seafood?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't think we're talking about movies anymore.  I'm sorry. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's okay, I don't -- yeah.  Uh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, I've never been down to Texas.
L:  Yeah, it's, um, it's a nice place, I guess.  It's, um, I don't know.  I guess it depends what you like.  Sometimes ...
R:  Mm, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  There's not much to say about Texas, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Yeah.  It's not much of a big tourist place or anything, I guess.  I don't know.
R:  What's your major in college?
L:  Oh, ah, I'm studying biochemistry.
R:  Bi- -- you're s- -- take -- you're studying biochemistry?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  How's that going?
L:  Um, it's pretty good.  You know, I'm, uh, I should graduate next semester so ...
R:  So, you're a fourth year?
L:  Uh, uh, I'm -- yeah, fourth year, yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.  You're almost done.
L:  How about you?
R:  Oh, I'm second year.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, and I'm studying business.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's cool.
R:  So, yeah.  Yeah --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I think we're supposed to talk about movies some more.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  I love movies, though.  Okay, who's your favorite actor and who's your favorite actress?
L:  Um, that's -- that's tough, I don't know.  I don't [SIGH] -- I guess I don't really have favorites, you know?  I -- I guess I -- I -- I'm more like, uh, like, you know, the kind of roles that they play, it just depends.  Like --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- how they are in a certain movie or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I agree, actually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you like the new Matrix?
L:  Um, I thought that it was okay but, I mean, like, the action sequences were cool and everything but, I mean, the plot sort of gets a little drawn out. [SIGH]
R:  Exactly, I -- I totally agree.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Actually, um, I thought the first one was better.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it wasn't as confusing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know, the first one, like, 'cause it was so -- it was so new, you know, you didn't know what to expect.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And the second one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was almost, like, you're pretty much seeing the same thing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it seems like -- I mean, I remember when the first one came out and, you know, everyone was, like, raving about it afterwards and this one, I mean, after -- after everyone's seen it, they're kinda like, you know, I mean, the -- sure, people are, like, complimenting it and everything, but there's a lot of people that are, like, "It's just the same thing and they're just --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- trying to make --" you know?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, no one really talks about it that much. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, movies. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, yeah --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- so -- so, let me think about other movies are coming.  Are there any other movies that are coming out that you wanna see in the theater particularly?
L:  Um, [SIGH] I don't really know.  I mean, I haven't seen anything that's really stuck out, like, you know, as a big --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh.
R:  Uh, have you heard of the movie, Twenty Eight Days Later?
L:  Um, yeah, yeah.  Actually, yeah, I'd like to see that.  It looks pretty, you know, I guess, scary. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  They said, like, it's like the scariest movie since the Exorcist.
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I haven't heard much about it.  I've just seen a few previews, but --
R:  Oh, really?  I haven't even seen any previews.
L:  Oh, yeah, I saw one on TV, but, yeah, that's about it. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Do you think it's worth it to see in the theaters?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I think -- I guess scary movies are -- are pretty fun to see in the theater 'cause, you know, the -- the whole sound and everything and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the dark room and I guess it's more of an experience.
R:  True.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't like these experiments, 'cause you have to talk for ten minutes about, like, one subject, but you can answer, like, the question --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- in, like, a minute.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Is this your first time?
L:  Um, yeah, it is. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't know.
L:  Yeah, no, it's --
R:  This is, like, my third time.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah, it's like -- only l- last week, the question was so dumb, like, [SIGH] it was, like, if they gave you a million dollars, [LIPSMACK] would you give up your best friend?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- never talk to your best friend again and, I mean, that's a yes or no question and then you can't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really keep talking about it, so I was so, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- okay, drowning.  Um --
L:  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  Anyway --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- movies.
L:  Hm.
R:  Great.  How'd you hear about this experiment?
L:  Oh, um, one of my friends told me about it.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Mm.
R:  La la la.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I guess, like, um, f- -- okay, theaters, seeing movies in theaters, I just think that it's all about the atmosphere, you know, you're paying for, like, being in a room where everyone's doing the same thing and you all, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you feel like you're, like, part of a -- I don't know, an experience sort of thing, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, that's -- that's true.  I mean, it's -- yeah, I think it's a lot about the -- the atmosphere that you get in a theater --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's different from just sitting, like, you know, in your living room and watching.
R:  True.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's also very comfortable to watch movies at home in general.
L:  Yeah, yeah, but, I mean, I think there's -- I mean, I guess the theater experience is a big thing and it's, like -- like, so many people like to get the whole, you know, surround sound speaker system and --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- big screen TVs and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  So, you don't have any favorite movies, by any chance?
L:  Um, not really, I guess.  I don't [LAUGH] -- I don't have any, like, favorites, I guess.  Um ... I don't know. [LAUGH] What about you?
R:  Do you like action movies better or drama or what?
L:  Oh, um, [SIGH] I like, uh, I guess dramas and, uh, horror movies.
R:  Horror movies?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, what's -- what are some horror movies that you like?
L:  Um ... oh, I guess I like, uh, mm, that's tough.  Yeah, I'm just blanking out. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  I haven't ever actually seen The Exorcist.
L:  Oh, yeah, I -- I thought that was -- that was a good movie.  It was, um, I don't really know how to describe it.  I guess, uh, [SIGH] I -- yeah, I don't know.  It's -- I guess it's something you sort of have to see, I guess.  But, um, I thought it was a really good movie.
R:  Yeah, a lot of people say that.
L:  Like the whole production and everything.
R:  Um, I heard it's really scary.  I've heard, like, the part where, like, the girl's walking down the stairs backwards or something.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, some of the scenes are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, just the things that -- that she does, it's -- it's just sort of -- yeah, it's intimidating.  I -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that movie is also very old so, I mean, do you [MN] is it pretty, like, cheesy now that you see it?
L:  Um, no, I still think -- I still think it's a good mo- --
