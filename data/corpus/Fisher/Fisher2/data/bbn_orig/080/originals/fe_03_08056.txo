R:  Solitaire?
L:  -- action games online as well, um, like pretty much anything -- anything that can be played online I've played and will play a lot.  Um, it's really interesting actually.  One of the games I play on, I guess it's called Bell Net, is Star Craft and I actually meet people --
R:  Hmm.
L:  -- from all over, um, just because they're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all on at different times and everything.  So ...
R:  I used to play --
L:  Pretty interesting.
R:  -- on Yahoo games, but I just haven't done a lot for a while online.  I have been online.  I just haven't played a lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you should come back.  I have -- yeah, I'm actually a member of, um, an online --
R:  Oh.

R:  All right.
L:  -- that runs on the Yahoo site.  It's, uh ...
R:  Okay. 
L:  Yeah.  Leaders dot com and they run, uh, Pea Knuckle, Gin, Dominoes, um, pretty much any -- most of the major leagues in Yahoo and they've actually branched out --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- into two other, um, online gaming leagues and I'm actually a tournament director --
R:  What's it called?
L:  -- for one of them.  So, if you're ever in a lounge in Yahoo and you see a bunch --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- of people talking with a bunch of like capital letters and everything --
R:  Congratulations.
L:  -- I'm one of those people now.  [LAUGH]
R:  You must play a lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've actually, um, been training now for a week.  So, it's just something fun to do --
R:  Do you know what you're gonna be doing now --
L:  -- in my free time whenever I'm around.
R:  -- that you've school besides playing on the Internet?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um [LAUGH], not really.

L:  Um, I'm an economics major.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's not --
R:  Oh, good luck.
L:  -- not that much out there right now for me.  Thank you.
R:  Canasta, um, I think I've played --
L:  Uh, what games did you play in Yahoo? 
R:  -- I've played Pea Knuckle.  Um, I've played mostly card games.  That's what I'm most comfortable with.
L:  [PAUSE] Yeah.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.  I guess I just --
L:  You should find more time to play.
R:  -- haven't thought about it for a long time.
L:  I like that.  I mean, I --
R:  Like oh, yeah, I could do that.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- have a lotta people ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It was actually, um, kind of interesting that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when the call came through it said online gaming --
R:  Well ...
L:  -- and that's all I've been talking about now for, you know, two, three days.
R:  Much better than boredom -- boredom.
L:  Yep.  Yeah.  Um ...
R:  Um, do you play any games on the computer that aren't on --
L:  I don't really know what else to [LAUGH] --
R:  -- the Internet?
L:  -- to talk about regarding games, um, you know, for ...
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I play a lot of, uh [inaudible] --
R:  I've played the Sim City series, um, the Sims.
L:  -- like, uh, Civilization, that series, um, the Sim City series.
R:  Yeah.  I do.  For a while it seemed like too much.  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you like it or ...?
R:  Oh, I haven't quite mastered Sim City yet.
L:  I'm really bad at it.  [LAUGH]  My cities always fail, like --
R:  Like, I was okay at -- at the others --
L:  -- almost right away.
R:  -- one to three [LAUGH], but Sim City four I haven't quite caught on to yet.  I -- I just haven't been on it much.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [PAUSE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Some, of my, um --
R:  I think it would help if may- -- all mayors before they become elected they have to play Sim City --
L:  -- my friends get into Sim City.
R:  -- for two weeks straight [LAUGH] --
L:  I'm not very talented at it, but ...
R:  -- and prove that they can manage a city.  [LAUGH]  I think that really might help them, you know --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if they had to manage -- okay, too much growth, not enough growth, how much you do.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You can have the businesses if you're gonna have ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Like what ...
L:  Yeah.  There's a few other games he also makes that I enjoy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I'm trying ...
R:  Yeah.  I know my brother's --
L:  They're pretty much all the --
R:  -- done Civilization.
L:  -- pretty much all the same, like --
R:  He has those.
L:  -- you either have a colony and you need to --
R:  I've never actually tried it.
L:  -- you know, be -- be building your colony or your city.
R:  I'd rather they be computers.  [LAUGH]  I do them basically to kill time.  They do 'em because they're there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My one brother got hooked -- God, I think in the eighties -- on one of the [inaudible] or something, one of the Star Wars games.  At this point he actually --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- broke through a level --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and posted them on the web.  [LAUGH]  He does all this stuff to get [several inaudible words] and I was just like okay.  Much too detailed for me --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- that I can handle.  No.  Actually he's got his master's in music composition and a bachelor in music competition and math.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  Did, uh -- did he go to school in -- in computer programming or ...?
R:  Uh, he does web page design out of his apartment for his job.  So ...
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And he's always been into the computers and games and video --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all of that stuff.  So -- but he can write them and he can write the music to go in the background and ...
L:  Wow!
R:  But it's much too complicated for me.  [LAUGH]  [PAUSE]  Mhm.  That's about how far I get.
L:  Wow!  That's be a great job.  Yeah.  If I actually work with computers I would love to --
R:  I think it'd be neat to be able to do that.
L:  -- but I'm not ...
R:  The other brother is actually a computer programmer.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, just putting --
R:  But he doesn't --
L:  -- putting the C.D. in, letting it run and, uh [LAUGH] --
R:  -- does play some games --
L:  -- but that's about it.
R:  -- but mostly he does programming on mainframe computers.
L:  [LAUGH] Wow!
R:  So, mhm.  Have you ever tried the Sim phone line?  I have, uh --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- I have it and I have not solved it and I've had it for fifteen months [LAUGH] or however long it's been out.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.  But if you get online with that I could be online a lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I haven't.  I don't think my computer can actually run that game, but --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I'm not positive.
R:  -- I haven't decided what I'm gonna do with it.  Keep it.  Sell it on eBay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did ya?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What did ya buy?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually I bought the Sim City four on eBay.  Yeah.  I did.
L:  Actually I -- I actually just bought, um, a game on eBay.
R:  I don't remember what I got it, but I know it was at a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- much cheaper than I could get it in the store at that point.
L:  [inaudible] I need a C.D. to play it.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] --
L:  Did you get it at a good price?
R:  -- 'cause you can get really good deals.
L:  [PAUSE]  [LAUGH] That's good.  Yeah.  Actually I look for a lotta my DVDs there too.  [PAUSE]  Yeah.  Mhm.
