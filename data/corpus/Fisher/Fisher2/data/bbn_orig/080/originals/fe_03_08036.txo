R:  Hi, my name's Linda.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi, so, what kind of computer games do you play?
L:  Um, not many, usually just Solitaire.  Um I usually don't have that much time to play computer games though.  What about you?
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Well, I like to play a little bit more enhanced computer games.  I really don't have much time either but sometimes I make some times just to get away --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I play some games like, ah, one of my favorites is Duke Nukem three D.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if you've ever heard of that?
L:  Mm, no.
R:  Ah, how 'bout, ah, what's that, Warlock?
L:  I think I've heard of that, I'm not really sure though.
R:  Yeah, it's a pretty good game.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, is Solitaire the only game you play? 
L:  Um, I think so.
R:  You play anything like Free Cell or Mine Sweeper?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Do you play games like Free Cell?
L:  Um, yeah, I -- I've played Soli-, I mean, Mine Sweeper before.
R:  Then you maybe can answer a question, what's the purpose of that game?
L:  Yeah, ah, um, [LIPSMACK] well, I don't really know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I have played just a few times but, um, ah, like a while ago --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- but, um, ah, I -- you have to, I don't even remember, it's kind of hard to explain.
R:  [LAUGH] You ever played --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- any games over the internet?
L:  Um, no, not -- not too many.  You?
R:  [NOISE] Well, actually, now that it's mentioned it, yes I have.  I don't know if you ever played, um, Solitaire against someone else --
L:  No, I don't --
R:  -- over the internet.
L:  -- I never.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  It's, ah, it's really interesting.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] So.
L:  Um.
R:  [NOISE] Do you have any children that play games?
L:  No, I don't have any kids.  Do you?
R:  [NOISE] No.  Um, unfortunately yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think I just heard one in the background.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, I sure do.  She likes playing, um, Blues Clues games.  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I work with kids --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- at a day care, they play Blues Clues --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and Carmen --
R:  Her --
L:  -- San Diego.
R:  Yeah, she -- that's too advanced for her, but she does like to play on Dora the Explorer.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Interactive games, that's her favorite.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, yeah my kids at school play, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- The Game of Life, um, what else do they play?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, [LIPSMACK] like Monopoly online, um, just, I don't know, things like that.
R:  So, do you agree what they say -- what they say about computer games, how they affect computer, ah, children's minds?
L:  Um, I think they're good for -- for kids.  Sometimes the -- the -- the games promote learning, um, like Math Blaster and all that kind of stuff.  I think it makes them aware --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, of -- teaches them how to use technology, so, yeah, I -- I would recommend them for kids.  I wouldn't have them play it for five hours a day every day but, I mean, half an hour or so I would.
R:  Oh, I totally agree.  Ah, I seen this show one time saying that, um, this one guy was playing computer games and he was so into the game, obsessed with the game that he killed his parents because of the game [NOISE] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I don't -- I don't think that's relevant --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] I don't think they even corresponds to the game [NOISE] to the game itself, I think it's just that, it depends on the person because [NOISE] I know people that play games like six hours a day and --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- it never affects them.
L:  Right, I guess it just a- affects different people at different times.
R:  [NOISE] It's -- I -- I really --
L:  Um.
R:  -- think it just depends on the person, how literal they take the games because, like I said, these are just games for entertainment, I mean, it's not really teaching you how to kill or combat or anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] And, so do you agree with them studies putting computers into the children's classrooms?
L:  Um, only for educational purposes, um, for, you know, reading and math, nothing -- not -- not actual game games, no.
R:  Yes, I would have to agree. 
L:  Yeah.  Are your kids, um, in school, like --
R:  Ah, no --
L:  -- or just are too --
R:  -- I have a pre sc- -- well, she's not really a pre schooler, she's like three.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  That's kind of young.
R:  [NOISE] Mm, yeah, but we're -- we're trying to teach her how to use computer games, she knows how to use the mouse and type but that's about it, she doesn't really know what she's doing.
L:  Ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, it's good to have them start young so that they know, you know, all --
R:  Oh.  Mm.
L:  -- about computers and stuff so.
R:  I'd agree to some point, but we limit her time on computers.
L:  Mhm, for how long a day.
R:  Well, we only let her use it for, like, thirty minutes a day.
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  'Cause even past that, I think it's a little bit excessive.  I use computers all day and sometimes at work I just play games because there's nothing else to do and it just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hurts your brain and your eyes, it's so strenuous.
L:  Right, do you -- do you use email too, like on the computers.
R:  Yeah, I -- I frequently use emails, um, chat rooms to just -- it -- it involves with my work.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I use email a lot too.
R:  Yeah, so what's the highest graphics game have you played?
L:  The highest what?
R:  Graphics.
L:  Um, w- w- -- I really, I don't know.  I don't play many computer games so I don't -- I don't know, um, really.  What about you?
R:  Well I've played, ah, the highest graphics is, um, I guess [LIPSMACK] you call VR, virtual reality.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Mhm.  It's not as real as they make it seem, it really isn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything's so box like, I don't know if you play, um, regular video games but it's like the same concept except --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's computer data oriented.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  Do you have that at home or at work?
R:  Oh, I used to have a friend that he had the VR game [LIPSMACK] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I -- and we played it all the time against each other.  We played this game, um, Tekken Three, it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was really cool for a while but it just gets boring and then not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really worth it after a while.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, mm, oh.
R:  My -- my infant, ha.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where are you from?
R:  [SIGH] I -- I am from Texas.  How about you?
L:  Oh, Boston.  Well, originally --
R:  Really?
L:  -- from New Jersey but I live in Boston right now.
R:  Oh, how cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you're going to university up there?  [NOISE]
L:  No, well I went to U Mass, um, but, yeah and then I moved home for a year and then I, ah, moved out to Boston with a couple of friends.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, oh [SIGH], bet it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- different from living at home.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] So when you lived at home did you play much computer games or did you own a computer?
L:  Um, hang on one sec.
R:  Sure. 
L:  [NOISE] Sorry.  Um, yeah, I had a computer at home, um and then when I moved out I used my roommates computer --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- but, ah, um, trying to even think what else I've -- I've played, but.
R:  [NOISE] So, have you had the privilege of using both computers, ah, like desktop and laptop?
L:  Yes, I definitely --
R:  Which would you [NOISE] --
L:  -- prefer desktop better than laptop.
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  Um, well, if -- if I have a mouse it, ah, to, um -- right, if I have a mouse on that laptop, it's a lot better but I don't like using a little screen and my finger and like pressing a little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- button, but, ah, I like desktops better.  What about you?
R:  I prefer laptops because I like the portability of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] De- -- on desktop it's so confined to one spot and you really can't go anywhere, even with voice activated commands --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] you really can't do much to it without, you know, using controls or mouse and it limits you, I really do think it limits you, and versus on laptop you could be with the family in one room or move to another room, it's very versatile.
L:  Right.
R:  But when it comes to games and things like that, 'cause I have a lot of accessories for my computer games, I prefer a desktop.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I like, I don't know, I -- yeah, both of them -- -at's true, that you can bring the -- the laptop all around, um, they have wireless internet too, which is cool --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I don't have that on my laptop now but you can, ah, be on the internet, like anywhere you bring your c- computer, it's just really cool.
R:  Right, that's that new feature that they're coming out with for laptops.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I heard about that [LIPSMACK].
L:  Yeah, that's really cool. My brother has that, it's cool.
R:  Yes, ah, the things they come up with technology, it's like, "What's next?"
L:  I know, I bet everybody will have, ah, wireless internet soon.
R:  Yeah, ah, my -- have you heard that new game, Sim City?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where it's like VR something, you become a person and it's in like and actual city you just log on to.  [NOISE]
L:  Right, I've heard of that.
R:  That is so crazy, I'd be scared of using something like that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you seen it?  I've only like heard about it, I haven't really seen it like up close, you know, but have you -- have you ever like see- -- have you seen people use it or?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I've, ah, haven't seen it personally used but it just frightens me, the fact of you, ah, living in a VR world [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  people pretending to be what they're not and then they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pretend they want to meet you and that they're a nice guy and you trust -- some people actually trust that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] and because of the game it might like be in contact with you, so I really don't trust.
L:  Right.
R:  So, no I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- haven't seen it personally.  They say it's cool, I've heard things, comments about it and stuff like that, but I really don't trust it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just -- it's too weird.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah it is.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE] So, have you ever played any of the other Sim City games like Sim City two thousand, Sim City roller coaster, whatever all those games are called?
L:  Um, a- --
