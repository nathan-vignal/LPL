R:  Hello, this is Joseph.
L:  Hi, Joseph.  This is Amy.  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.  Um, the topic of the day is not one that I'm really that familiar with.  
R:  Okay.
L:  I mean, I, ah, do most of my work on the computer, so I don't play many games on it.
R:  Okay.
L:  What about yourself?
R:  Ah, I don't play too many games.  I do play a few.
L:  Oh, okay.  What do you play?
R:  Um.  Right -- I run Linux, mainly, and they have a -- a game called Frozen Bubble on it.
L:  Okay.
R:  I play that, some.  And, um, Unreal Tournament, ah, Solitaire, games like that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Just -- just want something to pass the time.
L:  Yes, that's true.  I, ah, work two jobs, so I don't have that much time to pass the time.  But, um, I -- trying to remember -- I did -- when I first got my computer, I did play the computer game called Slingo.  It was like a Bingo type of thing.  And, um, that is like, interactive with other people.  So that's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, lets -- depends on if you get the numbers that they get.  And you don't win anything, you just keep playing it, and people have running conversations --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- along side of it.  But I don't generally get involved in the conversations.
R:  Yeah.  You just mainly just play the game part?
L:  Right, yes.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I played a few online games, but I usually, like you said, don't do the chat parts.  I'm too busy concentrating on the game.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  But then, I -- I always get scared 'cause I'd never know who I'm talking to anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm -- just will concentrate on the game.  I guess, ah, we're not one of their better picks, tonight, for computer games.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], anything else you play on the computer?
R:  Um, I guess not too much.  I play some, um -- oh, that ah, console games.  I play some of those on the computer, too.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, ah, like Nintendo games, here.  Things like that.  Um --
L:  Yeah, I have the old Nintendo from years ago, that -- I still play Mario on it every once [LAUGH] in a while.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  I've -- I've gotten that, ah, play on my computer, every once in a while.  Um, I have a --
L:  And there's a game that I know that's on my palm.  It might be on the computer, too.  Um, called Bejeweled.
R:  Is it like Tetris?
L:  Kind of like Tetris.  It's like you have to get three in a row, and then it drops, and, um, more come up.  So if they consider that a hand held computer, I --
R:  Mm.
L:  That, I play.  'Cause I have it with me all the time, so --
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  Again, just to pass the time [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I p- play a few -- got some arcade games on here.  Um, one called Breakout.  I think that was a remake of an old one.
L:  Okay.
R:  Using the [inaudible].
L:  I've heard of it.
R:  Yeah.  And, ah, I have a brother that likes to play some of those educational games.
L:  Oh, well, that's good.
R:  Where you gotta, ah, match things together, and, um, have to -- oh, there's all kinds of different stuff on there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it keeps him kinda busy.
L:  I have ah, ah, several nieces, but one of them, right now, is at the age where she's into those lake leap frog games.  The learning tools that are games on the computer, on the CD --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- roms that they, um --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  It r- -- it's a really lear- -- a learning tool.  More so than a game.
R:  Yeah.  I guess, as long as they think it's fun, they -- if they know that it's educational, they probably wouldn't play it.
L:  Oh, of course not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Of course not.
R:  Huh [LAUGH] [NOISE].  I used to --
L:  And then the older kids are way past --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- me in the games.  On the computer and off the computer.  They're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- much more computer literate than their Aunt Amy [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they're -- I got a brother and he's -- he's passed me where -- when I was at that age.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I still know more than he, ah, does, but it won't take too long, I don't think.
L:  For him to pass you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  My nieces were playing games on the computer when they were like, four and five years old, and that's when the computers were just starting to come out.  These are the older nieces, and they loved just getting on the computers and matching, you know, a square with a square.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, I'm like, okay, I --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- don't even have a computer.  This was, you know, many years ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I really didn't want anything to do with the computer.  I shied away.  I'm a social worker, and then things started getting computerized, so I had to get one, and -- so I do have fun with it, and play some of the games that I find on it.
R:  Yeah, I've -- I started back when, ah, the use of the cassette tape, as to a floppy disk.  I remember programming games in.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I had a book that had some examples.  I'd program in a game, and play it for a while, and, ah -- also the Space Invaders.  I had that.  I played that.
L:  I think my brother had that.
R:  Yeah.  It's [NOISE] -- you know, today it would seem kind of silly, getting a game like that, but back then, that was something.
L:  That was the coolest thing going [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah.  So you must be really good at computers, then.
R:  Yeah, I've, um, actually gonna start up a PC shop here.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Then -- yeah.  Got some websites up, and they don't really, I guess, deal with games that much.  But I do all the, you know, the other stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, never been a big gamer.  I mean, I don't go to the computer just to play games.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, when I'm building a computer I'll be sure to pick parts that'll be able to play games, but it's not -- that's never been the focus of it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But, um --
L:  I use the computer at work, now, and so when I come home, I, nine times out of ten, won't even turn the computer on [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  But, ah, the games is the topic, so, ah --
R:  Well, I s- -- have you played any, ah, games at Yahoo, like, ah, internet chess, or checkers?  Anything like that?
L:  No.  I honestly don't know any of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, um, I -- I -- I'm on AOL.  I do have a Yahoo name for email, and stuff, but that's at work, and I generally don't have time to go playing around on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I would love to.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I just -- just get real busy, and I'm -- as I said before, I guess I'm not that, um, computer literate to be able to go -- I mean, I can surf, but that's about it.  So do see games from time to time, but I haven't, um, done the, you know, used any of it.  And I'm getting a call in, but I'm just going to ignore it.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I don't even have call waiting, so I don't have to worry about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um, I play a few of those games online.  It -- it's kinda fun to, ah, play with someone else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I did play, when I was at my friends house, who, ah, lived in Puerto Rico.  She had Sim City.  It's not really a game.  It's a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a creation.  I don't from what else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you say [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I -- I've played that, and games like that before.
L:  Yeah, so that I had fun with, for a while.  That was, um -- that was interesting and she had found like, all the master cheater -- cheat ways to get in, or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I plugged that in.  It's like, I had all the money I wanted, and, ah, was able to build cities, and have fun with that.  So that was fun.  So that, I guess, I've played.
R:  Yeah.  I've played some games like that.  Um, played some role playing games --
L:  Oh really?  What -- what -- what kind?
R:  Um.  Um, they had one, I guess it's called role playing, where the -- ah, called Black and White.  And --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you basically play god, and you decide if you're gonna be a good god, or a bad god.
L:  Wow.
R:  And then see how, ah, your, ah, ah, how the people react.  Now you can --
L:  Okay.  I never heard of that one.
R:  You can help 'em along, or you can be mean to 'em.  You can go 'em around, you can save 'em, you can, ah, you know, kinda stuff like that.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, um --
L:  Give 'em a couple of wind storms, tornados [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I think you could do stuff like that, too.  It's been a while since I've played it, though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, you could, ah, I think you could do stuff [NOISE] like that.  Um, but it still wasn't an on line game, though.  Is -- I think you pretty much just played that by yourself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I've played a few games where you just run around, shooting, and you can play those online, too.  But it -- it -- sometimes it's more hassle than it's worth.  So I just play the computer.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Sometimes when I do go online it's -- I've seen my friends, you know, play games and I'm just like, you know, okay.  I -- I'm -- don't even have the patience for this.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, let's see.  What other games?  Ah, played Minesweeper a lot?  [NOISE].
L:  No.  I think my sister had.  She's talked about that.
R:  Yeah.  I can --
L:  Yeah, see, I --
