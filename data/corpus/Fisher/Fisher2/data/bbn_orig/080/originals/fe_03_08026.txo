L:  Well, I know I [MN] --

R:  Yeah, I'm not that great with cans so I have to do [inaudible].
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  And then I, you know, like, some people are really good, you know, and I kind of [LAUGH] they're never laid back like now.  I stayed on that, too [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  They're always good like that though.
L:  Well, Pacman, uh, was a game that's played at the, uh, video parlors, is that right?
R:  Right, right, yeah.
L:  Uh, I would imagine they probably have, uh, home games, too, now, you know.
R:  Hey, yeah, uh, sure.
L:  I'm sure they got everything nowadays.
R:  Yep.
L:  Um, they have, uh, racing cars, right?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And [MN] --
R:  I'm lousy at that, too [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, right.  Me, too.
R:  When I was out on the road code I -- I used to them every once in a while and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I crash a lot so --
L:  Yeah.  Solitaire is a good game.  I like that.  Sometimes I play that.
R:  What -- what's that?
L:  Solitaire.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I play --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I play, um, the -- I have this one game pack.  There's, like, about forty eight different kinds of solitaire so I play a couple of different kinds.
L:  Yeah.  They're -- d- d- they're good games.
R:  I like -- I like that.
L:  Yeah.  If you don't want to [MN] stay with [inaudible], oh, well
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's pretty good.
R:  Well, sometimes --
L:  You -- 'cause you have --
R:  -- I play games and watch TV at the same time.  Huh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause I have my TV set up right by my computer so, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I can --
L:  All right.  That sounds like the one also.  Well, okay.  So --
R:  -- and sometimes I play games when I'm supposed to be sleeping, you know, like when I'm doing -- working over night so when I come home in the morning I'm supposed to go to bed.  I don't.  I just say, "Oh, it's only one game", and then it's, like -- ends up being a dozen games.  Well --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, like it's a l- --
R:  -- [inaudible].
L:  Right.  It's, like, eleven o'clock and you know you're supposed to be going to bed soon, right? You got to get up but you're still --
R:  Right.
L:  -- playing.
R:  Only with me it's, "All right, yeah.  I got to go to bed, go to sleep" but the next thing --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Now that you're interested I think, keep it.
R:  Huh?
L:  Say the game you -- catches your interest --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- like a solitaire --
R:  -- it's just really addictive, it really is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, like to me it is, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- 'cause I know I'll -- I'll say, "If I'm just going to go to the spare room just to play one game", and then it's like, "Oh, I'll just go and play another one and another one", huh --
L:  Be like just one and then I'll go to sleep.
R:  Just one more and then I'm out of here but I don't do anything.
L:  Well, I think can I have just one more.
R:  What's that?
L:  I- it's like it can be when I wanted a cookie; you can get one more piece here --
R:  Yeah, right, just one more.
L:  -- and then you're --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.  It's not.  It's like --
L:  -- just one more [MN] --
R:  -- I have them.
L:  Well, we're adults and, um, and there's nobody to say no to us so [NOISE] then you get up and they have to name your [inaudible] so --
R:  I can understand why it's not --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- allowed at work and it's like, oh, well, if you have to have it at all and you're doing something on the computer, you know, you want to go to sleep.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, that's why you know some big kids be calling up and staying up all night playing these games --
R:  Yeah, they are [MN].
L:  -- [inaudible] and in the summer time, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- okay.  That sounds cool.  So, we just talk about games to each other?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I said -- that's what I understand --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- very hard to understand it because it was, like, there was such a severe echo so --
L:  Right, right.  There was a heavy echo.
R:  Yeah --
L:  If --
R:  -- but that's what I understand it was, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- just talking about different, you know.
L:  Oh, interesting.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Where am I calling from?
L:  Mhm.
R:  New Jersey.
L:  New Jersey?
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  I'm calling from, uh, Manhattan.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  I'm at work.
R:  [NOISE] Well, it's -- it's -- uh, it just must be just for this area then.
L:  Yeah, maybe they may trip the whole area you're in.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, I live on Guyland but I'm at work now, so --
R:  Oh [LAUGH] Oh, okay [LAUGH].
L:  -- so, um --
R:  Just like me, play with the computer at work.
L:  Right, but I -- I thought when I called up this morning; remember they tell you to call up after two o'clock?
R:  Yeah?
L:  I thought that -- that, uh, it was just me at the m- -- but when they called -- called up I said between nine when I got home --
R:  Right [NOISE].
L:  -- you know, but our, uh, but now we're talking.  I call up after two and I -- I've got you on the phone and we're going to be talking for ten minutes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I wonder if they're still going to call us at home.
R:  Uh, you know what?  I'd forgotten all about that --
L:  Hm, oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's that they had said that they would call us but, uh, what was the reason they were going to call us [NOISE]?
L:  Uh, to have a ten minute talk with us --
R:  Oh, well, uh, no, that wasn't --
L:  -- and then, uh, and then, uh, they were [MN] -- y- you --
R:  No.  I thought it was just, uh, I -- it seems like I remember something like that or that that they may -- about to tell me something about that but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, all because -- all I have here on my paper is, uh, all about system or -- and my pin number --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the calls, so --
L:  What --
R:  -- it should be okay or else I don't know.
L:  -- [MN] and then they say, uh, w- we're supposed to have three ten minute conversations but not in the same day because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's different topics every day.
R:  Right.
L:  So today's topic is computer games.  All right.  Cool.  I read that I think I'd like to -- all the participant like you then, uh, that interviewer --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that --
R:  Um [NOISE] --
L:  -- yeah, makes my -- much --
R:  I know, uh, [inaudible] is when I was in Boston they had, like, a lot of persuaded to go to Maxims --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- and would bring a group of people in.  This is kind of gone off computer games so they're probably going to love us.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we came, we would bring clients and you'd listen to conversations and make comments --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, like they had a new product.  You were always making the comments on the product.
L:  Mm.
R:  It was kind of fun.  I really liked that [NOISE].
L:  Good.  Well, that's much like someone, uh -- pretty dec- -- know [LIPSMACK], um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I know adults, kids, little kids, they all, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.  My grandchildren, man, they, uh, like, they're so cl- -- they're -- they're so computer literate and they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, I mean, my grandson is, like, three and a half years old and he can watch a computer and they have their little games and my grandchildren all [inaudible] try and do the same thing.  They have their little games and they have the loon, tools, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm going, "Ah" [LAUGH]!

L:  So, the kids --
R:  -- all the words.
L:  -- all the rules and the strategies, you know, even at a young age --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, but that's it.  I kind of think, uh, they're a good idea these video games.
R:  Same for you [inaudible] to sick bay, I mean, like, uh, you know, you exercise brains so that's why I do it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, 'cause it's quite a challenge and really brain exercise.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  You know.
L:  The challenge and the -- [MN], uh, if you can't sleep, um, uh, it's like doing the crossword puzzle.  You know, you play the games at eleven o'clock and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's the team -- twenty minutes to do that, uh, you get sleepy -- gets drowsy.
R:  Yeah, right --
L:  Yeah [MN].
R:  -- or reading a book.  A whole lot more fun than reading a book [NOISE] so --
L:  Uh, you know, read a book, well, it [MN] I've tried reading a book to go to sleep in a while.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's the same because you get interested in the book and the plot and then you want to see what happens next --
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  -- and the vide- -- uh, vid game, uh, what's happening next is that happened six minutes ago --
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  -- so -- yeah --
R:  Yeah, read a book to go --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- snooze -- spend all night staying awake reading the book because it's so exciting you can't put it down --
L:  Yeah, yep.
