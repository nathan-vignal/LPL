R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  [NOISE] Hello.  This isn't very clear.  I hope we don't have that problem.  My name is Ruth Myers and I live in Florida.
L:  And I'm Jim Bordeaux.  I live in Brooklyn, New York.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.  Uh, do you have a computer?
L:  Uh, yeah, I do.
R:  Oh good. [NOISE]. Uh, I have a computer but I have to admit it.  I have, um, [LIPSMACK] never played games on it since I, uh, went to class and took lessons to learn the computer and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I didn't even know how to use a mouse so the instructors said the best place for you to start is on Solitaire.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And that's the only time I've played them.  I, uh, never won a Solitaire and I didn't do so well. Do you play 'em?
L:  Oh, I play Solitaire and I also -- I teach Solitaire in, um, [NOISE] hub games like checks on -- on the computer's CD Rom [NOISE] to introduce people to the PCs.  I am an instructor of the computers.  I teach [NOISE] the introductory courses to computers, and that's the best way [NOISE] to introduce people to learn the function of the computer [NOISE] by playing these games voluntarily because it includes a lot of hand movement and use of mouses.  [NOISE] I tried other -- other games, um, I like to play on the internet 'cause I'm up to date with the whole cable and, um, you know, high speed internet, I guess.  It's that -- dial up modems.  So, I -- I just buy the CD Roms and I play like that.  I just -- [several inaudible words] I think the simulator games, sort of the fun and games of Microsoft, um, Flights in there, Two Thousand, or Train Simulator.  Anything that simulates real life , I like that.  I -- did you ever hear of any of them?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, no I haven't.  Uh, do you have to, uh, buy these CD Roms?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Pretty much.
R:  Are they expensive?
L:  Uh, it depends on what -- how old they are.  Um, basically if you buy the latest ones which I don't now because [inaudible] violated them so you have to keep out of your computer being hacked or accessed to playing with [several inaudible words] games.  You know, but I just buy the later version one because my computer is about -- I bought it last year, [NOISE] so the best time with a lot of video games [several inaudible words] and private because sort of like games are now, it will be obsolete and then it wont -- wont work as well.  And upgrading costs more money like just, you know.  Home video games are -- can come out on video, um, technology, and I -- you know.  These computers that over a year don't have that, you know, physically, and, um -- especially now that -- that games are very detailed and are fixed.  Um, like Medal of Honor and all other games too, and then these games take up like two gigabytes of memory -- just a lot of memory for that of a computer that you bought two or three years ago, and now it comes down they're like sixty, eighty gigabytes, so it's pretty -- you know, it's really nothing.  So, you know, it's so disappointing that in the market there is something new coming out, and it's hard to keep [several inaudible words].  You have to be on edge.  You have to, you know, have actually a lot of funds and access these software zones and hardwares.  Or to play the fun and games or else you'll have a -- slow, you know, your games will keep stopping and keep freezing up and you'll get frustrated s- just playing overall.
R:  What's the, um, kinda average price of a CD -- one of the older ones?
L:  Of the old -- older ones you got, like, to, um, and I try hard to pick these up in any kind of electronics store.  I don't know what else that they have them for, they'll have them all the time.  Um, they have -- but they have them much ranged from anywhere from ten to nineteen dollars because, you know, the new ones that have come out they're about -- they're from about anywhere from forty eight to sixty dollars a CD.
R:  Oh, sh- --
L:  So, they're pretty expensive.  So, some of them are kinda obsolete or they're [inaudible] if you buy them used, it's like if you go to Uncle M [several inaudible words] maybe four or five dollars a piece, and you don't get like a warranty or [inaudible] more than that for something.  So, that's -- it's -- they're pretty good though -- ones, though.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, how would they be for, um, keeping, um, say an elderly person mentally alert?  Would they help their minds so that, you know, they go dormant playing these games?  I mean, would they be geared for the purpose?
L:  Well, like studies have shown that most strategy games, um, developed a lot more in a child's mind if -- if -- I read a article out of it, you know, um, strategy games developing the -- [LIPSMACK] the mind of a child more than they do when they do more critically -- a elder person in the strategy games it helps them to maintain with critical thinking and, you know, just, uh, just involves the minds -- sends them off really so you don't, you know, you just don't watch it where you have to think a lot.  You have to remember clues and you have to remember places you went, and you know, the strategy games involve a lot of thinking and it takes [inaudible].  It definitely trains your mind, and as long as you train your mind, you shouldn't go blank.
R:  Uh, I heard on TV that, um, there -- they could promote violence, or they're games that could have a lot of violence connected with them?
L:  They do.  There are some games that promote violence such as Grand Theft Auto, which is -- has seen a lot of controversy.  Um, it involves shooting people or getting forced so they have to [inaudible] cars and things.  More points and you know, the more cops you shoot the more money you have and that -- and there are a lot of, um, games out there like that and they [several inaudible words] Auto started it, and, a lot of games not involved in the same scenario because of the high demand, and, and, um, teenagers are -- are demanding schemes because they get a kick out of this.  Uh, someth- -- and but then can do realize playing it on the video games, and you can get a kick out of it because, you know, it's an unch- -- una- -- unachievable thing some time, and they accomplish it by being in a video game.  But as far as promoting it and part of the focus is where people blame it's due to video games for once but that has been thrown out of court.
R:  And yet children, uh, would -- does this, uh, help with hand eye coordination?
L:  Hand and eye coordination.  It would help if -- if you had software such as, um, [LIPSMACK] action list or probably a controller.  Um, [several inaudible words] a strategy game, you just move the mouse a little and -- and that the person but if you, um, [MN] -- r- -- um, play more of the arcade variants of simulators such as the Flight Simulator where it might pay, where it won't matter if a lot of concentration and thinking, and eye to hand coordination and -- I was thinking of guiding the plane into the right path, and remembering a lot of speed and high altitude and, another kind of advanced game [several inaudible words] you get a hang of it.  And once you get a hang of it, you get good at it and you develop a -- a -- you know, a [several inaudible words] a hand eye coordination.
R:  Uh, do these games help, uh, say the -- well, anybody from getting lonely?  I mean, like you're stuck at home for the evening, and you wanna put in your time doing something pleasurable, and do they get out their CD Roms and start playing these computer games for that purpose?
L:  Well, that's what I do.  I have a couple at home and, um, sometime if the others really boring I have [inaudible] some games in two months when I was really [several inaudible words] school and work and just popped them in and, you know, because of them, yeah, it does occupy time and [MN] depend on how much you get into them what is your -- your much, um, your, uh, your -- your taste in games -- it's from flying, driving or -- or role playing, you know, and you just kind of doze into that, you know.  It's a kind of a -- a reality that I always wanted to pursue because I was one behind a little bit, you know, really [several inaudible words] be patient in the future so I play the games because of the [several inaudible words] come to it.  I mean, you have the, um, whether to pursue anybody you see just like now.  I want to pursue that.  I just want to, like --
R:  [several inaudible words] vicariously do it?
L:  Huh?
R:  You can kind of vicariously do something that, uh --
L:  Have you ever wanted --
R:  -- you send more to it?
L:  -- I haven't wanted to die but recovered [LAUGH].  Didn't think them provide us [LAUGH] an income or [MN] feasible so, you know, it's [several inaudible words] mentality, you know, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Fool.  Some people, like, who won the [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] go and buy [several inaudible words] and play and -- and actually do that, you know [several inaudible words].
R:  You don't need a service provider, I mean, to go.  You don't need to go to the Internet to play these games do you?
L:  No.  They just -- you don't even use Internet access.  Basically some games you just play and follow.  Sometimes it's fun if you have a game and somebody else has bought the same game and you could all [several inaudible words] and you can play it --
