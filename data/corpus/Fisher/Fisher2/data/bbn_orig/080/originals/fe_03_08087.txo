R:  Hi.  This is Audrey Togan[?] and I'm in Oskaloosa, Iowa.  I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- originally from Arkansas.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.  This is Mickey Hammon[?] and I am from Vancouver, Washington. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello? [PAUSE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, are we supposed to, like, [NOISE] discuss the topic back and forth?
R:  Well, I thought there was gonna be more people online.  I was just waiting for all the other people to introduce themselves.  Is it just me and you?
L:  I guess so.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I have to admit that we live in this little town and I do get our -- our paper, um, on Sunday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I always read that but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't stay up to date on current events as much as I probably should.
L:  You know, neither do I and I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- live in a large town. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I do -- I don't really like CNN but I do, ah -- I do watch the news.  Um, but I try to watch the national news at least, ah, three or four times a week.
L:  Oh.  I get main- -- I get most of mine from the internet actually -- from internet news.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like that better.  It doesn't seem so depressing if I read it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That -- that's, kind of, interesting.  I am on the internet all day long at work so ...
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Yes, I'm on the internet constantly. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] It sounds like you have a -- a little one there?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, I do -- I have a five year old and an eleven month old.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's neat.
L:  Do you have any children?
R:  Yes, I do but mine are much older.  My --
L:  Oh.
R:  My youngest is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, will be fourteen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in about a w- -- about a week.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  W- wow.  So, how did you hear about this survey thing? [NOISE]
R:  Um, actu- --
L:  This study?
R:  Actually, I heard about it on, ah, a chat thing that I'm on.
L:  Through refunding?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Refunding Make Cents maybe?
R:  Yes.
L:  Tha- that's where I heard about it too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, how neat.  You know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I used to get the magazine all the time and just this last year I just went to the online, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't get the magazine anymore because I was just -- you know, I was just getting so much --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, paperwork and I -- I have a problem with clutter. [LAUGH]
L:  A- -- yes.  See, I get it and it's the first thing I do, I try and [NOISE] -- that night I sit down in my bedroom and I try and read it from cover to cover.
R:  Oh, me too.  Oh, I lo- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I love to read it all.  And, yeah, I learn a lot.  I really do.  Now, where do you live?  Did --
L:  Vancouver, Washington.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, now, do you have any, like, double coupons --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- triple coupons?
L:  Well, some, not too much -- I wish we had more.  I get so envious of all the people I read about.  Um, we get, like, in our normal -- in our weekly ad, um, [LIPSMACK] at Safeway they put out four of 'em and then every now -- like, once a month they put out, um, super doubles where they'll double up to twenty but that's about it.  It's not very much. [NOISE]
R:  Well, they don't -- wh- where we moved from in Arkansas, they would have some good stuff.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It always doubled --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every store --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- every little town.  But here in Iowa, nobody does.  So ...
L:  Oh.
R:  But I guess we should get back to the topic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but --
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I do read my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- chat on there every day.
L:  So do I.
R:  You know?  So, I'll -- I'll look for you.  I mean, I don't -- I read it every day, I don't always --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, put something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on there but I do always read it.
L:  That's -- that's how I am.  That's how I am.
R:  But --
L:  We just had a -- a store here that, ah, did unlimited doubles and triples and, oh, my gosh, I was in hog heaven.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Except for I got there and there was no selection whatsoever.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was horrible. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that is.  Well, I can imagine that.  You know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- after very long but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] -- yeah, it was just -- it was terrible when we moved --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here.  But, um ... so --
L:  Oh, yeah, the topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, the topic.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  F- -- [PAUSE] I don't --
L:  So, do you re- -- do you read the paper or anything?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I read -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I have to admit, I do like [NOISE] -- like our Des Moines Register and I do like to read the, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I read it on Sunday and I don't like -- you know, and not a lot of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- feature stuff.  I do like to know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what's going on.  And I think it's important.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  People do need to know what's going on in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the world and sometimes it's so easy, you just wanna --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put your head in the sand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause then it's, you know, like, "Well, what can I do?"
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know?  I get really frustrated, you know, with the politicians and everything because you get angry at 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you wanna say, well, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no one's -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know that people d- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can make a difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  I- --
R:  -- sometimes you feel like you can't. [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yes.  Yes.  I feel like that constantly.  My husband reads the paper more than I do.  I just -- I don't know.  It's -- it's all so depressing that I try and stay away from it.  I know that's horrible but it's just how I feel.
R:  Well, I do like to listen to the news, you know?  And I mean, there's -- there's different news programs out there but I'll just, kinda, listen -- and you don't get a lot.  I mean, if something really is major happening, you're gonna know it no matter what.  No matter how you get your news you'll know it.  But, you know, it just seems like it's either the news media just go wild over some story or nothing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  M- m- -- like when the -- the stuff in the Middle East started --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was just everywhere.
R:  And it's almo- -- it's almost like when it's something tragic they -- you know, that's their livelihood and, you know, it's almost that they really enjoy it.
L:  What do --
R:  I- --
L:  -- you mean?
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the news and everything, I mean, when they're on there, like, you know, sometimes twenty four hours a day and -- and it's, like, you know, "Give these poor people a break" if something bad has happened to someone, you know?  But sometimes they don't wanna let it go.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  I feel the same way.
R:  But ...
L:  With little ones it's, kinda, hard 'cause they don't wanna listen to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they don't wanna listen to it and we'll have, you know, cartoons or something going on or -- Blues Clues is a big one.  And so, it's -- for us, it's a little -- a little hard to get the TV to turn on to something 'cause we're always doing something around but we discuss it -- we discuss things that are going on at work and that's -- through my husband and work is, pretty much, where I get most of my information.
R:  But, you know, with a -- with children, you don't want them exposed to a lot of the news.
L:  Well, now, I don't know.  I mean, like, with the -- with -- when nine eleven happened, we had a lot of people telling us that we shouldn't be having my son -- who was three at the time -- um, exposed to it and we -- we just thought, um, the more he knows the better.  And he's a, ah -- we think he's gonna be a little fire- firefighter when he grows up.  He's just -- he's so -- he's such a little activist with firefighting.  He was so mad at the screen when he saw it, just yelling and, "Oh, who could hurt my firefighters?"  And -- so, we thought it was -- we thought it was good for him to know what was happening.  That was just our personal opinion.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Um, [NOISE] [PAUSE] well, I'm glad everything has settled down, you know?
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Back to [NOISE] whatever normal is.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Yeah.
R:  But ... I don't know.  Have they, um ... w- -- have you heard any more about that Laci Peterson?
L:  Oh, no, I haven't heard -- what's that?
R:  About her husband?  I mean, it -- he really looks guilty [NOISE] to me.
L:  What -- I didn't hear --
R:  But, um --
L:  I don't know about that.  Can you --
R:  You know, the -- the lady, she disappeared when she was pregnant.
L:  Oh.  No, actually, I haven't heard about that.
R:  She disappeared right around Christmas and, um, you know, he was supposed to be helping 'em look and everything and then all at once, um, there w- -- well, yeah, they arrested him and he had two or three different girlfriends and -- and she, ah, was -- p- -- they finally found her body floating in some --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- yeah, some lake and, um, he had a -- he has a boat and he had taken the boat out [NOISE] that direction --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff.  You know, [NOISE] it was [NOISE] -- it [NOISE] -- a lotta circumstantial evidence -- that's all it is right now but ...
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Unfortunately --
R:  I don't know.  It didn't look good for him.
L:  Unfortunately, the only person's gonna know is him.
R:  Yup.
L:  Yeah.  It's sad.  It's really sad.
R:  Yeah.  She was, you know, young and she was pregnant and just -- I think it was almost time for the baby and -- you know?
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  It was really, really sad.  I just can't believe you didn't -- you didn't hear about Laci Peterson.
L:  No, I haven't heard about that.
R:  H- her picture was on every cover of every magazine in the grocery [LAUGH] store. [LAUGH]
L:  See, I try and stay away from those things.  I just don't -- I don't know.  I'm just [LIPSMACK] ... my husband says I'm just outta tuned.  He says, "You're so outta touch".  It's, like --
R:  You ask your husband -- I bet he's heard about --
L:  Oh, I bet.
R:  -- Scott and Laci Peterson.  Yeah.
L:  I bet.  If -- if the TV's not on, um, cartoons where -- it's normally on one of those, ah, detective -- those crime story --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- type of things.  Yeah.  We're -- we're, kind of, addicted to those.
R:  How about -- how about Life- Lifetime?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, now, [SIGH] I can't -- those are more if -- if I wanna watch something and I -- I never get the TV.
