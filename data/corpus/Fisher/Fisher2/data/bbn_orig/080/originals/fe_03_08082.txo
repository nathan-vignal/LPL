L:  Hi, my name is Joan Curtis.
R:  Hi, my name is Penny.
L:  Hi, Penny.  [LAUGH]
R:  I had a terrible connection with my recording just now.  I was afraid the whole phone call was gonna go like that.
L:  Oh, really?  Can you hear me okay?
R:  I can hear you just fine.  The other part though it was, uh, big echoes the whole time they were talking.
L:  Oh, are you on a cell phone?
R:  No.  I'm not.  I'm on a handheld.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm on a cell phone.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, I'm glad that you can hear me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No problems there.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how do you get your news?
R:  Oh, boy, probably T.V., newspaper, um ...  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Is that about it?  Yeah.  I -- I, um [SIGH] -- I -- I go in spurts, you know, where I don't hear --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the news for a really long time and then someone will go oh, did you hear about --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- such and such and I'll go no, you know?  And then I'll kinda get connected again.
R:  Yep.
L:  But I usually read it --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- in the paper for local news and then, um, I -- I read -- I like to read Internet news.  Um, if I'm gonna decide to get, uh, caught up in the news sometimes --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- what I'll do is go on the Internet and read it or else, yeah, C.N.N. and a lotta -- there's a lotta news, um -- Fox has one -- I mean, lots of news companies have their stuff right online.  So, you can just read what -- whatever it is they're broadcasting.  A.B.C., N.B.C.  [LIPSMACK]  So, that's kind of quick and easy and then I can just pick --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- out what I wanna know about, um, and then I also --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- listen to the radio.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I'm not a big T.V. watcher.  I -- you know, my husband -- every day --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when I come home from work my husband has the news on the T.V. and I -- I just -- I just tune --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- try to tune it out --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- because it's just really annoying to me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I always end up with cartoons on because --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I have three little kids.  So, it's always cartoons, cartoons, cartoons --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and probably by the end of the day, into the evening I've had it with cartoons.  So, it's like okay, time for some big people T.V. --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for a little bit [LAUGH], whether it's news and anything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  Do you, um -- does your news come on at night --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- at like eleven?  Yeah.  That's when ours does too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's too late for me.
R:  That's my down time.
L:  I can't stay up that late and watch.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's my real down time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm usually laying down sleeping.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  Week news about six o'clock --
L:  Like if -- if I can make it.
R:  -- or eleven o'clock.  Yep.  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  Are you in Eastern time zone?  Mhm.  Yeah.  We are too.  I used to live in -- in, uh, um ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I guess that'd be central.  It came on at ten.  [COUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which I really didn't mind then I could stay up and usually watch it.  But, gosh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when it starts at eleven, you know, and it's not done 'til --
R:  It makes for a long day.
L:  -- midnight it's like oh.
R:  Mhm.  Yep.  And then we just have a small paper here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, you know -- nothing real big.  Um, well, we're not a real small town, but --
L:  Oh, really?  Just a small town paper?
R:  -- I mean, it's nothing that anybody's probably ever heard of.  It's the Jackson Citizen Patriot.  Yep.
L:  Oh, really?  What is it?
R:  Are you really?  [LAUGH]  And I'm right in Jackson.
L:  Oh, in Michigan.  Oh, okay.  I'm in Kalamazoo.  Mhm.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Isn't that funny --
R:  You're kidding me?
L:  -- because, um, you're the second person that I've talked to --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- on these calls that was from Michigan.  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  The first person was too.
R:  No.  You're the first person I've had in Michigan.
L:  So, I was wondering if they were trying to compare like Michigan --
R:  Everybody else I've had has been pretty far away.
L:  -- expense or something.  Um ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.  The one girl I talked to that was far away was in New York.
R:  Huh.  Well, you know, this is the first call --
L:  But the other lady was in Michigan.
R:  -- that I've gotten in probably --
L:  She was just I think north of Flint or something.
R:  -- a good week and a half.  So --
L:  So, yeah.
R:  -- could be.  Maybe they are doing different things with it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  I don't know.  Uh-huh.  It'd be interesting.
L:  I wonder if we'll ever find out the results of it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, see it in the news or something.
R:  Have you done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have you done five of 'em?
L:  Yeah.  But I think this is my last call.
R:  You did three?
L:  So, I'm gonna be done.  I keep telling my husband to do it.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I -- I almost think there was an option on there where you could do five.
L:  No.  I've only done three.
R:  But I'm not --
L:  Are we -- do we get to do five?
R:  -- I'm not positive.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh.  I don't remember either.
R:  Huh.
L:  But when my -- when the phone rang my husband's like oh, you gotta tell 'em my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oldest daughter --
R:  It's pretty easy.  So ...
L:  -- 'cause she was calling one -- to earn some extra money somehow and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he was like well, we should tell her to do this.
R:  [NOISE] Talking on the phone's easy.  [LAUGH]
L:  It is very easy and kinda interesting.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  It's very easy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You're working.  There you go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's really died down quite a bit.
L:  So, I don't really know what the -- the -- you know, the major current event is, probably the war related stuff and ...
R:  Yep.  Yep.  Even here in Jackson I don't even know what the current events would be.  [LAUGH]
L:  It has died down.  I think everybody's getting really tired of it, you know?  So, I mean, not that I ...  Yeah.
R:  Really nothing.
L:  I was trying to -- I was going online earlier today trying to find --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- out where our local fireworks were --
R:  And I know a lotta stuff going on ...
L:  -- and I couldn't find it at all.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh [several inaudible words] --
L:  It seemed like right about now that they'd be putting that information out for people, but ...
R:  And -- and I don't know why because the fourth of July's on the Friday.
L:  Oh, it is?  On the third?  Not on the fourth, huh?
R:  Unless they think a lotta people are gonna be taking off and going outta town.  Yeah.  Because you'd head out --
L:  Yeah.  That's odd.
R:  -- that long weekend.
L:  I wonder why.
R:  It's just I think a lotta people are leaving and taking off outta town.
L:  Oh, that could be and so they don't wanna not have a big turnout.
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  Yep.  And it's supposed to be nice.  So ...
L:  Yep.  Yeah.  I'm glad it's on a Friday this year.  That's gonna be nice to have off work.
R:  Oh, really?  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  It is.  Well, it -- it said that it --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- might rain on Friday.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it usually comes from your way to us.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep.
L:  And then some scattered thunderstorms possible --
R:  Oh, boy!
L:  -- is all they're saying now, but I hope it doesn't amount to much.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It'd be nice.  Does it?  You probably won't get it then 'til maybe Sunday or Monday.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] My dog is barking.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hmm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yep.  Five, four and two.  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  We have a German Shepherd and he loves to talk.  Oh, boy.
R:  What's that?
L:  So, you've got three little kids, huh?
R:  She just finished this year.  Yep.  She'll go into first ...
L:  Oh, man, you're a busy lady.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, uh, is your five year old --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- in kindergarten yet?
R:  Yep.
L:  Is your five year old in kindergarten?
R:  Oh, that's a good age.  [LAUGH]
L:  Is she?  Oh, wow!  So, only one in school?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right. 
L:  I have a granddaughter who's gonna be in first grade.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can imagine.  I have all that to look forward to.
L:  But my youngest kids are fifteen now.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's -- it's a fun age.
R:  Yep.
L:  Although they're kinda --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- getting pretty independent and sometimes I miss them, but ...
R:  Yeah.  We just finished up tee ball.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep.  Our first year of tee ball and we just finished --
L:  Yes.  You do.
R:  -- up [inaudible].
L:  That's such a fun age though when they're little and ...
R:  So, we're kinda open for the summer and then we've got --
L:  Busy though.
R:  -- soccer starting --
L:  Really busy.
R:  -- in the fall.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's tiring, but fun.
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, did you?  My boys played tee ball.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They loved it.
R:  They are.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]  Just like your tee ball.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  They must be kinda cute out there --
R:  Tee balls the same way.
L:  -- kicking a ball around.
R:  They just kinda ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Everybody's hounding them do different things --
L:  But, yeah, they hardly know what to do.
R:  -- and they don't know which way to go.  [LAUGH]
L:  I can remember yelling at my kids run, run.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  And they'd get out on base and wave at ya, you know?
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  It was so cute.  [LAUGH]
R:  But she enjoyed it and then my four year old and the five year old can both play soccer.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That'll be good.
L:  I know sometimes they get confused and --
R:  They'll enjoy that together.
L:  -- do -- you know, they go the opposite way or ...  [LAUGH]
R:  They play pretty good together.  So ... 
L:  You're like no.
R:  No.  'Cause he's like December -- December third.  Yep.  So, misses that cut off point.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  That's good.
R:  Yep.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yep.  I'm all set.
L:  Is your four year old gonna be old enough for kindergarten then or no?
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, yep.
R:  Uh, I agree.  Yep.  That is true.
L:  So, you'll have him home another year.  That's kinda nice 'cause then he'll be a solid five, almost six when he starts.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, that'll -- that'll probably be good.  I don't think you do your kids any favors if ya start 'em too early.  So ...  Although we have a neighbor who's from Britain and they started -- they start kindergarten when they're three.  So, he's -- yeah, he came over here and he was oh, let's see --
