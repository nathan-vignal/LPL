R:  Hi.  My name is Erica.
L:  Hi.  I'm Cindy.
R:  Hi.  Where do you call from?
L:  Detroit, Michigan.
R:  Oh, I am in New York City.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, how do you [LAUGH] get your [LAUGH] news?
L:  How did I get picked for this?
R:  I think that's the topic; how do you find out about the news?
L:  It just comes on the recording.  They pick it at random.
R:  No, I mean the news.
L:  Oh, how do I get the news?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I r- -- I read the local paper --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and once in a while I watch the news.
R:  Well, then you are more better than most of us because [LAUGH] most of us get it from TV.  I used to get the New York Times but if you try to read it your entire evening goes by.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] you know, you either read the news or you do something else.  So, unfortunately, a lot of the time, yes, I get everything from the TV and some from the radio.  Yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Very seldom do I read the news anymore because you have to spend so much time on it.
L:  My time is five in the morning.  That's when our local news comes on here and that's when all of my kids are asleep.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have one daughter but I baby sit two boys.
R:  Oh.  That is --
L:  So, that's my only --
R:  -- even harder. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's my only, ah, free time is from five to six thirty in the morning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's when I read the day old newspaper, I r- -- have the TV on, I'll catch up on the news -- the headlines and that.  But I really don't keep up too much with current events.  You know, the local things.
R:  What bothers me is that, ah, they tell you a couple of minutes and then commercials and something else, commercials.  You know that a lot more is going on.
L:  Yes.
R:  You should be, ah, r- -- using the newspaper but there is no time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I remember when I cancelled the Times, I told them, "You know, I just don't have the time to read it.  I just keep throwing the paper out".  And they told me, "That's what everybody tells us".
L:  Mhm.
R:  They go into so many details. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  It would be great if you had the time but who does?
L:  I think it's not so much the news that's in the newspaper; it's too many ads.
R:  That's true, yes.
L:  There's a lot of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ads.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then --
R:  But what about the TV commercials?  That -- that drives me nuts.
L:  Yes.
R:  I am so happy for the remote. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, do you have cable?
R:  No, I do not. [LAUGH]
L:  Me neither.
R:  I do not.
L:  That's even --
R:  Beca- --
L:  -- worse than regular TV I feel.
R:  Is it?  Why?
L:  Because there's too much reality shows on TV --
R:  More than --
L:  -- and I don't --
R:  -- on regular?
L:  Yes.  And I don't like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And having a little one, I want her to know what's going on in the world, you know, or finding out educational things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we have public service here, which I do watch their news to find out what's going on in the world, the international news --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that but, um ...
R:  These reality shows drive me nuts.  And I w- -- I watched a couple just to find out what it's all about --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, you know, this is gonna be it from now on.
L:  I guess so.
R:  They cannot come up with new things.  And the news is usually so depressing that you want [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to read it day in day out.  It's terrible.  Local on the Iraq war has been going on -- you thought it was over.  Look what's going on over there.
L:  Ri- -- I know.  That's the sad thing.
R:  Yeah.  And a- -- it's -- I think it's going to es- -- it may escalate into something much bigger.
L:  I have a feeling too.  Um, [LIPSMACK] my daughter's part Arabic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and her p- -- ah, grandparents have the Arabic news channel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- come to their home and I will sit there and watch it with them and that and it's, like -- it's so different from our news.
R:  Really?
L:  It is completely different.  Um --
R:  How so?
L:  They show the blood and gore.
R:  Oh, god.
L:  They'll show the people that are hurt and they'll show the explosions and the damage, where our news, kinda, glorifies it -- it only shows you what our government wants to sh- --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- show us.
R:  But their governments want to see that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  How horrible --
L:  But I guess it --
R:  -- we must be -- Americans [NOISE] must be but to inflict upon them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, you never know the new- -- ah, the real truth because everybody is -- you get the -- all the information biased.
L:  Right.
R:  You read different newspapers and you get the exact opposite.
L:  Yeah.  Or else, if you talk to people to find out what's going on.
R:  How would they know any better [LAUGH] than us [LAUGH] --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- what's going on in Iraq? [LAUGH] How they know about it?
L:  Yeah.  That is true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But even for our local news, you know, if the children are in trouble or, you know, there's been r- -- some robberies or something, you really have to depend on your neighbors and your friends to let you know what's going on in the neighborhood. [PAUSE]
R:  Well, if it's in the immediate neighborhood, otherwise, how would they know?
L:  True.  But so much goes on that ...  Here in Detroit, our local coverage is not really local, it's very segregated.  It goes to the affluent sections of the suburbs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they don't give an all around scope of what's going on in Michigan.
R:  Hm.
L:  And it's pretty sad because they consider us, you know ...  I don't know.  We're a forgotten area.  Detroit is very much forgotten unless it's, you know, a big, major crime or a big drug bust or something to do with the Ambassador Bridge going over to Canada.  But they really don't promote any of, ah, Detroit or Flint.  It's always the affluent areas, affluent cities and then -- and even so, that's why I don't even watch our local news too much anymore.  And I've complained to 'em [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- why don't they -- "If it's local, why don't you put for all the different surrounding communities?"
R:  Well, what I think of the local news is they go into petty details -- a fire here or, you know, something really insignificant.  What's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to watch about the fire?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  And --
L:  Now, how is your local news?  Is it just for your borough or, um ... they have boroughs out there in New York don't they?
R:  Yes, five boroughs.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, mainly the five boroughs, yes.
L:  Now, do they give pretty well coverage on each one of what's going on?
R:  Well, if an event something happens.
L:  Only if something happens?
R:  If something happens.  You know, and you don't know if they tell you everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do you know?
L:  Now, do you get a local newspaper?
R:  If I do -- yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, the New York Times.  You know, that's if -- if I get the, ah, newspaper that's the New York Times.  Sometimes the Daily News.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But the Daily News will go more into, like -- like, you know, like, traffic problems and such and then the --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the murders and the t- -- fire.  And, ah, [SIGH] I mean, [SIGH] okay, you have to know what's going but who has [LAUGH] the time, again?
L:  Right.
R:  Even though I am not working right now I still don't have the time to sit down and read everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think they are covering insignificant things just because they don't know what else to put on.
L:  True.
R:  And s- -- and so ma- -- hours and hours, they start -- like, one of the stations starts at four thirty in the evening --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and it goes on until six or seven -- ah, maybe seven --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then again at ten o'clock or eleven o'clock.
L:  Yes. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.  We have a local paper here that only comes out on Wednesdays.
R:  Really?
L:  And it just tells what's going on in my city.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What activities are going on, who has died, who's been born, marriages.  It's very localized --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I like it.
R:  But -- mm.
L:  Though it costs five dollars a month to get that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It only comes out one day a week on Wednesdays.  So, I find out what's going on in my immediate community through that newspaper.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And very seldom will it touch on any of the national subjects or anything that's outside of our area, which, kind of, makes it nice.
R:  That sounds like something you want to know.
L:  Yes.
R:  But when I turn on the TV at eleven thirty AM and they tell you about fires here and then the robberies and so on, ah, so what?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unfortunately, it's the way it's -- we are used to it.  You know, it's -- goes on all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  And sometimes, if I can't sleep at night they start, like, three o'clock in the morning. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's three o'clock. [LAUGH] So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] half the day they are [LAUGH] having n- news on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, we get another broadcast at two in the morning here for our local news.
R:  Then you too are [LAUGH] covered at --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of the clock. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Now, if I miss --
R:  Two o'clock in the morning?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  If I miss the ten o'clock or eleven o'clock news then usually I'll stay up to watch that one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause it's, like, I just wanna know what's going on.  And the coverage that they gave us for the Iraq war, I think it was too much.  People got --
R:  Oh, it was on e- --
L:  -- bored of it.
R:  -- especially the first day at, ah, the clock.  Yes.
L:  Now, that was fine because that was something very major but then, if you really stop and think about it, the American public is very apathetic.  Look how many people put flags on their cars and their homes --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- when it first happened and now look -- there's nothing.  There's absolutely nothing.  There --
R:  Now, here, I do see the flags in apartment buildings, at the entrance --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot more than, ah -- than before.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  I still see it.  After all, we were hit.  Remember [LAUGH] that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you can, practically, expect it any time beca- -- they keep telling you, "It's gonna come again".
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I do believe it.
R:  Well, I'm sure they are not lying [LAUGH] about this.
L:  No.
R:  Yes.
L:  No.  They just don't know when it's gonna happen though.
R:  And what is -- what's gonna happen?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because if it's gonna be something, like, biological then all of us are gonna hurt and suffer.
L:  Right. [PAUSE] And, yeah, that's against their religion -- that's the sad thing.  It really is.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know, because of 'em are Muslim --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and they believe in peace and to help one another and everything and it w- --
R:  But they must feel by doing it they help one another.  That's w- -- [LAUGH] what they do to --
L:  To an extent they do.  Um, we're -- I'm not too far from a --
