R:  [inaudible] cool.
L:  -- neat place to live.  Ah, what -- what do you do for fun?
R:  Let's see, watch TV, let -- make music or listen to music.  I try to -- on the -- l- I- -- need to more -- do more reading and stuff.
L:  Um, what do you like to read?
R:  Um, mostly horror -- horror books.  I always liked that.  I don't like more ro- -- romance novels.
L:  Romance novels?
R:  I don't like those.  No.  I like just mis- --
L:  Oh, you don't like romance [LAUGH] novels?
R:  I used to like those things like the spread[?] novels and things like that.
L:  Okay.  Do you like to read, um, [LIPSMACK] oh ... what's the guy that is, ah --writes the awful ... s- -- ah, S- Steven King -- do you read any of those?
R:  Sure do.  Like, the -- read all of them.  Steven King and Steven Spielberg.
L:  He's -- he's, kinda, gruesome.  I don't know that I, you know --
R:  Well, I like that, kinda, things. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't.  Um, they keep me up at night.  Um, I love to read too but I want something that is calming at night so I don't read anything suspenseful.  Um, I even read children's books at night --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because they're -- they're more calming.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and how long do you -- how long do you spend doing your hobbies?
R:  Um, pro- I'd say about at least five hours a day.
L:  Five hours a day?
R:  Yeah.  I'm s- --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm -- I'm home all the time so the -- how -- the -- this [inaudible] my time.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] No- --
L:  Well, that's -- that's good.
R:  Yeah.  It gives me something to do with myself.  Don't go crazy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Time -- what -- time with a m- me and my son stop right now are watching the clouds in the sky when it -- when [several inaudible words] else they do.
L:  You -- you really do?  You watch the clouds?
R:  W- w- well, yeah, we still -- yeah.
L:  Oh, w- --
R:  Myself and my son.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Then he said, "Well, we've seen his clouds".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think [several inaudible words].
L:  Um, and a- -- and how old's your son?
R:  He's eight years old.
L:  Eight?  Oh. [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Um, at night I like to, um, watch the stars i- -- lie out on a blanket.  Have you ever done that with him?
R:  Yes, I have. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's neat.  I -- I love star watching.  So -- okay.  So, um, you read -- that's a hobby -- and a- -- okay, and you like to watch things with your son --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- do things with your son.  What else do you do for hobbies?
R:  He just make music.  My son makes me CDs on my computer.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  On your computer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- listen to music.  What kind of music?
R:  It makes m- -- I make CDs on my computer, like, burning CDs on my computer.
L:  You make CDs?
R:  Yeah.  Used to anyway.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, before they said you couldn't do it off your computer anymore?
R:  W- -- that's right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I just heard about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  We had to stop doing that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or f- -- I lose the computer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  The -- the --
R:  Well, I -- I chat on the chat line on computer for a hobby.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  But, um, the --
L:  Ah, yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I do that a little but, um, I find that it's, kinda, boring.  I'd rather talk to somebody, like you.
R:  Okay.  Huh.
L:  You know, because it's -- I guess it's faster, it's -- 'cause I -- I'm not a very fast --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- typist, um, you know, on a computer.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] well, then they asked us -- okay, so we have -- you have your hobbies and I have mine.  I don't spend a lotta time because I'm trying -- I'm not h- -- working right now out of the home but I guess I feel a little bit guilty.  I know people are supposed to have hobbies but I always feel a little guilty because I think there's other things to do.
R:  Ho- -- you know, a hobby is, like, you listening to music.  Do you like music?
L:  Yeah, I do and I -- and I, um -- well, I have the music on, like, when I'm doing housework or, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm doing my exercises ... I try to have it on but to just sit there -- I have a hard time just sitting unless I'm reading.
R:  Okay.  Too ha- --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Like, a actions person? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, [LAUGH] -- and -- and I -- yeah, that's hard.  That's hard.  But, um -- [LIPSMACK] oh, and then they asked how, um ... the -- if people should have at least one hobby -- they should, shouldn't they?
R:  I do -- I will agree with that.  It's -- they have a [several inaudible words].
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's [several inaudible words] hobby going on. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, yeah, I believe that's a bo- bo- -- everybody should have a -- some, kinda, hobby.
L:  Um, I feel for, I guess, men.  I don't think a lot of men have as many hobbies as women.  Do you think?
R:  I do.  No, I believe that -- I don't think so either, if they have any at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they have any at all.
L:  Uh-huh.  Um, well, and I think the sad thing is, like, when people stop -- if they work their whole lives and they haven't had hobbies and then they either retire or -- or -- I don't know, somehow disabled or, you know, lose their job, they don't know what to do with themselves.
R:  I know.  They're very frustrated after that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And sitting around a household they get very frustrated.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's probably they need a j- -- a hobby.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Relieve -- relieve some of the tr- -- and the stress.
L:  Yeah.  I- it does really, um, get rid of stress.  Yeah, you're right.  Um, I used to play the piano a lot, um, and I've just started doing that and I know that helps with stress.  You can either pound [LAUGH] a piano or just [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, just play for enjoyment.  Um, but I know some retired men who've lost their wives and they're -- they don't live very long.  They don't ha- have an interest in life.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Th- they give up on life.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's what it is.
L:  I- -- yeah.  I think so.  Um, [LIPSMACK] are you -- were you working outside of the home recently?
R:  Um, no.  My b- -- I'm disabled.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mostly I'm homebound. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  And are you married?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Um, and does your wife work outside the home?
R:  No -- yes, he do.
L:  So, you're -- you're home by yourself with your son?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, you know, that's, kinda, neat.  I mean, it's not neat that you're home -- d- disabled but that you're home and -- and you're able to do things with your son.  So many men miss out on that.
R:  I know.  So many.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  And you --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- sound like you have a really good attitude about life.
R:  Yeah.  Very [inaudible] attitude.
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And d- -- do you do -- excuse me, do you do things in, um, Washington?  Ah, do you, you know, go out and -- and see sights and things?
R:  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Mo- mostly [several inaudible words] out of the areas in sightseeing things like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause I've seen everything in DC that there is to see.  I've been here all my life.
L:  Y- you have lived there your whole life?
R:  Mhm.  Live here all my life.
L:  Oh.  I would love to see Washington DC.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  It's a nice place to be.
L:  Have you visited, um, you know, the capitol?  Have you done -- have you visited all of the --
R:  I did all --
L:  -- tourist attractions?
R:  -- all of 'em -- all of them. [LAUGH] I done all of them.
L:  Oh.  That -- that's terrific.  Some people live in places they've never done that.
R:  I know.
L:  Oh, that's a hobby in itself just to see the places, you know, of -- of historical interest. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  And have your, um -- has your son seen them too?
R:  Yeah.  We both go to together.  Me and myself and my hu- -- my s- -- me, myself, my husband and my, um, two stepsons --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my husband all do ho- -- like a hobby thing.  You know, they just wanted to see the -- the sightseeing -- the city.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  It's, kinda like, a hobby for all of us at one time. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, and -- and you learn so much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my husband is a history buff and he watches all the things on, um --
R:  So is mine.  He's doing it right now.
L:  Is --
R:  Yes, he is.  He's doing it right now.
L:  Oh. [LIPSMACK]
R:  He's watching Crusade[?] in [inaudible].
L:  Oh, how interesting. [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  And that is a hobby for him too. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  You bet.
R:  Yeah.  He --
L:  Well, it is pretty valuable to know -- to know th- -- some of those things. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Neat. [PAUSE]
R:  So, now -- what other hobby I have ...?  But that's -- that's it.
L:  Well, okay.  That sounds like a lot.  It sounds like you keep busy.
R:  I try to.
L:  Uh-huh.  Um, have you ever gotten -- have you ever, um -- do you have, like, a telescope to gaze at the stars?
R:  Ah, yeah, we're working on getting one now.
L:  Some of 'em are pretty expensive -- the better ones, aren't they?
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We're looking in a, um, catalogue and my husband looking at the catalogue of s- -- telescopes and mostly the prices are very ex- -- they get very expensive.
L:  Mhm.  Well -- so do you live on the outskirts of town or are you more inside in the --
R:  I'm in -- I'm dead -- dead in the center of c- -- DC.
L:  So, it's, kinda, hard, maybe, to see, um, stars with the city lights?
R:  No.  But anyway, I use [inaudible] DC -- you going to -- some place in DC is very clear to see the stars.
L:  Oh.
R:  I like to, you know, here -- top of our church or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's awful nice to see the stars clearly there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] we live in, kind of, a valley in town and sometimes we have to go to the outskirts in order to see some of the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, they'll say, um, [LIPSMACK] if you can see some star real bright, you know, they tell you ahead of time.  Um, but sometimes we have to go to the outskirts of town to see.  I think maybe because we get a lot of cloud cover.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, I'd -- I would love to get a telescope.  I think that would be neat.  Do you know any of the -- do you know the constellations?
R:  Some of them are familiar.  I forgot about [inaudible].  Yeah.  I forget the name of them.  Been so long, ah, doing type of thing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know -- I would like to learn some of them.  Um, do you know that you can -- there's a place you can write or you can call and you can, ah, name a star after somebody?
R:  Um, y- --
