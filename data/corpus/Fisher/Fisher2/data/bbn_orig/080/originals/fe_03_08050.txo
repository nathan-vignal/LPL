L:  Crystal.
R:  Veronica.
L:  Okay.  Uh, they said the topic is computer games?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Um, I like computer games and the main -- the main computer games I play is anything to do with, um, like gambling of anything that's like, uh -- like about, um, the Atlantic City games, uh, uh, like card games or -- or [NOISE] -- yeah, I like games like Spades to, um ...
R:  We used to play Euchre.
L:  Huh?
R:  Euchre.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's my kid.  I like, uh -- like the, um -- you know, like the ones you put -- you put like the quarters and stuff in and you -- when you go to -- the slot machines.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's what I like.
R:  Slots.
L:  Uh, and I -- I enjoy playing them on, uh -- the online game.
R:  Okay.
L:  I play those.  But I don't play it for money.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like playing, you know, for fun.
R:  I usually don't play those.  We -- I like to play Euchre or Tetras or -- what's the other ones I usually play?  I've played Tomb Raider before.  That one's not too bad and racing, car racing.
L:  Oh, okay.  They have those on, um -- do you play it online or you play the computer ...?
R:  You can play 'em online and they got it on C.D. too.
L:  Okay.  Now -- now, I know they're on C.D.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Though I didn't know they were online.
R:  Oh, yeah.  You can race against all these other people that have really supped up systems.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They usually win because they're so high performance on theirs.  But they're not too bad.  Midtown Madness, uh, Nascar.
L:  Now, my son he's into those, uh, the -- my older son he's into those, uh -- you know, like the -- the video games --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and he gets hooked and so I'm kinda -- I'm -- I'm kinda scared to get into those, but then I'm quick at getting 'em, you know, as soon as [LAUGH] I -- I see one ...
R:  It's easier to gamble and play, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  When I see these gamble and play, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm like well, if I play that enough, you know, maybe I'll get lucky in Atlantic City, you know? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Maybe my odds would be better when I get there, you know?  That's why I like playing it.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, now, I do get on there and play Bingo every now and then.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  They got Bingo on there and -- and you can win money on some sites and you don't have to put no money up for it.
L:  Now, I know there's a site that I -- that place, um, uh -- I think it's on, um -- is it Pogos or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I played on that site.  You know, you get so many -- you, uh, get so many coins or something like that and you get a chance to, uh, cash in or something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And I like those sites.  As long as it's -- it's something where I'm not risking anything, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  There's us- -- yeah, I don't play those risky ones.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that I'll play and even some of those gam- uh, gambling sites they have, those gaming sites where they give you the free, you know, money to play with it, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They -- they have those, you know, and I'll play with the free money, but then they have it, you know, where you can also gamble with real money --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I -- I don't that far.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-uh.  [LAUGH]  We played, uh --
L:  I'm scared my ...
R:  -- Family Feud on there too.  That's -- that's ...
L:  I've played that before.  I played the Family Feud, um, before.
R:  That's -- you gotta be real quick at that one.
L:  And then I also, um -- I've checked out -- they have those three D. -- but this has been like a year ago when I checked out this site.  Uh, I -- one time like when I first got my computer I was really trying to check out the different, uh, sites.  They had those slot machines that were like three D.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yep.
R:  Oh, that'd be neat.
L:  Those are -- yeah, those are fun.  I can't remember what the site -- the name of the site is now to save my life.
R:  I've always -- I've always been afraid to try those 'cause everybody says, you know, they're gonna charge ya, you know?
L:  Anything with, um -- or like any type of game where they have like -- like as far as slots go where they have the bonus, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the bonus, uh, round, like once you get a certain -- like if you get like -- let's say for instance you get three seven's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you get that and then you wind up getting on a bonus, uh, you know, game where you can -- you earn extra points, I enjoy that but, uh, it's just I don't wanna really risk my money.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't blame you there.
L:  I won't go that far.  But ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Also Spades I have played on, uh, I think it was Pogos too, where they have the Spades when you're playing with other people.
R:  Yeah.  I just recently checked out that site.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  I don't play too much on there.  They have like a bubble game or something.  I've tried that and, uh, I don't know what the other site is.  It's called Jewels or something like that.  You have to get 'em real fast.
L:  Oh, in order to get -- what, you get points for it?
R:  Yeah.  You get points.
L:  So many ...  There's a -- a thing -- I think it's I -- I Win I think.  That's -- that might be the one -- I think it's one that, um, you can earn points and stuff like that too.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I never had -- you know, I never -- well, I never tried to, um -- I never won anything.  Let's just put it like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I had got so many points, but I never -- you know, I -- there was some where, you know, you can put in certain points in order to get into some type of sweepstake.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Mhm.  And get to some type of ...
R:  I've won like two dollars playing Bingo, but you have to win so much before they actually cash in.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's the downside to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's exciting, you know, for a while, you know?  It's -- it's a little exciting and stuff.  Like, the Mortal Combat, that's a video game, I know you've played that before.
R:  Me?
L:  Yeah.  Mortal Combat.
R:  Uh, I don't think so.
L:  No?
R:  No.  We've got a lot of --
L:  You sort of --
R:  -- Star Wars.
L:  -- have you ever saw the -- the little -- the, uh, movie they had, um, Mortal Combat?
R:  No.  I don't -- I didn't see that.
L:  Okay.  Well, um, that's when you're -- it's -- it's like a, uh, fighting game.  It's like, uh -- you know, like karate and stuff like that --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- with the graphics and all that where ...  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  My kids might play that one.
L:  Yes.  Um, I've played that before.  [LAUGH]  That one was interesting, but then if you lose, you know what I'm saying, you're dead, you know, and ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  You know --
R:  There's another one ...
L:  -- it gets -- and it gets a little bit graphic.  [NOISE]  And that's --
R:  We got, uh --
L:  -- yeah, that's ...
R:  -- Red Neck Rampage.
L:  No.  I ain't never played that.
R:  Oh, that one --
L:  That's another one like that?
R:  -- boy, it tells you everything, but if you screw up it tells ya.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It cusses at ya and all that stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Like when it gets too graphic, I mean, I get a little -- I mean, that I get a little scared -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, like, uh, I'm not -- I'm not into that, but my -- you know, like my son he's all into that stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I just like something like regular -- like press the button and go through it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But like I said, um, playing Spades or, like you said, Bingo or something like that, something simple.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's just like that Tomb Raider trying to play that and, jeeze, that's ...
L:  Huh?
R:  Tomb Raider.  It's an older one.
L:  Tomb Raider.  Oh, yeah.  That's out on like that -- I see -- oh, yeah, I saw the movie.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've tried to play that one and that one it's kinda rough if you don't know what you're doing, you know?  We get to certain stages and we have to stop because we can't figure out how to get any further.
L:  Mm.  What, you get, um, blocked in like a maze or something like that?
R:  No.  You just can't go any -- you have to go through all kinds of things before you can go somewhere else and if you don't do it just right you don't have anything to go to the next stage and then you can't make it.
L:  So, you're stuck?
R:  My husband he's pretty good at that one though.
L:  I think like -- I like the games when they first came out, like with the Nintendo and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Give me Mario Brothers.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Give me something like that I'll play.  [LAUGH]  I'll play ...
R:  Or back when they had Atari, like Centipede --
L:  Yeah.  You know, give --
R:  -- and Frogger.
L:  -- yeah, Pac Man.  You know what I'm saying?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, those easy ones.  [LAUGH]
L:  The Pac Man or like those little simple -- simple games.  When you get into all that graphic stuff, man, forget it.  I can't ...
R:  You get confused.
L:  Yep.
R:  There's another one they have, but I can't re- remember the name of it.  But when you shoot, I mean, it sounds just like a real gun and it shows the bullet holes, graphics, and all kinds of stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's really bad.
L:  I think they had, um -- I mean, I know I saw -- I saw, um, one -- well, that was a -- that was at -- I think it was at a pizza parlor or something they had one of those games where, um, you're -- it's just like you're in a police, um -- I guess like a police person or whatever's chasing you --
R:  Army.  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, you're shooting and all this stuff and they have the -- yeah, it's like, um -- it's like you're part of a -- oh oh, what's it?
R:  Like a swat team or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Man, that would have my heart racing.  I can't [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, it was --
L:  -- I'd get ...
R:  -- it was very graphic.
L:  Yeah.  Because some of those things you can get -- you know, you're getting into some -- you know, it gets me excited.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't get into something like that.  Give me something simple.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Give me the regular Pac Man or -- or something, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- something common that I can just press the button 'cause I'm old fashioned in that -- in that way.
R:  Cool.
L:  I can't get into all that graphic stuff.
R:  And some of 'em you've gotta swim under water and you have to -- if you're under too far, you know, you lose all your breath and ...
L:  No.  I -- I can't -- I can't get with that.  I mean, it's bad enough to learn how to jump.  You know what I'm saying?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, for Lara Croft in that Tomb Raider, boy, you've gotta teach her how to swing and, I mean, she does everything if you get the darn thing to do it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, it's just like the movie, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where you have to go swinging and all that stuff like that and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- fighting and all that.
R:  Fighting all them animals.
L:  Nah.  I can't be doing all that kicking and back flipping and all that messing around.
R:  Yep.
L:  Mhm.  That's just like, um, Mortal Combat, what I'm talking about it 'cause the way they be, uh, pressing those buttons, going back and forth, and kicking and jumping up and all that stuff, fighting, I can't get into that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not -- uh-uh.
R:  They need to make 'em --
L:  Keep it simple.
R:  -- a little bit ...
L:  Huh?
R:  They need to make 'em a little bit more simpler.
L:  Exactly.  [NOISE]
R:  Some of the guys out there they're just -- that's all they do.  So, they can sit and figure that out, it's real easy, but ...
L:  But you get hooked on it also.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know what I'm saying?  [LAUGH]
R:  You do.
L:  It's quick to get hooked on it.
R:  I could sit there and watch my husband play and just start cringing and scooting back and forth, like oh, no.
L:  Yeah.  Like you're actually in -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like you're in it.  As I said, those action ones I -- I -- boy, your -- your adrenalin starts going.
R:  Shit, I get mad sometimes when I play Bingo.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  That's what I'm saying.  That's just like -- you know what I mean?  This is why gambling --
