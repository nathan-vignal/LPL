L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Patricia.
R:  Hi, I'm Diana.  How nice to meet you, or talk to you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, and do you play computer games?
R:  Um, I haven't played them recently.  I have played some, um, I -- I didn't play them online, I played just on the cd-rom.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Unreal Tournament was the one that I -- I usually played.  I'd occasionally play, ah, ah, what's it called, Solitaire --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  and a couple of those.  How about you?
L:  I do play computer games and I love them.  [LAUGH] I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- play simple ones.  I don't play bang, shoot 'em up ones, and in fact when I got the call I was playing Super Domino Dementia.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you're kidding.
L:  No, no, no.  I also like to play Super Mahjong and Cubey[?].
R:  Oh, I've played that.
L:  And I -- I got them from my Bell South, ah, dot net.  They give you a sample of the game --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so I played the sample and then I liked it and so I bought two of them.  They were, I think, twenty dollars, and, ah, so I -- I think they are, ah, fun.  I try to limit myself [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I am retired so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, I, ah, say, "Okay, I'm gonna mop the kitchen floor --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- and then I'll play, you know, for a while".
R:  It's easy to lose track of time when you're playing them, it --
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  -- really is.  You look up and it's like, "Okay, two hours has passed".
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  My, um -- I have a newborn, so I haven't been playing a whole lot of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of computer games lately, but my husband, he's really into it.  He plays them online.
L:  Right, he probably plays the action ones.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Right.
R:  He plays them online and there would be some nights where he'd play, you know, with his friends from work and they'd be up 'til two or three in the morning playing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, oh, isn't that funny?  No, I don't -- I don't -- I'm afraid to get that involved because I really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like reading.  I really like reading and I really like other things, but I do think -- I do think they're good for older people because I think it keeps, ah -- I think that retirement homes should have simple computer games --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because I think it would be good for them to have something, you know, to pass away forty five minutes.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.  I -- so, I think they're positive, but of course I play simple, more generic ones and of course I play Solitaire --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I -- I do play that.  I play that kind of competitively with the fellow I date, we just gotta take turns --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, seeing who -- who wins first.
R:  It's -- I -- I have a twenty one month old and I've been getting him into some and he's even starting on j- -- ah, there's a program out there, Reader Rabbit --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they have little computer games for the kids [LAUGH] and he's even starting.
L:  How nice.  Well, I -- I think it's positive, ah, if it's not done to excess, you --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- know, probably, because I think you have to have people to people contact, and I think you have to have other kinds of things.  But I think, um, I would prefer to say more positive than negative, but of course, like I said, I don't play --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- killer games, you know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and I -- I do know that there is some negative feeling about teens with that kind of game.
R:  That's true.  But this games are hard.  I think they're a good thing, I mean, I've -- I've seen some of the, you know, kids do things with those that I certainly couldn't do.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Well, without a lot of practice.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  But I definitely think they develop the hand eye coordination.
L:  Right.  Yeah, all of my children, course my children are old now, my children are all in their forties, but, um, ah, you know, they can do that click, click, click, click stuff and with -- with, ah, their nieces and nephews --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and -- and probably the nieces and nephews are better, so I do think, ah, it -- it takes -- I just think it's good because we are in a computer world and the game kind of is a fun way to get involved, you know, if it's -- if it's not too intense or too negative.
R:  I never thought of it that way, that's true though.  It is a good --
L:  Well, I always thought that was why Solitaire was on the, ah, computers, because men did not want to be typing but they would click and do Solitaire, and I always thought that was why Word came out, because, of course, I was more of a typist and I liked Wordperfect, but then when you did Word you had to stop and take your hand off the keyboard and click certain --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- things and I resented that, I thought, "Oh, this is just --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- for men because they don't want to type", but, and I think that's why, um, MacIntosh was so popular because you didn't type, you did most things clicking.
R:  And it's -- if you're -- if you're a good typist it's faster --
L:  Yeah, to just --
R:  -- to type as opposed to clicking.
L:  -- type.  Yeah.  Yeah, when I was working I typed over eighty, probably between eighty and a hundred words a minute always.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, so it was funny but -- but now I've gotten used to all of the Word things and all of the clicking and -- and so, but I always did think that was why Solitaire was put on there so you would learn to drag and learn to click and learn to point and it was a simple way, so I think in the beginning --
R:  And it's something that everybody knows how to play.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  So, I think that's why that's simp- --
R:  So, it's not intimidating.
L:  Uh-uh, uh-uh.  So, it -- it is, I think it's -- it's interesting.  Well, do you have a boy and a girl?
R:  I have two boys.
L:  Two boys.  I have two boys --
R:  Two boys.
L:  -- and one girl.  Yeah --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's good, that's good.  Well, they will definitely --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- be in the click, click, click.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes they will.
L:  So, [MN] --
R:  It's really going to be interesting, I think to -- to see --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, the generation that was raised with computers, you know, 'cause I really didn't -- I was in college before I really started to use one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, but my -- my son is twenty one months and, I mean, he's --
L:  And he --
R:  -- not great at it but he can, you know --
L:  Well, he's interested in it --
R:  -- do some of his, you know, simple little games.
L:  -- and it's en- entertaining to him, you know.
R:  You know, it's -- you know, popping the bubbles to find a picture and --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, just, like you said, very simple things, but it's enough to -- it's, you know, keeps him interested and it's teaching him to, you know, not -- to use the --
L:  Be intimidated by it, yeah.
R:  -- mouse and to start to use the keyboard and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff like that.
L:  Is it a keyboard game or a mouse game?
R:  You could actually use either --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- you can use the keyboard or the mouse for it, and I think they sell --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- um, I -- I've heard that they sell something that you could put over your keyboard so that only certain keys are exposed for them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I -- I haven't gotten one of those.
L:  Why would they do that?  Do they feel like too many keys are too -- too much, um, you know --
R:  No.
L:  -- stuff to absorb?
R:  I don't know, or maybe that they're too small, maybe, I don't know if they're bigger keys --
L:  Oh just so they hit the right key then.
R:  -- ah, I'm not -- I'm not really sure but I -- I did remember, I -- I've seen a couple of places, you know, that some games it would be compatible --
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  -- with that, you know, the -- the kids keyboard that they have.
L:  Right, right.  It sounds like your children are -- my -- my first two were fourteen and a half months apart.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  So, so, you're doing -- you're doing about my -- [LAUGH] a little bit less than mine -- better than mine, yeah.  But it's nice when they've grown up, it really is.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's what we thought, they'll be nice and close.
L:  Yes, yes, yes, mm, that's good.  Well, I -- I think that's, ah, clever that you have a, um, -- access -- a game for him and -- and that he is interested in it, yeah.
R:  You know, and he likes it.  He really, you know -- sometimes I don't even feel like playing and he's, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he's crying to play.
L:  Right.
R:  I've played that Mah Jong before, you know, I forgot about that.  I'll have to see -- I -- 'cause I used to -- I used to, um -- a friend of mine had that game and I remember playing it at her house.
L:  It's so simple in that --
R:  It's --
L:  -- it's a -- a matching and as your children get older, it's a game that would, I think, facilitate reading, because reading is often matching, you know, some of that pre reading stuff they do in kindergarten is look at the two pictures that are the same, and I think you can change it from the Mah Jong symbols that are the, um, original Mah Jong sym- symbols to, like, cats and dogs and things --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and -- and then you would be matching, you know, you would have a -- a -- a stack and you would have to look for the red cat and the red cat and the blue cat and the blue cat or something.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  I think so, I -- I --
R:  It would make sense though, I'm sure it would be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- easy enough for them to do really.
L:  Yeah, so, I'm -- I'm trying to think if I bought that.  I don't think -- yeah, I guess I did buy that.  I bought that and Super Domino Dementia, and then my son gave me Cubeys.
R:  I haven't played that, is that a good -- what- what's that game like?
L:  I did Cubeys.  Cubeys is, yeah, it's again, I -- they are -- they are really probably all hand eye coordination, although, like, Where In The World Was Car- -- you know, that one, I always wanted to play that one 'cause that had some, um, history and stuff in it, I -- I can't think of what the name of it was, it was a early one for like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of m- middle school kids and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it was Where In The World and it was kind of like clues of where they went and maybe --
