L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Vicky.
R:  Hi, Vicky, my name's Gwen.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm doing okay.
L:  Good.  Is this the first time you've done one of these calls or ...?
R:  No.  I think this is about my second one.
L:  Oh, mine too.
R:  And I was trying to get on the computer just, you know, to play a game.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I was having problems with the dial tone, trying to find out why I couldn't connect.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  So, do you play computer games at all?
R:  Uh, yeah.  I play a lotta -- I play a lotta -- I play Bingo, I play, uh, Yahtzee, all kinda games on here.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  But ...
L:  Do you play 'em actually on the Internet or through just CDROMs on your own computer?
R:  No.  I -- I play 'em -- some on the Internet and some just CDROM.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  Um, uh, well, I have, um, uh -- there is a few that I -- I have played online, like on Yahoo games and, um [LIPSMACK] -- our I.S.P. just switched to Com Cast and I guess they have one too.  I haven't really looked through it to see what kinda games they have yet, but -- and then I have just a few that I play, um, at home, not all that often though, but --
R:  Yeah.  Oh.
L:  -- there's one that I've found, there's a website where you can play.  I think it's called It's Your Turn Dot Com or something where you can -- not really like you're playing real time, but you can -- like, if you're Chess with somebody you can make 'em m- -- or Backgammon or something you can make 'em move and then it -- it emails the other person and says okay, you know, it's your turn to make a move and then when they've made a move you get an email back saying okay, now it's your turn to move.  So, that you don't have to play it all at once, you know?  You can play it over time.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, but I just signed up for that.  So, I don't quite know how it's going yet.  [LAUGH]  I'll have to ...
R:  Well, I -- like I said, I play a lotta Bingo and Yahtzee -- and I play that too with my granddaughter and Pac Man --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- on C.D. Rom.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  How long have you, um, been going online for stuff?
R:  Oh -- oh, a lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  A -- a long time?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah, a long time.
L:  So, did you -- how old is your granddaughter?
R:  My granddaughter she's eight.
L:  Oh.
R:  She's good at it.
L:  What -- what does she like to play?
R:  Uh, she likes to play Yahtzee, she likes to play -- now she's into Solitaire.  She likes to --
L:  Oh, my parents like Solitaire a lot.
R:  -- she wants to take time playing Solitaire and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she likes to keep scores.  She's very competitive.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Where do you play -- where -- like, do you go to Yahoo or what sites do you go to to play?
R:  Well, actually I play Bingo on a site, uh -- it's, uh, a bingo site that I go to and sometimes I play for cash and sometimes I don't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- uh, and then I play, uh -- everything else I play off of the C.D. Rom except for the, uh, Solitaire.  We play that off of the regular screen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, is -- so is Yahtzee -- do you play that one online or from a C.D. ...?
R:  No.  No.  That's a C.- uh, that's, uh, a C.D. -- CDROM.
L:  Oh, okay.  I was gonna say 'cause it sounds like that would be fun, but I haven't seen that one on any site yet, but ...
R:  Yeah.  They have different kinds.  They have -- they have, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- color -- different -- I mean, there's just -- it's -- they have the regular Yahtzee, but then they have some links to different games.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Oh, well, that's cool.
R:  I'm guessing my granddaughter -- she likes to keep scores, see who wins the most games.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  Yeah.  And I know Solitaire -- different -- depending on what comes with your computer or sometimes what you can find online.  They have a bunch of different, you know, versions.
R:  Yeah.  I never went online looking for any.  I had a C.D. Rom with some different ones on it.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I -- I haven't played that in a long time.  It's just, uh, my computer went out and I borrowed my friend's one.  I didn't even have games on mine.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I don't know w- what I didn't have games on mine, but I didn't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and since I borrowed my friend's -- Brian -- he had it on his and, uh, so we were -- she's been playing a lot of it.
L:  Mhm.  Well, that's good.
R:  And she goes to Yahoo dot com games and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and Nickelodeon and all of them but, uh, I mean, like I said, I basically more or less play Yahtzee or Bingo.
L:  Yeah.  I have thought about going to Nickelodeon.  I bet they would have some cool stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they do for kids I think.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's cool.  Well, yeah, the Yahoo one -- like, I found some games that -- you know, some of 'em you can play online and some of 'em you have to like download and you get, you know -- you can play like thirty times before you have to -- to decide if you wanna keep it or not.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I've never ...
L:  So, but I like the ones that you can just go in and play online.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I've never bought a game off --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- off of there.  My brother and them play Dominos all the time with other people.
L:  Oh, that'd be cool.
R:  So, yeah.  They like that --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- and it's like you -- they keep points and stuff and my sister in law is kicking his butt.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they -- they brag about that all the time, but I've never tried it.
L:  That's cool.
R:  I never did like Dominos.  So, I don't play --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on that site, but they're always telling me how they play Dominos and she's always telling me how they -- they were tearing him up and she had to go in and -- and, uh, take over for him.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow!  [LAUGH]  I have a, uh -- I'm not sure if I have the copy of it or if my brother does -- but, um, I know when I first started getting on, you know, the computer and getting on -- online -- I don't know -- like, four or five years ago, um, we got a copy -- a C.D. copy of Risk.  You know the game Risk?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  I've never played it, but I know it's a game. 
L:  Yeah.  We -- we got a C.D. version of it.  I was -- he lives in another city, but I was visiting him and we got the C.D. version of it and we would play each other just on the one computer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then I've heard since then that like if he -- if he and I got the same ver- -- like, if we got one now because obviously there's been newer versions since then -- if we each got the same version we could play each other --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- online.  So --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- you know, I keep forgetting to, you know, make sure that he goes out and gets the same one and I would get it too and then we could actually play each other online 'cause that would be kinda fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I live in Seattle.
R:  Okay.  I'm from Louisiana.
L:  Oh, cool.  Are you getting hit with the big storms that are going on right now?
R:  Um, actually we haven't had any bad weather or anything.  We get rain here every day, but I was looking at the newspaper, front page, they -- they were talking about the storm here -- you know, in the Gulf.  But, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really we're not getting any effects from it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Not -- not -- not yet.
L:  Are -- so are you in a different part of the state?  I mean, you're -- are you more north or ...?
R:  No.  No.  Not really.  I mean, they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they saying they're brewing up in the Gulf but, uh, we really haven't gotten anything from it yet.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  I live right -- I live close to Lake Charles.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh, I don't know if you know where that is.  It's close to the Texas line.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm about -- about an hour from the Texas line.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  And sometimes it heard to tell, you know, they'll -- on the news a lotta times they make -- I mean, I'm sure it's -- I'm sure it's bad.  It sounded like New Orleans was getting hit really bad.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, you know, a lotta times on the news they ...
R:  I hope not.  I'm going to [inaudible] tomorrow.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  They -- they exaggerate stuff sometimes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I mean, I've been hearing all kinds of stuff about this storm, but we haven't -- we aren't getting any effects from it yet.
L:  Oh, well, that's good.  Hopefully you won't.
R:  I hope we don't either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It doesn't sound like it's very --
R:  I hate bad weather.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- much fun.  Yeah.  No kidding.
R:  And we've had some bad ones come through, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we haven't had any really, you know, no bad problems ourselves, but we've seen 'em get close.
L:  Yeah.  I can imagine.
R:  We go out and spend hundreds of dollars preparing for 'em.  I mean, we're in the sunshine here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yep.
R:  The first time we don't get prepared it'll -- it'll hit us.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Isn't that always the way it is?  So, do you have, um -- does your granddaughter that you mentioned live near you or ...?
R:  Well, she stays with me most of the time.
L:  Oh, she does?
R:  She lives --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- she lives only a couple of blocks from me.
L:  Oh.
R:  But she tries to stay here all the time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, she's -- would she be in like second grade then?
R:  Yeah.  She's going into third.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  She's better on the computer than I am.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  I -- yeah, I bet it must be, um -- it must be interesting to -- you know, 'cause I'm sure kids start with computers now all the way from the beginning all the way through.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  You know?  So ...
R:  She's -- she's kinda pretty intelligent.  She's made straight A.'s since she's been in school.
L:  Well, that's ...
R:  She hasn't made a B. yet.
L:  Oh, well, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, she's --
L:  That's ...
R:  -- really smart and she -- she stays on the computer.  She's always looking for something and trying to learn something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I kinda like yield to her and let her have it as much as she wants to.
L:  Mhm.  Well, that's good.
R:  I usually -- I'm usually on it late at night.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like right now, like I said, I was trying to get on there -- when the phone rung I was trying to, uh, get on the Internet and kill time.  It wouldn't -- just -- I was disconnected.
L:  Oh.  Huh.
R:  No dial tone. 
L:  Do -- you have -- do you have dial up?
R:  But I had a dial tone 'cause my phone wouldn't ring [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I -- I have only have one line.  So ...
L:  So, do you have dial up access then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not D.S.L. or anything?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's cool.  Yeah.  It's -- I -- I'd like to get online to play games more often than do.  I usually end up kinda surfing through websites and stuff.  But, you know, every once in a while I'll pass a site and see games and go oh, yeah [LAUGH] --
R:  Try it out, huh, check it out.  Yeah.
L:  -- need to go look and see what new games are out there.
R:  But the thing is if I get stuck on a game I'll play all night.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's the dangerous part.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I -- yeah, once I start playing games that's it, it just takes so much -- so much time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I'll get -- stay on there all night playing them.  I've -- I've played all night to where there's daylight when I got off the computer.
L:  Oh, really?
