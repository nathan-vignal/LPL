R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Jo- -- hi, I'm John.
R:  Hi, I'm Renee.
L:  Um, let's see.  It depends on the movie, in terms of, um, seeing it in a movie theater versus watching at -- a- at home.  It -- you know, it depends if it has, like, a lot of special effects and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatnot.  Um, does that --
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  Yeah, and I might prefer, you know, something a bit more -- like the more action oriented, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in a movie theater --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- th- than a kind of, you know, a comedy drama whatever in, um, at home.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  But I feel like there's some movies that you definitely have to see in a movie theater, and then there's some that are kind of a waste of money and time if you go to a movie theater --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you could just watch 'em at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, there is --
L:  And some of it depends on the quality of the movie overall.
R:  Mhm.  Have you seen, uh, like a good movie that you -- that you really enjoyed in the movie theater?
L:  Um, it's -- i- it's actually been a f- -- number o- -- uh, the last movie I actually saw was X Men, so it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- been a while since I've, uh, actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- been i- -- been in -- in a theater.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, I -- I mean, I -- I really enjoyed that.  I -- I gotta catch up, um, on my movie watching though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And yourself?
R:  Um, uh, the last I saw was, uh, Too Fast Too Serious and I felt like that could have be- -- it could have been seen at home, but it was -- it was fun, 'cause it was with a bunch of friends so [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, who was in that?
R:  Um, I -- I don't know.  I don't really follow that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but it was -- it was a good movie.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was all about cars, racing cars.
L:  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  Uh --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- um, do -- w- when you're at home, do you, um, have videotapes or do you r- rent DVDs or --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, like, right now we're watching a movie, and it's on my other laptop with a DVD player, so --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- so we're watching it on that and, um, sometimes I'll -- I -- I don't rent movies too often, I -- I like to borrow movies and I haven't watched too many DVDs, but I do like the quality of DVDs though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  I agree.  I, uh, I joined Net Flix and that's a -- it's pretty good program for --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- for the, uh, you know, for the value and all that, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, you know, the -- [MN] like -- like I said before, there are some movies that you just need to watch in a -- on a large screen and actually --
R:  Right.
L:  -- actually X Men, I'm glad I -- you know, the -- the second X Men, I'm -- I'm glad I actually saw, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a -- in a big theater, it was a -- it was a good, high action type of movie and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, uh --
R:  Mhm.  And then you -- you know what plays into this too is the quality of the movie theater.
L:  Right, absolutely.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R: Yeah.
L:  W- -- um, what -- what type of -- what movie theater is near you in terms of --
R:  Um, well, I'm in the city, so -- New York city --
L:  Oh, so am I.
R:  -- so I can -- a- are you?
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm in, uh, Brooklyn actually and that --
R:  Okay, yeah, I'm on Staten Island. [LAUGH]
L:  Cool, cool.
R:  Wow, yeah, so I've been to a few in Times Square and that's really nice.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh --
R:  Uh-huh.  Ah, mhm?
L:  There's a, uh, uh, theater called the Pavilion in, uh, [inaudible] Brooklyn --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, which is nice, so I'll -- I'll sometimes go there.  But, um, you know, once in a while we'll go into the -- into the city for a film, but usually it's more the alternative films that don't appear --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on, uh, on regular, uh, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the regular circuit, so --
R:  Yeah, I can watch those on DVD because then I can watch the director's, um, comments.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I really like to listen to that, like the, um, the independent films --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I like to know what they were thinking when they made it, what points they wanted to make and what was --
L:  But, oh, I -- I --
R:  -- going on in their head.
L:  -- I agree, yeah, the -- the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- p- -- some of them are really interesting and --
R:  Yeah, it's a really -- it's a big plus, and then sometimes they give, like, the, um, camera shots and mess ups and things like that.  I think you can get a lot from a DVD that you don't really get from other movies.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, they're -- i- --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, yeah, I think it takes a while sometimes to get, um, I mean, it's starting t- to broaden, the -- the DVD --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- collection, but there's still, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- i- i- -- I guess more and more demand has to be created to get as, you know, as much, uh, films out there as -- as possible, for --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in terms of selection.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.
L:  But --
R:  That's very true.  But it's -- I think everyone's converting, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Like we went to the store the other day and you can buy TV -- the newer TVs have a VCR and a DVD player --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so --
L:  Right.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's good to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have e- either option, depending on the -- on the movie and all that, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, w- what other movies have you seen that you recommend?
R:  Um, we just -- we just watched Traffic on DVD today --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that was nice, 'cause it's kind of a hard movie to follow, but we listened to the -- the, um, the special scenes and they kind of told about whether and why they made the movie and how it's going and things like that, so that was interesting, and -- [MN] hm, ah, when I went and saw -- I remember, I will never forget this experience, it was last summer, but extremely hot day and we got caught in Four- -- um, in Fourteen Street --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that was when all the electricity went out down there.
L:  Went out, yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.
R:  And we were caught, we couldn't get back.  We -- we planned on seeing a play that day and it -- it didn't run and everyone was trying to get taxis, the buses were full, the subways were down, there was no way out of the lower Manhattan.
L:  Right, right.
R:  We finally got out somehow on the subway, we made it up to Times Square and we went in and we saw the movie with, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, now I'm going to forget, but it's with, um, Tom Cruise and the mind, the different minds. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, as a -- oh, yeah.  Um, m- m- -- uh, I'm forgetting the name but I -- I think I know what movie you're talking about.
R:  Yeah, where they have the people in the water and some of them, they can --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they can tell if someone's going to make a -- do a crime.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah, and I saw that, um, in Times Square and I've never gotten so pulled into a movie, like, it's like nothing was happening outside, I was so totally into that movie. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- it was a long movie, but I enjoyed every second of it.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, th- tho- those act- -- those non stop movies are -- are really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, fun to -- to go to and all that.
R:  Yeah, I watched it again on video and I just -- I didn't have the same feeling.  It was just like watching any other movie, but that was --
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  -- it was just nice.  I mean, it was hot outside when we went in the movie theater --
L:  Mhm, nice and --
R:  -- and we had soda and everything and it's the ex- --
L:  Right, nice and air conditioned and all that?
R:  Yeah, the experience was great. [LAUGH]
L:  That's great.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I'm -- I'm trying to think what -- of another, uh, good movie that I saw. [LIPSMACK] Um ... [MN] it's been a while since even before that.  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, last summer I -- I remember seeing Spiderman in the theater --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that -- that was great to see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the big s- -- on the big screen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that was, like, um, one of those types of action films that you needed a -- a --  really just, uh, big images to kinda enhance the overall experience.
R:  Right.  Like you're in the middle of it?
L:  Yeah.  So, that -- that was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a good one to see and I -- I actually did see that around mid town, I forgot which theater it was in, but I think it was near Times Square.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but it was -- it was cool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, uh --
R:  Yeah, there's been, I think, a lot of good ones come out.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ha- have -- have you -- have you joined a -- have you joined a DVD club or --
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Okay.
R:  I haven't joined a DVD club.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I haven't -- I haven't heard too much about that, so --
L:  Yeah, Net -- Net Flix is good, because you can get, um, [LIPSMACK] unlimited DVDs per month for twenty dollars a month, you just --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- re- return it back to them, uh, you know, the postage is included and all that and --
R:  Oh, good.  So, you just pay a fa- -- a flat twenty dollars and then you --
L:  Y- you get unlimited DVDs.
R:  [COUGH] And they mail 'em to you and you mail them back and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everything's covered?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  It's a -- it's a -- it's a pretty good deal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, yeah, it's -- it's getting pretty popular, I think some people it, you know, takes a while to -- to adjust from going to a store to get, you know, a DVD or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  How long is the delivery?  How long is the d- delay time, is it --
L:  Um, it's not long.  It's, u- uh, I think, like, the average is, like, three days.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, but it could be sooner.  It just -- you know, it depends on, I think, address as well, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  Do you have to join for a certain amount of time, like, could you join for, like, a month and -- or two and then --
L:  I th- -- I think they have t- -- um, w- w- -- they -- they do --
R:  Subscription?
L:  -- have free trials that you can, you know, try out for.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I -- I think they have better deals if you subscribe, like, for a year as opposed to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- month -- month by month, obviously, but, um, I think you can do it either way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I forgot, I'd have to double check that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, yeah, just go to Net Flix dot com and they'll have --
R:  Net Flix?  Is that what it's called?
L:  Yeah, Net Flix.  Yeah, N.E.T. --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- F.  -- F.L.I.X. dot com.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, that's the big online DVD store, I guess.
R:  Cool.  That's really good to know, thanks.
L:  A- absolutely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [SIGH] I don't know, that's -- that's it.  I've been really busy doing other stuff besides watching movies but I, uh, I do appreciate them from time to time and --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- they're -- they're good to escape into once in a while, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh --
R:  Yeah, I feel like I'm going to be watching more independent films though.  They always make a statement, you know, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you walk away a better -- a more knowledgeable, a thinking person of the world than just sitting --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- there and -- and having the mind go to --
L:  [MN] --
