R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  [LAUGH] Hi, I'm Sam. [COUGH]
L:  What was that?
R:  Sam.
L:  Sam?
R:  Right.
L:  Samantha?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  What's it short for, anything?  No?
R:  No, [LAUGH] just Sam.
L:  It's just Sam.  Okay, I'm Mark.
R:  Hi.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  I take it you've done this before?
L:  Once.
R:  Oh, okay, [LAUGH] me too.
L:  A long time ago.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  It's been -- it seems like they can't really connect with me very well.  I've been out on the road, so, ah, where are you from?
R:  Ah, Maine.
L:  Maine? 
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm in Lin- Atlanta Georgia.
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  I kind -- I thought it was, you know, just in this area, but --
L:  No, no I talked to somebody in Pennsylvania the last time I think, so --
R:  Yeah.  I do it 'cause I'm in New York.  So --
L:  Um.
R:  -- [MN] in Maine right now, New Jersey, ah --
L:  Mhm.  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]  Well, we are supposed to talk about how we get our news.
R:  Well, mine is on the TV whenever the news is on and the morning paper.
L:  And is that broadcast news or --
R:  World news, broadcast news.
L:  -- or, um, CNN or cable or what?
R:  Oh, oh, no.  I don't -- I do -- I don't do -- probably I [inaudible] do CNN when there's something really special on --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I do local channels and, you know, and then national news after -- you know, at night.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And the newspaper --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and there's the little newspapers.
L:  Right.
R:  I think this is a really hard topic. [LAUGH]  I also get these topics [LAUGH] and I don't know. [LAUGH]  And it's like when -- when they say [inaudible] just hang up. [LAUGH]  I ain't doing this. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, it's no big deal.  
R:  [inaudible] had a topic to -- to talk a- --
L:  At the very -- at the very worst it could possibly be is you talk for ten minutes and then you don't worry about it anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  I actually, ah, get my news from -- well, I don't have cable so I don't watch any cable TV but I get it occasionally -- when I'm on the road I get cable and I watch it briefly.  Um, I read the Washington Post on the internet some or the New York Times on the internet.  Um, it's -- it's kind of funny from my stand point because I don't put a lot of effort into watching the news and yet I seem to know a lot more about the little details than a lot of people know that watch the news more regularly.  And, um, I'm not really sure why that is. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm not -- um, it's not a [inaudible] with me.  It's not something that I have to -- I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there are a lot of people, "Oh, God, I've got to watch the news in the morning, got to watch the news at night.  Got to watch the news at eleven o'clock".  Usually I'm in bed by eleven o'clock so I don't get that news --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, I too go on the internet.  I see a, um, topic that's of interest to me then I do, you know -- I just go back and do a lot of research, right?  You know, go a little -- that they keep going and going. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, ah, and I -- I think I learn a lot more that way, you know?  But --
L:  Well, I --
R:  But --
L:  -- I stopped watching local news about --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- twenty years ago and I stopped watching, um, broadcast news about probably fifteen years.  Then I stopped watching the news on CBS about ten years ago [LAUGH] and I used to listen to NPR a lot and I stopped listening to that about two or three years ago.  I think, ah, when the present administration got in I stopped paying as much attention to all the little details because, um, it seemed like I found out more than I wanted to know, although I don't avoid it because it -- it's stupid to avoid what, um, maybe your -- if in my case the opposition party is doing.  But, um, it -- it's weird how I can -- I can find out a lot of stuff on the internet about what's going on by looking at different sites --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then -- and then researching from there than you can ever find by watching the news.
R:  'Cause you can -- I like, um, when I -- you know, when I log on and then I'll look at the headlines, you know.  And then it's kind of like picking two and then you can go on from there and you can pick up through the gaps so I find that a lot more interesting than sitting down trying to read the newspaper or, ah, sitting there in front of the TV and, you know --
L:  Right, well you --
R:  Probably, ah, most of the time when I watching [inaudible] [LAUGH] other people around me are doing it and I don't have a choice, you know?
L:  Right, like at a restaurant or at somebody else's house or something like that?
R:  Well, um, I do research that is.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And that's what I'm doing right now.  I've in here three weeks and so, you know, it's kind of like you have to something to do, you know?
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  So --
L:  -- it's funny, I, um -- I just spent two months up in Tennessee working for the federal Government on the disaster.  They had a -- a bad --
R:  Oh, you're kidding.  Oh, lucky you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm national [inaudible] for American Red Cross.
L:  Oh, really?  I -- I work --
R:  Yeah, well, I can't off from get on my map.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They will not phone us.  I mean, I haven't even got a local directory here.
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  It's so sad because I am -- I have expertise in four different fields --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and a lot of experience to work for a lot of disasters.  I can't even get out. [LAUGH]  So I said, "Lucky you". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would love to go.  I'd love to go.
L:  It's um -- I work with F.E.M.A. and I got, ah -- and I was there for two months and I work in the public information, ah, office.  I do photography but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- where -- where I was sitting was right near the media monitor and that means they have four TV's going on --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- at once with Fox News, CNN and all the local channels --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and everything is happening and --
R:  Everything over and over [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, and the weather channel as well.  And the thing is is that I, um, you know, I'm constantly going up and saying, "Can I turn these things down?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Can I please turn them off?"
R:  I know all this. [LAUGH]
L:  "I don't want to hear this anymore."
R:  It's like -- well, no, it's 'cause they're too loud, yeah, you know?
L:  It's, ah -- it's, ah, bothering some of the -- one of the people they're in there sitting there listening to all four TV's at once, and I'm going "I don't know how you do this but it's driving me nuts".
R:  Oh.
L:  So I try not to -- mainly what they're doing is they're taping stuff and they're not really trying to -- to watch it directly.  But just that many TV's the whole -- the whole concept just drives me nuts.  So I try not to get it from there but when I'm in my room, ah, at the hotel, you know, there's cable and I'll switch through and I'll see CNN headline news for five minutes and I'll probably -- it's -- it's getting to me to be like a soap opera --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where you can watch the news once every three weeks --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and know exactly what's going on.
R:  Yeah.  You're right.
L:  It's ridiculous.  And the other thing that bothers me is the -- the real lack of editorialism that's going on.  We just -- people just say exactly what the politicians say and we all know that politicians are -- are being politicians.  They're not saying anything that's true per se, they're saying what's going to be helpful to their reelection down the road or -- or their agenda in the present time.  And I'm -- I'm really tired of hearing that so I -- I pretty much have just given up listening to it [LAUGH] for the most part and I go look at alternative sites on the web to find out where the real information is.  That's -- that's the way I do it anyway.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's kind of like the way I watch it.  You know, when I'm not [inaudible] forced.  Well, I mean I could well wait.  It's like when you spend three weeks night and day [inaudible] almost nothing to do. [LAUGH]  You're kind of like drawn to [inaudible].  Um, I really did get bored in my life, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] And that's better than having boredom, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so we're making people happy. [LAUGH]  I try other opinions and all that kind of [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] to hide, but -- but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I know exactly what you're talking about I -- you know, I feel almost exactly the same way.
L:  Yeah, have you, um -- is this the first time you've talked on this -- one of these things --
R:  It's the second time.
L:  -- or you talk -- so -- second time?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's my second time as well.  I got a message saying they were looking for more men.  They have a hard --
R:  Yeah, that's what they told me too, but they took me anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  So I think --
R:  -- they were -- they were looking for a lot of men.  That's what she told me, so --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they can call me as much as they want.  If they're listening in on this, which I'm sure they are.
R:  I thought that, um -- 'cause the way I understood it was that -- oh, you can call three times in the month then you start over again or something I wonder?
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I don't know.  That's --
L:  I -- I heard something --
R:  -- what I was wondering.
L:  -- about three times, but you know the first week they called me immediately and then they didn't call for me for a long time, and then I got called away and they called me every time --
R:  Oh, they called you?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean --
R:  'Cause the way I signed up, um, I call them.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I call a number and then they tell me what this week is and they match me up with somebody.  Not -- and I can do that like three times in a month.  I don't know if -- if that's all --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that I can do it, but --
L:  Well, I think you can do it that way as well. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they called me on almost every Tuesday or Thursday, and it -- it's every day I -- I'm on the road and I call in to get my messages, they're always there.  Do you want to answer the phone --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and stuff and I'm like --
R:  I've been calling --
L:  -- "Well, sorry I can't --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- I'm not there".
R:  No, they don't want me, they want -- [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Is it, 'cause that would be kind of cool too to, um -- yeah, because this is [inaudible] time thing as far as I know.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, once -- once I've finished my three calls then I'll have --
