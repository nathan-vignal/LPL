L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Shirley.
R:  I'm Karen.
L:  Hi Karen.
R:  Where do you live Shirley?
L:  Cincinnati.  How about you?
R:  [LAUGH] Mil- -- well, m- -- used to be Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Ha- -- but we --
L:  W- --
R:  That's closest here.
L:  We're from California but --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- we've been here for ten years.
R:  Oh.  Um --
L:  And --
R:  We've lived here, pretty much, our whole life so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't even know how many years to say.  So --
L:  I think we've lived all over --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but most -- most of my life has been in California.
R:  So, what type --
L:  But --
R:  -- of hobby do you have?
L:  Well, right now, because of the weather, it's gardening.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  I [LAUGH] -- I love it.  And, ah, how --
R:  What do you --
L:  -- about you?
R:  W- well, I'm a scrap booker.
L:  Ah.
R:  Avid.  Actually, um, had been a consultant for Creative Memories for a while.
L:  Oh, wow.  You should come -- go through my [LAUGH] house.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We have all this stuff that I'd love to organize.
R:  That's what --
L:  M- --
R:  -- lots of people say. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- just so hard. [LAUGH]
R:  It is.  I understand that and actually, um, as a -- I won't even call part[?] time -- I think I'd call it a part time since I did have some ladies in our area who -- older ladies, wealthier ladies, [LAUGH] um, who I did albums for them. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I did get their stuff together.  But, um, I try to go to workshops on a monthly basis and --
L:  What --
R:  -- um, where I -- I leave the house and, yeah, I just go with other scrap bookers and it --
L:  What -- what do you do at a scrapbook workshop, huh?
R:  Well, you take --
L:  That's funny.
R:  -- your products that you're gonna work with --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you work on your albums.  And you're hosted by a consultant who is teaching, like, some type of a technique or showing new products --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and bas- -- I've been doing -- is I'm putting together my kids' albums while I'm there.
L:  That's neat.
R:  Or my family album or --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I did put together an album for each of my kids when they graduated high school.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it started, you know, with their -- ah, with me being pregnant and pictures of parents, grandparents and then it went through -- I had all the pictures that they had through grade school and high school for each year and then vacation.  I had it organized, you know, around different themes and --
R:  Mhm.  So, that's --
L:  M- --
R:  -- yeah, pretty much what I'm doing.
L:  That was so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- fun.
R:  Um, I haven't gone back and done my husbands and my individual stuff but my kids' stuff is almost finally up to date.  I have a eight --
L:  Great.
R:  -- year old and a five year old. [LAUGH] So --
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, [LAUGH] and we do lots of stuff with -- in the summer, I take lots of pictures so, um, right now I'd say -- I would have to say that photography is also another little hobby --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just because I always try to get that perfect picture.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I had done that for years and I was really involved in photography.
R:  Mm.
L:  B- -- took some classes and had a, um -- a darkroom and -- and it just got to be, kind of, overwhelming. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I quit that.
R:  -- other than the garden i- is -- what do you do in the winter then?
L:  Oh.  Well, actually, I'm a homeopath and that started out as a hobby and I still have a study group.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then when my company was bought[?] about four years ago, I had actually trained i- i- -- I -- I loved it so much I trained as a physician in Southern California for ten years. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it was a very intense hobby and I figured I would always do that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I retired.  So, when the company here was bought out and a doctor was looking for a homeopath and so I decided, "Well, I may as well make this a profession". [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  And so, you know, that turned into a profession.  Your -- your scrap booking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thing could certainly come a profession.  I'm sure --
R:  Right.
L:  -- lots of people would love just give you their shoe boxes and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Um, yes.  Well, it [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] it -- it is harder to do other people's stuff.
L:  Really?
R:  I use it, um, and I think -- I wouldn't say that I need that as my p- -- yeah, I guess I do need it as a form of relaxation at times.
L:  Yeah.  It's different when you're making a living --
R:  Right.
L:  -- out of it.
R:  Um --
L:  I -- I found that out for sure.
R:  'Cause I also use it then, like, as a social venue.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  With other women and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and things like that and ...  Um, and I [LAUGH] -- I don't -- my husband --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I don't really think he has hobbies, so to say, other than watching television.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- um, but he feels he needs to do that.  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't quite understand --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that feels[?] to me but, um, I need it as a -- as a venue to get out.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I am -- I'm an at home mom.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, um, [several inaudible words] a lot so I do spend a lotta time with kids.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And even when I'm with other moms we [inaudible] their kids.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I remember those days.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  I -- 
R:  Oh, here's a homeopath question for you -- not really related to the study --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but zinc for [inaudible] spores[?], right?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Would you use zinc for a [inaudible], right?
L:  No.  I'm a constitutional homeopath.  We don't treat diseases.
R:  [MN]
L:  We work with a vital force to [several inaudible words] so the body can heal itself.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, we don't treat any particular disease.
R:  Okay.  'Cause I had been told you use a- -- we're dealing with plant spores right now and somebody had said to use, um, zinc tablets.  Take them every day.
L:  That's not homeopathic.
R:  It's not?
L:  That's -- no.  Ha- -- that's the mineral.
R:  Well, then I guess --
L:  No.
R:  -- I'm not even thinking correctly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know what a -- I just thought it was. [LAUGH]
L:  Is it potentized zinc?
R:  What was that?
L:  Is it potentized zinc?
R:  No.
L:  Then it's --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- not, ah -- it's not an FDA approved homeopath remedy.
R:  Hm.
L:  I mean, there are -- there is a remedy made of zinc.  There is a homeopathic zinc but it has to be potentized in a particular way to get homeopathic.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it has to be prescribed by homeopathic principles is based on the similar.  Like, there's, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- perfecta [inaudible].
R:  Okay.  See, now you --
L:  So --
R:  -- taught me something.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I'll have to make it a little bit of a hobby to check this out more. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, if you're on the internet you can -- you get a lot of stuff and I could even email you a whole bunch of pages.  I'm -- I'm on the internet with about two thousand other homeopaths around the world --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- and we have, ah, reviewed a lot of the summits[?] as to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what's good and what isn't.
R:  So, do you -- do you eat[?] most things in your garden?
L:  No.  There're --
R:  A- --
L:  -- FDA approved homeopathic pharmacies that make the remedies.
R:  Okay.  So, you don't --
L:  So, um --
R:  -- even doing anything on your own? [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Uh-uh.  Nah.  There is no way --
R:  'Cause that would be like cooking, right? [LAUGH]
L:  -- that would just -- the equipment would just be phenomenal but, ah --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to do that.
R:  I just -- I -- like I --
L:  I- --
R:  -- said, you hear all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kinds of things.  'Cause I --
L:  Homeopathy is not herbalism.
R:  Oh, it isn't?
L:  Not at all.  It's not all related.
R:  Okay.  For some reason I've --
L:  No.  It -- it's --
R:  -- been always under the misunderstanding that, I guess, it was that.
L:  No.  It's not.
R:  Oh.  Well, see, I've learned little things [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- certainly on -- we've been --
L:  And --
R:  -- investing money on these vitamin C --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, zinc tablets from the GNC store for [LAUGH] a while and that didn't do anything for my daughter's foot.  Now, maybe that's explaining why.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, um --
L:  But you could look at the National Center for Homeopathy and there's a site there that will a- allow you to find homeopaths in your area.
R:  Oh, okay.  Thank you.
L:  And they have a lot of good information.
R:  So, are you --
L:  And then --
R:  -- are you married?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Are you married?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Does your --
L:  Granted.
R:  -- husband have a hobby?
L:  Um, he works around the house.  We have a hundred year old Queen Anne that he's been renovating --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- for the last [inaudible] teen years and that's gonna continue on.  But that's what he does in his spare time.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then we've got grandkids so, of course, you know, with grandkids you hardly need a hobby.  They're pretty time consuming.
R:  Well --
L:  And, ah [LAUGH] --
R:  Ah, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  And then [LAUGH] --
R:  I w- -- I guess when my -- and I do have my kids -- I guess they are time consuming but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't have them very often so [LAUGH] I can't --
L:  And, ah --
R:  -- relate on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that side. [LAUGH]
L:  And the other thing that I've recently gotten involved in is the Siamese rescue.
R:  Oh, what?
L:  Siamese rescue.  Siamese cats a- --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- rescue.  And I got -- I got on the internet one night and, you know, was just looking up some information on Siamese because somebody had asked me -- 'cause I've always had Siamese -- and found this wonderful site and they -- ah, I haven't done anything yet with them but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we can't foster any cats 'cause we've already got three [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and that's enough but, ah, they do ask for people who can help transport.  So, I travel quite a bit so when I do, I let 'em know where I'm going and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and hopefully, they'll have a Meser that needs be moved from a foster home to his permanent home.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Begin --
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Do that.  Yeah.  I --
R:  I've known -- I know that they're starting to have a -- I have a dog --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, we've noticed that more of the breeds seem to have some type of a complete rescue group that just deals that, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- breed.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where, like, the Humane Society, you know, takes 'em all. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But we've had, um, [LIPSMACK] like, Bloodhound rescues and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Greyhound rescues and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Dalmatian rescues and stuff.  So, a lot of that [inaudible] be really big in our area for those three types of dogs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's there.
L:  I know Dalmatian des- -- rescue is really big because after A Hundred and One Dalmatians came out everybody got a Dalmatian and they had no idea, you know --
R:  How terrible they are? [LAUGH]
L:  -- how [LAUGH] -- how difficult -- how much time and exercise and everything else they need, you know?
R:  Right.  We have one of those right across the street from us -- I hate it.  Sorry.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm an animal lover at heart but I hate that dog. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  They're a little hyper.
R:  It's -- it's fine with my kids.  It's just mean to me and growl at me and that's fine --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because --
L:  That's not good.
R:  -- um, dogs norm don't do that to me but this dog seems to, like, sense that I don't like it.  So --
L:  And maybe he's been too inbred or something.
R:  [LAUGH] Well -- well, that's --
L:  And there were a lot of puppy farms springing up when h- --
