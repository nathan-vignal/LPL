R:  Hi, my name is Amanda.
L:  Hi Amanda, my name is Mary Beth.
R:  Hi, how are you doing today?
L:  Ah, good.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing good.  It's my day off.
L:  Not interrupting a -- a -- am I interrupting a computer game?  [LAUGH]
R:  No, not at the moment.  [LAUGH] I was getting ready to wrap some gifts for my son [LAUGH] so [COUGH] he, um, I actually have some computer games here I'm getting ready to wrap for him though.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, my boys love them also.
R:  Yeah, well.
L:  They love them.
R:  My son is three years old, so he's learning to use the computer and I got him some, ah, I got him the Tonka Trucks, ah, what is it, Search And Rescue game and, ah, I don't remember, something else, oh, the Land --
L:  Oh, so.
R:  -- Before Time Preschool.
L:  Oh, he'll love that one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He'll love it, my guys like the Reader Rabbit ones.
R:  Yeah, I got him one of those but because, I -- I don't know, he just -- he likes books better as books [LAUGH].  He doesn't like to read on the computer for some reason.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  He's got [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, oh, well, they like the interactive ones.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  At least that my kids do, where you get to --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to find the way through the maze and things like that.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  So, I don't, um, unless it's for me, I don't buy a game that I play.  I play ones like online, like I --
R:  Yeah, I do the same thing.
L:  -- I've -- I play --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Cribbage all the time.  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I try to download some of them and though, the -- the most of the ones that you can download for free, they'll only have, ah, like a certain time period that you can play them or certain amount of times that you can play them and then they cut you off and say you have to pay for them.
L:  Oh, that's terrible.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  That is terrible.
R:  That's what I get for trying to cheat I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, see I don't think so 'cause they want to get --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you to their site, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go to, um, Yahoo sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's how I play Cribbage but it's not -- it -- it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- freezes which is really frustrating if you're doing really well.
R:  Yeah, I've gotten out of that a lot because I kept on losing and losing and losing and people were complaining about me.  I don't know if it's because my computer is slower because I've got so much on it, or what's wrong with it but I -- just -- it kept on freezing on me and it'd be like ten minutes and I'd come back and people had nasty comments on there about why wasn't I playing.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- oh that's -- I hate that.
R:  Yeah, so I -- I don't really like that so.
L:  Yeah, it's not as fun.  I used to go to, um, I won dot com and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- play some of the games, the free ones on that, except that those guys, I swear, give out your name to every- -- your email to everyone in the whole world and --
R:  That's what I discovered.
L:  -- then you get spammed, it's awful.
R:  Yeah, I haven't -- I went on there and played w- -- after, right after I set up, you know, the account with, um, and I went on there and played one game and I started getting hundreds of junk emails.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  I couldn't believe it and that's the only thing I could think of, it had to be them.
L:  Yeah, and -- and specially 'cause some of them are fr- from casinos which is like, "Hello".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's definitely.  [LAUGH]
L:  So.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- if --
R:  Well, I'm kind of stuck on Roller Coaster Tycoon right now, it's something a friend of mine copied for me, the se- -- he copied me the second pack of it so I -- I was kind of playing that some the other night and I -- I get stuck on that and I'm putting the people here and there and the roller coasters and [LAUGH] --
L:  That sounds cool, so -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you get to set it up?
R:  Yeah, you get to set it up.  They'll start you out, depending on how, [SIGH] ah, a- a- advanced you are, I guess the word would be [LAUGH], um, they set you up either with one that's already been set up and you can make it better and then you have to have like a certain amount of guests in the park and have a certain amount of money by the end of certain -- a year or --
L:  Oh, what fun.
R:  -- you can just go blank and start from the beginning.
L:  Sounds like a simulation, is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Different things would happen over the course of time that makes --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it a success or not.  Oh, that would be cool.
R:  Yeah, you have to -- it'd be like some rides are unpopular and every once in a while you'll get a ride where it'll -- it'll run off the tracks and kill people [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, gosh.  [LAUGH] Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and so then it's -- it's no po- -- it's not popular anymore and it starts losing money for the park and all --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- this and that and you have to advertise for the park.  I was just always -- it's -- it's funny. [MN] I cut that off the other night, I said, "I can't do that anymore, I'll be on there for hours playing with that little thing", 'cause it's just takes so long.
L:  Uh-huh, it does, it gets addictive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband plays one with his friends that they all -- they had to buy the game but they can network it together --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and so you have to buy it -- you buy the software but then you go to some website and it all hooks in and it's one of these bang, bang, shoot 'em up --
R:  Oh, I've heard of those, yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, just things that I don't want my kids to -- to see --
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  -- but of course, there he is, the big example, right, and he, it's amazing, he -- he'll be on the phone, there was a headset plugged in 'cause he's talking with one of his buddies who's on his team --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, it's like, "How old are you?"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But no, he'll spend hours, hours shooting and, oh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- my god, ah --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it is amazing.
R:  I remember, a couple of years ago I used to do the same thing.  I -- I wasn't able to talk on the phone at the same time but [LAUGH] I'd be there typing, I'd have my -- my, ah, game up on one side of the screen and then I'd have my -- my little, ah, gabbing machine on the other side.
L:  Oh, your little like chat window?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my little chat window on the other side and I'd be there chat -- chatting with my cousin or with somebody over here and playing a game with them on the other side and having a bunch of people over there, and, oh, my goodness, it just got so wild.  [LAUGH] It picked my typing skills up really good though.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he tells me it does.  [LAUGH] It does, it does.
R:  I -- I -- I could find the letters real quick but, ah, the words kind of got cut off in the middle every now and then.  [LAUGH]
L:  That is so funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My kids though, they're -- they, I swear, our -- our generation, ah, the -- the -- w- -- the generation we're raising --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they are -- they're gonna be so much better.  Their, ah, dexterity is amazing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they beat me already on -- when we're doing different things, like you try to --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- move the little guy right, left or jump or make him hop.  My son is, um, he's so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so good at it.
R:  It's -- it's the know it all in every kid.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, and it just seems to come naturally to them.
R:  Because their -- their minds are so much younger than ours, they can pick it up so much faster and -- and I -- I don't know, it just works -- their brains work faster with these games I guess.  Mhm.
L:  I know, I'm -- I'm nervous though because my oldest is in, well he's going into the first grade --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the games that, you know, his little kindergarten friends who have all the brothers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all of a sudden he is getting [inaudible] exposed to games that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I would rather him not play.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's har- -- it's really -- it's hard 'cause, um, I'm sure all the other mothers think I'm the big, um, you know, I don't know what you call it -- overprotective one.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I don't though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't even let my son watch cartoons.  He can watch -- the only ones he can watch is like Stanley and Winnie the Pooh and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, those educational ones.  I- I- We don't even let him watch Sesame Street any more 'cause that's gotten so horrible.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I, you know, it's just --
R:  And I remember when I was a kid I used to watch it all the time, and you look at these computer games and everything that's based on all this stuff and they've got 'em in there fighting and all this stuff.  I don't want my son to do that.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Remember in --
R:  I want him to --
L:  -- remember when we got, they just -- they're getting points for killing, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I've seen that.
L:  That life is -- yeah, it's just -- that's not the message we want them to --
R:  Yeah, it's like the Nintendo, ha.  When I was younger it was Nintendo, and now it's the computer games and -- and the worst thing is, they can get on the computer and find anything they want.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just, by accident one time, went on there and I typed in an address wrong and I got this porno thing, and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ever since then, I --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- every time I go into my Windows Messenger, I get all these porno things will take over my computer and start popping up --
L:  Yeah.  All these --
R:  -- and I have to alt delete, [LAUGH] you know, alt control delete to get rid of it, because --
L:  Yeah.  Ah, you know, I just found a utility to stop pop up windows [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from coming up on me because it was very frustrating and, yeah, you make one mistake and then they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they come.  And that's -- i- it's just -- it's really -- I really hope that their -- the legislation gets a lot stronger as far as grading games, 'cause I noticed that at this Christmas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, there was different grades on the software games, and like people in stores were not supposed to sell them to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- kids that were under seventeen, and so then I saw this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- undercover thing on, it was like, I don't know twenty twenty or sixty minutes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they went undercover and it was showing all these stores selling ten year old kids these horrible --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- very violent and --
R:  Well, even if they don't sell it to the younger kids, the older kids have it and the younger kids play with them at home.
L:  Right.
R:  And the parents aren't at home to see it, because we're all working, you know, or they're in the other room and the kid just pops it in and they know how to play all that stuff.
L:  Yeah, I know --
R:  They know it all, plus the fact that half of them are taking karate lessons.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  [MN] Yeah --
