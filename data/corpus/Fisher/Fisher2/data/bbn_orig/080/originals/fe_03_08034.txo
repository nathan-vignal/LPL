R:  Hi, my name is Kristen.  How are you?
L:  Good.  My name is Krista.  I'm not really sure what's going on.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, we're trying to talk about computer games, whether you play them on the internet or on the cd-rom or -- and what your favorite computer game is.  We're just supposed to talk about it for ten minutes.
L:  Okay.  Ah, do you play games?
R:  [LAUGH] I used to play games.  I used to play Soldier of Fortune, but I don't really play those games any more.  Um, I leave that more to, um, my --

L:  I think Quentin plays that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But I -- usually on cd-rom, not on that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or more like a private network I play.  [PAUSE]
R:  Right.  We do both on cd-rom or, um, if we're going to have a land party, then we'll do it just within the house, or, but -- when I used to play it, I used to play just on the internet, 'cause I need people who played it too, so then we were just going to [inaudible] play together.
L:  Yeah, it's like -- like a private line where you could go over, try the [inaudible] and do it that way, if you know people.  Yeah.  But I [inaudible], so I don't know.  [PAUSE] At all.
R:  Right.  Right.

R:  So, how long did you play that game for?
L:  I don't [inaudible] as much, so I -- and I just ran out of time in my life.  I started -- you know, I got a full time job so I just don't have to play.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah?  [PAUSE]  That's how I was.  I mean, I have three kids, so with three kids I just couldn't do it any more --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  There was just no time, right?
R:  -- 'cause I used to play all the time, but now I'm more involved with their schooling and everything, so I just don't do it any more.  [PAUSE] Yeah, there was just no time.  But I used to -- when I did like it --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  It was only fun, I always like beating all the boys when they get so mad.  
R:  I -- it was fun, it was a challenge, um, trying to get good.  [LAUGH] 'Cause I -- I don't think I was ever really that good, but yeah, I have [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] They definitely don't like that, that's for sure.  But other than that, I haven't played Quake at all.

R:  No, they don't. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I [inaudible] Hawk for a while though.

L:  Yeah.  It's so much -- and then you know, like little games like Solitaire and The Game of Life.  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you?  My son likes that.  He likes that a lot.

R:  And it's -- Uh-huh.  Oh, wow.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Right.  I'll have to go look for that.  I haven't done that in a long time.  I broke my wrist like three weeks ago, so I -- just being on the computer --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it -- it -- you know on a computer you have to have two hands --

L:  Those are the [inaudible] that all --
R:  -- capability of using two hands --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, I mean, it's just really hard for me.  Can't type, can't do anything.

L:  Very nice.  Um, have you ever played, ah, Everquest?
R:  Wow.  Is that -- has a lot of the --
L:  At all?  No.  Yeah, that's just kind of scary, hey?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never played it.
R:  I just got a -- right, I just got out of the pool, so -- yes.
L:  Mhm.  [PAUSE]
R:  No, no, no.
L:  [LAUGH] No.  They play it so long.
R:  Well, I -- I've watched people play it because my friend plays it, you know, and he's always sitting.  And he's doing this -- it's repetitious, he does --
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  -- the same thing over and over and I'm like, "Don't you get tired of doing the same thing --"
L:  Yeah, just --
R:  "-- over and over for twenty hours?"
L:  -- shouldn't we be, you know, trying to save something here?
R:  I mean, how are you --
L:  And they -- they --  they do it all the time.  They play constantly.  I've -- I've heard people play Everquest and that's all they do, their whole entire day.  They just play Everquest.
R:  Yeah, they do.  He's been playing it for like four years, and I'm like, "Can't you find something else to do?  I mean he's sitting there, he's not doing anything.  He's gaining points.  I'm like, "For what?"
L:  It's an insane game.
R:  "I mean, you're sitting there.  You're not doing anything.  You should be doing something."
L:  I know.  I would never play that game.  Just like on principle.  It --
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible]
L:  I used to tell people who, um -- my cousin met her husband on Everquest, and they're --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.
L:  -- married now.  They met playing Everquest.  [LAUGH] 
R:  They're like make up their life.
L:  It's so --
R:  I couldn't --  I couldn't do it -- forget it.  No.  That's how I am, like, "No.  Forget it.  I can't do it any more.  No."
L:  I mean he lives in Texas, and she lived up here and -- [inaudible] but they live in Texas.  [LAUGH] I know.  Ah, just got married two months ago, because I think there's odd that they wait a certain amount of time to get my cousin over.  But she said it was very complicated, but they've been together for like four years since they started dating.  And they met on Everquest.   It's very bizarre.  [LAUGH] I play -- I play chess with my -- I play chess [several inaudible words], that's pretty fun.  On --

R:  Oh, wow.  That's weird.  I don't -- go ahead --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Who did I play?  I think it was pool, [MN], I think it was pool, but I'm not sure.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  Or you can put it on your PDA [inaudible].  No.  [LAUGH] It's not pool.  It's definitely not the pool.
R:   It was so long ago that I played pool.  Some guy I had met on the internet, and I've known him on the internet now for like years.  I talk to him all the time, and he was like, "Let's play pool."  I'm like, "No."  'Cause I think it was pool, but yeah, that was a weird game to play.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  What if they have like pool competitions --
R:  Like you just go and play pool on the internet, it just takes -- it is just not the same, sorry.
L:  The pool -- I don't -- oh, I love the Sims.
R:  It's just not the same.  Nah, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] I --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my brother in law's telling me he's the internet pool shark.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  No, not me.
L:  I know.  I've --
R:  I know, I don't.  I wonder --
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  I did, ah -- I used to get the cheat code for the Sims, right?  
R:  [inaudible] I used to play the Sims.  I played the Sims until I was so bored, because I had so much money and there was nothing for me to do, and then -- and then all these, like, the new, um --
L:  And get like -- get like a million dollars and build like this [inaudible].  I did a whole entire, ah, I did [several inaudible words] with Sims.

L:  It's -- it's a pretty cool -- you do like screen shots of all the way that you want the roofs to look and if you built -- I mean, you can't build the who- -- the whole complex, but you can build each room and then, you know, [inaudible] down and, so you get a [several inaudible words] right.  It was pretty cool though, my professor was pretty impressed.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yep, I did too.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH] Did you?  Oh -- On the stands, that would be cool.  I never thought about that.  I'm going to keep that game, just in case one day when my kids have to do something like that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's -- yeah, exactly, 'cause you're not a Sims.  It's great.  I love that game.
R:  Yeah.  I never thought of that.
L:  I -- I don't like the -- I don't like the killing games so much, it's just the --
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, yeah, that one's  -- or, um, [inaudible].  
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, yeah, [LAUGH] and, ah -- and [inaudible] park one.  
R:  I bet that'd be pretty cool.  I never thought of something like that.  You di- designing your own house.  Let's do it on Sims.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've played that one.  In Sim city.  I love all those strategy games like that.
R:  Let's do it on the Sims.  Yeah, I like that.  I was going to -- I was going to try to play --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, I just -- I like cute games, I guess.  I don't know, I'm weird.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  
R:  Now I don't like to [inaudible] Monopoly Tycoon.  That was pretty fun.  Yeah, I like [several inaudible words] and then -- 
L:  I definitely have the hand eye coordination to do this.  Or the strategy games.  You don't need hand eye coordination, you need to be able to think.  [inaudible]  I know, I find they suck a lot of the time, so you're like, "This is [inaudible] play this game any more", and just walk away.
R:   Rollercoaster Tycoon, I have that too.  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, I have that one too.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Those are fun, they take a lot -- I don't know, thy just -- 
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  -- okay, you have to think about it you know, and I don't know, [several inaudible words] you don't have to think about it after a while, it was just like, "Well, I suck at this game and I'm very bored."  [LAUGH] "I'm not playing it any more."
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  My baby's going to die.
R:  No, I don't. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [PAUSE] Yeah, "I'm not playing this game any more."  Yeah.  That's what you have to do, until I got all the cheats for the Sims before all the packages came out.  I was like on it all the time.  "I've got to get more money.  I gotta get more money".  And then it was like, "I need to make this baby live.  [LAUGH] I need to keep this baby alive."  [LAUGH] I have like three of the -- my baby died.  I had like three that died, [LAUGH] or got taken away.  I'm like, "This is horrible, I'm a bad mom." --
