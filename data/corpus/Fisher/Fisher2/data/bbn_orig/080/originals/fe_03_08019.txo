R:  Hi, I'm Julie and I live in Hawaii.
L:  Hi, I'm Jackie, I live in Georgia.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi Jackie.
L:  How are you doing?  [COUGH]
R:  Good, I was just sitting here when they told me the -- the topic of the day and I'm sitting here thinking, god, what was that last movie I saw?
L:  Oh, um, [LIPSMACK] I am in the same boat.  I've got two kids and I'm sure it was animated, whatever it was.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, I don't remember.
R:  I know, I don't either.  I remember, ha, I went to something.  Oh, I remember what it was, the last movie I saw was, um, [LIPSMACK] Bruce Almighty.
L:  [MN] Okay.
R:  Do you remember that one?  Do you --
L:  I only remember --
R:  -- remember what that was about?  That's where, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, Adam Sandler plays -- is that Adam Sandler that plays in that?  No, who is that?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And they -- and they're god, right.
L:  Yeah, okay.  I remember seeing, I think, it must have been a commercial for that one because I know, I haven't even been enough to even see a decent trailer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, yeah.  I -- I think the last thing that I saw was, um ... it might have been like Finding -- ah, I don't remember, mm, mm, [MN] [LIPSMACK] I really --
R:  Were you thinking of Finding Forrester?
L:  No, I was thinking --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I was getting that confused with Nemo, but we haven't seen a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Nemo.  [LAUGH]
R:  You must have young kids.
L:  I do.  My daughter is five and we have a son that's, um -- he -- he turned one early spring.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, yeah, everything we see is animated, rated G.
R:  So, it must be easier for you to watch 'em at home then?
L:  Well, it would be, but, i- um, I don't have -- I don't really -- it's hard for me just to concentrate on one thing if I'm at home --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so we don't even rent movies because, I mean, I would be, you know, feeling the need to do something else --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- rather than just watch the movie.
R:  So, it's hard for you to relax at home in other words.
L:  Yes, it is, it is.  So, do you rent movies?
R:  Well, no.  I actually -- I used to but it's funny because my daughter and I moved out to a piece of property that doesn't have electricity, and so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we have a solar system that runs our house and it limits the amount of electricity we can use and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so now that we can only run one twenty seven inch TV at a time, right --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- we -- yeah, we, um -- so we -- we end up watching the same TV and we take turns picking the shows and I hardly ever rent videos any more because we got -- we ended up getting a satellite dish, but even still, I got the one with the least amount of package, right, I didn't get the extra movies or any of the extra stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, for us, it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, we -- we don't rent movies any more, when I used to do it a lot, but then we didn't have a satellite, we only had the four regular stations.  But now, you know, we don't watch TV enough to really warrant renting the movies because we don't hardly watch the TV.  And she's become a better reader and a better student sin- since we moved here too, and she's fifteen and a half.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, so it's really -- and we've been in the house since, ah, December last -- well, Christmas of this last year.  So, since we've been in this house, she got straight As the last six months in school.
L:  Oh, that's great. 
R:  First time ever in the history of her being in school, and since, you know, however many years of school, she got straight As and I attribute it to less TV watching.  She comes home in the afternoon and she either reads a book --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- increasing her reading comprehension, or she does homework and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so we do -- but we do go to the -- the movies on the weekends because, you know, of course it's the social scene for my daughter, you know, we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- live in a pretty remote area, so for her to -- to -- for us, like, we live down by the -- the -- the surf break and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we're a mile from the ocean but at the same time there's no, really, nothing to do in our town, so we drive into Hilo on the weekends and she'll usually see all the other kids at the mall where the movie theater is.
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  So, it's more like even a social out- -- a social outlet for her, you know.  So, I usually go in and I watch a movie by myself or with a friend and then she meets her friends at the mall and she sees whatever movie.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  So, we -- we actually do, we go out to the movies, you know, probably a couple of times a month, ah, sometimes even as much as every weekend.  But, um, she's gone on Maui to see her dad now so I haven't been to the movies.  I'd love to go but [LAUGH] I'm too busy working.
L:  Well, I'm curious, just because, um, I've -- I've visited -- we visited there before the, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Hawaii the state, but how much are the movies?
R:  Oh, we -- our movies, I think, you know, if you go, ah, when it's the cheaper time of the day, like before five thirty or six thirty or something, it's, like, five fifty.
L:  Oh, that's not bad.  I was thinking that it may well have been more there because so many other things were.
R:  Well, you know what, actually we're on an outer island.  We're on the big island, and so it's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- not like being on Waikiki.  Waikiki, I bet the tickets are probably seven fifty, eight dollars for the cheapest ticket.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, and ours at night, like if you go at night it's seven fifty a ticket.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's not bad at all.
R:  Yeah.  Why, how much are they where you live?
L:  Um, we have -- we do go, um, the early shows just because the kids are --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- up, but they tend to be, I guess about the same, maybe about five dollars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, if you go before six or five, you know, something like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so that's what, um -- that's when we go.
R:  It's a lot cheaper to do it the other way, yeah, to go rent videos than it is to go out to the movie theater?
L:  Yes it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It is.
R:  Must be a little difficult too with young children to try and take 'em to a theater too.
L:  It is because, well for me, I'm so concerned about, like my son, and I don't want him -- have anyone else to have a bad experience so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we have to [MN] go to movies that are kid friendly 'cause you know there are going to be other kids there or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we just don't go because I just -- I don't -- I mean, I just don't -- I know that they have to learn at some point but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't -- n- not going to risk that learning curve on somebody else.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you can always teach them that at home, like, "Oh shush honey, we're watching the movie now".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, in a free environment for -- for you and them too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, exactly.  Yeah, but I -- I, ah -- there is something to be said, like you say, it's hard for me to be undisturbed at home, like even since we started this phone call, my phone's beeped twice --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and here I am just trying to have a ten minute call with you and I'm like trying to, you know -- two people are trying to call me so imagine if I was sitting here trying to watch a movie at home --
L:  Yeah, you've got --
R:  -- I'd have the same thing going on.
L:  Mhm, you have, you know, phone calls, and then you looking around, you know, and you s- -- "Oh, I need to do that, I need to do this", it's just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I -- I know that that wouldn't work and so I don't even do -- um, we've got a dish too but, um, I don't do pay per view for that same reason.
R:  Yeah.  And you know, one thing I -- when I di- -- when I did this house, I planned this house, it was a house I -- I got to, you know, pick, you know, 'cause I built it with my brother, and, ah --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so I got to design it the way I wanted it, and I have an island kitchen where the stove, ah, the re- -- the sink and everything faces outside and then the -- but the stove faces the, um, TV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I can stand -- so usually we don't turn our TV on 'til, like, six thirty at night and I'll stand behind it and I'll be able to watch TV and cook.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, so that's kind of cool and I like that, you know, but, it's like you say though, you know, you get in the movie theater and the first thing I do when I go to the movie theater is turn off my cell phone.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Because like you say, you don't want to disturb people around you and yet it allows for you to relax.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think that -- that the -- and plus the movie theater's air-conditioned.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, oh, yeah.  So, is your home not?
R:  No, uh-uh, because, ah, it's, um, all I got --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to do is open all the windows, and because I -- I situated the house according to, um, which way the trade winds blow, and the trade winds blow eighty percent of the time.  So, as long as I have all my windows open, the house stays nice and cool, I never need air conditioning or heating or anything like that.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  I know.  But it is nice because it does get hot when you go into town, and so the air conditioning -- by the time I drive to town I'm ready for the air conditioning of the movie theater --
L:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's something to be said for the cool and the dark as far as relaxing too.
L:  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  But I don't spend a lot of money in the, um, snack bars or anything either.
L:  Oh, mhm, mhm.  I usually -- like I'll buy something for my daughter and, but, you know, it's easy to go overboard there too 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it -- it is so -- it's so expensive.
R:  Yep.  Hey, you know, we just had a movie theater in our town that, um, I guess it wasn't getting enough people and it was -- it's a nice theater and they started charging a dollar at the most expensive time and fifty cents for the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- matinees.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now that's a good thing.  Are they first run or are these movies that have been out for --
R:  No, they're -- they're, actually, you know that movie Holes, the Disney movie?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That one's playing this weekend and I wanted to go see it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause that was just released like, you know -- I mean, it was just playing in the main theater about a month ago.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's good.
R:  And I -- I heard it's a real good movie too and it's a -- it's a kids movie, it's a Disney movie but I heard it was really good.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, I -- I was thinking, oh, for a buck you can't hardly go wrong.
L:  Oh, yeah, mhm.  Y- you can't e- --
R:  But the hard part is driving to town and back.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd rather stay home and -- and probably watch TV at home than drive, especially if it's going to be, like, after dark, I'd just as soon be home than be driving around.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you live in a rural area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or a town?
L:  No.  We're, um -- we're just a little bit north of Atlanta.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, yeah, we're -- we're in a pretty, um -- it's -- it's not a rural environment by any stretch of the means.
