L:  [NOISE]
R:  Give me some -- write down some other names of movies.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Nancy.  Who are you?
L:  Marilyn.
R:  Well, hi Marilyn.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  That's good.
R:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about movies for ten minutes.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, I would prefer to rent them.  What about you?
L:  Um, certain ones I would prefer to rent, ah, or buy.  I usually buy mine on DVD.
R:  Right.
L:  But certain movies, I would like to see 'em on the big screen.
R:  Like which one -- which one did you really like seeing on the big screen?
L:  Um, I really liked seeing, um, Spiderman on the big seen -- big screen.
R:  Oh yes, I ca-, yes.
L:  Yeah, and I liked, ah, The Incredible Hulk on the big screen.
R:  Oh, you've seen that one already?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, is that -- I bet that is -- I bet that would be something to see on the big screen.
L:  Right, right, and it was good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do you -- do you like to re-watch any movies, like, you know, more than once?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Usually when I get 'em on DVD, I usually watch 'em, um, maybe like six times --
R:  Really.
L:  -- within a year --
R:  Do you have a favorite movie?
L:  -- if it's something that I really like I will --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- watch it over and over again, yeah.
R:  Yeah, do you have a favorite movie that you have now?
L:  That I like, ah, I would have to say Blade, the first one.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's a good one.
L:  The second one was good but the first one was the best.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- me, I'm a -- I'm a sucker for, like, Anne of Green Gables.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  I still like, I've -- I've even read all the books that she has --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- out, quite a few L. M. Montgomery[?], ah, you wouldn't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- realize it but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that comes on PDF too sometimes.
L:  Right, yeah, yeah it does.
R:  And, ah, last night I watched a movie with my husband on TV and it was a Arnold Schwarzenegger movie called Sixth Day.
L:  Yeah.  I have that one on DVD.  I think I've seen that one maybe about three times.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that wasn't too bad.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, what do you think the benefits of, like, going to the movie is over watching it off the DVD?
L:  I think it's more so the atmosphere.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, because it's -- I guess because when you're sitting there and you got the big screen and you watch, like, action movies -- I like mostly action movies --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if stuff jump out at you it --
R:  Right.  See -- makes it seem more real.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Right, no --
L:  It gives you that better effect and then I -- I think, maybe, the smell of the popcorn.
R:  I was going to say, how much --
L:  You know [inaudible].
R:  -- money do you end up spending, like, when you go?
L:  Usually -- I usually go during matinee time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's me and three kids --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I'm usually up about twenty one dollars.
R:  Oh, that's not too bad.
L:  Right.
R:  For all the -- that, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's not too bad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And do you ever sneak your own food in?
L:  No, because --
R:  No, you just buy it there.
L:  -- they like the popcorn, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We -- we usually make it a movie night.  We go to the mov- -- we usually stop and eat first --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then we go to the movies, and then they have their popcorn.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, huh, they have to have the popcorn.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what are the ages of the kids that like going to the movies?
L:  Ah, I have a nineteen, a thirteen and a four year old.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  You're a busy mom.
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That would mean the movie subject too, you'd bet -- that'd be something to have them all like the same movie.
L:  Right, right.  And -- and normally they do.  I sent the two oldest with the little one to see, ah, Finding Nemo --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- and they really liked it.
R:  I had seen on TV some clips of that, that -- they said that they even went, like, um, under water and did research to see how things moved and everything --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- so that they'd get it right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess it -- it turned out pretty good, eh?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Because my daughter, she saw the same thing on Disney --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but they were showing, like, the behind the scenes and everything.
R:  Right, I must have -- we must have seen the same thing.
L:  Right, and she was saying, "I couldn't believe it, that it made the movie so much better because I had seen, like, the behind the scenes and how they actually did everything", before she went to see it.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and she's nineteen and she was saying how much she really liked it.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That sounds like one that we would like to see too probably.  See my kids are all grown now so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- like, ah, my youngest one is thirty.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You don't happen to have a single son do you?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [LAUGH] No, my youngest is a son --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and he's -- he's four.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Anyway, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- let's see what else.  Um, I guess, ah, the movies that I would like re-watching usually are the action movies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, where there's a lot of, ah, action going on, like car chases and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but otherwise not.  I have a real hard time watching a movie twice.  Do you?
L:  Um, no.  No I don't.  It's probably because I watch movies all the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Even, like, the family movies, I think my son's favorite movie has to be Toy Story.
R:  Yes, I've seen that --
L:  [LAUGH] and we have it on --
R:  -- now that one I could see twice, yeah.
L:  Right, I think we've probably seen it, maybe ten times a month we watch it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, he watches it over and over and over again --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and within that time I usually watch it with him, you know, most of the time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so within a months time we probably watch it maybe ten times.
R:  Yeah, I think we've probably [several inaudible words].
L:  So, that's something that I could probably still, you know, even now I --
R:  Me too, yeah.
L:  -- could put in, watch it again.
R:  Yeah, me too.  I -- I think they do a really good job with those.  I wonder if they're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- going to have another one coming out?
L:  Oh, I hope so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And let's see, what other -- are you into any romances or anything like that?
L:  Ah, yeah.  I have a few of those -- um, my husband is a James Bond buff so [LAUGH] he likes to see James --
R:  Ah, you know that movie, Somewhere in Time, ah --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- have you ever heard of that?  Th- --
L:  I have heard of it, but I haven't seen it.  But the people that have seen it says that it's fantastic.
R:  Um, that was shot just a few miles from our house --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- where I live in Michigan and, ah, Mackinaw Island is just in the -- in Lake Huron there a little bit from us --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- so that was of great interest to us to see the movie --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and Christopher Reeve was in it, so that makes it kind of nice.
L:  Right.
R:  So, ah, I think Jane Seymour too.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, it's not a bad movie and -- and it was shot in, ah, The Grand Hotel, which --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- is on the island.  It's an actual hotel on the island --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they used that for the -- for where they were staying, so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- so that was kind of interesting.  And then --
L:  Right, for you to actually see it and then see things that's close to home.
R:  Yeah, and then they were shooting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- part of Die Hard movie here, trying to find some snow and my daughter extra -- actually got to be an extra in it.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, it was at the airport, ah, when they were getting off the plane she was --
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  -- in some of those people
L:  -- that was in the -- in the two -- Die Hard Two, the second --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one, right.
R:  Yeah, she was in there, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- but I have to watch really quick to see her, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, [LAUGH] it would be nice to have the DVD then you can pause it and freeze frame right at that exact spot.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's kind of fun when they -- the kid -- maybe your kids will get to be an extra in one of the movies sometime.
L:  Right.
R:  If they shoot in your area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that was always --
L:  I don't think they've had too many of them here.  I'm in Wisconsin, so they haven't had too of -- too many of them here.  I think maybe two --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, movies that they shot here.
R:  Yeah, they just did one in the U.P., ah, not too long ago with Jeff Daniels in it --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and we haven't seen that one yet, but we'll probably rent that one.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know if it got off the ground or not, ah, as far as, you know, in the movie ratings.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was something.  I can't remember the name of it even, um --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- something about the U.P.  I can't -- I can't remember.
L:  I haven't heard of that one.
R:  Yeah, if you ever in the video store, if you see Jeff Daniels there, look and you might -- you might see one --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- 'cause it, I mean, w-, ah, the U.P., over that way, that is -- ah, I think it was like shot in Escanaba or something.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, that's not too far from Wisconsin really.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, oh, can you think of any other subjects?  We've probably got a few more minutes.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] um --
R:  Um, the m- --
L:  -- I don't know, so what type of drama movies do you like?
R:  Um, you were talking about James Bond there earlier --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we're in to that, ah --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- ah, big time too and that's kind of drama, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's action also --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, we haven't seen the latest one though.  Did your husband see the latest one?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Die Another Day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We just purchased that one.  I think it came out on DVD, ah, two weeks ago.
R:  Ah, and what's the name of the -- the woman that starred in that, um?
L:  Ah, Halle Berry.
R:  Yeah, she just broke her arm --
L:  Oh, did she?
R:  -- in doing another movie.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I know she was in X Men.
R:  Yes.
L:  That, ah, X Two.
R:  That's maybe the one she broke it in.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm not sure, that sounds familiar though.  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had just read that.  She sure is pretty.
L:  Yeah, yes she is.
R:  And, ah, let's see -- 
L:  I think they said her mom is from England.
R:  What?
L:  Her mom is from England.
R:  Oh, is she really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Wow, I think she's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she probably -- she was the voted the most beautiful woman in the world or something, I think she is.
L:  Yeah, yes she is.
R:  Yeah, she sure doesn't have luck with her marriage though.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH] Go through them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I guess good looks isn't everything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And then, let's see, I like Nicole Kidman movies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and, ah, she does -- I think she portray -- she can portray so many characters so well --
L:  Yeah, yes she does.
R:  -- and, ah, I guess, ah, [inaudible] that leads me to think of Top Gun, I really liked that one.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  With, ah, Tom Cruise in it.
L:  Tom Cruise, yeah.
R:  But I think I like his earlier movies better than I do his later ones.  Isn't that interesting?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think I do too, but I really liked him in the Mission Impossible.
R:  Yes, he did -- we've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- got that one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that was -- I think there's two Mission Imposs- --
L:  There's two, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm. --
