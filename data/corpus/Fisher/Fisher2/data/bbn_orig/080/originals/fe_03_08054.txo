L:  Hello, my name is Becky.
R:  Hi, my name's Gina.
L:  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  How are you?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I'm doing fine.  I actually don't play computer games though.  [LAUGH]  My ...
R:  Uh, well, I do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you?
R:  Yes.  Um, well --
L:  My husband plays them all the time.
R:  -- do you play board games?
L:  Yeah.  I do.  I do play board games.  But my husband plays computer games all the time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Like what?
L:  Um, he likes that civilization game and ...
R:  Well, see, I play that.
L:  Oh.
R:  I suck at it, but I play it.
L:  [LAUGH] What kinda games --
R:  Yeah.  I like --
L:  -- do you like?
R:  -- die all the time.  I like games like that.  Games where you don't die quickly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I don't really do one person shooter games because well, I -- I suck at them.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, there's one game I play where you kill people and it's [inaudible] and the reason why is because it's so simple, like a two year old could do it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I can actually advance, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's always nice.
R:  And I play like the Sims.  Have you ever heard of that?
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's the only computer game I play.  [LAUGH]  I love the ...
R:  See, and I play that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I love that because I can download new stuff for them and I can tell 'em what to do and when I get bored of it, like I can go away for like two months and then when I play it again --
L:  It's fun again.
R:  -- it's so easy to just slip back in and ...
L:  Oh, totally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely.
R:  To do everything and ...
L:  So, what kinda Sims, um, uh, extension packs do you have?
R:  Oh, I have, uh, almost all of them except for house party and that new one that they came out with.  I have like the pets.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  I have the pets unleashed.  I have, uh, living large.  I have [NOISE], uh, the -- the hot date --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  -- which screws up everybody's system.
L:  Does it really?
R:  I don't know what they did with that one.  But, yeah, hot date for some reason when you put it on your computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, it's really neat.  It adds neat stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it -- it screws up everybody's computer system.
L:  Uh, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I only have just the regular and then the, uh -- or the pet one, you know?
R:  The pet one.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's cute, but kinda useless 'cause once you get 'em then you have to like actually take care of 'em and I so don't have the patience for that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like every time I seem to have a baby I'm like [MN] just -- just kill the thing, okay --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they are so annoying.
L:  Yeah.  I have a friend that actually plays and -- and -- and she sees how many ways she can kill them.  I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's like her general pastime.
R:  I have done all of them.  I have drowned them.  I have, um, locked them in a room except for I really didn't like -- I don't like the slow deaths because then they cry at you like all the time and you start feeling kinda guilty 'cause they --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- get all pathetic on you and you're like oh, and -- and yeah --
L:  That's terrible.
R:  -- and I don't like that.  But I like the burning death 'cause then they dance around and you're like ha, ha.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- yeah, I've done a lotta them.  I actually, um, found a little thing on the Internet that made my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- burglar shoot my Sim.
L:  Really?
R:  That was really neat.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  Interesting. 
R:  -- like it only worked once.  I have never been able to duplicate it, like -- and -- and you have to like press special buttons when you do it, like control and shift and enter and then it's supposed to work again and it never has.
L:  Weird.
R:  Yeah.  I was like crap.  That was so cool.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and now my burglar's just a reg- stupid old burglar again.
L:  That sucks.
R:  But I have a pimp house --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I have a winter wonderland house 'cause I love Christmas, it's my favorite holiday.
L:  Uh-huh.  Cool.
R:  And I have an animal house and a log cabin.  But I have like so many downloads for it it's not even funny.  So ...
L:  See, that's my -- I -- I don't end up usually playing that long because my husband plays with the computer and then reformats the hard drive and erases everything and, you know, so I don't get too attached.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, see, I could not deal with that.  We -- my boyfriend builds computers.  Thank God.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, he has his own little room where he has his own little computers and then I have my own computer and when he touches mine it's only because I have a problem and I need it fixed --
L:  [LAUGH] There you go.
R:  -- otherwise I'm like get away, don't touch it, don't look at it, don't even think about it.
L:  That's cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  See, so I couldn't have that.
L:  Right on.
R:  [LAUGH] But ...  [NOISE]
L:  So, where do you -- where do you live?
R:  Huh?
L:  Are you -- I said where do you live?  Are you in the east coast or the west coast?
R:  I live in Louisiana.  Where do you live?
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Oregon.
R:  Oregon?
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, this is the first time I've actually talked to someone in state.  The last times were all like Canada.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never actually talked to anybody in Canada.  [LAUGH]
R:  And you know what's goofy?  The first question they asked to both of us, they asked me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and a guy from Canada what do I think about the public schools in the United States?  The guy's like --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- I have no idea.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I live in Canada.
L:  The guy shouldn't have accepted the -- he probably shouldn't have accepted the call then.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like what the heck!
L:  That's odd.
R:  Well, they must not have explained it well enough because like this one they don't explain it.  They just said the call is about computer games.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  The probably just said the call is about public schools and then he was like oh, well, okay.
L:  Oh, that could be.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, nah, I live here and -- and I don't know.
L:  See, I'm all ...
R:  I like this little program though.  It's fun.
L:  Yeah.  It's cool.  Have you been on a lotta calls or just a couple of 'em?
R:  This is my third because I --
L:  Yeah.  This is my third.
R:  -- work all the time.
L:  Yeah.  That sounds like me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  This is my first girl though.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, you're special.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Haven't had a girl before.
L:  You what?
R:  I said I haven't had a girl before on --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- on one of the calls.  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's cool.  I figured computer games I'll probably get some -- some geeky guy, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm geeky, just not a guy.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  In fact I'm sitting here -- right here reading Harry Potter.
L:  Hey, that's cool.  I haven't read any of those.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  But he ...
R:  They're so good.
L:  I -- I watched the movie.  So, that's good enough for me.  A book could take me ...
R:  See, the movies just don't provide you with enough background.
L:  Ah.  It usually takes me like a year to read a book.  So, I usually just have my husband --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- read 'em and then just tell me about 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Cheat!
L:  I'm too lazy.  [LAUGH]
R:  See, I'm a speed reader.  So, I don't have that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I'm always reading.  I'm a bookworm.
L:  Right on.  Well, that's cool.  So, do you play any of your computer games on the Internet?
R:  Yeah.  I play, um [LIPSMACK] -- Yahoo have some neat games and I play those, um -- I like playing pool on the Internet 'cause it's pretty neat 'cause you can chat while ya play --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then whoever you're playing against you can like, you know, kid around with and say, you know, you suck, you have lost to the demon goddess.  [LAUGH]  You know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just goofy stuff and --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- I don't play cards though 'cause well, I suck at 'em.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know what I'm good at and I tend to play those things because well, you can only lose so many times and still like the game.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Nobody wants to lose.
R:  And like I have Creatures.  Have you ever played Creatures?
L:  Uh-uh.  No.
R:  It's so -- it's so cute.  It's this old computer game about these little like fuzzy alien creatures --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they hatch from an egg and you literally raise them --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and you teach them how to speak and how to think and they can learn on their own, but you have to teach them so that they can go on.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  But I haven't played it a lot since I drowned my first one, not on purpose, but like --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- he accidentally drowned and I cried 'cause I'd gotten so attached to this little being 'cause he was so cute and I taught him all this stuff --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then he goes and he drowns himself and I'm like oh, what the hell!
L:  That's terrible.  [LAUGH]
R:  It was terrible.
L:  Poor thing.
R:  And like when he drowned he cried like a little baby and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you're just like oh, my God!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's horrible.
L:  No.  It is.
R:  But I like that game.  It's really -- but it's a fun game.  I mean --
L:  Well, that's cool.
R:  -- you know, before he drowned.  My boyfriend's sitting here laughing at me.  [LAUGH]  Shut up!
L:  [LAUGH] Hey, it's all good.
R:  He hasn't played it.  He doesn't understand.  He's just a big old dumb guy.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He plays computer games too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But he doesn't play them very long because he plays the ones where you don't have to, um, think, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  He's like if -- if ya have to think about it it's not a game.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I understand that.
R:  Yeah.  And so he plays like Need for Speed, like the racing games and stuff like that.  He doesn't play anything where you have to think.  Like Sims he doesn't get that at all.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, really?
R:  He thinks it's boring.  Yeah.  Civilization ...
L:  You know, I -- I -- I got that on the Playstation also.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the Sims game.
R:  Oh, see, I have, um, Sim City --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on Super Nintendo, but I don't own a Playstation because anything after Super Nintendo they just have way too many buttons on the controllers.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They do.  They have like eighteen buttons and I'm like oh, and then when I'm getting into the thick of the game and I really need to like, you know, hit somebody or kill somebody I forget which button to press.
L:  I can understand that one.  It happens to me all the time.
R:  And I like roll instead of, you know, jump.
L:  Yeah.  That happens.  [LAUGH]
R:  And that annoys me 'cause my older brothers have everything that came out.  I have four little brothers and they have all of it.  They have --
