L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Tony.
R:  My name's Lynette.
L:  Hi, how are you doing, tonight?
R:  I'm fine.  And you?
L:  Oh, not too bad.
R:  Good.
L:  Okay.  Video g- -- ah, actually computer games.
R:  Computer games.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  There's so many good ones out there.  How can you, you know, really pick, ah, the best one?
R:  Well, unfortunately --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I don't know too many of 'em [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, unfortunately, I don't have too many of them.  Um --
R:  Oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I don't really play online, because I have a dial up, and that just doesn't work real well.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, they'll -- the -- really, the only way to do it -- I mean, you can do it with a dial up, but the dial up we have is such a bad connection.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it just goes so slow.  There's just -- takes bloody forever, so it's -- I don't -- don't even bother playing online games.
R:  I have only done it on, um --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  I've only really played like --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- more like the, um, [LIPSMACK] -- gosh, the checkers, and -- and that sort of thing.
L:  Oh, the old ones?
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay.  You don't play the new -- the ones that have all the graphics and everything else, huh?
R:  No, I don't know anything --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- about 'em.  I tried to -- to do some of them, and I just don't know what's going on.  So --
L:  Actually, I have to say, the -- the best one I have actually played with my son i- is Motorcycle Madness.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, and you can actually play that one with a joystick.
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  Yeah, it -- it -- he has blast, playing that.  Ah --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you know, you -- you can just go through different scenarios.  You can do off road, you can do, um, like, a super cross type of thing.
R:  Ah.
L:  And you can play it through stages, so, you know, you have to be X amount of games, or actually X amount of races, and then you can go on to the next level.  And then to the next level.
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  It's actually a lot of fun.
R:  That is -- ah, well my son's only, like, twenty months old, so --
L:  Ah, well, I guess he doesn't play them, yet, does he?
R:  I'm sure my day is coming --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- when he's gonna be into all of that.
L:  Well, motor -- i- if he does get into playing video games on the computer, um, my wife has a whole list of 'em for -- for kids, actually.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and he loves playing video games.  And he actually started playing games -- oh boy, um, she actually started -- actually, she started both of our kids out very early --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- playing games.  And they were -- a lot of 'em were the, um, [LIPSMACK] -- oh, let's see, here, some of the, ah, not the Disney one, but, ah, which one, which one, which one?  It's like, a Fisher Price one, I think, is what it is.
R:  Oh.
L:  Or, ah, Jumpstart Toddlers.
R:  Mhm.  I've heard of that.
L:  And those are really good.  Um, we've got a couple of those and they both had a lot of fun with those.
R:  It's amazing what they've done, you know, over the past several years, with computer games.  I mean --
L:  Oh, it's just -- you -- you wouldn't believe it.
R:  [NOISE] Just --
L:  I mean, just w- with kid -- kid games, alone, have gotten so much better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and then, you know, you factor in what they've done with adult games.  You just -- some of the stuff just blows you away.
R:  It looks so real.  Some of it just looks so real, it's -- it's amazing.  I have played some of the, um, the word games [NOISE].  And it --
L:  Like which ones?
R:  I can't think of any of the names of 'em, but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, some of the ones where, um, you'll have to find what -- it's almost like a -- a, um, [LIPSMACK] -- not a jumble, but --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- you've got a -- a block full of letters, and you've got to find words within the -- the block, and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, those sorts of things.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- probably because of the -- the dial up, because I am on dial up -- and it's, you know, waiting for anything else to -- to open up has just been ridiculous.  So I go to whatever's quickest [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  And kinda play those.  But, um --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- I just haven't -- haven't really seen a whole lot of 'em.
L:  Well, y- y- you can actually, um -- [LIPSMACK] a lot of the old video games --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like Tetris and Pacman, ah, Galaxia, Missile Command, all the -- all the old -- some of the old Atari games, a lot of the old a- -- ah, arcade games --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can get on CD rom.
R:  Did not know that.
L:  Yes.  Ah, the only bad thing is, about doing that, is sometimes the games don't work as well as they should.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, or sometimes they don't even work at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you can -- you can buy discs that have like, [NOISE] oh, like -- I think they've got one that has like, two hundred video games on it.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they're act- -- and there's -- there's a lot of cool ones on there.  Um, Joust, Missile Command, Centipede, um --
R:  From our time?  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's --
R:  And those are --
L:  It's definitely, ah, old -- older [LAUGH].
R:  I wonder if the -- are the graphics --
L:  The graphics are --
R:  -- m- -- new and improved?
L:  -- just like they used to be.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  No.  Nope.  Just as -- just as, ah, they were when they first made 'em.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  I mean, I'm -- [LIPSMACK] I'll be thirty this year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean, you know, I've -- I've played a lot of the old Atari games and a lot of the old video games.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so when I was growing up, they were actually improving them, even then.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I never really quit playing video games.  Doing a lot less, now.  But, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it -- it's just amazing to see the improvements that they've made, just from, you know, ten years ago, or -- or twelve years ago.
R:  Oh, it's -- it's --
L:  It's just unreal.
R:  -- just light speed.  I mean, just to see some of the commercials for, you know, the Playstation, and all of that stuff.  I mean, you have to look twice to see if it's real or not.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  It's just amazing that --
L:  Um, I've got a, ah, Playstation one that we got so that we could get games for my son to play.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I -- I have actually rented the, ah, Playstation two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] and played the Spiderman game -- [inaudible] and I, 'cause he loves [NOISE] the movie.
R:  Wow.
L:  And it's -- it's unreal how real it is.  I mean, he was -- he changed, 'cause on the -- on the first one it's obviously a video game.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But on the second one, some of the things are so real, and how [NOISE] -- how things actually resemble the movie so much --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  That he actually started being a little fart, and trying to do some of the stuff in the game.  I think, no.
R:  Ah.
L:  We don't do that.
R:  [LAUGH] It's not real.
L:  No.
R:  It's a game [LAUGH].
L:  It's a game.  We don't actually kick Daddy in the face --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  That's bad.
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  We don't jump off the couch onto Daddy.  You know --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- because I'm not a bad guy, you're not Spiderman [LAUGH].
R:  There's some really bad games out there, though.  I'm sure you've really got to [NOISE] really watch what you're, you know, letting your kids play.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Um, I've got -- I've actually got one computer game.  It's called Karmageddon.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you can actually run over people and watch them splatter across the screen [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my goodness.  That is wild.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it -- it's a fun game.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, but I had to play the --
R:  Until that happens [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I -- well, I had to play it in the mode where I couldn't run the people over.
R:  Right.
L:  Or, you know, when I tried to, they ran out the way, so that I didn't run them over.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Um, and then, you know, he -- he was getting way too into that, so I played another one called Driver.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which you're -- you know, you play an undercover cop.  You can pick different cars, and --
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and go through, ah, different scenarios and, with this one, you can't run over, um, any pedestrians, because they all run out of the way [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, you know, you get to crash into the other car, and --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and run into oncoming traffic, and, you know -- all the fun stuff you can do in a video game, where just nobody gets hurt.
R:  Right.  And as long as, you know, the kids realize that it's -- that's not real, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't turn sixteen and get a driver's licence and think you can --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- run over people.
L:  You're gonna find, the hard way, that it doesn't work as well as you think [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  You don't bump off and keep going [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.  Your insurance goes up, and everything else.
L:  Uh-oh.  Yeah.
R:  That's so neat.  I guess, maybe, next time I get on the internet, I need to kinda check out some of the game sites, and see what's out there.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, shush, grumpy.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, you can actually get, ah, games like Tetris. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you've ever played that one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, my wife is addicted to that.
R:  On the -- that's -- that's --
L:  I haven't, yet, bought it for the computer, 'cause I know she'll sit there in front of it -- if front of it for hours.
R:  That's probably why I haven't gone to those sites, is because [LAUGH] I know I'll learn a game, and get really [NOISE] -- really wanna play it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I downloaded one of the internet called Jewel.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's similar to Tetris, but what you have to do is you have to match the, ah, gems [NOISE]. 
R:  [LIPSMACK].
L:  You know, you have to match the, like, three in a row of -- of the gems.
R:  Oh.
L:  And the way it works is -- like with Tetris, once you get a block, it -- just that block goes away?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and then, you know, if it falls down to a certain level, then, you know, the -- another block will go.  Well, on Jewel, it's -- it's similar to that.  You -- you get one block going, then -- then it'll, as it drops down you can clear out more and more blocks on one shot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you get bonus points and everything else.  And that was a pretty fun one.
R:  Oh, that does sound like something I would -- [LAUGH] 'cause I like Tetris, too.  So I would probably --
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's actually a pretty fun game.  Um --
R:  I just haven't really -- I'm gonna have to make a -- an effort to go check those out.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So I'm not so out of the loop when my child gets to that age.
L:  I mean, actually, I mean, that's the one -- I mean, my wife, um, she never -- she g- -- she likes the older video games.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The old style video games.  And -- and --
R:  With Pacman, and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  Oh, she loves that kind of stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And with me, you know, it's okay, but, you know, I wanna [NOISE] see the new stuff, because one of us has to be up to speed on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what the games are.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and she's not a huge video game fan, but I just love 'em.  I mean, I -- you know, if I could go to the arcade every day, I would.  But --
R:  That's so funny.  Now, I used to do the whole, you know, Donkey Kong, and then Mario Brothers and --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- and those [LAUGH], back in the day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But now, I mean, I -- I guess a lot of 'em, though -- it almost seems like a lot of them are geared toward the male audience.
L:  Oh, most definitely.
R:  You know, with the cars and the motorcycles, and -- 'cause that's just not something that most women really get into.  Most women aren't into the guns and, you know, all of that stuff, but --
L:  No, I -- I know my wife never was.
R:  To -- so, I mean, even growing up, you know, I might -- I might play -- I wasn't even real big into Space Invaders, you know?
L:  [NOISE].
R:  That sort of thing.  I liked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the more animated --
