L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my is name is Roseanne.  I live in New Jersey.
L:  Oh, my name is Justin and I live in Boston.
R:  Boston?  Well, this is really strange but, um, I've never done this before, but I heard that the topic is about movies.
L:  Yeah.  That sounds about right.
R:  And, um, I -- I really love movies, I really do.  That's why I decided to, um, do it today and, um, I have -- I've rented a tremendous amount of movies.  I -- I like renting them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- better than actually -- actually, I like the big screen, but the thing is, I don't like to wait on lines and I don't wanna wait for popcorn and I -- I don't wanna fight over a seat, I just like, you know, after a hard day's work, just sitting down, picking a good movie and watching it.
L:  Yeah, that makes sense.  My -- I personally prefer renting as well, but more because going to the movie cost, like, twenty dollars by the time you buy pop- popcorn or anything, it's, like, thirty dollars and most places won't allow you to bring your own food, so I like the comforts of my own home, personally.
R:  I -- it -- it is pretty good, and you can stop the fil- -- uh, the movie any time you want [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's a good point.
R:  -- if you have to get up to do something or, you know, somebody comes to the door, you can always stop and rewind it or -- or you could even watch it again if you missed a part --
L:  That's --
R:  -- so that's pretty good.
L:  -- that's true.  How about DVDs versus VHS?
R:  You know what?  I like the DVDs but for some reason, I don't know why, I -- I get -- I just feel like I get dizzy watching them.  I -- I don't know why, but, um, [LIPSMACK] I like the old fashioned [LAUGH] VHS --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- movies the best.  Um, I don't know, we have a DVD player, but I -- I don't use it that often.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I kind of -- I don't know, maybe because it's more tech than the old fashioned type that I'm used to using, but I don't even know how to use the machine that well. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that makes sense.  I -- I only have VHS, s- so I haven't really experienced the DVDs too much, but --
R:  Uh-huh.  What kind of movies do you like?  Action, adventure, drama, comedies, a- -- uh, horror movies?
L:  Uh, my favorite would be, like, psychological thrillers.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- big fan of, like, Silence of the Lambs or, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it, uh, Seven, that's a good movie.
R:  I remember that.
L:  U- um, I think the movie was called Twelve Monkeys or something like that.
R:  No, I missed that one.  I should really -- I heard of that before but I missed that, um [LIPSMACK] I like the -- I guess Michelle Pfeiffer movies, they're kind of psychological m- -- you know?
L:  Oh, yeah, often times a lot of hers are, um --
R:  I -- I like them too.  I mean, I like movies that keep you in suspense, that you don't feel like getting up for any minute, you don't wanna miss any m- -- um, [LIPSMACK] I like dramas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And comedies are hard, because they really have to be funny --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  Like, I -- there's certain actors that, you know, that are really funny, like I like Bette Midler a lot, like her old flicks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, I think they're pretty funny.  But, um, there's a -- a -- there is -- comedy's hard because it -- what might be funny to one person isn't to another.
L:  Yeah, I would -- I would tend to agree there.  I -- I kind of -- I mean, there's a mood for me when I need -- when I need to watch a comedy as opposed to anything else but, uh, for the most part I -- I enjoy s- something that has more of a plot, something that you have to pay more attention to and kind of follow and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  Did you see the Ring?
L:  The Ring?
R:  Right.
L:  No, I've not seen that one yet.
R:  Oh, you ha- -- 'cause it's on -- you -- it's in Blockbuster now and I -- I wanted to ask you what you thought of it, but you didn't see it yet. [LAUGH]
L:  No, not yet.
R:  Oh, I mean, it -- there's the ending kinda, you know, makes you wonder.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] the last movie I saw, I have a daughter I adopted --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she's three and she had never been to the big screen before, so I took her to see Finding Nemo.
L:  Oh, I've heard a lot of good things about it.
R:  You know, and I seen a lot of adults in the movie too, because it's, um, uh, you know, the special effects are phenomenal, and the coloring, there's a lot of different colors going around, i- it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's really adorable.  It's well done.  I thought it was -- it's a Disney flick and, um --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- I -- I thought it was pretty cute, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Of course, she didn't stay awake for the whole thing, she watched about the first hour and then after that she was, like, oh, kind of passed out but, um, it was -- it was fun.  It was fun and it was colorful and, you know, I -- sometimes I thought the jokes were over her head --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, for a little tot.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  But, um, you know, I thought it was great.  It was sort of like Shrek, you know?  Like Sh- -- did you like Shrek?  Did you see --
L:  Actually, [LAUGH] I haven't seen that one.  It -- it -- to be honest with you, I -- my movie watching is limited --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- um, especially o- on the big screen, I don't go too often, um --
R:  Are you a student?
L:  Well, I am applying to go for an MBA s- -- for, um, but, um, [LIPSMACK] my girlfriend and I, for the most part we enjoy even sitting in a cafe or, you know, more than -- than sitting on a couch.
R:  You say you're in the Boston area?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Which part of New Jersey are you in?
R:  Um, near Giant Stadium.
L:  Oh, so, northern Jersey?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.
R:  Have you been here?
L:  What's that?
R:  Have you ever been here?
L:  Um, I actually lived in New Jersey for a year when I was about one years old and a- -- most of my relatives are in southern Jersey.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  So, what's your --
R:  -- yeah, I could understand that, 'cause the movie -- a movie is, like, an hour and a half, and you really have to dedicate yourself to it, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I like -- myself, I like some of the, um, talk shows.  I watch them because you can, like, even if you run out of the room for a minute, you're not losing too much of what's being said.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, you know, you really have to have an hour and half to yourself to sit and concentrate, 'cause certain movies -- I mean, certain movies you could walk out of and come back and it's the same stuff going on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but there's other ones that you really, really have to -- you can't miss too much because then you miss the whole ending --
L:  So, w- --
R:  -- but, um, there's some classics out there that everybody has seen, like Fatal Attraction.  I guess everybody's -- have -- you must have seen that, right?
L:  Yeah, I've seen that.
R:  Yeah, it's kinda --
L:  What's your favorite movie of all time?
R:  You're not going to believe this --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I love Jeff Bridges and I kinda like Starman.  Did you ever see that?
L:  What was it again?
R:  Starman.
L:  Starman?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've -- I -- I actually have never heard of it.
R:  Um, yeah, [LAUGH] well, it's an old flick, it's got Jeff Bridges in it and it's about, um, it's sort of like a science fiction movie where, uh, DNA -- he repr- repr- -- takes a piece of hair --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from this -- this woman's boyfriend and reproduces himself according to his DNA and becomes that person.
L:  Oh.
R:  But he's really an alien and that --
L:  That's interesting.
R:  Yeah, it is, it's pretty interesting.  You gotta -- I guess you gotta see it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, there's a lot of them.  I -- I mean, there's some that I'm just, like, glued to the TV, 'cause I don't wanna miss a thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there's others that I -- within the first five minutes you're, like, "Oh, I wish -- why did I rent this?  I'm bringing this back to Blockbuster" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah.  Well, my favorite movie is another man movie, Rainman.
R:  Rainman?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
R:  Is that with Al Pacino?
L:  Uh, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise.
R:  Okay, okay, okay, okay, and he's autistic?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, yeah, those two together work very well.
L:  It's [MN] -- it's been one of my favorite movies, just 'cause it has a lot of quotable lines in it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, and I usually can't remember quotes very well but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's the one movie where, for some reason, I -- I've remembered quite a few of the -- of the quotes, and they're very applicable, like -- just, like, my sister's learning how to drive, and one of the quotes is, "I'm a very good driver.  My Dad lets me practice in the driveway".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I -- I always t- tease her about that and say that to her.
R:  Yeah, that's -- I tell you, some of the best quotes come from movies, and the lines, you know?
L:  Oh, of course.  People, uh, like some of the Monty Python movies --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you hear people going back and forth for hours just quoting back and forth those -- those lines.  It's very, uh, you're very right there.
R:  Did you hear Katherine Hepburn died today?
L:  Yeah, at ninety six, though.
R:  God bless her.
L:  Jeeze.  That's, uh, [MN] a very long, full life.
R:  [MN] Ninety six, oh my God, and she was -- she was pretty with it, I think, even in her nineties --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know?
L:  It seemed like it.  Yeah.  But, uh --
R:  No, but I like movies, I like TV shows and all that kind of stuff, right?  And, uh, I -- you know, there came a time in my life where I could watch two or three movies in a row, one after the other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I guess it's 'cause -- well, I worked in advertising for so long that I used to really get into the commercials and we used to write commercials and all that but I -- I could -- I could actually sit and watch c- -- um, television shows for a long time, especially if there's really good actors or if the movie was very good, you know?  I -- I -- I -- you know, like, if I missed something, I -- you know, when the VCRs first came out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and a- -- y- you got an opportunity to see all the movies that you missed on the screen, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
R:  That was a great opportunity to, you know, make sure that you saw these old flicks that everybody used to talk about that if you missed --
