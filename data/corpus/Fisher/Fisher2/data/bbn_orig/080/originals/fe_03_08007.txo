R:  Hi.
L:  Hello, hello.  My name is Jean.
R:  Mm, my name is Malini[?].
L:  Malini, what a pretty name.
R:  Oh, thank you.
L:  And we're to talk about movies.
R:  Yes.  We'll talk about movies and I guess, if we li-  -- and if we would rather rent them or, ah, ah, have them on --
L:  Or go to the movie theater.  I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hope that you see more movies than I do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you [LAUGH] -- I -- I -- I really don't.  Oh, I mean, actually, I suppose maybe, ah, oh, we, ah, rent a movie maybe once a week, um.
L:  Oh, do you?  Oh, good.
R:  I- is that a lot?
L:  [MN] I think that's wonderful.  I just never seem to get sat down in front of the -- the TV long enough to, um, watch one.  My husband is a really big movie person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, in fact, he just, ah, which I didn't even know about, several weeks ago went out and bought a DVD player because he said everything at Blockbuster is gonna be DVDs.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, I thought -- I didn't even know we were doing Blockbuster.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I think things are really changing.  We were just, ah, in fact, this morning, going through the movies my daughter has t- to try to sell the ones that she has on, ah, the VHS --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- because I think everything will be DVD now.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and how were you going to go about selling them, li- like on Ebay?  Do you do that?
R:  Well, ah, ah, ah, yeah.  Well, we might do it on Ebay but I think I -- I, um, Am- um, Amazon -- ah, Amazon dot com, um --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, you know, we're going to do s- several, or --  you know, we -- we live in a pretty small community, so we can just put a sign up at the local, ah, store, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- saying we've got movies for children and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think, there's a lot of people with children around.
L:  Right, that's a good idea, that's a good idea.  I don't even know what we have, I know we do have a few, um, I actually even bought The Lion King about a year ago and haven't even watched it.
R:  Oh, you bought The Lion King, yeah --
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, that's a good one, that's a --
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I had the opportunity to -- to buy it at a -- at a good price and, actually we had seen the musical of it, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, live, which is totally different from the movie, but so many friends going around singing songs from The Lion King and I thought [LIPSMACK] "You know, I've just got to see this" --
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  -- and -- and I haven't yet --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- but, ah, um --
R:  Well, it sounds like you're really active.
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm busy --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, now, where do you live?
R:  Ah, in California.
L:  Oh, you do?  What part?
R:  Yeah, ah, Carmel Valley.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  Ah, yeah.  How about you?  Where do you live?
L:  Oh, I'm in Houston, Texas.
R:  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Actually, really a small 'burb just over the city, um, line from Houston --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to the west, called Katy.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, where it's hot, but --
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  we certainly have a lot of movie theaters and, ooh, I think we're supposed to get to the last movie we saw, ah --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that was a suggestion and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- do you know, I can't even remember the name of it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I used, and it's not true, but I -- I would joke with my younger friends that the last movie we saw was The Muppet Movie, um, but that isn't really true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The last movie we saw in the theater, and it's not that long ago, um, was a Jack Nicholson movie and I can't even remember the name of it, as I said.
R:  Ah, oh, I know -- I know, About Schmidt?
L:  It wasn't About Schmidt.  Isn't there another one?
R:  Oh no, I don't know if there's ano- -- that could --
L:  Maybe it is About Schmidt.
R:  -- is he -- with Jack Nicholson, when he was an older -- older guy and his wife died and -- do you remember?
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] I don't even remember.  I didn't even particularly like it and I like Jack Nicholson, um, there -- there was a comedian in it that kind of played himself and wh- whom I didn't know, but afterwards someone said, "Oh, you know, he was just really playing himself and he gets so, kind of, dirty" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and the whole thing was just tiresome, it's -- it's probably been out a couple of months now, I think it's since About Schmidt, I don't think --
R:  Oh, maybe it's a really new one, I don't know.  About Schmidt's been out for a while, yeah.
L:  Okay, yeah, 'cause it's been, you know, on -- on the airlines, um, it's -- it was on one flight that we took --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, I didn't even watch it then, I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- have -- chose to read.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, well, what types of movies do you all like to rent?
R:  Well, um, ah, eee, ooh, ooh, oh, we like a, um, a lot of different kinds.  I like the -- the -- I liked that Jack Nicholson one.  Probably that was the last one, About Schmidt.  We saw that at a movie theater but, ah, last night actually we saw The Hours, i- it was a movie about Virginia Woolf --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  and, um, oh, that was that [inaudible] --
L:  That would be interesting.
R:  -- very, very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it was, um, I think it had Meryl Streep in it and Nicole Kidman and -- and, um, it was -- it had, like, i- it's three different women sort of acting out parts in Mrs. Dalloway, w- --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- ah, i- in some ways, you know, but it was -- even if it was a, ah, ah, you know, a lot of things about suicide and, um, so -- so in that way it wasn't a -- it wasn't a comedy by any -- by --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- but, um -- but it was very, very well done.
L:  Well, good.  Well, Meryl Streep is always good.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Meryl Streep is always good.  Then of course, Virginia Woolf and -- and Mrs. Dalloway, you know, the whole --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I mean, the topic is certainly -- and -- and I -- I was -- I had wondered how they would do it, um, but -- but it came off very, very well.
L:  Well, good, good.  Well, we'll have to keep an eye open for that.  The one I wanted to see, when we actually went to the movie theater to see the Jack Nicholson was The Pianist.
R:  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Did you see that?
R:  Well, no, actually my, um, um -- I fell asleep.  My husband rented it and I fell asleep on that one --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] he thought it was very good though, I --
L:  Well, that's what I've heard, but I couldn't get my husband interested in it so --
R:  In that one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that one -- yeah, no, I heard -- yeah, he said that was very, very good and, um, yeah, I would have, you know, I -- w- we have a -- a young child and sometimes I still fall asleep early --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- after [LAUGH] had -- had a, ah -- so I -- so I think it -- it -- it sounds like, do you guys prefer to rent movies versus --
L:  Well, that's what he has been doing but my husband is retired, I still work --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think it's some of his amusement during the day --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and I've often said to the kids, he really shouldn't be left alone because he does all these things, I mean, I didn't know we had a DVD player 'til --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- a month after he bought it and I'm going --
R:  But they're not very expensive i- -- yeah.
L:  No, I know, it didn't matter, but I'm going, "Well, you know, we don't -- why do we need it, we don't watch movies?"  And he said, "Well, I've been getting some at Blockbuster". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't know that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you've got to do something [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's right [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, no, but I -- I know -- I know what you mean, I think -- I think sometimes, I know when my dad was older, he -- he watched TV a lot more than made me comfortable, but I think as he couldn't get around very much any more and -- and he --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and so then, you know, it's -- it's hard for them.
L:  Well, he can get around just fine, he's just lazy --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he's just being very, very tired.  And, um, this morning, I see -- he has his own space and when we downsized, um, oh gosh, about eight or nine years ago, and, um, [LIPSMACK] I said, ah, "The TV will not be in the great room", 'cause we just have one living area --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so it's in, um, his, kind of, office space -- 
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and so I don't know what's going on in there --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, um, I went looking for him this morning and, um, he -- he actually had the TV on, said he was watching a movie, he was reading a book and he was playing a game on the computer --
R:  At the same time.
L:  -- and I said, "You know, this -- this is ridiculous, I don't know how you do this", but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, 'cause he's not a multi task person --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, like a mother is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, he said, "Oh, they're playing Audrey Hepburn movies this morning", I said, " Well that sounds great", but yeah, I just can't sit down and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and watch Audrey Hepburn movies --
R:  Not in the middle of the day.
L:  -- as much as I'd love to.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, now I think i- i- -- you know, I -- I liked -- I think like Saturday night is -- is, you know, I like to sit down and watch a movie --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, 'cause otherwise, you know, my tendency would be to work nine hundred hours a week but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but -- you know, I -- I -- you -- you know you can't do that and -- and --
L:  No, that's right.
R:  -- yeah, and so, you know, then it's good and it's no -- I -- I enjoy it, yeah, we --
L:  Well, I really should be more -- more tuned in but, you know, ah, when he mentioned the Audrey Hepburn, you know, there's so many good old movies --
R:  No -- oh.
L:  -- that are just such a joy.
R:  Oh, the, ah, yeah, yeah.  In fact I -- at the -- at the store the other day, just when we were getting this one I saw all kinds of old Alfred Hitchcock that I hadn't seen --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- out on DVD now and so I want to go back and get those, because I really enjoy those.
L:  Um, yeah, those are good.  I mean, they're -- the -- the -- the actors are, you know, so wonderful and -- and they're wholesome, I mean, you don't have to worry about, ah, the things that you have to be concerned about now in having movies around with -- especially with young children.
R:  Oh, yeah, no, I know, but even, ah, in fact, I know even when the Disney ones, I know, when my little one was really little, she -- the -- the big fire in Bambi, I mean, and then --
