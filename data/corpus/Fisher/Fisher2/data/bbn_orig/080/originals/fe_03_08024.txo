R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  I'm, uh, Jack from, uh, W- West Palm Beach, Florida
R:  My name is Sarah.  I'm in Rockville, Maryland.
L:  Rockville, Maryland? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  As far as playing on, uh, computer games --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- no, I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- play on any computer games.  I, uh, used to play on 'em and I used -- used to try to when I first got my first computer, but the computer locked up, so I never went back to play the games.  I use it mainly to just -- to, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, look up information and email et cetera.
R:  I also don't have time for [LAUGH] video games.  I wish I did.  My kids like to play games on the computer and I watch them, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't have time to play with it myself. [LAUGH]
L:  It's the same thing w- with me, um --
R:  I wish I did.  They look fun. [LAUGH]
L:  -- my -- when the children were young, that's all they wanted to do is play games on the computer, and I still think even my son, to this day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, though he's very well versed in computer language and very well versed in the computer and he uses it for his business, every once in a while, he does play some computer games.  And they're usually a high [inaudible] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- type of game, not all these type of, uh, violent type situations, shooting and everything else, but they're more games --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that are involved --
R:  Right.
L:  -- intelligence and, uh, words and numbers and everything, since he --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- was a math major.  But your children are -- are s- --
R:  Right.
L:  -- still using the games, right? [COUGH] How old are they?
R:  I have three little boys, so they don't do any violent games --
L:  Oh, sure, right, right.
R:  -- yet.  They're seven, four and two and they all love the computer.
L:  Right.
R:  We +mainly -- ma- -- mostly do educational things --
L:  And that's a good idea too.  The only thing I use it for is -- 
R:  -- right now. [LAUGH]
L:  -- every once in a while actually we might have some --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- medical situation where we wanted to get [inaudible] use google or some of their sort of -- of, uh, you know, getting information and, uh, look up all the information we can find, and we use it for, let's say if we're buying a new car, to see what the value of a new car is, what the value of a used car is, what the trade in value is, or if we need some --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- information on anything in any particular subject -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- whether it's to do with our garden, whether it's to do with, uh, art, whether it's to do -- anything to do with our homes or anything. [MN] Right, even when my son was about to buy a --
R:  Right, we also use it a lot, but not much for games. [LAUGH]
L:  -- buy a house, we went and got a three D view of a house that he was about to buy, which, in a sense, is a game. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, it's amazing.
L:  Oh, me too, me too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I can't even remember what life was like before computers --
L:  And it's just the beginning, I guess, it's going to be fantastic in the future.
R:  -- it's been so long since we've used one.  I mean --
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's so incredible to --  I mean, even my two year old knows how to do everything on it, you know, it's ver- -- oh, yeah, turn it on, play the --
L:  I have a --
R:  -- games, do the mouse, and it's, like, he's so advanced [LAUGH] that's what he's growing up with, you know, that's what all the kids have.
L:  That's right, I have a granddaughter who's not quite three and she's sort of -- is getting little by little involved with the computer too.  Yeah, well, there was another thing, when we first got the computer, if we had any problems we just ask the kids how to help us out.
R:  Well, he has two big brothers who play so, you know, whatever they do, he can do, or thinks he can do, so [LAUGH] --
L:  'Cause they know more about it than we do.
R:  [LAUGH] It's true.  It's true.  I remember when my parents got our first computer --
L:  Oh, it's very frustrating, yeah.
R:  -- my Dad had no idea how to do it, he's reading the directions and we put it all together while he's, you know, sitting on the second page, looking at the book [LAUGH] and we knew it --
L:  There are times that I've written things on the computer and -- and pressed the wrong key and all of a sudden, I lost everything that I wrote.
R:  Oh, it is.
L:  And I didn't know how to save it, and I didn't know to get it back and everything else.  Yeah, it really is.
R:  Mhm, yeah.  Oh, yeah, it can be very frustrating.
L:  I do monitoring on the computer now --
R:  Or if you send an email to a person you didn't mean to send it to, you know, things like that. [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, I do monitoring of movies and have to write a report after I see a movie and send it in by nine o'clock in the morning, the next morning after I see the movie --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it just -- yeah, it is, it's just -- it gives you an idea of -- of who's seen the movie, um, or the -- the percentages of men --
R:  That sounds fun. [LAUGH]
L:  -- or men, the percentages of age groups, what the comments are --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, did people laugh at this point in the movie, did they laugh at that point in the movie, did they clap at the end of the movie --
R:  Right.
L:  -- did they make comments as they walked out of the movie, and then you write it up and it's sent in, uh --
R:  Right, sure.
L:  -- to report and they send it out to California to, uh, summarize everybody's report on the movies.
R:  A report, right.
L:  It really is.  Yeah.  Pays you to go to the movies, which is great.
R:  That sounds interesting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that sounds fun.  That sounds like a fun job, I would like that. [LAUGH]
L:  I can hear your children in the background now, too.
R:  Yeah, it's great.  It is great.
L:  So, you don't play, uh, computer games and I don't play computer games.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I've never --
R:  Yes, that's my two year old. [NOISE]
L:  Right, there's a --
R:  No, not at all, I wish I had time for that.
L:  -- there's a lot of things, by the way, for you to know, um, not a lot, but, uh, my son has these, um, uh, where you -- where you --
R:  You know, sometimes if my kids are playing, when they'll ask for help then I guess I could say that I'm playing, you know?  [inaudible] [NOISE] 
L:  -- can, um, uh, uh, play a particular cartoon and interact -- interacting type of things, yeah, and that's -- some of those are free --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that are on our computer, you just have to know where to get them, really.
R:  Really? [NOISE] That's interesting.
L:  Well, that -- there's -- there's a way of doing it, you have to -- I'm not sure how to do it --
R:  Really?
L:  -- I, uh, you -- you ask around.
R:  That's incredible.
L:  There's some, uh, uh, uh, places --
R:  My kids would like that, they love cartoons.
L:  -- on the internet, you can go in and there's no charge and you can actually see a cartoon or an animated story and you can stop it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and interact with it.  Yeah.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, that, uh --
R:  That's really cool, I would like to find that.  I'll have to look it up on google or something. [LAUGH]
L:  -- certain advertising agencies do that in certain areas, when they have previews of movies.
R:  I like the idea of getting paid to watch the movie, too.  I'll --
L:   Right.
R:  -- have to look for that. [LAUGH]
L:  The way you can find out is if -- if you ever see in the paper that they're going to have a preview of a movie and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get a free ticket, when you go -- if you get a free ticket and you go down there and find out who the agency was in charge --
R:  I'm sure that, you know, any area would need that, you know?
L:  -- that handled the movie and then contact the agency and tell them that you would like to get into monitoring --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- movies.
R:  Mhm.  Ah.
L:  Right.  Right, you see, there's always going to be somebody who's in charge of the thing.
R:  That's a good idea.  Well, I go to -- I try to go to a lot of sneak previews, just, you know, it's fun to see them early and -- but I've never thought of asking them that, that's a good idea.
L:  Uh, usually it's -- the agency is in charge because they're going to making a report or some monitor is going to be making a report.  He may be working for an agency, and you can ask him who the agency was --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and then get the name of the agency and the telephone number and call 'em up and tell them you're interested in monitoring, um, movies.  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  So, but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the, [SIGH] uh, I've -- I think I've monitored something like twenty five --
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  -- different movies in the last year.
R:  That's a very good idea.
L:  Yeah, that's a lot, I know.  And, uh, it's -- it's not -- it doesn't take much time, you see the movie, you come home, and you make up your report and you send it in by fax --
R:  Wow, that's a lot.
L:  -- or you send it in by the -- by email.
R:  That really is.
L:  And, uh, there's probably about, uh, for the -- for one movie, like, for instance, Terminator Three is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on tonight, and I'm going and doing that one now.  If Terminator Three and there'll --
R:  Right.
L:  -- probably be three hundred people around the country, but -- but doing it at the same time, and each person does his own report and then each person --
R:  Oh, really?  Are you doing that?
L:  -- sends it in --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to -- to, uh, the -- the s- --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to the agency, and the agency forwards it to the, uh, distributor out in California.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, these aren't computer games, but we don't play computer games, you don't play them and I don't play them. [LAUGH] So, it's something that's hard to talk about, something that we don't do.
R:  Sure.
L:  I think when I first got the computer, I had a game that was attached to it and I went into it --
R:  Right.  Right, neither of us do.
L:  -- and it locked up the computer --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and ever since then I was sort of frightened about going into games again.  Uh --
R:  That's funny.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I bet. [LAUGH] When something bad like that happens you don't wanna replicate what -- what you did to make it happen again.
L:  Yeah, I know, I know, it's hard to figure out what happens.
R:  I know the feeling. [LAUGH] My husband says that about, you know, when he's away I'll do --
L:  So, do you buy computer games or do you use computer games that are on your computer?
R:  -- something on the computer and something bad will happen, he'll say, "What were you doing?" you know, "Don't do that again" [LAUGH] and I have to say, "Oh, yeah --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- what did I do? [LAUGH] What did I do?"
L:  Right.
R:  But that's really interesting, I'm going to have to look that up next time.
L:  That's right.
R:  We -- w- we don't really have any on the computer, I buy a lot of them for the kids.
L:  Really?  I gotta let my son know that.
R:  But there's tons of websites that have free computer games.  I think my kids almost like those better than the ones that I spend money on.
L:  Right.
R:  Like they like to watch PBS, and PBS kids dot org has this huge website with tons and tons of kids games.
L:  W- w- what is this, uh, website on, that it's called?  PBS d- d- dot org?  I'm going to write that down so that I remember that.
R:  Yeah, because if your granddaughter likes the PBS shows, like Dragon Tales and --
L:  PBS kids dot org.
R:  -- all these -- oh, they have wonderful games and things you can print out, and my kids just wanna do that all the time.
L:  That's great to know.  I thank you very much for that.
R:  It's PBS kids dot org.
L:  So --
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, you do that too?
R:  Mhm, and they have wonderful stuff there.  Oh, sure. [LAUGH] It's kind of like the, um, movie monitoring.  I do -- sometimes do mystery shopping.  Have you ever heard of that?
L:  Really?
R:  I do that.  I try to do that whenever I have a spare minute, but it's nice, because they pay for you to go out to dinner --
L:  And you do as far as what customer service is like or how they handle people and so on?
R:  -- and you do the same kind of thing, you know, you're observing all the customer service and --
L:  And in the rest- -- really?  In the restaurant, do they pay for your meal?
R:  -- it's the same exact thing, but you're going to a movie and I go to dinner, or else I'll do [inaudible] book store, you know, things like that.  Yeah, it's very fun.  Right, everything that goes on in the store, you know, how the store looks.
L:  And when you do this, what do you do as far as the restaurant, do you -- do you -- do you -- do you judge the food, do you judge the service, cleanliness?
R:  Yes, they pay for your whole meal and many companies will pay a fee --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for you to fill out the report online, like ten to thirty dollars, depending on the company, you know, just for your time to fill out the report when you get home.
L:  That's great.  How often -- how often do you do --
R:  Right, everything, absolutely everything, cleanliness, everything.  You have to go to the bathroom, see if that's clean, I mean, anything you can think of, you have to be watching for.  How long it's --
