R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Willa.
L:  Hi Willa.  I'm Louise.
R:  Hi Louise.  Ah, I am living here in Florida.
L:  Oh, very nice.  I'm in Red Bank, New Jersey.
R:  Oh, I'm -- my children live in New Jersey, right near Red Bank.
L:  Oh.
R:  Homedale -- one is in Homedale and one's --
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  -- in Marlboro[?], and one is in Wall[?].
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, kind of familiar with Red Bank, it's a lovely town.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just moved here.
R:  Oh, did you?  I think you'll love it.  Ah, I hope you play computer games, because I know very little about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, well, I do.  I -- in fact, they're addictive to me.
R:  Are -- are you really? So --
L:  Um, well --
R:  -- tell me about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  that's part of the problem, is that it does become an addiction. Ah, well, I -- I always enjoyed playing games, and Yahoo, I don't know if you're familiar with Yahoo?
R:  Yes, yes I have my [inaudible].
L:  Has a lot of games -- free games to play --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, ah, but I usually play things like Text Twi- Twist, which is rearranging, you know, the -- it's like Scrabble.
R:  Oh, it's -- it's, ah, rearranging letters and --
L:  Right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And making as many words as you can --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, Literati is like Scrabble, but you play against other people --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's very time consuming though --
R:  Oh oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I play usually things that are, like what would the word be?  Well --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, a little more literate than, ah -- not mindless games in other words.
L:  Well, some mindless -- some mindless --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- if I can't -- but if they're challenging.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, okay.  That's --
L:  But you -- do you don't play any at all?
R:  I'll tell you the truth.  I am not a -- a competitive person.  I play no games at all.  Ah, I don't, ah -- I don't compete in any form or fashion.  I really have never enjoyed it.  Um --
L:  That's interesting.  I never thought of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as being competitive --
R:  Yeah it [inaudible].
L:  -- but, I would imagine it is, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I never thought of it that way.
R:  It is a very competi-, you know, those are competitive things, and, ah, I've never enjoyed competition.  I have always, ah, shied away from that and gone toward something where I should learn something.  You know, I'd take a class instead of playing a game.  My husband is very addicted to Bridge, ah, but not on the computer.  He's a Bridge expert, ah, he goes to clubs and so, he's highly competitive.  Ah, but I've never been, so I've never tried any of that.
L:  Well, part of the question was also, do you play on the computer or cd-rom.  I don't -- I mean I've heard of cd-rom, but I'm not sure I know what that is.
R:  Ah, I don't either, because, ah, I don't actually have a computer.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I have -- I have an internet appliance, where you can play games on it, you know, people do, but, ah, I've never tried since I wasn't interested.
L:  Maybe a cd-rom is that, you know -- a special --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- software that you just insert into your computer and --
R:  Yeah, it must be.  I know, I've never done anything like that.
L:  Yeah.  I'd -- that I've never done either.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Expect when I visited a friend in England, because she wa- -- she used to play the British version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And, ah, but British version, which is very, very difficult, because it's all about the kings and queens of yore --
R:  Oh, great.
L:  -- and she was quite brilliant at it --
R:  Ah, really?
L:  -- and, ah -- yes.  And we'd sit up --
R:  Uh-huh.  Because it's -- that could put you to sleep, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, not really, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- she -- because of my addiction with any kind of game --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I found myself staying up with her three consecutive nights 'til two three o'clock --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- in the morning.
R:  Oh, my.  [LAUGH]
L:  I was pretty much guessing at the answers --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- while she pretty much knew them --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, yeah, I guess that was like a cd-rom, 'cause she actually had to insert into the --
R:  The computer?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's -- it's different, you know, and wherever you go I guess it is different.  My English friend wrote -- just wrote me that she's trying to learn how to use the internet.  She feels very stupid because she hasn't been able to, ah -- to master it.  I hope she does, because it's easier than writing letters, you know.  [LAUGH] It -- it --
L:  Oh, the Word portion, absolutely.
R:  Oh, sure, sure.  So, how -- how many hours a day do you do this, ah?
L:  Well, I tried -- I start cutting down because it was just occupying too -- and especially when I moved I got --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- so busy with the move --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, um, so I -- I cut back --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- considerably.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, not a day goes by that I disconnect, that I'll turn off the computer without at least playing one to two games.
R:  Oh, that's amazing.
L:  But just, you know, going in, playing maybe in, mm, half an hour to an hour --
R:  Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, then giving up.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Not giving up, but knowing that it's just --
R:  Enough, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, my friend's husband, he did the same and she constantly complained because she said soo- soon as he came in from work, he'd eat --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and go right to the computer --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- and just stay on 'til eleven o'clock at night playing a certain -- one game in particular --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- night after night after night.
R:  Oh, my.  Well, that's a -- that could ruin a marriage.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially if the spouse isn't interested in the same thing.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I mean talk about addiction --
R:  Right.
L:  -- oppression.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that is an obsession, right.  Ah, no, I --
L:  And he would play the m- -- the mind- -- the real mindless games, I mean, like that they were so retarded that --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- I just -- I couldn't understand -- I -- for as much as I love to play games --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean at least in something like Literati --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you're using your --
R:  Your head.
L:  -- brain a little --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in trying to come up with words and --
R:  Oh, I can understand that.  I've done that on, you know, pencil and paper, but not -- not on the computer at all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, that never, ah, got to me at all.  I -- I was just not interested in learning how to do it, ah, so I --
L:  Well, it's -- it's fairly easy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, when you're playing against someone else out there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the, ah -- someone else -- you're playing against someone else --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they get very angry if they lose --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and it's -- like you don't even know who you're playing against --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and if you don't respond to them, they tur- -- they'd rather, 'cause there's a chat room in the Literati game --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and some of them, depending -- especially if they're very young --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they want, "How old are you?"  They're on the make some of them.
R:  Oh, oh, interesting.  [LAUGH] It's a way of meeting.
L:  And then if you try to ignore them a little and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just give them quick answers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not to be rude, then they get nasty --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and or if they're very competitive and immature, you get responses like, um, "You're holding -- you're holding them back from getting a win".  Well, that's the object of the game.
R:  Yeah, of course.  Isn't that the object of any game?
L:  You know, and then [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then they disconnect --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and leave you just hanging there.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So it does get a little silly.
R:  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  I -- well, that's immaturity I believe.  I know my husband has friends who use the computer for -- to play Bridge, ah, and you're playing against other people too and you don't know who these people are.  Ah, one of our friends played against somebody, ah, in, ah, I think he said in China.  He actually was playing against someone on the other side of the world.  That's what makes the computer so fascinating I guess.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, I know in Europe it's a -- -the game is slightly different, so, ah, I don't know have that [LAUGH] -- how you could really reconcile this, since you play with a partner basically, so I don't know how that would work.  Four people getting together like if they're sitting around a table, but they're -- they're on computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I can't imagine how this could possibly work well if you don't know exactly what the other person is talking about, you know, but it -- it's --
L:  Well, I've played with people from South America --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- from Italy --
R:  Really?
L:  -- well, England obviously, they speak our language --
R:  Oh, well, almost.
L:  -- um, but they all spoke --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- enough English to --
R:  Enough, yeah, mhm.  Well, I -- I travel a lot, and I find around the world now, ah, people in every country seem to speak some English.
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, wherever I go, someone is trying to practice English on me, so, ah, I find that -- that's interesting, so I imagine the computer has something to do with that.
L:  Very well could be.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, when did you start this?
L:  Computer, or playing games?
R:  Ah, the games on the computer.
L:  I think when I first started using, ah -- for me, when I first became familiar with using the computer.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, where I worked in my office, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to learn -- well, most people when they want to teach you how to use the computer, you start playing Solitaire.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, to -- to enable you to move the mouse around, that's one of the first --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, lessons most of us get --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, you have to --
