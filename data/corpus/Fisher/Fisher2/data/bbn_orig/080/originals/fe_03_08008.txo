R:  [NOISE] Hello this is Paula.
L:  Paula?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, my name's Kathy.  How are you?
R:  I'm all right.  How are you doing this evening?
L:  I'm -- I just got home so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- bear with me if I'm kind of s- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a little rushed.
R:  Oh, there's no problem, 'cause I'm feeding my kids, so I'm rushed too.
L:  How old are they?
R:  Ah, well, I have a seven month old and there is a three year old and a one year old here visiting.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, it's a house full of munchkins.  [NOISE]
L:  Absolute-
R:  Anyway, so I think the topic is movies.
L:  Yes, in fact we were just having a little family argument about going out to the movies tonight.
R:  Oh, really, why, 'cause you couldn't agree?
L:  No, it's just that my husband and I were gone pretty much all day and so I haven't seen my own kids, and I wanted to do something with them but I don't want to go sit in a movie theater with them.
R:  Ah, that's not like -- that's not interactive enough, right?
L:  It's not interactive at all, no, so --
R:  Exactly, it's kind of like when I was dating I remember thinking, I -- I didn't ever want to go to a movie on a first date 'cause I want to talk -- have a conversation with the guy.
L:  I know, isn't that the worst?
R:  Yeah, and like we would sit there and like zombies, yeah.  So, it's funny, I feel the same way, but I haven't -- this is our first child and I haven't been to the movies since I had my baby, [NOISE] which is terrible because I love -- I love going to the movies and I love the stadium theater or the stadium seatings they have now.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, where you -- no one's in your face and no one's in your way.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You can see everything, so.
L:  Well, that's the one thing that we drastically learned -- is that we gave up, is that we couldn't go to the movies any more, 'cause we used to go at least once or twice a week.
R:  Yeah, it's funny, 'cause my husband and I went, like, once a week or, you know, probably four or five times a month.  He loves going to the movies.  [NOISE]
L:  How long have you been married?
R:  Ah, for five years.
L:  Five years and you just --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- had your first?
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.  How about you?
L:  Um, twelve --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- and I have a nine, seven and five year old so we [inaudible].
R:  Oh my gosh, that's a nice -- nice mix.
L:  Yeah, we rent a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think sometimes I would almost rather rent just because, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they can't sit for a very long time anyway.
R:  Well, exactly.  I mean, if you want to do it as a family I think renting makes a lot more sense and if they fall asleep you can just put them off to bed, right?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah [NOISE] the thing --
L:  But my husband and I --
R:  I found another s- --
L:  -- really never --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  My husband and I never go to movies.
R:  Now, do you want to though?
L:  Oh, all the time.  We just don't never get baby sitters.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Well, I guess, I mean, it gets to be a kind of expensive evening if you've got the movie, you've got the popcorn and you have a baby sitter, you know, it starts adding up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, so, what was the last movie you saw?
L:  At the theater?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Um.
R:  Do you remember?
L:  I dou- -- ah, we just, see, we just don't go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, we just -- we really don't go that often and I'm sure it was a kid movie because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we just started taking 'em --
R:  Okay, now there's that --
L:  -- and my --
R:  -- movie out about the fish, that Disney movie, it's supposed to be pr- -- great for kids and adults.  Have you heard of it?
L:  Yes, in fact I think my husband took 'em.
R:  Oh, he did?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] Well, it's good because those movies they make so like the adults get the humor too.  [NOISE]
L:  That's what I loved about Toy Story.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my gosh, that's a great movie.
L:  It was -- we loved to watch that one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I do have to admit, it is getting pretty nice to where my -- since my kids are getting a little bit older --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that they -- we can start watching, maybe some PG movies that are really actually kind of cute. 
R:  Right, right.  That actually have like a little more than just animated characters in them.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's funny, 'cause the last movie I went to I was, um, I was two weeks overdue when I had my daughter and it was -- I was -- this is -- I was probably in my, I don't know, like, first or second week of being overdue, and I went out to the movies and I was -- I was a little bit embarrassed but I really didn't care because I was so swollen, I brought a pillow with me, I brought this big huge bed pillow and I walked into the movie theater with the pillow 'cause the only way I could sit comfortably for two hours was if I had a huge pillow below my, you know, on my back --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I can't believe they let you go that long.
R:  -- and I thought, you know what, even if -- I thought if -- even if I'm not pregnant I'm going to bring a pillow next time 'cause it's so comfortable.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, it made a lot of fun.  But, I don't know, now do you have a big screen TV at home?
L:  Yes we do.
R:  Yeah.  That's gotta make the movie rental different -- a different experience.  I --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- mean doesn't it make you feel like it's a little theater.  Do you have the whole surround sound or, like, how is your sound set up?
L:  Oh, it's wonderful, we do have the surround sound and that's why --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's so nice because, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we can do that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but we usually do that a lot in the middle of, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- winter.  We do a lot of renting in the middle of winter.
R:  Yeah, right.  Now, do you live in a cold -- where do you -- where do you live?
L:  We live, um, [LIPSMACK] in the mid west.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, I'm in Missouri actually.  Where are you?
R:  Oh, ah, I'm in Philadelphia.  I mean, we still have winters but not [MN] -- I grew up in up state New York and we had cold, snowy winters that went on forever, so lots of movie rentals and fire places and things like that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know, so, but I -- I -- I really think if -- I mean, we probably have like a thirty two inch color TV and if we had a large screen TV I know he'd be -- my husband would be much more interested in renting a lot of movies.
L:  Um.
R:  Now do you have direct TV yet, where you can rent movies whenever you want off the, um, off your cable?
L:  No, not yet, but I --
R:  Is it available in your area?
L:  I- it's available but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm sure some day we'll get it.
R:  It's dangerous because it's -- you can rent, I mean, you rent a movie at any point and you can watch it for twenty four hours, you can fast forward it, rewind it, it's so convenient.
L:  Ah, see that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what I'm -- but see my kids are all going to be in school next year.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow, that must be like a -- a rite of passage.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh my go- -- well, you know, it's just -- we're at the point that like, "What am I going to do with all my time?"
R:  Oh, I bet.  I mean, work for ten years, I -- is your ol- -- you said your oldest is nine, right, or nine years --
L:  Right.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I'm scared to death.
R:  Uh-huh.  I know, it's so exciting that -- now, are you involved in their school stuff at all?
L:  Well, yeah, a little bit, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's hard though, when you have one still at home too.
R:  Right, right.  So you got to kind of drag them everywhere.
L:  Yeah, and you know, of course, he just doesn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, he's -- it's really hard.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  'Cause you try to focus on him and --
R:  Right.  [NOISE] Now --
L:  -- but anyway.
R:  -- now, is the youngest in full day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- school now?  Is the first grade full day or?
L:  Um, they will actually be going into fourth grade, second grade and kindergarten.
R:  Oh wow.  Now, do you have k- -- full day kindergarten in your --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- area, or is it ...?  It is full day?
L:  Yes.
R:  Wow, that's great.
L:  So, it's nice, I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it really is, but you know, they have a quiet time and recess and so I mean, I don't know how it is in academics but --
R:  Yeah, but this part -- I think this -- my -- my sister teaches full day kindergarten.  I think just kind of getting them used to the schedule is really good.  You know, getting them used to following the schedule and working in groups and things like that.
L:  Yes.
R:  That seems to -- that seems to be, you know, one of the benefits of kindergarten.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how interesting.  Now, what about i- i- -- just the, ah -- the parent, if they show movies at school [MN] are you told of them?  Like do they say, ah, "You know, as part of our second grade class we're gonna watch a movie about this", I mean, do you know what they see?
L:  No, not at all.
R:  That's interesting, 'cause I was -- my sister has, um, a fourth grader and they showed some -- I forget what movie it was, I think it was like -- or was it, no, fifth grade and they were learning about, like, Caesar Augustus and -- and they showed a movie, like a -- a -- a PBS movie and a lot of parents complained it was so violent and the only reason they knew about it was 'cause the kids were talking about it.  So, I thought, you know, there's a lot of PG movies that people might not show a third grader, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, I don't know, I think -- oh careful Sarah -- I think it all depends on like the teaching and, you know -- and the institution there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.
L:  But, you know, it is kind of amazing because I think we let our kids see too much violence, and which reminded me, the last movie we did see was The Matrix.
R:  Was the what?
L:  The Matrix.
R:  Oh, okay.  I didn't -- I'm not familiar with that.
L:  Well, um, and I certainly understand where you are because when I had small children, I never knew what was at the movie theater because we never went --
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, um, now that I do have a nine year old and he watches a lot of the shoot 'em up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- movies with my husband and they wanted to see The Matrix and I actually didn't think it was bad at all.  There was one love scene that I -- I could have done without, but I thought the violence was ten times better than some of the stuff they see on TV.
R:  Yeah, really?  Now, what's The Matrix about, I [MN]?
L:  The Matrix was that movie with Keanu Reeves and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was really -- if you -- it was like a -- this was a sequel to one that was out a couple of years ago.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, now that you say that, yeah, I remember Keanu Reeves.  I [several inaudible words] the plot, I bet you my [NOISE] --
L:  Well.
R:  -- [NOISE] husband saw it, 'cause that sounds like something that he'd be into.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, he loved it, and it's so hard to follow.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's very, very science fiction --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and so he bas- -- 
R:  [NOISE] Uh.
L:  -- enjoyed it but I don't think they understand the concept of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a person turning into a robot kills the person.
R:  Yeah, that's kind of -- that -- that sounds like a little bit -- a little complex.  I mean, sometimes in science fiction ones, I think, are the hardest for kids.  Or they think they -- they think that [MN] [NOISE].
L:  But they just don't understand that -- yeah, I mean, it's better than -- I'd much rather them see that than someone, you know, taking a gun and blowing their head off --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- and they show it.
R:  Did you see Pulp Fiction?
L:  No, haven't.
R:  Oh my gosh, that was one of the -- that was such a violent movie.  I mean, it got so bad I had my eyes closed, it was so violent.
L:  See and I -- ever since I heard it was that violent, I didn't see it.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well I -- you know, I like to do -- I like to go to movies that I know absolutely nothing about, I just like to kind of get there and pick a title.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [NOISE] B- because sometimes I just think that if I see the preview, sometimes with previews, it's like you see the whole movie or you -- or you know the basic story.  I mean, I kind of like the surprise of not having any idea and I went to Pulp Fiction thinking it was about a band, I -- I thought it was about a pop band, I don't know why but, ah, tha- that was but, um, and I just couldn't bel- --
