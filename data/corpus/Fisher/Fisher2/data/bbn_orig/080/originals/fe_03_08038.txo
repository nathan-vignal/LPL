L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I think I stopped after, like, the third expansion pack, 'cause it just got to be too expensive --
L:  [NOISE] Ah, huh-uh.
R:  -- yeah, and sometimes I play it on the internet, I haven't lately though.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Like, I've been working a lot and everything so my -- I don't have as much free time.  I used to do it out of boredom, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- so, but I just don't have very much time left, like you said.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know, I used -- 'cause, like, when I -- I used to, um, stay out in the -- in San Diego --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] with my aunt, um.  I used to watch her kids and, um, I used to always play with them, 'cause that's what they liked a lot so, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] I'd play with them and then recently, no, I've been, ah, working, I work with the elderly people.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I enjoy that, so.
R:  Do you?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  That's nice.  I mean, you know, some people consider it like a job but --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- if you enjoy it, that's good.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, pretty much I do that and, um, it's like, little things, like, I'll baby sit or that 'cause I just really enjoy that.  I -- I had an offer for another job, working at, like, c- car insurance place or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] but I didn't have a chance to get there 'cause I was too busy so.
R:  Yeah.

R:  Right, you're more of a people person, hands on.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, and --
R:  So.
L:  -- [NOISE] if I could like do that to like maybe kind of change your life and make their life a little bit better and, you know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- [NOISE] 'cause like, they're going through something, you know, I want to talk to them about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] or whatever, so I just like to, you know, do that.
R:  I know it, and a lot of them don't have family support either.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think that's sad.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but, um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, what else can we --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, ten -- ten minutes doesn't seem like very long 'til you've got to talk it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Have you done one of these before?
L:  [NOISE] Excuse me?
R:  Have you done one of these before?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, just one of them.  This is my, actually, second one.
R:  Me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Don't -- don't they give you, like, three of 'em or something or --
R:  Yeah, we're supposed to get three.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And, I think a couple of times the machi- -- you know, the service called or whatever --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I didn't take the calls, I was busy or doing something so.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, me too, I'm like, the answering machine came on and I answered it, I'm like, oh, I got to go, I got to go, I felt bad, I'm like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] I gotta go so I just hung up and --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- [NOISE] I didn't get to do nothing.
R:  Where I was trying to take a nap and I didn't feel like doing it, you know what I mean?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  So.
L:  [NOISE] So, once you complete the three of them, then you, like --
R:  Get the thirty dollars?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I think that's how it works, but then --
L:  [NOISE] I, ah.
R:  -- I'm not certain, 'cause I thought some people were getting them as they completed it, but I'm not sure.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, 'cause --
R:  It's been so long since I went online to figure out --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh, and what --
R:  -- what it was.
L:  -- [NOISE] oh, so, ah, you -- you heard for this online?
R:  Mhm, I heard --
L:  [NOISE] I --
R:  -- about it online.

L:  -- [NOISE] why, I heard about my -- through my aunt or something like that, she told --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] and she's like, "Oh, yeah, do you want to do it?"  I'm like, "Okay, yeah", and she's like, "You get ten dollars for each call", and I'm like "Okay".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's not bad.  The --

R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] yeah, but it -- it -- it was -- it was nice, I went, um, fishing and crabbing all the time.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, it was really nice, I caught crabs and ate them, but it was kind of gross, I didn't want to watch, like, my, um, ex boyfriend, he lives out there and I didn't want to, um, watch him cook 'em or, you know, prepare them 'cause I'd get grossed out.
R:  It does.
L:  [NOISE] But then when I eat it I try not to think about it but it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] good though [LAUGH], it was really pretty over there.
R:  Yeah, my kids are like that too.
