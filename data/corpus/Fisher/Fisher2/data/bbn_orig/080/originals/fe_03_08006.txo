L:  Hi. [COUGH]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Arlene.
R:  My name is Rudi.
L:  Rudi?  Hi.
R:  Yes.  How are you doing?
L:  You sound like you're from the South.
R:  Uh, yes, from Texas.
L:  Ah.
R:  And you are from?
L:  Hawaii.
R:  Hawaii?  How about that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  I am not believing I am talking to you all the way across the ocean.
L:  Yeah, right here on a beautiful, sunny Hawaiian day. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, imagine --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- imagine.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's pretty warm here in Texas right now.
L:  Is this your first survey?
R:  Uh, no, really it's about my tenth.
L:  Okay, so you know the routine then?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I think the question was, uh, would we rather go to the movies or would we rather rent and, uh, we would -- I'll tell you right now, we're married and have four kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that would be astronomical to go to the movies, you know, n- --
L:  Well, it sure would.
R:  -- not unless, you know, we go to the early bird and then it's not so bad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we sort of go -- go to the rented, uh, uh, you know, movies or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we even get 'em from our library, but we enjoy -- we -- in fact, we try to spend Friday evening as our family movie night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so if we can gather everybody up, but, uh, three girls and one boy and, uh, ages from twelve to three, so sometimes the ast- -- a- attention span is -- is challenging. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just like the [inaudible]
L:  Yeah, that and finding a movie that appealed to everybody would be tough, too.
R:  Right.  Well, you know what?  We find older movies to be appealing -- more appealing to the kids than --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the newer ones but, uh, so- -- a lot of Disney movies, uh, although Mom and I go, "Yeah, we can -- we can sit through this" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  Uh, but I enjoy 'em too.  But, uh, that's basically what we do.  I went to --
L:  Well, we would enjoy going out, it's just my husband and I, and we would really enjoy going out, you know, getting the popcorn and a hotdog and all of that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but the last few times we have been to the movies, we just keep saying, "Never again".
R:  Yeah, uh --
L:  Uh, you know, the choices are no good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people aren't particularly, you know, um --
R:  Courteous? [LAUGH]
L:  Courteous, yes, thank you.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  It's the s- -- it's the --
L:  -- a- --
R:  -- same with my wife and I.
L:  And it's, like, I just don't wanna be in a crowd, I don't wanna pay.  The money keeps going up all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, still, for two people, it's not a bad night out, but I wanna go and have a good experience, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we've been finding that we're renting movies more and more.
R:  Well, that's great.  Do you have a good selection and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and up to date and everything?
L:  Pretty much, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We -- w- -- it's not bad.  We don't have a lot of video stores, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to choose from.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, there's no Blockbuster, or a big place like that near me.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, we do have a little video store.  In fact, last night we t- -- watched two really good ones, The Sum of All Fears --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, [MN] um, oh, Domestic Disturbance.
R:  Hm.
L:  They were kind of violent, they wouldn't be really good kid movies at all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but we found them both intriguing.
R:  And that's what limit -- limits us.  I mean, even -- we have cable here at the house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but even at that, our viewing is very limited and even if you get on any of the -- what we call the big four channels, you know, which are the local national channels, uh, they are even tending to be more on the violent end too, so --
L:  You know, they sure are, and one night we were watching and flipping between the regular, you know, networks and it's, like, every show started with an autopsy.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  And I just said, you know, "I don't wanna watch this".
R:  And you wonder what -- and now, [MN] granted, like you said, you have no kids, but w- when you see how much our kids are exposed it, any kids, really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, they're pretty well -- well versed in a lot of things like, you know, any type of crime, any type of, uh, uh, scandal [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and a lot a language that we try not to use.  I mean, we're surely not perfect but we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sure don't go around, you know, slamming beers and throwing cigarettes [LAUGH] and stuff, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, uh, it's, uh, it -- it is a challenge, it really is, but in -- in, uh, the movie part, my wife and I haven't really seen a movie in about three or four years because of the fact of we're real picky about the movies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and -- and we're not saying that we're better off than anybody else or -- or even better, it's just that, uh, when we try to go and see a movie, we would either wanna laugh or see a real good -- I guess tearjerker but, uh, not necessarily that's what we're going for, we're going to get entertained but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I believe Hollywood's, uh, thinking on entertainment is really distorted.
L:  And I get really disturbed at [COUGH] all the money these people are making.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And their, you know, extravagant lifestyle and drug use, and what a poor role model they are.
R:  Yes, they are.  I mean, they go through, uh, marriages like they're water.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, they seem to, uh, not adhere to either, uh, changing the color of their hair [LAUGH] many times in one year or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just a -- an a- abundance of things that it just, uh, seems like it's the ti- -- uh, the, uh, it's the way of the world.
L:  A- and that's not the real world.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, i- it is the way of the world, so --
L:  And, you know, and -- and kids see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, they idolize the -- those people and they think that's cool to be like that, and that's not it at all.
R:  That -- and that's true.  That's true.  It's -- it's, uh, not everybody is, uh, s- succumbs to what they -- they go through. [NOISE] I'm having a -- a three year old follow me, so that's why I'm sort of --
L:  [LAUGH] I can hear. [LAUGH]
R:  -- sounds like I'm moving around. [LAUGH] [NOISE] But -- would you take him in the other room, please?  But, uh, it -- [SIGH] it -- like I said, it really is a -- a -- a challenge for us to sit down and -- and watch a movie and keep everybody's attention and plus keep it wholesome but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- getting back to some of the older movies --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and really, some of [LAUGH] -- it -- I get a kick out of it.  Some of 'em are black and white and my kids look at 'em and go, "Are they going to be like this all the way through the movie?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then when I go, "Yes, this one is black and white, you know, but --" but you'll -- you'll enjoy it" and they end up enjoying it but, uh, I guess it was just a different time and -- and, uh, there was a lot a ... well, there was just a lot of different values that were -- were actually valued --
L:  Ri- --
R:  -- you know, uh, more at that time.  Not that there's not now, but it just seems like there's far and in between when you find a person, uh, with a -- that character trait.
L:  And -- and there are, um, good movies out there, and like you say, many of 'em are a little older.  One that comes to my mind is Overboard.
R:  Yeah, in fact, we saw that the other day on, uh --
L:  That's w- -- you know, that's a favorite of mine and my husband's always, like, "Not another one of those three year old movies" and it's, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Well, you know, I happen to like it --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- what's wrong with that?"
R:  Right --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they're -- and really, they are, they're classics, uh, of course, uh, on the cable here, a lot -- there's two different, uh, classic movie channels, that one of them, there's, like, no commercials at all, so we have to remember that when we actually get into a movie there we're [LAUGH] -- we're there for the duration, or we're going to miss part of it.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and then the other one is -- is they'll go through -- well, like, recently, Gregory Peck passed away, so they had went through, like, all of his movies --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and those -- some of those were just really i- -- really neat to watch.  But then, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm also, uh, aging myself also, because I'm a baby boomer so, uh, it -- it -- I was born in fifty so it -- it's, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I've seen a lot -- I remember going to the movies for a quarter, so that -- there's -- there's been quite a difference.
L:  I remember that too.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Well, good.  But, uh, it's --
L:  I -- I sure wish they'd -- they'd revamp this whole thing, lower the prices and get something that isn't so violent.
R:  Right, right.  Now, here in Texas, they do have a few places that actually have the old drive ins, but they're so far away for us.  But --
L:  Oh, that would be fun.
R:  -- but they -- you -- they l- -- well, once the video stores opened and the VCRs came in and the DVDs and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it just basically shut everything -- everybody sort of drew back, you know, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, and -- and wanted to do their own thing but, uh, uh, I don't -- I don't know if my kids are ever going to know what a drive in is or not, you know, but they used to be all over town here.  But they're -- they're just not.
L:  Th- that used to a big date when I was growing up.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I imagine it -- and it was for me too.  And --
L:  But you had -- you couldn't go with just, like, on a date, you had to go with a group of people.
R:  Sure, yeah.  Yeah, and it -- it was always, uh, just sort of neat to -- a -- a different atmosphere.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, none of the speakers really worked great, but [LAUGH] -- or they were, uh, i- it -- the -- having the big, big screen there was, uh, was something else, but gosh, there used to be ... so many around, I don't think there's one open, uh, in the Dallas Fort Worth area which we're -- which I'm from, not Dallas, but Fort --
