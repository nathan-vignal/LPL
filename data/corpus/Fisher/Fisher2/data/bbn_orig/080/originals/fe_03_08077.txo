L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hello.
L:  Hi.  This is Stef.
R:  Hi.  I'm Gerald.  How are you?
L:  How you doing?  I'm good.
R:  I'm good, too.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  Uh, we're supposed to be talking about, uh, how you get the most of your current events.
L:  [MN] Right [NOISE].
R:  Uh --
L:  Um, I must say I get mine from TV mostly.
R:  TV?
L:  Mhm.
R:  What?  The news?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, um --
L:  Wh- what about you?
R:  Um, mainly word of mouth.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I don't look at TV much --
L:  [NOISE] So, like --
R:  -- 'cause it's so depressing [LAUGH].
L:  -- like, uh, at work or something everyone talks about it?
R:  Well, yeah, and like at social gatherings, at the bar and all.  That's the ones I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they'll kind of bring up something that's current --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's how I usually get it and sometimes on the radio --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, you hear certain things but mostly word of mouth.
L:  Mhm.  I stay home mostly so I don't get a lot of contact, um, with anybody over eight [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- usually during the day so as long as they stay up I either have to, um, [LIPSMACK] watch TV or go on the Internet --
R:  Oh, so you [MN] --
L:  -- sometimes -- sometimes read the paper.
R:  Oh, so that's another, uh, means of getting it from the Internet?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  You go on everyday?
L:  Yeah.  I, um, like, go in all the time and I -- and I -- lot of times I'll be talking to people on it, like, with messenger boards kind of thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, kind of get into discussions that way but, um, yeah, uh -- So, where are you at?
R:  Philly.
L:  Where?
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, both of the people I've talked to, uh, everybody I've talked to have -- has been, um, pretty far.  I'm in Denver.
R:  Colorado?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you got a lot of current events going on there [LAUGH]?
L:  Um [MN], not really [LAUGH].  Mostly the weather is the way -- [NOISE] we've had some really weird [NOISE] -- we've had some really weird weather here [MN] [NOISE].
R:  What's it like?
L:  What's that?
R:  What's it like?  The weather?
L:  Well, it's been pretty cool this year and actually it's finally starting to warm up.  Usually, you know, by the first or second week in June it's pretty warm [NOISE] but this year was just really weird [NOISE] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, what about up there?  Is it humid?
R:  Yeah, it's very humid and hot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, yeah, I'm surprised you didn't get that over the, um, TV --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how our weather is.
L:  Yeah, I remember hearing something about New York being really hot.
R:  Yeah, they have, like, a heat wave watch.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and there's so many people there that I guess there's a lot of people in danger of [NOISE] -- of, like, they think it's a heat wave and [NOISE] heat stroke and that.
R:  How do you get so many current events over the, um --?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- TV in the daytime?  It seems like they show a lot of soap operas.
L:  Oh, no.  I usually watch the CNN or --
R:  You have cable?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's a good one.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I watch the -- the [NOISE] the, uh [LAUGH], the news channels just because the -- I can't do Jerry Springer anymore.  That's just -- Jerry Springer and the soap operas -- I haven't watched the soap operas for probably four or five years so --
R:  Do you think they show enough current events on TV?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  If you're looking for it you can definitely find it twenty four seven.  You can find anything you want, any topic you want.  It's there [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, but the only thing is, like, you either got to catch the news, uh, like we have, like, ten o'clock news and five o'clock news.  It's not like content, you know, all day long, you don't get, like, updates, like, at twelve o'clock.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, you don't get too much current events over TV then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unless you have cable like you do.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, we get -- we get, like, about it's not quite a hundred stations but you can get more than that if you get a dish but I don't, uh, I don't get that.  It's too many.  It's too many choices and it seems like the more channels there are the less there is on so -- so when I visit my brother in LA he's got, like, three hundred channels and I can [LAUGH] never find anything to watch so --
R:  Well, lot of channels so s- show the same thing over and over again.
L:  Oh, yeah, or they'd be in a different language that I don't understand or, um, you know, devoted to some special interest or some --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  And do you guys get, uh, um, like, a daily newspaper?
L:  Yeah, we get the Rocky Mountain news.  What about you?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we get, uh, everyday news.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You get a lot of [MN] exemption there.  Then you got the Metro if you take public transit and they're in the bus stations and everywhere, they tell you news.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I have, like, a, um, neighborhood paper.
L:  Mhm.  Do you -- do you take mass transportation break -- when -- when you get around out there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gee, I guess you have to there, huh?
R:  Mm not necessarily [LAUGH].  Just about every neighborhood has what you want in it.  You really don't have to leave it.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah, unless you want to go to a mall or something.
L:  Well, yeah, it just seems like out east it's the population is so densely packed that it -- it's hard to drive cars out there.  I rented a car in New York one time and I was really sorry that I did [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  
L:  It was like --
R:  New York's not the place to drive [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] No, and I didn't get the -- the little waiver deal where you can -- where it replaces the car if you crash the car --
R:  Oh, Jesus.
L:  -- and -- and I'm sitting in this tunnel and I hear, like, two or three collisions just while I'm in the tunnel.  I'm thinking, "Oh, my god.  What have I done"?
R:  I'm surprised you don't see how they drive on TV on the news how --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they do in New York.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] Yeah, I didn't.  Out here, you know, you got all this open space and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'course it's getting pretty bad here, too, though.  You -- you got a lot of traffic jams but you -- you got to have a car 'cause everything's so spaced out.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  It's just sprawled out.  You know, it's not all -- it's not all in one -- one little spot.  It -- I guess it just goes on and on from town to town out there.
R:  How's the crime rate there?
L:  Um, not bad.
R:  Not bad?
L:  No.  It's -- it's -- seems to be going down actually.
R:  Small town.
L:  Yeah, it's got a small town [NOISE] feel but it's actually, you know, bigger than most people think [NOISE] --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but, yeah.  So, what's -- what's going on in the news right now?  I don't even know.  Haven't been looking at the TV.
R:  Well, I haven't -- I don't watch TV all day long until, like, late at night I might turn it on to catch the news.  Usually I just catch the weather.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's so many current events that they're just wild, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's depressing a lot.
L:  Oh, it really is.
R:  You hear more about people getting killed and abductions and things like that than you'd hear about good things so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  The news is kind of depressing to me.
L:  Yeah, it is [NOISE].  Yeah, I have a hard time with it sometimes, too [NOISE] and it seems like, you know, every -- every hour there's something -- there's something going on, you know, breaking story [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.  It's not always good [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] No [MN].
R:  I guess ni- -- ha- -- current events mean bad news [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, and -- and --
R:  Then late at night on TV they might show you what's going on in the city around here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, then you -- it's -- it's kind of enlightening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like late at night, but then everybody's sleeping so you really don't get the update on what's going on around the city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause it comes on so late.
L:  Yeah, doesn't prime time goes till, like, eleven there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  On -- with the shows and everything 'cause here it s- cuts off at ten.  We're all mountain time.  We're in the nether zone for the -- for the, um, time zones 'cause they --
R:  Oh, you get the little sitcoms late at night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's not, you know, there's no -- no news or nothing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  As far as events you don't get those.  You got to look -- tune in all day to kind of catch what's going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or watch, like I said, the evening news or the late night news.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you guys go on  -- go on to a college with this study?
L:  [NOISE] Going to college?
R:  Going through a college?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, University of Pennsylvania, isn't it [NOISE]?
R:  Oh, uh, you, too?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think that's -- that's the, uh, the number that's been calling.
R:  Yeah.  That's funny and they call you all the way in Denver.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Yeah, I don't know how I, uh, even -- what I did to hook up with this deal but --
R:  I wonder if they considered it a current event [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  Yeah, what is a current event anyway [NOISE]?
R:  What's the most current event you know about?
L:  Um, like I said, I haven't been watching the TV for -- I had a baby about two and a half weeks ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she's kind of put me in another world right now so I don't -- I haven't been paying attention a whole lot --
R:  No.
L:  -- besides things that relate to babies and kids.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know that always catches my eye if I see something like that going on but [NOISE] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] yeah, I -- I get kind of tunnel visioned [NOISE] but I -- I was watching -- I was checking out that -- that Lacey Pearson trial --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, the lady who's -- the baby and her were floated up -- floated up in San Francisco Bay.
R:  She threw it in the water?
L:  Well, no.  I think her husband killed her.  She was eight months pregnant or they say he did.  He's been accused.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Killed the, um, lady and the -- she was pregnant with the baby.
L:  Yeah, and about the time she and the baby washed up I was, like, exactly that pregnant so I just -- I really, you know...
