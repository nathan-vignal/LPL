L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a good of a thing for them to be doing, like it subjects them to so much violence and everything.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Like my favorite game on P.S. [several inaudible words] --

L:  My brother and my sister --
R:  Are they younger than you?
L:  -- are like -- we have like over a hundred kid's games, like at my house.
R:  So, do your parents have to like --
L:  Yeah.  They're younger than me --
R:  -- watch what games they play and stuff?
L:  -- and they're just -- like, that's all they do is sit on the computer all day and I'm like you guys are ...  Yeah.  Well, not really.  My -- like -- 
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but my -- my older brother's getting at that age right now where he's starting to try to act like a teenager.  He's eight.  So, he thinks he's -- he -- he thinks he can hang with the teenagers and he tries to hang out with all my friends and stuff but, no.  But, yeah, my Mom's really having to monitor him right now on what he -- with his content --
R:  Oh.

R:  Like my cousin she's got three boys [several inaudible words] to get into the computer and stuff like that.
L:  And then they have the kindergarten programs.
R:  But they're pretty smart, like they'll stand around here and they'll watch or else like -- or the first two will get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like the first two numbers and then the second, you know, ones will get the last two numbers.  So, they'll end up figuring it out anyway.
L:  So, they get the code.
R:  But, yeah, like -- I don't know.  For me personally I -- I -- kids have to be monitored with that kinda stuff because it is quite --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some are quite rude, you know, guns and like the blood and how they beat up women and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are they?  So, do you have to be a certain age to rent them?
L:  Yeah.  Like Vice City and [inaudible] and all those games are really bad.  Yeah, for littler kids.
R:  So, there's like, um, warnings, there's discretions on the, uh, pieces when you're like renting them?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I just think a caution.  Yeah.  It'll say like -- it'll -- it's rating, like T. or --
R:  Oh, really?

R:  You guys are like totally addicted.
L:  -- and I play it nonstop.  I have everything -- like expansion things of that game --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and we're about to make another one.
R:  I guess it's better than drugs.
L:  Like, me and my friend are about to create another one for them.  Yeah.  That is how obsessed.
R:  Yeah.  That's good.
L:  It -- it is addicting.
R:  Well, it's ...
L:  I'm really addicted to that game.
R:  Is it all over yet or what?
L:  But you couldn't -- yeah.  I don't --
R:  Are ya?

R:  Yep.
L:  I have no idea.  We're watching Ben Wilder.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  We've just turned it on.
R:  What else can we say about video games?
L:  Maternity Ward.  I don't know -- is that on P.S.A.?  Yeah.  I love Trading Places and While You Were Out.
R:  Do you spend a lotta money on video -- like, do you buy or do you get it as a gift?
L:  Yeah.  That was a design thing.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Um, I don't buy 'em.
R:  Are they expensive to buy?
L:  I get -- I've gotten every one except like the first one as a gift.  Like, I don't buy 'em, like ...
R:  Like the start up pack?  Yeah.
L:  I'll tell her maybe I want this and I'll watch her -- I'll watch my step Mom's two kids and she'll surprise me when she comes home with it every time a new one comes out.
R:  Well, like that's where you build the cities, right?
L:  Well, the first one is like fifty nine dollars 'cause it's -- it's the thing that starts it out.  It's the -- yeah, it's the whole game.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But then the other ones are just extension packs, like upgrades --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- and those are twenty nine.
R:  My girlfriend has it.
L:  Right.
R:  But I've never played it.
L:  Well, no, that's -- this is you build a hou-, like you make a household with people and you run their lives and you get 'em a job, you earn money, you buy 'em stuff.  Basically it's like a doll house, like an interactive doll house, and then like -- it's really addicting and they have, uh --
R:  So, you are them, but in the computer?
L:  -- now -- now the new one's just come out --
R:  You can tell everything that they do?
L:  -- it's Super Star.  You can be, um --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- like a model --
R:  I'm gonna try it.
L:  -- an actor or --
R:  See, I could do something like that.
L:  -- a rock star and then like they have a vacation where you get to go to like the mountains, the beach or just like camping.  Right.  Basically, yep.
R:  Yeah.  That'd -- that'd be a wee bit better than the other one.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's -- it's the only one I get into.  I can't get into any of the roller coaster tycoon.  I love those games.  Like, I like the Sim games like where you have to like manage things --
R:  Like what about Pac Man?
L:  -- and organize and control and I like that kinda stuff.
R:  I asked -- I asked for like a Nintendo back then and I asked -- I just wanted it.  I'm an only child.  So, whatever I asked for I kinda got.
L:  Um, it was this -- I got a computer.
R:  So, I got it and I ...
L:  I think Mario Brothers was the first game I played on -- on Nintendo.  I'm an only child.
