R:  That is neat.  Yeah.  My mother was, uh --
L:  So, yeah.
R:  -- a mathematician. 
L:  I don't know how we talk about this for ten minutes, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  However, I'm terrible at math, but she's good.  Yeah.  No.  I get most of my news from the T.V. and from my best friend because she's the one that reads the papers and if she comes up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, she like saves little items for me.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's neat.  My mother in law does that.  She's always, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.

R:  Oh, that would be good.
L:  You must read, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My mother sends [inaudible].  Do you have a computer?
L:  Yes.  I have a computer.
R:  You have no T.V., but a computer?  Okay.

L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  [LAUGH]  Well, we -- when we were going out we figured out that we have like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- really different, um, tastes [LAUGH] and, uh, we're -- we're both the, uh -- the --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- remote hogs.  So, we were not going to get along [LAUGH] if we had a T.V.
R:  That's what my mother does.
L:  Yeah.  Either that or we were just going to have existences, you know, like one T.V. in one room and the other in the other [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because, uh, he likes, uh, sports, cooking shows and, um --
R:  Mhm.

R:  Yeah.  You need two [several inaudible words] and earphones.
L:  So ...
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- I understand that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you know, 'cause I didn't have T.V. for a long time and I didn't miss it really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But then I could work a lot better too.  So ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, I have, uh, the degenerate -- I'm only fifty --
L:  What do you have?
R:  -- and I have the degenerative osteoarthritis of a seventy five year old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's kinda painful.
L:  Ah.

L:  Oh, that's a shame.  It's real painful.
R:  Yeah.  So, that was donated to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm happy.
L:  Well, that's a shame.
R:  I get -- I get around more than I used to that's for sure.
L:  Well, that's fun.
R:  I can go down to the park.
L:  Uh ...
R:  Yes.  I do.
L:  Do you -- yeah, do you have a computer?  That's -- yeah.  Do you, um -- I -- my, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my father in law was just, um -- he was like an email freak.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He -- he had -- I would get five or six emails a day from him and it was always from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was always like, um -- it was -- you know, some things were like current events and, you know, articles that he found and others were like jokes and stuff like that, but he had like a whole --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- network of people that he was like broadcasting these to all over the country --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, it kept him in touch with everybody and he passed away like a couple of months ago --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and a whole -- his whole network of people when they stopped getting emails started to worry and -- and, you know, then of course they knew that he had gone.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Um, but it was, uh --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- yeah, my email box is a little bit smaller now.
R:  Positive thoughts kinda thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Which is nice.
L:  But, uh ...
R:  'Cause she knows I'm a -- a -- a good sort in general, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I read 'em.  Mostly I don't have time to be depressed anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, basically [inaudible], um, good crime, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I like some of the --
L:  What do you like to read?
R:  -- the [inaudible], you know?  Anything but, um, westerns --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, what other ...?  Oh, romance, I don't read those [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or historical novels or any of that kinda stuff.  I would sit in a room but, you know, I don't really [COUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I can't understand people that read that stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I think well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they probably can't understand what you read.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- fair enough.
L:  But somebody has to buy it.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  No.  I know.  [LIPSMACK] Um, yeah, I, uh --
R:  Left Behind?
L:  -- I don't get to read, uh, um, too many -- too many books.  I've been into that -- my husband and I are, uh -- have gotten into that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, Left Behind series --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and -- yeah.  Um, that --
R:  Mm.  I don't think I've ever noticed that.
L:  -- it's, um -- it's like, um [LIPSMACK] -- it's -- it's like, uh --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- like end time prophecy thing.  But it's like fiction, you know --
R:  You read magazines?
L:  -- and it's, uh -- it was on the bestsellers list for -- for a while.
R:  And it's so old.
L:  Yeah.  It's real, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it is -- it's neat but, um, mostly we just read, um, magazines and stuff.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I prefer National Geographic.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But, um ...
R:  Well, and I get the New Yorker or actually --
L:  Yeah.  I like, um --
R:  -- a friend of mine gets it and then as soon as she's read it she passes it down to me.
L:  -- uh, yeah, I get a -- I get a lotta current event type stuff --
R:  So, I get to read that and that's fine.
L:  -- from like National Review and it's --
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  -- it's more in depth.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a lot more in depth than, you know, like you get on T.V. or in the newspaper and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it keeps -- you make sure you actually read it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's what my -- my mother in law does with the National Review.  So, we cheat on the subscription I guess, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then, you know, the rest will be oh, did you read the one on this?
R:  'Cause you take the quiz, right?  [LAUGH]  That sounds like a kick.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, every time -- yeah, that's the thing.  That's the thing about all --
R:  Except for you're not old.  You're --
L:  -- the little articles and stuff it's always like --
R:  -- let me guess, forty two?
L:  -- what did you think about it?  And then I've gotta --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I have to -- I know when I get 'em I have to read 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I'm gonna be quizzed on them later and ...  [LAUGH]
R:  I figure once you get to forty two if you don't figure it out by then there's something definitely wrong with you.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's true.
R:  So ...  Oh, I was a --
L:  I'm thirty nine.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I worked for answering services.
L:  Do you really?  Very good.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's like I cleaned the business of seven hundred nurses basically, but it was -- it's fun because it went fast.  Yeah.  Doctors' offices employing companies --
L:  Yeah.  What did you do before you were disabled?
R:  -- just like everything.  It was kind of -- it was fun and it wasn't anything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um -- it keeps your mind occupied and I don't -- I go crazy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I don't have something to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to occupy my mind.  That's one of the reasons I watch T.V. --
L:  I bet.  Yeah.  Doctors' offices and stuff like that.  Yeah.
R:  I forgive me.  Watch the news too.  Uh, well, the news, watch Channel Nine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is our, um, public broadcasting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I watch, uh -- any time I get opera, theater, anything like that I watch that.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that stuff.  I don't know what else.  Oh, I watch a few of those sitcoms --
L:  Do you, um -- what do you like to watch?
R:  -- like, um -- I like Will and Grace and Frazier, but you don't know what I'm talking about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  Good.  [LAUGH]  All right.  I don't know [inaudible].  [PAUSE]  That's pretty cool.  I just saved for a little T.V. for Christmas and hide out in the other room.
L:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
R:  Actually you get T.V. through your --
L:  But now those are all in the fashion.
R:  -- uh, computer, they're supposed to be able to work.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know how that works.
L:  So, I --
R:  Mine's not really new either.
L:  -- I go over to my friend's house --
R:  It's a nineties.  So --
L:  -- and, you know, my husband's not there.  I -- you know, I get the --
R:  -- ninety seven or eight.
L:  -- the channel changer.  So, it's okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  My grandmother gave it me or I'd never been able to afford it.
L:  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Hmm?  Oh, no, she was.  Yeah.  She died.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- her thing was that she wanted --
L:  Mine -- mine's like a dinosaur.  So ...
R:  -- to give something to each of her grandkids before she died.  So that, you know, she wouldn't have to worry ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Your grandmother's still alive.  That's great.  So, your grandmother's still alive.  That's great.  Um ...
