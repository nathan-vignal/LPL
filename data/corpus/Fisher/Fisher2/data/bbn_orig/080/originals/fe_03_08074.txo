L:  Hi, is Audrey King.  How are you?
R:  Oh, pretty good.  This is Kim.
L:  Um, nice to hear your voice.
R:  Um, so have you done this thing before?
L:  I've done it one time and that was like, um, maybe a month ago.  What about yourself?
R:  Um, no, I never have before.
L:  And, uh, my understanding was you complete three calls.  So, I don't know what's going on really.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know either with it and ...
L:  But I enjoy it, you know?  I always enjoy talking over the phone.  You can't lose for, um -- for ten minutes.
R:  Oh, no.  That's what I figure too.
L:  And don't we get like ten bucks if we stay on?
R:  That's what --
L:  Are you in ...?
R:  -- that's what I understood.  That's why I'm wondering if -- you know, if it actually works and all that.
L:  Well, we'll find out won't we --
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, we will.
L:  -- 'cause this is my second?  Have you ever done it?
R:  No.  I haven't.  This is the first time.
L:  Well, this is my second one.  So, perhaps they're trying to wait until I reach the three and they're giving me the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause my understanding that was the timeframe.  But I have quarter to four.  Are you in Philly?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, you can tell I have kids here.  Sorry.  [LAUGH]  Is what?
L:  Are you in Philadelphia?
R:  No.  I'm in Nebraska.
L:  I'm in Philadelphia, P.A.  That should be interesting.  So, how do you keep up with current events?  Mostly I read the paper every day.
R:  Um ...
L:  I read about two papers --
R:  That's -- yep --
L:  -- newspapers.
R:  -- we read the regular paper.
L:  Two ...
R:  Oh, I don't really -- I don't really watch the news too much.
L:  Well, I -- I watch the news, um, very sporadically, but it's so hard because it's a matter of being in front of the T.V. at a certain time.
R:  [NOISE] See, and I have little ones so we're always watching cartoons and ...
L:  Well, my thing, like I said, you know, it comes on at certain times and I'm usually occupied doing something else, like early morning I'm working out.  So, you're not gonna interfere with my workout -- from T.V. -- that I enjoy.  That's one of the main reasons and, like I said, I get someone that brings me the two local papers every day.
R:  See ...
L:  A friend of mine.
R:  And see -- and that's mine, just drink some coffee in the morning and read my paper.
L:  Well, I don't get -- he don't bring it to me 'til afternoon and as a matter of fact I'm just leafing through it now and, um, let me see.  As far as the news I try to catch it maybe once or twice a week, but my main choice would be, um, the -- the, uh, newspaper, two local papers every day, that's like seven days, and talking to my neighbors.  I have an elderly neighbor and a couple, you know, middle aged people that I converse with, especially if it's something hot in the news and we wanna share, you know, thoughts on it.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And the older generation's pretty good with keeping up on [LAUGH] -- on current events.
L:  Well -- well -- well, as a matter of fact we had, um, Laura Bush come down my street the other day and I was told by another neighbor who just wanted to just seem like she knew -- she didn't mean any harm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she said it was Hillary Clinton.  It turned out it was Laura Bush and my neighbor confirmed because he sits up there with his paper every morning at least by eight.  So, you can depend on -- I could walk out at any time and ask him.  So, that's my second avenue.  But, you know, I don't really talk to him every day.  It's more so what I read --
R:  Yeah.  See and ...
L:  -- and it's -- it's weird that I have to read stuff like twice before I get an understanding sometimes.  I usually come out with the wrong information.
R:  See, and I'm more with just local current -- you know, current events.  Not too much -- yeah, I mean, I read over the national, but I'm not hip on what's going on or anything.
L:  Can you hear something beeping?  That's just my other line and I'm not going to answer that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- 'cause I'm concerned how -- you know, not so much the money, but if they told us when we signed up -- and I've been waiting to see if I was gonna get at least ten bucks -- I don't know how it worked -- but I completed one ten minute ...
R:  See, and when they first started calling we thought they were asking will -- will you accept charges?
L:  No.
R:  And had hung up the phone, but then when I listened and said no, will you accept, you know [NOISE], just the call ...
L:  No.  No.  No.
R:  So, we're not getting charged any long distance or ...?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're not getting nothing like that and, see, it comes through the, uh, University of Pennsylvania and they are pretty reliable.  Um, it's a thing where I could like take one bus and go down there and find out what's going on, but I see the study advertised in local malls a lot and I had actually forgot about it and I happened to be near the phone today.  As a matter of fact I just came in the house.  So, I think it's a, uh, completion of three calls.  I don't know how it works.  They gave us a number.  Remember?  Didn't they give you some kind of number?
R:  Uh, yes, um, yeah.  That had letters in it.  Some kinda -- and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that.
L:  I don't even have -- well, it may not actually use it, which it -- it didn't.  They probably just go by our phone numbers when they called us.
R:  Okay.  'Cause I don't even know where [LAUGH] -- where that is anymore.
L:  Well, we better stay to the topic.  We've been on here like four minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Luckily I have a -- a digital clock right in front of me and, um, you know, once again they wanted to know how we keep up on current events.  I -- I -- I ...
R:  See, you know, and that's all I do and a lot of the other current ones I don't really, like I said ...
L:  Well, just remember too we've got to stay on ten minutes to get paid now.  We got to speak some more.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I don't want you to just, um ...
R:  No.  No.  I was just saying with current events that's just how I -- you know, just the paper and otherwise our cartoons are on.  So, I don't really listen too much and whether --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- then I have a little scanner.  So, I just listen to that.
L:  No radio?  No radio?  You don't use that?
R:  Um, yeah, a little bit.  Not too much.  I'm usually pretty busy.
L:  Yeah.  Like I said, I -- I -- I -- if -- if I have a program on already of course I'm not gonna turn off the -- the news, um, because I -- I often have made jokes.  I've said the only reason I watch the news -- it's so violent anymore --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- is because it could be [LAUGH] my next door neighbor that's a serial killer and they're looking for him.  I mean, there has been occasion that there has been like a murderer, like Gary Hynick[?], you ever heard of him?
R:  Uh-uh.  No.
L:  He's a serial killer and he was killing a lotta women and I happen to be in McDonalds a lot and that's where he was picking these --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- these girls were retarded.  So, you see, not that that's so much like it's a next door neighbor, but it really made you realize how close you could've been to being a part of that whole thing.  He was so clever.  But these girls were from like a mental institution that he prayed on --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he had an accomplish.  He was such a weirdo.  He -- they ended up, um, electrocuting him and he said he wanted to die towards the end.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  That's a crock -- that's a bunch of mess.  He didn't wanna die.  He wanted them to spare his life and he had taken so many lives --
R:  See, and I'm --
L:  -- and these wom- ...
R:  -- I'm pretty like -- you know, I guess news wise too, you know?  I live in such a small community that I suppose that's how.
L:  You said Nebraska?
R:  Yeah.  And, uh, the town I live in has like six hundred people in it and there's a lotta small little towns around.  So ...
L:  You ever been to Philadelphia?
R:  No.  I never have.
L:  Well, I would say it's thousands here.  Come on now, you know?
R:  Oh, boy!  See, you know, and this is such a small community [NOISE] too that you could drive to the neighboring town and most people know everybody.  So, I mean --
L:  Well -- well --
R:  -- so I guess that's ...
L:   -- I -- I don't even know the people on my block 'cause a lotta new people are in here and I even said to one of my neighbors I said maybe I oughta leave it that way 'cause sometimes when you start talking to 'em you wish you never had.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yep.  And it's even worse in a smaller community where ...
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes you say you wanna leave well enough alone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like my block right now a lotta people have moved out, parents left them the home and they ended up selling it and the -- the -- the -- the new people -- I hate to come down on 'em -- they're so rude and loud and, you know, they don't control their children and you think -- you don't wanna say I'm petty or picking at 'em -- but it's a reality.
R:  And -- and you don't wanna say anything --
L:  I don't know where these peop- ...
R:  -- or -- yeah, then they -- if they retaliate and [MN].
L:  No.  I -- I -- I try -- you know what?  Like my -- I -- I live with my sisters right now.  Uh, my Mom passed and this is her home.  We've been here thirty six years.  I'm forty eight years old by the way and ...
R:  Okay.  I'm thirty three.
L:  Thirty three.  Okay.  And, um, it's just a thing where, you know, I just -- I just look at how my neighborhood has changed.  I mean, these kids literally come out and swing from the trees.  You're wondering where the heck you are --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and the parents are right there.
R:  See, and I grew up out in the country.  I'm not used to small -- even small town living with neighborhoods and I'm used to going outside, having my own space and, uh, I don't like the town stuff.
L:  Well, trust me, if you bickering with your neighbor here you're in trouble 'cause you're almost nose to nose with 'em when you open your door.
R:  Oh.  That would be hard.  That would be really hard.
L:  And, you know, another thing that I wanted to stress.  As -- as far as the Fisher study I'm into research.  I have a bachelor of science degree from, um, uh, a catholic college since nineteen seventy.  I enjoy research.  I've done a lotta market research and I'm -- I'm -- I'm very interested.  It's not just so much the ten bucks, which would be good --
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  -- you know, I mean, for talking over the phone doing something you enjoy and meeting new people.  It's very nice 'cause the other lady I talked to -- my first time I told you was about a month ago -- 'cause they gave me a timeframe to be home.  They could be calling me, but I don't think so 'cause I've been home.
R:  See, and they had called one other time, but I ended up staying on the line for quite a while 'cause they were trying to find a participant.  So, I finally -- I finally hung up.
L:  Well, that's not the case here.  Um [LIPSMACK], each time they came right on with somebody, like you --
R:  See, and this is the first time.
L:  -- you see how fast -- you weren't on there long, were you?
