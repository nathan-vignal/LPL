L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name is Christie.
L:  This is Wanda.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um [LAUGH], so how do you get your information?
L:  Um, Internet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- newspaper, news.
R:  Yeah.  I ...
L:  Just about anywhere.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I'm a stay at home Mom.  So, I -- I depend more on the, uh, Internet I think, you know?  But at least with Netscape, what I have, sometimes it doesn't always have the highlighted new stories.  So, you just kinda have to get what takes -- you know --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I --
R:  -- catches your eye.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- use -- go through A.O.L. and they don't either.
R:  I know.  I -- I used to have them, but it -- they usually cover some things.  So, it's just a matter of what catches your eye.  But, I mean, if I really wanted to know everything I could, you know, go to one of the news station website I'm sure and find all the links, you know?
L:  Yeah.  There you go.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You can go on them and get pretty much anything.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Sometimes I get tired of seeing some of this news stuff [LAUGH], uh ...
L:  Yeah.  When the war was going on it just drove me nuts.
R:  Mhm.  But it's -- it's like they gotta fill it with junk now.  I was on there earlier just checking to see what had changed.  You know, they had the serious stuff, like this kid who's been killed and then -- and then they have little articles like, you know, what celebrity's insure on their bodies.  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  So ...
L:  -- like we care what they insure.
R:  I guess they have to do something to spark your reading interest.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I seen one on there this morning.  I can't remember now what it was.  Something about alcohol and violence in one of 'em's home and I was like well, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they all do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's nothing that we can do to stop it.  If they lived just like us --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they just have more money than what we got.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I don't know.  It seems like a lotta people spend more time with the Internet to get their news or else the newspaper or, you know, if they go to work obviously the radio if -- if it's at work or, um, you know, talking to people at work.  But I know for myself we don't have cable T.V. now 'cause it's cheaper to get the dish.  So, sometimes you just don't -- you know, when you're watching T.V. -- at least when I am -- I don't really go to the local channels because I know I can go look on my computer at my convenience instead of having to sit and wait for the news to come on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  About the only time I really listen to the local news is, um, right before I go bed every night and early in the morning.
R:  Mm.
L:  Other than that I don't listen to it that much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we -- we have the dish too.  We don't have local cable.  The dish, uh -- well, we've got [inaudible] T.V. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, I mean, it's a lot better.  You don't have the problems and the headaches that you do with cable.
R:  Yep.  We changed over because our cable just started getting so much more expensive and it was like well, we can get the same thing cheaper.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, we get over nine hundred channels for forty dollars a month --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and we hardly ever lose our satellite dish.
R:  You must not live where it rains very much?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, uh, we're out in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh.  We're in Florida and we've been getting a lotta rain down here and when we that -- that -- thunderstorms it'll go out, but it's really not -- it's not that bad honestly, you know?  It ...
L:  We gotta lotta rain here a while back and this one didn't do that bad.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it -- it wasn't really the rain.  It was the thunderstorm.  But I know because of that -- now, see, that I got to where I was watching -- I was with my Mom for a while in Cape Coral and it was flooding so bad down there and my husband had driven down to visit while I was down there with her and he couldn't get to us because the roads were being closed off.  So, we're, you know, there of course.  We were trying to watch T.V., you know, the weather channel, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I suspect that's one of the top used channels now, you know, that so many people watch 'cause it's on all the time, you know?
L:  Yeah.  A lotta people like that weather channel.  My phone's just crackling.  They were supposed to come and fix it today and they never made it out to fix it.
R:  Oh, well, mine's always messed up.  The phone company won't believe that there's something wrong with ours.  So, I don't even worry about it anymore.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  The -- the -- these places anymore -- ain't nothing reliable.
R:  No.
L:  I've been fighting with A.O.L. because I keep losing my connection on -- on the Internet.
R:  Hmm.
L:  I've been fighting with the phone company.
R:  Have you thought about doing like the D.S.L. or cable hook up or something?
L:  Yeah.  We want to eventually.  Just right now we're just -- you know, we're not gonna do it right now.
R:  Mm.
L:  We're trying to find a bigger place to live.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  We -- my husband went ahead and did that.  Even though it was more expensive we did it with the cable company, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I tell ya, it's -- it's a lot better than waiting for it to go through sometimes.  I mean, you know, if you really like to get your stuff fast.  So, hopefully the prices on that'll come down, but it'll probably be another fifty years before it does.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't understand why they want such outrageous prices for it anyway.
R:  'Cause it's a novelty.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's ...
L:  I told that lady today -- well, yesterday -- I said, you all wanna satisfy your customers -- I said, you don't satisfy me by giving me credit for my last three weeks of aggravation.
R:  Oh, there's a word -- that's why we quit with them.  We went with, um -- who have we got now?  Netscape I guess -- it's a M.S.N. -- I don't even know who we went with to tell you the truth.  Oh, yeah, our cable company.  I'm so out of it.  Anyway, um, we got tired of fooling with A.O.L. and they kept trying to charge and so stuff and my husband finally called them.  He said, "You're gonna have to take this off our bill" and he finally, you know, got bull headed enough with 'em that he worked up to about the third manager up and finally got somebody, you know, that said, "No.  That's wrong.  This can be reimbursed".  But they're a real hard nut to crack.  My Mom had problems with 'em too.  So, they're not all they come out to be I don't think.
L:  Yeah.  They said -- they said when we go to cancel we'll have a hard time doing it.
R:  If you do it before your next billing cycle you should be able to, you know, like if you know it's gonna be -- I don't know -- you'll have to look at your billing cycle thing and find out, you know?  You -- it'll be okay if you lose four or five days on it, but like if you wait the first day of the next month well, you're pretty much gonna have to fight over getting it back.  They're gonna charge you for the whole month even though you don't use it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or else they'll make you use it.  So, you've got that and whatever new thing you get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is a real pain in the butt 'cause you don't need two.  So, that would be my advise on that is just to keep hounding at 'em, you know, keep asking for a manager and time it, you know, a little better.
L:  Well, that's what I thought I was gonna have to do yesterday was call and get a manager on the phone.
R:  Yeah.  I would keep doing that.  But even then they get a little agg- agg- aggravating.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  My son he answered the phone.  I was lying down.  I said who is it?  He said I don't know 'cause I haven't got one of these calls for a long time.
R:  I know.  That's what I was thinking too.  I was sitting here watching T.V. and I got a call from, you know, the mortgage company that, you know, wanna sell you stuff.  I hung up on them.  I thought maybe it was my husband calling and I'm like Fisher, oh, okay.  I figured they weren't ever gonna call me back.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's what I thought too.
R:  Well, you can call -- or at least I had a thing where I could call in and do it, but I just really haven't been up to it.  So -- but hey, I think I can handle somewhat current events I think.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, this is my fourth call I've done for 'em I think since February.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I don't find it that hard.
R:  No.  No.  Actually I think you're right.  I've done three or four.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So far I've been paid for one and I'm thinking surely here soon in the next few weeks or so I should be getting that bigger paycheck.  So, this would be my third call.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was pleased that at least they -- they did pay, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how did you hear about it?  Online then or ...?
L:  Yeah.  Online.
R:  Maybe ...
L:  When I hang out on the message board.
R:  Mm.  I still haven't figured out how to work those things for the life of me yet and I've got -- I've got a little baby too and I -- you know [LAUGH], you get them around and you can't figure anything out.  You just ...
L:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I get on the message boards and of course when I was there when I first started on 'em I couldn't figure 'em out, but now that I've been doing it for a year I just go anywhere and everywhere.
R:  Hmm.
L:  What I have a hard time with is if I'm trying to find something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't never find it.
R:  Yeah, or if you find too much about it or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's been my problem.  [LAUGH]  I know when I used to work and have the Internet, I mean, I was always checking the news.  I don't know.  It just seemed easier to access for some reason, like more of the information links were there and it just seems like now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here I am at home with all this time and I -- I can't find anything to look at [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, worth looking at, you know, and it's like well, you know, I've got better things to do than sit in front of the computer.  Run around the floor.  My daughter just learned how to walk.  So, that's pretty funny.
L:  Yeah.  You got a tiny, tiny one.  My baby will be eleven in August.
R:  [LAUGH] Mine's eleven months.
L:  If you, uh, go to, uh, big --
