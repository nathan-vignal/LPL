R:  Kelly.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Susan.
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, I'm calling from the Los An- -- I'm from the Los Angeles area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, no, I do not play computer games, but ...
R:  I know.  Me either.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What shall we talk about?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I -- so, I can't say that I do it on C.D. Rom or over the Internet or what's my favorite.  My fourteen year old son is addicted.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I do buy them all the time.
R:  Okay.  Then you know some.  I don't know any.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well [LAUGH], yeah.  Okay.  So, we're supposed to talk for ten minutes?
R:  I mean, we don't have a Sega.  We don't have anything.
L:  No.  I know.
R:  Um ...
L:  I mean, I can tell you -- I can't even think of the ones, you know, that he likes.  He writes them down on a list for Christmas and birthdays.  Some are horrid, bad.  I hear that, you know, you have to -- p- parental guidance.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I'm sure he has all of those.
R:  The only ones I know about are the ones that are like, you know, um -- the Matrix and stuff like that, anything that has a movie to it.
L:  Right.
R:  But I've never, ever played any of 'em.
L:  I don't either.
R:  Never bought one.  Nope.
L:  Mario Brothers.  I think when they first came out or -- and my son got a, um -- a -- whatever --
R:  Delta Com.
L:  -- a Nintendo sixty four, I ...
R:  Yeah, way back then.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  I attempted.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it wasn't for me.
R:  No.  I can't even [LAUGH] -- I can remember the Atari and that was way back --
L:  Oh, okay.  I remember that too.
R:  -- and they didn't even have computer games.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When they used to Pong and Frogger.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, I remember those too.
R:  And I used to play those, but ...
L:  And Pac Man.
R:  Yeah.  Pac Man.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Centipede.
L:  Oh, Centipede.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's right.
R:  And, um -- oh, my God, there was Pac Man ...
L:  I mean, those were like -- they even had 'em in the bars, you know?  I mean, that was like the big thing.
R:  That was ancient.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, boy, what a topic is this!
R:  I know.  I was like what?
L:  Now, if you had my son on here he would be ...
R:  He could just talk forever. 
L:  Oh, yeah.  He'd never shut up about it.
R:  Mm.  I have a computer, but no games.
L:  I have a computer.
R:  I have a cell phone --
L:  Uh, I have ...
R:  -- no games.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- well, there are games on mine, but my kids play them.  I couldn't even tell ya how to --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- get in on it.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  On the computer when I first got it I played Solitaire.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I'd -- I'd actually say I've played Solitaire, not well, but I've played it.
L:  Yeah.  And that was it and then that was the end of that gaming for me on the computer.
R:  I think I actually played Memory.  Now I think about it I did play a little bit of -- I didn't know what I was doing [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, um, Memory, you know the memory game, remember the one with the cards --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- flip 'em over.
L:  Oh, that's right.
R:  I've played that one.
L:  Oh, I think I tried that too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, okay.
R:  That's about it.
L:  Is that a computer game?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I played them on the computer.  I did.  At work.  And I remember --
L:  [LAUGH] At work.
R:  -- it was a long time ago.  So ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I can't even fake this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Blank.
L:  Well, I know because we don't do it.  Now, I can tell you the systems --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she's asking, um -- well, C.D. Rom or over the Internet.  So, really that's total computer as opposed to, you know, the Nintendo sixty four's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we do have a stack of those.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think I just got something, but I don't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't even use the C.D. Rom.
R:  I know.  Me either.
L:  I'm total worldwide web, you know?
R:  I use the Internet and that's it.
L:  Yeah.  That's it.  Okay.  Well ...
R:  Check my mail and -- and search for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or shop online.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, all right.  We can do those things too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Nothing to do with computer games.  Sorry.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well ...
R:  Although I -- I have heard that the Matrix game is pretty good as far as games go.
L:  Well, there's a few I know that you have to pay to get in and you ...
R:  What? 
L:  Oh, yeah.  You pay and then you're on -- I guess you can play against other people across the nation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I -- I mean, I just only wish that I had invented that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because this one guy I know makes tons of -- he was an attorney.  He bought the rights to some game and of course he's extremely wealthy now.
R:  Of course.  [LAUGH]
L:  But that isn't me either.
R:  If you only had that one idea.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, I'm trying to think.  It's funny 'cause we just talked about getting a Sega or whatever the heck the current thing is, cube or whatever, and to -- to actually go into that world of games --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- as adults.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you have no children?
R:  So, we don't have any kids and, um, we were like nah, we don't need that do we?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We have T.V.  Shit --
L:  Right.  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know what I mean?  That -- that -- that'll monopolize your time right there.  What do we need Sega for and all that stuff?  I barely can enjoy a D.V.D.  So, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm just like okay, it looks like it's a little bit better than what the V.C.R. used to -- I mean, V.C.R. tapes used to be, you know, the V.H.S.?
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't see that ...
L:  All right.  We're, uh -- I guess we're supposed to talk, what is it, ten minutes?
R:  Ten minutes.  Yes.
L:  Okay.  How many have passed?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I -- I usually look over.  I didn't look over this time.
L:  [LAUGH] I didn't either.
R:  Um, I'm trying to think what else is on video, but I can honestly say I don't know anything about it.  Wow!  Easy to talk about anything too.
L:  Oh, me too, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not this.
R:  Mm.
L:  Computer games, C.D. Rom, I'm trying to think of anything.
R:  And you know what?  The only ones I know, like I said, was the movies, but Tomb Raider, the Lara Croft series.
L:  Oh, well ...
R:  I've never played it, but I've seen, you know, her running through whatever, or there's one I always see on M.T.V.  It's, um [LIPSMACK], the Simpsons or something --
L:  Oh, maybe --
R:  -- and just --
L:  -- and my son has something like ...
R:  -- just the commercial, I've only seen the commercial.
L:  Well, he has something like civilizations where you put them together.  He has, uh, Sim City.  Those are these computer things and I have watched him because he builds a home --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and these little people move all around in the house and the --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- man goes off and the woman off to their jobs and you can have children, you can build a pool in the back yard.  So, I have noticed this little, um, thing --
R:  Oh, maybe that's the -- the Sims or something like that.
L:  Sims.
R:  Sims.
L:  Yes.  And --
R:  That's it.  That's it.  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they have a roller coaster --
R:  That one actually looks ...
L:  -- tycoon --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he does -- I notice and you have to have little people pay --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you can build this roller coaster.  I don't know.  Like I said, it's glancing over his shoulder very rarely.
R:  [LAUGH] It's a whole another world.
L:  It's -- it is.  It's a whole another world that some people just know everything about.
R:  Yeah.  And I really don't.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  What else?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um [COUGH], I'm trying to think.  Mm.
L:  [PAUSE] What city are you calling from?
R:  Oh, New York, New York City.
L:  Oh, so we're coast to coast.  Okay.
R:  Yep.
L:  Coast to coast --
R:  Total op- ...
L:  -- each end --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and doesn't know anything about computer games.
R:  I know.  It's that a match?  [LAUGH]  Maybe we can fake it, you know?  Oh, yeah, I've heard about that.  Nope.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You don't have a New York accent.
R:  No, because I'm from Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.  I moved here like five years ago and, uh, I don't even have --
L:  Now, I know --
R:  -- any friends who play computer games.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well, I know -- I don't either -- and you're -- actually you'll be, uh -- whenever you're going to a store you'll just kinda notice a computer game from now on and you'll go [LIPSMACK], "Well, I could've talked about that".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know?  But, um, I guess they won't be able to use much of this conversation for whatever.
L:  [LAUGH] For a study they'll go yeah, don't ever ...
R:  They really didn't know anything, did they?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well.  What can you do?  But, um, I definitely will go check out some computer games from now on.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't even have any nieces or nephews or anything around me that ...
L:  Oh, well, I do.  I know they all want them.  But like, again, that's the list --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I go to the store with the list --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I honestly don't know -- I -- my son wants D.S.L. lines because with that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there's certain computer games that you have -- because I noticed that at Christmas.  I went in there and he goes, "Do you have D.S.L.?" and I said no.  "Well, then you can't -- he can't play this game" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and almost his whole Christmas list was that.
R:  Oh, God!
L:  So, there went that and I don't even know the name of the ...
R:  Right out the window.
L:  But then he could've played with other people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever that is.
R:  Oh.  Totally lost.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Totally, totally lost.
L:  [LAUGH] See, I'm -- I'm talking about the fringes of computer games 'cause that's all I can --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- talk about.
R:  Oh, well [LAUGH], I'm sure you could download them though.  I know we can download music.  So, you gotta be able to download some of the games.
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  But I doubt for free 'cause I guess they can download it -- I can do the music -- it'd be free.
L:  Oh, yeah, well ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or you can burn someone else's maybe.
R:  Maybe.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You'd have to ask your son.  [LAUGH]  That's funny.  Well, I don't know if -- if they're gonna be like -- they can't even use this.
L:  I know.
R:  Sorry.
L:  So, we're trying to burn up ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Can't even burn up ten minutes.  That's for the first for me.
L:  I know.  But are we supposed to stay on for ten minutes, aren't we?
R:  Yeah.
