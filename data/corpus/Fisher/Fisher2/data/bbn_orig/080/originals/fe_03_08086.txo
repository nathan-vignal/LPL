L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Dawn.
L:  I'm Sarah.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good. [NOISE] I guess we're supposed to talk about current events? [NOISE]
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I get my current event news mostly online.  I don't have time to read the newspaper usually.
L:  I do too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um, I guess I go to CNN and MSNBC, I guess.
L:  [NOISE] I usually go to, like, our local channel and then just see what the local news is.
R:  Right.  Right.  Sometimes I go l- -- I live in, um -- near Boston so sometimes I go to, um, Boston Channel dot com.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  We used to live in Boston but we're --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we're in Maryland now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We were in Brookline.
R:  Oh.  I, ah, was there once. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It -- it was fun.  W- -- my husband and I both went to college in Boston and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we have many fond memories there. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  We love it there.  But --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- we're here now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, okay.  So, other than how we get our news [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what else are we supposed to talk about?
L:  I don't know.  The -- actually, this is the second time they called me today about current events so I've --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- run out [LAUGH] ...
R:  Did -- did you get that -- did you talk earlier?
L:  Yeah, I did.
R:  Oh, okay.  And what -- what were your -- what did you come up with?
L:  We were just talking about, like, you know, the state of the US right now and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he was a little bit unhappy so I was just, kinda, listening to [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]
L:  -- go off on, like, a whole tangent so --
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's good when --
L:  We were talking about, like, you know, who might be the new president and he was --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- hoping it would be better and ...  It's really interesting.  I have to say, it's really interesting talking to all these people.  I was talking to a man yesterday -- I -- I'm getting calls, like, twice a day now --
R:  Really?
L:  -- when I used to get, like, once a month --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I was talking to a man yesterday and it was so interesting and then it said, "You have thirty seconds left to talk" and we --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- were, like, nowhere near --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- talk- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- done talking [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and he's, like, "Oh, no, I don't wanna hang up" but then it, like, just cut you off.
R:  Right.
L:  And it was very funny.  I was, like, "Oh, well. [LAUGH] I guess that was that".
R:  Yeah.  If you get involved in a conversation it's hard to just stop --
L:  It --
R:  -- at end. [LAUGH]
L:  It really is.  What -- what do you do?
R:  Ah, I'm a graphic artist.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's cool.
R:  M- --
L:  I'm so +inartistically challenged.  I --
R:  Really?
L:  I'm always so -- I -- I just admire people who are good at art because I'm just so terrible.
R:  Well, I can't draw to save my life --
L:  Really?
R:  -- but [LAUGH] -- but I can use [LAUGH] the computer [LAUGH] to create things --
L:  That is so --
R:  -- just fine.
L:  And you can't draw at all?
R:  No.  No.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Stick figures. [LAUGH]
L:  That is amazing.  I just think of anyone who's, like, in the artistic field would be good, you know, at drawing and --
R:  Right, you would think so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But I'm not sure that -- that a majority of the people can draw actually.
L:  Isn't that interesting?
R:  Yeah.  Well, nowadays you just have to --
L:  Be able to use the --
R:  -- know the programs.
L:  -- program.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  That is -- that's really cool.
R:  And what do you do?
L:  I'm just a mom right now.
R:  Well, it's -- that's not just.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I was a teacher.  My husband and I both went to --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- school and studied to be teachers so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- once I got pregnant and had my first one, then that was it -- I haven't gone back since.
R:  Right.
L:  But I have three little boys --
R:  Oh.  That's --
L:  -- who are being --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- quite quiet at the moment. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, lucky for you.
L:  Yeah.  But it's really fun.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I really like it and, you know, I know eventually they'll all be grown up and I'll miss them so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I'm just enjoying time being a mom.
R:  Mhm.  Now, what did you teach?
L:  Um, I taught kindergarten.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, little kids.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I know all about these ages that I have now.
R:  That's -- that must have been enjoyable.
L:  It was.  It was really fun.  My husband and I were both nannies also for a very long time so it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was kinda like when we had our own kids it felt, like, so old hand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, we really messed up with everyone else's kids and then you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- have your own it's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, "Oh, this is easy". [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  It's not u- -- it's n- -- it's unusual that you have kids and you're all prepared for that sort of thing.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  You know, my -- my sister's having her first and she's just, like, so nervous and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- she's, like, never even held a baby and I'm just --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- like, "How do people go through life [LAUGH] ..."
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I babysat from when I was, like, eight years old.  I always loved kids and she never wanted to have anything to do with babysitting and I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm, like, "You know, this is what happens". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's -- it's, kind of, difficult that -- I mean, it's -- it's, sort of, strange that you just go to the hospital and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- and they plop a baby [LAUGH] in your arms --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- and now you're responsible for this little thing.
L:  That's what my sister said.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She, like, had a billion questions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I have three of them and so, you know, she's, like, "I have no idea what I'm doing".  I mean, she just no- -- I mean, just, like, she's nervous about labor, she had --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- no idea about pregnancy.  It's funny though; she hadn't felt the baby move and I was getting nervous because I said, you know, "You really should know by now" -- she's, like, six months now.
R:  Right.
L:  I said, "You really should've felt it".  She said, "I'm sure what I think I feel is indigestion" blah, blah, blah.  So, her husband says, "I felt the baby today before she did".
R:  Oh.
L:  I said, "What do you mean?"  He goes, "I'm lying on the couch with my hands on her stomach every night and I really felt a kick tonight" and I said, "Did you feel that?" and she's, like, "No".
R:  Oh.
L:  And he said, "Did you feel that?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And she's, like, "Oh, you think [LAUGH] that's the baby?"
R:  Ah.
L:  I mean, they're just -- they have no idea what they're doing.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So -- but it's too -- I mean, babies are born and you have no books or instruction --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- manuals or anything and it's, like, if you've never taken care of one, it's really scary.
R:  Right.  They, like --
L:  It's very scary.
R:  -- make you watch a h- -- a l- -- half hour video and, like, "Okay, you're ready to go --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- see ya".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's, like --
L:  I didn't even see that.
R:  "You must be joking?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  I -- I think it was on diapering your baby and cleaning them and whatever and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that was it.
L:  Okay.
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  That's funny.  Yeah.  And you -- how're you supposed to learn everything from that, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.  But it's fun.  I really like it.  I mean, it's exhausting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my boys just keep me running all day long.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Uh-oh, someone's calling me.  Hold on.
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Sorry.  There was no one there.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] that's okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Actually, when I was on hold waiting for someone to connect with me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I got a call waiting but it didn't tell me what it was and I thought maybe it was the -- the university system calling back.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] But -- but I couldn't figure out what it was.  You -- have you had to wait long for them to connect?
L:  Sometimes I've had to wait -- like, yesterday, it was, like, ten or fifteen minutes I was waiting and then I was -- and they said, "Do you wanna keep holding?"
R:  Mm.
L:  "Push one".  And then I was just, like -- after fifteen [LAUGH] minutes I said, "This is really getting ridiculous.  You know --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- I'm just hanging up".  But lately, like, the past four calls have been, like, five seconds.  Like, they must have had the other person and then they were just calling me --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- as the second person.
R:  Right.
L:  Because this -- when I just got connected with you it was, like, a quarter of a second.
R:  Oh.
L:  They were, like, "You're ready to talk".
R:  No.  I had, like, five minutes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I was thinking, "Should I hang up?  Should I not [LAUGH] hang up?"
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- luckily I h- -- my children were being quiet also so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- I -- I didn't --
L:  How --
R:  -- ha- --
L:  How old are your children?
R:  Ah, ten and five.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's great.
R:  One of each so ...
L:  That's nice.
R:  That was a nice little ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Got --
L:  Present for you? [LAUGH]
R:  Got it all done, you know?  Ah, two t- --
L:  That --
R:  Two tries.
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm, like -- I -- I'm trying to convince my husband I want a fourth.  I was, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- "I really want a girl".  He's, like, "Oh, my god, how could you want more?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'd say, "You're not home.  What do you care?" [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  He's, like, "Yeah, I guess". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that -- I -- all moms want a girl, don't they?
L:  It's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I so want a girl.  Like, all my girlfriends -- like, every girlfriend I have has all girls.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's just -- you know, their girls will come and sleep over and stuff, you know, if they're going away --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the minute they come in it's, like, "Okay, you're ready to do your nails --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- and get your hair braided".
R:  Mm.
L:  And it's, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my husband, says, "Enjoy yourself now.  You know, use these girls.  You can have them whenever you want".
R:  Right.
L:  But it's not the same though, you know?
R:  No.  But the girls clothes are so much cuter and ... [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Ah, my boys, it's, like -- and they love mud and bugs --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's, like, "I just wanna do tea parties and --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- you know, read a quiet book and play a quiet game".
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they don't understand what quiet is.  I mean --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- they're just each wilder than the next. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I just really want one.  I tell my husband, "Just one to stay home with me while you guys are all playing in the dirt".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he's, like, "Okay".  I mean, I've worn him down now because I've just [LAUGH] been annoying him so much.
R:  Oh.
L:  I know. [LAUGH] It's not nice.
R:  Be careful -- be careful what you wish for, you might get it.
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's true. [LAUGH] And then of course, all my girlfriends are, like, "You don't understand, girls are so moody, they're this ..."
R:  Oh.
L:  And I'm, like --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't -- I say, "I don't mind". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You just, kinda, roll your eyes and say, "Well, wait 'til they're eighteen". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Then you're in trouble.  Please.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know the -- the problems only get bigger.
R:  That's true.  That's what everyone tells me.  The l- -- the bigger they get, the bigger the problems.  So ...
L:  My oldest is only seven though so ...
R:  Mm.
L:  But the things he's been learning in camp, oh, my god.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm, like -- I wanna pull him out of camp it's so bad.
R:  Oh.  They learn --
L:  He's --
R:  -- things nowadays --
L:  He's really come home with a mouth and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's showing -- he says that his best friend showed him a middle finger.  He just put --
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  -- shows me the mi- -- he's, like, "I have no idea what that is".  I said, "Well, it's bad --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- don't do it". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's, like, "What is it exactly?"  I said, "Ask your dad --"
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  "-- when he comes home". [LAUGH] I don't even --
R:  Pass the buck.
L:  I don't even know where to start with that one.
R:  No.  They a- --
L:  But it's so bad.  I mean, this is all from just, like, a week of camp.  Oh, my god.
R:  Right.
L:  I can't take it.
R:  It sounds like we're getting old when we go, "Now, at their age, did we know these things?"
L:  I don't think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I did.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't think so either.
L:  He's only seven.  I mean, he just turned seven too -- he's so little.
R:  Mhm.  It's --
L:  But my god.
R:  Yeah.  It's scary nowadays.  Even in school, you know, and not even camp.  At school it's just --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- like, on the playground, all kinds of things.
L:  I mean, he used to love to read and then, like, he was in first grade this past year and I guess it wasn't cool to like to read this year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, he told me now he hates to read and it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so stupid and ...  And then I try and remind him that, you know, when you're playing a computer game or playing a video game, you're reading.  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "Did you see what the instructions said?"  He's, like, "Yeah, I guess so".  I said, "Well, is that cool to be able to know how to play the game?"
R:  Mm.
L:  He's, like, "Yeah, that's cool".
R:  Oh, that's a good angle.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll have [LAUGH] to remember that for a couple of years somehow. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, I mean, he realizes that everything he does he's reading.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like instructions on how to put a game together -- whatever it is, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's doing many cool things that require reading and he just doesn't realize it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He just thinks it's boring to choose a book that I choose and sit down --
