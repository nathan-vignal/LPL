R:  Hi, my name's Lorraine.
L:  [NOISE] Hi Lorraine, I'm Beth.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, good.
L:  That's good.  Oh, let's see [LIPSMACK], ah, I'd say I enjoy going to a movie theater, and the last movie I seen was, unfortunately, Finding Nemo.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, I don't go to the movies that often, um, I rather rent movies, but -- and I can't remember the last movie I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- saw, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unfortunate, I can't remember.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess it just depends [NOISE] on what kind of movie it is, if it's a bigger thea- -- like a big new theater and you like to see like the background and all that kind of stuff like that where can see -- like I'd say, like to make an example, like Titanic, you kind of need to see that in theaters --
R:  Right, [MN] --
L:  -- [NOISE] 'cause like th- the TV it was too small to watch.
R:  Right, I did see that in a theater.
L:  Yeah.  Um, so [NOISE] but y- --
R:  That was good.
L:  -- [NOISE] but yeah, I understand what you mean by wanting to rent movies usually at home because it does -- it's a little bit nicer and [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.  But, um, I don't know, I go -- probably go to the movies about maybe three, four times a year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, me and my husband, and sometimes we'll take the, um -- our family out.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah, most movies I see are for my family -- for my kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and stuff like that so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [NOISE] yeah, they're at the age where they can go so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or they at least will stay in their seats for long enough usually.  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah, mine are older and, um, and they like going to the movies and, um, like, we'll go with them a couple of times a year --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- but me and my husband go, um, the most -- I mean, when we do together --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, then we try different movie theaters to see, you know, what the theaters are like.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah, we just got a brand new one here and, so that was kind of neat to see that, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [NOISE] compared to what it used to look like and stuff like that.  But usually if we go to see movies, we usually go -- usually go like during the matinees and stuff like that so that's --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- [NOISE] 'cause they're getting pretty expensive.
R:  Yeah, it is --
L:  [NOISE] So.
R:  -- pretty expensive to go to the movie.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  That's why it's kind of nice to be able to rent it at home too.
R:  Mhm, I know, the last movie I wanted to see was Catch Me If You Can but --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- I didn't see it, so now I'm gonna get it -- try and get it on the video --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and watch that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I haven't seen the whole thing; I've seen bits and pieces though. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah [MN].
R:  [NOISE] Did it seem like it was any good?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, from what I -- the pieces that I've seen it would seem pretty good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yes, I think it would be definitely a better one to see at home 'cause it seemed kind of long so --
R:  Did it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, let me see --
L:  Try to think what --
R:  -- [NOISE] what else were we supposed to talk about?  The mov- -- ah, movies, tapes and what else?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I can't think what else you're supposed to say.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  Well, I think we've pretty much -- yeah, we said why we like to go to movies and -- and what k- -- type of movie we like to go.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  [NOISE] And the theaters, stuff like that so.
R:  [NOISE] Um.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] I haven't seen any kids movies.  My children are older, like I said, and they like going to the movies on their own --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty much now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, [NOISE] um ... we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do do a lot of renting and pay per view.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, yeah, pay for view's nice.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's not bad.
L:  No, huh-uh.  [NOISE] Yeah, we seem to try to rent a lot more kid movies so --
R:  [NOISE] Do you, so, yeah --
L:  -- if we --
R:  -- you're just really for the kids right now, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause it's hard --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to get our schedules together for us to go to the movies together so --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] I think the last time I did go -- I did go -- we went out for our anniversary in, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- March, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can't -- I -- I -- I can't even remember what movie it was I saw.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] That's a shame, so it must not have been that good. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's usually how it goes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Huh.
R:  Um.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And there's not anything out new that I want to see too much.  The last thing, like I said, I wanted to see, um, Catch Me If You Can --
L:  You Can, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, on the night, ah, I think we were going to go see it, I forget what happened, I think that they had the -- the time.  It wasn't running the time we were gonna go --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- [NOISE] and we ended up seeing something else --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  [NOISE] I can't even --
R:  -- that's about it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't think that there's any new movies that I even want to see really, besides when we went to see Finding Nemo, that was sure is a long movie, holy cow.
R:  Yeah.  Was it long?
L:  Yes.  Yes and my --
R:  Wha- --
L:  -- littlest one almost didn't get to sit through the whole thing 'cause he wanted to go play video games, so, yeah --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so, ah, yeah it was --
R:  So, ah, did you enjoy it then?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it was very good, it was cute.  It was kind of like Monsters Inc and, you know, Toy Story, kind of like those.
R:  Okay, uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] So, yeah, there was a -- it was kind of nice --
R:  That's nice.
L:  -- and it wasn't really all kid orientated.  I mean, they kind of got the, you know, the fa- -- the parents into it too so [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] All right, well, that's good.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] it was not just kids.  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] Um.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Let me see, um.
L:  [NOISE] Hey guys, mom's on the phone, you gotta be quiet please.
R:  [LAUGH] How old are they?
L:  [NOISE] Three and two.
R:  Three and two.  Okay, they're little.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeas, they're a handful, tell you that.
R:  They keep you busy, I know.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  So, I had fi- -- I have -- I have five, but most of mine are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- older now so --
L:  Oh, goodness.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was like, "Ugh", so I'm getting glad -- my youngest is, ah, fifteen.
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's a fun age.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No thank you.
R:  Those teens.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But good luck when you get there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Oh, I can't imagine five, holy cow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I had two of 'em going, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through adolescence at the same time so that was like, ah, a real pull your hair out, like, almost.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  Hey guys, that's enough.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I'm on the phone.  Can you go outside and play please?  It's been a long time since I got a phone call from these people.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, ah, ah, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what, they do it sp- -- ah, periodically or --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  'Cause, as I say, it must be about a month since the last phone call -- phone call I got.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  Um, did you see -- um, I guess you're unlikely to see a movie --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Chicago or any of those that won those big awards.
L:  [NOISE] No I didn't, huh-uh.
R:  No, me neither.
L:  No.  I probably rented it at the -- I don't think I'd go to see to that one because I think it was long too.  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words].  Hey guys get out, no go on.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I do know my husband saw, ah, Gangs Of New York, he went and saw that.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, I haven't heard -- like I haven't heard of that one.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Hey guys that's enough now.  [NOISE] What? 
R:  When I get kind of busy, that I don't even have time to worry about, ah, the movies and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- all that, 'cause I don't even really watch that much TV [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- when I'm home --
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  -- see, I'm just too busy doing other things.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no kidding.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah, I understand that, between doing laundry and keeping --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] the house clean and cooking food and [SIGH] just sitting down to relax --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you get kind of busy.
L:  [NOISE] Sure do.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yes, and we haven't had a whole lot to do, it's been raining here all week.
R:  Really?
L:  Actually today's about the nicest day we've had all week.
R:  Okay.  And where are you from?
L:  Minnesota.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm from New Jersey.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, and it's been, ah -- we've had a lot of rain.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's, um -- what did they say?  I think we've had, oh, from, ah, January up until about last week, we've had eighty five percent --
L:  Really?
R:  -- bad we- weather.
L:  Huh.
R:  [LAUGH] Every --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- weekend it's rained, cloudy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thunder storms, everything.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Yeah, we had a couple of tornado warnings [NOISE] and watches the --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- [NOISE] last couple of days --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, yeah, it hasn't been a whole lot of fun, kind of got cabin fever.
R:  Okay.
L:  Just makes so, [LIPSMACK] yes.
R:  I know how that is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But, ah, since our first week, I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, our first good weekend we had.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Let's hope the fourth of July is the same.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Ah, that's -- that's sure coming around the corner, like, ah, June went by fast.
R:  Right, it did.
L:  Ah ... well, I can't think of anything else they wanted us to talk about.
R:  No, I can't.  I think we -- we're -- our times almost up though I think.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think so too.  It's almost been about ten minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  I think it's about -- I think we started at four O five.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it's four O five here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  You're a hour ahead of me.
R:  An hour ahead?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yep.  So, where in New Jersey do you live?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Where in New Jersey do you live?
R:  Ah, I live, ah, in the Blackwood area.
L:  Oh, never heard of it.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Probably not.  Have you ever been to Jersey before?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Okay, I've never been --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, as far as I've been is Florida.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] I've been there once, a long time ago when I was a kid.
R:  Okay.
L:  Had to see the Walt Disney World thing.
R:  Oh right, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  We took our kids there too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  And, ah, they enjoyed it, it was a good time, like Universal Studios.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was nice.
L:  That was neat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah ... yep.
R:  And seeing how they make the movies and the sound effects --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and some of the things they do, um, went there too.
L:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
R:  Your kids got quiet.  [LAUGH]
L:  They went downstairs to go play.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's nice to have a basement so they can go down to their rooms and play.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yep.
R:  Hm.
L:  Oh, goodness gracious, [LIPSMACK] huh.
R:  This is my -- this is my first time doing this.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's my second time.
R:  So -- is it?
L:  Yep, yep.  Yeah, I can't remember where the lady was I talked to last time. --
