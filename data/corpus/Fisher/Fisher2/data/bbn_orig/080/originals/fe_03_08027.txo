L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- internet Backgammon.  I think Hearts is my favorite, ah, computer game that I play.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] I usually play lots of games on the internet.  Most of my games are played off the line but -- 'cause I like the programs that they -- that windows comes with because it's easy to get Spider Solitaire --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but Spider Solitaire, internet Backgammon --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I don't like Classic Hearts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, Checkers, eh, those are okay, but I like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- going to the casinos --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- those are the best.
R:  Okay.  [NOISE] Um, I -- I've played Spider Hearts also, um, I enjoy that also, um.
L:  Yeah, me and -- me and my husband have fights over it.
R:  [LAUGH] I also have a pinball game on my -- that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- came with my computer, I like to play that also.  Ah, [LIPSMACK] think [NOISE] hm, I have some games that I have on -- on a CD that I [NOISE] --
L:  CDRoms, oh, I -- I had the hand held games --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, like for Tetris and stuff like that.  I haven't done that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in years.  Um, Nintendo --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I used to play Nintendo and Sega, again that was years ago.  [LIPSMACK] But now, I'll probably be getting more into this once my baby is born.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Yeah, my -- both of my boys, one of them have a -- a Nintendo and the other one has a -- a Playstation and they play it all the time and get me playing.  They have Wheel Of Fortune, um, a couple of basket ball games and some football games.
L:  That's fun.
R:  Those are pretty fun, huh.
L:  I wanted to get more for the husband so he can get involved in the -- the football games and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE] It's a -- now I -- I try to be really selective of the type of games that I let my kids play --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, because I know there are a lot of, ah, violent games out there and I don't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- want them to be, ah, interacting with that type of -- type of game.
L:  I was really shocked at the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- new ones coming out, I'm like looking at this going, "You gotta be kidding me".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "What happened to like Pacman?"  That was like the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- awesomest game around.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Those type of arcade games, Pacman and Centipede.
L:  Unreal.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Now it's all blood.  Blood and gore.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  So, yeah, I think it's really, ah, important to kind of supervise the type of games that the kids play.
L:  You have to.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Definitely.
R:  And I -- I used to enjoy, ah, the Atari games a long time ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] they have some really nice games, ah, plain games.  [LAUGH] Ah, they had a, like, Yars' Revenge -- ah, [LIPSMACK] let me think.  I think they had a Pacman game on the Atari system.  I can't remember --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but that's so long ago.
L:  Yeah.  But I'm getting off a line lately.  I've been staying off it a little bit.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] Only until, of course --
R:  Right, right.
L:  I mean, we had the unlimited time and now it's like, I told them, I said, "Just get the short one, we're not on it that much any more, he works --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- overtime and I'm ..." -- I'm eight months pregnant now --"
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- do too much.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, um, another game I played, ah, I signed up for, ah, for was Wheel Of Fortune --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I would go on line and play that or you can, ah, play other people that's on line --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's pretty fun.
L:  Yes, there -- there's a lot of fun games on line but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we just had a casino that opened up twenty minutes around from me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- well, it's like I go there [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to play.
R:  Ah.
L:  You know, but it's -- it's hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just want more opportunities for my child.
R:  Mhm.
L:  More, um, educational gain, more than --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the gore --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't like the gore games.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you'd be surprised how many parents don't really pay attention to that.
L:  I know.
R:  Uh-huh.  And I really think that it affects not only kids but adults too --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- you don't realize that it affects them, but I -- subconsciously I think it affects anyone really.
L:  I mean, when we were in, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Nintendo, we played Zelda --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that was the best game ever and it's --
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  -- just -- it was non stop, and we didn't want to stop and we were up for hours --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- hours playing this, like, excuse me it was, like, what, four o'clock in the afternoon, it's three thirty in the morning now and [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow, that is a lo- long time.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah, we gotta go to work in the morning you know.  Not right away.
R:  Yeah, that's a long time.
L:  Too much.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  Well, this is great.  Thanks for calling.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Have you done one of these calls --
L:  No.
R:  -- before?  Okay, this is my first one too so I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I really kind of didn't know what to do.  I say, "Well, I guess I better start talking".  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't know if I was gonna just talk to the machine or not, I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- didn't know I'd be talking to another person.  Well, that was cool.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Good deal.
R:  Yeah, I think it said you'd get to do, like, three calls or something like that.
L:  Wonderful.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  So, that's all they do, they listen to our recording?  [LAUGH]
R:  I think so, I think so.
L:  So, how do we know we're done?
R:  I don't know, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think they said after ten minutes -- ten minutes I think.  I'm not sure what time it was when the call started --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- I wasn't paying attention.
L:  [SIGH] Too much going on around me, I can't pay attention.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm trying to think, there's another game that I learnt to play off the internet and I can't think of the name of it, um --
L:  It's hard when I don't have it open up for me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, um -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- like I said, I go to the casinos and I play blackjack and poker and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- slots, and I love the slots --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, my gosh, I love those slots.
R:  You win -- win a lot off of them?
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay, mm.
L:  And I'm, like, "Where's the money".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have to go where they have real cash value and I do --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I go to the real cash ones, but it takes forever to accumulate stuff and what not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the one, um, w- what did I do?  I get more money from surveys.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've heard that they have those out, surveys that you can do.
L:  Yeah, I have a lot of those.
R:  Mhm.  You do those from -- on the internet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Wow.
L:  All the time.

L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know if you hear- heard of that?
L:  No.
R:  Um.
L:  Oh, yes, I heard that.
R:  Yeah, and that's basically how I found out about this, ah -- doing these calls --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- was through the mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, yeah.  The site that I go to, ah, had it listed so I applied.  [NOISE]
