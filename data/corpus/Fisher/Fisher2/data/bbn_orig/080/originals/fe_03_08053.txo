R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Amanda Kevington.
L:  Hi, I'm Rosie Bonnea[?].  How ya doing?
R:  Good.  I'm in Texas.
L:  So am I.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, cool.  What city?
L:  Houston.
R:  Oh, we're in Odessa.
L:  Where's that?
R:  Uh, by Midland where President Bush is from.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  We just came from San Antonio a few days ago.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I left Miami three weeks ago.  [LAUGH]  So, I don't really know Texas that well.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, is it hot up there?
L:  Here in Houston.  Yes.
R:  And humid?
L:  I think it's hotter than Miami.
R:  Really?  It's hum- humidity isn't it?
L:  Yes, very, very humid.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You go outside and you're drenched.
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]  Over here --
L:  I guess we're ...
R:  -- over here we're dry, dry heat.
L:  Well, that's something better.  Better for the hair.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's better.  But as far as computer games go I do play one, uh, the Sims.  I don't know if you've ever heard of that one or not.
L:  No.  I don't play any computer games.  I mean -- well, the ones that come I guess with the regular computer, like the [LIPSMACK], um, Solitaire, something like that --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I have played those.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But very, very, very rarely.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the Sims is the one where you control the people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, you can like, um, build fam- families and [COUGH] I even got -- ended up getting my husband into it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But it's -- it's actually fun 'cause you control what they do, what kinda job they have, uh, if they have kids or not.  I mean, it really is and you can ...
L:  What's the website?
R:  Um, I'm p- -- I don't know if you can go to -- just, you know, W.W.W. dot Sims dot com or ...
L:  Sims?  S.I.M.S.?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You might be able to do it that way.  Um, I'm not exactly sure but, um [NOISE], I bought it through -- you know, just bought it through a grocery store.
L:  Oh, oh, okay.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  But do you play against other people through the Internet or do you just ...?
R:  You -- yeah, you can do it against other people on the Internet, but I haven't ever tried that one.
L:  You just play against the computer?
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, I mean, it is -- it is fun.  It's time consuming.  But, I mean, uh, when I was pregnant with my last child that's what I did a lot.
L:  Okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Entertaining I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It is.  It is.  I mean, it -- I don't play a whole lotta games but, uh, that I do and then I have A.O.L. --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, we like to play, uh, some of the A.O.L. games, um, like the, uh, Slingo.  Have you ever played that?
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] It's fun.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  I mean, it's kinda like Bingo, but it's a little bit different, and then there's also [NOISE] -- there's also, um -- I'm just trying to think of the other ones we've been playing -- called Pop It and you pop these balloons and you win points and eventually you can like redeem prizes through A.O.L.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah.  I gotta start getting into these games.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't play any of them.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, no, well, I -- we don't -- I mean, we don't get on a whole lot and play games but, um -- 'cause I trade coupons online mainly but, uh ...
L:  Well, I spend the whole day in front of the computer.  That's what I do for work.  So, when I get home I don't -- I don't wanna see one basically [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unless I have to.
R:  Yeah.  But this is -- how did you sign up for this, through the Internet or ...?
L:  Somebody sent me an email.  Um, this guy sent me an email and he told me that you get I guess ten bucks for a survey or something like that and ...
R:  Uh-huh.  So far this is my second one.
L:  Oh, okay.  This is my first -- first one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they really pay you?
R:  No.  I haven't gotten nothing yet but, uh, my first one was barely last week.
L:  Oh, okay.  So --
R:  So ...
L:  -- no time to judge yet?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  But last week we discussed, um, the gas prices.
L:  Well, that's a very big range of topics there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] the gas prices.
R:  Yeah.  And the girl that I was talking to was in Florida.  So, her prices were a lot higher than here.
L:  Yes.  I guess most of them there -- and you're right, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Florida prices are higher --
R:  Yeah.  It was.  [NOISE]
L:  -- for some reason, I guess, uh, more people vacationing or something.  I don't know.  So --
R:  But yet I was just ...
L:  -- so what happens now?
R:  Um, you just -- basically they're recording our conversation --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- discussing, you know, the -- the topic that we're supposed to discuss and I was just gonna let you know that you can go to W.W.W. dot V. Sims dot E.A. dot com and that --
L:  What ...?
R:  -- and that -- that pulls up the deal about the Sims.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, just in case you ever wanna try it.  It's -- it is -- I'm serious -- it's really fun.  It's time consuming, but it's fun [NOISE], and then they also have it out on Playstation.
L:  Okay.
R:  But as far as any other computer games -- I was trying to think if I knew of any more -- we, uh -- I don't really think we're -- I mean, we've got the basic ones like you said you had, but I don't think I have any ...
L:  Yeah, the ones that come with Windows.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  But that's all I have too.  Now, my kids have a ton, a lot of the learn- ...
L:  They have like a Nintendo, a Playstation or something?
R:  Well, like on the computer they have a -- a lot of learning ones.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, um [NOISE] -- but, um, I don't know.  You gotta try it some time.  It's kind of expensive to buy it, you know, brand new.  But it's fun though.  I guess like about thirty or forty dollars.
L:  That is expensive for a game.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But I guess it's kinda like a story?  You -- you -- you ...
R:  Yeah.  And you -- and you -- I mean, it saves it.  You know what I'm saying?  And you can go off and leave it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it'll keep -- it'll -- it'll just keep on going.
L:  So, what's the purpose of it?  Uh, can you make money or something?
R:  Well, y- yeah.  You accumulate money and then you get to buy more things, make a bigger house, you know, move out and buy a new house.  I mean, however you wanna do it --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and that's not all they have.  They also have like one where you make roller coasters, one where you make, um, cities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with buildings and stuff and, uh, I used to play one a long time ago when I was younger, um, on, uh, Super Nintendo and it was where you were building, uh, cities and stuff with railroads and just all kinds of stuff.  But, uh, you can also buy, um, extra packs that go on 'em and add stuff like, um [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know -- like pets and stuff or -- just all kinds of stuff.  Sometimes you'll be playing and all of a sudden you'll have a baby just -- an adoption agency will drop off a baby inside your house --
L:  I see.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and all of a sudden you're taking care of a baby.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it's just weird, but it's neat, you know?
L:  Okay.  Twists, little twists here and there.
R:  Yeah.  But basically that's the only one that I know about that we've really played other than, like you said, the card games and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then the A.O.L., uh, online games.
L:  I haven't -- I haven't tried any of the A.O.L. games.
R:  Do you have A.O.L.?
L:  Yes.  I do have A.O.L., but ...
R:  All you -- all you have to do is go into key word games.
L:  I've -- I've seen that.  I've just never been in there.
R:  Oh, you've gotta try it.  It's fun.
L:  I haven't tried it yet.
R:  They also have dominoes on A.O.L.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if you like to play dominoes or not.
L:  [MN]
R:  But you're literally playing against someone else on the computer, somewhere else, you know?
L:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
R:  Which is ...
L:  They set you up with somebody else?
R:  Yeah.  Which is kinda neat 'cause then you meet new people, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  We've had fun doing that.  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  But my husband and I we have like little spurts where we get addicted [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and be up to like three o'clock in the morning playing games.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  It's crazy.
L:  That is crazy if you have to get up early to go to work.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, he works in an oilfield.  So, he's -- when he's off he's off and I don't work.  I'm a stay at home Mom of four.  I have four children.  [NOISE]
L:  Does he work like, uh, three weeks on, three weeks off type of thing?
R:  Uh, no.  He's just on call and he --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- he works with directional tools.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, whenever he's gone he's gone.  He could be gone a month, two months, and then when he's home he could be off a month or two months.  It just depends.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  But ...
L:  But you don't know?
R:  No.  We don't know, but that's how we got to go to San Antonio.
L:  I see.
R:  [NOISE] That's how we got to go to San Antonio last week 'cause he's off, but ...
L:  Kinda hard to plan though?
R:  Yes.  It is.  It is very hard to plan.
L:  But I guess you get used to it.
R:  Yeah.  We've -- we've adjusted.  It's been hard since the baby's been born 'cause I -- I really a lotta times needed help.  But, like I said, I keep myself entertained and play that game sometimes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Especially when the baby's asleep and then when they're in school -- I have three in school and then just him home, the baby.  So ...
L:  How many children do you have?
R:  Four.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You sound so young.
R:  I'm twenty eight.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you going to have any more?
R:  No.  No.  No.  No.  I'm done.  I'm done.
L:  The shop is closed, huh?
R:  The what?
L:  The shop is closed?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm thirty six.
R:  Do you have any?
L:  No.  I don't have any.
R:  None?  You decided no?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, I don't have any.  Uh, actually I've been divorced for a few years and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- hopefully I'll get married again and -- and --
R:  I've been through that.
L:  -- maybe I will.  You're twenty eight, you have four kids and you've been -- 
R:  Divorced.
L:  -- you're married and remarried?  [LAUGH]
R:  I've, yep, been divorced one time.  Married my high school sweetheart and he left me.
L:  Okay.
