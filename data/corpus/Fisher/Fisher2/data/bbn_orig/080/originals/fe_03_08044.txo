R:  Yes.  My name is Muriel Pitts.
L:  Muriel, my name is Chris Twilly.  How are you?
R:  Well, how are you doing?  Look at that -- looked like that recording was woof, huh.
L:  Ah, [inaudible], yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, ah, have you done this before?
R:  No, I haven't, sir.
L:  Okay.  I haven't either.  B- -- um, I did read in some of the post that we just, basically, carry on a conversation about this [inaudible].  And, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  Just keep going with that, until they tell us --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that the ten minutes have passed.  So, do -- do you play, ah computer games?
R:  No, I don't.  I like to, but I really don't play it.
L:  Okay.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Hm.  I'm not sure where we go --
R:  No, like --
L:  -- from that?  [LAUGH].
R:  No, what I'm saying is, I like computer games.
L:  That's it.  Do you ever --
R:  But I'm not very -- you know, I've -- I'd have never learned  --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to, you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  I play a little bit.  Ah -- but I'm not very good at it.
L:  Okay.  Do you ever --
R:  Oh, many --
L:  -- play, ah, solitaire?  Um --
R:  Off the computer.
L:  -- you ever played either, on -- on the computer or off the computer?  Okay.  Right.  'Cause that's one of the things -- I tell you, it's one of the best games that I have played.  Ah, one of the easiest ones to play on the computer.  Solitaire.  Ah, 'cause fortunately you don't have to do any of the card flipping, ah, yourself.  The computer does everything for you, and if you conclude that you don't think you're gonna win that particular hand, then, it --
R:  Oh, that sounds all right.
L:  -- you can automatically just re-deal a whole new deck.  And --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, so that -- I've, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I got, at one point in time, where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I probably did that every day.  And, um -- because I just wanted to get better at it.  And -- and then, also, I've, ah, played Blackjack, ah, on the computer as well as --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've played that online against other people.
R:  So how many games can you play on a computer at -- you know?
L:  Um, and play Tetris, on the computer.
R:  I mean, how many the games would the computer offer, or is it just that certain, s- -- you know, software that o- -- you know, offers, ah, you know, maybe this game --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- or like you said to me, ah, you know, w- -- solitaire, or -- or --
L:  Yeah, most of the, ah -- yeah.  I -- I think most of the, ah, computers --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that you buy nowadays, usually come with at least two or three games already --
R:  I would really say the same, [inaudible] like, you're spending a bit on whatever, yeah.
L:  -- built in to them.  They've already -- they've already included --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the software, and usually solitaire is the one that, nine times out of ten, you're guaranteed is going to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- be on there.  Yeah.  Mhm.  And then, sometimes you'll have --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- ah, Minesweeper, ah, is another one that shows up a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, and, ah, and they'll be some other, less, ah, consistent ones.  Typically you can -- for solitaire and, ah, Minesweeper to be there, and then sometimes you'll have like, a Blackjack, that's included on there.  The -- the good thing is -- is that, to a point --
R:  Hm.  That sounds interesting.
L:  -- the statement you made earlier about the software is -- is that easily the game software is so inexpensive.  You can spend, maybe, nine dollars for a CD disc that might have fifty games on it.  And, um, when I was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, interested --
R:  Yeah.
L:  At one point in time, I wanted to, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- seemed so many people talking about gambling, and being so successful --
R:  Oh, I never thought about in -- in that capacity.
L:  -- with it.  But, I said, okay.  Well, you know I want to go play Blackjack, but what I'll do is, I'll play it on the computer, first.  And I'll really get used to it.  And then, you know, I'll go to the casinos and play.
R:  I -- I notice a lot of people play --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, Blackjack, ah, or twenty one in the, you know, on the computer.
L:  Or -- and, ah, I'm telling you, I played Blackjack --
R:  Matter of fact, I [inaudible] and a --
L:  -- everyday, straight, for at least three or four months.  Finally, at the end of it, I could [inaudible] there's no such thing as winning, consistently.
R:  -- lot of times when, ah, they some of the guys, when they have free time, they'll always just, you know, go to the computer, and, like you said, they'll, you know, play one of the games, but -- well, like I said, as for me, myself, that I've --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I'm not a computer literate, so I just, you know, it just looked interesting.  You know.  Mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, ah, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'll say when -- um, I've got, ah, three kids, and my -- my youngest is nine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I got her --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, I started her -- which is one of the good things about some of the games --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they can be so simple.  Ah, I think I had her playing solitaire as early as four.  Ah, and that's one of the good things about solitaire.  And the Blackjack is -- as long as you understand how to play those games --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- without the computer, the computer actually doesn't make it more difficult to play.
R:  Mm.
L:  Unlike if you're trying to operate a computer to surf the net, or any of those other type of things that's much more complex.  But playing Blackjack on the computer is as simple as sitting at a, um, you know, sitting down with your friends, and somebody dealing the card.  That's the good thing about the way they've made the [inaudible].
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're very easy to use.  And, um -- then -- now, also I have a, ah --
R:  Yes [COUGH].
L:  -- twelve year old.
R:  Oh.
L:  Where we play -- a lot of games that we play, um, on various things like X Box and Game Cube, we'll also play those games online, against -- we'll compete against other people on the internet.  Ah, so, I mean, just the other night, we were playing, ah, what is it?  Um, I'm sorry, X Men, to -- and so there is when you get to the point where the games become -- first of all, just to play the game, whether it were computer or X Box, becomes much more complicated, and then making sure that you're logged into the right type of site, and that you are actually playing against some other party that's out there.  Um, that becomes more complex.
R:  See, that's why I lot of, ah, young ones are so drawn to the computer, whereas I'm not, and I always wonder what is drawing them there.  You know.  And I never -- you know, stopped to think, like you said gaming and things like that.  I have, you know, what -- I just never stopped to think about games, or, like you said.  I just -- if I -- you know, like I said, I haven't gone and, ah, learn how to -- or taken lessons, to, ah, use, ah, you know, the computer, but it, ah -- I -- I just -- it's --it's fascinated y'all, and I -- I understand what, you know --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- where kids -- exactly.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, what the big attraction -- yeah, I would say, you know, like, with -- and you know, it varies by age.
R:  Yes.
L:  With my twelve year old --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- he probably drawn half of his time is -- or -- or I should take that back -- more than half of his time is game related.  Probably seventy five percent.  He's into playing the game online, or one of the things that they have online is, they have a lot of the, ah, ah, what they call cheat sites.  And it's not really an appropriate name, but what it does is, it's places that he can go, where they will give him clues on how --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to move to the next level, in a game.  So, instead of having to figure out, okay, ah --you know, most of the games that are computer games, including the more technical ones where, ah -- I mean, we've got one where we have a F fifteen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fighter, ah, pilot.  Um, and we have a joystick.  And we have to fly around and we have to bomb various sites and things like that.  And what happens is, is that once you, you know, destroy so many sites, then you move to the next level, in that game.  And then you move to the next level.  Well, they have sites that we can go to that give you clues on how to overcome some problem.  Like, every time that we've flown into, ah, lets say some bunker, we've always been blown up.  We've never been able to get to the next level, 'cause we were --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- always blown up, and what you do is, you go to all these cheat sites, and they'll give you actual, ah, instructions that say, okay, here's what you do.  Fly to the left, and then do a double shift, and a alt key, at the same time, and that will allow you to go past them when they shoot you, and then you can drop a bomb on them.  It'll be that type of instructions that we get online.
R:  Oh, let me ask you something, concerning, ah, the computer, or like that, um, the games.  What about this, with the, um, [LIPSMACK] what's, ah, the cellular phone -- not a cellular phone.  The, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, the t- -- those, um, oh brother.  Your -- your c- -- your cellular phones.  A lot of cellular phones already have, ah, a lot of games on 'em.
L:  So he spends a good majority of his time either playing on the computer, or actually going out onto the internet and picking up clues on how to --
R:  Okay.  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, how to beat a game, or how to get to the next level in a game.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  PDAs?  Mhm.
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah, most of them, um --
R:  Yes, mhm.
L:  -- now, I've done -- I will actually use my cellphone, and download games to my cellphone.  Ah, because you -- when you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  For the most part, when you're playing on the cellphone, I think there's maybe only a few services that actually allow people to use their cellphones and play against other people.  So -- which would be the same thing as playing online.  But, for the most part, what you can do, is you can -- ah, many of the cellphones, if you have web access, which I have, allows you to connect to the internet, and then you can download various games, ah, onto your cellphone, and then play then on your cellphone.  And sometimes you pay for those games and sometimes, ah, the games are free, or, ah, in some cases, what they'll do is, it may be a dollar ninety nine, you pay to keep the game for thirty days.  Um, but, you know, that's the latest.  And then, also the, ah, personal, digital assistants -- if you've seen the Palm Pilot, and the, um, a bunch of the other --
