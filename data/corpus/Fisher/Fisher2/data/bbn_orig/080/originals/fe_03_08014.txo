L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Shelley.
L:  My name is Suzanne.
R:  Hi, Suzanne.
L:  Have you seen any good movies lately?
R:  Actually, yes, I have.  How about you?
L:  Um, no, I haven't seen a movie in a good long while. [LAUGH]
R:  No?  So, if you were going to see a movie would you go the theater ever?   I guess not, if you say you haven't gone in a long time?
L:  No, I would.  That would be a real treat for my husband and I, actually, 'cause we don't hardly get out and what we wanna to see is that, uh, that s- s- -- pirate movie, you know the one with Johnny Depp in it?  We'd o- --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I don't.  I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp though.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I'll have to go and see that one.  There you go.
L:  Yeah, I -- yeah, we actually like it.  It's a real treat for us, but we don't get to do it often enough.  How 'bout yourself?
R:  Well, I, uh, I [MN] don't rent movies, but I have digital cable --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I will occasionally get pay per view --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and actually, you know, like treat myself that way to one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I like it, because I don't have to drive back to the video store to return a rental.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The one thing I don't like about it is I can't pause it to rewind, so if it's a long movie --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have to sit there for the whole [LAUGH] thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:   So -- but, a- actually, I just saw two good movies last week.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, one was The Red Dragon, which is the follow up to the -- in the Silence of the Lambs --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- series.  And, uh, that's got Anthony Hopkins in it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was fabulous.  That's the first one in the series, even though it was produced last --
L:  Yeah, I, uh --
R:  -- and then other one that was just great was the newest Harry Potter movie.
L:  Oh, I've heard that's pretty good.  I know my daughter liked that.
R:  Yes, actually, I've -- I've seen both, and both have been --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- worth -- worth going and seeing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we saw the first one and I -- I was real -- I liked it a lot, you know, it was a really good movie, even for --
R:  Well --
L:  -- grown ups. [SIGH]
R:  -- the second one's -- now it's out on video, so you'll have to treat yourself, Suzanne, and go and see [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rent that one, definitely.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  They come out on video so much sooner now that you really do, you know, don't have to wait very long.  One w- --
R:  Well, they do.
L:  -- one we regret not seeing is the second Lord of the Rings ones.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  We never got to see that and we just [SIGH] -- you know?
R:  Right.  I -- I went to the theater and saw that when it first came out --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- 'cause I knew that it would be one that you would definitely --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- want to see in the theater, and it was, it was -- it was really good.
L:  Oh, yeah.  We really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- regret not getting to see that.  Who knows when that's going to come out on DVD or whatever, you know?
R:  So, in the area that you live, you don't have small theaters that rerun the older movies?
L:  We used to, it used to be called the Super Saver cinema, but that closed down about three or four years ago and --
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  Yeah, and now there's just the -- your expensive, six, seven, eight dollar movies and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- that's part of the problem.  Who can afford to do that very often?
R:  Well, that is true, isn't it?  Yeah.  No, it is expensive, definitely.
L:  But it's fun, you know.  We make a night out of it and go out to eat first and then just go see the movie.
R:  So, what's your favorite movie then, of, like, all time, like --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- everyone has their one, like mine -- my favorite movie of all time would have to be, like, Gone with the Wind sits up there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I've watched that movie over and over and over --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I know every word, every [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I'd be hard pressed to come up with a favorite.
R:  Would it?
L:  I -- I draw a blank, you know?  I -- I haven't seen a whole lot of movies.  All the movies that everyone else has seen, it's, like, "Uh, no, haven't seen it.  Haven't seen it". [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  Kind of out of the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- out of that culture, I guess.
R:  Out of the movie loop.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And this is your subject that you get today there? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'd like to see more movies, I really would. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's time and money, you know?
R:  So it is, then.  So, that's not a priority for you to -- you have -- you're busy with other things than to go and --
L:  Yes, I -- I have a --
R:  -- take time out?
L:  -- a fifteen month old, so, yeah, he takes up a good deal of my time and energy.
R:  Right.
L:  I g- -- we could -- we -- we used to record our favorite shows, 'cause there's no way we could just sit and watch it with him, as noisy and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- demanding as he is, you know, we just had a week's worth of our favorite shows and watch 'em when we could, you know?
R:  When you can.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's all the time considerations, you just -- it -- then it's not just the price of going out to a movie, you have to get a babysitter --
L:  E- e- exactly.
R:  -- you have to do all this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause you can't take a young baby to the movie and --
L:  Oh, gosh, no.
R:  -- have to walk out and [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, he wouldn't even still for five minutes.
R:  Oh, well, well, a few more years and, yes, then you'll get to go every new h- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- new Disney release that comes out. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- I like those movies.  I like the kid movies too.  Oh, wait a minute, we just saw a really scary one, though.  The, uh, Wrong Turn, have you seen that one?
R:  No.  What --
L:  We thought that was pretty scary.
R:  -- what's that about?
L:  It -- well, it's about a group of kids that, um, are out in -- oh, like, the back woods of, uh, oh, Mississippi or one of those, you know, and they [SIGH] come across this [MN] -- the murdering clan of freaks and they're escape --
R:  Right.
L:  -- trying to escape from them throughout the whole movie and it's really kind of -- it's gets you jumping.
R:  Right.
L:  Me, anyway, my husband just laughed at me.  But I was pretty scared. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, those ones, I know, sometimes -- I live alone and sometimes, you know, there's no way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if something like that is coming up, it's, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- no way I'm sitting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there at the wrong time of the day, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and watching that.  Of course, they're always on late at night --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- they're never on in the middle of the day, no.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Please can I talk?
R:  So, that is the whole thing, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, no, I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- got movie channel, so I -- I do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I try and get my money's worth out it --
L:  Oh, I would too. [NOISE]
R:  -- and try and watch the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ones that, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I have.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I sh- -- I should check the pay per views more often.  I always forget to look through them, you know, 'cause I have digital cable too now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I forget to check for movies and [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And you can -- then you can sort of schedule it around what time, like i- if you have that window of two hours to sit down and watch a movie without --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- interruptions.  But that's the problem that I find --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- is to find that time when I'm not going to be interrupted, even though there are movies that I do wanna see --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- but when are you going to do it?  So, do you have on Tuesdays where it's cheaper to go to the theater where you live?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, the only time it's ever cheaper is a matinee, you know, in the afternoon hours.
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  We also have one of those entertainment books, though, where you -- you can, you know, if it's not a first run movie you can get a movie ticket for, like, five dollars or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is -- which is cheaper.
R:  Right.  At least that's something, hey?
L:  Yeah.
R:  To get going out there and do something like that.
L:  S- so, do you take your children to the movies with you, or --
R:  Well, my daughter, she's twenty one, so --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- if anything, she's the one who gets me more s- --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, she's the one who actually goes the first time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and says, "Oh, you've got to see this" like with The Red Dragon, she had seen it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the first time.  So, then she makes her recommendations to me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which is why I'm surprised that I haven't heard about that Johnny Depp movie, because [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, it's a -- a real --
R:  -- we just --
L:  -- swashbuckling type thing, you know?  Real old fashioned pirate movie.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Well, we had just watched one of his earlier movies, and I was surprised, I was, like, "Is that Johnny Depp?" and it's, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, it is, but it was him, like, when he was fourteen years old.
L:  He's gorgeous. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, isn't he, though?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he is, yeah, he's --
L:  He's a good actor too, he's --
R:  -- good in all his movies.  Like, uh, What -- What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
L:  That's my favorite of his, actually.
R:  Yeah, I -- I definitely like -- and I'm -- was always a big fan of Edward Scissorhand too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I quite liked him in that one too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Of course my daughter was right at that age, right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when that movie came out that we watched that about fifteen hundred times. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My daughter was that way with her movies too --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we watched them, s- -- or she did, several times a day.
R:  Just, yeah, exactly, the favorite ones.  So, yeah, she got broken into them too?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  So, do you find -- here -- here's a good question that would be interesting for the conversation is --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- do you think that, uh, that movies and violence and all of that, that it's influencing our culture and that we're sort of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- seeing what violence, you know, like, is on movies, that we're he- hearing about that more, say, in the headlines of what people will think about doing, because they've seen it on the movies?  Like, do you think that is an actual influence?
L:  I think on certain people it is.  I definitely think that there's people that are way too prone to, you know, influences, they live in kind of a -- a oth- -- other world anyway and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they identify too much with, you know, false characters and I definitely think that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people have been influenced.
R:  So, it's sort of like a -- w- what I -- what I've heard and what I've been, you know, thinking about in recent years myself, like, you know, are the people that make movies, I mean, like, there shouldn't really be censorship in that kind of thing but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- are they sort of, like, responsible to not plant suggestions?  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- certainly a lot of -- I mean, like, the majority of us, we can go see a movie, and we see something and we realize, "Oh, well, that's just a story".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then you get someone who isn't quite of that sound mind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who sees something and it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, "Oh, well, here's -- isn't this just the perfect idea?" and then you actually hear, "What do you mean?  Someone actually tried to do that?" it's, like --"
L:  Y- yeah, it's --
R:  -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, like, there was something in the news actually, recently, I forget what the -- what the thing was, but someone saw a movie, a crime -- oh, the Matrix made somebody kill somebody.
R:  Right.
L:  Or, you know --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- supposedly he was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- influenced by the Matrix to --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- to kill like he did.  So, yeah --
R:  Strange.
L:  -- that's a -- yeah, I think they should definitely, you know, make more upbeat movies, more movies about, you know, family stuff, nature stuff, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- romance, you know, even and there's just way too much violence and --
R:  Violence and all of that kind of, uh, stuff.
L:  -- gratuitous sex and stuff, definitely.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I -- here's another thing, like, just of a point of interest was that, uh, is it Michael Moore who did that one, Bowling for Columbine?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  The one that he did about, you know, like, all the guns and then he won the Academy award --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- this year?
L:  It --
R:  Right, and he got up and he was, like, you know, quite nasty and all of this --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- kind of thing, and yet, because his movie made so much money, guess who's sponsoring his next movie, but Disney?
L:  Oh, oh. [SIGH]
R:  Which is interesting, isn't it though?  Like, just sort of to say, like, where the corporate sponsorship --
L:  Yeah, the -- the --
R:  -- actually falls --
L:  I know.
R:  -- whether they agree with them politically or whatever, I --
L:  You have to wonder if, you know, how many parents know about those connections, you know?
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  If any.
R:  Well, yeah, just, you know, like the -- you know, you can sort of step on people's toes or do whatever you want, but if you're making money, well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then, yeah [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, the almighty dollar.
R:  -- who's going to sponsor your next movie?  Whereas at first no one -- no one would take his movie.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  His initial movie --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- no one wanted to -- to have anything to do with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and then suddenly it's, like, "Oh, we'll -- we'll be there" so, yeah, it does kind of make you wonder what --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- uh --
L:  It does.
R:  -- another good movie that, uh, that -- speaking of, like, Academy award winners that I thought was good is, uh, Life is Beautiful.
L:  Oh, I've heard --
