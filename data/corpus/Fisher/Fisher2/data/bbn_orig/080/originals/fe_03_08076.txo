L:  Hi.  My name is Mary.
R:  Hi.  I'm Charles.
L:  Hi, Charles.  Well, I g- -- I sort of get a combination [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, listen to the radio a lot, um, watch the news on TV, get the newspaper and over the Internet.
R:  Yeah.  I mainly, uh, get mine through the Internet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess the evening news and, uh, on, uh, talk radio, uh, out here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- although, uh, I'm -- I wouldn't consider myself, uh, right wing or conservative or anything like that.  I listen to talk radio, uh, which is primarily conservative republican, uh, based, you know, uh, Rushlin Bond, Sean Hannerdine, all that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, uh, still listen to it and, uh, to get some news off of that.
L:  Well, I listen to our country radio station.  They do mostly local news --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I get the local newspaper, um, watch mostly Fox news.  Once in a while we turn on to CNN 'cause we've got satellite service and, uh, pick up off there --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but, um, not -- I also have a family that lives overseas so I get emails from them.  I get news that way, too.
R:  Oh.  Huh.
L:  Well, it's kind of interesting the way people get it though [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, it all depends on where you're getting it from --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, different, uh, sources have different bias.
L:  Yeah, we're sort of -- we're all sitting here so it's -- it's, uh, han- -- de- -- big type of small town, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Uh, it's kind of funny 'cause I -- I used to live, uh, in a fairly large town and the newspapers there, you know, they're -- follow the news and -- down here they've got the, um, believe it or not, they've got the logs for State Highway patrol --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Sheriff's department and then the local cities [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all listed.  Yeah, they -- [MN] they have a run down on everything and, uh, and it's -- I sort of kind of have to chuckle everytime I see, uh, how to get a cow out of a median strip of I seventy, you know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it -- it -- it's sort of humorous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I know what you're saying.  There -- there's, uh, um -- pick up news here and there and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just about anywhere.
R:  Yeah.  Well, nowadays they have so many different places where you can get it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, especially with cable television and, uh, and they have all the networks that are just news.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, there's CNN or MSNBC or anything like that.
L:  They're all Fox news [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, but I don't really get too much of that 'cause I don't have cable where I live 'cause I just prefer not to have it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for money reasons --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, uh, still, like, if I go visit my mom and she has that digital cable.  I mean, there's just tons of news channels and each one of them, you know, you could get, like, a different spin on the same story.
L:  Yeah, well, here I know, uh, even if we put in, you know, one of those forty foot antennas up we can't any of the local stations.  The only we can do anything is by satellite [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  It's -- we're just sort of in a -- in a little ravine area and it's almost impossible to get regular, you know, the -- the local TV stations at all where we are.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's satellite all the way [SIGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Was bad enough that our -- the, uh, Internet service -- the only way I can get that is dial up or go satellite.  The satellite's too expensive so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think we're a slow dial up [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  See, that's, uh, I guess that's one of the reasons why I like news on the NS because I have D F cell so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if I need, uh, if I want to download any video or anything like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it doesn't take you too long to get it.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Our -- our newspaper's one of these that, uh, they only print six days out of seven and there's lot of places that do seven out of seven but ours is only six out of seven.
R:  What day do they skip?
L:  Uh, Saturday.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.  It's been a long time since I've heard that.
L:  And, uh, they're only -- it's usually only two sections, um, not more than, you know, thirteen, fourteen pages in a section.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  I- it's a small paper [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know you --
R:  Even your Sunday paper?
L:  Oh, we get a Sunday paper.  It's bigger.  You know, it's bigger but it's not as big as, well, as the Cleveland [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  We're -- we're, uh, where are you from?
R:  I live in Texas.
L:  Texas.
R:  Yeah.  Actually, I'm right around Houston.
L:  Okay.  You probably got a pretty big Sunday paper then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably --
R:  Houston Chronicle's pretty big.
L:  Yeah, probably about as big as Cleveland Plain Dealer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, see, I used to live in Cleveland and I'm in Fairdale, Ohio now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and believe it or not, we right at a main intersection of seventy and seventy seven but it is small town rural here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even though it's a main intersection of two major highways [LAUGH].
R:  It's still pretty rural, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and it's, like I say, it's unreal.  If the -- now, see, we have flooding -- uh, ninety eight is when we had flooding through here and the electric was out.  
R:  Uh.
L:  The only way we could get a radio station was battery operated.
R:  Oh, then.
L:  Yeah, and that was, like, at least one full day without electricity.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, it was -- it was unreal.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you have -- actually we've had some, uh, I haven't had to deal with any kind of, like, uh, big electrical outages where I'm at --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and stuff.  I'm on the south west side of the city --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, uh, like, way back in two thousand one when tropical storm Alison hit?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I don't know how much of that news made it that far up north --
L:  Oh, yeah, it -- it made it.
R:  -- but, yeah, it hit, uh, when it hit us -- 'cause the -- the problem was it hit us twice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It hit us one -- I remember it hit us, like, on one, like a Tuesday or something like that and it was just -- there was some pretty heavy rain but, uh, you know, wasn't too bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, like the parking lot -- my apartment's got kind of flooded but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, nothing too bad, [LIPSMACK] and it started moving out east and hit some kind of wind that pushed it back west towards us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it basically sat on top of us for a night --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just pouring rain and, like, I tend -- there were like tractor trailer trucks backed up completely submerged under water on I ten --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it was just like, I mean, it was just weird.  All the over passes --
L:  I heard --
R:  -- on the Interstates looked like bridges.
L:  Yeah, I remember seeing it.  At that time I was mostly getting my news off the Internet and I remember seeing pictures of it and I've got one group that I'm in -- it, uh, some people from Texas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they were real close to being flooded but they weren't.  They were, like, right on the edge of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, yeah -- i- it's just [LAUGH] now between word of mouth and newspapers and everything you get news one way or another --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, it was, uh, it was, like, when nine eleven happened.  I was on the Internet and people started talking about it.  I went and turned the TV on.  I said, "Holy cow".  My -- my husband was out and about and he come back in and I says, "Larry, look at this" [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he was, like, "Whoa", [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's kind -- when nine eleven happened -- 'cause I'm a teacher --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I was at classroom but my classroom, uh, it's kind of an old school, inner city school --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, uh, where I was was one of the rooms they hadn't hooked up the Internet to or I didn't have TV in there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh, [MN] uh, guy, a guy I worked with down the hall, I used to use his, uh, computer to check my email --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, like, first thing -- and, like, in the morning I went and checked it and saw a headline about a plane flew into the World Trade Centre.  It was just when the first plane hit --
L:  Right, yeah, don't think much about it.
R:  -- and so they're saying, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they thought it was like an accident.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's how they wrote the story so it was like, "Wow".  [LIPSMACK] Well, I had this, uh, neighbor next to me who had a radio in his room and he started coming in, bringing me all these updates --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the -- the only reason why I was, like, so concerned is because my mum was actually visiting my brother who lives in Brooklyn --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- at that time and she was supposed to fly out of La Guardia on that same morning --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- and so [LAUGH] I was kind of --
L:  That's scary.
R:  Yeah, I was a little freaked out there for a little while 'cause she was supposed to fly out on, um, September eleventh and, uh, but she -- she actually got to La Guardia at about the time the first plane hit, is when she got to La Guardia and she, uh, saw the second plane --
L:  All right.
R:  -- hit the World Trade Centre, uh, from the airport --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and stuff, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  She wasn't up in the air at that time but she saw everything happen.  There was a guy who was a- ...
