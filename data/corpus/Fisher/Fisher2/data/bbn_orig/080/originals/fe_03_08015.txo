R:  Hi, my name is Mark.
L:  And my name is Dorothy.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Uh, great.  How about you tonight?
R:  I'm all right.  Um, this is the first time I've done this, so --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, so, do you want to talk about the movie you saw last first, or --
L:  Okay, let's decide, do you like going to the movie or renting the movie?
R:  Okay, um, well, I -- I think, because I live in New York city, I definitely like to go to movies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because, um, there's some really good theaters here and I just like to see things on the big screen, I think certain movies lend themselves to the big screen, because that's, like, if you watch, like, if you watch, like, Star Wars on a little screen, it wouldn't be the same experience.
L:  That's for sure. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I would say I -- I prefer, um, big screens as opposed to -- to, uh, to renting a video.  I'm not saying I don't like renting videos --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I love doing that too, but [LIPSMACK] how about yourself?
L:  Well, you know, I live in a small town, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, going to the movie is a big deal here, because there's not much other to do --
R:  I s- --
L:  -- and to get out, uh, because, you know, we're very limited what you can do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, I live in Mississippi in a very rural area --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- so we have, uh, one movie theater --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, so it's, like, you go out for the night and you go to Pizza Hut and you go to the movie and you've had a big night out.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, I -- I -- I kind of prefer --
R:  Well, that can be good too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I kind of prefer going out most of the time to the movies, uh, strictly because of that.  And I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sort of like, as you say, you rent something like Star Wars and you bring it home, it would not be same, you wo- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think you'd just miss the whole effect of it.
R:  Definitely not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, oh, but also, how much is a movie, like, to go see a movie for you?
L:  Uh, four fifty.
R:  It's, like f- -- like --
L:  Four dollars and fifty cents.
R:  Four dollars and fi- -- that's cheap. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I pay, like, nine, actually.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So, that's, like, nine, nine fifty, but [SIGH] -- so I guess if I did actually -- I probably would rent more videos --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I think about it, because it's kind of more expensive to go to a movie, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um [SIGH] --
L:  But, to me, because a movie is a big thing, you know, uh, so I -- I'd probably go to the movies, uh, more than I rent movies.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, what was the last movie you went to see?
R:  Um, it was called Irreversible.  It was pretty, uh, it was -- well, I have -- there was a special actress in it, this woman, M- Monica Bellucci, she's from Italy.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, that's -- that's one of the reasons why I went to see it, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was a French film, actually.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it -- do you -- -- I don't know if you know this movie, Memento, it wasn't really a big movie, but it was -- it actually got a lot of awards.
L:  Mm.
R:  But it was a smaller, independent movie, and it kinda went backwards in time --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- like, so this movie was like that, it went backwards in time, do you know what I mean?  So -- so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in other words, the movie started, like, in the future and went right back through, like, all the things that happened.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And it was pretty good.  I mean, it was -- it wasn't [SIGH] -- I mean, it was kind of shocking too, there was some shocking scenes in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, I don't think it really made it to the big, big screens, if you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I kinda like being able to see movies like that in a way, because then you really get to see some really good acting and -- and, uh, I mean, this person is -- Monica Bellucci's, like, in -- she's in a lot -- she's going to be in a -- she was in the Matrix, she had a little part and she's going to be in another movie, um, I'm just saying, but, like -- like, so I like independent -- like, that's why I went to that, because I just wanted to see -- even though it was in French, I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- I still wanted to see it.
L:  It's, like, d- down here, you'd never have an opportunity to see anything like that, because --
R:  Really?
L:  -- if it's not put out by Warner Brothers or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Paramount [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's not two years old, you're not going to see it here and then [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  So, what was the last movie you did see, then?
L:  Well, as a matter of fact, I -- I went to the movies last night and it -- I saw Alex and Emma.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I wanted to check -- is that -- is -- how is that?
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, let me put it this way, I was the only one in the whole theater --
R:  Really?
L:  -- uh, for that screen.  It's, like, seven screens here.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, uh, that particular, uh, [MN] p- -- it's, uh, theater, uh, holds, like, eighty four people, and I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- was the only one in there --
R:  Wow.
L:  "-- and I went out and I said, uh, when the movie was over, I said, "Uh, [MN] let me ask you, how many people was here at the seven thirty movie?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And she said, "Four".  I went, "Oh".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In other words, [LIPSMACK] not well attended.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know --
R:  But --
L:  -- it was kind of a love story, um --
R:  Right.  But was it good?
L:  Um, [MN] mm, fair.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- it was not really good, uh --
R:  No?  Yeah.
L:  -- just --
R:  Well, because Kate Hudson, she's kinda -- she's in New York sometimes, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I just wondered.  I -- I kind of like her, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, more maybe because she's a -- I think she's Go- -- Goldie Hawn's daughter or something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- and that's one of the reasons I went to see it, because she was in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, I just went pretty much, uh, because of her being in the movie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but it wasn't bad, you know, it was, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- i- i- it was, uh, fair.
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
L:  Um, liked the ending, uh-huh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that was good.  I always like a -- a good ending to a love story, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it had a good ending to it.
R:  I -- I wonder if you saw a movie called the Pianist?  I -- I wonder if you saw that one?
L:  No.
R:  The guy won an Oscar for it.
L:  Hm.
R:  Um, but the reason why I was -- uh, we -- uh, we can talk about other -- like, we've a- -- we talked about those questions, yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is there any other questions we're supposed to talk about, or just movies now?
L:  Just movies in general.
R:  Okay.  Well, what I do myself is, um, what -- well, this guy A- -- his name is Adrian Brodie, I don't know if you watched -- I think it was the Oscars.  Yeah, I -- I think it was the A- Academy awards or whatever, he won -- it's called the Pianist, it's -- it's about, um, I think it's about -- about, like, the Nazis or something, I don't know, and he survives through the concentration camp and he's a pianist.
L:  Oh.
R:  But what I do is I, um, well, I went to this movie, another movie made a- and -- and actually, he was there in the movie theater watching it.
L:  Oh, you're kidding?
R:  And then -- well, have you ever heard of him, Adrian Brodie?
L:  O- o- oh, yeah.
R:  He's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, he's kind of skinny and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, it w- -- because it was a smaller movie, it was called Love the Hard Way, it wasn't really -- it was like a story of, like, um, like, he's just a guy who doesn't really have that great a life and then he meets some girl that's much younger and she's going to school and she has a good life ahead of her, and he kind of plays around with her and then leaves her, like, and she starts doing bad things, but I don't think [LAUGH] he's that popular.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he's a good actor and all but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I volunteered for that, and I didn't really have to work and then I just -- I didn't meet him or anything, 'cause I don't really know him, and I -- I wouldn't want to walk up to him and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm not like that, if I saw a star, I -- I -- I don't know if I'd walk up to them but, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, anyways, yeah, that was -- so I do things like that when I -- to -- to see movies, so, like, I get to go see it before sometimes it comes out in the theater and then -- and then -- but these are, like, independent movies, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] but, um, I like -- I myself like thrillers.  I like things that, you know, are thrillers.  I don't -- I don't like movies with lots of special effects and all that stuff.
L:  No.
R:  I mean, it's okay to me, but --
L:  No, I -- I --
R:  -- what about you?
L:  No, I don't like things with special effects.  I very seldom go -- if I'm going to see a movie, it's either a comedy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or usually a -- a love story.  I prefer comedies --
R:  Yeah, comedies.
L:  -- I like to go and have a good laugh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, but --
R:  Like, I heard the -- it's called A Mighty Wind.  It's supposed to be, like, it's, like about folk music, but, like, a funny -- like, funny?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I heard a lot of good things about this movie, so --
L:  Oh, okay.  Now, what was the name of that?
R:  Have you ever heard of that?  It's A Mighty Wind.  It's, like --
L:  No, I'll have to --
R:  -- it's, like, Peter, Paul and Mary, they kind of make fun of, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the old folks -- but it's, like, supposed -- you know, it's a comedy, so --
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I'll have to watch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, if it's been out, um, a year or so it might get down this way, you know?
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It take -- it ta- -- it takes a while for movies to get --
L:  It takes a while after they're out to get down here. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They go to --
R:  I gotta say, see, I -- I came from a city, like, that -- up in Massachusetts --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- s- so -- and it's the same thing, the movies don't -- but ever since I came here, I mean, of course, it's just because I'm in New York city, it's, like, sometimes a movie comes here, and I don't even know if sometimes they make to other parts of the country, 'cause either it didn't do well --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they just decide it's no good or [SIGH] -- but, um, [SIGH] so, what about the Matrix?  You're not -- you probably didn't go see that then, right?
L:  Uh, no, I didn't.  It was here but, uh, I was out of town, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on a -- a business trip --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- when actually it was playing, so I did --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- not get to see it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I [MN] heard that a lot of people, uh, went to see it.  It was, you know, packed, like, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
