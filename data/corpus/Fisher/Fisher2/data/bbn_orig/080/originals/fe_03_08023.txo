R:  Hi, I'm Mike.
L:  Hi, my name's Jackie.
R:  Jackie?
L:  Yes.  I'm sorry, I'm at a drive through right now, so if you hear any noises, it's --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  -- just me and [inaudible].  I'm sorry --
R:  [LAUGH] That's okay.
L:  -- they caught me off guard. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, movies, right?
R:  Yeah, [MN] if you like --
L:  Ok- --
R:  -- staying in, going out and that -- I think, like, what types of movies or something. [LAUGH]
L:  And what was the last movie.
R:  Um --
L:  Thank you.  I'm sorry. [NOISE] Okay, great.  Um, actually, I did see a movie last night that I really enjoyed.  I saw the Italian Job at the theater, of course, and this was really good.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um, I guess I prefer, um, being at home, only because, uh, movies come out so much sooner nowadays.  I've noticed they come out within, like, four months.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And of course it's cheaper and it's convenient and, uh, comfortable.
R:  As I say, 'cause the last time I went to a movie, I think it was, like, fifteen bucks for two people, [LAUGH] then -- and you spend another --
L:  Oh, it's more now.
R:  -- and then you spend another, like, twenty bucks just on -- on a soda and sometimes a -- maybe, uh, some candy, not even popcorn. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  It's, like, really expensive.
R:  [LAUGH] So, if you're spending fifty bucks to go out, it's, like, and what do you have to show after?  It's, like, oh, and, um --
L:  Exactly, and the popcorn's not that great.  I had a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- friend that move -- worked at a theater and he told me never to eat popcorn.
R:  Where at home, you can watch --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- one or two movies, stop it or restart it and, like you say, it's cheaper, the -- you make all you want at home, get up and leave and come back. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Stop it and break.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Or --
R:  -- I think, too, the last movie I saw was How to L- -- How to Lose a Man or How The -- or w- whatever that was called. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, How to Lose a Man in Ten Days?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did your girlfriend make you go?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, she did?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- 'cause I was gonna make my boyfriend [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I didn't. [LAUGH] Well, did you enjoy that one?
R:  Yeah, it was funny.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  And, um --
L:  Well, [MN] what else -- we can talk about the -- what kind of movies we like, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yes, and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- before that, I'm trying to think of the movie I saw before that, it's been a while, but, um, usually I like horror movies, just because my sister always had watched 'em --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- and, um [LAUGH] --
L:  That's my favorite.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I love, like, uh, just a -- a thriller or anything, oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But nowadays, movies, like, especially scary movies aren't, uh, good at all, like nothing ever scares me.  Um, I liked the, uh, what was called?  The Ring.  Did you ever watch that one?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  It was a horror movie about, um, last year.  Did you hear about that one?
R:  Hm, I don't think I saw it. [MN] That must --
L:  Everybody knows about the Ring.  Well, you should watch it.  It's a pretty good movie.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  I'll have to look for it.
L:  -- other than that, I don't -- I don't know any other good movies that are out.  I hadn't gone to the theater in about five months, and then I just went last night, just -- just because, but, uh, I guess we both prefer, uh, staying at home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- much better.  What else do I like?  I like comedies, but I -- I don't think any, uh, movies that are made are any good nowadays --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like I said.  Every movie just, uh, isn't worth it anymore.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] How many -- or is this your second time doing this, or [MN] the first time, or --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Third.  It -- third --
L:  Third?
R:  -- because [MN] sometimes I actually haven't been home, like last night, they couldn't find anybody at this time of night. [LAUGH] Since I haven't sat at home.
L:  Yeah, what time -- where are you calling from?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm from Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in, uh, California, so I -- that's probably, like, a two or three hour difference.  Huh.
R:  Yeah, it's eleven o'clock here.
L:  Oh, yeah, two hours, yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  I just went to Hawaii so I'm getting adjusted to the -- the time here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but, uh, no complaints.  Oh, I'm trying to park my car.  I know it's bad to talk on the phone and -- and, uh, they just kind of caught me off guard.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's starting to rain here, which it's done a lot lately, so another good reason to stay home [LAUGH] and I can watch -- I can watch the movies. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I love the rain.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I've heard it's much worse there than in California here.  I probably don't know what rain is yet, [NOISE] until I head over there.  Um, when do they pay calls?  Is it after ten calls or ... do you have any idea?
R:  What is that?
L:  When do they start paying you for the calls that you take?
R:  Um ... I re- -- I thought it was after three, because I thought that three was the max, but I think there was something else you could sign up for doing as many as you wanted.
L:  Oh, because I spoke to someone maybe a couple of weeks ago and he told me done ten calls.
R:  Ten calls?
L:  Yeah, and I was just, like, "Oh, ten?"  I didn't know about ten, I was just curious to know, um, why it was ten [NOISE] calls.  Huh.  So you've only done three?  This is my second one.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I guess I -- I'll be waiting.  Okay, but, uh, I guess we have -- [MN] how many more minutes [NOISE] do we have?  About three more minutes. [NOISE] Anything else about movies? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I like staying at home.  I like horror movies, uh [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] Uh, [LAUGH] y- you know that movie, uh, seems --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- awful, that, um, that comedy, uh, remember?  Dumb and Dumber.
R:  Dumb and Dumber?  I think I did see that.
L:  Remember -- or actually, they -- they have a new one coming out, it's called Dumb and Dumberer and it's -- it's really just -- don't even waste your money on that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I would never watch that, and it's not even, um, Jim Carrey in it, it's just, uh, them, uh, before they go to -- or when -- when they're in high school.  It's not even worth it, but, um, um, um, um, yeah, theaters are very expensive, the food there is not even good and it's expensive, the seats are awful.  The seats are terrible, but, yeah, home is better.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  I -- I hope they're recording all this.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sure they are. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, seven minutes.  Um, um, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess it's good to meet, uh, people this way, just to talk to someone different for ten minutes.  I learned a lot about the last guy, we were talking about just tons of different things, about music, and he was in the -- in the army and it was pretty cool, we just kind of, uh, went off topic --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I don't know if it matters. [LAUGH] I hope not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wonder if it matters?  Huh.  I hope it doesn't matter.  Do you think the -- like, go -- yeah, they definitely go through each recording, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Sorry. [LAUGH] Your turn. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- types of movies, well, we know we like to stay at home, um --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] expense was one of the reasons, convenience, um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and I think, like I said, that sometimes I'll even rent, like, two movies and watch two at --
L:  Yeah, cheaper.
R:  Mhm.  Um --
L:  Um, what else?  Um, um, um, um, um, um, pausing, I guess.  Con- -- we already said convenience.  Oh gosh.  This is not the best subject.  I thought it would be easy, but I guess, uh, we just keep repeating things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sorry. [LAUGH] They just -- like I said, they caught me at a very bad time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was at the drive through, I was about to come home, I had been, uh, out all day, so I just got home.
R:  Oh, I was just reading something too on this one place that had a drive in movie theater, yet -- and it's -- I haven't been to a drive in movie theater in years. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  I -- I went to one maybe three years ago and, uh, it was kind of neat to just experience that, because I -- I've never, you know, been at one before.  It was kind of fun and, um, I haven't seen -- I mean, you don't see them around much at all.
R:  Yeah, well, one of the concerns was too with neighbors so close by, everything's building up everywhere, I think too, with -- so with drive ins, the noise factor --
L:  Oh, yeah, that's true.
R:  -- ne- -- so I think that's another reason you don't see, like, the drive in movie theaters anymore.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  And, um, and just because they don't build them anymore, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Just the ones that are left.
R:  'Cause I think that -- that would be kind of fun to do something like that with a bunch of friends, go out to a movie, th- then I could see doing that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's fun.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh good, we found something to talk about.  We're almost done.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We should be interrupted any minute now.
R:  Um, yeah, I -- I -- I think I wanna stick with --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- horror movies I like most, staying at home, [MN] due the -- the money factor, convenience, um --
L:  What is your favorite, um, horror movie, just out of curiosity?
R:  Um, I don't like the, like, religious ones, because I always think that they could be true, you know, or possibly true, where the ones that are kind of made up, like the Freddie Krueger, they kind of get to me, it's, like, "Oh, gross" you know?  And it's kind of like --
L:  I don't like blood. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No blood.
R:  And I've watched, like, the Hellraiser once and those are kind of spooky, because you think of r- religion involved, kind of, almost like, "Could that happen?" you know?
L:  Oh --
R:  And the --
L:  -- so you don't like it because it's believable --
R:  Well, it's potentially --
L:  -- kinda?
R:  -- some of it could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it kind of links together, like, "Hey, could that really ha- --" you know what I mean?  But the -- with anything, you know, I don't know, and sometimes actually the old fashioned horror movies are kind of fun though too, because --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- it was almost like there was more suspense in the waiting to see what happens, you know, versus all the -- today, all the automation, all the -- everything, you know?  'Cause all these -- now they're coming out with all these -- I haven't seen the Matrix or whatever, but, like, um, hi fi or sci fi or whatever they call 'em, you know, these [MN] different types --
