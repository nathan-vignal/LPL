R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- playing that, but when they start going fast I can't catch 'em and ...
R:  Yeah.  I -- I tried Bingo.  I don't like it.  Soldier's okay once in a while.  But I like the games that go fast.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  You like playing the Bingo games?
L:  So, you don't play?  Yeah.  I don't win a lot though.
R:  Yeah, 'cause like, um -- I like the bumblebee --

R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]  And then I'll go oh, I'll just play games --
L:  -- and be like up all night playing.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then I'll quit, but I keep playing and playing.  Mhm.  Or if you win you wanna get a higher score.
L:  It's when you lose you wanna play until you win.
R:  I know.  It's really addicted and I'm like oh, I'm gonna cut down and I never do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  Huh?
L:  Is this your third phone call?
R:  This is the first one.  Have you done a whole bunch?

R:  And this is the first time I was home and I answered the phone.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I never did it before.
L:  Isn't it weird when you say hello and --
R:  Do you, um, chat with people on the computer?
L:  -- and then they'll -- will start talking or something?
R:  Oh.  I don't.  My kids are into that.  Yeah.  It's ...

L:  -- talking to strangers.
R:  -- but I don't do those chats if you don't know anybody, just join them.
L:  Go on and talk to my friends.
R:  It's kinda like spooky.  So, I just play games.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [PAUSE]  [LAUGH]
L:  Sometimes I will like trade pictures, but then they will like send me fake pictures of like miles of stuff.  I'm like hey, that's not you.

L:  I know that girl.  [LAUGH]  'Cause like when you send a picture online and they send only one and it's like one of those professional pictures, you know, it's not them unless they have another one to prove it.  But then this one sent me like three --
R:  That is weird.
L:  -- and it was like not her 'cause her screening said she lived in New York and that girl lives in L.A.
R:  No.  I haven't done that.  I'm like yeah ...
L:  And that girl she's not even like pretty, you know?
R:  I spend too much time on the computer playing games.  So ...
L:  Okay.  [PAUSE] Um ...  I used to do that a lot 'cause on A.O.L. you can like trade in for like -- it's like a battle [inaudible] and if you win you get like money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and like [COUGH] I used to play for hours and hours and hours and I wouldn't get off the computer and then I'd just the computer on and stuff.
R:  So, you never won anything on the games?
L:  No.  And I played and played them.
R:  Yeah.  Me neither.  My son says it's phony.
L:  I didn't know it was like a raffle ticket thing and when I found out I stopped playing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've played those, but ...
L:  Yeah.  It seems that way 'cause you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just playing for points and then you have to trade your points in --
R:  All that good prizes they give away.
L:  -- in like raffling drawing.
R:  But I keep playing the games anyway.  So, of course, it'd be really --
L:  Oh, but they're so hard to win.
R:  -- nice to win.  It'd be nice to win too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  I just play the games, but no such luck.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But somebody's gotta be winning the good prizes.
L:  Yeah.  I play it, but in a team.
R:  Sure wish it was me.  [LAUGH]  That's what people keep telling me, but I -- I don't think they can do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who knows?  I hope not.  I wanna be one of those people that wins something one day.
L:  Unless they scam everybody --
R:  I'm like yeah --
L:  -- to play their games.
R:  -- it's true, you can win good prizes.  Uh-uh.  Just like sometimes if I go to [inaudible] or something, but I haven't been in a long time.
L:  Do you gamble in real life?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I don't know nothing about cards.  I've played lots on the computer to see things.  It's okay.
L:  I like the slot machines, but I don't like playing cards --
R:  But ...
L:  -- 'cause you sit down and you get [inaudible] and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  And you don't get the mon- ...
L:  Like why are there other people [inaudible]?
R:  So, yeah, and you sit for like points or something and it's not -- not as much fun as getting quarters.
L:  Uh-huh.

R:  But using real money.
L:  Yeah.
