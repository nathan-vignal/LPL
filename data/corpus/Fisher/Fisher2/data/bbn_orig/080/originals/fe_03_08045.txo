R:  Ah, my name is Frank Rube.
L:  Hi, I'm Rocky Love.
R:  Hi, you've -- your name is Rocky.
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Do -- do you play compu- computer games?
L:  Oh, yes.  All the time.
R:  All the time?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  At night, you know, after I get my kids to bed, and --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- have a few minutes to just vegetate.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  What kind of games do you play?
L:  Well, like, mainly I go onto Pogo, on the internet.  Different things like that.  You know, the free games that they have.  Or you can play like, casino games, or, ah, just anything.  Like, kind of the nickel or quarter games that you play at the bars and the restaurants.
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  Or trivia.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just anything to give myself a little break.  Huh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How about you?
R:  Y- -- sure, sure.  I have a friend that plays Slingo a lot.  Did you play that?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I -- that -- that's actually what I started with, back probably about three years ago, on AOL.  When they actually started the Slingo craze.  I started playing that.  That w- -- that was always fun.  And also --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they have it at the casinos now.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  But, wh- what do you --
R:  I guess he got into the craze, and I think he stayed with it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  Nah, you can only do the same thing so many times.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  What do you play?
R:  Oh, I don't play many computer games.  Just what the kids -- you know, what the -- what the kids play.  You know?  Ah, ah, we play a lot of, ah, let's see -- I played, ah, Sponge Bob here, last week.
L:  Oh, from the -- from the, ah --
R:  From the cartoon.
L:  Right.
R:  You know the Sponge Bob.  My, ah, my son has, ah, has, ah, ah, the, ah, Playstation two.
L:  Oh, okay.  We ha- -- yeah, we have the X Box.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we just got, you know, the Finding Nemo game.
R:  Sure.
L:  'Cause my -- my kids are too small.  So, we have to get things that are oriented towards their level.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  But, no, I don't -- I h- haven't gotten into that at all [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  I'm more into, you know, what's online.
R:  Sure.
L:  Nothing that I have to worry about.
R:  The casino games.  Do you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you play the roulette, and all of that, on the casino games, too?
L:  No.  Nothing like that.  But, like the Keno --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or the Blackjack.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  Different things like that.  I mean, Blackjack, at least you're using your brain a little bit, to where you're able to think about different things.
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.  Right.
L:  But, ah --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- no, just, ah, they have Pogo out there, which is a free --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- free system.  Through like, AOL and Compuserve.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And you can go on, and they have all sorts of different, neat games, like, ah, they have a casino area, but then they also have golf, and bowling, and pool, and different things that you can try.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah --
R:  I would imagine, though, if you're playing against other players, you're -- you're playing against some pretty good people out there, aren't there?  Aren't you?
L:  Sometimes.  I -- a lot of times on the games I play, it's individual, and you're just thrown into a group, like, ah, they have chat rooms going on in addition to it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But yeah, I -- I just play the games.  But you look at the other people's scores that they have out there, and I don't know if they stay on all day, or [LAUGH] --
R:  I w- -- [LAUGH] --
L:  Because I don't understand how they get so many points.  To where they can keep going.  But you can take your points and cash 'em in and buy like, lottery type drawing tickets that they do every day.
R:  Uh-huh.  I see.
L:  For different amounts of money.  So you don't win money, but you -- you win the chances to win money.
R:  I see.
L:  But I -- I don't get into the, ah, the casino actual games --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- that they have out there.  But they keep sending you little notes to join.  Give 'em your credit card number, and then come play [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, yeah.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Give -- give 'em your credit card number.  That's probably what they want, right?  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I -- and you could get into too much trouble that way.
R:  Yeah, you bet.
L:  Not only with them getting your credit card number, but you spending money.  Just like going to Atlantic City, or Las Vegas [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.  Huh.
L:  Next thing you know, ah, you're done.
R:  But you know, I don't -- I don't mind a little bit of gambling.  You know?  But I don't know.  When you gamble in Las Vegas, it's a whole lot different than gambling in your living room.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Especially when you're there face to face and you're not electronically, ah, y- you know, like, somebody dealing the cards.  You have a little bit more of a feel for it than a computer spitting out the cards.  So --
R:  Ah, sure.  That's right.  That's exactly right.
L:  Ah, ah, being face to face is a lot different.
R:  The -- you got -- you bet.  It's what makes it feel a whole lot different.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, anyway, I'm not a big gambler, anyway.
L:  No.
R:  You know?  But, ah -- but, ah -- but I still like to get on -- you know, I get a lot of -- I -- I download some, ah, games.  You know, ah, into -- into my computer, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But I go to --
L:  So you can play -- you play 'em offline.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Games that, you know, I get from ZD Dead or someplace.  Or Download dot com.
L:  Right.
R:  Or someplace like that.  And, ah, put it on here.  You know, we play, ah, we, ah -- we just play offline, you know?  But, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  But -- but there's a couple that are real, you know, we can't seem to get away from.  And, ah, we gotta have our share of, ah -- of, ah -- one's called Double Solitaire.  You know?  And --
L:  Okay.
R:  And it -- it's just a simple little solitaire game, but it's nerve racking, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  That's what -- ah, every once in a while, I'll go back and, you know, the basic computers that are -- the basic games like, ah, solitaire and Freecell.  Every once in a while, if I have nothing else to do, and I'm just completely bored, I go on and do the Freecell.  And, you know, the classics are -- are the best way to go sometimes.
R:  Sure, sure.  Sure the --
L:  Just to refresh ya.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Now, I had a friend that showed me how to play Freecell here a couple of years ago, and, ah, I -- I've been kinda stuck on it, too.  I kinda go between the two [LAUGH], you know?  So --
L:  Right, right.  It's addictive.
R:  It -- it is.  It is.
L:  It's very addictive.  Especially if you make one wrong move, and then you're like, "Ah, --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- should have done that differently".  But --
R:  Yeah.  That's right.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's one of those things, once you get completed -- when you get an actual deck completed, you just have that sense of accomplishment, I think.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  What part of the country do you live in?
L:  In Delaware.
R:  Oh, in Delaware? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, o- okay.  I was thinking, you know, maybe, ah, down south, or even -- even in Delaware, you know, some of the -- some of the games -- the computer games may be NASCAR oriented, too.  'Cause, you know, d- -- but the way the south is with NASCAR an racing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- my goodness.
L:  Right.  No, I'm -- I'm a Floridian, so [LAUGH] -- by birth, and by r- -- we just moved up here, three years ago.  And it -- it's -- I don't -- I've never noticed too much down there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Really.  Ah, any more so than like -- I guess North Carolina, and Virginia, and that area's really heavily that way.  But up here, I mean, we've got Dover Downs.  But not very much NASCAR oriented games and stuff, up here.
R:  I see.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, down south, you know, n- -- like you said, in North Carolina, you know, they, ah -- I guess they're born and raised with it, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Right [LAUGH].  Right.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Definitely get a different -- different feel for it there.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.
L:  Yeah.  Up here it -- I guess, mainly it's the whole -- everything's basketball oriented.  Or, actually, it's real seasonal.
R:  [NOISE] Oh?
L:  'Cause right now, since the Phillies are doing so good, I've been notice -- noticing a lot of, ah, advertisements for different baseball type games, and things like that.  And when the Sixers were doing good, it was up there.  So, I think it's mainly sports oriented.
R:  Yeah, you're probably right.  We have the same thing here.  I'm in Washington State, and the Miners are doing real well.
L:  Oh, my goodness [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  Clear across the country [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  Ah, yeah.  And, ah, well, you know, in baseball, the Miners are doing real well, you know, so, ah, you know, they advertise a lotta -- a lotta baseball games, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  Around here, and --
L:  Yeah, they -- I think they ride the -- the hype for it.  Because with -- with Tampa Bay, you know, going to the Super Bowl, and everything --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm, mhm.
L:  Down there, it was mainly all, you know, whatever you could get your hands on for the Madden football games, or anything like that.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  Up here they just -- it's -- I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Philadelphia -- the area's just completely different than the rest of the country [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Well, I know it is.  I, ah, I have -- I'm in there -- the area, there.  I was, ah, I was born in Pennsylvania, so I know -- I know a little bit about it, you know?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know?  So --
L:  Yeah, what part of Pennsylvania?
R:  In Lancaster.
L:  That's where I just moved from.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  I just moved from the -- e- -- l- -- ah.  East Petersburg.
R:  East Petersburg.
L:  Yup.
R:  Well, I'll be darned.  Gee whiz.
L:  I just -- we just moved here a month ago.  Down to Wilmington, s- -- ah, 'cause my husband company transferred him.
R:  I see.  Uh-huh.
L:  So we -- we got packed up and moved down here, and just settling in.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I was actually in Lancaster last Wednesday.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.  Mhm.
L:  Went up to see my dad.  And went up to my old job, to say Hi to everybody.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- go up there.  So --
R:  Well, I graduated from school [inaudible] there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know, and --
L:  Well, the -- the place I used to work at was in Manheim.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  And my father in law actually went -- graduated from Township. 
R:  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  So, that --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  We're all in that area, right now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But my husband was the manager at the Outback Steakhouse there.
R:  Oh.
L:  Right off Oregon Pike.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Sure, sure.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- we're always up there [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, gee whiz.  Well, good.
L:  Yeah, it -- it -- it was really bad, last week.  I don't know i- if you remember the, ah, scent, this time of year [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Oh, my.  Yeah.
L:  We got out of the car, and I was like, "Oh, my goodness, I am so glad we moved out of Lancaster County" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Because it was ninety five --
