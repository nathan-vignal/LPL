R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Wendy.
L:  Hi, I'm Laurie.
R:  Hey, where are you from?
L:  I am in Chicago, Illinois.
R:  Oh, I'm in Alabama.
L:  Oh, okay.  I have a good friend in Alabama.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you?  I'm in Mobile.
L:  Oh, okay, she's in, ah -- she's near Birmingham, she's in Trussville.
R:  Oh, I know exactly where that is.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about movies.
L:  Right.  Right, and I'm trying to think, um, ah -- I think the first question was, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you prefer to go to a theater or to rent movies?
R:  I -- I actually prefer to rent movies.  I --
L:  You know, I do too.  I --
R:  It's --
L:  -- just think it's more comfortable.
R:  [NOISE] Right, and I -- yeah, my children don't necessarily like to sit through a whole movie at one time and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and it's less expensive to rent and bring it home and have snacks here.
L:  Right.  See, and that's why I think that's my whole -- my whole thing too, is, ah, I know, you know -- I'm not sure how it runs there, but I know here the, ah, movie theater prices are just, they're absolutely outrageous --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, I think for and adult ticket it's up to about nine dollars to nine fifty now.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, and it's, you know, if you go and, you know -- if go as a family, you're -- even the kids tickets, I think, are six to six fifty.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you're spending thirty -- you know, thirty plus dollars to get in the door --
R:  Right.  Last time --
L:  -- and then the concessions.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, last time we went, we actually saw the Scooby Doo movie, so it's been a long time, but, um -- and we -- I think we got two popcorns and maybe two large drinks and a pack of candy and it's like forty dollars total.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly, and it just gets, you know, you, for what you're paying for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- popcorn at one of the movie theaters, you can go and you can buy the box of the microwave popcorn and get four -- four packets in there for --
R:  Right.
L:  -- less than what you're paying for one bucket of popcorn [LAUGH] so.
R:  Right, without all the fat.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, you know, and it's, you know, the same thing with the, ah -- with the pop, you know.  If you order a large, you know, you're paying the same price for -- or you're paying more for a large pop than you're paying for a two liter of pop at the store, you know, [LAUGH] so it --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- it just doesn't, ah -- it just doesn't make sense at all, you know, it --
R:  I know.
L:  -- I would just much, much prefer to, ah -- to watch a movie in the comfort of my own home.
R:  Right, and my husband doesn't even en- enjoy really going out to movies, um, even if we take a -- a night out, that's -- that's just not something we ever do.
L:  Yeah, you know, that's funny because it's when -- you know, when we get -- do get a rare chance to go out too, just the two of us, it's not the first thing that comes to mind.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, in seeing a movie, because we do, we wait for everything to come out, you know, if we really want to see something, especially now, things come out so quickly --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on video that, you know, why not, you know, why spend eighteen, even for two people, why spend twenty five dollars to go sit in a movie theater and, when you can go rent the movie for what, three fifty?
R:  Right.
L:  And then you can still, you can have ten people sit and watch it so [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, so I just, ah -- just much, much prefer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to, ah -- to rent movies.
R:  Me too.  What was the last movie you saw at the theater?
L:  Um, at the theater, oh, my gosh, it had to have -- it had to have been a kids movie, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think it was the one with the, ah -- with the kangaroo, the Kangaroo Jack --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's that last movie that we saw, um --
R:  Yeah, I haven't seen that one yet.
L:  -- in the theater.  Actually, um, my husband, they just went last week and they saw The Rugrats Movie --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I didn't go to that, so I guess I -- I don't count on [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- commenting on that one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, last one I saw, like I said, was Scooby Doo and before that it was A Bugs Life so I mean, I really do not enjoy the movies at all --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the kids, you know, they -- they'll watch a movie two or three -- if I rent it they'll watch it two or three times.
L:  Well, see, exactly, and that's the other -- that's the other thing, is that, um, you know, we -- if there's movies that come out that -- you know, that are really good kid movies --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we can -- I'm not sure if you, ah -- I've just found this lately, that we can go to our library and you can rent them just like a book --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and you don't pay anything and they're --
R:  No, I didn't know that.
L:  -- they're pretty recent movies too.  And now they even have the, ah -- the DVDs, which really surprised me the last time I went in --
R:  Yeah.  No I haven't --
L:  -- to the library.
R:  -- I -- I do everything on the computer, I haven't been at the library in ages.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, tha- -- you know, that is just -- I had, you know, only gone to the library basically to get books --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I saw, you know, videos and I thought, "Oh, this is probably just all these books on tape and stuff like that", and I started looking and, I mean, just all the -- all the kids stuff they have on video and, you know, you re- -- you check them out just a library book and you get them for three weeks.
R:  Wow, I'll have --
L:  You know.
R:  -- to go look at that, yeah.
L:  Oh yeah, they have, you know, all the kids stuff and they can watch it over and over for three weeks and it's, you know, the beauty of it is it's -- it's not going to cost you anything.
R:  Wow, and --
L:  You know, that's -- that's the cool part so -- but, um, you know, like I said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just -- I think these movie theatres now -- we have one that is, ah -- we actually, when we have gone, we go to one of the ones that has like the multiple screens, you know, they're all real big --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now there's one actually right in our town that, the movies were not, ah, they were not first run, they would come out, like, a little bit later --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it was, all shows were two dollars, now that we kind of -- you know, we took advantage of that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it was, you know, it was cost effective for a family but now they've decided to run first run movies --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so they've even raised their prices --
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  -- but see, they haven't raised them, you know, we can go to a theatre that takes us ten minutes to get to and it's nine fifty for adults --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or we can go watch the same movie at this theater now that takes us two minutes to get to and it's six dollars for adults.
R:  Huh, no --
L:  So, it really makes me wonder how they can do that too.
R:  Right.  Yeah, we have a dollar movie theater and it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's the same, it's not the first run movies, but it's not in the greatest location --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's -- you know, it's a lot of teenagers, so when you go in it's loud, it's [LAUGH] you know, it's --
L:  Yes, exactly.  Exactly, and that's -- I've found that with the dollar, you know, we actually used to live in Michigan and we had a dollar movie theater near us and it was the same thing, it was all the kids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it was, um, you know, it was kind of -- in that case, I think it was kind of a, ah, you get what you pay for type movie theater.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] Which brings us back to I'd rather -- I'd rather just rent.  Now I do rent, um, DVDs on line through Netflix.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, have you heard of that?
L:  I -- you know, I've heard of it but I'm not quite sure how it works.
R:  Well, they have -- we have a lap top that has a DVD player --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so when we -- when we travel at all, I'll rent the DVDs, um, for the kids for in the car.  But Netflix, they'll send you three DVDs at a time, you keep them as long as you want, um, realistically you could rent, probably twelve different movies per month and it -- the cost was twenty dollars and that --
L:  Really.
R:  -- includes sh- -- yes, that includes shipping both ways.
L:  Oh, my gosh. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, it -- it -- that's just Netflix dot com?
R:  Yes.
L:  I'll have to look at that -- I'll have to look at that.  Um, we have, ah, like I said, I mean, we're not real huge -- you know, I know some people who are just huge, huge, huge movie people --
R:  Yeah, we're not.  No, we're not.
L:  -- and we're not, you know, and we, ah, in fact, we don't have a DVD player, but we discovered that there was a -- a little add on kit, my son has the X Box --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and there was a little -- there's a little adapter, which instead of buying a DVD at Christmas time, I just bought them the little adapter for thirty dollars [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you can watch the DVDs on the X Box.
R:  Right, that --
L:  So, you know, that's what we do, because, I mean, it just doesn't even -- that's how little, you know, it -- I can't tell you the last time that I've really even used the VCR.
R:  Ah, no we -- we rent movies, yeah, three or four movies a month and we'll generally rent 'em all at one time and keep 'em and watch 'em and take 'em back and then the next month we'll rent more.  Um, we're all on the computer so much that -- my husband's the big TV watcher --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the kids all like to watch Animal Planet or N- Nickelodeon anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah. Oh, I know, that's my -- my house is Nickelodeon, like, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whenever -- whenever the TV is on, that's what it's on.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  So, but I don't know, I -- I know that -- I think, yeah, ah, ch- childless couples probably go to the movies more.
L:  You know, I think you're right.  I -- I think, you know -- but we have -- like I know I have some neighbors and they have -- well, they have three kids and every new movie that comes out, they are there and it's -- I just don't, you know, I think --
R:  I don't see it.  [NOISE]
L:  -- my god, how can a family of five just --
R:  Afford, yeah.
L:  -- got to cost them over a hundred dollars.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't see it [LAUGH] I'd rather --
L:  No.
R:  -- spend it somewhere else.
L:  Yeah.  I -- yeah, exactly, I would rather spend it somewhere else, and if it's something that I've seen a preview for that interests me then I'd rather wait the, I mean, now it's like, what, only about three weeks --
R:  Right.
L:  -- until they come out on video anyway, so, you know, it just doesn't i- -- I guess it actually kind of blows my mind, how so many movie theaters can still be so crowded.
R:  Right.  And, um -- and movie theaters are still being built too, I mean, like crazy.
L:  Oh, I know, I know.  In fact they just -- ah, not far from us, they just built a, ah, --another huge one, it's got like --
