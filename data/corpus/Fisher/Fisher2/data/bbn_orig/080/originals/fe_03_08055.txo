R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Christine.
R:  Hi, this is Lavon.
L:  Hello.
R:  Where -- what state are you in?
L:  California.
R:  Oh, I'm in Washington.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Same side.
R:  Quite true.  Yeah.  I think you might be a west coast person.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, have you -- have you played computer games before?
L:  I have played computer games.  I'm not a huge computer game person and that's just 'cause I don't have a lotta time to do much of anything like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  If I was retired or something I would probably play them more.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  I have played one computer game that I used to play, that I was really addicted to was Dark Stone.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  That's my dog speaking in the background to her toy.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], I don't know if you've ever played that.
R:  No.  I've never heard of it.  What is it?
L:  Um, you're a wizard or something like that and there's different characters in the game and you [NOISE] -- I don't know -- you're collecting jewels, you're doing all this stuff, and you have to bring people back to life and it's really --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- like a game that you play with a group of people and so you -- I -- I was gonna say I haven't ever played any of them on the Internet like they were asking.  I've never played them over the Internet.  My friends have done that and my husband's done it, um, but I've just played them where you play 'em at home connected to [NOISE] computers with other people.  So ...
R:  So, your computer's connected with other people?
L:  Yeah.  You put in a -- what's it called? -- a certain chip that, um, let's you network a couple of computers, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, mostly they're played with a support one.
R:  Like an Internet type of thing or something?
L:  Yeah.  But never over the Internet -- Internet.
R:  Not anybody you didn't really know kinda thing, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that sounds fun though.
L:  So ...  And what was that other one?  Um [LIPSMACK], oh, the Sims.
R:  Oh, Sim City?
L:  Have you ever heard of that?
R:  That Sim City thing?
L:  Yeah.  Sim City was the very first one that came out and then from there they've made all these different ones where you've got like the Sims, the Dating Game.  So, you make your character like, um --
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  -- clean his house and go to town and work a job and then he's got to try to date in the meantime and get married and have kids.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, they've got this whole complex thing now.  You can add all these different ones, um ...
R:  So, you've played that?
L:  Yes.
R:  And is that a group game or is that individual?
L:  That's individual I think.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't think you can play it as a group.  I never have.  I've only played that by myself.  And, again, that's another addicting one that takes a lotta time.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  That's the problem with the games.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know, the more I think about it the more I realize I have played a lotta computer games actually.
R:  Well, that's only a couple.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I also have --
R:  You have other ones?
L:  -- Zoo Tycoon [LAUGH] --
R:  What -- what was that?
L:  -- that I play where you actually -- you create a zoo.  They give you all these different animals that you can buy and you start out with so much money and they, um -- you have to create the exhibits for 'em and the animals are only happy if you create the exhibit correctly.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, if you've got a lion you have to give him the right rocks and the right --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- amount of water versus dirt and all that stuff --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then as you get more and more people come to your zoo and you have to give 'em exhibits and ferris wheels and those sorta things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that's a fun one too.
R:  Ah, I haven't heard of that one at all.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, at first I think you -- like just, uh, the sports games, which I never play --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- or the ones that you play over the Internet, the violent ones, and I don't play any of those.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  Just seems like there's a lotta those.  I don't like those either.  [LAUGH]
L:  I also have one of those card game things on my computer.  So, I've done all those Solitaire games.
R:  Right.
L:  All those.  So, have you ever played any computer games or ...?
R:  I haven't done it with any -- I haven't done it with any other people.  I've done, um -- I did all the same, like you, the computer -- you know, the computer ones that are on the computer and -- but, um, um, my sister was telling me oh, you should look at these ones that are -- like, you know, they're on all these different game sites, like Yahoo and all those and so I went in there to see what she was talking about 'cause she said -- she said, "Have you ever played this game?  'Cause I'm addicted" and so I went -- had to go look at it to see what it was [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  -- and, um -- which of course now I can't remember the name of it -- but, um, anyway we played -- I played it for a little while, but it was so stressful --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that I was like oh, my goodness, I've got to stop playing this.  It was -- it was like tense.  You know what I mean?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Oh, I know, one of 'em was called Collapse --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it's just a -- it starts off really slow like, um -- I'm trying to think of what -- something is like that ...
L:  Kinda like a Tetras one?
R:  Yeah.  That's exactly what I was gonna say.  Sorta like that, but it gets going ridiculously fast where your arm can't -- your hand can't move fast enough, you know, that kinda thing.
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  And it's like how do people get those ridiculously high scores?  It's -- I -- I just don't get it.  How is it possible?  That kinda thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, I was doing that for a while and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that was the one that she was addicted too was that one --
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  -- and then, um, um, my daughter was doing, um, some word ones.  There's w- -- I -- word -- I don't remember what it -- what it was now.  It was some type of country western type of background something.  But, anyway ...
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  Word Wrangler I think it was.
L:  Huh.
R:  And, um, anyway, you just had to put words together and I thought well, now, this is good 'cause your brain is actually having to think of words.  So, this is -- this is better.  [LAUGH]  You know what I mean?
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's not just speed.  It's like your -- your brain's working.  So, that's probably better.  So -- and that was not stressful like --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the other one.  I mean, there was still some time things, but it wasn't anything like the other one.  So -- but, again, those don't -- I -- I didn't play with other people or anything like that, you know?  But it was still, you know, fun and I, you know [SIGH], I -- it'd be great if I could, you know, play for fifteen or twenty minutes a day would be really nice.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But I just -- just -- just seems like I'm just working all the time and ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Do you work fulltime?
R:  So, well, I'm just trying to start a business.  Um [LIPSMACK], I -- we -- we moved not too long ago and so I was trying to see what our new -- we -- you know, we went from a town of a -- a hundred thousand to a town of seventeen hundred.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, quite a difference.
R:  Yeah.  And I'm originally from the L.A. area.  So --
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  -- we are really -- this is, you know, quite different --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, around Eastern Washington in a r- remote place.  But, you know, we have -- you know, we have grocery stores and everything like that at least --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and pharmacies and a hospital here and everything.  But it's still really little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK], but anyway so I wanted to -- I didn't wanna step on toes, I wanted to find out, you know, who's doing what and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kind of -- you know, you want every- -- you wanna be accepted 'cause [LAUGH] I don't want ...
L:  Right.
R:  So, anyway -- so ...
L:  In a town like that especially.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  You need friends.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  So ...
L:  Ah.
R:  Anyway, so I'm looking -- I'm looking forward to it.  I've working out of my, uh -- out of a bedroom and so I've finally convinced my husband that I really need to convert our garage so I could meet people at the house, uh, that's -- I'm just gonna try to do it from my house.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But out here it's okay to have home based businesses 'cause a whole bunch of people do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  No big deal here, you know?  So -- but I'd rather meet people in, uh, it's own entrance instead of coming into my living room, you know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, that's -- that's what I prefer.  So, he finally agreed.  So, I'm excited that I get to do that, but all our -- I'm -- I'm just -- I've got so much to do it's unbelievable.  Every day it's just like -- and we had, you know, com- -- when you have company -- company all weekend, you know, it's just like oh, now we're just doing catch ups from all the things we didn't get done before the company [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- before they arrived.  So, it's just -- I'd love to be on -- you know -- and I'm sorta jealous that -- like, my husband can just work his job regular, in the day time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and come home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and play on the computer at night --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and he plays -- you know, he usually just plays, um -- what's the one that's not Solitaire? -- Free Cell.  So ...
L:  Yes.  My mother loves Free Cell.
R:  Yeah.  My husband just ...
L:  I am no good at it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I am terrible at it.
R:  Really?
L:  I've tried and tried and tried.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I like that.  In fact my, um -- a couple of relatives in my family have started at the -- started and -- and put numbers in and start with number one and they're just trying to go through every single one of them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Not just a random thing, you know?  Just like I'm gonna try 'em all.
L:  Actually try it.  Wow!
R:  Oh.  So, then they write down the ones that they got stumped on so they can go back --
L:  Oh, my!
R:  -- or tell other people try this one 'cause I can't get through that one, you know, that kinda thing.  So ...
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  But, see, th- that -- one person's retired and the other one's got little kids and she does that when she's -- you know, when she was nursing and, you know, that kinda stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  When they have time.
R:  That's right.  But, huh, I know I ...
L:  If I ever stay home I will do the same thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I got to play Freecell about a -- a week ago because my son gave me his laptop to take in the car and I went oh, I could play a game.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, how exciting.
R:  So, that was fun for me.  It was like oh, other people do this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you ever played the Minesweeper one?
R:  Yes.
L:  The bomb one?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's the one I just love.
R:  Yeah.  That's a good one too.  I like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's the one I can sit there and kinda zone while I'm playing it.
R:  Yeah.  It's ...
L:  If I'm not feeling good or whatever I'll go play Minesweeper.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's a good i- -- that's a good idea.  Well, I know, um, one of my other -- my husband's, uh -- sister in law -- yeah -- just she was playing ones for money online.  You know how you can do games and stuff and have -- you put money in there and it's basically gambling and ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow!  No.  I haven't heard of that.
R:  Yeah.  You can do gambling and stuff.
L:  On the Internet?
R:  On the Internet.  Yep.  So, she was doing that, which is really --
L:  Well, that could get addicting.
R:  -- which is really -- really not good.  [LAUGH]
L:  That could get very addicting.  [LAUGH]
