L:  Hi, this is Mel.  [NOISE] 
R:  This is Stacey.  [PAUSE]  Hello.
L:  Hi, Stacey?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi, this is Mel.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Oh, not to bad.  So, do you like going to the movies and theaters?
R:  Um, oh no, like, I think either way's good, just kind of depends on [NOISE] -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the night, you know.
L:  Oh, I haven't been to an actual theater in probably close to five years.  I have two little kids, so [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we go to the drive ins or we end up renting them after they come out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The last movie I went and saw was Hollywood Homicide and it was horrible.
L:  Hadn't heard of that one.  Um, [LIPSMACK]  we've been to see a few at the drive in lately.  We've seen Daddy's Daycare, which was great, [NOISE] um, X Men Two.
R:  Ha.
L:  Have you seen that one yet?
R:  No.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, did you see the first one?
R:  No.
L:  No.  [LAUGH] What type of, ah, movies do you enjoy?
R:  Um, comedies or like -- probably comedies are my favorite.
L:  [NOISE] Daddy Daycare's a good one, ah --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- oh, really great with Eddy Murphy.
R:  I'll have to check that out.
L:  [NOISE] Great comedy.  Even the kids enjoyed that one.  Oh.
R:  Wha- what was the second question?  I don't even remember.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I didn't catch it either.  This is my first --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- first call on this, so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, this is mine too, 'cause they've never been able to get a hold of me, so.
L:  Mm, ah, we keep, um, waiting for some more good ones to come out.  What have you seen previews that looks good?
R:  Um, I want to see Charlie's Angels Two.
L:  Oh yeah, I'd forgotten about that one.
R:  And I want to see Legally Blond Two.
L:  Yeah, that one, we might go see.  I wasn't too impressed with the first Legally Blond though.
R:  Really, I liked it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I want to be a lawyer and I want to go to Harvard so it's just like, I don't know, it's just -- it's just cool to like see everything, you know, like -- like the class rooms and the campus and all that stuff, just, I don't know.
L:  Right.  I guess I -- I wasn't too thrilled with the movie because it portrayed her as really stupid [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, it did.
L:  -- and didn't -- didn't give me a good sense of, you know, women and law.  I know that, you know, there are a lot of successful women lawyers out there but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it kind of made everyone look stupid.
R:  [LAUGH] Have you seen any previews?
L:  I haven't, um, not that I can really think of.  I know the kids have been --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bothering me to see that new Rugrats movie.
R:  Ah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  I have a two year old and a five year old.
R:  [NOISE] Rugrats.
L:  Yeah, we -- we won't see that one.  My husband doesn't like Rugrats.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, we try to get to the drive in 'cause they usually have the first one is geared towards kids and then after the kids fall asleep you get to have a second movie for the adults.
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  Yeah, isn't too bad.
R:  [NOISE] Trying to remember what that second question was.
L:  Ah, something about d- do you like to go to the theaters or wait until it comes out, and then one of my kids screamed and I didn't catch the rest.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hm, oh, my goodness, we're like half way through the conversation and neither one of us can remember the second question.
R:  I know.
L:  That's bad.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] No good, they -- I don't know, it should replay or something.
L:  Mm.  That would be helpful.  [PAUSE] So, do you watch a lot of movies at home, from rentals or --
R:  Yeah, I like -- I've already watched most of all the new releases, [LAUGH] but --
L:  [COUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- last night I rented, um, Pelican Brief and Body Shot.
L:  Hm, haven't heard of Body Shot.  [MN] Is Pelican Brief, um, is that with Julia Roberts?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, we've seen that --
R:  But --
L:  -- one.  [NOISE] But we have, um -- trying to think of some of the, ah, ah, more geared towards adult recent ones that we've gotten.  Let me see [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  -- oh, The Tuxedo, that was a good comedy.  Did you see that one?
R:  Was it?  Uh-uh, I haven't seen it.
L:  Um, you like Robin Williams at all?
R:  Ah, yeah, he's pretty funny.
L:  We, um -- we have One Hour Photo, it wasn't a comedy but it was actually really good, and it's different from what you expect to see Robin Williams in.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  And, um, Catch Me If I -- If You Can, that was funny with Leonardo.
R:  Oh yeah, that was good.
L:  I liked that one.
R:  Me too.
L:  Ah, Kate And Leopold, that's not new though.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm sitting here looking at my DVDs going, "What was good?"  [PAUSE] Hm.  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Mm.  Oh, Hot Chick, did you see that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- with Rob Steiner.  [LAUGH]
R:  That was funny.
L:  Oh I loved that one.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that was really funny.
L:  I think in was Deuce Bigelow, watch both of them on the same night and you're all set.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, those are classics.  I don't re- -- nothing beats, like, Ace Ventura and Dumb And Dumber though, those are just like -- I don't know, those are such good movies I think.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I can't belie- --
R:  Have you seen the new Dumber And Dumbers.
L:  I was just going to say, I haven't seen it but I've seen the previews for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is that a rip off, or is that from the same ones who did Dumb And Dumber?
R:  It's different, like, actors, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- supposed to be like Dumber, it's supposed to be the same people, like, but back in high school.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's like going backwards.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I knew when we saw the preview that it wasn't Jim Carrey but it looked similar to him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I wondered if it was the same, you know, executive producers and stuff.
R:  I don't even know.
L:  It might be worth seeing, it looks pretty funny.
R:  Yeah, it does.  [PAUSE]
L:  Wow ... um, is there anything good coming out for the fourth of July weekend that you've heard?
R:  Um, just Legally Blond Two and, um, [LIPSMACK] Charlie's Angels Two.
L:  That looks good.
R:  Maybe not.
L:  [LAUGH] Hopefully the drive in will be open with Charlie's Angels.
R:  You think they're going to be open on fourth of July?
L:  Um, they seem to be open on holidays, it's -- we're up here in Maine, so it's seasonal from like May to September, but I think --
R:  Oh, lucky in Maine.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Gees, that -- I want to live there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  [LIPSMACK] Do you eat a lot of -- a lot of seafood?
L:  Ah, not too often.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm probably one of the few people in Maine who doesn't like lobster.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I love lobster but I'm in Las Vegas.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, so, we're not real close to too much seafood.
L:  [NOISE] No, no.  Must be happening down there though.  Kind of seems like Hicksville up here.
R:  Huh.
L:  It really --
R:  Yeah, it's pretty -- pretty crazy stuff down here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's always something going on.
L:  Mm, we have, um -- we have one, what is it?  Like, Chunkys[?] or something, it's a movie place in town, one of those ones, I've never even been in it but you go in and you sit down and you order food while you're watching the movie.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, that -- but that's the only --
R:  I don't think we have anything like that here.
L:  -- that's the only thing we have here.  You have to go out of town to go any place else and there's, probably small on your scale but to us it's a big theater, in the next town over, it has, like, eight different cinemas inside of it.  Mm, that's about it, not much up here in Maine.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  We have movie theaters all over the place, and like every movie theater has like forty theaters in it.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, I keep hearing a lot about I max theaters but we don't have any.
R:  Oh, we have one of those.
L:  We don't have them up here.  Are they cool?
R:  They're pretty cool.  Yeah, they're really cool.  We have one at Caesar's Palace and it's -- it's cool.
L:  Huh.  Do you think it's better than, you know, watching a movie on a regular big screen or?
R:  It depends on what you watch, because, like you have to like look up at the ceiling all the time, you know, because it's like all around you, so it's like --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- I've gone and seen like things for school there, like solar system movies or movies about the stars and stuff, you know.  I've never seen an actual, like movie there, just like documentary, like educational films.
L:  Right, that'd be --
R:  But, I mean I --
L:  -- probably cool to see a, you know, new release in an I max then if it's all around you, kind of like surround sound, only surround picture.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they -- they've been playing like, ah, motor cross movies and stuff like that in there a lot.
L:  Huh. --
