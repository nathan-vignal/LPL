R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hello.
R:  My -- hi, ah, ah, my name's Chris.  I'm in Texas, where are you?
L:  I'm in Texas also.
R:  Oh, really w- m- m- --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- man, that's surprising isn't it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I think it's the first time that's happened to me.
L:  Yeah, I'm in east Texas.
R:  Oh, you're in ea- -- oh, we're in Houston.
L:  Houston, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was just down there.
R:  Oh, really.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, somebody -- one of my friends is at M.D. Anderson[?], I went to visit them.
R:  Oh, oh, okay.  Well, they want us to talk about movies, so, um, I --
L:  I love to go to the movies.
R:  You do?
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, we -- we -- we don't really go that often, my son does, but, ah, we, ah -- my husband and I don't, we'd prefer, I guess, to rent or, we have satellite so we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes we do that.  I mean, it's nice experience, but it's so expensive any more.
L:  Yeah, it is, that's true but --
R:  I mean, by the time you, ah, you know, ah, get the movie, get the proverbial popcorn --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get the proverbial drink [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] Right, you've got to have popcorn and a drink.
R:  -- I mean, you might as well go out to dinner.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.  But I -- I just love to go, I'd rather see it at -- the movie at the theater than on -- than at home on TV.
R:  Yeah, that's, you know, that is true, 'cause, I mean, I think, ah -- well, it depends on the movie though I think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot of times too, 'cause some of them, you almost have to watch on the big screen so --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- to speak.  But they just -- they've made it so, you know, um -- I don't know, they've just made it, um, expensive I think --
L:  They really have, yeah.
R:  they -- they -- yeah, and then again, you know, you have to be careful where you go and then you have, --I don't know, a lot of times I've -- I don't necessarily like all the other people that are going, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Because sometimes you get not, ah, you know, ah -- but it might be different where you live.  Is it that way as well over there or?
L:  Ah, I don't usually go when they first put a movie out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, 'cause I don't want to get in the crowds and all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'll wait several weeks or a month or so and then I'll go when it -- I don't like to go when it's real crowded, I like to go when the movie's, you know, kind of died down and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, and go, you know, when --
R:  Do they -- but then -- th- d- -- they -- do you have, like, dollar cinemas over there?
L:  Ah, yeah, but I don't, [MN] -- I don't -- I've usually seen the movie by the time it gets to there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but in the afternoon, ah, until five o'clock, we can pay five dollars.
R:  Oh yeah, there's the, yeah, the, ah, matinee kind of thing.
L:  Yeah, the matinee.  So, I usually go to that and --
R:  Yeah, my son does a lot more the mov- -- of course, that's ah, you know, I think, you know, socialization or whatever; he's a teenager.
L:  Right, yeah, that's what I like -- usually me and, um, some of my girlfriends go or, you know -- my husband doesn't like to go so --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- usually me and my girlfriends going out for a night and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- away from home, so that's nice.
R:  Yeah, but y- -- but then when you do that you do other things as well, like maybe dinner or, yeah, yeah, right.
L:  Yeah, we usually go out to eat and then go to the show and then we don't want the popcorn and the --
R:  Yeah, there you go, yeah.
L:  -- coke, so it works out fine.
R:  Yeah.  What do you think about the -- the kind of movies that they, ah -- that they -- they're producing nowadays.
L:  Well, a lot of them I don't care for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um --
R:  Me neither.
L:  -- I went and saw, um, Father In Law, I think that's the name of it --
R:  The Father In Law?
L:  -- The In Laws.  The In Laws, that was it --
R:  Oh, The In Laws, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- with, ah, Michael Douglas, [LIPSMACK] and it was -- it was real good.
R:  That -- was Michael Douglas in The In Laws, that was --
L:  Yeah, or --
R:  -- oh, okay, that wasn't, ah, [NOISE] oh, I don't --
L:  That wasn't the one with his dad --
R:  Oh, okay, no I --
L:  -- and it --
R:  -- w- we haven't seen that one.  I can't remember the one -- the last one that we went -- which is the last one w- [NOISE] -- we went to see Star Wars, that's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a good -- that -- I mean, I wasn't -- have never been really big on Star Wars but I figured, "Okay, this is one of those definitely big screen things", you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not a Star Wars person either.  I didn't see that one.
R:  Me [LAUGH] -- me neither.  I thought you meant, ah, when you said, um, The Father In Law, I thought you meant the one with, ah, that really funny one with, ah, what's his name?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  The curly headed guy?
R:  Yeah, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the one that was, ah, [NOISE] na, my husband's terrible for names.
L:  Yeah, I know what you're talking about, I saw --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that one, yeah --
R:  Ah, ah, but yeah, that one.
L:  -- an older movie.
R:  Yeah, it's a little bit older movie --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's, ah, where his name -- he was Jewish or something like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I remember he -- yeah, he messed up the thing, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I --
R:  Not Al Pacino, what's the other guy's name, Rob --
L:  I don't know, I can see him but I -- in my mind --
R:  I know, I know.
L:  -- but I can't -- can't put a name to him, but, yeah, I saw that one too, but --
R:  Bob De Niro, that's who it was, Bob De Niro, yeah. --
L:  Yeah, Robert De Niro, uh-huh, yeah.
R:  Robert De Niro, right, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was hilarious movie.
L:  Yeah, that was good.
R:  Yeah, that was pretty good, but, ah, yeah --
L:  I think think this one was called The In Laws, not Father In Law, but --
R:  The In Law- -- oh yeah, the other one I'm talking about is Meet the Parents --
L:  Yeah, that's right, Meet the Parents.
R:  -- the Parents, yeah.  And you're talking about In Laws.  So, was it good?
L:  Yeah, it was good.
R:  In Laws?
L:  And I went thinking, ah, this ain't going be very good, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really good for, you know --
R:  Ha.
L:  -- jus- -- I mean, I wouldn't want to see it again or anything --
R:  Right, right, mm.
L:  -- but it was good for a one time --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- fun movie, I enjoyed it.
R:  Yeah, we'd like to g- -- I think we'd like to go a little more often to the m- -- my husband works just so much, and so the little time that he has off he kind of likes, you know -- you know, spend it at home.
L:  Right.
R:  It's really hard to get him to go out and do almost anything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's how my husband is too but I go --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- now that it's summer we -- they have --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- matinees, you know and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I'll go before he even gets off work so --
R:  Yeah, oh that, yeah, well.
L:  -- so we'll go at like at two o'clock or one o'clock in the afternoon --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and come on back home. 
R:  But it's not like it used to be though, way back when, right?
L:  No, hm.
R:  Yeah.  Not -- not like, ah -- I don't know, it used to be a big thing 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now there's so many other things that people do --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- well, I mean, dinner and a show was just like, it, you know.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] 
R:  Or -- or dinner and dancing, which --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot of people don't even do that any more unless --
L:  That's right, wow.
R:  -- they wind up going to bars and that's not really all that good at -- nowadays either --
L:  No, it's not.
R:  -- so --
L:  So, that's what I do some afternoons, like about once or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- maybe twice a month, you know, or --
R:  Yeah.  Where in east Texas are you?
L:  Longview.
R:  Oh, you're in Longview?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I have -- I know some people up there.  I haven't heard from them in a while, um, Glen and Kimmy Fulton --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, you don't --
L:  No, no.
R:  -- know -- I know, it's hard -- it's like do you know the Smiths or something like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  In England, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, yeah, Longview, that's not, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's not too far from Dallas really is it?
L:  No, mhm, couple of hours drive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, yeah, I guess you're just about as hot up there as it is here.
L:  Oh, it is scorching up here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like, ah, it's in the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we had a couple of days first part of the week that was --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it was, like, high eighties but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- normally it's been middle nineties.
R:  Mm, well, that's another reason for us not to even get out and go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- see movies either, you know, I mean, just --
L:  That's right.  I don't do anything in the afternoons.  I do it in the early mornings or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- late evenings.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  I go to the grocery store in the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mornings and anything else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I need to do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just too hot to get out.
R:  Yeah.  What do you think about the movie industry though, ah, the way -- the way it's going with the -- with the -- the profanity and the --
L:  Yeah, I don't like that.
R:  -- and the perversion and all?  You know what I'm talking about?
L:  Mhm.  Ah, there's nothing for kids any more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to be able to go see.
R:  Yeah.  Have you ever, ah, watched any -- some of the Christian movies, like Omega Code and, ah, oh, gosh, what are some of the other ones?  Megiddo[?] and, you know, they're coming out with some nice, you know, family entertainment style --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- movies.
L:  No, I haven't seen those.
R:  There's one that I want to see that recently came out and it's called The Time -- [NOISE] The Time Machine, I think.  I think it's -- yeah, The Time Machine, isn't it?  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't think I've heard of that one.
R:  Yeah, it's a Christian movie, it's either so- so- ah, some g- -- it's something with -- with going back in time or going forward in time, whatever, I'd like to see that.  I'd like to see more of that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'd like to see more wholesome stuff, you know --
L:  Yeah, exac- --
R:  -- I'd like to see things more like, you know, like the old fashioned kind of movies that we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- used to watch all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That -- that didn't have really a whole bunch of weird endings that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you kind of like, "You mean I sat here for two hours for this?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I've done that before too --
R:  I mean, wha- --
L:  -- "You mean I pay good money to see these?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, if I'm gonna pay good money or if I'm gonna either rent it or go to it, I want to see a happy ending.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  That's just me, you know.
L:  Yeah, and some endings, you just sit there and go --
R:  "What?"
L:  -- "Is this the end?"  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It didn't end.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but you see, everything is so money motivated any more and so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- they -- they kind of leave you hanging 'cause --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you'll say, "Oh yeah, right, there comes the sequel".
L:  That's so -- that's so there can be a sequel, that's right.
R:  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I don't --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- um --
L:  But I -- I do wish they'd leave out -- I mean, they don't have to have all the profanity and the --
R:  Exactly, no.
L:  -- the things that they have and still have a good movie.
R:  Right.  Well, I think that they could but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they choose not to --
L:  Right, because --
R:  -- but, then again, that's this country -- a lot of it is that way and you know.
L:  Well, that's what they're selling right now, you know, people want to see that I guess.  I don't, I'm not one of them that wants to.
R:  No, well, I -- I don't see how, but it's kind of like the same thing, I don't see why people want to sit there and watch Jerry Springer or some of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- these other things.  I mean, I don't understand it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, but, you know, it's because of the almighty dollar, but you know, we can protest these things, I --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- mean I, you know -- we -- there's plenty of, you know, Don Wildman and -- and, you know, a whole bunch of different organizations that if you put enough pressure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on -- on the -- on the media and the movie industry that they might, you know, do a little bit better --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think.
L:  Well, and if people quit going to them until they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- start producing more --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- wholesome movies, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too, but.
R:  Well, you know, but then I -- sometimes I think we're kind of out numbered, don't you think?
L:  Yeah, yeah, definitely, huh.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- because, yeah, it's true, if pe- people would stop going to them, but the problem is there's so many people that are going to them.
L:  That's right --
R:  But then again --
L:  -- and want to see that stuff, but I don't.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I don't either, and then there's things, you know, that you, you know, where are their morals?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or, they don't have any.  Tha- that's what the deal is.
L:  Right.
R:  But, then again, that's a whole -nother discussion right [LAUGH]?
L:  That's right, mhm.
R:  Ah.
L:  But a lot of people are going, 'cause those movies are just filled up --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- whenever.
R:  -- Ah, yeah, I've noticed that, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't know how they can even afford it, to be honest with you, I mean, I -- how often do you go to the?
L:  Ah, once a month, maybe twice.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  You know, not much.
R:  But there's people that -- they go, you know, once --
L:  Every week, yeah.
R:  -- a week or -- or -- or twice a week sometimes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't --
L:  And, see here, when kids dating, I mean, they don't have a whole --
