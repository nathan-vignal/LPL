R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What about yourself?
R:  The bay area.
L:  Okay, ah, Oakland?  Or Frisco?
R:  Well, I'm down in -- in Burlingame.  Right out of -- about twenty miles out of San Frisco, south.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's like, [inaudible] by the airport.  Like, five minutes from the airport, down here.
L:  Yeah.  I was just recently at the airport.  Like, about two months ago.
R:  Oh, were you?
L:  Yeah, my wife and I took a little trip to, um, Frisco.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, we're -- we're about fifteen minutes, well, probably about five, ten minutes from the airport, south.  It goes like, the airport, then Millbrae, Burlingame.  [NOISE].
L:  Oh, okay [NOISE].
R:  So, then we --
L:  I've heard of Burlingame, but I don't know --
R:  Have you?
L:  -- exactly where it's at.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yes, I have.
R:  Wow [LAUGH].
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] what's the topic today?  Computer games?
R:  Yeah.  I think that's what they said.
L:  Yeah.  So, do you play computer games?
R:  Ah, I do.  I play [NOISE] -- if, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I play [SIGH], what is it?  Mah Jong [SIGH].  Like, ch- -- um, that -- I haven't done it in a while, but, I mean, if I'm not a- -- not asleep this -- at this hour [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Usually, ah, I only play where you can win for money, though.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Usually go for points, or whatever.  Um, you know, against --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- other players, or whatever.  You know, live players.
L:  Right, right.
R:  What about you?
L:  Yeah.  I play, like, um, [LIPSMACK] -- what is it?  Like, Starcraft, Warcraft.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They're -- they're more like guy games.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's -- there's a few -- few women that like to play those games.
R:  Uh-huh.  Cool.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  They're kinda like -- not so much strategy, in a way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- depending on -- on, um, how you play the game.
R:  Oh, like --
L:  It -- it -- it's kinda like, you have to, um -- you have to -- what is it?  You have to build your -- your c- -- it's not a city, really [NOISE].  It's kinda like, you have an army and you have to build it up.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then you go after other people, and you could like, ally yourself with them, and, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.
R:  Kinda like, a really revised centipede, and beyond [LAUGH].  Just sorta like the last --
L:  Way beyond.  Way beyond.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  It's -- it's like they start you off with, um --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- well there's different ones.
R:  Oh.
L:  The -- the Starcraft, that's like, my favorite one.  It starts you off with, um, minerals and gases.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And from that, you have to start building, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Cool.
L:  -- like, your factories and stuff.  And --
R:  Oh, cool.  Sounds really --
L:  Yeah.  M- my wife hates it.  'Cause like, sometimes I'm up all night, til like seven in the morning.
R:  Oh, wow.  I don't doubt it.
L:  Yeah, I stop playing -- yeah, I stop playing it when the sun comes up, actually.
R:  Wow.  So you probably don't have kids, then.
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Well, see, I have to compete.
L:  Not yet.
R:  I have to compete with my kids to get on the computer.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Oh --
L:  I have to compete with my wife.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause she -- she's like always online, chatting and doing all the stuff.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  That's my kids.  They do this, I am stuff with all their friends, and stuff.  AOL or instant messaging or whatever.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Hey.  They've got like, you know, ten screens going.  You know, ten [inaudible] boxes going up and down.  Like, how do you k- -- you know, how do you know what -- forget it.  By the time they give up, it's like, eleven o'clock, and I'm ready to like, crash, usually.  So, check my emails, and then I'm like, okay, that's it.
L:  So -- so what do you do for a living?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Kids [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  My kids.  I have a thirteen year old.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I have a thirteen year old girl, an eleven year old girl, and a four year old boy.  So, --
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, my boy very much keeps me going.  And the thirteen year old [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm --
R:  So --
L:  I'm sure it's -- it's a lot of work.
R:  It is -- I mean, they're -- they're cool.  I mean, they're -- they're good kids.  Just it's -- it's -- it is summer, now, so all the kids hang out here at our house [NOISE]. 
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  I guess that kinda makes me the cool mom on the block, which is all right.  I'd rather have 'em here [LIPSMACK].  So the --
L:  Yeah, totally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Than them doing something else, somewhere else, you know?
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean, they're -- you know, they're typical thirteen year olds.  But we got a huge trampoline on the front grass and stuff, so they're usually out there --
L:  Oh, that's so cool.
R:  -- jumping.  Yeah, there's usually -- there's -- summer just started, but usually like, fifteen kids here, at -- at all times, so --
L:  Do you ever get on the trampoline?
R:  Yeah.  I -- we have.  It's fun.  And you -- it's not if you got to wait for your time on there, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, um, you know --
L:  I mean, I love the trampoline, but ever since this one time that I tried to do a flip --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and I landed on --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- my neck --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Ever since then, I'm kinda scared of getting --
R:  Yeah, I don't doubt it.
L:  -- to acrobatical on that.
R:  See, I watch my kids and just -- I'm -- I'm in awe.  They run from -- we have like a front porch, a big front porch -- and they run, and then jump from the porch onto that, and like, do double flips and -- amazing.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  But see, they have no fear.  So far.  Knock on wood.  And [NOISE] we've had it about two years and no one's gotten hurt.  So --
L:  Oh, that's so good.
R:  But, um, you know -- what we like to do is, if we're up, like, two o'clock in the morning, ah, Burlingame Avenue's a pretty hot spot here in Burlingame.  Where -- often go get drunk and stuff.  And then they start walking home from the Avenue.  See, they sit out there at like, two thirty in the morning, or if we're sitting in, you know, the office, with the computer -- you hear the drunk people walking down the street, going, "Hey, let's go on the trampoline".  You know? [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And it's kinda cool to sit there watching.  [LAUGH] 'cause they -- they can't even get their shoes off to get on the thing.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know?  One night, we opened up the blinds, to see someone like, taking it.  Carting it away, like, trying to cart it away.  Some teenage kids --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Hey -- you know, they didn't know who we were.  'Cause everybody knows -- you know everybody around here.  But, this time round, "Hey, now, what are you doing".  They dropped it, in the middle of the street.  You know, what do you --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  The thing's heavy, and you -- really it's tall -- if you put it on it's side, the r- -- we were -- when we first got it, we were gonna put it away down the driveway, but you can't move it.  It's taller than the house.
L:  Hey, did you -- did you ever see that Simpsons episode when they had the trampoline?
R:  No, ah --
L:  Oh, my God.  It's so funny [LAUGH].
R:  You know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, they start charging, and like, the kids start getting hurt.
R:  Oh.
L:  Ah, and, um, before you know it, there's a bunch of kids -- I mean, that's not funny, that they were getting hurt --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Ah, before you know it, there's a bunch of kids with like, casts and -- and --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- bandages, all over the lawn.
R:  Knock on wood, everybody -- nobody's ever, ever gotten hurt, here.  Ever.  Thank God.
L:  Well, that's good.  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Totally.
R:  [NOISE] But, yeah, we just -- I just like to get on the computer, here at my home [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  Shouldn't have to, but I do [NOISE].  But --
L:  I'm actually in the process of building a new workstation, with like, a better video card, so that I could --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I could game.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, 'cause that -- that makes all the difference.  I -- through my experience, I've noticed, even people that have like the good, um, processors -- like the two point --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- four, and all that.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  If you have a crappy video card, you're still gonna have lag time, if you're -- if you're gaming with other people.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So -- that's my thing, I'm building --
R:  What do you do for a living?  [LAUGH].
L:  Um, I do collections.  Like, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- work comp collections.
R:  What type? [NOISE].
L:  Ah, worker's comp collections.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You see, so I'm not calling people, asking for money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm actually calling the insurance companies.
R:  That's cool.  That's good.
L:  Asking them to pay up for somebody's injury.  So --
R:  I used to do that for Crawford and Company.
L:  Oh, my God.  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I always contact Crawford and Company.
R:  Do you, in Sacramento?  Or, ah --
L:  Yes.
R:  Wow.
L:  In Sacramento.
R:  Do you know Linda Calvillo?
L:  Oh, my God [LAUGH].
R:  That's my cousin.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You know Linda?
L:  That's so trippy.  Yeah.  I --
R:  I --
L:  The thing is, that there's -- there -- I -- I'm managing about -- at least a thousand different cases.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Some of 'em date back to two thousand.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, you know, different -- different cases are for different insurance carriers.
R:  Right.
L:  And then, in each in -- different insurance carrier, I deal with their front adjuster.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- I -- I had like, about a couple of -- of -- of cases --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- w- with, ah -- with that name on the file.
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  No, I'm not.  That's so weird.
R:  Have you ever talked to her?
L:  Ah, I've left her messages.  And she hasn't called me back [LAUGH].
R:  That figures.  That figures.  We -- I mean, she's my first cousin.  We -- we get along to a point.  She, some days, gets kinda uppity.   "Yeah, you know what" -- 'cause I'm a pretty like, down to earth --
L:  Right.
R:  -- straight forward -- I mean, it -- I always try to make my kids see.  You know what, you gotta be -- you know, gotta be real.  You gotta keep things straight.  People don't, you know -- just be who you are.  Don't pretend to be something you're not, and --
L:  Totally, totally.
R:  You know, and so -- I guess my cousin don't like that --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- but that's who I am.  I mean, I guess you don't go out of your way to hurt peoples feelings.  Just, don't lie, don't -- you know, just be cool.  I -- I mean, you know, everybody's [NOISE] -- everybody's the same.  Inside and out, regardless.  They have feelings, they just -- so, I mean, like, sometimes she just gets in her uppity moods.  And I think, you know what?  I -- I'm tired of being nice [LAUGH].  But I mean, I --
L:  You know, we all do.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, wh- -- it happens to everybody.  After a while, you know, depending on -- on the environment, and where you're at --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it -- it builds --
R:  Right.
L:  -- up.  And you have to let it out.
R:  Well, see, Burlingame's real uppity.  Burlingame's real --
L:  What was that?
R:  Burlingame's real yuppie.  And I'm like, far from yuppie.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You know.  I mean, not -- not so -- not so much it's yuppie, but just -- I mean, they go to the park here, with their kids in five hundred dollar outfits and manicures and pedicures, and won't get in the sand.  And I'm down there -- when I was a pre school teacher, rolling in the sand, making mud pies --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  You know, I live in -- in west LA, and it's like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- right next to, um, Brentwood and stuff --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and it's -- it's almost like that in certain places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that just, ah, totally gets on my nerves, you know.  It's --
R:  Yeah, 'cause you know, it's like my one daughter [inaudible] "Why are you pretending to be something your not?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Don't pretend, just be -- you know, the other people -- you look stupider.  You just be who you are, be happy and be proud of who you are, what you are, and what you do, and don't do.  It's, you know, you gotta do that.  You gotta, you know --
L:  Totally.
R:  It's like I told you, you -- you pretend you're something you're not, and then you, you know, you meet someone like that, and their gonna like you for that person.  When you like, let down your guard, you're not that person.  She said, "Wow".  You gotta just be who you are, you know?
L:  Exactly.  And then you know what?  After a while then, you might even forget who you really are.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And --
R:  You gotta remember that.  That's true.
L:  Yeah, totally.  I totally agree with that.
R:  How old are you?  If you don't mind me asking.
L:  I'm twenty eight.  I'm gonna be --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- twenty nine on the twenty, no the thirty first of July.
R:  Oh.  Wow.  That's --
L:  Yeah, the twenty ninth is actually when I'm taking my real estate exam.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool.
L:  That's why I almost said twenty ninth.  'Cause that's -- that's like the big date for me.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  It's pretty tough, too.  Huh?
L:  Yeah.  Well, right now, everybody's doing it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  With like, the insurance rates -- I mean the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- interest rates, that they had of gone down so low, and --
R:  Right.
L:  I've -- I've, um, actually called the department and they're swarmed -- they're -- they're swamped, actually, with calls.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- it shot up from two thousand people a month to like eight thousand people a month.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, 'cause there's -- there're so many houses selling right now.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  Yeah, everything's for sale.  That's when everything goes for sale here in Burlingame, too.  Summer.  Summer sales.
L:  Yeah -- yeah, I know.  It gets to the point where it's like, ah, the houses are now overpriced.
R:  Real overpriced.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Overpriced.
L:  It's a great time to sell.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is.  I know, when I worked -- going back to Crawford -- well, it wasn't Crawford then, I don't think.  It was, um, something else.  I'd sit -- that's when I was like, fifteen.  I was a file clerk.  I'd sit there and just read these files, and be amazed at these -- these are people -- what happened to these people?  And I'd go like, "This guy only gets money if he loses a leg and a right arm.  What is this?  He doesn't get no money --"
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  "-- for just his left leg.  But he had to lose his -- what is it?"  And they'd say --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that sucks.
R:  -- " [inaudible], you're not supposed to read them, you're supposed to file 'em".  And I'd be in there for hours, just reading, and just like, amazed at these things that would happen to these poor people.  And, you know, the -- what do you mean, they have to lose both limbs?  That's not fair.  What is that?  You know? [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- it's really sad.  I mean, that they're -- the whole system --
