R:  Hi, this is Nicola.
L:  This is Laurie.
R:  Hi, Laurie.  How are you?
L:  Fine.  I ...
R:  So, the -- the topic is, um, current events?
L:  Current events.  [MN]
R:  And -- and where you get -- where you fi- -- I guess where you find your news from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whether you get it from the Internet or the newspaper.
L:  [NOISE] Mine would just be, uh, T.V.  [NOISE]
R:  From the T.V.?
L:  Yeah.  How long did she say you had to talk?
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Have you ever done one of these before?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  You need -- it -- you need -- we need to talk about, um, the current -- where you get your current events from -- that was the topic they gave us -- for ten minutes.
L:  Hmm.  All I do is watch T.V.  I don't -- I mean, I'm not really up on the current events.
R:  Do you watch the news?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Do you -- do you know about this study, the Fisher study?
L:  Yeah.  But I've never did one yet.
R:  Okay.  'Cause it's a linguistics study, they wanna hear about how people talk to each other and -- and interact.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  But it's just the topic.  I don't really -- I mean, like --
R:  Well, um ...
L:  -- what kinda current events?
R:  Well, no.  It -- it said how do you get your current events?  Do you talk to your friends about current events?  I mean, let's say ...  Which -- which part of the country are you in, Laurie?
L:  Uh, Missouri.
R:  Missouri.  So, I don't know what the hot news is in Missouri at the moment.  But here in Texas where I am --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there was a lady who, um, just stood trial for killing a man with her car.  She drove, um ...
L:  Oh, yeah, the one in the windshield?
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Okay.  I get ya.
R:  You know what I mean?  So, like that type of stuff.  How did you find out about that?  Were you talking about it with your friends?  Did you watch the news?
L:  I saw that on the T.V. too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then that little boy that's been missing around here.
R:  In Missouri?
L:  Yeah.  He's -- he's, uh -- he's like -- he's got, um, medical problems --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and they can't find him.
R:  Oh, no.  How old is he?
L:  Uh, nine.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's really small then.
L:  They, uh -- the mother's talking a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but the father's not talking at all.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, huh.
R:  It's so scary when that type of stuff happens, isn't it?
L:  I know.  It's sickening 'cause, I mean, I think of my kids and it's ...
R:  Yeah.  How old are your children?
L:  Um, twelve, nine and four.
R:  Well, so I bet you probably get some of your current events from your nine and twelve year old as well.  [LAUGH]  I bet they tell you a lot about what's going on in the world.
L:  Yeah.  When they're at school, but at home we pretty much -- we're pretty much homebodies.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But now -- are they on school vacation now?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, they're keeping me busy.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's good.  Now, is -- has summer fully hit up there in Missouri?
L:  Has what?
R:  Has summer hit?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We're getting a -- getting a pool to help, uh, get through it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How long are the kids off school for?
L:  Uh, 'til like the third week of August.
R:  Oh, right.  Here in Texas the kids go back to school at the beginning of August and it never really makes sense to me because it's so hot then.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and then they get them out 'cause it's too.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  It's just mad.  So, do you have access to the Internet?  Do you look on the Internet for anything?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I go on the Internet a lot, but it's usually just for like couponing stuff and, you know, freebie stuff and ...
R:  I've never -- I've never found any of those, um -- like, I see the little banners that come up saying click here for ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  But those ones you really wanna stay away from.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause those are like, um -- like a scam.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, you can find coupons and stuff -- and stuff you just use on an everyday basis?
L:  Oh, yeah.  You'd be surprised.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  My downstairs looks like a grocery store --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because I get so much stuff free and cheap.  [NOISE]
R:  You keep it all stockpiled?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How funny.  Do you do that through doing different studies or you just send away for stuff?
L:  Uh, a little bit of both.  That's -- actually that's how I found out about this, uh, one.  They had like a little -- it's not like one of those chitchat rooms, but it's like a little posting kind of board --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and if you find a good deal then, uh, you go on there and say something and share it with the rest of the people --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- and, uh, some girl had come on and talked about this thing and gave the number and everything.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know if she get- -- she gets a referral thing or what, but I'm sure she got a lotta people doing it.
R:  Oh, well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I -- I talked to somebody last week, um, about -- it was quite a difficult conversation actually.  It was about life partners.  That was a tough one.
L:  [MN]
R:  But I was talking to a seventy nine year old man in Minneapolis --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- and he had been married -- it was his second marriage -- and he had been married for forty five years.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, he had quite a bit to share.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I would think so.
R:  Absolutely.  That was good.  So but, yeah, you really don't know -- you never know what the topic's going to be.
L:  Yeah.  That's a hard -- that'd be a hard one for me though because, like I said, I'm pretty much a homebody and I try not to know what's going on.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's pathetic, but ...
R:  You work hard not to know current events, huh?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I'm like -- you turn the T.V. on and all you see is everybody getting killed and -- or like all these -- what's really weird lately is with the, uh, stars that have died.  They were talking about that on the radio today.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Like, uh, Buddy Hackett and, uh -- what's that lady's name? -- Audrey, uh, Hepburn.
R:  Catherine Hepburn.  Yeah.
L:  Catherine Hepburn.
R:  Yeah, over the weekend.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and, um, that senator guy.  It's like -- it just seems like all of a sudden ...
R:  John Furman.  Yeah.  But they were all pretty -- I -- I don't know who the first person was you said.  But wasn't Catherine Hepburn like ninety three or something?
L:  Yeah.  She was ninety six.
R:  Ninety six and ...
L:  The senator guy was a hundred.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  He's lived a pretty good life then I think.
L:  Yeah.  I'm sure he had no complaints.
R:  Yeah.  That's funny.
L:  And then, uh, I think -- I think Buddy Hackett was like seventy something.  [NOISE]  Oh, then I saw -- I saw a thing today they had that, uh -- Kennedy and his wife -- it's like talking about how their marriage is on the rocks.  It's like come on.  People are dead.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Leave him alone.
R:  Yeah.  Its like put things into perspective.  There's no point in going back about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, huh.  Well, I -- I have to say that -- now, I don't have children at home and I think that makes a big difference because when you've got kids --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you can kinda get depressed if you know too much about the news and too much about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what's going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I get the paper and I get the Internet news and we talk about politics a lot in our house.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  The most I see in the Internet is like when that first little -- I have A.O.L. --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and when you first sign on they have that thing that pops up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- telling ya little tidbits.
R:  To- today's headlines and news.
L:  Yeah.  So, you have older kids or ...?
R:  No.  I don't have any children at all.
L:  Oh.
R:  No.  I'm in a -- I'm in a child free zone at the moment, but ...
L:  That's a -- that's probably a totally different world.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I'm ...
L:  Nothing compared to mine.
R:  Not at all.  No.  I'm sure you remember what it was but, you know, with a -- with ...
L:  No.  Actually.
R:  You can't remember?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, me and my husband we were together for like eight years when we finally get married and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when we did get married boom!
R:  That was it, huh?
L:  Yeah.  There was no time alone because the first one came real fast.
R:  Wow!  Well, thank goodness you had those eight years dating beforehand, huh?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  To know what it's like to be child free.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, now, do your kids, um, especially your older ones, do they get involved at school in different politic things or world events in their classes?
L:  Not really.  I remember like when the nine eleven thing happened [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that was -- you know, they talked with the kids a lot about that at school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then when the, uh, war started they were talking to the kids about that too.
R:  How did that affect your kids?  Were they -- were they --
L:  Uh, they --
R:  -- concerned about that?
L:  -- they like, um -- we live like an hour from St Louis downtown --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, one of the kids had -- actually they both did -- they both had trips to take -- for a field trip downtown --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they had to cancel that because we were under alert.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  So, they ended up having to go somewhere right in town --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which was pretty boring for them because we have a small little town --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's really nothing to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they all went to the bowling alley.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that wasn't much of a field trip for them.
R:  No.  I guess -- did that -- did that kinda drill it home for them that you have to be care- cautious even though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the war is in another country --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that we still have to be cautious here at home?
L:  Plus my husband works downtown in the, uh -- the jail that they have.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  So, that was kinda weird too with him working right where they had the alert stuff at.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I bet he gets to see quite a lot of what goes on --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- if he works down there.
L:  Yeah.  He ...
R:  He probably comes home with all kinds of colorful stories?
L:  Yes, he does.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Some you don't wanna hear.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], probably most of them actually.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I don't know if you saw it or not.  They had, uh -- just recently they had a guy who had killed his --
