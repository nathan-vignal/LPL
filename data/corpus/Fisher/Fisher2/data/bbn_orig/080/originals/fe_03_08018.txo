L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, I'm Crystal.
R:  Hi, I'm Adam. [NOISE]
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  So, uh, what's the last movie you saw?
L:  Oh, as a matter of fact, I watched, uh, what is it here?  About Schmidt.
R:  About Schm- -- oh, that?  Oh, I don't remember who that was with.
L:  That's Jack Nicolson's latest.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Was that good?
L:  Yeah, it was pretty good.
R:  All right.  I didn't see that.
L:  He's always pretty good, though.
R:  It looked a little sappy, though.
L:  Uh, not too bad.
R:  No?
L:  It wasn't real drippy or anything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it wasn't like an action movie, though.
R:  Right, right.  So, you must have seen that in the theater?
L:  Uh, no, actually I rented it.
R:  Oh, I thought that was still in the theaters?
L:  U- uh, I think it came out just this weekend --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  -- I mean, it's a new release.
R:  [NOISE] So, you would prefer to have rented that than, uh --
L:  Uh, well, I like going to the movies too, but we just got a big screen TV and have a DVD player so, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's almost as nice as going to the movies.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK]
L:  So --
R:  I see.  That's interesting.
L:  What was the last movie you saw?
R:  Uh, I believe it was Matrix Reloaded.
L:  Oh, how was that?
R:  Um, it was pretty good, but definitely not nearly as good as the first one, in my opinion, the plot was --
L:  Oh, you didn't think so?
R:  -- the plot was a little weak compared to the first one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- and they didn't have the big surprise factor of when you find out what the matrix is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that kind of, uh, ruined the plot a bit, in my opinion.  They just couldn't live up to the -- the first one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it was still pretty good. [NOISE]
L:  I h- hear the effects are really good in it.
R:  Yeah, well, there were definitely some really cool scenes, like, fighting scenes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where, uh, they had, like, hundreds of agents fighting, uh, Keanu's character --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at the same time, so that was pretty impressive. [NOISE] So --
L:  Hm.  I'll have to check it out.  I haven't seen either one of them.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, you haven't seen the first one?
L:  Huh-uh.  I think I'm probably the only person who hasn't. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well, you have to go see that, then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can rent that on your new DVD player.
L:  Yeah, I will.  I'll check it out.
R:  [LAUGH] So, do you like going to the movies?
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  All right.
L:  I'm a big movie buff.
R:  I like going to the movies but it's kind of annoying sometimes when you have to deal with other people.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I was just gonna say, [SIGH] it seems like anymore you go to a movie, especially, like, on a Saturday night, you always end up with somebody right behind you or right next you who talks all through the movie --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or has a comment to make about every scene.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, I always get -- seem to get stuck between, uh, behind really tall people.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, like, I'm not even that short, like, I'm six feet tall.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there's always someone, like, seven feet tall, somehow --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- manages to sit in front of me and I can't see anything.  So --
L:  Yeah, that would be annoying.  Do you go, like, where they have stadium seating, where it's --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, there's not too much of that around here, but, yeah, when available.  That -- that, of course, eliminates the problem.
L:  Where are you at?
R:  Uh, Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  How about yourself?
L:  I'm here in Kansas.
R:  Oh.  Right, do you have a lot of stadium theaters there?
L:  Uh, yes, actually, quite a few.  Um, I live in a Kansas city suburb --
R:  All right.
L:  -- so it's a pretty good sized city.
R:  [LIPSMACK] All right.  So -- and but renting is nice but, uh, like a l- -- a lot of the places round here now, you can keep it for up to a week, which is nice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, I'm a- -- I'm always annoyed when you have to go back the next day and return it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, especially if the weather's bad.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You have to get up and go out and [inaudible] the car out and take the movie back.
R:  Yeah, so -- but, uh, what other movies have you seen recently?
L:  Uh, let me think.  Actually, I haven't been t- to a movie in a while.
R:  Hm.
L:  And I -- what was the last movie I went -- actually went to?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'd have to think about it.  It's been a little while.
R:  How about TV movies?
L:  Uh, I don't watch a lot of TV, I usually just watch, like, PBS once in a while.
R:  Uh, [LIPSMACK] yeah, not too many movies on there. [NOISE]
L:  I don't have, like, HBO or anything like that.  Well, actually, out here we have, like, on Saturday night they have, like, an oldie.  They'll put on an oldie.  They had, like, last week they had The Thin Man.
R:  The what?
L:  The Thin Man.  Well, it's an -- a movie from the thirties.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it was -- a- actually, it was pretty good.  They're pretty good, they're a series.  And they're [SIGH] pretty cute actually.
R:  I never heard of that one.
L:  He's a detective and she's a high society girl that he's married.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  And he's --
R:  It's silent, or --
L:  Oh, no, no, no.
R:  It's from the thirties though?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't realize they [NOISE] -- I thought they were still in silent until then.
L:  It's black and white though.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  But they're al- -- he's always drinking, you know, like, back in the olden days they glamorized, you know, drinking and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  And he's always got a -- an icepack on his head [LAUGH] and things like that 'cause he's hungover.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he's [LAUGH] -- it's funny just to watch how things were, you know, back then.
R:  Right.
L:  How different things were.
R:  Yeah, that sounds pretty funny. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and how about you?  Do you watch a lot of movies on TV?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, I like to catch, like -- do you have cable?
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, you know, like [SIGH] -- like TNN is, or, uh, like, TNT?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you know what those networks are?
L:  Uh, I've heard of 'em.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh, they basically play, like, really -- well, just on, uh, Saturdays and Sundays, they play, like, really cheesy movies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I like to watch those sometimes.  Like, they'll play, like, kung fu movies and westerns --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things like that, so those are, like, I never remember -- you know, you don't wanna remember the name, but it's just a good way to kill, like, a Sunday afternoon.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So those are kind of, uh, fun things to watch.  So --
L:  What kind of movies do you like usually?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, usually action movies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the most part.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you can never go wrong with a kung fu movie --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  -- in my opinion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- especially if, uh, it's overdubbed.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The, uh, the English is overdubbed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That always makes it a little bit more interesting.
L:  Yeah, their mouths are moving one way and [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  -- the words are something else.
R:  So, gotta love the cheese factor of that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh --
L:  Did you see, uh, what is that?  Uh, Springing Tiger, Sleeping Dragon or s- --
R:  Yeah, now, that was a -- that was a quality movie though --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in my opinion.  Like, that was very well done.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Really good cinematography --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very good effects.  Did you see that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And did you think so?
L:  Yeah, I thought so.
R:  And, I mean, that even had an advanced, or fairly advanced, like, love theme to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, and w- -- that's not what I would call, like, a kung fu movie.  I would call --
L:  It's not you then, uh? [LAUGH]
R:  No, not -- not nearly cheesy enough.  I mean, like, really, really cheesy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Now, is, like, Bruce Lee considered kung fu, do you think?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] that'd be closer, but he's almost, like, too high quality.
L:  Oh, is he really? [LAUGH] 'Cause I think I've seen a Bruce Lee movie and they're all talking and --
R:  Oh, like Enter the Dragon?
L:  Uh, I'm not sure which one it was.  It might have been.  It's been a while ago.  But they're all talking, and the voices, you know, it seems like they use the same people on the s- -- in all the movies.
R:  Right.
L:  Their voices always sound the same. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's good stuff.  What kind of movies do you like?
L:  Uh, I like a good comedy.  Uh --
R:  What's your favorite one?
L:  Oh, actually, I rented, uh, Four Weddings and a Funeral last week.
R:  Yeah, that's pretty humorous.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's pretty good.
R:  What --
L:  And, oh, Best in Show is funny.
R:  Oh, yeah, that was hilar- -- did you see, uh, Waiting for Guffman?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Oh, you need to see that.
L:  I keep saying I'm going to pick it up and I haven't been able to find it yet.
R:  Yeah, that's hilarious.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's awesome.  And they have a new one out, uh --
L:  Yeah, I know they do, yeah.
R:  I really wanna see that. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something about the wind, something like --
L:  Oh, I can't think of what it's called, yeah.  Is it a -- has it been released?  It hasn't been released on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on DVD yet, though.
R:  No, it's in theaters right now, actually.
L:  It's still in theaters?
R:  So you'll have to go out, you know, can't see that on the TV.
L:  Yeah, I guess I will.  They are funny.
R:  Yeah, that's pretty good.
L:  Funny bunch.
R:  Can you, uh, so did you have a VCR before?
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  So, can you tell the quality difference?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Really?  'Cause I can't.  I have a DVD player. [NOISE] I don't know, pretty much the same to me.
L:  Oh, really?  I can see a big difference but, like I say, we got the big screen first and then we got the DVD and I think, you know, since it's a big screen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you can see, you know, the picture's larger, so you can see the quality a little more, so --
R:  Is it just a big screen, or is that HDTV?
L:  It's just a large screen.  It's just a Sony thirty two inch.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's not a huge screen.
R:  I see.
L:  But [SIGH] ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I wanna check out those HDTVs that you can hang on the wall.
L:  Oh, those ones.
R:  Have you seen those?
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  They cost, like, uh, twenty thousand dollars or something though.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh, they seem to be pretty interesting.
L:  But, you know, the price'll come down sooner --
R:  Yeah, eventually.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you can put it anywhere you want, and it doesn't take up any space.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, they are nice.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, uh, let's see, what other movies have you seen?
L:  Oh, jeeze.  Um ... those are the ones I've seen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- recently.  Let's see, The Thin Man and then --
