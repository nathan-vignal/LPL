L:  [NOISE]
R:  This is Chris.
L:  Hi, this is Arlene.
R:  Hi, Arlene.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  Okay.  You know, uh, just as an aside, I have been cutting these people off because we -- we're so bothered with people soliciting [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and they've gotten to the point where they will leave messages [LAUGH] on your machine, recorded messages, and I -- I just realized that.  Okay.  Let's go.
R:  Okay.  So, you -- do you still have time to do it now?
L:  Oh, uh, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I get most of my news from the T.V. I guess.
R:  Yeah.  I'm also a big T.V. news watcher.
L:  Right.  And the Net --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ...
R:  Are you like on a, um [LIPSMACK], uh, one of those pop ups, you know, from -- like, I get breaking news information from A.B.C. News dot com.
L:  No.
R:  No?  You go out in search of it, go to the -- like the C.N.N. website or something like that?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right.  Or the newspaper and then I belong to a chat group and they might bring something up and I'll go and check it out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, radio.  Lots of -- of mine is from the radio.
R:  Yeah.  Driving back and forth to work?
L:  No.  I'm retired and, uh, I listen to the radio until about --
R:  I see.
L:  -- ten o'clock in the morning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's on all night.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...
R:  I'll listen to it as I drive back and forth.  I'm still working.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um -- but I -- but I work about oh, thirty minutes, forty five minutes from where I live.  So, I do have a chance to -- to get some news in the morning and in the afternoon.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I really like the national evening news.  I make a point of watching that.
L:  Around six o'clock.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's here.
R:  Now, where are you located at?
L:  Uh, Illinois, Chicago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're in Kansas City.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yep.
L:  Eastern stakes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We got some good ones here.  I know that's right.  Have you been to Kansas City?
L:  No.  I have -- I have a -- a friend, a Net friend from there --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- about four years and, uh, we chat every day.  So, I ...
R:  And -- and they've talking up our stakes, huh?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Really everybody knows about the stakes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Good.  We will try to keep that secret, but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I know.  I know.  But everybody knows you're supposed to have a good need.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We sure do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Very fortunate.  But, um, yeah, I really like being able to go out and, uh, get on the Net and get news, you know, 'cause you can kinda get a different perspective from C.N.N. versus M.S.N.B.C. versus A.B.C. versus -- you know, they all have websites now and they have kinda just a little bit of a different take on what's going on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it seems like.
L:  I -- I -- in fact, when the phone rang I was just about to get up because I wanted to check something out that I heard on the radio this morning.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh, one of our veterans in -- in Iraq is in the hospital wounded and they're charging him eight dollars a day for food.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I heard that early this morning on the radio.  So, uh, it -- it wasn't in the paper today.  So, I was going to ...
R:  I think that's a real good point though and that's certainly something I use the Internet for is if I catch --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- just a snip --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of a conversation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then be able to go out and do some more checking on it.
L:  Right.  Or -- or, you know, you don't quite agree you -- you can again check it out, uh, get another viewpoint.  So, I -- I guess I use any -- any agenda I can to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to, uh, get the news.  I'm not against any.  I don't -- I don't have privy to tabloids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, in fact ... 
R:  Well, in that stuff you just never know how much they're ...
L:  That's what I mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's [LAUGH] --
R:  You never know.
L:  -- that's for entertainment purposes.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  I agree with ya there, Arlene.  I agree with ya there.
L:  I wouldn't trust it for a minute.  So ...
R:  And even the newspapers, you know, have -- have a certain slant.
L:  Their own agenda.
R:  Yeah.  They do.
L:  Mhm.  We -- we've had an incident here of, uh -- I guess you've probably read of it -- the porches that fell down.  In the begin- -- in ...
R:  Yes.  I did so.  What a tragedy.
L:  Well, it is.  Uh, in the beginning it was, um -- well, everybody was saying that whatever happened it was a number of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that the work had been done on the building and [several inaudible words].  Well, by today they switched it back to the -- the owner.
R:  Wow!
L:  Mhm.
R:  That they had -- and I had heard something about that today --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that, um, they hadn't gotten permits or something like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when they built 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow!
L:  Mhm.  At first they -- they had permits, but they could not find the ones for the porch --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- porches and I guess it -- like, today it -- the whole thing is dumped on him --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- which, um, I don't know.
R:  Well, I heard like forty people were on each of those porches.
L:  Well, we've been hearing more.
R:  More than that?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they didn't look that -- well, I guess -- did they go along the whole backside of the -- of the apartment?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  Three floors.
R:  Jeeze.
L:  And people were on two of 'em, okay?  And even -- all right -- the -- the -- the place was redone completely years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which means it -- it still may be good, but that's a lotta people --
R:  Boy, you're not kidding.
L:  -- and if you consider that they're young people that live in that building that's been going on for a long time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's been going on -- you know, it's not as if the building just went up and this happened.
R:  Right.  And I'm sure you're probably hearing about that through the radio and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- through the T.V. and through the newspaper and on the Internet and ...
L:  R- right.  Right.  You -- you -- it's, um -- I don't know.  It's a terrible thing.  We lost another one today.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, gosh!
L:  Yeah.
R:  There was a young man from Kansas City that was included.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  A twenty two year old named John Jackson.
L:  Did you know him?
R:  I did not.  I did not.  But, uh, um, it was pretty quick after, um -- after the -- after that had happened that his name was broadcast on, uh, our local news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as being from Kansas City, graduated from a local high school and his family still lives here.  So ...  [LIPSMACK]
L:  It's really a -- a great loss.  It -- you know, the people were just ready to start life and [COUGH] -- well, start contributing.
R:  You bet.
L:  You know?  It wasn't as if it were -- were a bunch of addicts [LAUGH] with strange things ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, these were to be contributors to society.  But I forgot what we were talking about.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, indeed.  Yes, indeed.
L:  People can talk about anything.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But ...
R:  [MN]
L:  Okay.  What were we talking about?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, how do people get their news?
L:  Oh, we were distributing news then.  We get it from each other.
R:  And also true, also very true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yep.  How do we find out about current events?  And certainly having access to a person that's right there in Chicago I'm probably getting better information from you than I did --
L:  Than you would ...
R:  -- from the Internet or from the local newspapers or from the radio.
L:  Right.  Because I know we hear about it off everything you do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause it's on every, uh, newscast and if they find another nail they cut in --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- you know?  So, yeah, people -- people are good news spreaders.  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  That's true.  And -- you know, and -- and part of that of course is how -- how their -- like, how their ears are, you know, what part of the story did they hear of course, you know?  Everybody kinda brings their own filters --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to the conversation.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, you know, I -- I have the radio or T.V. on all day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I find I kind of use it as a background.  It's not always up there in front of me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I -- I'm picking up stuff, you know, and -- and -- and then I'll stop and listen, but I've lost part of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's when I start to do my little investigating.
R:  Mhm, on those things that interest ya?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  'Cause if I listen to all of it all day, uh [LAUGH], I wouldn't be doing anything else.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I could relate.  I can relate.  And of course, you know, then there's the issue of whether or not you're looking for local news or national news or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- international news and -- and where you go, uh, to find out about those things.  I know that I have a friend in Switzerland and there was a train wreck in Switzerland.  Oh, this has been a couple of years ago.  And I was --
