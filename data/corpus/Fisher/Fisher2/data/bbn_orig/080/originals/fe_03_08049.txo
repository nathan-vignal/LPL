L:  [NOISE].
R:  Kelly.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, Hi.
R:  Hey.
L:  I didn't know how this worked.
R:  Me either.  This is my first time.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about video games, or computer games.  But --
L:  Oh, and that's it?
R:  Ah, yup.  I think so.  But it says for eight minutes.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  Well --
R:  Do you play games online?
L:  I don't, online.
R:  Or you play like, CD?
L:  I play console games, is what I play.
R:  You play --
L:  Like Nintendo and stuff like that.
R:  Oh.  So what type of games?
L:  Yourself?  [NOISE] Do you play any?
R:  I play -- I don't play console games.  I play computer games, online, and then, um, on CD, like Age of Empires, or Dominoes.  Stuff like that I'll play online.  So --
L:  Oh, okay.  How do you like Age of Empires?
R:  Um, I like it, except when I play online, I'm not that good, so they beat me really bad.  Yeah.
L:  Don't you hate that?
R:  They team up.  And it's [LAUGH] -- it's really --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- frustrating.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  You get skunked.  It's like, I don't want to play with you guys any more.  Have you played Age of Empires?
L:  Yup.  I have.  I played Age of Empires, and then -- sort of along the lines Starqu- -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  Starcraft, I play a lot.
R:  I never heard of that one.
L:  But, um, that was, you know -- I felt like I was beaten -- getting beaten --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- all the time by twelve year olds who just play all day.
R:  And who team up.
L:  You know, I got a life --
R:  Yeah, they team up and they --
L:  I got a family, I got a job.
R:  -- stump you.  And they think it's fun.  It's not fun.
L:  Yeah, and I'm getting killed, so [LAUGH] --
R:  So, I like, used to play a game on the internet --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- that was called Federation.  It was a text based game, though.  It didn't have pictures, or anything.  It was all typing.
L:  Oh.
R:  And that -- it was different.  I played that --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- for about six years.  I was really addicted to that game.
L:  You've been around --
R:  A little bit.
L:  -- the gaming community.
R:  I guess more than I really thought I had.
L:  I mean, ah --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Six years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on one game.  That's pretty good.
R:  I had to quit, though.  I quit like -- people get addicted to cigarettes, and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got addicted to that game.  So, I had to quit, cold turkey.
L:  Ah.
R:  Ah, haven't played that one.
L:  Along the lines of Everquest.  Ah, I have a brother in law that was addicted to --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that one.  I mean, he played four hours a day.  Yeah.  And have a --
R:  Oh, that's -- yup.
L:  -- family, and work, and --
R:  That's me.
L:  You know, he'd be up 'til two in the morning.
R:  Sometimes -- I mean, even on my days off, I'd -- I'd have to set my alarm --
L:  So it's like --
R:  -- like, you know, thirty minutes before my husband woke up to go to work, so that I could make sure I was in bed, but when he got up.  So that he wouldn't know I'd been up all night, playing [LAUGH] that stupid game.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Huh.  So, it was very -- it was pretty cool.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, yup.  Had to quit.  Now --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah?
R:  I settle for -- ah, Ages of Empire, I haven't played in a while.  Um, my husband likes the G- Ghost Recon --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all that kinda stuff.  But that's, ah, that's too, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Too much hand eye coordination, all at the same time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I used to play Duke Nukem.  I like that game.
L:  Yeah, a very detailed game, I think that is.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I'm waiting for the new one, someday, maybe.
R:  So you're just a console -- console type guy?
L:  Hasn't happened yet, so -- but I agree, there's some good games out there.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yes.  I'm more like -- like X Box and Nintendo are the two I'm playing right now.  I really like 'em, 'cause I don't have to worry about having the newest computer, or, you know, the latest video card.  I can just go and --
R:  Oh.  Yeah, it's just not the same.
L:  -- I know it's gonna work and I don't have to worry about drivers and any of that stuff.
R:  I play cards a little bit on the computer.  My husband travels, so we'll play each other --
L:  So, that --
R:  Like last night, we stayed up til probably one o'clock, playing dominoes and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- backgammon online against each other, so -- yeah, that's pretty cool.  Um, yeah --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- ah, actually we've been at Yahoo, lately.
L:  Yeah, that would -- do you go to like the zone --
R:  So, yeah --
L:  -- or where do you play?
R:  -- I've been to the z- -- you know, I've played at the zone, before.  Either one.  Which ever.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Which ever you just go in to.  Um, it's pretty fun.  I guess [NOISE], yeah, since we have to be apart, we --
L:  Right.
R:  -- make the best of it.  So --
L:  Well, that's not a bad way to do it.
R:  He -- he beats me a lot, so, though.  That's -- sometimes he lets me win, I know, that makes me mad.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Just beat me, baby.  I'll learn.
L:  Huh, well that's --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, yeah, that's --
R:  Yeah.  And like you said, most of the time it's like, um, ten or twelve year olds that --
L:  I don't know.  That's the thing with online, is I always feel that I'm not as good as the guy on the other end.
R:  That, you know, they get off school, and they play all day, and --
L:  And some --
R:  -- we get on there, and we're just target practice for 'em.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Exactly.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Somehow they need to weed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- those out for, I think, online to really become --
R:  I guess it's kinda why I've kinda drifted to --
L:  -- something that I would play more than I would play a game by myself at home.
R:  -- you know, like -- like Canasta, ah, stuff like that.  'Cause that --
L:  I just don't like it the other way.
R:  I -- I play those, 'cause really the younger ones don't have concept of a complicated card game yet.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  They can shoot me up all they want, but [NOISE] a complicated card game --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- they're not -- and dominoes.  I don't know many -- too many young kids that like dominoes.
L:  That's true.
R:  So --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  That's true, you are limiting your age group.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Hey [NOISE].
R:  Wanting to know who you're talking to.
L:  I'll c- -- talk to you in a minute.
R:  Huh.
L:  Come and get my phone [NOISE].
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- 
R:  Yeah, this is pretty cool.  I -- I --
L:  Yeah, that's my wife.  She's like, "What's going on?" 
R:  -- ran across it last night.
L:  She's trying to win something on the radio right now.
R:  This phone thing, yeah.
L:  So [NOISE] -- it's in the bedroom [NOISE].
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, this -- this survey thing?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Well, that's -- my wife signed up and I answered and I knew she was downstairs, working, so I thought, "Oh, I'll just -- you know, computer games.  I can do that one".
R:  Well, you know, they're looking for men to sign up.  They pay you like, a dollar if -- if you can get a guy to sign up, and they'll pay you like, five dollars if you can get ten guys to sign up.
L:  So, anyway.
R:  So there's a shortage of guys signing up for this, I guess.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  Ah, if she's like me, I sign my husband up for everything.  He doesn't know.
L:  Hm.  I'll have to --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know if my wife [NOISE] signed me up or not.  I'll have to check into it.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, it doesn't ask for the name, I don't guess.
L:  Well that's -- I -- I assume I'm signed up.  So, [LAUGH] maybe this --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- was for me.  I don't know.  But it doesn't say --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- anything.  It just says this is about a v- -- computer game.  So --
R:  So, do you play Zelda?
L:  I was like, "Huh, that's interesting, and I thought they would ask me questions and I would like, press one for this, or --"
R:  I used to love that game.
L:  -- two for this, but that's not what happened.  So -- I am actually right now --
R:  Really?
L:  -- playing Zelda.
R:  Yeah, I haven't had a Nintendo in a very long time.
L:  Yeah, I really -- this new one -- I'm about twenty hours into it, and I think I'm half way there.
R:  Um, I have it on Playstation.  But I saw it was coming out, or they -- maybe they just came out with a new Zelda.  I was like, "I want a Nintendo".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, it's very good.  It plays like it's -- it looks like a cartoon.
R:  They should make it -- I wonder why they don't come out with online yet.  They're --
L:  And, um, what they've done is really -- it's really well done.  I'm impressed.
R:  Oh.
L:  I [NOISE] really enjoy it.
R:  Hm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't know.  Nintendo's not -- 'cause there's no money in Nintendo sets.  Is what I read.
R:  Hm, well.  If people are addic- -- if people are -- if people really like it, they'll pay.
L:  So they're saying, you know, online -- why go to invest it all, because [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.  I -- I -- I paid to play the game for six years.
L:  -- well, how are we gonna make our money back yet?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] And that's true.  That's true, so [NOISE] -- mhm.  Yeah, no that's true.
R:  Have you ever played the Sims?  Have you tried that game?
L:  So -- but -- it is.  In these others, the story's really good, and -- and, ah, I'll be interested to see how Nintendo does, just like, you know, over the next little while.
R:  I tried it, and I'll probably try it again.  I really haven't, um --
L:  The -- I haven't.
R:  I guess I -- I haven't caught onto it.
L:  I have some friends that have that say the Sims is -- you know, it's addicting like some of those others.
R:  They're -- they're very temperamental, and I keep -- I keep killing myself in there.  Starving myself, or -- they have this little one and nobody else has seen it, but they have this clown that keeps coming in and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- beating me up.  So, I don't know what I'm doing.  'Cause everybody says, "I've never seen a clown in there".  And I keep -- everytime I start a new character, this clown comes in and beats me up.  So, I don't know what I'm doing to draw the clown out.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But, I quit.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  And he came out like, six times.  I quit.  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That's right.  It -- this isn't fun anymore [NOISE].
L:  [NOISE].
R:  So -- 
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I don't -- I don't know either.  I, ah --
L:  You were [inaudible] [LAUGH].  I'm tired of getting killed.  I'm tired of getting beat up.  Right.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Huh.  That's surprising.  I don't know what that would be [NOISE].  But, yeah, the Sims is -- that's an online game that [NOISE] -- and see, that's coming out for the consoles, and I've thought, "Well, maybe".  [NOISE] I'll pick it up for, you know, it's on the X Box --
