L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Diana.
L:  My name's Jessie.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm, um, in California.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Dallas over here.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, have you seen any good movies lately?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  What have you seen?
L:  The last, um, new release that I saw at the movie theater was The Matrix.
R:  Okay.
L:  I watched The Matrix and X Men.  I think I watched X -- Matrix after though --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- and then I ha- -- I saw Daredevil at the dollar theater, like recent- -- that was my most recent but it was at the dollar theater and I had seen it once before that so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it was the second time, and I do enjoy going to the movies and I do enjoy renting movies.  Um, I'm not sure if I like one over the other --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I guess if anything I do rather watch them at home because I like being in the comfort of my own home.
R:  Mhm, yeah, definitely.
L:  Um, but, I don't know, I -- I like to go watch movies occasionally at theaters but it's not like a big deal to me.
R:  Yeah, same for me.  Like I don't have a ton of money 'cause I'm a college student so --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- it's definitely -- like if I go see a movie I can rent a mo- -- I rent a movie 'cause here it's about eight fifty to go see a movie --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's just too expensive.  I can rent two or three movies for that price and I'd rather stay at home so I can just like --
L:  How much are the Blockbuster movie over there?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  How much are the Blockbuster movie?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, we don't have a -- well, there is a Blockbuster.  The place that I rent from though, most new releases are three fifty --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and then they let you keep it -- you couldn't -- you -- it's not due, I think you have it for two nights, ah --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I -- it's a little, like, family rental place, which is really nice.
L:  I see.
R:  So, yeah.  I don't know, I -- ju- just 'cause of money issues, it's so much easier for me just to r- -- or cheaper for me to rent --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and do that sort of thing than go to the movies.  But, yeah, I saw The Matrix and I really liked that, but not the second one so --
L:  So, you went to the theater to see it?
R:  Um, actually, I didn't.  My boyfriend downloaded it on the internet.
L:  [LAUGH] I see, um.
R:  [LAUGH] I know what you mean.  Yeah, maybe I shouldn't say that if they're recording us.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But yeah, so we -- like we -- we did that a lot 'cause he -- through our college, um -- 'cause in Vale you get internet through the dorms, you are --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- able to, um -- there's a certain network where you ca- -- would download just from people in the area so you could --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- download a movie in about an hour --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so I watched it that way.  It wasn't super good quality but it was still good stuff.
L:  You get the whole picture.
R:  Yeah, you do.  So, yeah, it was pretty cool, so.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  It's just -- generally just cheaper if I don't do -- usually don't do that very often but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- renting is just, ah -- just cheaper overall and I can still get stuff done around the house that I want to like, you know, do laundry or something like that while I'm watching a movie or something like that, I can do that so.
L:  That's cool.  Yes --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, I don't know why they don't give us more to talk about in ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, um, so what did you think of Matrix though.
L:  Um, I liked it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think I liked it better than X Men.
R:  Oh, really?  I haven't --
L:  Um.
R:  -- seen X Men movie yet so.
L:  Yeah, I think I liked Matrix better, but I -- I mean, of course, like they could of -- I think they could of cut down the -- like the fight scenes are so long, like it's --
R:  Mhm, they're --
L:  -- fine that they had 'em but they -- they dragged 'em out for a bit too long sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Um, have you seen any of the Animatrix stuff?
L:  Any of the what?
R:  Animatrix.
L:  No, I don't think --
R:  You heard of that?
L:  No, I don't think I have.
R:  What it is, is they have, um -- they're little short movies about the matrix --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think there's about twelve of them and they come on a DVD that they're selling, and that just talks more about the matrix and just different -- completely different characters most of the time, but it's really cool 'cause you learn a little bit more about the matrix.  Like one of them is an animated pr- -- thing that has -- is like talking about how the, um -- the war between the humans and the machines started.  So, that was really cool 'cause it offered you some more, ah, background information on it.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  So, yeah.  It was --
L:  Where do you get that?
R:  Um, they have them at Costco --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- for, like, fifteen bucks.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  And it's pretty -- it's really cool 'cause it's got just back- -- more background information about it and you learn more about what the matrix is and how it developed and stuff so.
L:  But the matrix is not really a real thing is it?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.  So, they're basically just giving background, ah, for the movie. 
R:  Ah, yeah.  They're ki- -- they're -- it's -- they're like miniature movies in and of themselves just talking about how the matrix was developed.  Like the a- -- it's like -- like you're in the actual world, that goes through and talks about, you know, it's like a little animated thing about how the machines rose up and then they were -- they were fighting back the forces.  They're like little miniature -- like ten minute movies in themselves.
L:  I see, that's interesting.  I have never heard of that.
R:  So, it's really -- it's really cool.  Yeah, it's got all -- it --
L:  And it's called Animatrix?
R:  Yeah, it's called Animatrix.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's really cool 'cause it just kind of offers you more and you're trying to -- you know, figuring out more about how things were developed and, yeah.
L:  Wow, that is interesting.  I've never heard of that.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- they're pretty cool.  It's helped me a lot because I totally did not get the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- movie the first time and I had to --
L:  Well, yeah.  When I went to watch the second one, like I have a really bad memory so --
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  -- whenever I went in I had -- the people I was with, they had to make sure I knew what was going on in the first one.  I even asked, "What's the Matrix again?" 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, even the movie that, like the title, I'm like, okay, w- -- I kn- -- I knew what it was about and stuff but I was like, "What does that whole thing mean though again?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just because I forgot completely.  It's probably better if I had watched the first one at -- like, on video and then went to the theater to watch the second one so I'd have a better idea.
R:  Yeah, 'cause that -- that's what I ended up doing.  Like my boyfriend had the, um, DVD so I watched it with him and so I could pause it and be like, "Okay, well what the heck is going on?"
L:  Yeah, I do --
R:  So it --
L:  -- much better if I like watch the older one right before I'm goi- going to watch the new one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- otherwise I'm totally lost again.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's really -- it was real -- an interesting movie, very interesting progress that I'm looking forward to seeing the next one which is the -- come out in just six months, so that's really cool.
L:  Yeah, ah --
R:  So.
L:  -- they really did leave us hanging this time so.
R:  Um, yeah, I was really concerned.  It seems like -- like, what is it?  Zion's another matrix.  It's not even real or something, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was kind of -- I don't know.  Yeah, it was a little bit of a cliffhanger.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  But, yeah, that's really cool, and then also the have the video game for it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's on Playstation Two, which is really cool 'cause you're -- it's kind of, ah, they say it follows a similar plot line to the second movie, but you are, um, playing as Niobe, which is, ah, Jada Pinkett Smith's character --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so that was really interesting, 'cause like you just like got to learn more about the matrix and different things about it, so that was really cool.
L:  I see.
R:  So, yeah, it's pretty neat oh but --
L:  Interesting.
R:  Yeah.  And that -- you said that you liked the, ah, X Men movie?
L:  Um, I don't -- I didn't like it so much because I totally forgot what happened in the first one and I never --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- got a chance to ask anybody -- like I didn't even think before the preview -- during the previews, to ask people, "Oh, what is that first one about?"  So, I watched --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the second one totally lost and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it just kind of bore me a little bit but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, I mean, of course there are scenes in it that were still good or whatever, but I was kind of lost even from the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- beginning to the end I was a little bit lost.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I even forgot what's, like, ea- -- the people's names like, and their like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what they -- what powers they had.  Like what --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- super human powers they had or whatever, I just completely forgot --
R:  Yeah, 'cause I saw the -- I --
L:  -- and so I was confused.
R:  Yeah.  I saw the first one in the theater and was really surprised that I liked it 'cause I never, you know --
L:  Well, see -- yeah.
R:  -- did any X Men stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, but, see the funny thing is, like when I was little, growing up, I used to watch the cartoons.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, but of course my memory doesn't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- help me, so I like totally f- -- I mean, here and there I remember, like, ah, like the big names, like Wolverine and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, Baton Rouge or whatever, Rouw[?], whatever her name is --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- and stuff, yeah, but I don't remember it, like I couldn't remember what all their powers were or what they could or couldn't do and -- just the whole thing.  I mean, it was -- it wasn't bad though, I mean I still -- I mean, it was -- I'm sure it was -- still was a lot better than I'm playing it out to be.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Well, I was really surprised that I liked it 'cause I -- I didn't -- I never watched the show or knew anything about the characters and I really liked it so I -- I'm -- hopefully when the -- when it comes out on video I'm gonna rent it 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just like it.  I was very surprised, I didn't think I'd like that kind of movie and it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really interesting.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  There was a few kind of, you know, different people and the futuristic kind of thing.
L:  Well, what about like Lord Of The Rings, do you like all that?
R:  I cannot follow that.  I've never read any of the books, so I don't really know the characters.  I've tried to watch it, 'cause my boyfriend has the whole thing on DVD --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I just can- -- he -- even with him trying to explain it, I'm like, "Who is that?  What is that person doing?" and I've never been able to follow that.  I need to try to read the book and then watch it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I am a pretty avid book reader, so if I think if I read the books I could probably figure it out.  But, yeah, that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- totally went, like, [MN] flying right by me.
L:  So -- so then do you read and watch Harry Potter then?
R:  Yes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Harry Potter, I haven't gotten my hands on the, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what is it, fifth book, fourth book?
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm not a big --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- reader so I'd rather go watch them in the theaters and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I --
L:  -- and see what the big hype is about, even though everyone always says the book's always better.
R:  Yeah, I real- -- I'm really like the books.  I read all the books last summer.  It took me like two weeks to read like all of them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they're really -- they're fun because, you know, it's a l- -- lower reading level so it's more just a fun read --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so it's really nice for me to get away from my text books and stuff, if I sat and read something actually fun but, yeah, I've a friend who's finishing it up and is then gonna let me borrow the Harry Potter book, so, I think eight hundred pages though which --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- will be interesting but, yeah, it -- I [inaudible] the movies are really cute.  I really enjoyed the movies, and I was happy --
L:  Yeah, I saw the first one.  I never saw the second one yet, but I saw the first movie they made.
R:  Yeah, I was really happy 'cause they did stay, um, pretty true to the story line --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and even some of the lines directly from the book, so I was really happy that -- ah, I think the author was fairly involved in the -- the script writing and --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- everything like that, so it stayed pretty true to her vision, and that was a really cool part, especially for people who've read the book, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and so, yeah, I'm -- I'm looking forward to see what they end up doing --
