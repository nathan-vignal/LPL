R:  Hi, my name's Ron.
L:  Hi, my name is Jenny. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, hey, Jenny.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  So, uh, this is actually my first call that's actually been successful.  The other times they either dropped out or I just wasn't home, so --
L:  Okay, this is my second and I haven't done one in over two months, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, my phone rings at, like, five o'clock every day and I'll, you now, a lot of times I'm just not there or I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- didn't hear it, but today I did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you like computer games, do you?
L:  Um, [SIGH] yeah, sometimes.  I'm not, like, big time into 'em but, um, yeah, I -- I play some.  What about you?
R:  Yeah, I like to play.  Uh, I play Scrabble which -- online, which, I mean, it's a computer game, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm not sure w- -- exactly what they mean, if they mean, like, [inaudible] and stuff but ...
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't play any, like, figure action hero games [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I play, like, Solitaire is, like, my favorite and then, like, Tetris too, so [NOISE] ...
R:  Oh, yeah, I li- -- what do you like about, uh, Solitaire?
L:  I don't know, [NOISE] I think I just get addicted. [LAUGH] 'Cause I do the Vegas style --
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- so, um, you know, I'll -- usually I lose money and I'm, like, "Oh, I -- I'm a hundred dollars in the hole, I can't stop until, you know, I'm at least ahead by something" so I keep playing over and over and over and over again, finally I end up winning and then I stop. [LAUGH] [NOISE] So --
R:  I don't know what Vegas style --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, I guess you're betting that -- is that -- is that, like, a regular Microsoft Solitaire or is it something that --
L:  Yeah, it's the one that comes with the computer [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but you can make it so that, um, that [NOISE] you use money.  I mean, it's not real, like, money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like the casinos online and stuff [NOISE] but it's -- it's fake.  So --
R:  Well, that's not too bad.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] so when you're playing, uh, Solitaire, are you just, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just because you're bored or -- or --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- or is it something you like -- really like [LAUGH] --
L:  Just because I'm bored, so I'll usually -- like, to pass the time, I'll just hop on [NOISE] and play, so --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- I don't know.  Do you just play Scrabble 'cause you're bored too, or just 'cause you're --
R:  Oh no, I love --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I love to play Scrabble, I play it all the time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so it's, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a real good, uh, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- way to spend my time, I guess.  Uh, like, even right now I'm, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm watching a -- a game, and it's kind of nice.  I mean, it's a good way to, like, build --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your vocabulary and, uh, and you kinda meet people that, you know, you don't -- you don't really meet 'em but, you know, you know who they are, so it's, uh, it's kind of way to have, like, virtual friends and stuff.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I've never played anything online before, but I didn't know, [NOISE] um --
R:  Oh, yeah, it's not too -- but there's a place in -- it's actually in Romania, and we connect to this place in Romania and they have, like, uh, four or five hundred people play [SIGH] at one time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, you know, not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not all in one big game but, you know, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I like to also play -- I'll, like, play chess online and that's pretty good, 'cause you might get, you know, or cards.  There's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you go to, like, Yahoo, uh, games dot yahoo dot com --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and there'll be -- there'll be, like, five thousand people playing cards at one time.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just an --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- amazing amount of, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they also -- I think they have Solitaire on Yahoo, so, I mean, they must --
L:  Is that free or do you have to pay for it?
R:  Uh, it's free.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, so, I mean, there might be something that you might -- you might consider checking out 'cause, like I said, you can, uh, they have it at all different levels, so, uh, you know, so whatever level you're comfortable playing at and you can, uh, [MN] you know, you can probably, like, find somebody, f- -- you know, in your area or somebody, you know, with your same kind of interests to play.  And it might be a little better than -- than playing Solitaire.  I like Solitaire, but it's just [NOISE] -- I can't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I hardly ever win at it, so it's, like, really, you know, really tough.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, well, I --
R:  But --
L:  -- I got good at it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'd be that bored, so [LAUGH] --
R:  No, well, I like -- the best thing about -- about the Microsoft Solitaire game is when you win --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the cards bounce on the screen.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And it gets, you, like, all psyched up for the next game and you can't stop.
R:  Yeah, you're, like, "Yay".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I know some people that, um, with video games, they're just on the computer all the time, that's all they do, is just buy new ones. [NOISE] They're, like, the three D, you know, or four D, like when they go into buildings and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I don't get that -- that into the, you know, the shoot 'em up games, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're interesting to watch, but ... I'm, you know, I'm -- I'm, like, forty, so it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm -- I've slowed down a little bit, I just don't have the hand eye coordination that I used to when I was a kid, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for me to sit there and just blast things for, you know, for hours on end --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just really doesn't do much for me, you know, so --
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  Yeah, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Um, um --
R:  Do you ev- --
L:  Huh? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I didn't know if I was cutting you off or something.
R:  No, no.  You're okay.  Uh, my cellphone cuts off sometimes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's just really hard to think of something to talk to a total stranger about for ten minutes.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Even if it's, like, okey dokey.  Do you ever play, like, Minesweeper?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, is that the one where, um, the bombs are hidden?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I play that.
R:  Yeah, that one's pretty good.  It's frustrating.  I had a friend who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could, like, just go right through that really quickly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I can do it sometimes, but not very often.  Only the simpler games.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's kind of stressful too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause you're, like, "Ah, ah, ah, ah" you know, boom.
L:  Yeah, 'cause there's no real way to, like, you know, be in control kind -- I mean, they have the numbers, but what do those number -- little numbers mean?  I mean, it could be any --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- direction, so it's more like it's --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- skill or more chance.
R:  "-- it's, like, w- -- yeah, you know, it's, like, "Okay, I'm touching this many bombs and oh no, the bomb went off" and it's, like, "Yeah".
L:  And then you gotta start all over again.
R:  And then you gotta start again, yeah.  So, it's kind of a pain that way.   I like that.  You ever play, like, uh, what else is there?  The Solitaire --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is pretty good.  Do you -- do you change the, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the decks when you're -- when you're playing Solitaire?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you change, like, the -- the, uh --
L:  Yeah, sometimes.
R:  -- the packs of cards?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, like -- it's, like, the robots or the fishes and stuff?
L:  [NOISE] There's the one, um, with the palm trees.  If you keep it on, like the sun actually gets a face and it, like, smiles and stuff and then it up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and goes away.  And it -- the sun stays there, but a face comes out and it -- I don't know, [NOISE] it's weird. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, there's supposed to be s- -- I heard there was one of those that you can cheat on, because the, uh, it's, like, you look up on the r- -- if you put in, like, the right combination or something, every time it's, like, a good card or something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it'll s- -- kind of smile.  Maybe it's Minesweeper.  I think it's Minesweeper that, if you put in, like, the right combination --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, if you go over the, you know, the bomb it'll smile or not smile at you.
L:  Oh.
R:  Something like that.  I'm not sure, I'd have to look.  That was a long time ago.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause it's -- I don't --
L:  The fact it was [NOISE] --
R:  -- play that often.
L:  -- [NOISE] missed out.
R:  It's -- it always -- it's always funny, though, when it, you know, if you go into, like, a government office or something and somebody's playing Solitaire.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That always -- that gets real mad.  I'm, like, "No, stop playing video games on my time" you know?
L:  Yeah, 'cause if you play on your own, like with a deck of cards, it takes forever.  So --
R:  Oh, yeah, and then it's --
L:  -- it's so much more convenient on the computer. [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, and plus the computer keeps the score and, like I said, I love the bouncing cards at the end if you win, that's --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause I would, like, just, you know, almost finish it up and then just leave it there --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and then play the final card, just to get the stupid thing to bounce or, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's so hard.  So, what do you think they're doing when they tape these things?  What are these phone calls for?  I have no idea.
L:  I don't know either.  I have [NOISE] -- they -- I think they're trying to find out how people, like, haven't -- that have never talked to each other, how they relate to each other when they talk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think it's more, like, just the whole thing that we don't know each other, that's what they're trying to figure out.
R:  Maybe they're doing it to, like, figure out how to use voice -- I thought it was, like, voice recognition or something, you know, like if they had the software that, you know, the first time you'd ever spoke to a computer over the phone and they needed to figure out, you know, what you, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what you sounded like or something.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I don't know either.  How did you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- find out about this?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I saw an ad in the, um, newspaper.  How about you?
L:  Oh, okay.  I found out about it online.  It's, like, I'm in a membership of money and, um, money and shopping.
R:  Oh, there we go.
L:  Just like the mystery shopping stuff.
R:  Oh, those are scams a lot of times.
L:  Huh?
R:  Some of those mystery shopping things are scams.
L:  Well, yeah, I think some of 'em are, but I found a good one.  I thought it was a scam but I'm, like, "I'm just gonna trust it" and it actually was real.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  [NOISE] So, --
R:  Yeah, 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- some of 'em, you know, they'll, like, say, you know, "Be a mystery shopper --"
L:  [NOISE]
R: "-- but join our network first for twenty nine ninety nine and then, you know, we'll send you this list of mystery shopper places" it's, like, "Okay".
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can do it online, it's, you know, or, um, without doing that.  It's kind of tricky how to -- I don't know you'd find out without -- 'cause the place I went through, they find different, um, places that do it, that are marketing places and they let you know which ones and then they send you ones that are in your area and you can apply for them or not, so --
R:  Yeah, I used -- I used to do, like, focus groups in San Francisco every once in a while --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- and that was pretty nice 'cause they'd send --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you -- you go -- you go there and they pay you, like, uh, sixty bucks or something to sit there and, like, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we were, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- tasting, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- barbecue sauce or something after --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- always kinda interesting.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Have you got about a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about a two year old there?
L:  Huh? [NOISE]
R:  Do you have a two y- --
