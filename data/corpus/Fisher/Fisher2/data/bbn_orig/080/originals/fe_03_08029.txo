L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, can you hear me?
R:  Yes.

R:  Ah, I'm Akeesha[?].
L:  How -- how are you doing?
R:  I'm pretty good.  How are you?
L:  I'm good, thanks.
R:  Okay, there, um, it's like [inaudible] computers and like, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, oh, let -- just let me tell you, the -- the first guy I was talking to on here, he --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, actually hung up, right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no.
R:  Yeah, he hung up, like he didn't want to talk about the computer games.
L:  Oh, that's terrible.
R:  And I'm like, I don't like know exactly, 'cause they just told me like it was going to be a survey, like as if someone was going to call my house [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- and like ask me some questions, so I don't know how to -- is this your first time doing this?
L:  No, it's my third time.  I had to talk the first time about friends and the second time about bio terrorism [LAUGH] and now computer games.
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know, do you play any computer games? 
R:  No.  I don't even -- I'm more of, like, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't even have a computer, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't know about computer games.
L:  I just -- I --
R:  I have lots of friends that play computer games.
L:  Yeah, I've got -- I use the computer mostly just for, um -- for the, ah, email and, ah, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I've got -- I have to check my grades from in school [NOISE] --
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  -- um, once in a while, if I'm -- I'm at home -- I'm spending the summer at home, um, away from college so, I have a real slow computer here and my computer at school is faster, so I'll play computer games while I'm waiting on my email to load.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  'Cause I know a lot of kids -- you know, younger kids that play computer games.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of younger kids, because I used to baby sit these kids that played computer games.  I don't -- I never played things that are on CDRoms, but, ah, the ones that are on the internet I've played a few times.  [PAUSE] Ah --
R:  Okay, so you -- this is your -- this is your third time?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, 'cause this is just like my second.  I only got the number today, but, um -- so how does -- how does it like work?  I don't know like how it works -- I don't [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I -- I don't know, they just -- you talk for ten minutes and then they give you a little tone, it gives you like thirty seconds to say goodbye and then, um, that's it.  I haven't received, ah, like any type of money from it as yet, but I guess they -- I don't know, guess they send it to you later.
R:  Oh, yeah.  So, how did you hear about it?
L:  Um, I saw an advertisement in the, um, local paper.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, 'cause I heard of, um -- had heard through this, um, one guy that I go to school with, he was just talking about it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I was like, "Okay", because they -- how did they connected me, because I waited like almost like five minutes to be connected?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have no idea.  What part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm in California.
L:  Okay.  Well, I'm in Tennessee for now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, that's kind of funny.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's great --
R:  This is what --
L:  -- how the -- how the internet and the computers have, um, kind of just made everything like connected and technology's really good and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  you can -- you can just kind of use, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, used to take [several inaudible words] entertainment, I guess like for games and, you know, um, more fun [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- instead of, you know, I guess originally it was created for the military --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, then it kind of went through, you know, more business related fields, now it's -- everyone can use it, ah, it seems like only the [inaudible] you know, kids or our kids' kids, they're not going to know what it's like to not have a computer and to not have games and stuff [inaudible] I guess.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, I guess that'll be good.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I was talking to the guy with the computer games and he says, "This is weird", [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I'm like, "What's so weird about it?"  He says that like they called his house and then all he hears is like me introducing myself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  He was like, "This is too weird", he's like, "I gotta go, so take it easy".  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And he just like hung up on me.  It was like, "Oh, [LAUGH] that's too much".    Yeah, but I actually need to -- I need to purchase a computer because I actually just graduated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ha, high school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so, like, I'm ready to start college, so I needs a computer.  How did you -- is -- you really need a computer when you're in college, huh?
L:  Well, it's -- it -- you don't have to have one.  There's some -- some friends of mi- -- of mine don't have one, but, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's useful to do your word processing and, um, different types of, ah, projects, like you- you'll have like Cell[?] or, ah, Wordperfect, and different things you need to use and, ah, I guess depending on what you need to do, a lot of people use, like my friends who are computer science majors, they, ah -- they can get things on the computer for other people to play and I think they're projects so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's kind of interesting, um.  But, you know, it depends on your school, you can use a lot of libraries that have a computer you can use there, some of my friends do.  I go to U.T. Austin in -- in Texas.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because that [several inaudible words] um, that was my problem with high school, like it was really cool but, you know, like using their computer, like always having to stay, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- extra there using the computer.  I'm like, "I need to like get one".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they real -- really helpful and useful, um, and yes, a lot of people -- there's different types of games, like there -- they'll play solitaire or free cell or stuff like that, which is on the computer.  And the ones that I've played while I'm waiting for my email to load is, um, off of MSN dot com, which is a news kind of place and they have email stuff there, and it's a little game called Rumble Cube, it's kind of like Tetris but you have to -- I know they keep going up -- and have you played Tetris before? 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, you have to fit the little blocks, it's kind of -- it's just kind of something to do while you're waiting for something.  It just kind of a waste of time but something to keep you occupied I guess.
R:  Okay, yeah.  So, it's just -- so, are you in college now?
L:  Yeah, I'll be a senior in college, um, in August.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I'm -- I'm twenty one.
R:  Oh, that's really good, that's good.  Which college?
L:  Um, University of Texas at Austin.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, that's good.  I was thinking about going to, um, College of Louisiana but I'm like, "I don't know".  I guess I'll just in California [LAUGH] but --
L:  It's pretty far away.
R:  Yeah, and it's like a, you know -- they're really like different setting too so, I don't know.  But I'm really like, you know, a city girl [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the city it -- you know, I don't know, it just seems like, [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know, like is Tennessee like really like country south, 'cause I've never been out there.
L:  Different parts, I mean like there's a -- there's, ah, big cities, like Na- Nashville, Memphis and Knoxville, but in between them when you're driving to one or the other, there's a lot of farms.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  What part of California are you in?
R:  I'm at, um, Long Beach, California.
L:  Okay.  [MN] It's funny to think about the different, ah -- I'm sorry, I'm just trying to keep the conversation on what they tell you because I think [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.  They really, you know -- like I'm like, "What?"  Okay, ten minutes is a long time, you know, and want us to have a topic that you like --
L:  Yeah [several inaudible words].
R:  -- you know, really have nothing to say about.  [LAUGH] 'Cause the guy, we talked about it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and he just hung up 'cause he said he has nothing to say.  I'm like, "All right".
L:  Yeah, you just kind of have to keep going I guess.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm think- --
L:  Um, it's funny that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm sorry?  [NOISE] Oh, I don't know, I was just saying, it's funny to figure out the different age groups.  Like you're talking, are -- are you eighteen or nineteen?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I'm just a few years older but, you know, you're talking about little kids playing computer games and, um, I've seen commercials on television where, um, they're talking about, um, getting, ah, I guess AOL versus a cable modem or something else, um, and then it [inaudible] a dad playing computer games and it just kind of appeals to -- different games will appeal to all different age groups mainly because they all -- they all want something entertaining to do.
R:  Yeah, and they are different.  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's true.  Because I know, it was like -- I can't think of the name of the game, but it was some game that I used to play like when I was like kind of like a sophomore, [LAUGH] and it was -- it was fun, but it just sort of really only, you know, I never really was into it, 'cause I only got to play it at school, I didn't get to play it at home so --
L:  Yeah.  And I guess like games for younger kids are probably -- can be just as fun if -- can be educational as well as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- entertaining for them, but, you know, for us as adults it might not be as entertaining as it's educational just because, you know, we already know the basics of -- of, you know, reading and writing and math and those things aren't new concepts to us, so we just kind of want something more just, ah, social, [inaudible], I don't know.
R:  Yeah, and they're more like different.  'Cause I'm like, most of the games, you know, that a lot of little kids play, they're like, um -- more of like, well, I've seen like from like spelling games and stuff like that on the computers and like different like language, arts games and so, I -- I really used to play those like in elementary school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But now --
L:  And I guess we just as adults take those same concepts and just apply them differently if you think about, you know, Jeop- Jeopardy, Trivia or if you think about Wheel Of Fortune, it's kind of filling in blanks, it's -- it's not really filling but you have to know how to spell and you have to know -- and you think about different word games, you have to have a basic type of --
