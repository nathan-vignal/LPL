R:  What -- what do you like to play?
L:  Oh, um, [LIPSMACK] I usually go to Yahoo dot com for games.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, um, sometimes I play the word -- word games.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like -- kinda cross puzzles, but it's kinda more like digitalized.
R:  There -- there's some game where you have to make a lot of words -- different words out of, ah --
L:  Yeah, the same alphabet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's kind of fun.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's challenging, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then --
R:  And -- and you miss some of the simplest words, you know.  They're just, ah --
L:  Oh, I know.  It's like, oh, oh my god --
R:  They're sitting there, right there in front of you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you [inaudible] stupid, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  And then you just like, make up a word, and that's the answer.  I'm like, "That's a word?"
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And then like, I look up in the dictionary and that -- I don't know.  It's kinda fun.  But like, internet -- I don't really use -- play any like, the violent games.  I've -- I --
R:  No, I don't like those.
L:  [LAUGH] I've seen my guy friends play, but like, I've tried it once or twice, but like, neither I'm good at it, nor I like it.  So --
R:  The Sims thing.  Is that -- is that a game, or --
L:  Which -- what is it?
R:  There's a Sim -- Sim family.  Sim city?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's a game.  It's like, ah, you raise a family.  There's like different versions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, you can make a family, and then, like, you'll buy a home, and furnitures and all that.  And you can get the family members a job.  Yeah?
R:  Hm.
L:  So --
R:  I -- I've seen, ah -- heard people talk about it a lot, but --
L:  Oh?  It's -- it's fun, but it's kinda different kind of a game.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah?  It's good.  But I'm not too much of a game person.
R:  Our family is, though.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Very into games.  Very challenging.
L:  Really?
R:  And, ah, the -- we have -- I have, ah, a little niece and nephew.  They're --

R:  And they're not allowed to cheat, and they're --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they play to win.  They know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They have to play to win, 'cause nobody's gonna give them a break.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And they're really into it.  They r- r- really into games.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everybody in the family is.
L:  Usually I don't like to play games, but like -- even if it's on the internet, I don't like to play games with other people.  But I like the games that I can do just by myself.
R:  Like solitaire?
L:  Yeah.  Like solitaire.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I don't know why.  It's --
R:  I like to play at work, when no one's around, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm just trying to waste some time.  I do the cards, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Huh.
L:  Where -- when do you usually play the games?
R:  Ah, at -- at night at home.  When I get home.
L:  Mhm.  After work?
R:  After work.  But at work, I like to play, though.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The little card game type of things.
L:  I see.
R:  Just to make the time pass.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah [LAUGH], me too.  Just to kill --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- time and stuff.  Yeah.  [SIGH] Is this your first call?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  I believe I got one two weeks ago, and I didn't know what it was and [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  My brother hung it up, 'cause he thought it was telemarketing stuff.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I did too.  You know, who'd call this late?  And then I -- I thought, "Oh, wait a minute".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is -- so is this you're first call?
L:  Huh?
R:  Is this your first call?
L:  Yeah.  This is my first call.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I was kind be- -- getting worried that it might be awkward.
R:  Ah, y- --
L:  I don't mind if we're allowed to get off the topic, but it [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, okay.
R:  Well, how much can you say about compu- -- well, like, they said computer games, right?
L:  Let's see.  Ah, what else is there about computer games.
R:  They said something about CD roms.
L:  CD rom?
R:  Um, do you play off the computer, or a CD rom?
L:  Oh, I'm not that dedicated to computer games.  Like, if I have a CD, and if it's a good game I'll -- I'll play it.  But I'm not gonna go out and buy the CDs.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Ah, we've gotten, ah, things like, [LIPSMACK] crossword puzzle --
L:  Yeah.  Ah --
R:  -- type, ah, CD roms, and haven't even ever played 'em.  You know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there still -- still sealed in the packs with Jeopardy.  Still sealed in the package.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I --
L:  Wh- wh- where do you play Tetris?  I've tried to find a site for that.
R:  Um, ah, Microsoft -- no.  Where is it?  [NOISE] What is it?  Um, [LIPSMACK] there's a place of -- there's Bejeweled, and things like that, that's like Tetris.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I think we go to Microsoft games.
L:  Microsoft games?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't -- you don't pay to play games, right?
R:  No, I don't ever pay.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  'Cause, ah, all the Tetris sites that I found, were like, oh, you have to pay [inaudible] to play this game.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  I was like, "Forget that".
R:  And the casino things.  Oh, I never would do that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so I'm like, "Ah, I don't wanna play that desperately".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- yeah, I still, you know, like Tetris.  I like old fashioned games.
R:  Yeah, I do to.  I -- I used to love to play, um -- oh, what was that one?  Galaxy, or something and you'd sh- --
L:  Oh, oh, I know what you're talking about.
R:  Oh, I just loved that one.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I -- I liked that, too.  But I was never too good at it [NOISE].  Hello?
R:  I -- I -- yeah, I'm still here.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, um, hm.  Just trying to --
R:  What other kind of games are there?
L:  I like solitaire.
R:  I do, too.  Have you ever played Free Cell?
L:  Uh-uh.  I never figured how to -- how to, um, play that game.
R:  I -- I like it.  And I win that one a lot.  I never win Solitaire [LAUGH].
L:  How do you -- how do you play that, Free Cell.
R:  Well, you have to do the -- the black on the red again. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you have to -- th- the -- the four cards on the left -- or the four spaces on the left --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can put cards up there to just kind of sit 'em.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And get 'em out of the way.
L:  Oh.
R:  But you kinda have to be careful, because you only have -- you know, you have to be able to bring 'em back --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so that you can move things around.
L:  Huh.
R:  You try to get out the aces, and things like that, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I love Free Cell. 
L:  Huh.
R:  I -- I play that one at work, a lot.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  And I also u- -- I love Hearts.  I don't have that one --
L:  Oh, you don't.
R:  -- at work.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I love to play Hearts.
L:  Which Windows do you have?
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I just got a new one.  XP I think.
L:  Oh, XP should have everything.  It, um -- actually I'm on the computer right now.  It has Free Cell, Hearts, and Solitaire, Minesweeper.  I -- I play mineswee- sweeper, too.
R:  Minesweeper.  I can't figure that one out.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Took me a while.  My room mate is crazy about that game.  She plays that all day.
R:  I can't figure out the point [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I say --
L:  You have to use the, um, both buttons on the mouse.  The right one and the left one.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  I've never -- I didn't know that.
L:  Yup.
R:  Oh.  I've only used, ever, the left one I guess.
L:  Mhm.  If you, um, click on the right, ah, button of the mouse, it tells you like, the potential mines. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So you have to choose one.
R:  Oh.
L:  It gets kinda tricky, but I figured it out after a while.  So --
R:  I like watching it when you click on it and the whole --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- area goes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I usually -- I usually get the mines [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it's a good game.
R:  But I like Hearts, because we always played Hearts as kids.  That's, ah, with my uncle in there.  He always wanted to sweep you -- always --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  -- wanted to sweep.  Every hand.  It was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was the -- he was gonna sweep, you know?  He didn't care.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my sister was the type where every hand, she wouldn't pick a trick.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  So she always would have the lowest score.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And then my uncle would try to sweep and get -- you know, when you sweep you get --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everybody else gets a score.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't -- I l- -- I love playing Hearts.
L:  That's cool.
R:  But I don't have that one at work.
L:  Oh.
R:  At work I just have Free Cell, and at work I have, ah, I think, Windows two thousand.
L:  Windows two thousand?  I'm not really sure about Windows two thousand, but I have XP right now [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But XP has everything.  It h- -- it has the Hearts, and Free Cell, and Solitaire.
R:  I'll have to check it out.
L:  Yeah, it's on the --
R:  Downstairs.
L:  -- start menu.  And then if you go to programs, it's under games.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well, I don't play that -- the games for a long time when I'm in school.  I'm in college right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But since it's summer break and all, I have a lot of time to kill.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  So --
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  On with the games [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  So -- we're together.  Yeah, 'cause I'm -- w- -- how much time do we have to do?
R:  They said ten minutes.  It's -- should be that very soon now [NOISE].
L:  They'll say, you have -- you have five minutes left, or something like that.  I don't know how this works at all.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE].  How did you know about the [NOISE] program? 
R:  I heard about it at, ah, Flyer Talk.
L:  Oh, you did.
R:  Have you ever heard of Flyer Talk.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's, ah, where people go for frequent flyer miles, to learn how to get miles --
