R:  Hi, my name is Elaine.
L:  Hi, Elaine.  Um, I would say I get, um, initially most of my news, um, online, you know, one website, not so much from newspaper, occasionally from TV or radio.  But, um, mostly, yeah, I'm -- I'm pretty much up to date online.
R:  Yeah, I get online -- online too, but I also get it on [NOISE] the -- the TV and I read [NOISE] the newspapers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, too [NOISE] to get the -- to get the, uh, you know, news.

R:  -- I think it's, [NOISE] um, AOL. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I actually, um, actually, frankly, I've heard it goes in a lot of detail.  It -- once in a while I'll just check with SM[?], see if they're running the same stories, e- even if they are going to carry, um, [inaudible] carry additional stories with -- you know, with [inaudible] still, so it's pretty, uh, pretty comprehensive that way.
R:  Oh, right, right, right, yeah.
L:  What, uh, what newspaper do you get?
R:  Well, I get the, uh, depending where you're from, you know, but I'm -- I live in New York and I get it -- I -- y- y- you know, I live on Long Island and I get --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it from the [inaudible]
L:  Okay, I'm -- I'm actually in Brooklyn and I --
R:  Oh, well, [inaudible]
L:  -- but, uh, I -- I -- I, uh, placed a script -- subscribed to the [inaudible] a while ago.
R:  Oh, that's how I --
L:  You just go on -- look online to get it, if ever I, you know, if I have the time to check it. [LAUGH] Some days I just -- yeah, have time to look at, you know, Yahoo or whatever.
R:  Right, right, right [inaudible]
L:  But ...
R:  Right, I --
L:  So, are there any particular kind of events, uh, that, uh, that have [inaudible] you, I guess?
R:  Well, the war, the -- you know, the war in Iraq.
L:  Mhm.

R:  She was old, so she had a good life.  That's really it.  That's really, you know [LAUGH] then you have but yourself.
L:  Um, I did -- yeah, I -- I been told back in, um, middle Asia and, you know, the Iraq thing, that was all I'm trying to figure out.  Now, are we going on to that at this rate, you know, if -- I know King Hussein is still around and -- and, uh --
R:  Yeah, he probably is.
L:  -- just think that -- I don't think that suddenly the -- there's always the prospect that if a -- and I don't what's worse is -- is -- you know, like the things like for losing our soldiers now with these isolated attacks and [inaudible] for so ...
R:  Well, we're -- yeah, that's what happens and -- that's what happens when you're in war, I think people get, uh, killed.
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  But there you go.  You know, they're still -- they're still alive. [MN] Yeah.  Poor things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, all the other ones are probably still alive that were --

L:  Right.  So, um, have you -- the other papers [inaudible] newspaper, do you prefer Newsday or the other ones, uh ...?

L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They have all different, you know -- you know, articles, you know, um, the effect of the war on Long Island, you know, um, in the [inaudible]

R:  Oh, are you -- are you behind the scenes?
L:  -- in -- on the -- on the technology [inaudible]
R:  Oh, in the technology?
L:  Yeah, that's about all.  I -- I -- you know, besides getting [inaudible] it's interesting to see how the -- if the news is already, you know, broadcasting information and all that.
R:  Oh, right, right, right.  So ...
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [NOISE] are there -- are there, um, i- in terms of the -- what -- what the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- news channels do you prefer?

L:  Do -- do you have a -- do you have a favorite TV channel for news or ...?
R:  Not really.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  I guess it's -- most of the time I choose Channel Five.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And how about yourself?
L:  Um, once in a while the New York one or whatever but, um, [inaudible] I -- I get a lot of, you know, news from -- and from the ra- -- actually more fro- -- just from the radio, uh, you know, and sometimes if -- if I wanna get, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] news or whatever but, um, [NOISE] I decided that I'm not a [inaudible] watcher because I don't have it, so ...
R:  Right, right, right.  So, kinda lost. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what else to say.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, yeah, it co- -- comes down to a very kind of boring view of --
R:  Oh, yeah, I'll [inaudible] you know? [inaudible]
L:  And it -- and they -- it, um, how about the rest of your family, they don't have any specific news sources that they like or are they -- you --
R:  Well, they w- -- they do it on the, uh, on the computer, on the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, on the internet, you know, or -- well, you know, my -- we have two child -- two children, my son and my daughter, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they, uh, they go on the internet and they watch, uh, [inaudible] channel, uh, Two News they like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [several inaudible words] on the internet after --
L:  Do they have to do projects at school, like that are on -- on events sometimes, or ...?
R:  Well, they are at -- they are at -- my -- the other side of school.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, they have a [inaudible] week, you know, current events or ... yeah, or -- or, well, my daughter, well, she's in college, she needed some current events, so she got some articles from, uh, from a [inaudible] from, you know, the, uh, on the internet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that time. [inaudible] younger they got it from the -- the internet [MN] so --
L:  Do -- do you believe most of the stuff that's reported in there?
R:  Not re- -- not in [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
L:  No, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you think some of it might be sensationalized just for --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, you're right.  Well, how about yourself, huh?
L:  Um, I don't know, I -- w- w- [MN] I think that the bigger net- -- like TV networks, I think, the -- you know, they try and they [inaudible] great images and, you know, really rely on --
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  -- it kind of is like the -- the medium that they're in but, um, and I think [several inaudible words] or when there's other -- other -- their [inaudible] stories aren't being reported.  You're only getting one -- one view of -- of what's going on sometimes.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  So, it can get pretty tricky.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- trying to think, w- -- do you have a- a- -- I know you -- you live in Long Island, but do you have any outside kind of [inaudible] for example or -- in -- in stuff that has been in the news recently for -- I mean, they've got a pretty low disapproval rating.
R:  Right, right, yeah.  But, uh, the main one we had, he's not allowed to be Mayor for more -- you know, we had before. [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  He doesn't, uh,  really -- really help the people.  I don't think he's really helped the people much, um, people are now losing their jobs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's because of -- yeah, because of him.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, amazing, you know, the, uh, the trains --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, wasn't their idea.
L:  [MN] Did -- did you get hurt -- accept [inaudible] commuter tax or did you -- do you -- do you have to go into the city for your job?
R:  Well, my husband -- husband works in, uh, Manhattan.
