R:  Um, I just saw Twenty Eight Days Later.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That, um, English film --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was actually really good.
L:  Really?
R:  I liked it.  It was not really what I expected.  It was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a little, you know, European.  There was some nudity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which was a little unexpected --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, um, it was -- it was scary, it was good.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, scary, I don't -- I don't like too many scary movies.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It made me jump a few times, yeah.
L:  Oh, really?  Now, have you seen The --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Panic Room?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's good.
R:  I liked that.
L:  Yeah, that's -- now that's --
R:  That was really good.
L:  -- that's a --
R:  Mm.
L:  one that'll make you jump.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it -- oh, my goodness, I was so scared.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I saw it with my cousin and like we were holding each others hands and just freaking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- out.  It was cool.
L:  Wow, now Dwight Yoakam, he was the one that got his hand caught in the door?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, okay, okay.  Yeah, I thought that was really good.  Um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, okay, the last DVD that I saw, [LAUGH] -- actually, I bought one last night but we haven't watched it yet.  Um, I saw the, it's a motor -- it's a motorcycle, no, a car o- one that's like, um -- no this is the motorcycle, something like The Fast and Furious.
R:  Okay, yes, The Fast and Furious.
L:  Yeah, um, is it Night Rider or something like that, um --
R:  Oh, um --
L:  -- it's -- it's the one where they're riding the motorcycles.
R:  Um, I can't rem- -- hey [inaudible] do you remember that, ah, new movie that came out with the motorcycles?
L:  Well now, this one's, it's kind of couple mo- -- it's several months old.  It just came out on DVD.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  Um, I remember that one too, how's that [LIPSMACK] [LAUGH] --
L:  I can't think of the name of it though.
R:  -- That guy in it, um --
L:  Wasn't that kid -- rap kid, I think kid --
R:  [NOISE] Wasn't it Orlando?  It wasn't -- did -- did it have Ludacris in it or Orlando, ooh, Williams?
L:  No, I think Ludacris was in it, but Kid Rock was in it too.
R:  Okay, um, shoot, I don't know, I don't think I saw it.
L:  Okay, yeah, Kid Rock was in it 'cause he was one of the judges when they, um, told whether these kids could ride or not.
R:  Okay.  Oh, I remember that, um --
L:  I can't think.
R:  -- I can't see it, no guys wanted to see it, that's why we didn't see it.
L:  [LAUGH] It was good but, um, I haven't seen the new Fast And Furious --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've seen the old one.
R:  I've heard it's really good, I haven't seen it --
L:  Really?
R:  -- personally, but --
L:  It's so loud.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they -- they said it was better than the first one.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, really?
R:  Which should be pretty good.
L:  Mhm, oh, okay.  Um, and I like, um, I've seen both of Vin Diesels movies, um, well, the Fast And Furious and then he has another movie that's really good.
R:  Ah, there's Triple X --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and --
L:  Have you seen that?
R:  Yes, I've --
L:  That's good.  
R:  -- I saw that one.
L:  Yeah, I --  
R:  That was good, I saw that, but --
L:  -- I'm sure, when he was skiing down those slopes, I don't think that was -- I think a lot of that was, um, [LIPSMACK] what do you call it, um?
R:  Oh, like animated, or like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- digital effects, something?
L:  Yeah, there's no way you could go that fast I don't think.
R:  Yeah, that was craz- -- that was weird --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I would hate to be that skier, even though, wow, I'm not very good at skiing.
L:  Ah, especially when he's out running that avalanche.
R:  Yes, it'd be so scary.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I couldn't imagine doing that.
L:  Okay.
R:  I can't even like go fast enough down like the bunny hill.
L:  [LAUGH] This is weird, 'cause my last two ones were about, um, holidays --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were about holidays, so we had to say what our favorite holiday was [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- and why we liked it, mhm.  They ask -- they ask some questions that it's kind of hard for you to stay on topic for ten minutes.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, so [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Um, what was some other ones, I forgot, I think friends were one, the last one I participated in, but sometimes they call me when I'm actually out with people and I can't talk.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] Yeah, but --
L:  They like to call late at night too.
R:  Yes.
L:  And then -- and then I know that they caught me last week, I think it was last Sunday, and they caught me about eleven something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at night --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they couldn't find another participant and I waited for the first time and then they came back and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- said that they still couldn't find one so I just said I didn't want to hold any more.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, hm, [LIPSMACK] and I work another job at home on the phone and they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- were calling me so much that I had to take my call waiting off.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's a lot.
L:  Yeah, be- -- well, two of my jobs that I do at home part time, um, they listen, your supervisors listen to you so you never know when they're listening and if they hear a beep, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I thought I better take this off or I get in trouble.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, let's see, we still have, I think, about three minutes don't we?
R:  Yes, I think so.
L:  Okay, we gotta talk about another movie, mm, hm, hm.
R:  All right.
L:  Um, let's see.
R:  Do you want to see --
L:  I started to -- to buy that DVD with the kangaroo.
R:  The kangaroo.
L:  But I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really know what it's about.  It's a new --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.  [NOISE]
L:  -- DVD movie that just came out and it's something about kangaroo.
R:  Oh, like Kangaroo Jack?
L:  Yeah, what is that?
R:  I don't know, I didn't see it.  It, um -- it looks pretty good, I didn't see it at the movie theater, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was like PG or something.  I just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- one of the guys reminded me of one of my friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I'd kind of like gone out with so I didn't want to see it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, it's like about the kangaroo runs off with all their money --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or they find a lot of money and he goes off.
L:  Is that with, um -- what's his name, um, was he Philippine --
R:  [NOISE] I have no i- --
L:  -- is that the one with ah, ah, che- -- ah, Legu- -- what's his name, +Leguizamo or isn't he in that?
R:  I have no idea.  I -- I don't remember people's names.
L:  Oh, okay.  I always call him Chi Chi Rodriguez [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I think his name is +Leguizamo or something, he's a comedian.
R:  Oh, I --
L:  I think he's in it.
R:  -- think that -- that sounds right.  I --
L:  Um, I can't think of what his name is.  Oh, I always call him Chi Chi Rodriguez because that movie, The King.  [LAUGH] Do you -- I don't know if you remember this or not, um, [LIPSMACK] the one with, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes and this guy, they were in -- they were drag queens.  Did you see that?
R:  I don't -- I think I -- does it come on TV sometimes?
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  I think I saw it.
L:  Okay.  I think he's the one, John +Leguizamo or something like that, I think he might be in that kangaroo movie if I'm not mistaken, but I'm not sure.  I didn't want to pay twenty dollars for it and I didn't know for sure [LAUGH] what it was about.
R:  Yeah, I don't know how good it would have been --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, the kangaroo it -- it was a talking kangaroo --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is kind -- you know, didn't --
L:  Did you see, um, um, [LIPSMACK] -- what's that one about the Greek wedding?
R:  Oh, My Big Fat Gr- Greek Wedding?
L:  Yeah.  Did you see that?
R:  Oh, I saw that and I loved it.  I saw it with my mom.
L:  I loved it too.  I ordered it off our on demand.  I watched it three times.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow, I was --
L:  I thought it was so good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my mom's seen it a few times.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, My Big Fat Greed Wedding, Dan.  [NOISE]
L:  And I liked --
R:  The Hulk.
L:  -- Sweet Home Alabama.
R:  Sweet Home -- I have not seen that but I'm -- I was born in Alabama, so I should probably see it.
L:  Oh, really?  Now, have you seen Legally Blond Two?
R:  Not, ah -- not that one yet.  I don't know if it's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- come out here yet.
