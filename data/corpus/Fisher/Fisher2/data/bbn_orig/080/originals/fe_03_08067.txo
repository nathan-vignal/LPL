R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]  This is Mary and I'm in Tampa, Florida.
L:  This is Shirley and I'm in Arbor, New York.
R:  Well, hi, Shirley.  How are you?
L:  Well, good.  How do you hear about your, um, uh, current events?
R:  I don't watch much T.V., especially during the day because I work out of my house at home.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah.  So, I get all of my news online from C.N.N. dot com.
L:  Oh, I -- I look at the news in the morning.  It's, uh, quite interesting a lotta things that they have and, uh, we get two newspapers --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and, uh, you get a lot of current events out of the newspapers, especially with, uh, the, uh, war that we just got done with, you know?
R:  Yeah.  It did make the papers.  Yes.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Well, I us- -- I did take a paper for a while, but I have to lug my trash up to -- to a dumpster to get rid of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- 'cause I'm kinda in the woods.  So, I wound up just carrying it up there without reading it so I decided they were not paying me enough [LAUGH] to do that work.  So, I -- I stopped taking the paper.
L:  Well, we -- we often go to -- to breakfast at a local place here and it's amazing how many people will get together, uh, and will ta- -- will talk about current events.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's really quite neat.  You're eating your breakfast and you're talking to people.
R:  Especially about what's going on.  I notice going out that a lotta places, even like Cash and Carry and the K. Marts and things --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they have television sets in their lunch rooms -- not lunch rooms, but the -- the little place in there where you buy food -- the cafes.
L:  Yes.  I -- and -- and also in some of our local banks here they do that in the room where they have their lunch they have the T.V.s so they can keep up on the news.
R:  And I saw a lot more of that once the war started.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  There was a lot more interest in what was on television at that time.
L:  And, uh, during -- when the war was going on we had a lotta people coming around, uh, talking to us about various things in the neighborhood, walking around, you know, the mayor and so forth.
R:  Ah.
L:  It was quite amazing people would do that.
R:  Yes.  It is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We didn't see anything like that.
L:  No?  Uh, they, uh -- they've come around here and, uh, um, there's a place down the road from us, um, like a meeting hall --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where, uh, a lotta people will get together and, uh, they discuss various things like that.  What do you think of that?  And what do you think of what happened in the war?  And would you do anything any differently?  That's quite interesting.  We went to that a couple of times to listen and to say what we thought.
R:  Yeah.  That's good to -- to do, to share your opinions with your neighbors 'cause it's interesting to get their take on things.
L:  It -- it certainly is.  How do you, uh -- mostly with the computer you hear -- you do -- you hear about current events?
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I go to C.N.N. dot com every morning with my morning coffee [LAUGH] --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- and then read the headlines while I'm trying to wake up.  I work online, but I don't wanna start until I'm -- I've had enough coffee in me to be awake.
L:  I -- well, I -- both my husband and I are retired and, uh, so we look at the -- the T.V., but we are craft show people.  We sell jam and jelly at craft shows --
R:  Oh, how neat.
L:  -- and that's quite interesting because people will talk about all kinds of things there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they'll say, "Now, do you have any relatives that are in the service?" or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, "Have you seen Hillary Clinton?"  You know, Hillary Clinton has been quite, um, uh, known in our area here because her and her husband they've come over to Skaneateles[?] and, uh, they've stayed there and they've gone to our New York State Fair.  So, she's quite on everybody's mind and with her new book she's been on everybody's mind --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- here too.
R:  Yeah.  It's doing quite well.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.  It is.
R:  Right up there with Harry Potter.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  And I haven't read either one.  [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't read either one either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Whereabouts in New York are you?
L:  We're in the Finger Lakes.
R:  In the Finger Lakes?
L:  Yep.
R:  I'm not real sure what that is.  I ...
L:  Right.  If you look at a map of New York State we're strictly in the middle.
R:  Right up ...  I was born in Norwich, New York.
L:  Oh, we do a craft show in Norwich.
R:  I'm surprised Norwich is still there.  It was so tiny the last time I saw it.
L:  It -- well, it still is, but it's gotten a lot bigger.  It -- it truly has.  What kind of, um, uh -- do you talk with anybody about current events down there?
R:  Not really.
L:  No?
R:  Just our neighbors and friends but, uh, not -- I don't -- we used to ...
L:  Do you get any positive opinions on any other things going on of who you do talk with?
R:  Well, I just got off the phone a few minutes ago with a friend who was laughing because California is trying to impeach their governor for making them go bankrupt.
L:  Oh, my!
R:  And I came from California.  So, that -- I just happened to be on C.N.N. dot com right now 'cause I went -- I didn't see anything about it this morning, but I went back this afternoon and there is out there on the budget -- apparently they're having a lot of budget problems out there, but that's what they get for over regulating themselves.
L:  I tell ya, we just got back from a trip to Massachusetts and, uh, there have been, you know, children missing all over the place and --
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  -- one ...
R:  Yeah.  Massachusetts is having some problems.
L:  Yes.  And one -- one girl had just been found.
R:  Oh.
L:  I felt better for the family that the girl had been found finally.  But boy, that had been in the news for so long and, uh, now it's over and they're I guess gonna try and help other people because of it.
R:  Yeah.  California just had a case like that not too long ago too with -- with a missing girl and she was -- I don't think they found her alive though.
L:  That's -- that's sad.  That -- I heard just recently there was one -- maybe it was out there, I'm not sure where it was -- but they did find her alive.  The, um -- with the missing children and so forth, um, uh -- have you heard of, uh, Mr. Welsh?
R:  Is he the one who lost his daughter --
L:  He ...
R:  -- and he does America's Most Wanted?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Yes.  I'd seen him.  Not a bad looking man.
L:  Yes.  He -- he came from our area.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, we're very familiar and, um, who he is and so forth and I like to watch that and, uh, hear about the missing children.  It's kind of interesting.
R:  Yeah.  And it's -- it's -- it's good to know that -- that -- that it gets a following, that there are people willing to fall in -- in behind and support it.
L:  And our --
R:  Even the airtime is a blessing. 
L:  -- our biggest event in our area right -- in our particular area right now are the Indians.  We have, uh, Indian tribes throughout New York State --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that want to take back their land and, uh, all along the different lakes they say is their land and that's, uh -- they have people that are -- they're building casinos all over the place here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and people are very much at arms -- up -- up in arms about it, they don't like it, they don't want it and, uh, it's very much on everybody's mind.
R:  Wow!  Well, we have Indians down here too and they have a casino here in Tampa.  They have always had a huge tobacco store here in Tampa and then they added on a little site next to it where they had -- they sold bingo -- they played bingo, then ...
L:  Well, this is what they're trying to do in our area, but the, uh, uh, people will not let them start their building.  But they did buy a gas station and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they're charging, uh, the price for gas with no tax on it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and of course nobody likes that.  [LAUGH]
R:  There's no tax on the cigarettes either because being a sub nation they aren't taxable.
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  But down here everybody loves it.  They flock to the cigarette store out there.
L:  Well, I -- I don't know why -- I don't know why, uh -- why everybody's so much against it.  I think they're afraid they're gonna lose their houses, you know, if they take back their land, uh, they'll take back -- there's a lotta people that have houses on the land that they're claiming and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, I think people are just afraid they're gonna lose their house and won't know where to live and what to do.
R:  Yeah.  That might be.  That is scary.  But ...
L:  But that's a -- that's a big thing throughout New York State.  They, um, are trying to do some of it down state and, uh, that's really a big, big, huge current event in our area.  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess it is.  Talk about having a local impact.
L:  Very.
R:  Now, are the tribes up there united or are they all different?
L:  They're all different.  Uh, we have one called the Cayuga Nation, we have one called the Oneida Nation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the Seneca Nation and, uh, they're just -- everybody's creating havoc all over the place.  I say why don't you just let 'em have it and do it?
R:  Let 'em have one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  See, we only have one.  The bingo hall is now a casino, but very nicely done.  I've been inside and you'd swear you were in Las Vegas.
L:  But they don't want to let anybody have any of it, which is sad.
R:  Yeah.  Because -- well, we have one down here and it's not a problem, but the biggest problem we had recently down here was we have a large Muslim population and right away they had extra security at all the mosques and everything because with the Red Neck Sultan you never know.  But, uh, Tampa was very well behaved.
L:  Good.
R:  It was a bit of a surprise, but everybody was.
L:  Well, not everybody here.
R:  Mm.
L:  I wished it was, but it's not going that way.  We're also keeping our eyes on, uh, the Medicare -- Medicare, uh, reform that they're trying to do in Washington.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Being the age that we are -- I don't know how old you are [LAUGH] --
R:  I'm fifty five.
L:  -- well [COUGH], being the age that we are, you know, Medicare is very important to us and it --
R:  Yes.  It is.
L:  -- it would be very nice to get prescriptions covered and things like that.
R:  I cannot believe the price of prescription drugs.  I cannot believe it.
L:  They are so high.
R:  I don't have to take any medication of any kind, but I went to pick up some drugs for my next door neighbor.  I live in -- in a retirement community.  And I couldn't pick it up for her 'cause the paperwork wasn't right and it was two hundred dollars a month for this drug and it was --
L:  Oh, my!
R:  -- it was not a party drug, you know, it was a blood pressure thing or something.
L:  Well, I really hope that they'll pass that to get those -- the drug prices and the prescriptions, especially for the seniors, reduced.
R:  Certainly.  I ...
L:  You know?  Uh, they're -- there are people on retirement or just plain social security they don't have the money --
