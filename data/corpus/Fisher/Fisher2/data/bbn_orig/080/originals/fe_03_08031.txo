L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  I'm Margaret.
L:  Oh, hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm Sandy.
R:  How are you?
L:  I wasn't sure anybody was gonna be there because the last time I got one of these calls [MN] I sat for ten minutes and nobody ever came on the line.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [LAUGH] So, I don't know if I got credit or not for that one.
R:  Oh.
L:  I kept saying, "Hello", but nobody came on so.
R:  Ah, I don't think they do give credit if you don't end up talking to anyone.
L:  Yeah, but I stayed on the line for ten minutes, so I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, hopefully you did.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That would have been very easy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, topic is computer games, and I don't play computer games.
R:  [LAUGH] I barely do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, well, I don't now.  I have before but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but not much.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, have you ever --
L:  I was just -- go ahead.
R:  Go -- have you ever played one?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] other than Solitaire, probably not, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH] ah, now I do play that, yeah, I didn't even think about that.
L:  On the computer, mhm?
R:  Yeah.  That [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  As far as the Playstation and all that, no I don't --
R:  No.
L:  -- and I don't know if that's what they're talking about.
R:  Oh I'd say any kind of game would count.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, my -- my son does, and he's two.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And gets on Nick Junior --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, online --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- Nickelodeon Junior and plays all those little games related --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to the shows and he's pretty good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, yeah, Solitaire, there's a card game called Millborne[?] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think it's a French card game, I've got that that I play sometimes and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Flip over, which is a matching game of about, I think there are thirty two little squares in a grid and you have to -- you can only turn over two at a time and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- then you have to try to remember where they were and match --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well, as I was getting to learn the computer I guess I practiced with Solitaire to learn the mouse and that --
R:  Oh, yeah, that would be good for that.
L:  -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] -- did you get into this study from, um, the comp- -- the computer, from the internet?
R:  Yeah, I did from, ah, money and shopping dot com [inaudible].
L:  Money and shopping.
R:  Yeah, it's a site where you can do surveys --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, not surveys, secret shopping --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and now they have a survey thing too but --
L:  Mystery shopping.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How did you find out it?
L:  Um, I think it was probably from refunding makes sense, that -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that web site, RMC --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- refunding makes -- it started with a refunding magazine and then they developed a web site.
R:  What is refunding?
L:  What is it?
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, it's just, you know, sending in for rebates and things like that and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, getting every nickel that you can [LAUGH] out of different things, like mystery shopping and, I used to do that too a while back when -- did different restaurants and that.
R:  Did you like it?
L:  It was okay.
R:  Is it more trouble than it's worth?
L:  Sometimes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, occasionally we had a really good restaurant that we'd get and that was fun.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  Did they ever know that you were the mystery shopper?
L:  I don't think so, no.
R:  Oh.
L:  But then you had to fill out a lot of forms, you know, after.
R:  Yeah, and get 'em in really quickly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so I'm in -- I -- I live in Milwaukee, so there wasn't a whole lot of demand.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, it didn't seem that like they'd -- they had a lot of sites -- places to do the mystery shopping around here.
R:  That's a pretty big city isn't it?
L:  Fairly -- fairly big.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, Cookeville, Tennessee.  It's a little --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- rural --
L:  Sounded like you were from the south.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I grew up in Memphis but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then moved here.  This is a town of about thirty thousand.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband has an aunt and uncle in Sevierville.
R:  Oh yeah, Dolly Parton land.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Fate.
R:  Yeah, there's even a Dollywood there.  Have you been to that?
L:  Yep.  No -- no, but we did visit them once, but we didn't go to Dollyville, no.
R:  Oh, yeah, you're probably better off without it [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's pretty cheesy.
L:  Yeah, I imagine.
R:  Yeah, but, ah, you ought to hit Gatlinburg some time if you're down this way, that's a nice -- I mean, it's -- it kind of has the -- the red neck strip of, you know, little shops, but it has some nice -- nice stores too and some beautiful little places to stay, um, overlooking the water with fire places and jacuzzis and that's pretty nice.
L:  Hm.  We're planning a big -- my husband and I are planning a big driving trip this next month for three weeks we're going west and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- driving to, um, [LIPSMACK] the black hills and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- um, we're gonna go through, um, [LIPSMACK] Colorado and Utah and then out to California, and down to the Grand Canyon and back --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- through, um, Dallas and, um, up through Branson and, ah, back home.  [LAUGH]
R:  That sounds good.
L:  Three weeks we're gonna take to drive.
R:  Oh, good.  You'll have time to really enjoy it.
L:  I hope so.  I hope it'll be enjoyable; we're really looking forward to getting away.
R:  I bet.
L:  Mm.  You have one little one?
R:  Yeah, he's two.
L:  Two?
R:  Yeah, that's all.
L:  Ah.
R:  I mean, that's the only one we have, probably the only one we will have too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But that's a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we're going to go to Florida here in a couple of weeks.
L:  Oh.
R:  Pretty low key, and we're gonna spend about a week there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So yeah, with -- with him I have no time for games.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But even before him, I just -- I feel like they're a waste of time mostly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] There's so many other things I could be doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.
L:  Yeah, computer games -- I don't know, even the ones that you buy, you know, and -- and, ah, download and all that, they seem to take up a lot of space too don't they --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- on your computer and -- and -- and -- and effect how it -- how fast it goes and everything.
R:  Yeah, they can, depending on how much memory you have on your computer, they can eat up a lot of it.  I have one friend who spends almost all his time playing online games --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, where you're playing with actual other people but --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- through the internet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he really gets into it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel sorry for his wife.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But then maybe she's better off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Some people do get into that and it's addicting I guess.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But the good thing is he hooks up with a lot of his local friends, you know, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they play through there and that's, I guess, a way to bond --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I couldn't sit for that long.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I spend a lot of time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just shopping online too.  I was, in fact there was a  -- somebody just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pointed out a really good deal at the Home Shopping Network --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on, um, the -- on the internet, um, it's a -- a tupperware set for -- for regularly a hundred some dollars, for seventeen.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Wow.
L:  I thought that might be a good Christmas present for somebody.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Especially if you could get a code to go with it and get a little discount or something.
R:  So, do you, um, look for these kinds of deals all the time and come across good bargains like this?
L:  Yeah, on this refunding makes sense site there's a lot of chitchat about what the good deals are and where to go to get things. My attic is full of stuff [LAUGH] --
R:  Really?
L:  -- for Christmas.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  But, um, sometimes I have to really restrain myself and not buy too much.
R:  Huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I could see how it could easily get out of hand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But boy, I bet it saves you a fortune on gifts.
L:  Yeah, if you -- if you buy at the right time and you set it aside.  I've got, um, six kids and six grandchildren so --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- um, got a lot of presents to buy for so -- a lot of people to buy presents for, [SIGH] so, my daughter always says I have too much stuff though, but.
R:  [LAUGH] But it sounds like you have a place to put it.
L:  Yeah, got a big attic, mhm, mhm.  So, I'm debating whether or not to buy that, just don't know.  And then they have some really cute red white and blue place mats too for s- -- on sale.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I don't think they'd come in time for the fourth.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But they'd make a good gift for my sister, [LIPSMACK] she likes red white and blue things and so -- her birthday's in August.  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, well that would be perfect.
L:  That noise is our -- I'm at work and they're doing payroll on the folder, they're folding checks.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Such a noisy machine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  And they have to do that almost all day long on --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- every other week --
