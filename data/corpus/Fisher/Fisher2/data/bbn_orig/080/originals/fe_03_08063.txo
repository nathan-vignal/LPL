L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  My name is Betty.
R:  I'm Becky.
L:  Hi, Becky.  Um, have you done this before?
R:  This -- yes, I have.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, good because I haven't.  This is my very first time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  It's fun.
L:  Okay.
R:  Last time I got to talk about perjury.  So, this is a much better topic than ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, right.  This is computer games.  So, do you have Internet access and do you play them?
R:  Um, I don't play them on the Internet.  I'm a C.D. Rom type of girl --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I'm a -- I'm a strategy simulation freak.
L:  Ah.
R:  Like the Sims and Sim City and Civilization and all those fun types of stuff.  I'm -- I'm actually sitting here playing Sim Three right now.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I bought it for my birthday.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so how -- how long have you been doing this?
R:  Oh, for years.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  It's really quite pathetic.
L:  See, I -- I don't play them at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- I don't have Internet -- Internet access at this point --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, you know, at home.  I do work on a computer all day long --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I've played, uh, a few -- very few games on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my own time, like at lunch or something.  But, um, usually I don't.
R:  See, I'm fairly young.  I'm -- I'm only twenty three so I kinda grew ...
L:  Okay.  I kinda thought so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I grew up in a generation where that's all we do.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.  I understand that because my son just absolutely loves those kinda games.  He's into the, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, gosh, now I've forgotten the name of it.  Um, you know --
R:  Is it ...?
L:  -- they have like their own whole little world.
R:  Yeah.  The Sims.
L:  Is -- is it the Sims?  I -- that didn't sound familiar to me.
R:  Yeah.  Where they -- where he designs the people and tells them what to do and go to the bathroom and builds their houses and that kinda stuff?
L:  Well, uh, this is like, um, more or less like in m- medieval times.  Is that the same?
R:  Um, there's another one that's kinda the same thing.  It's -- it's this -- it's this type of game that I play.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's what's called the Simulation Game.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, yeah, that's -- those are my ...  I don't like the shoot 'em up games.  My brain just doesn't function that way.
L:  Oh, like violence or something like that?
R:  Yeah.  Only my brain just doesn't work that way, like I'm not quick enough.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I love, uh, organizing the -- city planners and those kinda games.
L:  Wow!  So --
R:  But ... 
L:  -- does that correlate with what you do as an occ- -- in, uh, your occupation?
R:  Nope.  I'm just a Mom.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  So, this is just kind of a relief --
R:  This is my --
L:  -- relieve the stress of, uh ...
R:  -- from -- from nine until bedtime, from the time the kids go to bed --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to the time I go to bed this is what I do for me time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never -- I have never had the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I guess the real desire to do that sorta thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But as you had indicated, you know, you grew up in that generation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whereas I didn't.
R:  Yeah.  I've been playing -- I mean, my house has had Internet access since I was like eight or nine --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- like back when it was just primitive message boards and that's about it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, I've had it my entire life.  I don't know anything but it, you know?  And we had a Super Nintendo, a Nintendo and a -- you know, and a Playstation and you name it we've pretty much have had it growing up.  So ...
L:  Uh-huh.  But, you know, it's really funny because I've never really thought of it that way and I -- I always thought why does some of the, you know, younger generation why are they always playing these games?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you're right, it's because you haven't known anything different --
R:  Yeah.  Well, especially --
L:  -- anything other than ...
R:  -- like -- like I know with my Dad when my Dad was little he, you know, played marbles or played, you know --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- traded baseball cards and that kinda stuff and stuff I'd never even like thought of doing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Like, the idea of doing that that's like you're weird.  But it's definitely as -- 'cause my little boy is two and as he starts to get bigger and we're cognizant of the things around him and I've definitely -- me and my husband have talked about how we're gonna limit the amount of time that, you know -- so there's so many fat kids that are out there 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all they do is play video games --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they don't get outside, they don't ride bikes, they don't -- you know, don't ...
L:  Well, if -- yeah, I kinda hear a concern about it so that -- that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's not [inaudible] or all -- all one way.
R:  No.  I definitely think -- I mean, we recently moved 'cause my husband's going to school.  So, we're staying with my parents right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're just so nice 'cause they have a trampoline, a fort and a hot tub and a big yard and --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- it's so nice.  I swear my son's lost like six pounds in the last two months we've lived here just 'cause he's just playing --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- all day long from start -- you know?  And it makes me happy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It makes me happy he's just not sitting there watching T.V. or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  So, it's definitely something that my -- my husband and I have talked about how much time is to be allocated to the playing of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- video games and Internet and such.
L:  That's kinda equivalent to, you know, T.V. as well.
R:  Yep.  Yep.
L:  So, um, I guess it goes hand in hand.
R:  We watch the Wiggles every morning and that's about as much T.V. as he gets every day [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's just because Mom's not quite awake yet.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I have halfway snooze on the couch while he watches the Wiggles.
L:  Right.
R:  It works great.
L:  So, you -- you have just the -- the one child then?
R:  I have a two year old and a three month old.
L:  Okay.  So, the two year old is the oldest?
R:  Yep.
L:  So, he -- he's not quite into this -- the computers yet?
R:  No.  Well, he likes to sit on our lap and we go to Sesame Street dot com and he loves to play the games on there.
L:  Ah.  So, you are familiarizing him with it already?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yep.  He knows there's a game on there where it's got Elmo and the other one's name -- oh, I don't know -- Elmo and his little friend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you hit any key and they play peek a boo with you --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and we just sit him down -- if we let him we let him sit in that chair and he'd play it for like twenty minutes and just get so excited 'cause, you know, he just has to hit any key on the keyboard and they go peek a boo and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We only take like ...
L:  It's -- it's such a different world for little ones now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's totally unbelievable.
R:  Well, just the things that they'll know -- never know anything but, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  It's the same thing, like right now I -- my Mom's trying to empty out some of her stuff in her house 'cause they have so much stuff and she's like, "Well, I've have a yard sale".  I'm like why do a yard sale?  Just sell it on eBay --
L:  Ah.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know?  And me and my sister that's the first thing we think of, oh, just look on eBay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sell it on eBay and she's like, "Oh, I guess I could do that".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  I mean, I didn't necessarily grow up with computers, but when I was out in the working world then that's when I first became exposed to them and not -- I -- I mean, I -- I grew up in a generation where you really didn't have computers and then came word processing first --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, before, uh -- actually everyone had a regular P.C. on their desk --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you know, that -- I kind of grew into that generation.  But you're right, I mean, there's so many things that you can do and there's so much at -- you know, access at the tip of your fingers --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and it's great.  And then I have a hard time when I talk to someone who is not, um -- not -- not, uh -- only, um -- not proficient on -- on a P.C. --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yep.
L:  -- but not even really interested.
R:  Yep.
L:  Uh, I mean, you still come across a lot of people who are that way.
R:  My Dad's that way.
L:  Yeah.  And I'm just going, you know, to be in this world, to be in this generation you've got to have --
R:  You really do.  Yep.
L:  -- some sort of interest or, um, at least be able to be there with it or something.
R:  Yep.  My Dad can check his email because my Mom's got it set up.  So, all he has to do is hit like --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Hit a button.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- one button and it --
L:  I know.
R:  -- takes it right to him [LAUGH], whereas my Mom's a technology coordinator for her school district.
L:  Oh, so that makes a big deal of difference.
R:  So, she's like this huge +techie and my Dad's completely computer illiterate, like --
L:  Wow!  What an extreme opposite, huh?
R:  -- it's hilarious how computer illiterate he is.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, I'm not super +techie, I can check my email and play my games and that's about as much as I want to know, it's about as much as I have time for.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But my husband's a computer nerd.  So ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you kinda get that from him a little bit, huh?
R:  Yeah.  He's usually on the computer anyway.  So, I don't have time to go play on it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  He hogs it.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And I can't play them 'cause he's a graphic designer.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, we own a Macintosh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, so he's always working or doing homework or whatever on it.  So, I get it when he's off doing something else, you know?
L:  Now, have you had any other experience on just regular PCs --
R:  Yeah.  My -- my ...
L:  -- like I.B.M.?
R:  It's really sick actually.  Right now in our family's living room --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause my sister's at home for the summer from college and she has her computer and then we have our computer and then my Mom has her computer.  So, we have like four computers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all set up in a row in our living room.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's nothing unusual.  My son is kinda a computer nerd as well and he was with this group or with this family and they were running an Internet business --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and so they had -- and plus -- plus this -- this -- this game I was telling you about, but I can't remember the name of the game.  Anyway, they had like eleven computers set up.
R:  Wow!
L:  I mean, it was a computer bank in the living room.  It was just absolutely incredible.  [LAUGH]
R:  See, I thought our house with five computers was bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  So, I -- I know what you're -- what you're trying to describe there.  It's ...
R:  It is.  It really is.  They're all just set up in their own little row and, you know, we're worried about blowing the circuits 'cause we have so much --
L:  Right.
R:  -- electricity plugged up to the same thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But ...
L:  Yeah.  He was in this for about a year and a half and they -- they ran two separate businesses --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and one 'em was just, uh, selling retail on the Internet, just --
