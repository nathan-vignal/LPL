R:  Hello, [inaudible].
L:  Hi, how are you?  My name's Cindy.
R:  Hi, Cindy.  This is [inaudible].
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] Um, this is not a really hard one for me.  I don't play video games at all.
R:  Oh, that's funny.  I don't really, either.  I play, ah, solitaire --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- and Snoop.  So -- yeah.
L:  Oh, do you? [LAUGH].  Yeah, I've got three sons.  Two are teenagers, and they -- they like some video games, but not on the computer.
R:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
L:  Yes.  They -- they like the -- like, the Game Boy games, and stuff like that, but I don't let 'em -- I don't like 'em to be --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- on the computer at all, anyway.
R:  Um, the -- now, do you ever play like, Solitaire on computer?  Or --
L:  Um, I think the only thing I've ever even tried on the computer was, um -- what is that Bingo thing?
R:  Hm.  Ah --
L:  Slingo?  Or something?
R:  I'm not familiar with that one.
L:  I think it's called Slingo.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or s- -- [LAUGH] something like that.  It -- I think it's kinda like Bingo, but it's been so long since I played it, and that's when the first --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- time I ever even saw that games were on --
R:  Oh, I see, okay.
L:  -- online.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That you don't pay for.
R:  I've seen those on like, Yahoo.  Like, they'll have a little thing --
L:  Yeah, it's the free ones.
R:  -- that says, um, just click here to play different games.  Yeah?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ok- --
L:  Yeah.  And of course, we're -- we're on America Online.  So, yeah, and I don't -- I don't know.  I -- I guess it's also because when you get on there --
R:  Oh, I see [LAUGH].
L:  -- ah, people want to pop up and have a conversation with you online.
R:  You never know who you're talking to.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't like that [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  My son only did that one time.
R:  Sure.
L:  He played some kind of pool game, on -- like, you play -- play pool or something like that online.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And, um, somebody popped up.  He goes, "Mom, somebody popped up and they want to talk to me". 
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  And I said, "Get off the computer.  Get off" -- [LAUGH].  And he says, "Wait, Mom, look at his screen name".  And, ah --
R:  That would have made sure it wasn't somebody, yeah.
L:  -- and [inaudible].  And so he started talking to -- I was standing over his shoulder, watching him, you know.  He started talking to him, and it w- -- it -- it was lucky, 'cause it was another young man, that also wants to go --
R:  Good [LAUGH].
L:  -- to Seminary, so they -- they had a few minutes conversation about that and then I said, "Okay, it's time.  You can cut it off now".  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, sure.  You ever -- did you ever play a game, ah, Tetris, or did you ever hear of it?
L:  Yeah, they make me too nervous.  I don't like that.
R:  Okay.  Has -- [inaudible].
L:  I did when, ah --
R:  Yup.
L:  -- before home computers came out.
R:  Sure, yup.
L:  Back when they had like, the Atari, or --
R:  Yup.  Um, 'cause that's what [inaudible] like.  It -- it -- the game that has like --
L:  -- you know, Tet- -- you know, when, um, I guess it was Atari.  When it first came out, and you -- you -- you stuck it on your TV screen, or something.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  It had, ah, it's got like, these monsters and they have to stack 'em before they all come down [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.  If I ever played anything it would be like, Tetris, or the Pacman, or, you know, something like that [LAUGH].
R:  My cousin had that on the computer, and I kinda got bored.  That's the only reason I really played that.  It was kind of addicting, though.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I think those -- yeah, there's -- there's one other.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I don't remember what you call it, though.  But it's -- it's like a -- a caterpillar, and you gain or lose body circles.  Or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I -- that one -- I don't remember exactly how to play it, though.  Like I said, it's been so long.  I haven't even played on a computer game since years [LAUGH].  I just don't like 'em [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I guess one of the things that's tough is like, when I had the computer and I'm waiting for it connect to the internet, or something like that.  I'll just play solitaire, 'cause it's just right there, and it's -- it's like, I keep having this thing that I can do games for now, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- yeah, I -- I've seen it.  I've -- my brother plays it all the time.  But I -- I've seen it over his shoulder, you know, if I'm sitting in the room, whenever I go back home and visit, I'd see him sitting there playing it.
R:  You know, ah -- we -- is it just -- just for games that are online?  Or is it j- -- or is it just for computer games?  Okay.
L:  But I've never played online.  I just get out a deck of cards [LAUGH].
R:  [inaudible] Yeah.  Okay.
L:  It said video games.  So I don't know, you know -- and which ones do you play.  But --
R:  Okay.  
L:  You know, like I say, my -- my sons, all three, play some -- some degree of video games.  But they don't play 'em on -- on the computer.  They play, ah, Game Boy Advanced, or, ah, Playstation, things like that.
R:  Yeah, my -- my cousins have just got an X from [inaudible] and they had, ah, what did they have?  They had, you know, Lord of the Rings, and the new game.  I don't know if -- if it was played edition, or s- -- or, you know, w- which one of those it was.  But, um, it was a really, really -- the graphics were incredible.  It was just so lifelike.  And, ah, it was cool, too, because it was about Lord of the Rings, which, you know, is kind of, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I guess, great -- considered great literature, you know [LAUGH].  Classic literature.
L:  Well --
R:  But it wasn't just, you know, mindless I guess [LAUGH].  We were some of the characters that fit into the story and, you know, stuff like that.
L:  Right [LAUGH], yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  I'd like to see, um, I -- I mean, I know this wouldn't be big in the --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- the normal market.  But I'd like to see, um, Christian video games --
R:  Yeah, s- sure.
L:  -- 'cause that's pretty much an untapped market, you know?
R:  Yup, yeah.
L:  And there are a lot of parents, like me, who are so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- careful about what their kids are allowed to watch and do.
R:  Have like, Jesus and the twelve apostles, you know?  [LAUGH].
L:  That, you know, that'd be a big market for the Christian society, anyway.  They'd sell like crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, I'd like to see something geared in that direction.
R:  Sure.
L:  But --
R:  As like a -- kind of like a learning tool, that would be fun too.
L:  Something that -- that, you know --
R:  [NOISE].
L:  -- ah, bible facts, or trivia, or something.  If you -- if you predict the outcome correctly, you know?  [LAUGH] Because you know the story or something.  I don't know how they'd do it.  But -- yeah, that'd be fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That'd be sort of fun.  Because, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's why I think my husband doesn't like the kids -- he doesn't like to actually see 'em, you know -- really, he doesn't like --
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- video games at all [LAUGH].  He says, "They're mindless.  They're stupid".  They're supposed to be entertainment.
R:  I see, I see.
L:  They're not supposed to be learning anything, when they're doing that.  "Well, then it's a waste of time".  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  He says, if they're not learning something, doing it, then they ought not to be doing it.  So, the kids just sort of don't bring out --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- the video games around Dad, 'cause [LAUGH] -- it's like "Mom, I'm gonna go in my room and, ah, you know, play for a while".  [LAUGH].
R:  That's [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  My husband says, that's fine.  I says, 'cause I didn't hear the words video game [LAUGH].  He allows himself to be deluded [LAUGH]. It's so weird.
R:  Hm.
L:  We're a weird family, anyway [LAUGH].  But I got three of 'em, and -- and, ah, the youngest one is ten.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And the oldest one is fifteen.  And I still won't let 'em have anything that's, ah --
R:  I see.
L:  -- not really decent.  You know?  And I know some of the most exciting games are the ones that I won't let my h- -- kids have, anyway.
R:  Hm.
L:  'Cause, you know, I hear kids talking about this exciting game, and the [inaudible] and the graphics are great, and all of this stuff, but, you know, they've even got these --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- video games that have cursing words in 'em, and I don't know why, because they're supposed to be making 'em for children.
R:  Well, I guess that's definitely a market that they need to -- to open up, because I'm sure that there are a lot of people in your --
L:  So --
R:  -- your similar situation that would be -- you would rush out to the stores and but 'em if -- if they were -- the graphics were good, and it were, you know, either, not -- non violent or they had, um -- yeah.
L:  I don't know, I don't [LAUGH] -- I -- I kinda wish that I enjoyed 'em, 'cause they're entertaining.  They look like they're a lot of fun to the kids, but I've just never been able to, you know, do it.  It gets boring, to me.
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, you know, like, the same thing with Christian videos.  And they could do a video game the same way.  They may only appeal to a small --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- market, but they can -- bam, that m- market just grabs it.  You know?  So, I don't -- um, trying to think if there's any -- I don't think there's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- any other video games [LAUGH].  This is such a bad question --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- for me [LAUGH].  I don't think there are any other I've even tried.
R:  Oh Free Cell.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, my mom --
L:  Oh, there's that one online, but I don't understand how -- I've tried it, and I have no idea how to play 'em.  Never figured it out.  Um, it's one of those that automatically comes with your computer.  Ah, where solitaire is.  And like, red cell, or something like that?  Free Cell, yeah.
R:  Actually it was funny, 'cause I was looking at that, um, [inaudible] mom explained it to me.  It's kind of the same thing as solitaire, you try to build all the cards in like, sequential order.  Um, but what was the catch?  It was -- you -- you built -- you have to build the cards, but you only have so many like, free spaces.  'Cause there's like, four spaces on each side.  On one side you have to build 'em up like, all your, um, you know, all your clubs.  You have to build up like, you know, ace, one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or -- or ace, two, three, four, five, you know, and so on and so on.  All the way up to -- all the way up through.  On the other side, you have four free spaces.  And you can put any card you want there, but you're gonna have to --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- get -- like, all the cards are just out there in front of you, and you kinda have to build 'em all [inaudible] in there.  And it's kinda like --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, see, I guess those -- a- and I -- I wouldn't of either --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- unless [inaudible] had explained it to me.  But, I think -- I think a lot of those games are kinda like --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- and I know you got like, gin and rummy, and -- 
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and whatever else on- online --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, or -- they -- they just, you know, then it's real card games, you know, so --
L:  I guess I'm not game savvy [LAUGH].  I just couldn't figure it out.  And [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I see, I see.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Not [LAUGH].
L:  Maybe that's what it is.  Maybe it's a sort of -- it's generational maybe.  You know, you get a certain mindset and, you know, these games will make fun, or it makes sense to you on a card game, but they don't make sense -- the same exact game doesn't make sense online.
R:  Well, I don't -- I don't really think it's 'cause -- I mean, you know, video games were really popular in the eighties, and that's when, you know, you would have been -- yeah.  Yup.
L:  So maybe it's just a generation thing.  Maybe I'm out of it [LAUGH].  I'm forty one --
R:  O- okay.
L:  -- so I guess I'm -- I'm just way too old to get it.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, the eighties -- it was pretty much, um, at the arcade.  You know?  'Cause personal computers didn't even --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- come out until the year my first son was born [LAUGH].  That was eighty eight.  I think it was eighty eight they came out.  To where people really started having 'em in their house, even.
R:  Yeah.  They just get used to -- yeah.
L:  And, ah, even then, most people didn't.  They didn't have 'em, because, um, I'd heard about 'em, but I did -- I didn't know anybody that had one, until years later.  So, I don't know.  I -- I just -- I think that, um, maybe it's because the kids nowadays have seen 'em --
R:  I see, I see.  Yup.
L:  -- in their house, for years.  You know, my son's -- my oldest one's fifteen and --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- like I said, that's when they first really came was -- was the year he was born.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  So, by the time he was, ah, five, six, seven years old, he was used to seeing PCs and video games.
R:  Huh.
L:  And so, for him, it's always been there.  But I guess -- maybe someday they'll come up with one and I'm get it.  Maybe that's it.  If I got it [LAUGH] -- if I understood it well enough, I'd probably enjoy it more [LAUGH].  But I still think, for my husband, if it didn't teach him something while he was playing it, he wouldn't pl- -- he would never play it [LAUGH].
