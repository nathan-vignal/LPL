R:  Hi, this is Michelle.
L:  Hi, this is Laurie.  [MN] 
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.  I'm trying to remember the last movie I went to see, and it wasn't that long ago and I can't remember it [LAUGH] and I'm --
L:  I know, I'm the same way.
R:  -- I'm thinking, "I hate when they give you these ...", you know, think, think, think, quick, think quick.  [LAUGH]
L:  Multi, multi, um --
R:  Oh, I don't know if I love to go to the movies or stay home.  I love both probably, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every once in a while I want to go to the movies, you know, I just want to get out there, especially if it's a -- a, you know, a really good movie that I don't want to wait 'til it comes --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- 'til it comes out on, ah, you know, tape or DVD, or which ever way you wanna, um, you know, watch it.
L:  Um, let's see, I like -- I like to go to the theaters when it's a movie that you can't see on -- y- you can't appreciate on t- -- a television screen.
R:  Right, like --
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  -- Titanic.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like Titanic or S- -- um, Star Wars, or I think the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- last movie we saw -- my husband and I saw at the, um, theater together was, um, The Lord of the Rings part two.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  Kind of thing, I --
R:  -- yeah, I didn't see that.
L:  Um, he's gone a couple of times on his own.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, we've been to -- we have a drive in -- I live in Ocala, Florida and we have a drive in theater --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- here and we --
R:  Yeah, we have -- well, we still have one too so that's pretty neat.
L:  Yeah, those are kind of fun, th- they would double feature --
R:  Right.
L:  -- here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where we live but -- and then other times we just, um -- we usually wait for the movies to get on to the dollar shelf before we rent --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- them or the -- the cheaper shelf.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  And, um --
R:  And then I look for the three day rental rather than two day rental [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or the one day, you know, because you just don't have enough time to always watch it and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you don't always feel like going back, I think that's my biggest problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- returning the video.  [LAUGH]
L:  Returning the films, and we --
R:  It would be nice if it was on the way --
L:  Yeah, we --
R:  -- to work or on the way home or [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, that it was something you could do but.
L:  We used to have a video store that was convenient --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, for both of us, but now that they're kind of out of the way for m- -- for both of us --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- w- -- the way we drive.  Um, we found that we -- we return them, the videos, late --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so often that it would probably be cheaper to just --
R:  To -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- order one from -- we have like the dish -- satellite dish --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and you can order where like one movie is like four dollars, or four or five dollars I think.
R:  Yeah, we have basic cable, so we get -- we're lucky we get the news, you know?
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, we don't really watch too much TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was just remembering that the last movie I -- we saw was, um, [LIPSMACK] Anger Management.
L:  Oh.
R:  My husband insisted on seeing that movie and then it turned out that it wasn't that good.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was --
L:  A -- a lot of his movies are much better in -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in preview form.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, he thought that, ah, you know, it would be a good movie and it would be a good choice and it was his choice so, I said, "Okay, whatever".  I would -- probably would have picked something else but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, he, ah --
L:  It --
R:  we did it and then, you know, after you spend the money and you go and you're like, "Oh, man".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Something we should have maybe rented and then we could have been a little bit less disappointed [LAUGH] than --
L:  Exactly
R:  -- by spending the money but --
L:  Um.
R:  -- yeah, that was his choice.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's, ah -- I -- I always find we usually take turns, um, doing the, ah -- the picking the movies but there's some that -- that I'll usually get to -- he'll go to with me willingly if it has Sandra Bullock or, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Charlie's Angels or [LAUGH] --
L:  Actually, I -- I want to see the -- I didn't see the first one, he did --
R:  Oh, do you?  Nah.
L:  -- but I'd -- I'd like to see this [inaudible] I want to see how much of a parody it is as opposed to --
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I don't think I saw -- saw the first one so --
L:  Some of the previews that I've seen have just been -- I -- I -- I've laughed, he hasn't laughed but I've laughed [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so I want to see how much of a -- 'cause apparently they parody a lot of, um, different movies --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- inside of it and then I like -- I like Bernie Mac --
R:  Oh yes.
L:  -- the guy who's playing Bosley so.
R:  Yeah, he's funny, yeah he's -- he's -- I enjoy him, you know, his --
L:  Yeah, I've actually watched his, um, sit com a couple of times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The only one that I watched on that station.
R:  Yeah, that comes on basic cable but I don't really -- I don't know, I must watch it -- I wa- -- I see it when I flip through the channels but -- and I've seen it maybe once or twice but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] I don't -- it's not something I pick but [NOISE] --
L:  So where do you live [NOISE]?
R:  In Pennsylvania.
L:  Wow.
R:  And you're in where, California?
L:  Ocala, Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so we're --
R:  Oh, Florida.
L:  -- same coast.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how much do movies cost up there to -- to go to?
R:  Um, usually, um, let's see, around eight, nine dollars.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  They're, um -- when we lived in Gainesville in, um, which is a little north of where we are now, um, it was, I think you'd get a matinee for three seventy five --
R:  Oh, yeah, cheaper during the afternoon, yeah.
L:  -- um, and evenings were four seventy five.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um.
R:  Wow.
L:  Here in Ocala it's about six dollars --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- at the -- at the theater.
R:  That su- surprises me that Florida would be cheaper than --
L:  Well, the big cities aren't --
R:  -- Pennsylvania.  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and Ocala's not a big city, it's -- it was about --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- nine dollars when I, um, [LIPSMACK] went down in, ah, Hollywood, Florida --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- which is down Fort Lauderdale area --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, yeah.
R:  Well it's -- you know, we don't live near a big -- we don't live in a big city, but we live near a big city and that's where we -- we have to go to the movies 'cause our city doesn't have a movie theater at all.  Doesn't --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- doesn't have any [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but we're only, I don't know, a half hour from the movie theater, so it's not too far.
L:  Do you have kids too?
R:  Well, they're grown.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Yeah, so I have g- -- a grandson --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's what I buy most of my videos for, for him.
L:  For the -- yeah.
R:  You know, like, ah, Pixar and, um, Monsters Incorporated, those -- they're the ones that Pixar makes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And Finding Nemo.  Did you see that one?
L:  Haven't seen it yet.  It's in --
R:  Okay, well he -- he saw it and I wanted to go but, ah, I wasn't able to go with him.  He's seven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but he said, "That's definitely one we want to buy on tape".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I've -- I've heard just a lot of good reviews of it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so, I actually do want to -- I like watching mo- -- kids movies.  I teach elementary school and so, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I buy some of the ones and, you know, sneak them in if the -- if the principal allows but you've got to, even -- even there, with -- with some of the cartoons you gotta really, really watch them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- before you can even bring them in the class room because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- even though they're G or, ah -- you're not allowed to show PG --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and even the G ones sometimes there's some --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- stuff in there that [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I know.  Some of the things that the seven year olds understand and I don't . [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like we have -- a friend of ours gave us the movie Shrek --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, um, w- we both love it but I don't know if I would -- I don't know if the stuff in there would go over the head of a kid or -- or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, some of the jokes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that are in there.
R:  Yeah, we have that on tape too.
L:  But, um.
R:  I never even, I -- when my kids were little I didn't -- we didn't really buy a whole lot of movies, but now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it just seems like, you know, we should have some of these, you know, on tape for future grandchildren I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean it's the --
R:  'Cause they're good, you know, they're good movies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What grade do you teach?
L:  Um, I've taught mostly second and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- we just moved to Ocala last year, so I haven't taught here in Ocala.  I taught in Alachua county before that.
R:  Oh, okay, 'cause that's the grade my grandson will be going to.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  He's a good, smart kid so it makes me happy.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- it probably makes it --
R:  He's respectful.
L:  -- probably makes the teacher happy too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, kindergarten and first grade, we've gotten good reviews about him being respectful and that's --
L:  That's --
R:  -- important.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's half the battle nowadays I -- I think.
R:  Yes.  Yeah, because she said, "You just wouldn't believe ..." --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I said, "Well, I can imagine".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it only gets -- only going to get worse instead of better.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, yeah.  Yeah, d- -- you have to think about, you know, the G rating like you said as far as whether it's good for little kids or not 'cause --
L:  Well, some of the PG thirteen movies, you know, I'm -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm pretty shocked --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, yeah.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And, um, so that's a- another reason we don't always g- g- go to a movie because sometimes we don't m- -- you know, just like it's too gratuitous.  Like there are a few movies out there that I wouldn't go to see like those Fast and Furious movies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you couldn't pay me to go see them.
R:  Yeah, or like The Matrix, did you see that?  Only, I did --
L:  My husband did, went to see it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I just don't think -- I don't know -- you know, I just don't, you know, I don't like, you know, if it says like Arnold Schwarzenegger or, um, I don't know, ah, Demi Moore's ex husband, I forget his name --
L:  Bruce Willis.
R:  -- yeah, Bruce --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, it's like, ah, "I don't know", [LAUGH] I mean, "I'll just skip that".  I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know, I just don't like the, you know -- and kids love that stuff, you know, and they're not old enough to get it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know what I mean, just like video games.  They're just not old enough to understand the --
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- the violence.
L:  -- violence back when, you know, when I was growing up was like y- you know, you hear a gun shot and then you, um, see the ambulance picking the guy up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you don't see the bullet going into the person and blood splattering all over the place and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yet I mean it's [LAUGH] --
R:  Scary.
L:  -- way -- way -- way too -- too graphic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nowadays and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't have my own kids --
