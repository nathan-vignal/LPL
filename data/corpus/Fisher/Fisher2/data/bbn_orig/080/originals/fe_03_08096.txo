L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Katherine.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] I'm Katherine.
R:  Katherine?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi.  My name's Renee.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Where --
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I'm in Michigan.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Washington DC.
R:  Okay.  Do you have any hobbies?
L:  Um, yeah.  I don't really know what the definition of [LAUGH] hobbies is.  I mean, I --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I do a lot of things that I wish were my job that are my hobbies I guess [LAUGH] right now.  I just graduated in art in December.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I do a lot of artwork but, unfortunately, it's mostly a side thing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- right now.  So, what -- do you do any hobbies?
R:  Um, I sew.  I used to, um, do a lotta sewing.  Um, my mom and I both did.  We each did different items and had different stuff but [NOISE] we used to, um [LIPSMACK] -- oh, it was probably six years we sewed and we did craft shows.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  During the summertime and that and --
L:  I love to sew.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I -- I don't sew much clothes wise but -- because I just -- I don't do well with patterns [LAUGH] and that but I --
L:  Yeah.  I never use a pattern so sometimes the things I come up with don't quite --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- fit the person they're made for. [LAUGH] But --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I b- -- I bought a brand -- about seven years ago I bought a brand new, um, machine and n- -- a surger so I use those a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I've also -- I haven't got much into scrap booking.  Um, I have a lot of the stuff sitting here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it seems that I never have time to do it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, and I have two children -- I have a boy that's nine and a -- a girl that's seven.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  And unfortunately, [LAUGH] I don't --
L:  That takes up a lotta [LAUGH] time.
R:  I don't have much, um, of their scrapbooks done but I just got into stamping.  Um, so --
L:  What is that?
R:  Stamping with -- you know, making cards.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yep.  And so, I've been doing that and, um -- and then I've also got into beading so I've been making a lotta jewelry.
L:  Wow.  So, you've tons of hobbies. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, I work part time.  I have my own vending business --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and then I'm home with the kids the rest of the time and -- and I coupon and rebate and -- and that's another big hobby of mine -- couponing and rebating because without that I would have to work full time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, my -- all my friends call me the coupon diva.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  I'm so unorganized with that.  I tried to do that for a while.  It -- I was -- I'm always picking up things and then finding out I don't have time to do everything, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have -- I mean, I garden, I have a dog, I have a -- trying to set up a printing business in -- it's in my shed, so I do some printing too, which is, kind of, like stamping I guess.  Um --
R:  Now, you do that, like, on a computer then?
L:  No.  On, um -- um, t-shirts.  I have a t-shirt printing press --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- a six color press.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, I've gotten a couple of jobs but I'm still figuring out the equipment.  It's actually -- someone said I could -- if I stored it for them then I could use it to get jobs so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I have a n- neat arrangement 'cause it's, like, a really expensive piece of equipment but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I have it for free right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  So, I'm just trying to -- I don't know.  And I paint -- I was painting when they called.  Um, [LAUGH] I do -- I don't know.  I do a lot of things but, um, I wish they were my real jobs so hopefully, someday, they will [LAUGH] be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I, kinda, look at my hobbies as part of my job because, I mean, you know, I spend [COUGH] twenty or thirty dollars on a stamp set, you know, and then I really can't justify going and buying cards.
L:  Right.
R:  But I can go buy, you know, twenty dollars worth of paper and I can make cards for the --
L:  Hundreds.
R:  -- next two years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Tons of 'em.
L:  And give them away as presents and that --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- saves you money.
R:  Yeah.  And I do that too with, um -- well, I made jewelry, um, earrings and bracelets for my -- each of my kids' teachers this year for the year end.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  And then, um, I made, um, a pen.  I used [NOISE] double stick t- tape.  You have to u- -- you can't do a pen that you push down on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- well, I suppose you could but I did the one that has, like, the cap you pull the top off.
L:  Right.
R:  I did double stick tape on it [NOISE] and then so it would stick -- it stuck to the pen and then the other side was sticky and then I put on, [NOISE] ah, wrapping paper over it, cut it to fit --
L:  Oh, how cute.
R:  -- and then I put double stick tape on again and I rolled it in these teeny tiny little beads that don't even have holes in 'em and they were just beautiful pens.  So, I did pens and, like, four --
L:  And then did you varnish them or did they just stay just a- -- like that?
R:  No, they just -- they were on that double stick tape.  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  You just, kind of, roll them with your hands and get 'em to stick on there.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  And, um -- and then I did, like, four note cards and put 'em in a little holder and so I did that for, like, the music teacher, the art teacher, the gym teacher, the secretaries and --
L:  That's so nice.  My mother teaches.  I was thinking about teaching actually -- that's the other thing I'm pursuing right now.  I'm gonna go back and get my Masters in Education I think.
R:  Oh, good for you.  Do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I wish I would've.  I have a business degree and I wish I could be home with my kids.  You know, I mean, I -- I am but, you know, I don't have a full time income either.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So --
L:  It's such a trade off.  It's such a trade off.  That's what they don't teach you, like, when you're little and, you know, y- you learn all the things about --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, gun ho, go out and start your own business.  All this different stuff but it's, like -- it's such a trade off.  It's either, you know -- it's --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you want your business to be your life or your family to be your life?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or --
R:  And my family definitely is.  You know, we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- garden -- we garden and, you know, we -- I can tomatoes and we make our own jam and jelly and --
L:  That's cool.
R:  You know, there's a lot of -- a lot of really neat things that I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- learned from my mom and -- and it's funny because I'm passing them on to my kids now -- as my hobbies they're becoming their hobbies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My son grows his own sugar peas and loves it.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  And they --
L:  Yeah, we have sugar peas.
R:  And he -- he has friends come over and they'll go -- he'll go, "Oh, come try my sugar peas" and they'll taste one bite and they'll say, "Yuck, that's --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- disgusting".  And he thinks they're like candy.  He just loves them.
L:  That's awesome.
R:  But he said that other day, "You know what?  I wanna teach my kids to make jam when I have kids 'cause this is the best jam in the world Mom". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I just, like, think if kids can grow something themselves they'll -- they'll eat so many [LAUGH] more vegetables.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They can watch it happening and take pride in it.
R:  Yep.  Yep.
L:  The little girls next door even -- I have a -- I have a big garden and they come over and help me.  I haven't had one in years 'cause I've been living in an apartment --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but now I live in a little house and, um, we have a garden out back and the little girls come over and help me and stuff and they'll eat all this stuff and their parents are, like, amazed because they'll never eat spinach --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- or anything --
R:  Well --
L:  -- on the dinner table [LAUGH] but then --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- they'll come into the garden and I'm, like, "Taste this.  Try this.  Try this" and --
R:  Yep.  They're more apt to them.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, one of the other questions they asked is do you think it's important to have a hobby?  I personally do.  When I first got married -- we've been married for thirteen years now -- I didn't have many hobbies and I was, like, suffocating my husband. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he had his workshop and his tools and he just loves to putter and tinker and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fix things and build things.  Um, then I started getting into my sewing and it was so nice because I would do my thing, he would do his thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think it -- I think it really is important to have --
L:  Broadens your --
R:  -- something.
L:  -- relationship.
R:  Yeah.  And have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something that you can just do in the meantime.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  No matter what it is.
L:  I feel the same way.  It's -- I -- when I -- when I know p- -- I know people who don't have anything that they're passionate about at all or anything that gives them, like, joy to make --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for themselves or -- or to see or to do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're just -- you know, they're just, like, wandering it seems like.  You know, I have all these friends and they're always out trying to find something to do, like, going to a bar or something like that but I have commitments to myself that I need paint, that I need to, you know, work on the printing press or work in the garden and stuff like that so it's -- you know, it makes me, I think, a much happier person --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- than them.
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, we have -- ah, well, a little better than a half acre where we live.  We live more of in a -- a -- a suburb --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  I mean, the yards are a pretty good size here and, um [COUGH] -- and that's something I take a real pride in is making my house look nice.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, I like --
L:  Me too.  I love decorating.
R:  I love to go on vacation, you know, and go away but I love [LAUGH] to be at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And to take care of my stuff and to have it look nice.
L:  Yeah.  My --
R:  I mean, I really pride myself on that.
L:  My boyfriend and my mom laugh at me so much 'cause every time he and I move somewhere I -- he s- -- he says that I just put the same rooms back together like in the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- new house, you know?  I -- I mean, we are living in rentals but I -- I paint everything, I put my curtains up, I put -- like, you know, I scrub the floors, I put down my carpets and everything and put up all the shelves and ev- -- and it just looks like I've moved the same room again.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it makes me feel like I'm home, you know?  No, when they're --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- these houses that aren't mine and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, unfamiliar places.  It's so important to me in, like, the first week that we move places I'm always --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- frantic to get it how I want it.
R:  Yeah.  And I think --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- a lot of people get a lot of, um -- I get a lot of -- I feel better about myself and a lot of self fulfillment to do it myself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, there's -- I'm --
L:  Definitely.
R:  I think we've hired someone to f- -- um, put new windows in when we lived at our old house and we had a farm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, we hired someone to put our windows in and then we hired someone to fix the washing machine once.  Other than that, I've never hired a fix it man.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My husband's my fix it man and that's his hobby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I mean, he'll put the brakes on the car, whatever and, you know, he loves just tinkering with that, kind of, stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Me too.  I have a huge tool shop whenev- -- and I love to make -- I -- I mean, the main thing I make is I make my -- my own, um, canvas structures and -- and boards to paint on and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I just love, like, sanding it and filing it and r- routing it and --
R:  Oh, sure.  And once it's all done, you know --
L:  It's, like, there's such pride I don't even wanna paint on it sometimes.  I [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  I already --
R:  Well --
L:  -- made this, why would I have to do anything else to it?
R:  And -- and we're just -- I mean, I love going to Lowe's and Home People and Renards[?] and checking out what the home projects are that they have going on there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're right in the ma- -- middle of, um -- we've been in our house for seven years and basically, when we moved in we just painted everything white and put carpet in.  Well, now -- and I was pregnant for my daughter then -- now she's seven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but we had hardwood floors we carpeted over and now we've taken the carpet up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we've cleaned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the floors, we've gone back to that.  And now we're, room by room, working through painting, adding color to the house.
L:  That's great.
R:  You know, and doing it yourself, my gosh, instead of hiring a painter, you know, we can do the whole house versus half the house if we --
L:  Being ab- able to afford one room.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
