L:  Hello.
R:  Hi --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- this is Paula.
L:  This is Nina.
R:  Hi Nina.
L:  I'm in Atlanta.
R:  You're in Atlanta?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm in Austin, Texas.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  So, do you play computer games?
R:  Actually I don't.  I used to, um, when they were first --
L:  Online.
R:  -- out.  Ah, yeah, like just Solitaire and Minesweeper.
L:  I play, um -- I'm on Yahoo a lot, but my computer doesn't do it now 'cause I have a Mac computer, but when I had a windows computer I did, um -- I played, let's see, Dominoes, um, some Soli- -- I play -- only play -- time I play Solitaire is when I, um, download it on my ga- -- I have a game for Solitaire.  And I play Pool, I love playing Pool a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially online, 'cause I like going on Yahoo 'cause you can talk and chitchat while you're playing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's much better, you don't have to be playing by yourself there.
R:  Yeah, I had a friend that did that a lot too.
L:  And then I have it on my computer too, where I can play with a local player if somebody has the same game that connect with me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or I could play it with the computer, which is not fun at all.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause the computer acts like it doesn't want to play.
R:  Yeah.  Do you ever win against the computer?
L:  Yeah, I always win.  It's just like I said, it acts like it doesn't want to play.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah, so it's, hm.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  It is pretty fun, ah, and I just like -- I wish the computer -- I wish I had a more advanced game because I -- like if I go out and play pool with somebody I don't want to play --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but if I get on the computer, I'll want to play because I think that -- I think the computer should be able to -- you know, to win, I don't know.  It does the same thing on my, ah, Playstation, the computer acts like it doesn't want to play right.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I stop playing against the computer, I play against --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- myself, it's a little bit better.  [LAUGH]
R:  My kids play -- we have, um, CD games -- 
L:  Cd-rom?
R:  -- that they play --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, um, they play Blues Clues and then, um, a couple of others that they really like and they're kind of like learning games, but, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] each of them you have to, um, enter the questions right and then you get --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the points, and then after you have the points it lets you go to this little shop and pick out something and, um, just on the computer anyway.
L:  [NOISE] That sounds fun.
R:  [NOISE] So, they like that, yeah.
L:  Another game the kids might like is, um, Carmen Sandiego.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I had that game.  I just got -- well, I used to love to watch the game on TV and then I watched it, um -- I used to play the video game, but I just got the first edition, so, I was trying to get all the editions, but I got the first one.  I love that game.  I love to get on there --
R:  Yeah, that does sound fun.
L:  -- I mean, it's real fun for me 'cause I -- I don't know half the questions.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah that does sound fun.  They have a couple of, um, [LIPSMACK] let me see, they have some other games like, um, J.J. is a airplane and it lets you --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, J.J. Jet?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  It lets you fly J.J. around and --
L:  Okay.  And, um, I like the game that, um, has the -- I play this on the internet too, the one that, um, the roller coaster game.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, that's real fun.  You can build your own roller coaster and make it how you --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- want so the whole entire theme park -- put what you want to put in so it -- it's [inaudible] fun, I enjoy playing that one.  Um, how old are your kids?
R:  They are -- I have twins that are four --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then, um, a baby that's two.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, they're still playing the little baby games, but I'm sure it won't be long and we'll have a Playstation and all --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that other stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we have both; we have Playstation one and two and I'm the only one who plays Playstation one, but we're expecting a little one, um, December sixteenth is our due date --
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  -- so -- thank you, I'm so happy, um --
R:  That'd be exciting.
L:  Yes, it's my first, so.
R:  Oh, yeah?  We -- we have a fourth one on the way, he'll be here, or, it will be here in September.
L:  Okay, you don't know what you're having?
R:  I don't, mhm.
L:  You don't want to know?
R:  No, I decided not to find out this time.
L:  What's the, ah, what's your due date?
R:  Um, September twenty second.
L:  That's funny, 'cause my boyfriends birthday is nineteenth and the baby that my c- -- my, well his cousin's baby is due on the same day as yours.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  My husband's birthday is, um, September eighteenth, so he wants me to have it --
L:  So, it's all in that little area.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I ca- -- I can't wait.  Ah, I'm trying to buy stuff now and they're like, no, you can't buy stuff yet, wait.
R:  [LAUGH] And do, ah, do you know what you're having? 
L:  No.  I want a girl, he wants a boy.
R:  [LAUGH] Are you gonna find out?
L:  Yes, in the four m- -- in four weeks.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  I'm going to find out.  Well, in three weeks, 'cause this is my seventeenth week, I'm going to find out in three weeks, to find out exactly what we're having.  I want, like I said, I want a girl, he wants a boy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'll be happy whatever god gives me, you know, as long as it's healthy but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I really, really want that girl [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  Guys always want a boy.
L:  -- Huh?
R:  Guys always want a boy.
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  It's like, "I want you to be named after me", no, your name's common, we don't do common names.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I came up with a nice name, he tell me the name sounds gay.  I was like, "No, it doesn't".  He was, um, Kemani[?] Eshan[?] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he said that sounds gay, so.
R:  That's so hard to -- my husband and I couldn't agree on any of the names, we had a hard time.
L:  You did?  Why didn't you just name them after him?
R:  Well, we had the twins first.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And they're both boys and so, um --
L:  One has his name.
R:  Yeah, so.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then, um --
L:  Well, then.  [SIGH]
R:  -- we did middle names and stuff so.
L:  I'm trying to find a book, but it's hard.  I can't -- I want to find a book with the meanings.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't want to just name him like, okay, cow, but we don't know what cow means [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that's why I haven't really bought any, um --
R:  I think there's a website that's baby namer dot com.
L:  Yes, but my computer's really messed up.  It's, ah -- it's slow.  I have a Mac --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my computer jump -- it'd take me off the internet and -- and everything.  I just got it where it won't kick me off.  Like if I have a phone call coming in, it'd kick me off.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Now I have a, um -- a call alert on my phone to tell me when I'm having a call come in and, um, it's a little green and blue box telling me who's calling and then it takes a message for me and I'll listen to it on the internet.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Yeah, then you can decide to answer or not.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  And, ah, most of the time I d- don't, since it's not anybody important I will call you back when I get off line.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah, I fi- --
R:  We got a cable modem --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- runs through, um, same connection as the television cable --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so that's helped a lot because with the dial up modem, like you said, every time somebody would call you get kicked off or if you switched it the other way, nobody could ever get through 'cause it was always busy.
L:  Exactly, so you -- you're always ending some -- ah, missing messages so --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I -- I can't afford that so I decided just to get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the call alert so I can just see who's calling and that way, you know, vice versa, um, we, um -- we're thinking about getting the cable -- the cable modem --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but we have direct TV and there's is ninety nine dollars almost --
R:  Oh, golly.
L:  -- and that -- that doesn't sound fun.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't got ninety nine dollars to give you every month plus my, ah, phone bill.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That -- and that -- that's too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we're going to get the cable modem and it's only twenty dollars a month -- have a special for three months for, ah, twenty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dollars each month.  [LIPSMACK] If I like it I'll keep it, if I don't then I'll cancel.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and we also have DSL in this area too.  Do you have that?
L:  Yes we do, that's the same thing as cable modem, DSL.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I really would think I want that but my -- like I said, my -- almost, if I get that is my laptop going to be compatible with it, 'cause like I say, I have a Mac --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I don't -- I don't -- I don't know anything about Macs and I'm -- I'm co- -- very computer literate, but not with Macs.  When it comes to those I'm just lost, but Windows --
R:  [NOISE] I know me, ah, me too.  [NOISE]
L:  -- but Windows, I can do all kind of things.  You just give me a Windows computer and I'll -- I'll tell you how to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- reprogramming, unprogramming and everything.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- that's us here too.
L:  And like, I like Windows computers because they ha- -- they come with games like the, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like they have Solitaire, Spider, different things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my computer has nothing.  You have to boot -- you have to boot up the, um -- you have to put on the, um -- the games itself, you can't --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- you can't just, "Oh, it's a game on here".  [NOISE] 
R:  Gotcha, you have to find them or do them on the internet like you --
L:  See, yeah.  So, you have to go -- you have to go -- that's more money you have to spend.
R:  Sure.
L:  So, I feel like it's cheaper.  But out here, we have a places that's, ah, they -- they'll build you a computer and, you know, it must cost like two hundred dollars.  I'm -- I'm thinking about doing that.
R:  That's cool.
L:  'Cause it'd be a Windows computer --
R:  Yeah, you'd be back to --
L:  -- and they give --
R:  -- a regular PC.
L:  Yeah, and that's what I need, I need a PC.  I cannot stay on a -- this -- this is not working for me at all.
R:  Yeah, I don't think I could go back to Mac after all this time --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- just wouldn't know what to do with it.
L:  I -- when I -- when I first moved in I [inaudible], I was like, "Dang, this is Mac".  I thought it was a Windows.  I didn't know it was any else, you know, different.  I didn't know -- never know the difference 'cause I was so used to using -- working with a Windows computer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then when I got I was like, "Okay, you have a Macintosh, so let's figure out how to use this", and then you -- you -- there's games you can download on to your computer and have it just there, but in the Macintosh, um, their website is so complicated that you're -- you're gonna be messed up.  Like I use AOL and it's hard to, um, go into other places because they want you to use your, um, Microsoft, you know to go into AOL.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Yeah, and it's -- I can't do that because i- i- it'll shut my computer down.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, I guess you can probably agree with, um, the fact that Microsoft is kind of becoming a monopoly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  I'm -- I'm really -- I wish they would just sort of stop making them and then when they do that, please give me another computer.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, but I'm probably going to just end up buying another one very soon 'cause I -- I can't deal with this.  It's just not working -- it's -- it's no- -- it's a was- -- I think it's just a waste of money.
R:  Right, that would be.
L:  I think Macs should just be used for people who are really into business wise, that's all they gonna use their computer for.
R:  Right.
L:  But.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, or they should specialize in something else.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  'Cause, you know, business computers, something, 'cause this -- this is not working.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, it's like, I wanted to buy a web cam for my computer -- like my parents, they have everything for their computer, they have a microphone, web cam, speakers.  We have speakers and a mouse [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and a web cam costs arm and a leg.  I don't --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- have, ah, it's like, you get the cheapest one for the web cam for my computer is ninety nine dollars.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [NOISE] --
