L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name's Rhonda.
L:  Hi, my name's Helena.  Where are you at, Rhonda?
R:  In Tennessee.
L:  Tennessee?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in, uh, Tampa, Florida.
R:  Oh.  Are you getting parts of the hurricane I guess?  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, no.
R:  No?
L:  No.  It's, uh -- well, we've had a lot of, uh, bad weather as far as rain but, uh, no -- no hurricane.  So --
R:  Yeah.  We got a lotta rain.
L:  -- or what do they call it, a tropical storm?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But any time it gets to be a tropical storm you start thinking, um, hurricane.  It gets scary.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess we're supposed to talk about current events.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that was a current event.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It is a current event.  Uh, I guess, uh, how do we stay in touch with current events?  Uh, how do you?
R:  I watch T.V.
L:  Uh-huh.  What channels do you watch?
R:  Um, we've got a satellite.  So, I watch a lot of different [LAUGH] channels.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, I don't know the -- I usually watch the Fox news channel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the M.S.M.B.C.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Stuff like that.
L:  And, um, how 'bout, um, computer or anything like that do you get any of it off ...?
R:  Yeah.  I see some of the news off the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't really go into the news on that.  I'm usually on that, um ...
L:  Mhm.  How 'bout the newspaper?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  I get the local newspaper.  I don't -- usually don't have a lot about -- our newspaper's got like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- three pages or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, goodness.  Ours was thin today and it was only, uh, maybe two pounds.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- and President Bush was on the front of it 'cause he was in Tampa --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- last night --
R:  I live like in ...
L:  -- digging up money for his, uh -- he wants to run again for president.  So, I -- what I was trying to figure is how -- I mean, they had the Secret Service and everything going on.  I'm like, you know, he's using all of our tax money to raise money for his reelection --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause it's costing the city and it's costing the country money to protect him and fly him around --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in that Air Force One.  So, uh, I -- maybe he's on vacation and he's writing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a check for all that.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I live in the mountains.  So, our newspaper don't -- you know, they -- they say like current things around here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they don't do that [inaudible].  If you wanna read that you've gotta get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a bigger town newspaper.
L:  Yeah.  Tampa's, uh -- I guess, you know, you have -- in -- in Florida ya got Miami and Orlando --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being the bigger cities, um, and then, uh, Tampa's maybe secondary market.  Um, we have a pretty good newspaper.  So, I get the newspaper every day, uh, delivered and, uh, just -- well, we pay for the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- weekend -- 'cause we like the weekend paper, but they're always trying to get the subscription up.  So, they offered to send it to us every day for the price of the weekend.  So, we say yes, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't have time to read it.  [LAUGH]  I'm a busy Mom and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I'll read the headline maybe and I'll read Ann Landers and maybe a cartoon or two and maybe a sale ad, but I don't think I get most of my news from the newspaper anymore.  It's just -- oh, you have to go through so much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff to get to the bottom line --
R:  I watch --
L:  -- of what's important.
R:  -- the Today Show in the mornings and usually they say a lotta stuff that's going on and okay, there's my news.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's it.
L:  Yeah.  That's a good one.  We have a -- a pretty good, uh, radio morning show here in Tampa.  Um, the disc jockey's kind of biased and, um [LIPSMACK], opinionated.  So, you have to filter through that because what you're listening to is the news interpreted -- interpreted --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, by the disc jockey.  So -- but if you can listen understanding that you're hearing something with his opinion spun on it, um -- I get -- I get a lot of my news from that because in the morning when I get up and I'm getting dressed or running from one room to the other I have the radio on in different rooms and I hear a lotta that and then they come in with the news breaks, but I still think I get most of my news from the disc jockey himself 'cause he'll always be talking about current events, like what do you think about la la la?  And sometimes he'll talk about like really stupid things [LAUGH] that people do --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's, uh -- it's kinda interesting.  Um, I don't know if I'm staying on top of world news the way I need to by listening to him though.  Um, I get some off the computer, um, but --
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's what I do.
L:  -- you know, when I log on to the computer --
R:  See the home page and look up areas that ...
L:  -- I get like the M.S.N. home page and I'll just -- yeah, and I'll --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- yeah, I'll skim through there, but I have to say I kinda go for the potato chip articles versus the meat.  I'll see, you know, some interesting article on crash tests of cars or -- I don't know, uh -- latest diets or -- or celebrity news or fashions of the red carpet or something like that and I'll probably click on that more than I'll click on, um, um, something worldly, which is bad.  But, you know, it's kind of like, you know, being in a doctor's office --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are ya gonna pick -- pick up People magazine or are ya gonna pick up, uh, U.S. news world report, you know?  [LAUGH]  So, uh, my husband gets News Week.  He reads that every week.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, but I can't.  Uh, it's too -- just too -- too much.
R:  Yep.  Me too.
L:  Too much.  I guess I want the news in five minutes --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- or less, um, otherwise it just starts to bog down your day.  Um, a lotta times I get like the most recent news from friends --
R:  Well, yeah.  Yep.
L:  -- um, stuff that's happening like immediately --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, right at the time.  Like when nine eleven happened --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I got phone calls from people saying --
R:  I was watching that when that happened --
L:  -- you know, you better tune into the T.V. quick --
R:  -- on the Today Show.  I was sitting --
L:  -- or, um, um ...
R:  -- watching the Today Show when it was going on.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  It was horrible.  Uh-huh.  And like when Princess Diana died, you know, someone said oh, you wa- -- you know, like if it's really, really, really top of page information, uh, I'll get a call from a friend or a family member or someone saying, you know, you wanna tune into the news or whatever and then I'll tune in --
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, uh, we do have to watch the water -- the weather here in Florida a lot, uh, because we have a lotta hurricanes and stuff.  So, when there's, uh, a weather advisory or whatever I watch cable --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, we have a station called Bay News Nine and they say -- their little motto is weather on the nine's.  So, every nine minutes you know that they'll get back to the weather.  So, that's kind of nice, but --
R:  Yeah.  I've been down there when --
L:  -- I only watch them when the weather's bad.
R:  -- the hurricanes came to Florida --
L:  I'm kind of a foul weather friend I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and my Dad said we're not leaving.
L:  Uh, if the weather's good ...
R:  [several inaudible words] you know, like a lotta rain and stuff and I was like we're leaving and Daddy's like we're not leaving, we're staying, and I was like okay --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's kinda mostly -- this has been [several inaudible words] he wouldn't leave [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he wasn't about to leave, we was on vacation and that's it.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, you know, if it ...
R:  Yep.  Look out at the rain.  Well, I was about fifteen or something I guess.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, what a vacation it was.  Were you a child when that happened?  Yeah.  I remember, uh, growing up in Tampa when there was a bad hurricane and we stuck it out in the house and -- and, uh, looking out the window and seeing everything and I think for a kid it's -- it's very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I don't know -- it left a permanent impression on my mind I know.  I just remember that storm and staying in our house and how high the water was getting and how big the winds were and I don't know if it's 'cause I was so little or just because it is a lot for a kid to go through but, uh, I remember that too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and my father too, nope, you're staying, we're sticking it out.  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Yep.  And my Mom praying.  I remember that too.
R:  [several inaudible words].  I was crying and everything, me and my brothers, and it's the only time I've ever been down in wind like that, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I tried to watch it, but I said I'm not going on vacation.
L:  Yeah.  It's scary.  It's scary.  Mhm.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I was, uh, checking the news on the computer the other day and they have like this computer aminat- -- am- -- I can't even talk -- animation now where you can watch like a streaming video of a storm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going across the state of Florida and it's like all these different colors and it just shows it going [MN], like coming from the Gulf of Mexico over Tampa and then like across the state of Florida and then it like repeats.
R:  How did you get that?
L:  So, you can see like -- I don't know -- every ten seconds you see this multi color storm going over.  I thought that was -- I thought it was pretty neat stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hadn't seen that before.  Usually on the com- -- usually I see stagnant pictures --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the computer, but not like --
R:  No.  Not around here.
L:  -- real weather coming in like that.  So ...
R:  Not unless you're gonna get the bigger newspaper.
L:  But I guess -- I guess for both of us the newspaper's not the way.
R:  But my Mom and him and get that.  So, if I wanna look at it I can go scan through it.
L:  It's not the way to get the news anymore.
R:  'Cause they both work in a big city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and they drive an hour --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to work and from work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, they get the big newspaper on Sundays and I get it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So [inaudible].  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it ain't real big compared -- you know, Atlanta's bigger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, there's a lot of -- you know, it's not --
L:  What's the city --
R:  -- it's a big city to us, but --
L:  -- for the newspaper?  It's a pretty big city.  So, uh ...  [PAUSE] Yeah.  Yeah.  Knoxville's nice.  Um, Atlanta is just -- it's just so big.  Atlanta has many, many cities and towns.
