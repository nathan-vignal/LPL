L:  Hi, this is Nicole.  Oh ...
R:  Yeah.  Hi, this is Roxanne.
L:  Hi, Roxanne.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, I ...
R:  I thought it said computer dating.  I didn't know it was gaming.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I know.  I haven't really done much computer games.  Um, have you done any?
R:  No.  And I think for me I -- I think once I get started on something like that it would be very difficult to, uh -- to stop.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true, if it was a fun one.  The only, uh, games I know -- I'm familiar with are, uh -- are like Solitaire.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh ...
R:  Oh, do they mean regular gaming or do they mean like gambling?
L:  I think -- oh, well, it's just Solitaire not -- you know, it's just a card game --
R:  Yeah.  I know.  I play Solitaire --
L:  -- you flip the cards.
R:  -- all the time when I'm at home.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you do.  Well, I think it probably qualifies as a computer game.
R:  Oh, okay.  'Cause I thought -- you know, uh, some of these people are actually, uh -- well, gamble online and in fact somebody, uh, got my daughter's, uh, uh, debit card I.D. and actually gambled on it and we had a big thing with the bank because she had this big withdrawal and, uh, somebody had gotten it.  So ...
L:  She gam- -- she actually gambled?
R:  Yeah.  So ...  Yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  So, I think a lotta banks are outlawing that now, at least Bank of America and a couple of others 'cause, uh ...  Yeah.  It was really, uh --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- it was really terrible.  She went in to, uh -- to look at her balance and she had like this two hun- -- two thousand dollar debit.  [LAUGH]  Like, she was really upset.  And, yeah --
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  -- and so, uh, you know, if they can get your I.D. that's something, uh -- a potential reason, which is why now it's outlawed.
L:  Yeah.  This one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this one is offline actually.
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah.  It's the one you play offline too.
R:  -- you know, what I have is just one the, uh -- you know, part of my computer, uh, you know, the regular, uh, thing.  It's not a, uh -- a kinda online thing.  Yeah.  I think they're -- they're asking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- about Internet stuff, which I don't -- really I haven't done any Internet stuff.  So ...
L:  Right.  Right.  Well, there's, uh -- and the others -- I -- I -- I also know there's actually, um -- my boyfriend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- used to play a lot --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- um, Pea Knuckle.  Have you ever heard of that game?  Yeah.  I'm -- I mean, I personally -- I -- I love the computer, but I've -- I've never --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- used, um --
R:  No.  I, uh -- I have --
L:  -- any of those things.
R:  -- I used to play a lotta human, uh, Pea Knuckle in the cafeteria when I was in school, but [LAUGH] I haven't played it on the computer.  Oh, yeah.  It used to be a big thing in our cafeteria.  So ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I'm from the East Coast --
L:  Is that -- are you from --
R:  -- I'm on the West Coast now.  But, yeah.
L:  -- the East Coast, West Coast?  Uh-huh.  Oh, right.  That's cool.  Yeah.  There's a lot of them -- I guess a lotta kids, um --
R:  Well, I'm sure they do and --
L:  -- you know, they can get, uh, computer games too --
R:  -- and see my daughter buys these, uh --
L:  -- the kind they ...
R:  -- like Nancy Drew games and stuff like that, you know, like [inaudible] used to be, uh, popular.  She gets these Nancy Drew mystery things.  So, she plays that.  They're regular computer games that are sorta mysteries.  So, she'll do that a lot of times.  So ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I've actually, uh -- I've ac- -- oh, I think I went the wrong okay.  Okay.  [LAUGH]  I actually, um -- my, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- my nephews they've played that, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Harry Potter.  I -- that's -- that's definitely one game that I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- did play with them where he kinda jumps from one place to the other --
R:  They're not that good.  So, I just, uh --
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  -- and -- and I've played a -- a couple of them as well --
L:  -- yeah.  So, that's, uh -- that's one that I've played.
R:  -- like on the video deals where they, uh, get 'em on T.V. and stuff.  But, uh -- but I just really haven't, uh, gotten all that involved with it to tell ya the truth.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.  What other things are there?  Uh, I see in the stores like these boxes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're -- they're like computer games, but I'm trying to figure out how the -- how that would --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- fit into a computer, how that works.
R:  Yeah.  They actually are on C.D. Rom.  That's true.
L:  Maybe it's just on C.D.  I think a lot of them I guess are on C.D.
R:  Well, and I imagine they're -- you can subscribe like anything else, uh --
L:  I know.
R:  -- to different types of game things if you would like to and I imagine -- just like you would, uh, join a club I imagine you could join --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a club and download these games, uh, from the Internet.  I imagine.  I don't know.
L:  [PAUSE] Right.  And there's -- there's ones where they like -- they try to -- I don't know if that's the --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it seemed like arcade games.  They're like -- like -- I remember the Teenage --
R:  On the computer itself.
L:  -- Mutant Ninja Turtles and stuff.  I don't know if they actually play those on, uh ...
R:  Oh, dear.  Oh, no.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I actually just -- I'm like driving and I got [LAUGH] off at the wrong place.  That's okay.  That's okay.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, anyway.  So, yeah -- so that's, uh -- I guess that's -- that's pretty much all I know.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  But I -- for -- for me --
R:  -- mean, it's -- it's easier for me to play whatever accessories come with my software --
L:  -- I -- I mean, it kinda inspires me to, uh --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- to play, but I haven't -- I really haven't myself done any of it.  So ...
R:  It's sort of the thing you have to have the time.  It used to be very relaxing, but it's not [several inaudible words].
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, um, making slides for presentations and, uh, looking up data.
L:  Right.  So, what do you -- what do you use your computer mostly for?
R:  You know, reference sources.  I'll look up articles and stuff like that and, uh -- and, um -- yeah, not too much else.  I will email of course and, uh -- and, uh, you know, sometimes I'll play games.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh -- but a lot of it just sort of looking at references and sources.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, about three of them I think.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I imagine so --
L:  Have you -- I don't know if it works a lotta the time, but --
R:  -- 'cause, uh --
L:  -- have you done a lotta these phone things?
R:  -- I think they call like maybe once a week or twice a week or something like that and then it's --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- it's sorta like in the evening.  So, if I happen to have the time I'll do it.
L:  You -- can you do more than three?
R:  If I don't have the time I won't but, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah, I got the information from, uh, an email from one of my friends.  So, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just thought I'd try it.  But, uh, like they have all sorts of different topics and things.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  It's very interesting.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well --
L:  Mhm.  Okay.
R:  -- I -- I don't know if there's a limit to how many that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're like limited to have.  I don't know.
L:  Yep.  I've -- I've missed a bunch of them.  But, yeah, they -- they call quite frequently.
R:  I don't know that I've a whole lot more to, uh ...  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't really know either.
R:  Yeah.  I imagine -- I would think the younger the individual is --
L:  Well --
R:  -- and we're not that young.  So, uh --
L:  -- I guess, uh [LAUGH] --
R:  -- I think the younger the people are the more use they are to, uh --
L:  -- I don't know what -- I don't have that much more to say --
R:  -- them sorta spending longer --
L:  -- I know about computer games.  Well, I guess we can hang up.
R:  -- besides it's a nice way to kill time if you just have, uh -- if you're [inaudible] a computer library or something like that.  I mean, it, uh -- it's a durable thing to do I guess.  And I imagine they have bingo and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true.  Yeah.  I don't -- do you know any games that cater to older people?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I would imagine they have older ...  And backgammon and, oh, see, that's where I think a lotta gambling stuff is too.
L:  Oh, yeah.  There's like cards.  I'm -- I'm asking my boyfriend 'cause he plays, uh, poker I guess.  Yeah.  I guess they ...
R:  Well, that's it.  I mean, it's very --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to do it.
L:  Wow!  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  It's crazy.  I guess -- so -- so they --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- probably do have a lotta gambling from the computers.  [NOISE]  Mhm.  Oh, the cars.
R:  Where are you?
L:  The mouse with the steering wheel.  I guess you can do car games and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm using my resources.
R:  Yeah, 'cause you [several inaudible words].
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm actually right around L.A.X. right now.  That's why I got lost.  But, yeah, I'm -- I'm in Los Angeles.  I'm from New York City originally though.
R:  Yeah.  I know [several inaudible words].
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  That's true.  All righty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I know what -- we have a -- what else do they have?  Oh, they have m- music things.  I mean, that's not really -- I don't know if that's a game --
R:  Hmm.  I guess --
L:  -- but they have like ...
R:  -- that's about it.  Yeah.  I don't know we're getting near ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that.  But they also -- yeah, for little kids they have like little, um, stories that have music --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just --
L:  -- to go along with it and stuff.
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah.  That kinda thing.  Anyway.
R:  -- and -- and, uh, you know, it can honestly do a lotta stuff --
L:  All right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the computer games on television, you know, the, uh, M.B.A. and the basketball ones --
L:  Yeah.  I know.  Really.
R:  -- and things like that.
L:  But have you ever played any games --
R:  So, rather than do 'em on the computer they'll do it on the T.V. screen --
L:  -- I guess other than cards?
R:  -- you know, like a, uh -- the Sega and X. Box and all that kinda thing.  So, uh, it doesn't really ...  Mm?  I can imagine they have F- Frogger on the computer I would think.  Oh, it's a real --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- like Atari type.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  You too.
L:  Frogger?
R:  Yeah.  I guess so.  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.
L:  What is Frogger?  Oh, yeah.  My -- I think my nephews do have that.  [LAUGH]  God, that's kinda silly.  Oh, well.  Okay.  Well, it's good talking to you.  I think that must be about ten minutes.  Okay.  Take care.  Bye-bye.
