L:  Hello [NOISE].  Hello [NOISE].  Hello [NOISE].  Hello.
R:  Hello.  [NOISE] Yes, hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE].
L:  Hi.
R:  Uh, yes, uh-huh.
L:  Is you -- are you on some current events?  Okay and where are --
R:  I'm from Heatherford, Pennsylvania.
L:  -- from?
R:  Suburban Philadelphia.
L:  Okay, well, my name is Susan and I'm from the --
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  -- Saint Louis Missouri area.
R:  Well, nice to chat with you, Susan.  My name is Glen.
L:  [MN] It's nice to talk to you [NOISE].
R:  Um, have --
L:  Okay and the topic of the day --
R:  Current events.
L:  -- I guess is current events and how we, uh --
R:  Mhm [LIPSMACK].
L:  -- get those and our current events usually comes in the form of a --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- newspaper every morning --
R:  The news.
L:  -- or it's the news.
R:  Yeah, uh.
L:  Right, I mean, the news pretty much -- even my kids listen to the news to find out what's going --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on in the world and just different things that --
R:  Uh, how old are your kids?
L:  --  happen around here.  [LIPSMACK]  I have a --
R:  Uh, uh-huh.
L:  -- four year old and a ten year old and even the smallest one, they all know it's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Fox Two News.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Which news channel do you usually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- listen to?  Fox Two?
L:  This is the Fox Two.
R:  Is that a local news programme?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or is that the net [NOISE] how --
L:  It's a local one here for the area but s- -- and they have --
R:  I see.
L:  -- a lot of current events that happen around here and they have different, um --
R:  Hm, mhm.
L:  -- different things that go on, 'cause they have a guy that goes out and they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just check out the current events, you know, and they have different sections of, you know, like the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- sports --
R:  I see.
L:  -- and all those other different things.
R:  So, it's mostly a local station as opposed to current events, um, happening overseas or, you know, world news, things like that?
L:  Well, world news we -- we get that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- off -- off the news, too, wit- -- but mostly, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- mostly the news that we listen to is the local --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and of course they have things --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  -- that go on overseas, too.  So, I mean, you can get the current events off of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yahoo --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which, you know, when you log in there --
R:  Yes, huh --
L:  -- it has it on there, too.
R:  -- depending on how you've set it up what ca- -- what category of news you can get on there, um.
L:  Right [LIPSMACK].  I know my husband at work he has the list of different news channels --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sports, newspapers and different --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- newspapers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he goes through there 'cause he's originally from Maine so he has the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Maine newspaper bookmarked so [NOISE] he gets the current --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- events that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- go on up there through the Internet.
R:  Oh.  Um --
L:  So --
R:  -- well, are we supposed to be talking about -- about current events, uh, kind of in general or kind of going into specific current events and talk about those events?  Do you have any idea? [NOISE]
L:  Well, I think it is just how --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- you get your current event, the different choices --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- how you do get --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- your -- your current events --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I -- I know with us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we get the paper and that's delivered so [MN] -- and we -- we have a local paper here and it's a free paper and -- day Wednesday and Sunday --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I sit down and tho- -- those are the days that it's delivered, but I w- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we sit down and we read that and we find out what's going around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on around just in our local area 'cause like I said I'm in the Saint Louis area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm not in --
R:  Suburban --
L:  -- Saint Louis so to speak.
R:  --  is the -- yeah.
L:  I'm in a smaller [MN] -- yeah, [LIPSMACK] outside there so ours --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just covers -- the -- the Journal just covers our area here --
R:  And that's a subscription thing --
L:  -- instead of the big Saint Louis area because it's huge.
R:  -- you pay for?  Oh, oh, interesting.
L:  No, actually it's a free newspaper that they send out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they got, you know, d- bunch of smaller towns so they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, like ours is Saint Charles so they'll --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- deliver the Saint Charles' journal to the people who live in Saint Charles --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there's pretty much the same paper but --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- you know, they would deliver it to O'Fallon, which is another town --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but they would have the O'Fallon --
R:  Uh-huh, with -- yeah.
L:  -- current events in that one.
R:  Overlap.
L:  You know, and things that are the same --
R:  Yeah, we get, uh, something like that --
L:  -- you know, it would be in both papers.
R:  -- also.  Um, it seems to be I would say ninety percent advertisements.  That's probably how they can s- [LAUGH] send it out for free and they you have -- root through the advertisements to find the little current events, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, local interest stories [LIPSMACK], um, so we -- we get that, uh, for free also, uh, and, uh, it seems to be okay.  You can find basic, uh, information in it, um, but a lot of the things -- even their feature articles often, uh, seem to be, um, [LIPSMACK] seem to be, uh, kind of hidden advertisements where it looks like it's an article but it's really an advertisement for the person who is being featured.  Um, they have somebody who does, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- restaurant reviews for example, and I've been looking at those restaurant reviews for about a y- -- two years and I've never seen one that was even slightly negative [LAUGH], and I can't believe that every week for two years this person has been going to restaurants and has never had a single --
L:  Right.
R:  -- negative experience [NOISE].  Yeah, but what's all that review worth if they don't tell you --
L:  Well, maybe they just don't like the negative --
R:  -- you know, what's not good [LAUGH].
L:  -- or write about the negative ones.
R:  [LAUGH] but anyway --
L:  Well, you're right.
R:  Yeah, I guess, uh, w- we pretty much --
L:  Very true.
R:  -- um [LIPSMACK], watch the Fox news also but, uh, there's a local Fox news and a national Fox new -- m- [MN] We tend to watch the national news more than the local news.  Yeah.  Mm.
L:  Oh, we watch the national news, too, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'd say the majority of the time --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- just the traffic --
R:  How about the radio, like --
L:  -- the weather --
R:  -- when you're driving do you check out --
L:  -- you know, just local things that are happening around --
R:  -- the local news station or --
L:  -- here we watch the local news [NOISE].
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, not so much the radio.  No, because, I mean, I'm not in the car that much --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- where the radio's on so I would say, I mean, that's pretty much just a music entertainment thing but we do get, um, entertainment or events through the Internet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as far as email.  You know, because I've gone to different, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- news channels that we do have and they can email you with the current events that's going on.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  So, I've done that, too, because we do.  We like to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- take our kids to different places --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- different things that are going on --
R:  I just found out about something interesting in the area here.
L:  -- and the way to find that out is just, you know, people have to tell you.
R:  It's called, uh, Hilly fun guide dot com and every week on --
L:  I mean, you can go and you can do your research but that's how we get a lot of that.
R:  -- Wednesday they send out -- Wednesday or Thursday -- they send out an email that has events like specials because you signed up for this particular, uh, venue then, uh, with the little email that they sent you it's half price for all kinds of different, um, days and music events and things for the kids and, uh, all kinds of things for the -- for the upcoming weekend, so, that's really a nice thing 'cause, uh [NOISE], not only do they tell you about it but, uh, you also get half price tickets for these things so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, I wonder if they have that in other cities as well.
L:  Well, that is -- that is a good thing.
R:  [NOISE] Mm, mhm, mhm [NOISE].
L:  They may -- they -- they -- I know that they have a lot of stuff in Saint Louis because it's so big --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but as far as getting the, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- half price tickets --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't -- I don't know about that because, I mean, you can go and you can do the search on the Internet [MN], you know, for things that are going on around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they do have that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's pretty much our, um --
R:  Yeah, or even from --
L:  -- you know, the way that we find out the current events.
R:  -- political organizations if you belong to, you know --
L:  We don't have any newsletters --
R:  -- the pic- pic- political party and then they will send you information or --
L:  -- that we get from anybody.  I know that there are newsletters that go out -- different happenings.
R:  -- interest groups of -- if you like square dancing then you get the square dancing newsletter and they tell you things.  Um [LIPSMACK] [MN] Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, well we don't --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- get any newsletters like that so --
R:  [MN] Mhm.
L:  Most of our -- I mean, we do -- actually what we do get --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is we get like, um, [LIPSMACK] a magazine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it comes out quarterly and it's from the County, just different things that are just happening in the County which is -- which is good, and they advertise different places and, you know, what fa-...
