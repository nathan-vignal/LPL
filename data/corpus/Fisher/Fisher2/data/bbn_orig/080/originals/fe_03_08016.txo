R:  Hi, my name's Pam.
L:  Hi Pam, this is Alicia.
R:  Um --
L:  Ah, [LAUGH] the topic is movies [LAUGH] I don't know how much I'm going to get into this one.  I don't really like going to the movies.
R:  Well, do you prefer to rent them?
L:  Well, we get, um, the satellite, so we go -- we watch movies on the satellite --
R:  Um --
L:  -- the disk, direct TV.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's kind of like --
L:  Renting them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] I'm not much of a TV person, so I don't know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I work two jobs.  I don't have no -- actually no time to watch TV.
R:  Yeah.  I work --
L:  So which do you prefer?
R:  -- a lot of hours too, but I took my nephew to see Holes last night.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It was kind of funny.
L:  Well, I won, um, Hawk tickets to go see The Hawk --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I guess I'm going to go to that some time, I'm not sure when but, hm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that'll be my next m- -- my next movie [LAUGH] and I can't even think of the movie I watched last.
R:  Wow.  Um, we're going to go to the late movie tonight and see Finding Nemo.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, sometimes I do, um, movie checks and, um, I count, ah, the people going to the movies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, sometimes it's an open check where the movie theater knows that I'm there and sometimes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's, um, not.  Like when I went to see The Italian Job and I just had to buy tickets for every show and sit there and count people --
L:  Oh, no kidding.
R:  -- as they came in.  But it's a way to make extra money.
L:  Oh, no kidding.
R:  Yeah, all part time jobs where --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I can set my own hours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  And plus you get to watch a movie.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, it kind of -- it's kind of like this, you know, you get --
L:  Right.
R:  -- paid for it but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you don't have to really declare it 'cause you're not making that much money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so [NOISE] -- but I really like to go to eat the popcorn.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH] And you live ...?
R:  Um, in Kansas.  [MN]
L:  Oh, in Kansas.  I'm in central New York.
R:  Oh, I was born --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in Connecticut.
L:  Oh, I go up there a lot too to the casino.  It's excellent.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well, I was born in Stanford.
L:  Oh.  Yep.
R:  Huh.
L:  So I guess as far as the movies, I'm, ah, home -- rather watch it at home unless there's something really, really good on that I see a preview of --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like a scary movie or something, [LAUGH] I think I'd prefer to watch it at the theater.
R:  Like that Twenty Eight Days After?
L:  No, I didn't see that, uh.  Is that a scary movie?
R:  Yeah, it's just coming out --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it's like really scary.  My husband wants to see it.  I told him he could watch that while I watch something else.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's got zombies and stuff in it and I'm just [SIGH] -- it can be a little scary but not -- not too much [MN].
L:  Right.
R:  I'm just not --
L:  Hm.  And that's out in the movies now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Hm.
R:  It's like this guy, um, falls asleep in a hospital, or he's in a coma or something and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he wakes up and everybody's gone but they're just zombies and when the sun goes down they wake up and --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- or some such thing, a- a- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's like, "No, I don't think I want to watch that".
L:  So you're not into the horror movies?  [LAUGH]
R:  No, not -- not really into --
L:  No.
R:  -- horror, really scary movies.  I mean, I can -- I can do them if they're a little scary but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah, I have to sleep at nights and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I stay up really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- late anyway --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, I'm the last one to go -- go to bed and anything that's going bump in the night --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm gonna hear it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd rather watch a comedy.
L:  Yeah, comedies are funny.  I -- I -- I don't know, I -- I don't think I'd want to go to a theater to watch a comedy though, I think I'd rather just stay at home.
R:  Yeah.  Well, but you can't get that movie theater popcorn at home.
L:  Oh, well that's true.  [LAUGH]
R:  Say --
L:  They always got the [inaudible] though.
R:  Yeah.  Good.
L:  Plus, the -- the popcorn there is so expensive.
R:  Well --
L:  It's, ah -- it costs you more to eat popcorn and get a drink than it is to watch the movie.
R:  Well, it -- I think it's cheaper here, you know, like if you go to the early show it's -- and -- and then we've got a place where it's only two dollars to go to the movies.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, that's not bad.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  But then it's the refreshments, real expensive.
R:  Well, it's like five dollars for a real big tub of popcorn --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you can get refills the same day and three --
L:  R- --
R:  -- dollars for a big thing of pop --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and you can get refills.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I bring, like, um, a bag from Walmart and then that way, um, I just dump the popcorn in there so I can get my refill right away, then I don't have to lean over to share it.
L:  Right.  Well, that's a good idea.
R:  Especially if we go to the late show, 'cause they're not going to be open when, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  They close right away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, I'm definitely not paying five dollars for one bucket of popcorn --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  So, how did you hear about this?
L:  Um, on the internet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yep.
R:  Well, I do mystery shopping and, um --
L:  Oh, I don't do the mystery shopping, n- -- I would like to get into that.
R:  -- and that's how I heard about it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  But no, this is -- this is actually my third phone call.
R:  This is my second one.
L:  The second one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I had one, um, [MN] I think last week and they put me on hold forever.  T- they couldn't find anybody to do the survey with so I just [NOISE] said I'd catch it some other time.
R:  Wow.  Well, they, ah -- they keep calling me on my cell phone which is what I told them to do and I'm -- I never have it on.
L:  [LAUGH] Isn't that funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, I figured this time I would call them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, and they had called me yesterday right after I'd turned it on, so that kind of reminded me about it.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, they're always popping up on my caller ID here, and I miss a lot of them too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they're interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  M- my last one was, um, bad habits.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yesterday it was affirmative action.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, kind of hard to talk about that.  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have to worry about who you're talking to and --
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  -- movies is way easier.
L:  Oh yeah, movies is great.  I've been thinking when they said, "Movie topics", I'm thinking, "Oh my god, I don't even like to go to the movies" [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I guess that's okay because it's my opinion about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Think I'm not a movie -- I don't have time, I work thirteen hour days --
R:  Oh, my goodness.  What do you do?
L:  -- almost, yeah.  I got two different jobs.  I work, um, full time at one job and part time in another, and I usually am working almost every single day thirteen hours.
R:  Oh, what kind of work?
L:  Um, one's in a rehab --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then one I'm a supervisor in dietary --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, I'm two different places, dealing with people.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  But, yeah, it's -- it's tough.  When I get home at eight and, yeah, I'm exhausted.  [LAUGH]
R:  Gosh, I work at a post office and that just exhausts me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I might be sick so who knows?
L:  You might be sick?
R:  Yeah, I might have MS --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't know.  But that's not like anything about the movies so --
L:  Ah, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you probably don't want to hear about that, so --
L:  Did you just find out about that?
R:  Oh, I'm going to get a lumbar puncture tomorrow --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to find out.
L:  Oh, sorry to hear that, mm.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Uh-huh, hm.
R:  So, oh, well.
L:  Does it run in your family?
R:  No.
L:  Not at all?
R:  Not that I know of, and I -- I don't stay in touch with my father's side of the family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So.
L:  [NOISE] So you wouldn't know.
R:  Yeah, but [SIGH] it's just weird.
L:  Gosh, yeah it is weird.  [LAUGH] That's okay, I go to the doct- -- I went to the doctor, this isn't about movies neither but [LAUGH] he had some mine- --
