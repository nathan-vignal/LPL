R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Cathy.
L:  Hi, Cathy.  My name's Amelia.
R:  Okay.  Where are you calling from?
L:  New York.
R:  I'm in Ohio.
L:  Uh-huh.  Nice to talk with you.
R:  Is it hot there today?
L:  It's hot.  Yeah.  But it's not as humid.
R:  Uh, it's still --
L:  It's been ...
R:  -- pretty bad here today.
L:  Is it really?
R:  It rained all around us, but not here.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] So, it made it real steamy here.
L:  What -- what, uh -- what temperature do you normally get there?
R:  Oh, it's been in the nineties lately.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  We just had, uh -- we've been having some pretty hot weather and it just kind of broke a little bit.  So, we don't have the humidity, but we're expecting it back again.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's been like that here.  I've been away and I just came back here and it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know?  I was just in Northern Ohio, but I live in Southern Ohio now and it's just the same.  I was hoping it'd be cooler down here.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I -- before we I guess on the con- -- I just wanna ask you a quick question about the, uh, U. Penn project.  Are we only allowed to do three or is there more that we can do?
R:  Um [COUGH], this is my third.  I think it said something about we could do three.  But it said something about you could do -- well, do you have more than one type of -- more than one phone number?
L:  No.
R:  Well, if you do -- I just have one.  But it said something about if you dialed 'em yourself you could do two more.  I don't know how, you know ...?
L:  Oh, if you dial 'em in yourself you mean, um ...?
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm not sure.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But that's what I had heard.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  Um, well, how do you get, uh, most of your news?
L:  Well, I -- I usually get it on the news -- actually always, you know?  I -- I do listen to the radio, um, and in the evenings I'll watch the news, um, not all the time but, uh, more listen to the radio I guess and sometimes I get the paper.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I guess basically, um, I get the news over the radio.  What about yourself?
R:  I get most of mine off T.V.
L:  Okay.
R:  I used to -- I get one local paper.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it only comes out twice a week and it doesn't -- it has more local news, but we used to get [COUGH], you know, that other paper and we didn't never have time to read it.  They were piling up [LAUGH] and we didn't have -- so I stopped them for a while, but --
L:  Oh, you did.  Mhm.
R:  -- then I'm also on the computer and I get -- a lotta news comes in, uh -- you know, I get news that comes in on my [LAUGH] email.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  So, I just --
L:  -- that's true too.  Yes.
R:  -- go ahead and read that too.  So ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I have the radio on when I'm in the car.  That's about all I -- keep it -- well, we have a local, uh, radio news program that I listen to every day.  That's how I get my local news.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Mhm.  That's -- yeah, the local news is how I get my -- the radio, uh -- through the radio and then I'll listen, you know, not all the time but, uh, to the television for -- for, you know, national news and stuff.
R:  But actually our local one [COUGH] -- local radio st- -- they have it on the T.V.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- for a half hour of, uh --
L:  Oh, they do?
R:  -- a local show.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I watch that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's, you know ...?  People don't like the newsman that does it, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- everyone you talk to watches him.  He's one of those -- he has hair wrapped all around his head.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's bald and he wraps it all around.
L:  Oh, does he?
R:  So, people are always laughing at him.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  But [LAUGH] he does that and he'll tell -- oh, yes, this other radio station, the T.V. station wanna -- want him to come in.  I'm sure they do.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, yep ...
L:  It's surprising that he feels comfortable like that.
R:  Yeah.  And people don't wanna admit that they watch him, but everyone does.
L:  Everyone does?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, that's -- he gets the news before -- he goes out, you know, in the town.  He knows what going on and it'll come out there before it's on the paper.  So, it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really is good.
L:  Yes.  Um, what was the other part of the question?  I didn't, um -- was there another part of the question or it's just about that?
R:  I think, uh -- I think she said how we --
L:  How we get the news?
R:  -- get most of our news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, do you live in a big city in New York or ...?
L:  Yes.  I live in Queens.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, I -- I visited, uh, New York City once.  Well, my sister used to live there --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, uh, we went to Brooklyn, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think I ever made it to Queens.  But, you know, that's -- I've been there a couple of times to visit, but that's all.
L:  Yes.  Well, it's still, uh -- at least ya got a -- a feel for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I like to visit it, but I -- I couldn't [LAUGH] -- I couldn't live there.  I like the small towns better.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  So, have you always lived there?
L:  I've always lived, um -- I -- I was raised on Long Island.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, um, I was out -- I lived in the suburbs.  Then as I got a little older I did, um, move into the city and then I did move out of the state for a while and really I -- this is -- it's okay because I have friends and stuff here, but it's not my ideal place.  I would rather live in the mountains.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Upstate New York is really pretty.  Mhm.  What about yourself, are you in the city or are in, um ...?
R:  [COUGH] No, just a small town.  It's --
L:  Is it Akron -- by Akron or ...?
R:  -- they say there's five thousand in it, but I don't -- I think they're counting all the [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- everyone all around.
L:  Is -- is it, uh, around Akron or, uh ...?
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  We're at the other end.  That's northern.  We're in the southern part.
L:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.
R:  Uh, it's about -- be about a four hour trip to --
L:  Mhm,  Mhm.
R:  -- go up there, but I have -- my aunt just died up there and we went there, plus I -- my brother lives there and we have family up there.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I grew up there.  That's where I go most of the time when I [LAUGH] leave here.  But, uh ...
L:  Do you get a lotta storms down in Ohio?  Like, uh, around now I guess I'm hearing about some storms.  I'm wondering if you get like tornadoes or anything like that or ...?
R:  Um, rare.
L:  Rare.
R:  That's one good thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, they said that there was a little earthquake, but just enough that -- they said it was like this truck going by -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they -- you know, they count that because we don't [LAUGH] -- I think they said that's the hundred and twentieth one ever --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in this whole area they keep a record of it.  So, you know, I would never have known it if they hadn't told us, but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, you didn't feel it then at all?
R:  No.  No.  I didn't even know it.
L:  Well, that was -- that's good.  That's good.
R:  No.  We were, uh, at Regals Beach, which is up by Lake Erie --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, many years ago on vacation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we were supposed to stay there the whole week and by Wednesday there was a tornado that was so bad there was rubble all over the beach and they sent everyone away.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- that was one of the worst ones I have seen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we went back to Columbus and stayed with my sister the rest of the vacation, the rest of the week, and then came back down here.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, yeah, that was -- I mean, it was awful and I had a three month old baby [LAUGH] with us at the time.  It was scary.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  But, um ...
L:  Did you, um -- so do you have a, um [LIPSMACK] -- how -- oh, what was I going say?  The, um [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  Oh, about my children?
L:  No.  There was some- --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, something about what you said about the, um -- oh, I -- I don't remember now.  Um --
R:  Do you have any children?
L:  -- oh, the -- the lake, about the lake, uh -- the lake is by you?
R:  Oh, no, no, no.  That's south of -- when we were in Akron.  We didn't go on it though --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- no, we just were up there for a vacation one year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.  I have one son.  And you?
R:  I have three.  They're all grown and I've got grandchildren now.
L:  Oh.
R:  Just had a new one.  She's two months old.  So ...
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  How old is your son?
L:  Sixteen.
R:  Mm.
L:  The tumultuous teen years.
R:  Mhm.  Is he starting to drive now?
L:  Well, he -- he wants to get his permit, but I'm trying to, uh, stall him.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's -- my son he -- when he was sixteen he wanted it.  He didn't get it until he was seventeen.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  All the other kids were driving, but I just -- I'm too cautious --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he was into -- he was the captain of the football team and so into sports that much that I was able to, you know [LAUGH], keep him into that.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  But then my two daughters as soon as they were sixteen they were ready to drive.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The one -- she's real industrious and she got her a job at McDonalds right away.  So, I started driving her, but it got to be such a hassle that pretty soon we let her go ahead and drive.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
R:  But it wasn't -- you know, it wasn't very far, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At sixteen I guess, um [LIPSMACK], in Ohio, um, it's probably different to driving, you know ...?  [COUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Well, now they start at -- at fifteen and a half they can start -- can they do that there now?
L:  No.
R:  They can do it -- they can take lessons and drive with the parent in the car, but they can't get their license until they're sixteen.  I really don't like it.  I think it's -- they're too young.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think sixteen is too young.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't get mine 'til I was twenty one, but ...
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH] I think, um, they're going to -- to raise the age limit here --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, of your driving.  You can get that permit at sixteen and drive when you're seventeen.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I think they're going to raise that [COUGH] and maybe change it to eighteen that they can drive.
R:  Well, they haven't even said anything, you know, and they start and -- 'cause it was always sixteen.  Now they've moved it back to fifteen and a half --
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's really young.
R:  -- and I think that's just way too young.
L:  I don't know why they would that because teens are the ones that are most responsible for most of the, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the accidents.  So ...
R:  But they're saying that they have to drive a hundred hours with their parents in the car --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and that's supposed to get 'em used to it, but I still don't think they should start it at --
L:  No.
R:  -- fifteen.  [LAUGH]  I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause as soon as, you know, kids get to that age where they're ready, as soon as they have that fifteenth birthday they're already counting until [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they can do it, but ...
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I was just kinda afraid when I was -- sixteen even I didn't want to try.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I took driving lessons I think, um, when I was in high school and then I --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and then I started driving when I was, um, eighteen.  [COUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, my Dad was the first one to teach me and he was the type that was real nervous and he made me nervous.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Pretty soon he said I can't teach you and I thought yeah, I don't want you to.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's better to have someone else.  So, my aunt ended up trying, but ...
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And my, uh -- my father tried to teach my Mom too but, uh, she said no, I'll take driving instructions.
R:  Yeah.  But see they didn't have it, you know, in here at that time.  Now, you know, you can take it at Triple A. --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and the school started having it again after that and they've quit again now.  The school didn't wanna get involved, something about the insurance here at our school, you know?  We just have one school [LAUGH] in this small town.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's -- you know ...?
L:  Oh, you do.  Oh, okay.  [COUGH]
R:  It's, you know, one high school and one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, middle school, one grade school and one primary.  There's just -- you know, there's four schools.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know ...?  Well, I was a teacher.  That's -- so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, do you, um -- I guess all your children live around you?
R:  Uh, well --
L:  Close by?
R:  -- one does.  Two live in Columbus, which is about sixty miles from us.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  It's -- I think there's something, you know, nice about living in a small town --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, where you can get to know everyone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I mean -- well, it used to be when I was little, you know, you knew everyone and then we built, uh -- there's a new atomic plant down here and people came from all over to build that and now, you know, it's -- now it's where you don't know people.  It used to be you knew everyone.  My Dad knew everyone in town and, you know, he would tell us -- we knew everybody, but it's just not like that anymore --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and just --
