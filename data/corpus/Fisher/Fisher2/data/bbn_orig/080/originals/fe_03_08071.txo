L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  My name is Cherie.
R:  Hi, this is Rochelle Marsha.
L:  How are you today?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  This is my first call.  So, bear with me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's mine too.
L:  Is it?  Okay.  Good.  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about where we get our information --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for current events?
R:  Okay.
L:  If you wanna start go ahead.
R:  Um, what are the options again for the -- where I get them?
L:  [NOISE] I thought it was, uh, T.V., uh, newspapers and magazines.  I -- I believe that was what the recording said.
R:  Okay.  Um, well, I do get most of mine from the T.V.  Uh, I watch the eleven o'clock news here and there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ...
L:  I, um, don't have a T.V., but I can -- I listen to the news usually every morning I'll have it on at seven --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and get the morning news and every night at eleven and I do try to catch the paper every night.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I can keep abreast of what's going on.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I do get the paper every day, um, and Sunday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  And I also, um, subscribe to U.S. News, which is a weekly magazine and helps me stay on top of it.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that pretty much exhausts the list here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ten more minutes.  Okay.  Um, I also, not frequently, but check the Internet.  Um, I like CNN's website.  I like, um, our local, uh, paper --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- website.  Have you checked your -- do you search the Internet much or ...?
R:  Um, yeah, I do actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A lot.  Um, I -- I do the local -- the local paper.
L:  Right.
R:  I never do check C.N.N., um ...
L:  During the war their coverage was real, uh -- I really liked their -- you know, it was more up to date, by the minute, by the hour, whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, of course I don't have a T.V.  So, that helped me to be able to see pictures sometimes that I wouldn't see in the paper.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I liked that.
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, my -- my local paper pretty much covers everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, 'cause I live in a big city, so --
L:  I see.
R:  -- so I do get -- I do get a lot of news on that page.  Um, there's a lotta world news and there's local news together.  So --
L:  Right.  That's good.
R:  -- so I just stick with that.
L:  [LAUGH] We recently started subscribing to, um -- we're just about like forty minutes from a -- a large major city and so I started subscribing to their paper because our local paper is good for local --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I don't get a good, um, world coverage from it.
R:  Right.
L:  But on the other hand I hate to cancel the local paper 'cause, you know, I wanna keep up on who's marrying and dying and ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Um, yeah, my local paper is the big city.  So --
L:  I see.
R:  -- so, yeah, it's what, um -- I mean, the whole state can get it.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that's pretty good.  I don't know if you can say where you're from or not.  Can you?
L:  I don't either.  I'm from Ohio.  [LAUGH]  I'll just say.
R:  Okay.  I'm from Massachusetts, Bos- --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I -- I live in Boston.
L:  Neat.
R:  So -- yeah.  So ...
L:  Did you hear about this on the Internet?
R:  Yeah.  On, um, a place called Craig's List.
L:  Oh, okay.  I did -- I was on a, um, refunding website and signed up.  So ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I've missed a couple of calls.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, today when I got it I was like oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I have too.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's interesting.
R:  Mhm.  Um ...
L:  And I recently -- I'll -- I'll try -- try to stay on topic here, um -- subscribed to Time.  I found a really good bargain on the Internet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's another magazine I think is [NOISE], um -- helps, you know, keep on top of what's going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I did read where one person said that, um, they had trouble continuing to talk about the same topic [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for ten minutes and that's me.  I jump around.  I'm really bad about that.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  [NOISE] Um, what -- yeah.  I was gonna say something.  Um, yeah, I don't -- I don't subscribe to any -- any news type magazines.  So, I don't really -- I mean, I did subscribe to -- or got sent to me, uh, Fortune magazine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, news about the economy, but that's about it.
L:  I see.
R:  But, um, other than that it's just newspapers, the, um, T.V. and the Internet basically.
L:  My, um, kids usually have a magazine sale through their school once a year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- 'cause I find like U.S. News and Time to be very expensive with 'em being a weekly magazine --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they have very, very good bargains --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, so that's one reason why I sub- started subscribing and I like -- you -- not only do you get -- like, in your paper you might get, you know, three or columns and -- and you also get like an end up story --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I find that, um, more, you know, attention grabbing, keeps your interest.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Um, I usually go with T.V. mostly because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with the Internet, um -- I -- I don't know what it is, but the T.V. it -- it tells me more than the Internet does --
L:  Right.  I see.
R:  -- although you can click on other things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, to find out other stuff that goes with it.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  But, um ...
L:  I know with -- with the news that I listen to, um, in the morning and in the evening if I miss a couple of days I feel so out of the loop --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's going on and especially during the war it was just almost, you know -- or like during nine eleven I -- I had the radio on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, c- constantly for days --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, just [NOISE] -- and after all it was kinda like information overload [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  But [NOISE] ...  I have four children and I have trouble getting away from them [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the phone.
R:  I hear that.
L:  [MN] So ...
R:  But, um, yeah, during nine eleven I, uh -- I mainly watched the T.V. --
L:  I see.  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and kept up to date on -- on, uh, the Internet.  See, the plane that was, you know, flying into one of the buildings --
L:  Right.
R:  -- came from Boston.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there was a huge scare in Boston --
L:  Oh, no doubt.
R:  -- and, you know, we have a World Trade Center as well.  So ...
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  It's, um ...
L:  That would probably be one of the times that it was -- it was a little hard not having a T.V.  I had my radio on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, right after the -- the plane had hit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the first plane and so I was listening, you know, during the second one and that was a time I just -- you needed a -- you needed a picture, you know?  The words just weren't giving you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  When I first heard it I was actually [COUGH] -- I was actually on the -- on the road for a business trip and, um, you know, we do like door to door sales or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I walked into this business and, you know, some lady was on the phone and she's like, "You don't know what's going on?" 'cause I tried to sell her something [LAUGH] or whatever --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so I was like I have no clue.  So, I turned on my radio and I was like wow --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, in my car and then I went to the nearest coffee shop and watched it on T.V.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So ...  But after that it was a big scare and our road trip was in Maine actually where the small plane had, you know, dropped them off or whatever to go to Boston.
L:  Oh.
R:  I guess they had taken like a -- a single plane.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, yeah, that was in Portland, in Portland, Maine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the plane left from Boston.  So, I was right where everything was.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  We had, uh -- our vacation this past year we went to, uh, right outside Shanksberg where the plane went down and it is just so moving.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It just really -- is really neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh -- but, you know, they keep saying it's one of those where were you at when Kennedy was shot and where were you at ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I mean, it's just like cry- crystal clear, I can just see me right there glued to that radio.  [LAUGH]  I mean, I was right in the kitchen and I just couldn't move and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Very bad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ...
R:  Yeah.  That was a bad time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think our ten minutes is about up?  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Not that I don't like talking to you, but I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I feel confined on this one topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know last time when I got a call that I had to wait forever.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I just hung up.  But the topic was food.
L:  Oh, there we go!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I could go for ages about that one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, when they first said current events I thought so help me if I've gotta pick one current event I'm gonna blank, you know?  Okay.  Let's see, the President, uh, the economy and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- I was like okay, well [inaudible] you get it that's -- that's a little bit better, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after we've exhausted the Internet and the radio and the paper and the T.V.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, and the other one was -- was people too.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like friends or whatever.
L:  Okay.  No.  I'd forgotten that one.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I have a lotta -- I have a lot of political friends who are against Bush.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I myself am against Bush as well.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know how you feel about Bush.
L:  I personally -- I like him.  I, um --
R:  Oh, you do.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm a conservative.  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.  Um, yeah, I actually -- I -- I register with the Green Party.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, I don't know.  He [COUGH] -- he's actually cut funds to a lotta places in -- in Boston with, um, planned parenthood.  I don't know if -- if you guys have those out there.
L:  Mhm.  Yes.  We do.
R:  Um, yeah, they -- he's cut funds to all the planned parenthoods around here.  So, a lotta women, you know, can't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- can't go and, you know -- who -- who don't have enough money to get things done --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, to get regular check ups or whatever.  Um --
