L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] My name's Marsha.
R:  My name is Jen.  How are ya?
L:  Fine.  I'm in Houston.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Jersey City, New Jersey.
L:  Oh.  You don't have an accent.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, where do you get your current event information?
R:  Um, lately I've been really turned off by current events and I've been following them less and less.  There was a time when I was reading the newspaper pretty religiously and then my husband used to turn on C.N.N. all the time and when we lived in Belgium we were watching, uh, B.B.C. World all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, honestly we don't even get half of the jokes on Jay Reno --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause we're disgusted when we watch the news that we just turn it off.
L:  Yeah.  I'm pretty much the same way.  I don't get the local paper.  I don't watch the local news.  It's all just too depressing and, um -- but I do -- I do watch, um, headline news in the morning while I'm getting ready, but I don't really -- you know, ready for work -- I don't really pay that much attention to it and then during the day I keep an eye out on, um, Yahoo just to see what's going on.  But, um, yeah, I don't stay up late for those shows anymore.  [LAUGH]  So, I don't worry about that not getting the jokes.  But, um, yeah, it's just too much bad news I think.
R:  Yeah.  It's a lot of bad news and it's also a lot of like I'm not believing what I'm hearing on the news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like especially with respect to the war in Iraq --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that sorta thing, when seventy five percent of the United States citizens are for the war and I know that's not true and it just makes me so angry to hear it when I don't believe it at all that I'd rather just not.
L:  Yeah.  It's very frustrating.  And I live in a very, um [MN], conservative area, you know, where -- Bush lived here, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so it's like everything he says is the gospel, which is really frustrating [LAUGH] for me 'cause I don't believe him and, um, that's what -- that's all I hear and if you don't believe in that you're totally unpatriotic and -- and, uh, un-American and it's -- I just don't think that's true.  But the news is all slanted that way.  The, uh, one newspaper we had in town forced the other one out of business and they do whatever, you know, the politicians tell 'em to do and, uh, it's just -- and any time I listen to news, um, like even on C.N.N. sometimes, I mean, headline news you'll find people just giving their opinions.  These guys are supposed to be reporting.  Instead they're giving us their opinions and I don't think there's a place for that.  But I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Another thing that really turned us off was the really heavy anti French sentiment 'cause my husband is French and we were constantly hearing on the news basically like what a horrible person he is and how horrible all of his countrymen are and how anyone who's even like drinking French wine or eating French cheese is unpatriotic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm not going to say that I'm a patriot, but I don't feel like I should be attacked --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- either.
L:  Oh, I'm definitely a patriot, but that doesn't mean I can't have my own opinions and that my opinions are any better or worse than somebody else's just 'cause they wear a flag around themselves all the time, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's the same thing with, um, Iraqi citizens who came over here to get away -- I- Iranian citizens that came over here, anybody Arabic that comes over here has a hard time 'cause they're just painted with the same brush --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and God, it's frustrating 'cause there's nothing -- there's nothing I can do about it personally except for just say when someone says something in a group, you know, just kinda bring up the fact that not all people are a certain way.  Of course, I'm doing that constantly since I'm Jewish anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I am too.
L:  Don't you find you always have to say no, we're not all that way?  If we're all rich where's mine?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Totally.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really annoying.  But what can you do?  Hey, we control the media, why don't we do something about it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Seriously.  It makes me wish that the stereotypes --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- would sure have because I would love to be a rich Jew who controls the media.
L:  Wouldn't that be?  Hey, I don't know.  So, what else?  It's so funny they would pick two of us that have similar tastes -- I mean, opinions.
R:  Well, the last time I did this I was also speaking to someone -- oh, we ended up -- I don't remember what exactly -- oh, it was bio terrorism --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and like the people who I meet almost never agree with me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I actually was talking to someone who was like wow, I agree with you.  I was like oh, I'm so glad I'm not gonna have to spend ten minutes giving a speech then.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I -- I run into very few people who -- even my parents don't agree with me on so many of these issues, these world issues.
R:  Neither do mine and like my father is pretty liberal for a rich Canadian Jew.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, he's a member of the A.C.L.U., like card carrying member and everything --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and he was still for the war and I was floored by that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like well, if I have to give a speech to you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm gonna have to give a speech to everyone.
L:  You're kidding.  Uh, disappointing.  [LAUGH]  No.  Mine -- mine are both republicans, which is -- you know, we just don't talk politics in our house and all my other relatives that come to visit I just warn them, you know [LAUGH], don't talk politics 'cause you won't agree with them and then they'll just go they're what, you know, like they're -- what do you call it? -- um, traitors.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, yeah, most of my relatives were very pro the war.  But I didn't believe any -- I mean ...
R:  What?  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you.
L:  Even most of my relatives that were democrats were, uh, for the war.  But I -- I -- even when I heard it didn't prove to me that there were any kind of missiles there at all that we had to worry about.  What do they call 'em, weapons of mass destruction?  Have they found anything yet?
R:  No.  Now they're saying well, of course we're not going to find them because, um, they've had so many yeas to hide them, but that doesn't mean they're not there --
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  -- and we'll ...
L:  That's incredible.
R:  Well, that's your government at work.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, dear.  No.  I didn't vote for him.  It's not my government.  No.  I can't say that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] as much as I'd like to.  Well, I'd kinda like to -- I'd like it if we got the same, um, C.N.N. type news that the rest of the world gets 'cause from what I can tell it's different.  I think things are slanted differently towards the U.S. market and -- and that's how we're treated, like a market not -- not people who have to be informed.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the news is very different in the United States because when you watch the news in other countries they show very long stories.  It's not like a snippet and a sound bite here and there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They actually show an entire story with background and it's usually not as opinionated.  They give you a chance to form your own opinions and they don't show as many of those human interest stories like oh, boo hoo, woman is handicapped and walk -- can't walk up her stairs kind of like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, you know, uh, Channel Seven on your side stuff --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause it's not news.
L:  Well, they, um -- they assume that the people who are watching are intelligent and our people assume that we're not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that we're, you know, all this low -- lowest common denominator kinda thing and we have to be hand fed the truth with a capital T., whatever they decide that is, and, uh, we can't -- we're not, you know, capable of making -- making up our own minds.  That's very, um, annoying, which is another reason I just don't watch it and it -- it's just -- I don't know -- I don't know what else to say about it.  It's just frustrating and there's, um, nothing I can really do about it except keep an open mind.
R:  Yeah.  I think --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- if you're gonna watch the news at all you really have to watch it and say to yourself -- like, I have to learn how to separate fact from fiction or fact from opinion and then you get more out of it.
L:  And hopefully if you have kids do the same thing with them.  You know, if the kids are watching the news make sure they think too because so many people are into this don't question authority thing, which I am so totally against.  I like that bumper sticker that says, "Question authority" 'cause you should.  You should al- always question the facts.  Where were these facts derived from, you know?  And I don't think our children are -- are brought -- I know my nieces and nephews aren't -- they just sit in front of the T.V. and watch whatever comes on and it's the gospel.  They don't question, uh, what they hear, what they learn in school.  When I bring up, you know, the other point and say well, here's the information I had and blah, blah, blah, they'll go oh, really?  Well, yeah.  You can actually research things on your own and find out the truth on your own.
R:  I wonder how it's become such that people don't question what they hear though 'cause I'm sure there must've been a time when people read the newspaper and they were like oh, please, come on!
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  It -- a kind of laziness.  It's easier to just accept what everybody else is accepting, you know?  Don't rock the boat, everything's going fine kinda thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  It's disappointing 'cause if people were like that at the very beginning we wouldn't have this country.
