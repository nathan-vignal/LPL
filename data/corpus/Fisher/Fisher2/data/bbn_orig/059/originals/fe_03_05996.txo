R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how are you?  My name is Jacquie.
R:  Hi Jacquie, I'm Anna.
L:  Hi Anna, nice meeting you.
R:  Nice to meet you as well.
L:  Okay, um I didn't quite hear what they said.  I know something about the business world.  Did you get to hear what they said?
R:  I did.  They said, um, please describe how each of you feel about affirmative action being used as -- in hiring practices in the business world.
L:  Right.  Um, well, would you like to go first?
R:  Sure.  I will.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think affirmative action -- I think a lot of groups have been under -- under represented for too long.  And I think that a lot of the people who are in power would continue to under represent a lot of groups.  And I think that needs to change.  And --
L:  I --
R:  -- [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm sorry.  I agree with you.  I just wanted to say I agree with you.
R:  Okay.  And I think that unless -- I think  a lot of people would continue to under represent minorities, and women, and people of different religions and races, and people who had, um, who identified themselves sexually different, if, um they weren't forced to.  And I think sometimes it's good to force people to accept people who are different.  Because they are pigs[?] otherwise.  [LAUGH] And -- 
L:  I agree.
R:  -- and sometimes when you force people to do something that they, you know wouldn't necessarily think to do on their own, it opens their eyes.
L:  Definitely.  I agree with you one hundred percent.  And, you know I worked in a couple of jobs; I was in one job for about fifteen years and I got pregnant.  And when I left, when I came back from maternity leave, they had someone else in my position.  They liked her better because she was from their area, which was Staten Island.  So, they actually called me in and they told me I was fired.  When I came back it was a big plan that they all had, and I couldn't believe that I went down to the human resources department and I -- I filed a little claim, claiming, uh, you know, something about my pregnancy that that was illegal what they did.  And they ended up keeping me there and then, uh, in the job itself there was a lot of firings.  And those people -- even the big bosses that conspired against me, actually they got fired.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, eve- even a person being pregnant is also, you know treated --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- differently --
R:  I totally agree.
L:  So, I -- 
R:  I totally agree.
L:  -- I do agree.  Yeah, I do agree with affirmative action.  Um, because, you know everybody has their right to, you know -- you know, get -- get what they have to get.
R:  Yeah.  And I think that there is so many people who have been, you know, I mean, I think a  lot of people bring up their children in a really positive way, but I think a lot of people still bring up their kids to think that people are created in an unequal way.  And --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- I think that, you know, in some ways it's the job and the duty of the people who know better, to balance that out and to say, you know what, we need to talk to these people and say that it's not cool.  And we just need to make sure that in hiring practice especially, that everybody gets a fair shot.  And, you know, I mean, of course people's, you know, qualifi- qualifications and their personality and what their aptitude for the job should always be taken into consideration.  But I always think it will but of course, you know, people should never be discriminated against.  But I think everybody, you know, especially people -- minority groups and women and, you know, women with -- I -- they consider pregnancy to definitely be a disabling factor, especially when you return to the workforce after a pregnancy.  It's hard to re enter into the workforce after a pregnancy.  And you need to be given, you know, sort of a -- a, you know, little bit of a break for -- to a certain extent.  Like, you need to be given just a little nudge forward --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- just through society and it, you know --
L:  Right.  I agree with you.  And even when you go for a job and, you know, you do have, you know, you have certain high class people and they're interviewing you and everything, they may not like you for the -- you may have the qualifications, but for the littlest thing.  Not even speaking about black, white, green --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- red, women, men, whatever; they just might not -- actually, say you're dressed a certain way, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you do dress nice for the job or whatever.  What if they just don't like maybe how your nails are done?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe you have a certain type of -- you went to the manicurist and he did a fancy nail thing.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  For Christmas, you put maybe candy canes on your nails.  It just happened --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to be just the littlest thing they may not like.  They're not even thinking about your resume or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anything like that.  They're just thinking about --
R:  It's just a little tick.
L:  -- well, you know, I really don't like her nails.  If she's that, you know, crazy with her nails, she must be, like, crazy in her life too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm going to have trouble with this employee.  You know, they judge.  Like, if I was a boss, I would go on the merits of their resume --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of how they sound.  Okay, so if they have a funny looking earrings that I may --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not agree with, that doesn't really mean anything.  You know what I mean?
R:  No. 
L:  So, that -- that's --
R:  No.
L:  -- what I'm trying to say.  I don't like the way, you know, when you walk into a place and you try to get the job or whatever -- even if it's a fifty thousand dollar job.  You -- you might have bought the best suit; a five hundred dollar suit, best shoes, everything.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the best [inaudible] big -- everything.  But the littlest thing is your nails or your earrings, or you might have did some mistake you're not even aware of.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe the lipstick was too dark or something.  And, you know, they -- right away you're not hired because of that.
R:  Definitely. 
L:  They -- and, you know, they -- they look right through you.  They're not even, like, looking at your resume, or thinking about, you know, what I'm doing.  It's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, so, you know what I mean?  So --
R:  They've already eliminated you as soon as you --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- walk in through the door. 
L:  Maybe they don't like -- maybe you remind them of, you know, childhood friend.  You ne- -- you never can tell.
R:  No.
L:  Or a childhood enemy for that matter.
R:  Definitely.  Definitely.
L:  You know, so th- that's the -- that's the only thing I wanted to say.  So, you know, it's -- it's good for us to talk.  I mean, we don't know each other.  You sound --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like a really nice person --
R:  Oh, you too.
L:  -- yeah, and to make a -- have a, you know, just over the phone for ten minutes and to make a few extra dollars, that's not bad at all.
R:  No.  I know.  I'm happy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's interesting to see what other people's reactions are too at the topics. 
L:  Ver- very interesting.  Actually I thought it was a trick when I first called.  I was, like, is this a trick?  Like, are you going to, like -- like try to get my credit card information or something?  And do something with the phone bill?  You know, you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- always think everything's a trick, you know.
R:  I know.  There's too many scams out there.
L:  Definitely.  
R:  There are way too many scams.  My husband thought it was a scam as well.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I didn't even tell him yet.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He -- I'll tell -- I'll tell him later this evening.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'll be, like, I don't think it was a scam.  Everything seemed on the up and up so far.  [LAUGH]
R:  It isn't.  It's through the University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Yeah, that's what I thought.  That's --
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  -- what I -- and that's what I thought.  But, you know, they give you one topic for ten minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ten -- ten minutes seems like a really long time for the one topic.
R:  But it goes by really fast.  This is my third time doing it.
L:  Oh, it is?
R:  And so -- 
L:  Oh, that's fantastic.
R:  This is my last time doing it.
L:  Oh, you're allowed to do it three times?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, 'cause that's what I asked, and they said, "Yeah, well, if we need you again, we call you back".
R:  And so it goes --
L:  Y- you know, we call you back again.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, like, in f- four to six weeks they send you, like, a money order or something.
R:  Yeah, it goes by really fast.
L:  So, that's not -- that's not bad.  Who can't use an extra thirty dollars for dinner, you know?
R:  I know.  Totally.
L:  Right.
R:  It's a little bit of fun money or something.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Buy an extra pair of capris for the summer or something.
R:  I know.  So, fun,
L:  So, yeah, I thought -- I thought it was a very good conversation.  I still think it is and, um, I do believe actually in affirmative action because if there wasn't that, the bosses could just go crazy.  I'm just hiring --
R:  They really could.
L:  -- yeah, I'm just hiring, like, my type of person.  Um, it -- this person has to fit totally in my category.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This person has to live here, carry the same exact suitcase I have, have the same exact suit I have.  And with affirmative action, they're forced to hire who they don't want to hire.  And that's good.  I think that's a good think actually.  
R:  I do too.  I -- in some ways I really think it is because I think it opens peoples minds up to, uh, to- -- a totally different way of looking at the world.
L:  Definitely.
R:  I think that they wouldn't have done it before.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I think it's a --a way of -- of seeing the world that is -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that is new to a lot of people.  I think a lot of old, white men really wouldn't have seen -- though -- are seeing the world through new eyes because of affirmative action.  I think --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- that's a really good thing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's very good.  I -- I so agree wit that.  And, you know, the thing is, what happens with these companies?  Does the federal government regulate them?  Do they get, like, a letter -- does the top boss get a letter; you have to hire, you know, this amount of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they can't be, like, one hundred percent white, rich people.  You know, you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have to -- or d- -- are they like monitored?   'Cause I think it would be a good thing if they are monitored.
R:  They are monitored.  And they do get -- it's a part of a tax, their taxes --
L:  I see.
R:  -- the taxes that they receive.  And it's sort of a tax break actually that they get by -- by, um, choosing to participate in affirmative action.  And I know that lately that real legislation, the real controversy has been over affirmative action.  And that, um, universities, which I also think is very important because I think a lot of people are left out of the university system because of the, you know, the admissions process is so stringent.  And it leaves out so many people because they just don't have the opportunities because they don't go to the right schools in the right neighborhoods and the right, you know what I mean?  I mean --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- there is just such a, you know, there's such a disparity between the kids who go to schools in Manhattan, and the kids who go to schools in the Bronx.  Do you know what I mean?
L:  Definitely.
R:  And so you have this, you know, you have this change that happens when you -- when you have to say to people -- you have to treat everybody, you know, you have to --
L:  De- definitely.
R:  -- you have to take that into consideration every single time.  
L:  And when they're right out of college, you know, they just get --
