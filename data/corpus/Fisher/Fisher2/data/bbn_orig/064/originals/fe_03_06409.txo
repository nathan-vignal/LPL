L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  [MN] I'm Diane.
R:  Oh, I'm Laurie, how are you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Tough topic, huh? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  I don't know where you're located at.
R:  Um, I'm in the Midwest, in Indiana. 
L:  You're in Indiana.  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Okay.  Well, you're pretty close then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  But I don't think we have much to worry about.
R:  I don't really either, I think --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ah, I think we're kinda out in the country and --
L:  The bigger cities are -- are the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- problems.
R:  Yeah, I think so, too.  Um, but, you know, I -- I do have to say, like, when September eleventh was going on and my first instinct was to run and get my kids, 'cause they were at school, so --
L:  Yeah, you have, yeah --
R:  Um --
L:  -- school, yeah, they've done that with schools. 
R:  Yeah, that -- that would be my first instinct even now [inaudible] --
L:  Even local people. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's -- it's maybe not always the correct one, because sometimes they're safer --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause they fill it up but, um, you know, that was my first instinct, but I did pick up the phone and they had everything locked down anyway, so you couldn't get on it --
L:  Yeah, that's what I say, they -- they -- they do it a little different now, I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have any children, but I've heard they lock everything down.
R:  Yeah, it's really different world than it used to be. [LAUGH] And, um, even in when I grew up, it's really a different world now, so ... But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I mean, I think I would be pretty calm.  I was -- I was pretty calm on that day and I think I would do what had to be done and then break down later. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, after initial shock is over.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  And, um, you know, i- if I was in a position I would try to help people and if it, you know, was -- it was nearby or something, where I could go help them, I would try to help 'em out, but, ah, I don't know, I think like you said, I don't think we're in a lot of danger where we are.  I think we're probably okay. 
L:  Yeah, [COUGH] and the only thing we have around here -- we do have an, ah, airport and airbase.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a small one.
R:  Right.
L:  But still it's an airport.  And then it's a military airbase.
R:  Right.
L:  They do just basically training there --
R:  Well, that could --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- just the idea, you know, it's not that far away. 
R:  Yeah, oh, I know there's, like, a nuclear power plant over in Ohio that's not too too far from us.  I don't know if, um, if it would actually reach over this far if something happened, but, you know, it's possible.  I kinda -- every once in a while I kinda worry about that, but ...
L:  Oh, I'm, like, maybe fifteen miles from it.
R:  Oh, you're real close. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ten miles. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  But I think they --
L:  I mean, the planes --
R:  -- probably --
L:  -- go over, I -- you know, they're --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's kinda scary.  Well, and, you know, I also think that they probably have things like that pretty secured.  I think if another --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- attack comes, it's going to be somewhere where we're not going to expect it.  So, and I do live -- I live about thirty five minutes from Indianapolis and I think, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, the Indie five hundred race is this weekend and they're going to have two former presidents are going to be there and so, you know, that's kinda scary.
L:  Yeah, you're -- you're close --
R:  And --
L:  -- to a lot of things.
R:  Yeah, and I know there's been some threats and, um, but, I mean, it's far enough away that I think, you know, bomb or anything is not going to really affect us, um -- [NOISE] my daughters are fighting. [LAUGH] 
L:  Is that what that is?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, they have to learn to live with each other. 
R:  Oh, my-- well --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't know what they're doing, but when one is trying to out shout the other one so ...
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess that'll happen. 
R:  Yeah, yeah, they're six and nine, so ... [LAUGH] Sometimes they're best buddies and sometimes they hate each other. [LAUGH] But, um, but, yeah, it makes me kinda sad because the world's changed so much for them and things are so different than they were when I was a kid, so ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  So, one of 'em -- one of them's really got the other one going. [LAUGH] Their dad'll go in and straighten them out. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, sometimes -- don't -- it -- it helps. 
R:  Yeah, well, I've only got two.  It sounds like ten but [LAUGH] there's just two of them in there.  So now, did you have children and they're grown or ...?
L:  No, I just never had children.
R:  Just never had children.  Well, there's, you know, something to be --
L:  Just had a lot of nieces and nephews. 
R:  Oh, that's fun.  I always loved being an aunt.  You can, you know, do so many fun things with them and, um, you don't have the responsibility. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, send them home. 
R:  Yeah, exactly.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, [LAUGH] yeah, this is a tough topic today.  I heard that they had a topic the other day about hobbies.  I was, like, I wish I had had time to call in that day, 'cause that sounded like a fun topic.
L:  Yeah, it did.  
R:  So easy to talk about and everything, so ...  Some of them are real doozies[?]. [LAUGH] So, I always wonder what they're thinking when they listen to the recordings, do you? [LAUGH] 'Cause sometimes the conversation get kinda off track, so ...
L:  Yeah, a little bit.  
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  Like I said, we only have the airbase but it's a --
R:  Yeah, we, ah --
L:  -- small one.  But --
R:  We really don't have anything real, real close other than, you know, like I said, Indianapolis is about thirty five minutes to the west of me, but, um --
L:  The only big city that's near us that would have anything would be Cleveland. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's about an hour and a half away --  
R:  Yeah, it's, like, far enough away --
L:  -- from here.
R:  -- that you're not too --
L:  So, yeah.
R:  -- worried about it and -- but, you know, I do go to the city every once in a while, so I guess I shouldn't be so blase about it, 'cause, you know, and, um, and I did worry a little bit.  We went to Disneyworld over Christmas and, you know, I kind of stopped for a minute and went "Ew, you know, wouldn't that be a perfect time to attack with all the visitors".  And then I thought, "But you can't let -- you can't be so scared that you don't live your life".
L:  Right.
R:  Because that's exactly what they want.
L:  Yep.
R:  So ...  Um, I just kinda, you know, put it out of my mind and went anyway, 'cause, you know, it could happen anywhere, so ...  But, um, it's definitely a different world. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I guess there's -- we do have good security.
R:  Yeah, I think so, I think, um, I feel pretty safe for the most part, but, you know, they can't ever protect you from everything. 
L:  No, no, you --
R:  And I think that kinda hit home on nine eleven.
L:  That was --
R:  You know.
L:  -- unexpected, using the airs- --
R:  Yeah, it --
L:  -- u- u- u- using --
R:  -- really was.
L:  -- the air traffic. 
R:  Well, I mean, and -- and -- and very shocking 'cause I also thought that the security was better than that, to think they could hijack that many planes is just beyond my comprehension.  And, um, sc- -- you know, really scary, but, you know, obviously that probably won't ever happen again because they're watching that now and they've got certain things that they're watching, but I think, you know, they could do little things that, you know, would create havoc.
L:  Well, now they're the -- I don't think we're -- I don't think we're going to get so much any more.  If they were starting on other countries in the Middle East --
R:  Yeah, and oversea- -- and our -- our things overseas. 
L:  Up in -- up in, ah, ah, France and Britain?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's, um --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- that's scary and, you know, that -- it's scary for them too, and -- and, um, I'm not sure, you know, if France really has the capability to do the security like we do, 'cause they're a lot smaller country, so ...
L:  I think a little more lenient. 
R:  Yeah, I think so too, and, um, you know, we'll -- [MN] course maybe if something happened, they would be forced to change.
L:  Yeah, maybe not now, but the day -- they were a lot lenient in letting people through --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and not checking.  That was before nine eleven. 
R:  Yeah, hopefully they're a little bit better now.  So, I don't know, um, and I'm sure that it -- I know in England that they are, because my mom and dad went over there a couple of years ago.  My mom said at the time, she said, "The security was much more stringent than ours".
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was before, you know, everything happened over here and she was, you know, surprised at how long it took 'em to get through and everything.  So, um, you know, I think they're probably even tighter now, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I think that -- that -- that one's probably pretty safe as far as airplanes and stuff, but I don't know, it's scary and --
L:  The only thing I worry about is Canada.
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  And what's going on up, you know, in --
R:  Oh, with the SARS and everything?
L:  Well, not that -- it -- you know, if they decide to pick on them.
R:  Oh, well, in, um, the border is so large that, you know, not all -- not every -- not every little speck of it can be guarded and, you know, people could slip through that way, but --
L:  Yeah, that's what I say, that's --
R:  Yeah, but I mean, there's -- there's so many people already in the country who are connected with, you know, with the terrorist organizations, that if they, you know, if they really wanna do something, they'll figure out a way to do it.  But I just don't think they'll be able to do it on a scale that they did before.  You know, that would be little -- little things, which isn't good either but -- but I think you're right, I think they're going to attack overseas where, you know, we're more vul- vulnerable than we are here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they can, you know, do the d- -- like the bomb that just went off in Saudi Arabia at the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- apartments.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things like that, you know.  Where they --
L:  Well, that was suicide bombings with --
R:  Yeah, yeah, they still did a lot of damage, though, and, you know, I don't know, I don't understand those people. [LAUGH]  So, now which part of Ohio are you in?  You said you're pretty close to Cleveland.
L:  Northeast. 
R:  Okay, I have an aunt that lives in --
L:  Up by Cleveland.
R:  And, ah --
L:  About an hour and a half away.
R:  I have an aunt that lives in Canton, so ...
L:  That's about an hour and a half the other direction. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, okay.  That's a really nice area, I like that town, so ...  We like to go visit her there.  But it's a good four or five hour drive for us, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's a pretty good distance.
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  And I think, you know, she kinda lives in a small town so she probably doesn't worry about that stuff too too much either. 
L:  Well, they have that big airport down there.
R:  Yeah, that's true, they do.  They do.  And they have that football hall of fame out.  I don't know if that would be a target or not --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but it could be.
L:  Maybe not. 
R:  [LAUGH] You never know.  But, um, but, yeah, I was kinda worried about the five hundred race this weekend 'cause, um, there's a lot of celebrities and that would be, you know, if they wanted to do something big, that would be the place to do it.  And our cops are threatening to strike [LAUGH] 'cause they didn't get their pay increase they wanted, so ... [LAUGH] It's like, "Please don't do that right now.  This is not a good time". [LAUGH]
