L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Tonya.
R:  I'm Leehar[?].
L:  Nice to meet you.  Um, Leehar?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, that's a nice name.
R:  Thanks.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Um, Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.  I'm in the San Francisco area.
R:  Oh, no way!  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought it was a local study.  I was, like, oh, my gosh.
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's so amazing.
L:  I talked to somebody from Michigan last week.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  So -- I've gotten a few other phone calls but I had company or something so I wasn't able to take them.
R:  Mm.  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, mhm.
R:  Oh, that's +good, cool.
L:  Yeah.  It's real nice.  What do you do in Michigan?
R:  Um, oh, in Philly?
L:  In Philly, I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Der!  
R:  [LAUGH] I'm, um, I -- I coordinate programs for young people.
L:  Oh.  Do you like it?
R: Yeah, yeah I do.  I do.  What do you do?
L:  [MN] Uh, I work for, uh, the water company here.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I do, uh, budgets -- budgets and rates sort of stuff.
R:  Oh, wow!  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  Sort of boring number crunching.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's still cool in San Francisco.  I've heard great things about the city.
L:  It's a great place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Philly's a great place too.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  It needs work.  I mean, I love the city because I grew up in it. But at the same it's, like, I could -- I could -- I could be objective and say it needs a little more work but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're getting there.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it -- my overall impression of it when I -- when I was there was sort of grimy.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.
L:  It had a grime to it that ... maybe California cities don't have.
R:  No.  No.
L:  But, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Philly's a lot older.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  So, okay, on to the topic of -- w- I guess we should say the world terrorism.
R:  I know.
L:  Um, the question was, would --
R:  Would we --
L:  -- we remain calm. Yeah well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it depends on what the attack was.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, if we- -- it depends on was it down my street --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or was it in New York City.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know? [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that makes a -- I think just it makes a huge difference as to whether someone's calm or not.
R:  Sure, sure.  When, like, when -- were you in San Francisco when, um, the September eleventh happened?
L:  Yes.
R:  Wow!  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  So, it was a little kind of removed, like --
L:  It was very removed.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Yeah, very removed.  It was just more like, "Oh, my God" you know, "Whoa" and not any sort of panic.
R:  Mm.  Okay.
L:  Per se.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, the way --
L:  So ...
R:  -- the way I heard about it was, like, I heard it had happened in the morning --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I was kinda sad.  So, I wasn't panicked, I was sad.  And then when in mid afternoon, like, they evacuated schools in Philadelphia, because I was in one, because they wanted everyone to go home.  And so that made me a little panicked.  I was, like, "Wait a second" 'cause then, like, they're bombing us everywhere because I guess, like, um, Pittsburgh there was a plane and then, um, DC -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so, along the east coast I think, like, there was this -- maybe it was -- it shouldn't have happened like that but there was a sense of, like, you know, you gotta be careful, like, it's not just New York.
L:  Yeah.  But that's different from all out panic.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, that concern or high anxiety I think is a lot different than panic.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, panic is when you're running around blind, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- going crazy, not really doing anything constructive or, you know, freaking out.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  I think that's totally different than -- you know, I think you had an obviously good reason to have high anxiety but I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doesn't sound like you were panicked.
R:  No, no.  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think, yeah ...
L:  I mean, that's a b- -- go ahead.
R:  Oh, no, no.  I was, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, it -- it -- it's a heartbreak i- -- if you, like, if you were in that building.  But do --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you think that you would be panicked, like ...
L:  If I was in -- if I had been in the World Trade Center?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I definitely would have been panicked.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I definitely would have been panicked.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And yet -- but, you know, I -- I'm guessing that.  But a -- a lot -- and then again, you know, th- th- -- from some of the stories we heard, there were people who remained calm under fire.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  You know, who got dow- -- who knew to walk on the right side of the stairs, who got their coworkers down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the stories of people who rescued ten people by saying, "Not this stairwell, it's broken; go this way" and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that sorts of things.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that ... I don't know, I -- I think sometimes people surprise themselves under pressure or under panic.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, in emergency situation.
R:  Mm.  [MN]
L:  So, but the way I heard about nine eleven was I wake up in the morning and my radio goes off to National Public Radio.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
L:  NPR; I'm a big NPR fan.
R:  Right.
L:  And so I heard them talking about this bombing as I woke up and I thought that it was a, um, war of the worlds reenactment for some reason.
R:  Mm.
L:  Thought it must be the anniversary of the war of the worlds and they're, like, you know, redoing it.  'Cause I'm asleep; I'm just waking up, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  And then I'm just, like, "No, that's not it" and I just -- I just ran -- I just jumped up out of bed and I ran to the TV.  I didn't even have my glasses on --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I turned on the television and, boom, there was the second plane crashing into the World Trade Center.
R:  Wow!
L:  [MN] So, I slept through the whole first bit.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, totally cr- --
R:  Yeah, that -- mm.
L:  Totally, totally craziness.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's like one of those things -- it's like a -- definitely a historical moment, like, "What were you doing when this happened?"  And --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pr- -- yeah, our par- -- I don't know how old you are but my parents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my parents' generation would say, you know, "Where were you when JFK got shot?"
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, it's, like, well, I wasn't born yet.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I guess, you know, you kind of think about too, like, when -- when you know, how do you +remember when Ronald Reagan, got shot?
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  You know, that -- that sort of an age def- defining moment too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty six.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  And you?
L:  I'm thirty four.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, you may not remember Ronald Reagan getting shot?
R:  Vaguely.  
L:  Y- --
R:  But not --
L:  You might be just a little too young.
R:  -- not clear.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  All I remember back from there -- I remember him getting shot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But do you know, I -- when I was little, I think I was in the fifth grade or something, fourth grade, when he got shot.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I was still little and I though Washington, DC was in Washington State.
R:  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] It made perfect sense to me.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  And when I found out that Washington DC was clear on the other side of the country just seems -- I'd always pictured it so t- -- much closer.
R:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.  I know, I know.  Yeah definitely is a -- is one of those things where, um, like, especially when you're young, all these moments are, like, kind of fuzzy.  Like, I'm sure, like, my brother when he was watching the footage; like, I was totally, like, kind of, like, "Oh, my gosh, you know, I can't believe this is happening", right.  But then they're, like, "Oh, it's interrupting my cartoons".  Like, I didn't really sink in, like --
L:  Right.  That --
R:  -- to what was happening.
L:  -- that it was a major thing.
R:  Yeah.  It was, like, come on now let -- you know, it, like, it was just, like, "Oh, my g-" and them I'm trying to tell them, "Look, it's a huge scary thing that is happening right now" you know, and --
L:  Do you think that, um -- do you think, like, you know, like, right now in the next couple of days they say is the highest, um, probability for some terrorist ale- -- something to happen?
R:  Really?
L:  Does that -- yeah, 'cause we're at orange alert.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I just heard on the news at t- -- like, today and tomorrow are the highest alerts for something to happen --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to pass on bad news.
R:  Oh, no, no, no.  No, I mean, --
L:  But did that make you change your pl-
R:  -- I -- I -- I've been hearing this throughout the whole year.  Mhm.
L:  And does that make you -- it doesn't affect me at all.  Like, I don't feel, like, any more anxiety or, like, you know, if something happens it's going to happen -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I can't, like, sit here and be anxious over it.  I'm just going to live my life.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, and I'm certainly be aware of, like, packages or anything but I'm not going to let it make me anxious per se.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I think if yo- -- if you take it -- if it's -- your number's up your number's up.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And this -- it's really scary that the government somehow knows that today and tomorrow are [LAUGH] they -- how did they get this information but they don't know the other specifics about it?  And -- and that --
L:  Right.  Well, they know there is increased kinds of chatter through this system that Al Qaeda uses --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, and it was s- -- is similar in pattern to the increase in chatter across the lines before nine eleven.
R:  Oh, [inaudible] --
L:  So, they re looking at a specific -- they're looking at a pattern of increased communication, though they may not know exactly what's going on.
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause things are in code or, you know, whatever.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:   So ... 
R:  Yeah. [inaudible] 
L:  This -- so, that's how they kinda, um, that's how they kind of at.
R:  Mm, Mhm.
L:  They -- they probably know a lot of stuff we don't.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I'm sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe twenty f- -- maybe twenty years from now it will all come out and we'll go, "Whoa, we didn't know we were that close to, you know --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- the world being blown up".
R:  Yeah.  I'm surprised that they, um -- they're letting people know.  I'm -- I'm wondering what's the reason for that?  Like --
L:  Letting people know that -- that the --
R:  -- um, that, you know, we're on high alert.  'Cause is that supposed to make people -- o- obviously not -- not [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yes.  It -- well, and not only for citizens to be aware of things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but also for, um, the police, ah, fire, emergency, all the emergency operations --
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  -- things to be in place.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And then it's also for the airlines to have higher security, hyper vigilance --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- um, that sort of thing.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that's what that's about.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, it really is important to, like, let -- let, you know, so maybe if the -- it's on high alert the chief of police doesn't take a vacation the next couple of days.  He stays in town just in case.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, it's that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, people are prepared and they're ready for something just in case.
R:  Mhm, mm. 
L:  I think it's pretty wise.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And just better security too.  Like here -- I don't know about what they do in Philly, but here in San Francisco the -- they -- they have extra patrols on the Bay bridge and the Golden Gate bridge --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um, 'cause they're, you know, major landmarks.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, I don't know if you guys have anything like that in Philly.
R:  Yeah, they block- -- they blocked the Liberty Bell for a while and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I -- I keep on thinking, I'm, like, what kind of symbolic -- oh, I mean, like, there's symbolic thing, you know, to destroying the be- bell but it's just kinda, like, so -- so sad that, like, why have they gone to this, you know, to -- to raise the firm level awareness.  You know, are they of -- I mean, the -- they're doing it for a reason and, like, yeah, there has to be other ways of, like, showing your grievance without hurting, um, other people, so ...
L:  Yeah --
