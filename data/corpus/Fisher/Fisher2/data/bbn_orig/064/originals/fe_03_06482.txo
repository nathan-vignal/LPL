R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Nicole.
R:  Hi, I'm Sharon.
L:  Hi, Sharon.
R:  How are you? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm doing all right.  Just got home from work. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know what you mean.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, the very int- -- it's a very interesting topic for today ... 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- about --
L:  So, do you bel- --
R:  I'm sorry, excuse me?
L:  So, do you think they should be televised?
R:  Do I think?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ... I -- I guess ... 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's fine but, you know, of course when we would not be the -- the spectators or audience we would not be, uh, juror so I guess it really wouldn't matter what we thought but it is very entertaining if nothing else.
L:  Yeah.  I think it -- it would be a problem because we are potential jurors for other cases.
R:  Mhm mhm.
L:  And once you see -- start seeing stuff on TV over and over again.  Maybe not the same trial.  You start developing serial types.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Y- well, I w- --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, I worked in a law related area so, I don't know, I guess I just sorta look at things -- like at each case individually --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, um, you know, but certainly, sure you could, um, you know, draw certain inferences, uh, you know, just by watching, you know, one and sort of apply it to others.
L:  Well, like the Court TVs like they have on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- right now.  I've heard several people who are, like, addicted to that show --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and gotta get home ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to hear about some -- some crime that happened when we were kids or something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's now Court TV.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  It's --
R:  Well, you know, I guess it's just a reality may- -- the reality TV --
L:  [inaudible] right.
R:  -- phenomenon now.  I mean, everything has to be ... 
L:  The voyeurism of it?
R:  -- I mean, we have to be spectators and -- and everything that goes on and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and have like an active interest in it.  Or play an active role it in so I guess that's part of it but I guess the most famous one that I could think of, of course, was O.J. Simpson --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh --
L:  Well --
R:  -- you know, trial and -- and how public that really became.
L:  Oh, that was a crazy old circus.  [inaudible] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you got people getting in arguments and stuff over --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- a court trial. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, yes.  That was --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- a very controversial trial and a lot -- you're right, it did -- it did spar a lot of arguments.  A lot of arguments.
L:  I just think that stuff should just be in the court.  It doesn't really need to be ... public.  I mean, they have seating in there.  It's not like it's hidden.  You can go and see it if you want to.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But it ... uh, I mean, putting it out there for the whole world to see, I just think will degrade us --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- that much more.
R:  And then also we -- you don't get a chance to see everything.  You only get a chance to see what the cameras are showing you because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot happens when the cameras aren't rolling --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so -- and a lot of those, um, discussions and rulings and things of that nature do greatly impact the outcome but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you're not there, you know, to s- -- to hear it for yourself, then you know, you're missing key information that needs to be factored into, you know, the ultimate, um, um, decision.  
L:  Right.
R:  So, I do know that.
L:  Yeah, y- they're not going to show you the grand jury part.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Or the -- the selection of the jury.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  They just wanna get straight to ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the blood and guts of it.
R:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
L:  And well, you know, you- you're looking at it as a ... a -- a very skew view of what's going on and you could be seeing something or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- taking something as fact and it's, you know ... like the -- those TV shows that you see on like, uh, like CSI and --
R:  Oh, yeah, mhm, mhm.
L:  -- not those [inaudible] like, The Practice or whatever, all the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they -- how they glamorize all this stuff.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I ... I think more money and entertainment dollars should be going on something that is not so reality based.
R:  Right.
L:  We're just getting caught up in watching everybody's business.
R:  Yeah, uh, yeah.  That's bas- -- but it's -- it's big money.  That's what people want.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, the --
L:  And, you know, the -- the -- the -- the thing of, uh, well that's what the public wants to see.  Well, you know, I want my kids to see something hoping --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I watch it every day but ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- I know there's other people in my community who wanna see whatever programs I'm watching as well but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they +disappear.
R:  Right, 'cause I know, I don't even watch -- to tell you the truth, I don't watch any of the reality TV.  I didn't even watch American Idol.  Um, I don't watch --
L:  Oh!  The thought!  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't watch -- I don't watch [LAUGH] any of those kind -- I don't watch any of those kinda shows.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I really -- I think I'm like the only person in America --
L:  Mm, [inaudible].
R:  -- that didn't watch American I- -- although I was familiar, you know, with it but, um, and -- and Rueben and Clay and -- I mean, of course, I -- it sounds like I did watch it but I just --
L:  No, no.  That's because the media was so on it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that you didn't have to watch it.
R:  Yep, yep, that's right.  That's right so I felt up to date quite honestly without having to watch it.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I really -- I felt up to date but, uh --
L:  I mean, it's on the sports talk radio and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what's happened now.  I'm like, wait, I thought I'm supposed to be listening about sports.  What -- why is American Idol on here?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know, I know.  But I tell you if -- you know, I -- I don't know.  It's just like we're ... I mean, as a -- as a culture, you know, we may be excluded from that but just as a culture we just enjoy the -- I don't know, the -- the real time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- events that -- that are going on.
L:  Instant gratification?  Right.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Right, exactly.
L:  Like --
R:  Exactly, yes.
L:  Like the other people who never even know that TV highlight [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh --
L:  Okay, Steve.  Steve's really that way.  I'm not really that, you know [inaudible].
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's true.
L:  I can understand that, you know, when you sit out on a hot day drinking your tea on the porch and watching the neighbors across the street argue.  No, I can -- I relate!
R:  Right, right. 
L:  But, uh [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, that's true.  Now, I do watch like Judge Judy and, uh -- and, uh, what's his name?  Um, [LIPSMACK] Joe Brown, I watch him.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I like Joe Brown, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um, so I do watch, you know, those -- those kinda court cases, I mean, 'cause actually they're pretty entertaining.  It's not ... real life, you know, like violent crime kind of a situation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, more than likely.  But I do watch those shows.  I think that they are very entertaining quite honestly.  But, um --
L:  Well, eh, if you think about it, those shows do -- yet they'll get their half an hour of fame --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but then people will forget about it right away, but the --
R:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely with those shows.
L:  -- the real court, that could be a life altering thing.  It's already a life altering thing being -- that you have to be at court --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for whatever crime and then the whole nation knows what you did.
R:  Right, exactly, exactly.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're airing your dirty laundry to, you know, to millions of people.
L:  And I mean, how -- and what if you're -- okay, you got some dirty laundry.  You're accused of murder and you're [inaudible] face is shown all over TV.  How you gonna fix your life when you're proven innocent per se?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Everybody's gonna look at you wondering, oh ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  Well, what I heard I think you should have been in jail, blah blah blah, whatever.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Because I mean, like, O.J.
R:  Exactly, yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, you got a lot of people think he's and a lot of people say he's not but the -- what they showed on TV didn't really leave you enough to go on so people were going with their gut feelings or whatever.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  And then that causes problem and he couldn't have a normal life for a whi- --
R:  No, he couldn't.
L:  -- well, you know, he is a celebrity but still --
R:  Yeah, no he couldn't.
L:  No matter what he did ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were on him worse than a -- a movie star.
R:  Yep, that's true.  That's very true and --
L:  And for a normal person who don't have money ... [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  That's right which is most of us.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Both of us.
L:  And if we're supposed to [inaudible] on TV ... oh, I couldn't even imagine.  No, I couldn't ... I don't think court -- all that stuff -- especially stuff that's happening right now.
R:  I know, yeah.
L:  I mean, if something happened a long time ago ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like on Court TV where they show a lot of old stuff but --
R:  Right, right.  Right, but you know, if I know kinds of, you know, cases fascinating but because I was in a law related profession and I used to attend trials and -- and -- and monitor trials, I know that there's so much that does go on, you know, from the very beginning with -- of a case to the end of a case --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that the -- that the cameras just don't pick up on when they're televising, you know, these kinds of events.  
L:  Right.
R:  And really I mean, uh, you know, a trial isn't just a snippet.  It's, you know, I mean, it has a beginning, a middle and an end --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all, you know, together with the -- with the evidence, um, you know, that's how the -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  -- a deci- -- that's how a verdict is rendered and not just by looking at little snippets.  And you know even with like the O.J. case and all those kind of high profile cases that are, um, televised, nobody sits th- -- well, most people can't sit down and watch the whole thing.  I mean, we work and, you know, we have other --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things, so you know, so we just watch, you know, little bits and pieces here and there and you --
L:  Sound bytes off the news.
R:  Right, and you can't really, you know m- -- you can't really pass judgment just by, you know, bits and pieces of information.  
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] And it's not fair to the person.  
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I know certainly if I were on trial [LAUGH] for something I wouldn't want, you know, somebody just to come in and out, you know, at their convenience and then, you know, try to render a verdict, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, for something that I've done.
L:  [inaudible].  E- I can [inaudible] that you'd be watching -- let's say they started showing Court TV real time; stuff that's happening today and then later down the line --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- perhaps you're gonna have audience voting, calling in like on American Idol.
R:  Oh, my g- -- 
L:  Ooh.
R:  You know what?  That could happen.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm -- do- --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- don't -- don't think it's so far fetched, I'm telling you!
L:  Oh, I'm not suppos- -- you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I -- like, that -- that bothered me that they wanted to show this stuff on TV.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then they --
