L:  My name is Renee.
R:  Hi, I'm Kimberley.
L:  Hi.  Have you watched any, um, trials on the show lately?  On TV?
R:  Uh, not real ones.  You know --
L:  Oh [inaudible] --
R:  -- just on shows and stuff.
L:  No, the only one I've watched ever was O.J. Simpson.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think everybody watched that one.  Um, I think they should be televised because, you know, people do such horrible crimes, I think it should be shown on TV so they'll feel bad about it.  If they have any conscience, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I've -- part -- part of me thinks, "Yeah, that'd be a good thing and then part of me thinks it wouldn't be" you know?
L:  Yeah, 'cause sometimes they have, like, the kids too.  They'll like see the coffee [inaudible] stuff, like, whatever they see on TV too so that's the bad side of it, I guess.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, you never know, you know, how some people are gonna take things. [LAUGH]
L:  No because some people don't have any ideas of how to do things and so they start talking about it on TV exactly what they did and stuff like that.
R:  [NOISE] And they decide they're gonna try it.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  And be crazy like the other people will. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think a lot of the shows end up doing that too, you know? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, yeah, really.  Uh.
R:  But --
L:  Gives people the wrong message.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know ... [NOISE] if that would be a good thing or not, you know?  Kind of --
L:  Uh-huh.  No, because, you know, some people can wind up coming up with ideas on their own wa- -- in their own minds anyways in doing it no matter what.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't ... I guess either way but I guess I still think they should have it on TV so -- so the whole world can see that person's face, you know, so whenever, you know, they're let free or something, you know, then people can say, "Oh, well, I remember you" you know?  And they shouldn't be able to live like a decent life, you know?  If they did something [NOISE] so horrendous, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they should always remember it, you know, because the family has to always remember it if their family was murdered or something, you know?
R:  The only thing I worry about is all the other people affected in the lives so ...
L:  Yeah.  No, for the family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on both sides, yeah.
R:  'Cause, you know, say your son did this, you know, well, you're on national TV ...
L:  Yeah, exact- --
R:  -- on a trial [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah, I mean, just because [inaudible] --
R:  The whole world knows them from then on.  You're branded, you know?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Definitely they always associate, you know, just because somebody in the family did something doesn't mean the whole family's bad either.
R:  Right, but a lot of people feel that, you know?
L:  Yeah, exactly, you know, and they'll start a -- like, you know, all their friends will leave the parent -- you know, the family and all that and want to have nothing to do with them.
R:  Right.
L:  Just because of one bad apple, you know?
R:  Yeah --
L:  So --
R:  -- I don't know whether -- you know, 'cause we -- especially kids watching.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That'd be a -- you know, a ha- -- it -- a lot of parents don't supervise their children's viewing habits at all, you know?
L:  Oh, exactly, yeah.  'Cause that's what they were talking about.  They were, like, on, um ... a while back they had that, um -- something happened in California I think.  The man ... was in the middle of the road on the highway with a gun on his head or something and it was shown on national TV like on the, um, kids channels and during kids programs and stuff like that.  And there was a big ruckus about that because they said the kids shouldn't a been able to see that kind of stuff.  I think he actually committed suicide and they were --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- showing it on TV and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  That's not a good thing.
L:  No.  They should have it like only on adult channels or ... maybe, you know, channels that kids can't access or something.
R:  Yeah, or at least very late viewing, you know?
L:  Yeah or, you know, if they wanna have the trials, at least late at night, you know, when the kids are in bed.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  So, well, you know, and they can all --
R:  Should be in bed anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.  You can usually hear 'em kinda whispering in the room, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're usually up and they're still in bed but not asleep.  But ...
R:  Yeah, I don't ... that's something I'm kinda torn on whether that would be a good thing or not.  I know I enjoy watching ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the shows like The Practice and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- things like that that are about trials, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't allow my children to watch them.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I'm too much, you know --
R:  So --
L:  -- you know, and then they get off on a bad idea.  There's enough problems going on in the world without adding that to it, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And one less thing for them to worry about.  Mm, they should be worried about being kids and not have to worry about all this other -- like, crimes and drama and all this stuff.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I [inaudible] ... that's a -- that'd be a hard decision to make, you know, whether that would be a good thing or not.  
L:  No.  I mean, if somebody does a crime they should just show them.  They shouldn't associate that person with his family.  I mean, that is his family but they shouldn't -- you know, they should have, um -- oh, what is it called?  Like, witness protection program or something --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for the family [LAUGH] you know?  It's like 'cause every time, you know, that they're on TV, you know, like, oh, that -- that person's family, you know, and he did something wrong and all that.  Well, I mean, you can't be responsible for what your, you know, family or kids does, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  I don't know.  Nowadays they are holding parents responsible for what their children do.  
L:  Yeah, that's what I've heard, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Especially like y- -- especially like if they're a truant in school or something.
R:  Right.
L:  I think it's sort of jail or something?
R:  It gets kinda scary sometimes[?].
L:  Yeah.  I guess they're like, I mean, do -- you would think once you dropped your kids off at school, you know, it's the school's responsibility to keep an eye on who's going where, you know?  'Cause most of the time in the school the kids can just wander wherever they want.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nobody keeps an eye on them.
R:  Don't they?
L:  Well, then it all winds up being the parents fault if they leave so ... I don't know.
R:  I mean ... it shouldn't be happening to begin with but, you know --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- like I said, some parents don't have the control they should have.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Definitely.
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  Well, luckily mine are still little so I don't have to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- worry about that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, third grade's the highest I'm at so far. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  So, hopefully, you know, things'll keep going smooth.
L:  No, really. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hopefully by the time they get in high school they're still playing tag and hide and seek, you know, and [LAUGH] just oblivious to the world, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] I doubt that's gonna happen. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Bags not anyway.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, really.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ...
R:  Yeah, it's a ...
L:  So, where are you calling from?
R:  I'm in Arkansas.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Michigan.
R:  In where?
L:  In Michigan.
R:  Michigan?
L:  Yeah.
R:  We got family up there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm originally from Louisiana.
R:  I knew you didn't sound Michigan. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I didn't think I still had an accent after all this time.  I only -- I've only been here three years so ... I haven't been here very long.
R:  Yeah, uh, well, I wasn't able to distinguish where the accent was from ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but you do have some of one.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Some people tell me -- I've been told once I do and I've been told before that I don't so I was like, "I don't know". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, you definitely sound different than a south sounds. [LAUGH]
L:  Well -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Well, maybe I'm getting a northern accent too where I [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, you got a little bit of mixture, you know?  I can hear ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- some of both, you know, 'cause --
L:  No, that's funny because you don't notice it, you know?  You just -- I guess you just kinda pick it up, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  In whatever [inaudible].
R:  Well, we had some family live up, um ... in Illinois for about four years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the youngest son ... was only about a year and a half when they moved up there ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he talks very northern.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh [inaudible] --
R:  And the baby that was born up there, uh ... she hadn't learned to talk very well yet before they moved back so she's not as bad as he is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But he --
L:  Huh!
R:  -- went to, like, his first year of kindergarten and stuff, you know, while he was up there.
L:  Oh, okay, that's why by being mixed up in school, okay.
R:  Right.
L:  I was gonna say, well, how did he get it from the parents?  Are they all pretty weird? [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, well, even the dad [NOISE] ... um, learned -- he picked up quite a bit of it, you know, working out, uh, with kids.  He'll [NOISE] you know, talk in more northern too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's funny, you know, how you adapt.
L:  Yeah, exactly, and you don't --
R:  What you're around.
L:  -- yeah, notice it.  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Different people and different accents and stuff.  But it's definitely different up here.  The people aren't as friendly as down south. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  We've noticed that, um, with our family, you know.
L:  Huh.
R:  They're -- they're just different, you know?
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
R:  They eat different, they -- you know, everything's different.
L:  Yeah, that's weird.  'Cause usually you know, I'm used to -- whenever I lived in the south going to the stores, you know, if you went to the store you knew everybody's family, whether they're a saint or not, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  But over here nobody wants to talk, you know?  You can't even get anybody to say hi to you.
R:  Huh.  
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  You know, we're so used to being friendly around here, you know.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, if you're friendly over here people'll think you're probably some kinda weirdo or something, you know?
R:  Or that you're wanting something.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [several inaudible words] you know.  Like, oh, well.  Even the neighbors, they -- I mean, they'll tell you hi, but nobody really talks to each other over here so it's pretty quiet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everybody just stays to +themselves.  I guess it's a good thing though.  I don't know.
R:  It just depends on your situation I guess, you know?
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.
R:  Whether that's a good thing or not.
L:  No.
R:  'Cause if you need help [LAUGH] that's not a real good thing.
L:  Yeah, really. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Nobody's there when you need them.  Um ...
R:  Well, I've lived in different places, you know, even around here and the neighborhoods would be totally different.
L:  Oh, okay.  Huh.
R:  You know, 'cause the last neighborhood I lived in ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, just wonderful friends, you know?  Just everybody would, you know, meet outside and talk and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, let kids play and this, that and the other.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we moved out here.  I haven't had a single neighbor anywhere around come --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to the house or introduce themselves or anything.
L:  Yeah, huh.
R:  It's just totally black and white, you know?
L:  Yeah, definitely.  We're all different.  Huh.  I guess everywhere I've lived, like in the south, everybody was friendly, you know?  If you're a new neighbor and they'll go introduce themselves to you, you know, and everything.  They'll bring cookies or, you know, anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Help the kids play and everything, you know?
R:  Well, that's the way it was, you know, over there.  I mean, they didn't bring stuff, but they w- -- you know, all made a point to introduce themselves and get to know you a little bit, you know?
L:  Well, because that's the people you're living with.  You know, everybody should be friendly with each other, you know?  And help each other out if they need anything, you know?  L- just little things, you know?  I mean --
R:  Well, it made you more f- comfortable to let the kids run around and play --
L:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Because, I mean, if you don't know your neighbors then you're kinda like wary of where your children are going, you know?
R:  Right.
L: You don't know who they could be or what they're doing, you know?  So [inaudible] ... 
R:  But ...
L:  So, how many calls have you taken already for the surveys?
R:  This is my second.
L:  Oh, this is my third.  Huh.
R:  This is your third?
L:  Yeah, it still seems unreal to me that they will actually pay me to talk.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I was like, okay.  [LAUGH] If you wanna pay me a dollar a minute I'll go ahead and do it --
