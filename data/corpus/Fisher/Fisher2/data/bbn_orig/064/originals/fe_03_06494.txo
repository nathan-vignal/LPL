R:  Hi, my name's Terri.
L:  Hi, Terri, my name's Chris.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Um, so I guess we're talking about televised criminal trials?
L:  Yeah, kind of a strange topic I guess but what do you think?  Have you ever watched one?
R:  Um, I h- -- I, you know, I watched the O.J. trial.  Um, I think everybody did.  Um, but I don't know.  I try not to watch them.  I -- I -- feel like, um, [LIPSMACK] you know when you start putting people on stage like that it's just -- you know, pe- -- it's just so -- it seems so personal to be putting people like on TV like that, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  Yeah, I -- I watched a little bit of that O.J. trial too but normally I don't watch them cause I just don't think it's necessary.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- what's the point of it?
L:  Plus I think it affects the way people testify when they know they're on television.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know?
R:  And it becomes about ratings and, you know, what suit you're gonna wear and how the judge is gonna look and it just -- it's not -- it do- -- it becomes not about the trial, you know?
L:  R- right, yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Now, I don't know about you but I have several friends who are paralegals and they love it.  They say they get all kinds of great ideas from watching trials on television.
R:  Well, I guess they can get, um -- it's a good learning tool but for the rest of us, you know ... [LIPSMACK] I just remember that O.J. thing and, you know, a lot of the trials around that time were just so all consuming no one could do anything but just watch those, you know?
L:  Oh, I know.  
R:  It was like --
L:  I remember -- that was on TV all the time.
R:  Yeah.  Every minute --
L:  You know?
R:  -- was just another -- another, oh, this just in from the O.J. trial or --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- what -- what were those two boys who, um, [LIPSMACK] had murdered their --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- parents.  Remember they were on the --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- news all the time too.
L:  Yep.  And now, of course, it's Scott Peterson.
R:  Oh, is it?  I don't even see -- that's how out of touch I am.  I don't even [LAUGH] know who's on trial anymore, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like --
L:  Well, I don't think he's actually had a trial yet but that's all they're talking about on the news now.
R:  Yeah, it just seems like such a waste of time.  I mean, there's so many other important issues in the world and I just don't feel like we're paying attention to them, you know?  Um, we get so engrossed in these just -- the people have money and the big high profile cases.
L:  Yep.
R:  There's so many people who are being put in jail for things they didn't do or just things that are happening in the world that are just so unjust that it just seems to me it would be better if we spent our time [LAUGH] you know, reading or listening about them.
L:  Yeah, focusing on something else. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
L:  You have to wonder though.  I mean, there must be a lot of people watching this stuff or they wouldn't be putting it on because --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- you know, uh, there must be a lot of big advertising dollars to be had from doing that.
R:  Like Court TV and all that, yeah.  You -- that's the thing.  It becomes about making money instead of about trials.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know and --
L:  But boy, you know, they're -- it must be selling because otherwise you'd think it would have sorta gone by the wayside by now.
R:  Absolutely.  [LAUGH] I mean, it's gotta be making somebody money.
L:  I just can't believe it.  I mean, it's like ... who'd a thought we'd ever have a -- a whole television station called Court TV?
R:  I know.  It's r- -- it's unbelievable. 
L:  [MN]
R:  And it's running, like, what is it?  Almost twenty four hours a day, right?
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  See, we don't get it here in Florida.  
R:  Oh.
L:  At least not where I am.
R:  Are you in Florida?  I'm in New York city so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- all we see is trials on TV all the time.  You know, everything's, uh --
L:  You know, sometimes they play excerpts from it like on, um, MSNBC or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But we don't actually have Court TV on our cable system here so --
R:  Right.  Now, it's just too much.  I -- I originally thought the topic was about, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, death penalty cases or death -- but then when they res- restated the question I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had misunderstood it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, cause when they restated it, wasn't it something like have you ever watched one and ... I can't remember what the second part of it was but --
R:  Right, and I -- I don't know.  How -- how -- maybe how did we feel about it.
L:  Oh, yeah, and how do you feel about it, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's true.  Well, I don't ever intend to watch another one.
R:  No, me either. [LAUGH]
L:  And I think really, you know, if I think back to that time I think the only reason I ever watched any of that O.J. trial is because it was on every channel that you turned on.
R:  Absolutely.  You couldn't get away from it.  It was in every paper.  It was everywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that --
L:  I just --
R:  -- that trial is just so -- it just really affected the whole country.  It really divided the whole country in half.  You know?
L:  And I -- I always thought that was so stupid, you know.  I would go to work and people would be arguing about that trial.
R:  Absolutely.  I- it --
L:  And I mean ... [LAUGH] it was so crazy.  I mean --
R:  It look up so much of our time and -- and our space in our heads, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's how I feel.
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't think that's necessary.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At all and -- but I guess, a- as long as it keeps selling they're gonna keep doing it.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know?
R:  As long as there's money to be made people [LAUGH] are gonna keep putting it on TV.  Um --
L:  Yeah, I suppose pretty soon they'll be putting it on the networks, you know and --
R:  Right.  It's ama- -- it's amazing the con- -- which trials they choose to make a big deal out of.  Usually --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they're celebrities or -- or big murder cases, you know?  It's -- has -- you have to be pretty famous to get that kind of space that everybody's watching you, you know?
L:  Well, also it's gotta be something that's, like, so gruesome or so gripping that they think people won't be able to walk away from it.
R:  Right, like, those mothers who'd killed their children?
L:  Yes.  Yep, yeah.
R:  I think we're tot- -- we -- we can't believe that as a society that a mom would kill her kids so we just ... you know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] -- we get so engrossed in that too.
L:  Yeah, well, I think, like you said, there's plenty of other things that we could be -- do well to be engrossed in [LAUGH] besides these trials!
R:  I know.  There's so much else going on in the world.  I mean, really scary things happening in the world that ... you know, affect us -- affecting people in other countries every day and here and I just -- I wish we spent more of our time on that than on this other stuff, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, fortunately it has been a while since they really put one on nonstop. 
R:  Absolutely, yeah.
L:  But I think that's because there's so much other news happening.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's like, you know, the war in Iraq --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and all this stuff and I think if it hadn't been for that, maybe they would of dredged something up because --
R:  Right, they've gotta make news.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They gotta -- even if there isn't any, they've gotta make it so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] it's like -- so the war in Iraq has really kept us away -- I -- I mean, that has really kept us so interested in ... oh, it kept us away from everything else, hasn't it really?
L:  Yeah, pretty much.  Just like, um, the bombing of the World Trade Center did, you know?
R:  Yeah.  That was just -- they kept playing it over and over and I -- I mean, I'm -- I live in New York city so it was just -- it was so you couldn't get away from it.  It was like ... you know ... people we knew were there and it was ju- -- it was just all consuming, you know?
L:  Well, believe me, you couldn't get away from it down here either.
R:  I bet.
L:  It's just like any time there's a big news story, I don't care whether it's a trial or whatever --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they just keep running it over and over and over again.
R:  Just beat you over the head with it as if --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, you haven't already seen it on the other five channels.
L:  And it's like you know, I don't think I wanna see this any more. [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Really weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I do think people get saturated to the point of where they don't want to see any more.
R:  No, absolutely.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, there -- there came a time when there was all those trials and people were -- w- I can't watch this anymore.  It's ridiculous, you know?
L:  Mhm, yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I was just amazed though to listen at work to how many people were watching that stuff.  You know, and then they would -- they would argue and ... people would end up hitting their best friends over their opinions on these stupid trials. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know.  You -- you --
L:  And I'm like, you know, is this really important? [LAUGH]
R:  I -- and you know, I have to admit I got into fights over the O.J. case.  I certainly did.  I wish -- I mean, it was just hard.  Like, it just split so many people down the str- -- down the middle.  That case just -- I mean, it dealt with the race and just everything and fame and the way you could buy your, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- buy a good lawyer and get -- it was just so much was involved in that that even I -- [LAUGH] and I got into -- really sucked into it and got into arguments about it, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess -- and that's the perfect kinda case they're looking for too, I guess, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's gotta have a lot of issues and --
R:  Com- --
L:  -- it has the race card, even better. [LAUGH]
R:  And somebody that we've known for a long time and watched in the media in different ways for a long time.
L:  Yep.
R:  And then all of a sudden here they are in a different -- in a different capacity, you know?
L:  Yeah, I really thought that they were possibly gonna do this with that Robert Blake thing.
R:  Right, yes.
L:  Cause, you know, a celebrity.
R:  Yes.
L:  But I -- like I said, I think the war in Iraq and all that has kept that off television.
R:  Absolutely.  There's -- th- there actually seems to be more [LAUGH] pressing things --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, than, um, that these trials.
L:  Oh, like the economy, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I wish people would spend more time on that in general, you know, than just the war in Iraq or at least explore that war is affecting our economy, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  It's not affecting it in a good way I don't think.
L:  Well, apparently the only places the economy is really good is on Court TV. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] Where people are making a lot of money.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, to, uh ...
L:  That's kinda sad, isn't it?
R:  It is sad.
L:  It's a pretty sad commentary on our society. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it is and -- and about how much our society is built on selling things.  Sell, sell, sell and, you know, really those court cases are about marketing and ... you know --
L:  Yeah, and they shouldn't be.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  It shouldn't because people's lives are at stake, you know, and it -- it almost revictimizes the victims --
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  -- of these -- you know, you're being -- you're being shown throughout the whole, you know, world, the whole country in a certain way and ... you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I [LAUGH] -- I -- I struggle to find any positives.
R:  Right.
L:  To that televised trial thing.  Like I said, the only thing was like to have a couple of friends who keep telling me that it's just ... you know, it's just great.  They find out all these ... great things and I'm like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but that's their business, you know?
R:  Absolutely.  You know, I have a friend who watches Court TV all the time.  She watches it like soap operas, you know?  The way some people watch soap operas?  [MN] [LIPSMACK] Um, it's just like, oh, this is the new latest thing that happened on this case and I just can't be [LAUGH] bothered at all, you know?
