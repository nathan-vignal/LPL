R:  Hi, I'm Robyn.
L:  Hi, I'm Cathy.
R:  Hi, Cathy. [PAUSE]
L:  I don't think that they should be televised.  What do you think?
R:  I agree.  I -- I ... don't watch them and, you know, even though these people are public figures they still deserve privacy.
L:  Uh, absolutely.  Um ... and even the ones that are not public fi- figures, some, uh, people are put in a position ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that ... that is not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of their own accord, that I don't think ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they have any business ... uh, airing their, you know -- airing their laundry --
R:  Exactly. 
L:  -- their own personal lives ... to, you know -- to the public.
R:  Exactly.  You know, I -- people -- people's pr- lives are private and should remain that way.
L:  Absolutely.  And, uh, a -- a -- a huge issue that I have with it is, um ... who are the children that are watching this?
R:  Exactly.
L:  And what are they -- you know, and they're subjected to things that I don't think children should be subjected to.
R:  Yeah, and these things are on all day.  It's not like after ten o'clock at night.
L:  Exactly.  It is in the middle of the day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that -- you know, that really bothers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me and it's so hard these days with the ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, with the way everyone has to work and ... e- everyone's lives are so crazy, you cannot, uh, you know, you can't watch your children twenty four seven.
R:  Exactly.  You know, right now I've got my -- my kids and two of their friends here running around the house and ... if my son's upstairs watching something on TV I really wouldn't want him to be seeing a trial.
L:  Right, exactly.  Uh, I think a lot of things come up in a trial but, um ... they're just not good viewing for -- for a -- for a lot of [LAUGH] adults including myself much less children. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, and, uh ... you know, we have a case here that just came up recently in Texas and it was, you know, was something that -- that the wife did.  It was a horrible, horrible thing that happened and -- or the f- -- and it just happened a couple of weeks ago for the first couple of days it was all over ... you know, the -- I mean, they were already deciding the trial, the outcome, the whole nine yards.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, before, you know before they -- she was even been and signed a lawyer.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, uh ... the -- the poor husband, I mean, he had ... no idea what happened.  Well, now I'm wondering -- I mean, maybe it's completely hush hush, there has not been anything else ... said on the news about it.  Nothing.  So, I wonder what his -- what's going on with that.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, I -- I feel the whole, you know, besides the Court TV, I think the media just takes too much advantage and for victims and families of victims of crimes ... y- they -- they become, you know, hurtful.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Um, on this case that -- that just -- that just happened in the past coupla weeks, I don't know what -- if you know what I'm talking about but --
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  -- [inaudible] --
R:  I live in New York. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  The first day ... [LIPSMACK] um, the first day that th- -- that the incident happened ... um, you know, they already had -- they already had trial lawyers, you know, on some of the major networks and they were already, uh, you know, already asking, "Oh, do you think she'll get a fair trial?  Are they gonna have to move the trial?" [inaudible] the woman has not even ... you know, they were still [LAUGH] in the testing phases much less, you know, going to a trial.
R:  Wow.
L:  It -- totally amazing.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  But, uh ...  Yeah, I -- I -- I just think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and sometimes I wonder if actually some of these hi- high profile cases ... um ... don't ask for the attention.
R:  Yeah, but then they can't get, you know -- that -- that could disqualify a jury 'cause ... [LAUGH] what if the media af- -- you know, you have to not know everything about a case ... to be able to be on a jury and people know everything about all these high profile cases.
L:  Exactly.  I -- I don't understand how ... you know, with as much publicity as, you know, these high profile cases are getting, I do not understand how you could ever ... you know, uh, in good clear conscious say that no, you don't know anything about the case.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] I reckon that's pretty much impossible.  And it's not just one ... you know, it's just -- it's not just Court TV.  It's a lot of, you know, a lot of the mainstream ... um ... uh, stations.
R:  Oh, definitely.  You know --
L:  So, I -- uh, I don't know.  I ... and I just wonder how many other ... Americans feel the same way we do.
R:  Oh, I -- I think a lot.  Um ... [NOISE] even if w- you know ... shows where they'll have people, you know, airing their dirty laundry on the little, you know, judge shows [NOISE], you know, if -- I've flipped channels and ... you know, my kids get very disturbed by the things that are going on down there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know and it's ... you know, not to the extent of the Court TV or the, you know ... you know, those major networks that do shows [NOISE] but these are things that are on on a daily basis with people, you know, airing their dirty laundry and ... uh, you know, I find it horrible. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, it's, uh ... y- you just have to finally ... you know, you -- you have to learn to turn the TV off.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Period.  [NOISE] Um, you know, e- e- even you start flipping channels ... and, uh ... recently I just had to do that because I just got caught up, you know, in different things and I ... I finally this, "Th- this is just crazy.  It's just total craziness to sit and watch this stuff.  It's not productive at all".
R:  Yeah.  I mean, in my house I end up having CNN on.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, especially w- -- you know, when the children are round it's usually off.  Uh, they're off for a coupla days [LAUGH] for the holiday weekend, so, uh ... we have children's channels on most of the time now.
L:  Mhm.  What -- what ages are the children?
R:  Uh, my daughter's four and my son's ten.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] And the ten year old gets very upset about many things in the news but, you know ... certain things you have to see [NOISE] and, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I don't think it's a good thing to completely protect them and shelter them from everything, but there's -- there should definitely be a ... you know, a limit ... to what they see.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, wh- where we are he sees ... a lot, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  What -- what part of New York is it?
R:  Well, we're up by, uh, West Point.  We're about an hour outside the city but my husband's a city firefighter so ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, so he sees a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  I would guess so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah but we're down there a lot and ... yeah.  Thing- things, you know, if something is on about a fire or a firehouse or a firefighter on the news, it always stays on.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we're gonna -- there's a -- there's a new -- a new case that's really gonna be coming around out of California that is very high profile and, uh ... it's -- you know, that's gonna be amazing.  Uh, just about every night on some of the talk shows they have their attorneys on there and they're already talking about the case and what this is gonna mean, what that's gonna mean, the evidence that they don't or, uh, you know, that they don't have that they're speculating ... uh, you know that -- that the, um ... [LIPSMACK] prosecutor is trying to, um -- basically what they're saying is he's trying to, you know, to ... make us feel like they have more than they do have or they don't have more than they have.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  It's, uh ...
R:  Well, [inaudible] depends on how crafty your attorney is.  I mean, if you look at the Simpson case ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- I mean, all evidence from the prosecution side ... you know, looked one way, and then defense was able to make reasonable doubt.  But th- the -- the defense lawyers were very crafty.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I mean ... I don't know anybody personally who expected that outcome.  [NOISE] You know, uh --
L:  Uh, I don't either.  I'll -- I was totally ... shocked.
R:  [NOISE] And it became quite the media circus, you know.  It ruined the reputation of several, you know, attorneys.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it destroyed F. Lee Bailey's career.
L:  Hm.
R:  [NOISE] And, you know, I -- I think the --
