R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] I'm Sammy Smith. [NOISE] How you doing?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How are you?
R:  [NOISE] I'm okay.  I didn't even hear the [NOISE] topic.  Do you know what the topic was?
L:  Ah, yes.  It's to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- see if, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what we think of, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- criminals trials --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they should be televised.
R:  [NOISE] Hold on for one minute. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Yeah, I got children but th- -- they -- [PAUSE] no. [PAUSE] Uh-huh. [PAUSE] Okay.  So, I'll leave after the housing group.  Thank you.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yes.  Go ahead. [NOISE]
L:  Yes.  Where are you from?
R:  [NOISE] I'm from the Bronx, New York. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  [NOISE] Ah --
L:  I'm in South Central Illinois.
R:  [NOISE] Where? [NOISE]
L:  South Central Illinois.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  Just a little bitty r- rural town.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  H- -- what do you think of trials -- ah, criminal trials -- should they be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- televised or not?
R:  [NOISE] Um, depends on -- on what type of trial it is. [NOISE]
L:  Well, it would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- criminals trial of, ah, high crime --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and everything.
R:  Like on Supreme type of [NOISE] -- of -- on Supreme Court type of cases?
L:  [COUGH] That's kind of what I figured it was.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] Well, [NOISE] I'm not sure on by televising it [NOISE] would m- -- really make a -- any difference, [NOISE] you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, ah, unless the people would be able to, um, you know, actually c- call in and make votes or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, give their opinion also.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Then it would be helpful.
L:  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really a -- a -- really a bloody, gruesome trial, I don't think it oughta be on TV.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.
L:  [COUGH] I think that's where a lot of our crime comes from -- they watch too much TV.
R:  R- -- exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  And they get too many ideas --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- from the television, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And that's just what your drugs and everything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they get too much information on the air. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  I think so.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm just a -- just a peon here but that -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I kinda think that I could think of better things to put on the air than --
R:  Than, well, the criminal trials.  I --
L:  Yes, I think so.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Me too.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm --
R:  Especially -- s- --
L:  -- just not quite up on all of that.
R:  Uh-huh.  Especially New York City 'cause they'd be televised all day long. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, sure.  I mean, da- -- even in the r- -- small areas, you know --
R:  Believe it or not -- yeah, I know.  The same -- it's -- it's --
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Crime rate is high.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  And I just don't think that the individuals could even relax good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and tell the truth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they thought a TV camera was on them all the time.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  That's true. [NOISE] That's true.
L:  You know, I -- I -- that's too much -- I know I have been picked for jury duty before and I feel like I'm the criminal.
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  Time they get done questioning you, before the trial ever starts, you think you're the one that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- done something wrong.
R:  Exactly.  'Cause I've only -- did[?] on jury duty a --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- couple of times too and -- and just like, wow.  You know?
L:  I know my husband used to say, "If your name was drawn out for the lottery as many times it is for jury --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- duty, we'd be rich". [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But so far, ah, since he's been gone it -- well, yep -- it'll be three years this July he's been gone -- and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I haven't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had to go so far. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But no.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I just don't go with all of this on TV.  Some of it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just like they did with the O.J. Simpson and all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now, that was none[?] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be on TV.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] A- and that's -- you're dead right.
L:  Yeah.  You know.
R:  And they prolonged that.
L:  Oh, they sure did.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And just like this, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- woman they found her body --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yi- --
L:  -- parts -- part of her body worsted up.
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  Now, they're gonna want to put that on TV.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And I don't think that's doing justice to the victim or the victim's family.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true.
L:  Let 'em mourn and let --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them --
R:  [NOISE] Handle it they want to.
L:  That's right.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Not being --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on camera all the time, you know?
R:  Mhm.  M- -- publicizing it.
L:  I just don't believe -- I just don't believe in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting the camera in someone's face when they're trying to mourn and this madness.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just don't believe in that.
R:  [NOISE] That's right.  I n- no, me neither.
L:  Yeah.  I just don't, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I know if that was one of my family members --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I wouldn't wanna be seen on camera.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  That's true. [NOISE]
L:  And there's so much honoring this now that they think, "Well, there's the victim's family -- we'll +victimize them some more".
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  The buddies[?], ah -- [LAUGH] 
R:  You coming back? [NOISE]
L:  You know?
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  And, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but you'd -- really don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know what to -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  what to say for sure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, in some of it.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  That's true.
L:  Well, how's the weather in New York?
R:  [NOISE] Um, it's raining today.
L:  Is it?
R:  Well, it's not raining, it's just cloudy.  It was raining yesterday and the day before.  And it's supposed to rain --
L:  Well, we had a beautiful day --
R:  -- tomorrow.
L:  -- here yesterday.  It's been cooler but it was a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- beautiful day.  It's cloudy here today and they talk like we could get a shower now and then but just spot showers, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, ah, it's still supposed to be up in 'bout seventy today.
R:  Oh, that's good 'cause it's only on fifty eight here.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I know.  It's been cool here too.  Y- yesterday it was like the upper forties --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- in the morning --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and oh, you think, "Oh, gosh".  I had to kick the furnace on one time to get the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- chill out.
R:  [NOISE] Ah --
L:  But it's about sixty here now.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  You know?  And, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's cloudy but the sun has been out.  But it'll come back out, I hope.  I gotta mow grass. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  No.  It, ah ... [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No, they -- they -- I think they take TV just a little too far.
R:  Oh, yeah.  They definitely do.
L:  Ah, just on any crime scene, ah, they just televise too much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  I mean, ah, -- let's face it, if it was a -- your family member --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- murdered, would you want that camera showing their body --
R:  Oh, no. [NOISE]
L:  -- to the world?
R:  Mhm.  I wo- -- I wouldn't -- [NOISE] I'd want -- I would, um -- [NOISE] how'd you say? [NOISE]  Um, write a peti- [NOISE] -- a petition against that. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  I wouldn't -- I wouldn't want that publicized. [NOISE]
L:  No.  I wouldn't want it neither.
R:  Especially on TV.  Not even on radio.
L:  And -- and that's just like trials and everything on TV.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  They're gonna show these gruesome pictures.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And --
R:  Of bodies and stuff. [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  That's right.  I don't think it should be publicized.
R:  That's true.  That's true. [NOISE]
L:  I -- I just don't think they that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have any business doing that.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, tell whether they were guilty or something -- that's a little different.  But not showing the actual trial.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No.  I -- I think that they oughta be allowed to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mourn or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in private.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I wouldn't relax if I knew a TV camera was in the courtroom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To testify or anything.  You couldn't relax.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And how do they know they're telling the truth?
R:  [NOISE] That's right. [NOISE] That's the truth. [NOISE]
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And that's how some of them gets in there, ah, behind bars and they're not guilty.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And then we go with the governor we had in Illinois letting 'em --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all out after jurors --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- put 'em in there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then's when you got uproar again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I mean, I wouldn't want to -- I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't -- I just don't like it.
R:  [NOISE] That's true.
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I don't know about your situation or anything or where'd -- you know.  But I imagine it's fairly high crime there in the bigger cities than it is in the rural area.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, we're just in a little bitty town, you know?  Maybe two fifty population.
R:  Oh, wow -- that's small.
L:  And I mean, you can just sit out here on your front porch in the middle of the night if you want to.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  You know?  And, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know all your neighbors and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you visit back and forth across the yards and everything.  And it's just a small area.  I just don't think, you know -- I don't know how I would act in a big city, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Living there, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I know there's dozens and dozens and millions of people that does, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  Half the population is -- has been probably involved with the criminal system here.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  In one way or the other, you know?
L:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, misdemeanor charges.  But still, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  But your high crime and everything, I think that oughta be behind closed doors and if you want to sit in on that trial then I think that it should be that you could sit in on it.
R:  Mhm.  Right.  Right.  If you want to.
L:  But not -- yeah.  If you want to.  But I don't believe it oughta be on TV or the whole world could see it.  And take up all your others programs and all this.  I just -- I just don't go with it. [LAUGH] You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we have enough terrorism to worry about to start out with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then something like that -- I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't go with it, you know?
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  But I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, we gotta stay on here ten minutes anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It seems like it's longer t- today than -- than --
R:  Yeah, it -- yeah.  It d- -- do- -- yesterday was like that -- it seemed like it was about twenty minutes.
L:  Oh, it does?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Well, I'll be darned.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, ah --
R:  Okay.
L:  I think yesterday -- what was it?  Terrorism yesterday I think.
R:  Um, right.  Exactly.
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  And that was a pretty good topic.
L:  Oh, yes.  Like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, with this time and age, yes it is.  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you know, I -- I think that, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the lawyers and everything else -- I think they drag all this shit out.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  The -- the longer they can keep people in that courtroom --
R:  The more money they make.
L:  The more money they make.
R:  And that's exactly what it's about -- in all reality.
L:  And that's exactly what it is all about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It comes down to the almighty dollar.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
