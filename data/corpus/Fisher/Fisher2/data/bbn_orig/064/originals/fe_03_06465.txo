R:  Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  My name is Debbie.  How are you?
L:  Fine.  I'm Gretchen.  Um, so do you wanna start?  [LAUGH]  I sort of --
R:  Sure, um --
L:  -- don't know what I think about it.
R:  -- I -- I've never watched any criminal trials on TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm thinking -- and -- and personally I would ... think that they shouldn't be televised on TV.
L:  So, you didn't even watch like O.J. trial or --
R:  No --
L:  -- stuff like that?
R:  -- no.  I think it's ki- -- that it's really invasion of privacy on their part.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I think it's kind of like, you know, watching them execute somebody. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's kind of --
R:  I just -- I don't wanna see it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's enough ... things going on in the world.  I don't think that needs to be shoved in our face.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Someone's going through something that's horrific for one person or the other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm -- my personal opinion is let 'em have their day in court.  I wouldn't want it to be a ... if it was me in their place --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think I'd want it to be televised all over the world.
L:  Well, and especially the way they package it sometimes so that it's more about entertainment.
R:  Right.  I mean to me that --
L:  You know, it shouldn't be entertainment.
R:  Yeah!  It's totally not right. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  I -- I'm with you.  I agree with that.
R:  Because there's -- there's enough evil going on in the world ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, especially ... things going on now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we're so undelighted by the press and by ... what is being televised.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Why d- -- why do we wanna see things like that?
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] I -- I feel a little differently about just reporting on trials, you know, like --
R:  Now -- now that I think everyone --
L:  -- somehow if I were to read an account of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- some evidence that was brought up or ... you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I --
R:  Now, to me that -- that's different.
L:  Right.  And maybe it's a little less sensationalistic, you know?
R:  Right.  Um, I remember, uh ... god, it was years ago, they had a movie on ...
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it was like on a HBO or cable or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about how someone had committed this horrible crime.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they allowed the person -- the family of the person that they'd committed the crime against --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to chase them.
L:  Like a game?
R:  And -- 
L:  Like a game show?
R:  -- and enact retribution.
L:  Ugh!  Uh-huh.
R:  And to me it falls in that same category.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's like [LAUGH] wait a minute, you know?  Next thing you're gonna be having mobs chasing people through the street for crimes they may or may not have committed.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Uh, who are we to put ourselves to be judge and jury?
L:  Well, I think also like ... you know, like, the way a society treats crime --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or treats criminals ... has changed over time and --
R:  Oh yeah! [NOISE]
L:  -- I remember, um, I read a book by Michelle Suco[?] who writes about --  I mean, he writes about so many interesting things but one of his books had to do with crime and punishment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he was a philosopher.  [MN] And he wrote that ... you know, like, [SIGH] a thousand years ago or seven hundred years ago you would have very public executions, very public trials and ... it -- it's almost like it's served a different purpose in that era.  You know, like if someone were to be executed, their face would not be covered for example.
R:  Right.
L:  And then that progressed to, you know, they might still have public executions but the person being executed would wear a hood.
R:  Right.
L:  To the point now where the person being executed is not even ... seen, except by a select group of people who are there to be ... you know, like -- more like witnesses --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to the fact that this really did take place.  Um ... and I think his suggestion was that that's progress [LAUGH] you know, like we're a little bit less barbaric over time.
R:  I think we need to be really careful and society has stopped taking that care --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of how ... how we're perceived as a society.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that that has a lot to do with it when you're -- when you're ... since, as you said, sensationalizing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- an -- a crime, whether it's murder or thievery[?] or ... whatever the case may be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that it changes our perspective.  I, uh, have a friend who's a teacher and she says that nowadays children of all ages realize so -- have so much more information at their fingertips that we did when we were their age --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of the internet and television --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and newspapers.  And I think that's where we run into a problem is children are long- -- no longer terrified ... or shocked --
L:  Mhm, by things that happen?
R:  -- by anything that's going on in the world because they're so undulated with information.
L:  Mhm.  Well, and then so much of what has really happened in the world has turned into ... you know, over [LAUGH] forms of entertainment, like, you know --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- a movie of the week and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's just like I -- I don't think people need to be taught now to murder another person.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and I -- I think a lot of those movies are really about that, you know, are about --
R:  And I think that that's what -- when you televise crimes and -- and trials --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're educating people beyond the information they need to actually have access to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good point.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, you say, "Oh, well, watch how this person did it.  Oh, well --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- maybe the next person won't make this mistake".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, why do we wanna give them this much information?
L:  Yeah, I don't think it functions to help them not do [LAUGH] anything. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it, like, teaches them, like ...
R:  Why do we wanna educate it?
L:  -- this person got away with it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Why do we wanna give them a better education on how -- on how to pro- perform an atrocity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than they already have?
L:  Now ... I have also heard of ... [LIPSMACK] you know, in South Africa for example --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there was another African ... maybe it was Rwanda, you know, where ... maybe -- gosh, it may have been six or seven years ago --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- they were -- you know, the ... mass murders of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- particular ethnic groups of people?
R:  Right.
L:  And both th- -- in both of those countries there are public trials but they're geared not toward ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um ... like, it seems like the tone is a little different.  You know, like they -- they encourage a group of people to be at the trial to witness it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But in South Africa at least, it's more about, you know like, let's use these trials not to -- not even to necessarily punish people but to just ... be able to get the truth out there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of what happened because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, like, I think they were recognizing that sometimes the court system can ... [LIPSMACK] encourage ... people to not tell the truth.  You know what I mean?  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think they were saying, like, there's some value in like just stating publicly what actually happened --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and what your role in it was even as a perpetrator.  Even if you're not gonna be punished, you know, and sort of incenting people to speak the truth even if ... what they sacrifice is the ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- society's ability to punish them and I think that's a good thing for people to witness.
R:  I think --
L:  You know?
R:  -- but I think it should be limited to people actually having --
L:  Involved?
R:  -- to put themselves out to have to actually go to the place --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that the trial is taking place at.
L:  So, you're physically there?
R:  And view --
L:  Like you're -- you're not observing it by television or something?
R:  Right, where you have to -- if you're that -- that, um, interested in the outcome --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of -- of a trial or -- or a conviction --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that you should actually be there physically. 
L:  Mhm.  Well, and presumably those are people who have more of an interest in it, you know, like they --
R:  Right, rather than have it just be televised --
L:  -- might be family or -- mhm.
R:  -- or whoever wants to take a gander at it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or just a voyeuristic view of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, [LAUGH] there's so many other things.  My husband is completely addicted to all of the reality shows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's, like, no, that's sad because it's the same as ... as I said, you know, televising someone's execution.  Why do you want to watch what these people are going through to accomplish a feat?
L:  Now, is -- is that like Amazing Race and stuff like that that he likes?
R:  Yeah.  Well, look, Amazing Race I think is -- is entertaining in that you get to see how they function in another environment.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But to me it's like you're gonna watch Survivor and there's [LAUGH] sixteen people on an island --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how do they interact as a community and it's, no, that's --
L:  Survivor I don't really care for.
R:  They're not -- but they're not really reacting to ... like, you drop them out in the middle of a desert and say, "Who survived --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- the trek out of the desert?"  It's --
L:  Well, that show rewards it --
R:  -- so public ...
L:  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
R:  It's so publicly, um ... uh, i- i- it's very much public entertainment.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Amazing Race I think has its pros because it does show people overcurm- overcoming adversity in a situation that they're really not comfortable in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  R- [LAUGH] rather than ... "Hi!  Guess what?" you know, "Joey just ate a bug". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  [LAUGH] Or the -- the way that Survivor seems to me too is, like, they reward people for being nasty to one another.
R:  Right and in Ama- -- in --
L:  You know, [LAUGH] just like another piece of ... you know, that public trial stuff.
R:  Yeah.  But I just -- I do.  I think that public trials shouldn't be televised.  I think that if someone is unable to get to the trial and it affects them somehow, then it should be a closed ... link, maybe to someone who's homebound and they need to be a witness or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in a hospital.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Something like that.  That -- that would be --
L:  Or for their safety.
R:  -- the only place that would be acceptable.
L:  Yeah.
