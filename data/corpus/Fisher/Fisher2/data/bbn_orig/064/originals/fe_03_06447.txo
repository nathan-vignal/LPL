L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  M- --
R:  This is Shaun -- I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay.  This is Merle[?] and I'm from Canada.
R:  Oh.  Pl- --
L:  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
R:  Pleasure. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  How are you?
R:  Very good.  Um --
L:  Good.
R:  I totally missed what the topic was. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  I wasn't paying attention. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] Um, terrorism.  Terrorism -- and what did they say about terrorism?  How would we deal with terrorism?  Would we be in shock or would we panic?  Um, how would we deal with terrorism?  Um --
R:  Hm.
L:  I -- I guess America's -- is hit a lot more than Canada is.  Although, I -- I don't feel it's safe anywhere --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the world now.  I think it's spreading. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, I mean, it's worldwide.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Whatever.  So ...  Yeah.  So, um ...
R:  Huh.  Um, well, [COUGH] how would I react?  Well -- ah, that's kind of a silly question.  I -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know --
L:  I -- I -- I guess it would be natural that anyone would panic in the middle of a terrorist attack. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'd -- I -- I --
L:  Not too many could keep calm.  And I guess -- oh, the other question was; how would we, um, deal with it?
R:  How would I deal with it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, w- -- he- -- what am I going to do really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- like I said, like, I don't think anyone can get prepared for something like that and when it happens, I guess you would have to deal with it when it happens.  So, you know --
R:  I think if something really nutty happened, like, um -- ah -- you -- there's either -- there's s- -- only one or -- one or two possible terrorist scenarios.  One is either, um, you're -- it's -- it's you in a small area [PAUSE] or it's, um, -- it would be a -- a worldwide thing.  Or it'd be a, you know -- a -- a -- a global thing or a -- something of your country where you -- where the [PAUSE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, ah, I think if it was a scenario where, like, um, you know, it was war, [LIPSMACK] um, where the possibility of utter chaos ensuing -- I would just stay inside my house.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [LAUGH] ah, if it was a scenario of, like, me being on a plane that was hijacked, or something like that, ah, I really don't know what I'd do.  Um, ah, no one could really know what they'd do until they're put in that situation.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess it'd be pretty hard to prepare for that [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  I think i- if you -- if you know that you're gonna die, like the people that, ah, knew that, um, on nine eleven --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, then obviously then, you know, ah, I would -- I think I would do something about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but who knows? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, in other words, you've living day by day -- you're not worrying about if anything would happen in Los Angeles or ...?
R:  No.  No.  No.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, I guess you can't really live in a threat either.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fear and -- yeah.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we don't have those threats here in Canada yet.  We actually -- yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, our Prime Minister didn't even wanna join, um, President Bush when they went into Iraq there.  Right?  So --
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, although I -- I -- I actually supported, um, President Bush --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was quite ashamed that Canada never, um, wanted to volunteer to help because the United States would be right there for us when we needed help.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For, you know -- if we need help.  So, I -- I felt that was quite a slap in the face.  So --
R:  I think it's r- -- ah, it's retarded that we would ask in the -- for help in the first place since we knew that we were gonna win regard- -- ah, it was like, ah, David versus Goliath, you know?  And that [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  Right. Yeah.
R:  Um, I think it was just, like, Bush throwing his weight around, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, trying to get -- trying to get everyone together and if they're not together then he w- -- he -- he longs to make a big stink about it.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, just like he did with France.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know?  It [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  H- h- he's gotta make himself look important.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  All presidents have to do that.
L:  Sure. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think he's probably just making up for his, ah, father's mistakes when --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- they went in and -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- kinda, left behind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.  What part of Canada are you in?
L:  Um, ah, k- -- Edmonton.  Edmonton, Alberta.
R:  Edmonton, Alberta?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where's that at?
L:  Ah, next to BC.
R:  BC?
L:  British Columbia, Vancouver area.  Next to the coast.  No?
R:  [LAUGH] I've been into Canada and for the life of me -- I've been there twice and I don't know where the heck I was.
L:  You don't know which province you were in?  No? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I came in through --
L:  Yeah.  Not too many people --
R:  -- Detroit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, ah, I don't know where that would be -- where it would end up.  Like, you -- there's, ah -- like, I think it's called the Lincoln Tunnel?  It takes you under the -- one of the Great Lakes and into Canada.  Ah --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I -- but I don't know what major city that is.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, probably Toronto.
R:  Toronto?
L:  Toronto.  Yeah.
R:  Could be.  Could be.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I -- I r- --
L:  What I -- I -- sorry?
R:  I really enjoyed it though while I was there.
L:  Yeah.  So, you came summer time or you came in one of our lovely winter seasons?
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I think it was in the winter time -- it's been a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was probably thirteen or fourteen years old when, um -- last time I was there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm twenty eight now.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, good.
R:  But -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, I really -- I really did like it.  It's, ah, um -- it's like a mixture of, like, America meets Europe.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, di- -- you've -- if those two had a baby it'd be Canada. [LAUGH]
L: Oh, right. [LAUGH] In the middle. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  The different money weirds me out but [LAUGH] other than that I think I would definitely live in Canada.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- well, I like winter.  I, um, you know --
R:  Yeah -- me too.
L:  I guess I'm used to the colder what have you so, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Actually, I think there -- there might be a few of us going down to Vegas coming up here in --
R:  Oh, you're gonna hate it. [LAUGH]
L:  -- June.  So ...  Well, it -- yeah.  I think it's gonna be a little hot at that time. [LAUGH] Sure.
R:  Oh, more than a lot.
L:  But --
R:  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, yesterday here in Los Angeles, it was a hundred and ten degrees.
L:  Is -- yeah.  See -- yeah.
R:  And this like ah, um, ah -- a cooler compared to Los Vegas.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Los Vegas is always just --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- crappy hot.
L:  Wasn't that supposed to be like one of the top terrorist, um, m- m- -- areas anyway?  Like, they were looking at aiming at Los Vegas, I believe?
R:  Oh, were they?  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I could see that though.
L:  I -- I think that was their first attempt before they even, ah, wanted to attack in the New York towers there.  So --
R:  Wow.
L:  [inaudible] is that.  Something went wrong there.  I -- I don't know the full scenario but I guess that would be one of their major attractions, right?
R:  Huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could be.
L:  I guess the best is just to avoid where traffic will be, where crowds will be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if a person wanted to avoid terrorism.  Um -- [LAUGH]
R:  I know they tried h- here at L.A.X. -- the airport --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, here in Los Angeles and failed.  Um, but, ah, that's about as closest it's ever come to, ah, in -- ah, for me. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  For terrorist stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, you know, 'cause New York is on the other side of the country.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Um, and all that.  But, I was there, um --
L:  Have -- well, I was just gonna ask, ah -- you have been to New York?
R:  Yeah.  I was -- I was there about a month and a half before it happened.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  In fact, I was right at --
L:  Like, were you right there?  Yeah.  At the --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I actually, um, went down to the, ah -- they call it the [PAUSE], um -- where the -- where the Twin Towers are and for the life of me I -- my friend who I was staying actually told me to go and see that build- -- [PAUSE] right past it and I didn't -- didn't even c- care, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Didn't even affect me at all.  I just, ah, didn't even think of it.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  Oh.
R:  It just looked like every other building out there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a lot different -- where -- you know, if you don't know what you're looking for, i- it just looks like any other building so I didn't really care. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well.  Yeah.
R:  But I could --
L:  I'd like -- I'd like to go.  I'd like to at least see where it was in New York there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I can -- I can actually say that I was there before it -- it was gone.  So, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it would be interesting to see what it's like now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ... [LAUGH] True.
R:  Is -- is this, ah, the first one of these you've done?
L:  This is actually my third -- my third.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  This is my second.
L:  Oh, is it?  Oh, okay.
R:  And they told me that, um, we could only do three.
L:  Right.  Before the first check comes out or what have you.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- but -- I mean, once you do three you'll be doing more won't you?
R:  Um, well, I -- I don't know.  They said that that was -- I got the impression that's all I could do.
L:  Ah, I think it's three per month from what I understand.
R:  Ah.  Oh, that's good.  That's good to know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's --
R:  That's easy money. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Assuming that we actually get our checks.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, okay.
R:  We'll see. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Where did you hear about this at ...?
L:  Um, actually I -- I do some mystery shopping on the side --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, it was on one of the Delphi[?] forms.
R:  Oh.
L:  One of the other mystery shoppers had announced it and -- yeah.  Yeah.  So, how about you?
R:  I think I found it online.  There's a thing called craigslist -- a website.
L:  Craigslist?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I think they actually have ones in Canada.  It's like, um -- like a -- just a classifieds thing for your -- for your community.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- and I think that's where I found this.  It's like the best website in the world.  Um, in fact, I'm almost positive they have at least one or two in Canada.  Um, you should look for that -- it's a great site.
L:  What -- under Craig?
R:  Ah, yes.  C.R.A.I.G.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Cr- Craig --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, come in.  Sorry -- someone's knocking at my door.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Huh?  Oh, she's calling your phone? [LAUGH] Sorry -- just a second.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Hello?  Hey, let me give you a call right back okay?  J- -- ah, just give me about two minutes okay? [PAUSE] Okay.  I'll give you a call back.  I promise. [PAUSE] Yes. [LAUGH] I'll call you right back.  All right.  Bye sweetie. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, sorry. [LAUGH]
L:  So, what time is it in --
