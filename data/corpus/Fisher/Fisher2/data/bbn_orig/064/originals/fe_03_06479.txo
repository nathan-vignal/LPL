L:  Hi.  Sharon from Maryland.
R:  Hi, I'm Omar.
L:  Omar, where are you from?
R:  Um, actually Maryland but I'm down in North Carolina right now.
L:  Oh, okay.  Very good.
R:  Wh- what part of Maryland?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] we're in Serona[?] Park --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- outside of Baltimore.
R:  Okay.  I used to live in Montgomery County.
L:  Oh, very g- -- yeah, I lived in Montgomery County actually, all my life. [LAUGH] 
R:  Is that right?  What part?
L:  Ah, Rockville.
R:  Oh, I was in Germantown.
L:  There you go.  Well, everybody I knew lived in Germantown.
R:  [LAUGH] Is that right?
L:  So, what do you think about this? [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] First thing that comes to mind is O.J.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you think it should have been all televised?  Do you think the public deserve to watch all that?
R:  No.  I mean, 'cause the only reason that it was publicized --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, because bear -- they're people who murder people every day.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  Excuse me.  Upstairs.  I don't want to hear another word from anybody.  I'm sorry, I got two young 'un's upstairs.
R:  That's all right.
L:  [inaudible] they don't understand not to tattle.  Um, exactly.  It -- it's -- it's kind of a personal, private matter to a certain degree, you know?
R:  Yes.  
L:  And aren't you innocent 'til proven guilty and --
R:  Mm.  That's what they supposedly --
L:  +Supposedly, yeah.  Well, I -- yes, I'm a little jaded too.  My husband is a police officer.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, you know, it's just -- you just wonder, you know, does anybody really -- is anyone really innocent until proven guilty?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and especially any more in our society.
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, look at who, ah, Scott Petersen.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, the poor -- he -- he'd really -- I mean, h- -- whether I think he did it or not is kinda irrelevant but, um, you know, we don't necessarily have all the facts and -- and the media can play up or down, whatever [NOISE] --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- they choose to.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Um, you know, in this age of editing and [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things.  Um, [LIPSMACK] but, it is -- it is kinda sad because, you know, that is -- oh, so much of your private life has to come to o- -- you know.  O.J. to a certain degree was a public figure --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, unlike the Scott Petersen case who, you know, was a regular gentleman.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, like I said, p- -- millions of people are killed every single day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What makes one case more high profile than another?
R:  Mm, exactly.
L:  Um ... I dunno.
R:  I mean, it's more or less, they do it for ratings.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know, and because they happen to be high profile people, and even when they're not high profile people, it's just like people wanna see drama.
L:  Right.
R:  And it sells.  And that's why the media plays it up.  Now, like, for instance, with the O.J. thing, once it got to a certain point, I was tired of hearing about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was tired of seeing it.
L:  Yeah.  I only saw p- -- bits and parts of it.  I actually, I think I was working full time anyway at the -- at the time.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I'm a stay home mom now, but, um, you know, it just gets ridiculous.  It gets -- a lot of it is just, you know, like you said, drama for the sake of -- I mean, they televise it, like, on almost every single channel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  All day long.
L:  And that's why I didn't have cable.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Which was, like, horrendous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, that's all you're getting, pretty much.  And, um, you know, wh- why -- that, I always wonder about that too, you know, the President's going to speak --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- okay, let's televise it on thirty channels.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, okay --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well, that's -- it is important that the President speaks but --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- why is the need to have it on every single channel?  I mean, the exact thing -- I guess Tom Brokaw need the job and --
R:  That's right.
L:  Well, [LAUGH] they -- they're people, they're together too soon for what they're in or whatever.
R:  Well, I mean, it's -- it's all about ratings and it was down to them --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- making money.  Because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what happens is when they -- when they publicized those high profile trials --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they charge more money for the commercial time.
L:  Right, yeah, that's true.
R:  'Cause the more -- the bigger the audience you have, the more they can charge.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when it's something that, you know, that they glamorize for the public, and they get people's interest into it, people tune in.  And they wanna see it.  So, the people who advertise things, they get a chance to actually, you know, get a large audience to try to sell their products or their services.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they use the -- they use the accused as a scapegoat in order to do that.
L:  That's very, very true.  What do you do now, may I ask?
R:  Ah, networking.
L:  Yeah, okay.  Um, you sound like a lawyer [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, you know, just speak -- you're -- you're making very, very good sense and, unfortunately, yes, it is money that makes the world go round.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whether or not you're, you know, Joe Schmo or, like you said, I guess because, you know, she was pregnant and, you know, O.J. was a public figure and he killed a white woman --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that might have been a little more, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A good looking, you know, woman and [LIPSMACK] um, you know, whatever the media decides, okay, this is -- we're going to pick and choose who we want to sensationalize.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, like you said, so it's about the almighty dollar.
R:  I mean, this [inaudible] is the Jon Benet Ramsay the situation.
L:  Yeah.  A- --
R:  After -- well, after a certain point in time, I got tired of hearing that.
L:  Yeah.  It's sad.  It's a child but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, there's so many children, unfortunately too, that get killed every day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or abducted every day and, um, I guess they were lucky with that Elizabeth Smart case.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  You know, that -- I'm wondering, are they going to televise that, you know? 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Personally, y- -- I guess he's not that good looking, even to look at.
R:  Okay.
L:  Is that what it comes down to, too?  Scott Petersen's a better looking man?
R:  Mm.
L:  And, um, you know, okay, all the -- all the women wanna f- -- I don't think so [LAUGH]. 
R:  Well, I guess the more sensational the crime, the more likely they are to try to air it --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- to the whole world.
L:  Um, but unfortunately, I am kinda addicted to some of these reality shows, to a certain degree, but it's real reality, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, you're -- well, I dunno, my husband debates about The Survivor, if that's real reality or not.
R:  Yeah, h- -- I watch shows like that.
L:  The, um, -- but, I guess, it -- it's people, everyday people are, like you said, the celebrities, everybody's geared to these, you know, want to -- one -- what these celebrities are all up to and --
R:  Well, I mean, like, for instance, as you say that I'm also thinking, the Wino- Winona Ryder case.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, she got caught stealing a couple of things out of the -- what was it?  A Norstroms --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or Saks, Fifth Avenue or something like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one of those places.  People shop lift every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But because [NOISE] Winona Ryder shop lifted --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- okay, now all of a sudden, the whole world needs to know about it.
L:  Right.  I just thought that was -- that was wrong.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, that is -- when does it become invasion of privacy?
R:  [NOISE] Hm, exactly.  Well, see what goes on is, the way they get around it, see -- in a -- in a courtroom --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when they have cases it's open to the public.  
L:  Right.
R:  You can go down to the courthouse all you want and watch the different cases, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know that they are -- that they try.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, what the media's stance is, is actually, since it's a public place --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a public forum, they're actually allowed to come in there with the cameras and tape the stuff.
L:  [MN] Mm.
R:  So, in -- in terms of that, no, that -- you don't really have -- once they have you in the system, you have very little rights.
L:  Right.  Well, then -- then sometimes you see, like in the newspapers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this honest[?] rendering of, you know, the -- the defendant, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When, I guess, do you have to try to plead that I want my case closed or ...?
R:  [NOISE] It all -- it all -- it all boils down to the judge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I can't -- wh- what was the name of the -- the judge for the +O.J. -- ah, O.J. case?
L:  Oh --
R:  +Ito or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Argh.  I --
L:  Something like that.
R:  -- I forget his name.  He was an Asian guy.
L:  I can picture him quite vividly, unfortunately.
R:  Yeah.  Asian guy with a black beard.
L:  There you go.
R:  It -- it was really his choice as to whether he wanted to allow the media into the courtroom or not.
L:  Right.
R:  But, because of all the public --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, how can I say, mm, fascination with it and public interest --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's being leaned[?] -- I mean, when you have case of that magnitude and it's that well publicized, there are other people involved that are actually influencing him.
L:  Well, do you think it's helping to further his career, to a certain degree, too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because he wants to be, you know, ah, Supreme Court judge some day.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, what's the next stepping stone for, you know --
R:  Mhm.  [inaudible] 
L:  And if I do a good job on this case, ev- everybody's going to see and then I can get more money, of course, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, my two cents and, I mean, look at, ah, Marsha Clark --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she sold her book and, ah --
R:  Johnny Cochrane, now he has a commercial that comes on TV. [NOISE] 
L:  Yes, I know.  I had a frie- -- actually, I have a friend in North Carolina who was -- h- her husband's in the navy and they recently moved back to North Carolina.  They lived -- they were my neighbors for a little while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're in the military.  And, um, [SIGH] she was quite fascinated with the Johnny Cochrane, ah, [LAUGH] persona and, um, all that.  And I -- when I told her, "Yeah, he's got a TV ad now.  He's opened a, um, you know, place in Washington" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  She goes, "Oh, my goodness". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Because before O.J., you didn't know who Johnny Cochrane was.
L:  No.
R:  None of 'em.  Robert Shapiro, none of those guys.
L:  Right.
R:  See, now they're high profile -- I mean, they were -- they might have been high profile lawyers with their state, for their local area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but now they're national high profile lawyers.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now Johnny Cochrane can put a, you know, a -- an ad on television, and people who, you know, who do need legal counsel, "Oh, I can get Johnny Cochrane".
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause now he's open to everybody.
L:  Right.
R:  Him --
L:  He's world famous, now.
R:  Mm, of course.
L:  He's a man of the people.
R:  All of -- all of them became famous off of it.  Ah, Christopher --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Darden[?], Marsha Clark, Shapiro, all of 'em.
L:  So, everybody has, except the defendant, really, who has a good stake, "Oh, I do want this televised".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, unfortunately, that's your lawyer who are com- campaigning for you.  I guess unless, you know, you really kinda said, "Look, I'm -- I'm going to fire you unless you, [LAUGH] you know, get this --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  I dunno.  But, um --
R:  But didn't O.J. put out a tape too?
L:  Yeah, after -- after the fact.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, last I heard, he was still looking to hunting down the killer too, wasn't he?
R:  Mm, sup- --
