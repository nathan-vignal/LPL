R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] This is Sue.
L:  Hello?
R:  How you doing?
L:  Sue?
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm Danielle.
R:  Danielle?
L:  Oh, no, we have an echo on the line.  This is gonna be very annoying.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH] Are you on a cellphone?
R:  No.  [MN]
L:  Oh, okay, I am.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, okay so, criminal -- televised criminal trials?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [COUGH] Have you done this before?
R:  The phone call thing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Okay, I haven't so --
R:  Okay, well, you just talk a little bit, then I'll talk a little bit and -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Well, I've never actually watched one, um, because I don't have a TV and I haven't had one since I was twelve.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but I guess, um, high profile people like O.J. Simpson and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, who else?  I mean ...?
R:  Oh, well, that's the one that --
L:  Rodney King?
R:  Yeah.  That's the ones that really come to mind.  Um, I'm sure there's been other ones on there.  Maybe if you get different channels you'd get different ones I guess but as far as j- --
L:  Yeah, I guess there's like Court TV --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but those aren't really ho- high profile.
R:  Yeah.  Um ... I don't know if the ... what was the actress that got caught stealing stuff?
L:  Oh, Winona Ryder?
R:  Yeah, I don't know if her stuff was but it sounded like they were going to but ... [LAUGH] you know, after -- after watching all that O.J. stuff over and over every day, of course, I didn't sit there and watch it but, you know, every time you turned the TV on to find something to look at --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was always on there.  I ... I wouldn't --
L:  How many days did that go on?
R:  I don't know.  It went on for months.  Uh --
L:  Months?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought it was just like weeks but no? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it seemed like [LAUGH] months! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Remember they were making a call for, like, unbiased jurors?  And I was thinking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well, I haven't seen --
R:  That would take forever.
L:  -- anything about it so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you would of been a good one for that.  I mean --
L:  I would have been a perfect candidate but I still in -- uh, like, I was just out of col- high school so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- really busy.  [LAUGH] But --
R:  Well, you would have, uh, sat there in the courtroom, uh, in -- and got --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I think seven dollars a day. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, Jeez! [LAUGH]
R:  So, but you'd a been on TV --
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  -- maybe.
L:  Yeah, great. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I dunno.  I don't, uh -- you know, I think if somebody's really interested in the case they can find enough on the internet or in the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- newspapers, you know, but to just dominate, you know, the networks for something like that I -- I just don't think so.  I don't ...
L:  So, why do you think that they would put 'em on there?  I mean, is it just public interest or --
R:  Well, they're -- yeah, there's enough -- there are I'm sure enough people that are interested that would watch it and, of course, I'm sure --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a- anytime they went to a commercial break the pro- advertising was probably about, like, uh, the Superbowl [LAUGH] they would be real [inaudible].
L:  You know, I guess that's kinda the original reality TV.
R:  Yeah, I bet it would be.
L:  You know, like the court cases and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I --
L:  And the cop shows.
R:  -- I don't spend a lot of time in front of television --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I -- I do ... uh, every now and then in between cooking supper and waiting for somebody to come in or something like that, sit down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and watch, you know, a little bit of that court stuff where --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, it's, you know, a neighbor's dog went over and killed their cat or ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, this person borrowed their car and wrecked it and who's responsible for it.  You know, that's kind of a little interesting 'cause that's more down to my level about what's going on, you know?
L:  Exactly  But when you're talking about, like, um, with the O.J. Simpson for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- example.  He just, you know, like, when he was on trial for killing his wife --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, that was kind of a -- something I don't think many people could relate to. [LAUGH]
R:  No, but I tell --
L:  I hope. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you what, I'll tell you one that I believe probably will be, that's the Lacy Peterson ...
L:  Who's that?
R:  Uh, Lacy Peterson, the girl in Cal- -- woman in California that was eight months pregnant went missing Christmas Eve and they --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and they found her body and the ... baby evidently -- her body gave birth to the baby after she died.
L:  Oh!  That's --
R:  They found her -- y- you hadn't heard about any of that stuff?
L:  No, I had- -- uh, like, I said, I don't have a TV.
R:  You don't read the newspapers?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  Oh, my goodness. [LAUGH]
L:  I've been si- -- I've been -- I just got a new contract so I've been working like crazy.
R:  Yeah.  Well, this has been going on really since like November.
L:  Oh, Jeez and this is --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry, December.
L:  Where is this?
R:  California.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  This was about the time all those little girls went missing but, you know, different area.
L:  Oh, right.  I was --
R:  That -- that definitely --
L:  -- up in Seattle.
R:  Oh.  That definitely will probably be something the media will pick up on I'm sure because ... you know, everybody's interested in it now and everybody's already got their own opinions about, you know, what happened and there's been a lot of coverage on it already and everybody was --
L:  Did they find the person who did it?
R:  I think it's her husband.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  He went out -- he went out in the boat.  See, this is all, you know, media stuff too.  He went out in the boat the day she was missing and then come to find out this girl came forward and said, "He- he's been my boyfriend for two months but he didn't tell me he was married" and all this kinda stuff.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  So, uh ... y- I'm sure that'll be -- that'll be wide -- widespread coverage when that goes to trial.
L:  God, that's awful.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's an awful story.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  There's, um ... there's --
L:  But that's --
R:  -- been a few things where they've had a little bit on television, like, um ... [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] the Van Dam -- little girl Van Dam that was, uh --
L:  Yeah, Danielle Van Dam.
R:  -- kidnapped by her -- yeah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Van Dam.  Uh, was kidnapped and murdered and ... all the stuff that they had b- bu- --
L:  But did they show the trial of that guy?
R:  Um --
L:  I don't think they showed his trial, did they?
R:  -- I think they showed segments of it but it wasn't where you sat there and watched the hor- whole courtroom scene like they did on --
L:  I think there are --
R:  -- on the OJ.
L:  -- laws, um, about a lot of courtroom stuff, that's why they have those courtroom illustrators and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I wonder what, um, you know, if these celebrity trials on the TV are -- are somehow different.  I mean, I think the Winona Ryder trial wasn't on TV except for in little clips.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, probably cause of legal reasons.
R:  Yeah, well, I think some of the things that involve children it's because of their age.  You know, they're minors and trying to keep your identity secret and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- keep it on multi camera and that sort of thing.
L:  [COUGH] Right.  Well, and victims of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of crimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know are always are ... it's a touchy subject.
R:  Yeah, but I suppose if they -- if they ... if they didn't have 'em on regular TV stations, if there was that many people interested they'd probably put it on some cable station or satellite or something like that where somebody, you know, that had the interest would be willing to pay to watch it or something, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Like a sports [LAUGH] channel or something.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- wouldn't be one, uh -- you know, like I said, if it's something I'm interested in I don't have time to sit there all day and watch it but it's something I could pick up off the, uh ... internet or what -- news- -- I don't really read much newspapers, uh, get those off the internet also.
L:  So, do you think it's, um ... do you think it's -- it's mainly like interest in news stuff that -- that, uh, makes people watch --
R:  No.
L:  -- this stuff?  Or is it --
R:  No.  It's either the celebrity thing or, uh, you know, how people just have to gawk and stare at a wreck, you know, to see what's happened and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who's gonna say what or -- I think it's that.  I don't think it's, uh, that they're interested in the legal process. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  I think it's --
L:  -- I mean, uh, you know, it could be a- any number of stuff like the news part of it or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that -- huh, that's interesting.  Right -- I got -- I got that that would be a great channel, you know, a very successful channel.
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't -- they wouldn't get any money from [LAUGH] me.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Unfortunately, but, uh ... uh, if it had anything to do with science or biology or agriculture I'd probably would.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  Well, the, um -- it's interesting 'cause I -- I was a media studies student in -- in, uh -- at -- in college just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before, just a couple a -- uh, like, a year ago, and, uh ... and these type of things are really interesting for people who wanna feel better about themselves actually.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  For r- reality shows like the Jerry Springer Show and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, it's, um, it's a way for people to kinda feel better about the situation that their own lives are in and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, like, you know, you look at all those things and you're like, Jeez, I'm glad that's not me!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think I could ever get into a relationship that bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, with a male transvestite hooker, you know?
R:  Oh, well, it's just a bunch of [LAUGH] garbage. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] In fact, you know ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so ...
R:  Um, we don't --
L:  W- --
R:  -- have a lot of, uh, media cases, you know, I'm from North Carolina, around here that really ... would set anything off as far as having to be on TV.  I mean, no big ... you know, big items that would be here.  I -- I think most of the ones have come like maybe from Florida or ... you know, California.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  Is that where you're from?  North Carolina?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm, I live in [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, uh, yeah, I can't think of any real big issues that -- that we've had that would ... that the [LAUGH] media would wanna pick up and use for court documentary or anything like that so --
L:  Well, then with the celebrities I think it's a totally -- I mean [COUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- most of the -- I mean, the -- the celebrities do weird crimes that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that are interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  And you know what?  O- other than the O.J. thing, I think a lot of it is pub- publicity stunt stuff too.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, you know, their -- their career is kinda on the downslide.  They haven't had anything for a while so they ... do something wild and crazy and ... you know, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get their name back in the press.  Get their name back in the headlines.
L:  I guess the thing is, like, the people who -- whose trial I would watch if, you know, if I were gonna watch a celebrity trial would --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- be people like Axle Rose or ...
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, somebody who would be really ridiculous in court, you know?  Somebody who would just like --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- throw stuff.
R:  -- you know ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they had, uh, this court thing about Michael Jackson and, um, and they used to have clips of it and a lot of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was on the internet, well, some of it was on TV also --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about where he had cancelled some shows ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- and his producer was suing him and about how he got in there and made these funny faces and was pretending like he was the devil and sticking little horns up and I -- you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, and then -- and then the whole deal was, uh, all the press got into is he really nuts or you know, what's his problem?
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Well, [SIGH] I thought --
