R:  You're in where?
L:  In Canada.
R:  Canada?
L:  Near Victoria BC.
R:  Oh, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada?
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in, uh, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I know where you are. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, y- --
L:  So, do you watch television trials?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [SIGH] I did a few of 'em.  I guess most of 'em I don't though.  Do you watch, uh, trials on television?
L:  No, not at all.
R:  None?  Never?
L:  [COUGH] No.  I don't -- I don't think I need the aggravation myself.
R:  Oh.
L:  Did you watch, uh, O.J.?
R:  Uh, yeah, but not the whole thing.  I -- I never watched the whole thing, e- even O.J. and even Robert Blake but I -- catch some of it.
L:  Oh, was Robert Blake's on TV too?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] I don't think his was televised though.
L:  No, eh?
R:  No.  No.  Um, [SIGH] can you hold on just one second, please?
L:  Of course, yeah.
R:  Okay.  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  [MN] [PAUSE] [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, hi.  Oh, [several inaudible words] --
L:  You came back. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I came back, yeah.
L:  Did you change phones?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I had to change phones, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  You know --
L:  So, we're not doing so good on the topic.
R:  No.  No, this one's a hard topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it is, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Maybe we should just talk about something else.
R:  Yes.  Uh, well, yeah, I'd like to do that but, uh, I think their rules are we're supposed to talk about this --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- or at least try to talk about this.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I guess.
L:  We'll try and talk about it.  So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I'll go.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Uh, let's see --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- um, [NOISE] was there a watching trials on TV or was -- was it?
R:  Uh ... well, I think part of it I did watch cause I found out that, uh, Marcia Clark was the chief District Attorney of Los Angeles county and I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- found out that, uh, Judge, uh, [inaudible] was the, uh, Superior Court Judge and I think I might have learned a few, uh, legal terms and a few, uh, laws, uh, so, uh, it was kind of informative and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- educational in a way, you know?
L:  So, which trial was that?
R:  That was, uh, the O.J. --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- Simpson trial, but I did not watch that much of it.  Maybe just one or two days or something like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I -- I -- I never watched too much of it though so I never actually knew, uh, everything or near everything.
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember before the trial, um, was, um, seeing that Blazer go down the road on TV.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  And that was like way before the rest that they had live --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- coverage of it so I just don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know how you can --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- how you can have, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a fair trial --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or anything like that with -- with television's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- influence --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- while it's happening and then also --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- during the time that the, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have the trial on television.  That's bound to influence them.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it is cause, uh, you know, if, uh, you're shown in your, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- vehicle in your Bronco --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the freeway and there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at least five squad cars chasing you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- up and down the freeway and there's a helicopter chasing you and they got the roads blocked off it looks like you're in the wrong.  It looks like you're guilty.
L:  It does, doesn't it?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it does.
L:  It does.
R:  Sure it does.  Whether or not you're guilty it looks that way; it seems that way.  There's something definitely wrong [LAUGH] there.
L:  And the v- -- and -- and evidently it was going, like, really slow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, [LAUGH] the -- the --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the Bronco and everything.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That's just so strange.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, I guess, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so there really was -- did that happen actually in your area then?  [NOISE] The actual --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- crime must have happened in your area.
R:  Uh, well, it was not my area.  It was, uh, like about, um, I guess twenty miles away or maybe not, uh, quite that much but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was not in my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- area though.
L:  No?
R:  No, no.  I think about eighteen miles away from where I live.
L:  Oh, okay.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it just happened to be your local -- your s- local government that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that g- -- that got the courts.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That got, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- must of been pretty busy around there for a while.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I think that trial ran on for over --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- over -- well, was it over a year or not that long?
R:  Uh, I think it went on over a year.  I do -- I think so, I really do, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I thought so too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What about the Robert Blake one?
R:  Yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't --
L:  How do you keep track of that?
R:  I think they just told about certain things about his trial on the television but they never actually --
L:  [NOISE] Oh!
R:  -- televised his trial.
L:  Yeah, well that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, so, O.J. really is the only one I can think of but I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe, wait a minute, there was Clinton.  Wasn't -- wasn't that on television?
R:  Uh, he -- was he on trial?  Did he have his trial on -- televised?
L:  Yeah!  Remember that whole Monica Lewinsky thing?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I remember that, yeah.
L:  I think that was on TV. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come to think of it I guess that was on TV.  I guess that --
L:  [NOISE] Seems a long time ago now.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  And that was --
R:  -- it does seem like a very long time ago, yeah.
L:  Yeah, it does with all the things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ever since nine one one everything seemed a long time ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yep.  Yeah, yeah.  But, uh, yeah, I think that one was on trial too and he also brought out, uh, Paula Jones that he had sex with her and, uh --
L:  That's right too.
R:  Yeah, and somebody else and ... uh, her, uh, semen stained dress and tell everybody on the newscast on the television --
L:  Really?  I know.
R:  -- and radio that stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And you know, you think, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that eventually that they would be able to go back and have another trial and, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- that -- that when you start talking about one thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it'll lead into a whole bunch of other things --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and then that can go back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Once he's -- he's talked about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, uh, or the women have, they can go back and these --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- trials can go on forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wonder if there's a trial channel on TV?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  The court trial channel.  That would be cool.
R:  [LAUGH] I think there would be.  I think there is, uh, or could be but I'm not sure about that, you know.
L:  With all the cable companies now or --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the channels with all the channels I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sure that you could --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- find a bit of everything.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, [SIGH] how much time we've got.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Is this your -- your, uh -- have you been doing this for a long time?
R:  Um --
L:  Talking about topics?
R:  No.  No, this is, uh, just the first time for me.
L:  Is it, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is actually the third time for me too.
R:  O- oh, really?
L:  Uh, within just a few days so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's actually kind of interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, it is interesting.  It's very interesting.
L:  Depends on the topic.  Boy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yesterday's was good but I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- crime trials on TV?  Um --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I -- I -- personally I don't think that they should -- they should do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's just a way to make money.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And some are [inaudible] pay system TV time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then eventually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe make some products out of it like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's all about money it seems, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It's certainly not about justice.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Cause if it was justice they'd --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- keep it in a -- in a courtroom and go -- and there wouldn't be any performing for cameras or dressing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for the cameras and all that stuff.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's -- I heard that a lot of that went on.
R:  Yeah, that's so --
L:  And they would criticize somebody's dress and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their shirt and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the people -- the lawyers coming in to court with -- dressed a certain way and [SIGH] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  My goodness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's almost like it was nothing to do with the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the trial itself anymore.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.  That's very true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN] Yeah --
L:  Boy, oh, boy. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think they did do that.  They, uh, dressed for the courts and they performed for the courts and ... yeah.
L:  That's right and there was some ... some changes --
R:  Y- -- yeah.
L:  I guess that Marcia Clark, that was the one that came in near the end, eh?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  And, um, they ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I think she's probably famous now just from doing that on television, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  They write a book and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do all kinds of stuff.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  What do you think about the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oh, I forgot what I was [LAUGH] gonna say.  I think we've covered that pretty thoroughly anyway.  My goodness.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think when, uh, ten minutes are up, like, w- we have, like twenty seconds where --
L:  Yeah, a voice comes on.
R:  Yeah, yeah, she comes on or --
L:  And -- and lets us know.
R:  -- or somebody comes on.
L:  Yeah, so we just keep talking about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For a little while.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah and --
L:  Must be pretty close.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Well, at least we're in the same -- same time zone.  We see the same things on television.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  We see the same trials.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true, yeah.  Yeah.
