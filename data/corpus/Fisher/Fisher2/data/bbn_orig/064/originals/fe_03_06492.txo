R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, uh --
R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  My name's Diane.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um ... hi, so how do you feel about today's topic?
R:  Um, I actually have watched Court TV.  We get Court TV on our cable.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I have watched it.  I did watch, uh, O.J. Simpson's trial on Court TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've watched, um, a little bit of the Lyle Menendez[?] on, uh, Court TV.
L:  I watched, um, some of the O.J. coverage, not on Court TV but just on regular television.  Personally I think it's a good idea, uh, t- to televise, um, trials.  Um, as long as it doesn't interfere with the process itself.  It's part of being public, you know?  Uh, our --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- courts being public.  I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
R:  Oh, neither do I, plus I find it extremely fascinating.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's like --
R:  It's just like all this stuff and -- uh, but the thing is that, um, when you look at regular TV you see like a court thing like The Practice and stuff like that, you see a few little things, but I mean, when you're watching, say, Court TV and -- and televised stuff, I mean, there's interruptions all the time!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just like it is -- it doesn't finish in an hour and ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um, I -- I really -- I really enjoy it and I think that it is part of the freedom of -- of speech is that we're allowed to see what's going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just kinda wonder -- I don't know where you live.  I'm in Southern California --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, we have a trial that possibly will be shown on Court TV if it ever gets to that stage which I'm -- I'm pretty sure it is.  It's a thing for Lacy Peterson.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um ... [MN] that's gonna be interesting.
L:  Yeah, oh, I live in Iowa so I'm -- I'm --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- quite a bit [inaudible].  We're just starting to warm up.  You guys are pro- hot there [LAUGH] already.
R:  Actually I live right toward the beach so we've been kind of overcast all day.
L:  Oh.
R:  But inland has gotten quite hot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, that's why a lot of people, uh, you know and -- and here, I don't know where -- what -- about where you are but, um, the Court TV channel's on the cable channels.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so we can watch them from home which is wonderful. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not just -- just on -- you know, like, um, Dateline or whatever, you know, when they show on -- on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- TV for an hour or whatever.  I mean, you can watch the whole trial from -- from the time, um, that they start then they break for lunch --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- then they go onto other programming and then they go -- I think that it's -- I think it's a very good idea.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think -- well, Court TV isn't part of our basic cable that you get here.  Um --
R:  Uh, see, it is for us.
L:  It's something you'd have to -- you have to order extra I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.  But I -- I've -- so I've never seen the Court TV but I think it would be interesting to -- to watch and I have, like I said, I've watched parts of the O.J. trial and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Quite a lot of it actually.  [LAUGH] I mean, at the time it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was really interesting, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what was going on but, uh, um ... I don't know.
R:  And -- and it kind of -- it kind of gives you to see the things that can go right and can go wrong --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when they're trying to investigate something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then take it to trial because with O.J. he got off on a lot of technicalities that they didn't do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or that they didn't follow up on.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, stuff like that and that's what -- what turned -- turned the tide for him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, we have, like I said, this one for, um, Lacy Peterson.  Her husband is, um, in jail, um ... um, she was eight months pregnant and she, uh, was dumped in, uh, San Francisco Bay --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um ... like, uh, three months later the baby's body washed up and then her body washed up and --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- evidently it had been tied down --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, in a harbor where he said that he was gonna go fishing.
L:  W- h- --
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] That sounds pretty --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- suspicious. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, already that's kind of -- and then there's -- you know, then there's these things about, you know, um, uh, you know, was he there?  Did anybody see him and people are saying, "Well, it was too rough to fish because it was, um, Christmas Eve".  This happened on Christmas Eve of all days.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um ... [LIPSMACK] then ... people saw him; some people didn't see him, you know, and stuff like that and it's, you know, all the stuff that'll come out in trial.  I would really like to watch it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because even though I live in southern California, there's still a lot that I don't know about the case.  I mean, they put a gag order on it of course.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they still talk about it.  I mean, now in, uh, People they're gonna do a spread of, you know, him as a child, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Little pictures of him as a cute little boy.  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Give -- kids grow up and they do bad things. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  They can be the cutest little kid --
L:  [COUGH] Mhm.
R:  -- but, you know, watch- watching all this stuff and watching the attorneys, you know, and all -- all the things that they talk about, um, you know, while the -- there's a lot of stuff that goes on while the jury is not inside the court and you don't get to see that normally.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  You know, if you're on the jury you don't get to see that but on Court TV you [LAUGH] get to see that!
L:  Oh, so it does -- it does more than just broadcast the trials and --
R:  Right and then there's some things that are very relevant and that they will not allow the jury to hear.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, the jury doesn't get to hear some of the stuff.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know, which is kinda bad.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, but I mean, it's a ju- -- you know, the court's decision.
L:  Right.
R:  And this is the kinda stuff that, you know, I like to see when I -- when I'm watching is just like, oh God, why couldn't they get that to go or you know stuff like that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I mean, sure it's very frustrating for them but, you know, for the people at home it's just like, no, no! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, how does -- how does that work then on Court TV?  Do they, um -- do they televise a trial like all day long or do they --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  That's all they do is they televise -- all they can televise if it's a high profile case, they will televise it until the actual time comes for them to announce the verdict.  You know, day in and day out like I said, they will break for lunch and then they'll put something else on or they'll have commentators or whatever but then they come in and, you know, when they come back from lunch then they show from the lunch down, you know, 'til the time for them to leave.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, it's -- it's really interesting and our -- our basic cable came with it but there are packages that, you know, will include it -- p- you know, cause they have other channels on there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- but it's just very interesting and there's, you know, cases that -- that, um, are, you know, from other -- like from the east coast or from the Midwest and, you know, not just here.  It's just wherever it happens to be that they're -- they're gonna televise it.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  So, I think that's, you know ... that's the part of the, um ... um, what -- what is the word that I'm trying to say?  The mystique about getting o- and seeing is that you're not really sure until you, you know, turn it on where this trial is being held and what the -- the thing is, you know, because they have like a -- I don't know whether you get it on your TV but there's a -- a program here, it's called Crime and Punishment?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it usually is just a summer filler and it is an actual trial b- but it's only one hour program.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it talks about, you know, what happened and -- and stuff like that.  And that's interesting too because those are real life cases also.
L:  Mm mhm.
R:  You know, but they -- of course they've been televised and --
L:  But they condense them and -- they condense them into just an hour show?
R:  Right, right.  And Court TV will go until it -- it, um, you know, it ends.  From the beginning to the end and, you know, some -- some of course do not want it on Court TV so you won't see it on Court TV and it won't be televised.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, you know, like I said, the O.J. thing was just astounding to watch.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, cause there was a lot of stuff that they would not let the jury hear that was really relevant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um ... and it's sad [LAUGH] you know, in a way cause it's like, oh God, you know, I wish they would have been able to hear this and of course a lot of people afterwards, you know, when they got to see all this stuff, you know, said, you know, we would have co- voted completely different had it been for the fact that we would of been able to hear this -- this, uh, you know, this person testifying or this kind of evidence that wasn't put in --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or not allowed to be presented and stuff like that so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think it's -- yeah, I think it's a really good thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if it -- if -- if they're looking for it to deter crime.  I doubt very much it would do that.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's interesting to see some of these things.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I think -- I like the idea or the aspect of if you're helping to keep trials public, you know, because trials are -- it's important that trials be public, you know?
R:  Yeah, well, they used to be a long time ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, in, um ... you know, uh, when they first started trials and stuff like that.  Was always public.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they'd have a big old square and they'd have all these people and -- and whatnot and -- and then they would go ahead and, you know, pronounce judgment and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah I think --
R:  They still are public but I mean there's -- there's some that -- that, uh, like the O.J. one you only have to make people that are loud in the courtroom and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, you know, people line up for hours to get in a band.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  To get in.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, that's the way it is on some of these things. 
L:  Yeah.  Uh, I -- I liked the idea of it -- well, I mean, it's important that it's public because we're not -- you know, it keeps ... j- justice can't be done in secret, you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  [MN]
R:  And it lets some old things come out that may or may not have been done too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, the sad thing is, like, O.J. you know, um, they found him guilty.  Now, whether he -- I mean, guilty.  They found him innocent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know r- regardless of whether he was guilty or not and he can never be tried again for murder so --
L:  Mhm, because of [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's, uh, [SIGH] it's -- it's really interesting to watch a -- you know, it's too bad that it's not offered back there cause it is very interesting and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the thing is it's on twenty four [LAUGH] hours!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you get to see some of the tape from during the day of -- you know, once it goes off, you know, the regular stuff goes off.  They'll televise other trials and stuff like that so --
L:  Mm mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's very interesting.
L:  Now, do they focus mostly on crimes or is it also on just, like, cases that might be of -- of, um, particular legal interest or --
R:  No, mostly it's trials.
L:  Trials?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm mhm.
R:  Murder trials and, um, um, you know, carjacking stuff and what not.
L:  [MN]
R:  Some of it is just, uh, mediocre stuff but a lot of the stuff is the big stuff. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, some of the stuff like you -- you have not heard of Lacy Peterson.  It's a real big thing out in this area.  You know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- on Court TV if they were to televise it you would know about it because it would be on Court TV.
L:  Right.  [MN]
R:  And you would hear about, you know -- you wouldn't know all the background because you don't, you know, read the papers every day that we read and stuff like that.  Although it's in the Enquirer so --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know -- do you [LAUGH] guys get the Enquirer back there but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] -- it's, you know, plastered all over the Enquirer and all this other stuff --
