L:  Hi there.
R:  Hello, my name is Jimmywa[?]
L:  Hi, I'm Renee.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Atlanta.
L:  Atlanta.  Oh, goodness I'm over here in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
R:  W- wow!  [several inaudible words]  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Well, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I heard the question kind of briefly.  My machine was on low.  I guess they're asking us about a terrorist attack.
R:  Yeah.  They -- they said, uh, how do you think that most people would act, um, during a terrorist attack.  And, like, would they re- remain calm or become nervous.  And how do you think that you would act.
L:  Wow, what do you think?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it -- it [LAUGH] was funny, it's almost a sort of -- to me, in my opinion, it's almost a silly question.  I think, like, if anything with the -- I don't -- well, you know what, I'm thinking of, like, something, like, you're own back yard.  Now, when it's in your own back yard it's something totally different --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- versus on the other side of the county, you know.
L:  That's true.
R:  So ...
L:  It's true.  Yeah, I wasn't anywhere near -- I was here in -- in Albuquerque you know, when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- September eleventh happened so ... 
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, but still it -- I -- I don't know, we have a lot of things out here that have to do with nuclear power.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, people kind of get nervous, like, about Los Alamos Labs and, you know, some of our airforce bases and things like that.  We have -- we have uranium mines out here and, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um, for the most part w- we don't have to worry about it, you know, unless like you said, it's in your own back yard.
R:  Yeah, but I think most people --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- would probably, you know, panic, I mean, who witnessed, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people wi- -- I mean, y- you -- it would be impossible to avoid -- it may be on every station, every radio.  I mean, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you go outside, people will probably be, you know, acting, you know, you kn- -- running around, you know, going to the grocery store --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all that sort of stuff I mean, I just -- 
L:  I -- I've -- I've seen the pictures, you know, all those pictures we saw of September eleventh and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just the looks on peoples faces.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they looked so freaked out.  You had these businessmen who were, like, covered in, you know, soot and ashes and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that whole scene was just pretty amazing to me; all these professional people working in downtown, you know, New York --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, argh, I can't even imagine.  I -- I'm kinda scared, like, for this memorial day weekend, you know, that something could happen because didn't they put us on an orange alert a couple of days ago?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's kind of freaky.  Some of us have been talking about it here, you know, at work and wondering, you know, what's -- what's going to happen with all of that, but ...
R:  You're not, ah, like you say, it's -- it's crazy --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, I mean --
L:  It is crazy.
R:  -- the good thing about it is you -- you really can't do anything.
L:  No.
R:  You really can't prepare enough for it; you really can't take enough precautions or anything of that nature so as long as, like, you just have to sit back and choose --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, pray it doesn't happen.
L:  And try and -- I think that we each have to try and live our lives as best we can.  It's -- it's kind of like they win if we stay home, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  If we don't go to things or, you know, if you don't go to some Memorial Day parade or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- some fireworks display or something, it's like they've won.  But, you know, I always look to the people -- to me I look to the people of Israel and [LAUGH] they're a good example of how you just try and carry on as best you can, you know.
R:  Yeah.  You're right.
L:   [NOISE] You never know when some crazy, you know, thing is going to happen and there's going to be an explosion, you know, a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- suicide bomber or something but ...
R:  I know.  Like in this day and age you really do just, you know, tomorrow's definitely not a prime issue.  You know, there's -- it's -- it's entirely too much happening.
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  Out- outside of, like, the whole terrorism thing, you know, that other star issues entirely too much so -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um, but ...
L:  And there's just -- there's just so many -- there's so many variables.  You know, there's [LAUGH] so many things that could happen each day.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  You know -- 
R:  You know, like I say y- you can -- you can never do enough.  You can't say --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- well, I mean, even, like, simple stuff or I'm -- I'm not going to go here, or I'm not going to drive this fast, or I'm not going to switch lanes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm not going to -- you know, whatever this, I don't know.
L:  There's no accounting for the other guy, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  You don't know.  We have a horrible problem out here with drunk driving, um, people, you know, get drunk and drive their cars and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're, like, third or fourth in the nation and we've -- we've been up there with, like, ser- -- second and maybe even first place before --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- you know, with the number of fatalities.  But that's the thing, I mean, you can be as prepared as you are so, you know, like, some of my friends say, "Oh, I'll go out and I'll just have one or two drinks".  It's, like, "Well, yeah, you only --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- have one or two but y- -- you know --" 
R:  The guy that --
L:  "-- the guy who gets --"
R:  -- the other guy --
L:  -- yeah, "The guy who gets behind the wheel is driving next to you, how may did he have first?"
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  No.
R:  So, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- issues, I don't know.  It's crazy and, like, this whole terrorism [several inaudible words] oh, my gracious.  This whole war thing --
L:  I know.
R:  -- oh, my gracious, oh, no [inaudible]. 
L:  Today is my birthday so, I thought it was one of my family members calling.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, happy birthday!
L:  Thanks
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  I'm forty one.
R:  Wow!  What did you do for your birthday?
L:  Um, I taught -- I'm a schoolteacher.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  But it -- it's the next to last day of school so, um, it was kinda wild because we had a pool party at it -- they -- they have a country club here and they had it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- closed this whole week so they could have pool parties for different schools --
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  -- and we went to that country club and that was really fun.
R:  Yeah, sounds like fun.  Pool -- 
L:  Yeah, fifth graders.
R:  Oh, really, you really like it?
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  How long have you been doing this?
L:  Oh, this is, like, my fourth year teaching, about third year teaching fifth grade.
R:  Okay.
L:  I like it a lot.
R:  Okay, what did you do before teaching?
L:  Oh, gosh, this that and the other thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh.  Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.
L:  A little of this and a little of that.  I mean, everything under the sun.  You wouldn't even be able to [LAUGH] keep up if I started.
R:  I see.
L:  What about you?  What do you do?
R:  Well, right now I'm, like, in betw- -- I'm not in between jobs, I work at a, uh, property management company.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, I've done -- I was like a [several inaudible words] for a while --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- going back and forth doing a little bit of everything, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I graduated last May --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- so, you know --
L:  Good.
R:  -- I'm trying to decide what do I want to do when I grow up.  That's a hard question.
L:  Yeah, really?
R:  Well --
L:  [LAUGH] Did you graduate college or high school?
R:  College.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah, the University of Georgia.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, this is hard.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know.
L:  No, I know, I didn't figure out what I wanted to do until I was [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [MN] thirty and then I tried high school teaching first, and then I went off for a couple of years and did some other stuff, and then I went back and said, "I might do elementary" so ...
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  But I like it.
R:  -- education seems, you know, things are great, like, [several inaudible words] and I were laughing not so long ago, it's like education is [several inaudible words] like I have aunties and uncles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and cousins and my mother's in education, my father was in education --
L:  Yep. My mom and dad too.
R:  Yeah, so it's, like, you know, why not.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It seems like, you know, I don't know, we'll see come this time next year where I am.  
L:  Yeah, th- --
R:  It may be in education, I don't know.
L:  -- there's not a lot of jobs where you can, I don't know, have the flexibility that we have and, you know, like tomorrow the kids leave at twelve thirty after an awards assembly and, whammy [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- we're free for ten weeks.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, like, that's like --
L:  That's kinda nice.
R:  -- that's great.  You know, you never have to worry about taking time off for vacation and stuff, you get the whole summer and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, Christmas break you get the [inaudible] me --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, spring break.  You -- I mean, you just can't ask for too much more, you know.
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of benefits to it.
R:  A lot.
L:  Lots of benefits.
R:  A lot.  And if you like kids then, you know, the only pitfall, because I'm sure a lot of people say well, I don't know if I can deal with kids but, I mean, if you like kids then, you know, there's really no -- no -- no true downfall --
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  -- to education, you know
L:  No, I agree, I agree.  It's, uh, you know, if you -- if you enjoy kids, you know, hopefully you -- [NOISE] you've got a good principal and, you know, some good parents, because that -- that could make your life miserable.  But, you know, for the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- most part, um, if those things are all right then you're fine.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know I'll have -- I'll have to go back to school or take some more classes or something but I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm definitely considering it.  And then -- then I realize you can move, you know, I never thought about the progression --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in education, you know, where you move up, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  You can become an administrator or you can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, do something else in -- in the main office of your school district.  Oh, yeah, there's lots --
R:  Never thought about that --
L:  -- there's lots to do.
R:  -- I just always thought of a teacher.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, you don't have to be a teacher forever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Or you can change and be a different kind of teacher for a few years if you want to --
R:  Yes.  I mean --
L:  -- or you know, people take breaks to have kids and stuff and it's got a lot of flexibility that a lot of my friends who work in offices don't have.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean, is -- if -- see education's going to always be there, unlike --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- many other corp- -- you know, careers and professions you may choose.  Education will definitely -- it's not going anywhere.
L:  No.  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just like -- it's like food, people always have to eat, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- it's always going to be there.  I've done so many food service jobs I can't even tell you.
R:  Really?
L:  But -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Time I wait -- made my way through college.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!  I always --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- wanted to be a waitress but --
L:  I wonder about these phone calls, whether or not they, like, I don't know how they score it.  I mean, what are they --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- looking at?  Are they looking at our language?  Or --
R:  I don't kn- -- I -- you know --
L:  -- or whether or not there's a topic?  Or [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly.  Me and this other guy, we were, like, there probably, like, they give you a topic, but they just want to see, like, you know, probably something silly like people's attention span or something.  It's like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a smokescreen the actual topic.  But I mean -- 'cause I mean we talked about terrorism for, like, maybe, like, five minutes or so.
L:  Three, five minutes, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and now it's like we've just drifted off.  Like, the other guy that I was on the phone -- we talked maybe, like, twenty, like, I say a minute.  Other than that [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it was [several inaudible words]. 
L:  What was your subject that you had to talk about?
R:  Um, we talked about, uh, what was it, the television stuff, ah, reality shows.
L:  Oh, reality TV?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I talked to this woman, she w- -- she'd only been from China --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- she was -- her husband was studying and she'd been in America for nine months and she spoke really pretty good English.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] she and I had to talk about pets and, uh, you know, like, ah, do you want to have a pet?  Do you have any pets?  You know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- all these different things, and I was racking my brain trying to think of things to say.
R:  I know, you can only talk so long about certain things. 
L:  Finally I just started asking her questions about China.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, well, this is more interesting.  Maybe we won't get paid --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- for this but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Did you hear about it from the Get Paid Network?
R:  Actually I heard through someone else, but Get Paid Network is -- what is -- exactly what is that?
L:  Yeah, I think that's the name of it.  I think it's Get Paid dot com, or Get Paid Network dot com --
