R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Lucy calling from New York.
R:  Oh!  Well, I'm from south central Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.  What's your name?
R:  Dorothy Clantince[?].
L:  Oh, nice to meet you.
R:  Yes.
L:  What do you think about the topic today?  Televised criminal trials?
R:  Well, I don't really think that it ought to be televised. [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] I've never seen one.  Have you ever watched one?
R:  Well, all I've ever seen is, like, your murder trials and all that.  I guess it would be the same.  Like, your ods- -- uh, Simpson and all that, you know? 
L:  Oh, I didn't watch that.
R:  OJ?
L:  No, did you?
R:  Well, I -- you couldn't hardly help but watch part of it if you turned your TV on, there it was. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, back then I didn't watch much TV and I still don't now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I really don't believe it [SIGH] -- you know, that -- I'm not for airing everything on TV.  You know, I think that ought to be a private matter amongst the victims and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their families.
L:  I agree too.  It should be kept private.
R:  Yes, and I really don't think they can get a true accurate trial with it being on televised -- vision.
L:  Oh, do you think that's because the jury, um --
R:  Is nervous.
L:  Mm.
R:  And they're being televised and they --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- think, "Well, the whole world will know who I am" and --
L:  You're right.  Yeah, it [inaudible] --
R:  But, um, you know, thinking [LAUGH] ... you know, 'cause they show everything and I just don't think for the family members that's left behind ... you know?
L:  Yeah, you're right.  I didn't think about it in those terms because I've never watched one on TV.  I've never watched an entire ... broadcast.  I watched the news clips of the OJ Simpson trial and I don't remember ... seeing any jurors but, you're right, like, in order to get their full participation.
R:  Well, yeah, I -- and then --
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  -- it showed, like her bloody scene.  They didn't show the body but they showed the mess and all of this and I don't think it was fair to the children.
L:  Oh, they showed the glove, is that w- --
R:  They showed the blood out on the cement and the gates and the ... different things, you know?  And I just don't think that's fair to the victims' families ... you know, for it to be [SIGH] brought out for everyone to see.
L:  Right.
R:  I think it should be held more ... privately and, uh, in a courtroom and that's where it should be.  If you wanna watch it ... go to the courtroom and see it.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know why anybody would be ... interested in seeing something, you know, that doesn't really concern them.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I just don't understand it neither, you know?  Have you got young children or ...?
L:  No.  No children and I --
R:  Well, I had two.  I have four granddaughters and one great granddaughter.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I'm expected a second great granddaughter next January.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God, congratulations.
R:  Or great grandchild.  I don't know what it will be.  [LAUGH] But, yes ...
L:  Wow, so you're gonna seem really happy.  We -- you said, your ... you think it's a granddaughter?
R:  I don't know for sure what it's gonna be, you know?
L:  Oh.
R:  It -- so ... [SIGH] uh, an- this here is ... [SIGH] just too much and I think that the young people today that's watching all of this, they learn from TV how to do different things.
L:  Mm, yeah, they lear- -- yeah, when they sensationalize all the details.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All the gory details, it gives --
R:  Uh-huh.  Sh- --
L:  -- other people ideas that they normally wouldn't have thought of.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  I think a ... they learn an awful lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they shouldn't be learning.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I also just don't think that these trials are very interesting.  Like, these gory criminal trials --
R:  No, I don't neither.
L:  -- aren't considered entertainment.  I don't know why any broadcaster would be interested in ...
R:  That's news.
L:  -- in airing it.
R:  That's news.
L:  Maybe they've run out of news and maybe that's why they show it.
R:  Y- yes and just like your -- the wars and all of that.  Well, that's ... okay but if it was me and my son was over there or my daughter, do you think that I'd want to see them on TV, maybe getting shot at?
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  You know, I think television has gone just a little too far.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's pretty tasteless.
R:  Yes, and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just, u- uh ...
L:  Your --
R:  I don't know.  You just -- they just learn too damn much I think from [LAUGH] TV.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ha- -- I may be an old fuddy duddy but ... I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I wish more people were like you.  I wish more people shared your opinion. 
R:  You know, I [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, there's --
R:  B- I think they oughta go back to more the comedy type shows.
L:  Yeah, there's too much junk on TV.  It's really bad.
R:  Yes there is.  
L:  And it's really bad quality too.
R:  And your daytime soap operas, all it is is sex any more.
L:  Oh, those are the worst.
R:  That's all it is.
L:  Just the worst.
R:  And we have too much of that ... now.
L:  Yeah, that's why I barely watch TV. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- a lot of times I leave it on.  I've -- for noise.
L:  Yeah, well, I c- --
R:  More than -- you know, I'm not --
L:  Like the radio?
R:  -- watching all of it.  I'm just -- it's on for -- I'm here by myself and ... my husband passed away.  It'll be three years in July and, uh --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
R:  -- you know [SIGH] --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- you're sixty six years old so ... [SIGH]
L:  He was only sixty six you said?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, that's young.
R:  Yes it is.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Like, sometimes when I'm, um, doing housecleaning I'll keep the TV on but if it's really bad ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, like you said, like, daytime soap operas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or these criminal trials or those, like, cop shows --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I have no interest in either because they're really violent and --
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.
L:  Yeah, explicit then I'll just turn on the radio.
R:  Yeah, I really don't think that ... you know ... I just -- uh, I just don't believe in -- I know -- I've -- for myself if I was ... on jury trial --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they said it was being televised, it's bad enough to have to be on jury trial ... you know?
L:  Right, where the criminal could find out who you are or -- or they could --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- see who you are.  They might not be able to get your name and home address but they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- will remember your face.
R:  Oh, yes, yes.  But they can probably trace that down with the computer any day they want to.  These criminals are smarter than, uh ... [SIGH] than the average bear.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And they use it in -- they u- -- they use their ... uh, above average intelligence in bad ways.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They sure do, yeah.  And, uh, well, I just think that, uh ... some things ought to be kept private in this world.  And I think that's one of them.  That, uh ... it isn't everybody's business.  I mean, if you turn on the news you can find out on the news.  If it's a highly criminal trial you're gonna find out on the news ... what they got out of it.  You don't have to listen to the whole trial, you know, unless you're really into that.
L:  Right, and if you were really into it, you could do your own research.  Like, you'd go to the Municipal Courts and look up the court records if you --
R:  That's right.  Or else you could go to the court and sit through the trial as a ... uh ... [inaudible] person, you know, just wanting to listen to it and watch it.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause they do have seats there in th- -- in the courtroom.  
L:  Yeah, I guess that's more for law students or like, uh --
R:  Yeah.  Well, anybody really can go in there that wants to watch it, I think.  You know, that they just have to screen people so close for weapons and everything.  You know, a- and ... I -- I just don't -- I don't even like to be on jury. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, same.
R:  I don't like -- I don't like nothing to do with all of that stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  A few years ago, like, three years ago, I was called for jury duty and I was so close to having to serve either on a murder trial --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or a drug --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- related murder.
R:  Oh yes, I've been there too.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and neither of them sounded good.
R:  Yeah.  I was terrified.  I was terrified.  Because I ... knew some of the people that was on this drug trial.  They were, like, in the neighborhood and I'm thinking, "I don't wanna have to go up there and -- and listen to all this.  They're my neighbors".
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  You know?
L:  Oh, so did you tell them that you had that relationship?  Like, if you're too close to some of they won't --
R:  I had never -- I didn't even get called up at the front to be questioned.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, you're so lucky.
R:  But I had to sit there and listen to all this.  [SIGH] And then when they got their twelve jurors, well, then you could either stay and listen to the trial or you could go home.  Well, you know what I did.  I went home.  [LAUGH] I didn't want no part of it.  [LAUGH] But you can pick up your newspapers and everything and listen to the -- you know, and read about it if you're interested in it.  You don't have to take up all the stations with trials and everything.  There's too much of that now.  [SIGH] With your regular cops programs and all that, you get all -- all the information you need. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, too much.
R:  [LAUGH] Without having to tie up ... with all the trials and everything.  I talked to a man this morning from the Bronx.
L:  Oh, you -- you already participated once today?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that you could do that more than once in a twen- -- in one day.
R:  Well, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Or did they -- did they call you or did you call in?
R:  They called me once and then I had my [inaudible] up the eight hundred number and then they'd give you a -- a pin number and you have to use the pin number.  They can --
L:  Right, I -- Oh.
R:  You can do three calls, yeah.
L:  So, did they call you three ti- -- like, twice today or did you ...?
R:  I cal- -- they call me, uh, Thursday and then I made two calls today so then -- and I'll be done, you know?
L:  Oh, they called you twice today?
R:  No, I called in once.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then this is my second call today and, uh, that-a way it's all done then.  [LAUGH] Outta the way. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, good for you.
R:  Yes, but  --
L:  So, what else was the topic besides televising --
R:  It was just, uh --
L:  High prof- -- was it high profile only or any criminal --
