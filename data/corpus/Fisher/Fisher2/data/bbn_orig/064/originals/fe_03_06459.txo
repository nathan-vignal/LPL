L:  Hi, my name is Regina Ewing.
R:  Hi, I'm Erica.
L:  Hi, Erica.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] Did you watch the O.J. trial?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] a little bit of it; not a lot.
L:  Uh-huh, me too.  Um, I really -- I -- I really don't think trials should be, uh ... [SIGH] a forum for entertainment.
R:  I -- I agree.  Not entertainment.  That -- but I do think, um, the public needs to be aware of things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't think they need to get as much coverage as they get usually.
L:  I agree, yeah.  It, um ... uh, it almost comes like American Idol.  [LAUGH] You know, the reality -- reality TV and people are so curious about things that are real but it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it takes -- I think when they televise a trial, the judge changes how he responds.  I don't -- or she doesn't ... you know, and the prosecutors and the attorneys, you know, get ready for the camera more than for the trial, I feel.  I just -- I don't think they should allow 'em to be fully televised.  Maybe they should make a record, a televised record, so things could be looked at later if, um, if there's any question about whether or not it worked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or it was correct but I really think when you get the public involved, um ... in --
R:  It changes things?
L:  I think so.  I really do.
R:  I never even thought about it that way but I think you're right because ... they would spend more time worrying about how they looked or things like that than actually preparing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the trial.
L:  I think so and that's certainly not ... the way [SIGH] -- I mean, if I were on trial [LAUGH] I sure wouldn't want that to happen.  I'd want them to look at the evidence and ... and focus on me [LAUGH] instead of on the public.
R:  True.
L:  Public response.  And the, uh, the people who are ... you know, buying the ad time, I -- I guess the ad time for that trial really sold for big bucks.  So, you know, it's -- it's a non ... produced -- well, a- actually, it was produced because the cameras had direction, um, but it -- it was a very cheap way for -- and I can't remember if it was on ABC, NBC or which -- which network but I think it's cheap programming for them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They get the advertising dollars but they don't have to do any outlay of funds. 
R:  I agree.  I never even thought about it that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's -- that's a really good point.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.
L:  And I -- I find when I [LAUGH] watch those things, you know, I -- occasionally -- I'm not home enough to watch it regularly but occasionally I've seen Judge Judy.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some of those ... those kind of things and I ... I think it's [SIGH] ... it's useful information for people to see how the law works but ... when it's something really serious ... you know, like a murder trial ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I just think it's -- it's too sensationalized when it's televised.
R:  True and some people who are like witnessing or whatever, if it was, like, a murder trial, I know I wouldn't want to be put on TV.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  I -- it would make me -- I don't know, it'd make me ... act a little bit differently maybe.
L:  Mhm.  Trial by media. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and [LAUGH] you want to be fair ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to everyone and I don't think putting it on TV is making it fair.
L:  I think so too.  You think anybody'll pay attention to what we're saying? [LAUGH]
R:  I hope so because I never even thought about it that way.  I thought it was like, um, getting information but I didn't ... I don't know.  I didn't always agree with it because ... the people really are put on the spot and i- I don't know.  They did act a little bit differently but now I ... I can see why that would be a bad thing instead of more use with ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- useful, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it's more harmful ...
L:  Oh, I think so too.  So --
R:  -- than helpful, yeah.  They should make a record so it can be looked at but I -- I wouldn't put it on ... in the media.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Oh ... [NOISE] I was trying to think of what other -- I know, um, when the media covers stuff prior, like this ... Peterson thing in California where the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the wife -- are you from California?
R:  No, I'm from Georgia.
L:  From Georgia?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't have a southern accent.
R:  Oh, I know because I moved, um, here five years ago from Chicago so ...
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.
R:  [LAUGH] That would be why.
L:  [LAUGH] I see.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, are you hearing anything in Georgia about the California trial or the California murder case?
R:  Um, not a whole lot.  It's pretty much, you know, not much.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just that there is one but not -- I don't even know what it's for really.
L:  I see.  I guess maybe all of the ... uh, the networks handle it but maybe they don't show it in different parts of the country so much, or probably in the west is ... where they see it the most.
R:  Yeah, but I also don't watch TV a lot because I think there aren't a lot of good things on TV worth watching.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I don't watch TV a whole lot so maybe that could be it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I try to watch the news ... uh, to keep up with what's happening but, um ... I go home from work, I'm so tired I just sit down and ... zone out.  And it's not the best way to zone out.  I should put on some good music [LAUGH] instead.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.
L: Yeah, 'cause you're --
R:  But it -- it's good to know what's going on.  We need to have some so- -- form of, um ... [LIPSMACK] you know, what's going on in the world.  I think that's helpful.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  But I think sometimes it -- it's just depressing because you don't hear a lot of good things on the news.
L:  [NOISE] Well, people don't tend to be so interested in good things.  [NOISE] I think ... I think the media goes after what piques people's interest.  It's kind of ... y- you know, which way do you go?  Are -- are you -- as the media, are you covering this because you think this is what people will like or is this what people like because you're covering it?  It's hard to know, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which way it goes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um ... yeah, I really ... I think we need to do a lot more in our society to be more, um ... positive.  And certainly stuff on war sells.  You know, the [COUGH] -- the way they covered the Gulf -- not the gulf war, the Iraqi war this time, was just mesmerizing. You know, there wasn't anything else on -- on CNN.  Any time you turned it on you were -- you were in the war zone.
R:  Yep.  Yeah.
L:  And I guess, you know, it's important for people to know how ... difficult that is, especially people who've never been in that situation but it can become mind numbing.
R:  Yeah because they show graphic images of people being burned and stuff like that and ...
L:  Mm.
R:  Like, have you seen some of it?  Just --
L:  N- --
R:  -- people dying, like ... oh!
L:  No, I haven't seen any of that.
R:  Oh, I have.  Like, there was one where this person was like shot in the head or something and, like, they were just bleeding on the ground.
L:  Well, this --
R:  I think that is -- they -- I don't think they should put those on the media --
L:  Was this --
R:  -- at all.
L:  -- the Iraqi?  In the Iraqi thing?
R:  Uh, yeah.  And then --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like I saw one where someone blew themselves up.  Like, I didn't see the actual blowing up but like ... they showed the person afterward and ... uh.
L:  Oh, I didn't see those.
R:  I did.
L:  No, I agree.  I don't think that's appropriate but it's so sensational, you know, the more -- it's like when people are driving past an automobile accident.  Everybody slows down to look, you know, it's -- it's part of our human nature unfortunately.
R:  Yeah, true.
L:  That we want to see all the icky stuff.  And -- and that's what the media jumps on.  That's what they use.
R:  True.  How can we make it more positive 'cause I'd really like to tender how -- mm.  I can't even think of anything that they could do to make it more positive because I know that sometimes I like to ... you know ... when a -- when a wreck happens, yeah, I -- I look and see.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't -- I don't know.  
L:  Well, it would take the will of the media to change 'cause I don't ... I th- [SIGH] they respond to money and their advertisers want to advertise -- put their advertising where they think a lot of people are gonna watch and they know that -- I mean, human beings being what we are, we like to watch wrecks.  We like to watch things that are awful.  May- --
R:  Yeah, but it -- yeah.  I- --
L:  Maybe it makes us feel better 'cause we're not part of it.  It's somebody else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  
R:  Yeah, it just makes me sad though.  I'm like, "Oh, why did that happen?" and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I think if the media changed and was a little bit more positive too I think people wouldn't watch as much but, um ...
L:  That'd be [LAUGH] a good thing. [LAUGH]
R:  It'd be -- yeah.  It'd actually be a good thing.  And it'd be, like, go out and do something. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.  But the -- the advertisers wouldn't like that.  They're in -- they're in it for the money so they wanna make money.
R:  Yeah.  Pretty much everything in this world goes down to the money.
L:  A lot of it, yeah.  That's unfortunate but true.  Um ... [NOISE] who is the person -- somebody on the radio, um, can't think of his name off hand, but he was saying ... the other day -- he -- he does commentary on these -- these kinds of things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he was saying that he thought people, um ... were more altruistic than the media gave them credit for.  Uh, especially people in America and people, um, that we were less motivated as a ... society by money than the ... other cultures think we are.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I was really glad to hear him say that.  I'm not sure it's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But [LAUGH] I was glad to hear that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And when you -- when you consider how much money is given to charities by people who are not wealthy in this country, I think part of that may be true.
