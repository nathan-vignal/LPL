R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good, how are you?  My name's Yvonne.
R:  Yvonne, I'm Sarah.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  And where are you located?
R:  I'm in the Bronx.
L:  Oh, I'm in Upstate New York.
R:  Upstate New York?
L:  Syracuse, yeah.
R:  Okay, what part?
L:  Syracuse.
R:  Syracuse, okay.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what did they say the topic was?
L:  Ah, terrorism, if -- I guess, how we think people would react and how we would react.
R:  Yeah, um, definitely would freak out.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Seeing as I'm in New York. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause already happened, um, people would definitely panic. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely.  I've seen it happen, so ...
L:  Mhm.  I think even though nine eleven happened, I think that people still don't expect it to happen.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Do you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, I don't think anyone's ever prepared, so of course ...
R:  No, you're never prepared enough.
L:  Right. 
R:  It's always, like, in the back of your mind.
L:  Right.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  But, um, I think -- I mean, I've never obviously been in that situation, but I think that when -- once you're in the situation, I think you panic, but at the same time there's gotta be, like, some kind of adrenalin kicking in or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, where you get, like, super powers [LAUGH] or I don't know what.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just hear about those things happening, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  -- so ...
R:  Seriously.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know. 
L:  So ... I don't know how I'd react.  I think about that sometimes.  Actually, and it's really funny, is my husband was in the navy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and his specialization was chemical, biological and radiological defence.
R:  Okay.
L:  And this is ten years ago, when, like, terrorist attacks, who thought of a terrorist attack?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my husband used to say to me, "You know, we as a country are not prepared, we need to be more prepared".  And be -- I'd be just, like, laughing at him and say, you know, "It's not going to happen" kind of thing, you know, kinda thing.
R:  Never here, right, yeah?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I'd be like, "Okay, you're -- you're getting a little too, you know, that's -- that's something that yes, an [inaudible] has to be prepared for because it happens overseas", you know.
R:  Of course.
L:  That's what I was thinking, you know.
R:  That is so weird.
L:  Yeah, and then it happens, and he's like, "I told you so". [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, and he --
R:  Wow --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- that's so weird.
L:  But -- but really when you think about it, how prepared can you possibly be?
R:  I know --
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  -- it was so weird.  We were laughing at it because people down here were getting duct tape --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were getting duct tape and were getting, um, [inaudible] plastic wrap and we were, like, laughing at people, we were like, "And what is that going to save you from?"
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Exactly. 
R:  [LAUGH] What is that really gonna do?
L:  Exactly.  Well, my sister in law is in Brooklyn.  My husband's from Brooklyn.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My sister in law's in Brooklyn, she called, and whenever the last really high alert was down there, I don't know, was it two months ago or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- something like that, she called and was like -- 'cause she gets really panicky.
R:  Okay.
L:  She's like, "If something happens can we come stay up at your house?"  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I thought, well, you know, really if you get in that situation, you don't have time to react like that.  I mean --
R:  Not at all.
L:  -- there'll be, like, mass exodus from the city, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I [inaudible] --
R:  How far are you really going to be able to get?
L:  Yeah, exactly. 
R:  Luckily I wasn't right here when it happened, I was actually in -- you know where, ah, Lake Georgia is?
L:  Yep.
R:  I was up at the lake and, um, my son was down here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when it -- he was actually in Brooklyn --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I couldn't get him out, I couldn't get him out, I didn't know what to do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and nobody could get out of the city, everybody was freaking out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and nobody could get out, nobody could get in.  You know, it was like nobody knew what to do.  
L:  Right.
R:  Nobody had any idea what to do.  I mean, what can you do?
L:  Right.
R:  Except for panic, I mean, I -- I think that the police handled it well.  I think, you know, the firemen handled it the best that they could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that was basically it.  
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, what else [NOISE] could we do?  My goodness, as my son comes.  But that was -- yeah ... [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know what else to talk about on this topic.
R:  [NOISE] I know.  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We're pretty much talked out on that one. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Don't do that again.  
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, okay, every other day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they change the terror alert.
R:  [inaudible] here they do. 
L:  That's really silly.  You --
R:  [NOISE] That is too --
L:  -- know, I mean, if they change it from high to very high, I mean, re- -- in all honesty what are you going to do?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know. 
R:  My thing is too, is everybody's worried about flying now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, one, if they're going to do anything, I mean, how can we know, you know, what they're going to do?  And two, I mean, how -- not how can we know, but I mean, how high is our security now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you know?  I mean, like what could they possibly do now?
L:  Yeah, I know. [MN]
R:  They're, like, searching people's shoes --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- coming in and out of the airports now.
L:  I know, so --
R:  Do you know what I mean?
L:  No, I know, I mean --
R:  It would have to be something chemical.
L:  My -- I mean, my husband travels all the time, he's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gone now.  He's always flying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he complains all the time, the security is not up to par, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, wha- -- what else are they going to do?  That's my question to him and he's like, "Oh, you know, they'll say, "Okay, Sir, over here, I mean, to check your bag and everything".  He goes and they barely look in it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They just shove it aside.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm like, "What are they going to do, go through everybody's bag and take all the contents out?"
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, let's be realistic. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and the chances are so slim that is it worth it?
R:  Really.
L:  I don't know.  I don't --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- know. 
R:  -- goodness.  Just thinking about it now is freaking me out. 
L:  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  It's insane.
L:  I don't like to fly to begin with, but it has --
R:  No.
L:  -- nothing to do with that. 
R:  Mm mm, I've always had an issue with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've always -- just the idea of being up in the air.  If we're supposed to fly, God would have given --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- us wings, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] You know, I've always been nervous up in -- up in the air.
L:  Yep.  That's right. 
R:  [NOISE] But, um, yeah --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- panic or not, oh, this is so weird, this is my first time calling, so ...
L:  Oh, I did one the other day, this is my second one.
R:  Is it?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Ten bucks, I sit at home all day and why not?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... [NOISE] Wow ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  What else can we juice out of the conversation? [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  And I didn't even look at the clock, so I don't know how much more time we have.
R:  I don't either. 
L:  [MN] But, um --
R:  Let's see.  Hm -- okay, no awkward silences.
L:  Yes, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I got it. [LAUGH] Well, I was with a high school kid the -- the other day --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
L:  -- and the topic was hobbies and we -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hobbies, you think you have to get out of that than, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- terrorism, but we didn't. [LAUGH] We got to a certain point where we were like, "Okay, shall we start talking about personal things?" 
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know if that's kosher, but ... [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, all right.  Shh.  Sweetie --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's lovely, honey. [NOISE] But, um, yeah, so ... [NOISE] Terrorism. [NOISE] Mm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Sorry, sweetie.  I -- I don't know now. [NOISE] I wonder if they get a lot of that? [NOISE] Like, how mu- -- like, how much they can actually talk about? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sure they do. 
R:  Okay. [NOISE] But, um --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I wonder if they got all the Al Qaeda people yet? [NOISE] And I thought the war was over? [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I did too.
R:  And they're still fighting over there, right? [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I think they just have people there.
R:  Just have people --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- there to clean it up over there? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE] 
R:  [NOISE] I have no idea what's going on over there. [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I wasn't necessarily for or against the war, but I thought it was pretty silly --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people were so, like, drastically against it, as if there was no reason at all that we should be over there.  I mean, the guy's killing hundreds and thousands of his people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, not that it has to be our business, but who else's business is it going to be?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.  I was kind of -- okay, there we go, we have something to talk about now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was kind of against it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the sense that, like, no, it's not our business, but I was kind of against it in the fact that, like, I don't know, it wasn't -- okay, yeah, it wasn't our business and nobody else was -- was saying anything, but, yes, he was killing a lot of people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but -- but yet nobody was doing anything about it, okay.
L:  Yeah, that's what bothers me, why is it us?  It always has to be us?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  I mean, there's so many people over here that -- that -- that there's so much wrong over here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're spending so much of our own money --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- taking care of --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- other people's problems --
L:  That's absolutely right. 
R:  -- and we're suffering. 
L:  That's absolutely right.
R:  And we call this terrorism, right?  There's so much terrorism and yet there's so many people over here hungry.
L:  Yep.
R:  There's so many -- so many of our own people killing each other over here and there's, like, such an epidemic -- I mean, just in New York City alone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Of that going on every day, and they don't consider that a problem.
L:  Right.  Oh, you're --
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  -- absolutely right.
R:  It doesn't hit the -- the front page every day and --
L:  You're absolutely right.  I guess --
R:  You know --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- if it's a third world country then it's, like, oh my gosh, if you could see how many teenagers get killed every day because of guns.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know.
L:  That's right.
R:  But nobody seems to see that as a problem.  But then what -- what killed me is that we're bombing these places and we're killing innocent people.  We really were, I mean, even though they were targeted, pretty much pin pointed, but innocent people were dying.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Innocent people were dying. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe not as many as, like, the last war, but innocent people were dying.  But then we're dropping food for them, food and water --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, that was just so ironic for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just didn't get that at all. [LAUGH]  I was like, they were killing them and then we're going to give them food and water and blankets.  Hm, all righty then.
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know, the whole Bush administration, I'm --
