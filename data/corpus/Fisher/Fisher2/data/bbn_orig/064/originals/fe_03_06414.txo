R:  Hey.  My name is Patrick O'Rourke.
L:  Hi Patrick.  My name is Sarah.
R:  Hey, Sarah.  Okay, I guess we're supposed to talk about, ah, whether or not, ah, we would panic or, um -- actually the first few seconds I figured I would panic and, you know, start, you know, trying to figure out what to do and then it'd be like, you know, I've already thought about pretty much what I would do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, that would probably be something like, ah, figure out what the threat is.  Turn on the TV, the radio, whatever.
L:  I think that as long as I have something to do, like, people to take care of, whatever -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that, um, I'm fine.  But, just -- I notice the other day we had -- had -- I'm kind of famous in my family for being the person who stays calm in an emergency.  But, we -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- had a tornado over our heads the other day and as soon as I ran out of stuff to do, people to call and my pet to protect and so forth, then I got nervous 'cause there was -- I had no basement to go to so that -- 'cause I live in Florida so there was no -- there was nothing else I could do but just sit and wait and see if it was going to hit my house.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And that was when I got nervous.
R:  See, I live in Santa Monica, right near the beach.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the problem is, is that I have to deal with, ah, with a kind of, like, ah, how do you say it, ah, the fact that, you know, the nuclear power plant is not too far away.
L:  Oh, yikes.
R:  Yeah.  But, we do have shelters.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  So, since the nine eleven I have looked around and saw where my closest shelters were.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And dealt with those in that manner.
L:  How far would you have to drive?
R:  Ah, actually there's a library and a police department and a -- and a PD not too far away.  So, they're all within, ah, walking distance. 
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so, that's the thing that people most watch out there is -- is -- in -- in that -- I just talked to a girl a while ago who was from LA and she said she doesn't worry about the terrorists hitting LA because there's not any big specific target to hit.  But, she may not even know that -- where the nuclear power plants are.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know how it is?  It's sort of like it's -- they could and they couldn't and LAs big enough that it could create a panic.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, have you watched Twenty Four? 
L:  Yes.
R:  Just announcing that there's a bomb is worse than actually detonating a bomb.
L:  Yes.  That's probably true.
R:  Yeah.  And you create more panic by announcing that they're -- that they're doing this.
L:  Mm.  So, where is Santa Monica exactly?
R:  Ah, it's on the beach.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's between, ah, Malibu.  It's like halfway down the coast.
L:  I see.  Okay.  What's that noise I hear in the background?
R:  Oh, that's actually outside.  That's, ah -- I live right next to a bus depot.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  But, it's a real secure building.  It's got like, ah, really good, ah, dampeners.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Really well made.  So, when the doors close you can't hear a dang thing.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  The problem is I have to go ahead and, ah, dress a neighbour real quick.  But, I'm just telling him just to go ahead and give me eight minutes.  That's it. 
L:  [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, "If you can give me eight minutes because, ah, this is more im- this is more important because this is", you know?  [NOISE] Okay.  Yeah.  So, ah, basically with me it's dealing with, ah, with the fact that there ain't too many places to hide if it's a biological attack.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If it's somewhere else in the country then, you know, basically it's only keeping up in a- up information -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- just monitoring it and the fact that it works with a non profit, you know, it kind of helps.
L:  Yeah.  But, you probably want to think -- you -- pro- what kind of non profit do you work for?
R:  Ah, basically housing, ah, tenants rights also, um, um, basically victims.
L:  You'd probably end up having a lot of work to do is what would happen.
R:  Probably yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's the best thing for me to have.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Because I'm a really thinking person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm also a [several inaudible words] their personality.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I took -- I did an IQ test recently and it has to deal with the fact that I have a -- I have one of those, ah, math -- mathematician kind of a IQs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that -- on dates I'd sit back and let someone else make the move.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I'm very logically thinking.  I've very proactive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- otherwise.  So, it's really, really -- it's really, really about knowing what you can do first --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ahead of times thinking about it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that [inaudible], when the time comes you don't panic, you don't sweat, you don't worry.  You know, pretty much, you know, what you can do.
L:  Right.
R:  And if you can't do anything you can accept it then.
L:  Yeah.  It's a -- it -- my husband is a -- a -- a brilliant person.  He's got a genius IQ.  He's an electrical engineer.  But, he doesn't plan anything.  He's always -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is good most of the time.  He doesn't -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he -- there -- therefore he doesn't worry about things.  He's always in the moment and he's us- usually pretty happy and he doesn't obsess about stuff.  But, when something happens that you need to have had a plan for -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then he's glad he's got me around because I'm the planner.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] There you go.
L:  I also worry but -- but, you know, at least I've got a plan.  [LAUGH] --  
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, the thing is you can, um, people say that, ah, planners worry a little bit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I think it's actually the other way around.  I think the fact that we plan ahead -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- allows us not to worry on a day to day basis.
L:  Yeah, that -- that's -- that's the reason I do it, right -- 
R:  It allows us not to have that anxiety.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think that's really cool.
L:  Yeah.  But, then there are people who just don't think about it one way or the other and -- and, ah, um, as long as there's not something bad doesn't happen to them they're pretty happy.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  And so -- hello -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you have any pets that you would have to take care of in -- in a -- a -- a emergency?
R:  No.  Not at all.  I live in an apartment complex so there are no +pets -- pets allowed.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yeah.  That's how LA is a lot.
L:  I volunteer for, um, a -- an organisation with -- it's an organisation with an Humane Society.  It was started in Florida that goes in, ah, disasters and takes care of animals.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's amazing how many people who have animals, may have a plan for themselves and their children, but they don't have a plan for what to do with their animals.
R:  I just read an article as a matter of fact, yeah, um, talking about that.  They will risk their lives for their pets.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They will go -- they will stay there for their pets --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the Red Cross doesn't accept pets so they'll sit there at home in the middle of a flood or tornado or something -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- totally wasted house starving or, you know -- you know, being thirsty to the max, and they'll treat their dog or their cat like a -- like a child. They would take care of it first before themselves.
L:  That's -- it's -- it's, you know, there's -- you -- you see both ends of the spectrum.  You either see that or you see people completely take no responsibility for their animal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, and there's nothing in the middle.  But, what the Humane Society's trying to do now [several inaudible words] of America is, um, ah, create animal shelters -- peop- shelters where people can take their animals.  Either they leave their animals there and then go to the Red Cross shelter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, they also have shelters where people can go and be at the same shelter with their animals.
R:  Yeah, as a matter of fact, ah, the Humane Society gets a few bucks don't they?  To -- to go ahead and, like, ah, Red Cross, to go ahead and take care of animals.  So, they -- I heard that they were going to work with -- they were going to try to work with the Red Cross -- divert, ah, personnel and funds toward, ah -- toward, ah, maintaining, ah, animals at a location where Red Cross is.
L:  Last time I talked -- I mean, I -- we just went to a -- a three day course about this -- 
R:  That was just what I read.
L:  Yeah.  They -- they were -- and it -- it may depend -- it may be state to state also.  But -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the Red Cross down here is totally wants nothing to do with animals.  All they will do is say -- the best that we can do here -- because they have a lot of, ah, medical, um, health department type things that they have to follow -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, because they serve food and so forth -- is about -- they -- they said the best we can get them to do is to tell people who show up with pets where their pet friendly shelter is.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, but, um, it's -- it's interesting.  Th- there was never any kind of movement for that at all and then, ah, Hurricane Andrew, when it hit down in southern Florida, um, these people from the Humane Society who actually were up from Georgia, went down to Florida and just set up the first pet shelter really, um, in the country and then now they're -- they're trying to train people all over the country.  And some of those people actually went to, um, New York after nine eleven to take care -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of the dogs, ah, and stuff there -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm -- I could imagine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely.  I heard that there -- there was a residential district near there not just that -- not just that it was a working district but there was a near- nearby residential district that was affected.
L:  Yes.  Definitely.  There are a lot of buildings in that area cleared out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And of course there are a lot of -- you know, there -- there were a lot of residences in the twin towers.  Did you know that?
R:  I heard about that.
L:  Yeah.  There were a lot of apartments there.
R:  My friend actually, um, ah, he lived in the Sears Tower and I asked him about that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That they had, ah, ah, what do you call it?  Um, he's passed away now.  But, ah, he got shot at a gas station of all things.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  I'm sorry -- 
R:  Yeah.  But, he had a condo that he inherited from his folks.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I'm assuming that they have a lot of residences like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And at the top floors I believe it was the same as the Sears Tower, they had, ah, what do you call it?  Ah, they had radio towers.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  So, um, I'll bet you any money if they had radio towers in that building then, you know, you had some radio stations that just went out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which probably freaked people --
