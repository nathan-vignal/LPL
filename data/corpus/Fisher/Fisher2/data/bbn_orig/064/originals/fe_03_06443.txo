R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Kaleen[?].
R:  Hi, this is Lisa.
L:  Hi, Lisa.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm doing good.  Um --
R:  Uh -- 
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] well, this is my second and, um ... we need to talk about terrorism, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess ... do I think most people would panic?  I guess I would have to say yes.  In the middle of an attack I think that they would.  Um ... the typical average person, I think I would probably panic.  I think that, um ... uh, you know, i- the initial part of it and everything would be such a shock ... um --
R:  True.
L:  -- I don't know how you couldn't.  And I think that you would have -- I think it's -- it depends on, um, [SIGH] a couple of things.  I mean, uh, I'm, um ... a young mom of two girls so I just would be in fear for them and ... and just staying together as a family and their safety and -- and my husband's and stuff like that.  So, I guess if you, you know, had a family and stuff like that, you would have additional concerns of stuff that would make you ... really afraid. [LAUGH]
R:  True, true.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think, uh, having children -- I don't have children, but I think that when you do have kids ... you do have more of the fear factor because it isn't only yourself.
L:  Yes.
R:  And so, you know, for myself I say, you know, I think I would initially have fear ...
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then I think I might possibly be more focused because it is only me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I think it gives you a little bit more time to think about what's going on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  Assess the situation.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then do whatever it is you think is best.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I personally wouldn't, you know, I -- I would think I would be afraid because in this country ... I don't know if we're, uh, as alert really as we should be.  Even though we have the high warnings --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we still don't practice where our safety points are ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, you know, as other countries do so I think I might, you know, have a little bit more fear because of that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, just not prepared ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- for anything like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because we just assume that it's not going to happen to us.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm a New Yorker originally so ... you know, even when things do happen to us, we have a tendency to just go back into it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, as if it didn't happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if [LAUGH] definitely did, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Denial will not get you anywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um ...
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, I think that, you know, there's got to be an additional fear and panic because we aren't trained, we aren't informed on what ... to do.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh --
R:  And there are other countries that practice, "This is your shelter".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "And this is how you get to your shelter".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yes.
R:  You can tak- -- you know, and they -- they al- you know, they have it mapped out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And here I don't know why but we don't have that.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know?  And I think that would help us a great deal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Even if it wasn't that much for safety because how much can you do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  In an actual attack, at least it makes us ready --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so we're proactive, you see?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that changes the whole attitude.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, you know?  As far as when something happens so you don't get total panic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least you say you have some sort of plan.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, th- that would help us out a great deal. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- that's very true.  I think, you know, once -- once the initial stun of it in -- and everything is over too, I think that there can be different feelings as far as, um, if you have a belief or a faith system --
R:  Definitely.
L:  Um --
R:  I'm a Christian personally.
L:  I am too.
R:  So, I view -- [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  I view it differently, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because when it's over, it's over, that's ...
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know what I'm saying because of --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- there's nothing physically I can do about it, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  I just -- you know, I just have to give it to God.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, uh, that -- that's basically all that, you know, all that's taken care of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so I think you do view it differently, yeah, no.
L:  Oh, I think that, you know, um ... [LIPSMACK] I think that us as believers will really, uh, stand out in situations like that because we can have a certain kind of calm and peace about it knowing that who's in -- in control.
R:  In charge, yeah.
L:  And --
R:  There is someone.  No one -- no one else will really think that there is anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they won't have anything to go to, you know?
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  Which is unfortunate, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it is a relief to know that, you know, when all is said and done --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, we as believers do have someone to go to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know a- and that --
L:  And I think that we'll be strong for those, you know ... um, in situations like that who don't, uh, share that kind of --
R:  Yeah, I think so too and I think a lot more because of the recent things that have gone one, you have, uh, a lot of people who have become believers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a- and I think that, you know, I mean, I -- I think that's lasted, not just because of the initial thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You've had a lot of people start going to churches.
L:  Mhm.
R:  More than before so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that kinda like was a good outcome of it.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Speaking whatever, you know, kind of comfort that they can either way.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, yeah.  Well, I -- I ... don't -- I didn't really watch a lot on the TV after the nine eleven stuff.  I mean, I did watch some, um, and then this whole ... uh, war stuff, a- as a young mother I'm -- I'm very preoccupied.  But, you know, some -- sometimes I feel like the media shouldn't be so into all of those war and terrorist kind of things.  I think that we could probably give away some of that vital information --
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] definitely.
L:  -- by being too informed.
R:  Oh, oh, there's no doubt about it.  But that -- you know what?  I think that unfortunately is almost like the American way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know because we're not used to someone using our every single word against us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And we're sitting trying to play something fair.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they don't have [LAUGH] any concept of fair.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  So, you're on a totally +nother level.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I mean?  And I think it's hard for Americans to really adjust to that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so that -- that's kinda like the big thing.  They think that they're here and they're telling us what's going on and reporting to us the truth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and it's hard to get outta that because Americans wanna know so much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have so much of a need for information.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how accepting will we be if they told us nothing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But yet they don't want us spilling the beans, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's almost like a catch twenty two.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then you talk about fear.  Then we -- I think we'd have real fear.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because we're so used to getting so much information about anything we want.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, and sometimes I think that that -- that information can be, you know, a little bit biased in [NOISE] itself just --
R:  Oh, true.  True.
L:  But they -- what they choose to report on it and stuff.  And it can actually cause ... panic, you know, if there were something misinformed [NOISE] and things like that about terrorist attacks or, you know, any kind of +nuclear or, um, [NOISE] you know, um, [NOISE] uh, I'm trying to think of like poisons or something like that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know?  I mean, if that was misinformed, it would be -- it would create people to panic and, you know, everybody's going out now and buying gas masks ... you know?  Um ... so ... anyway, I -- I think that that can -- I think that -- that sometimes media can really handle that and -- and feed into people's fears and panic.
R:  I think they almost do that automatically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, uh, without them doing that, how can they have news?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, even you know -- you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because that's their whole business.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I mean?  I've got the news.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even -- even you notice the tones of voice totally change, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, um so ... I -- I don't know.  Me personally, I kind of expect that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Because it's more than just reporting what they have to us.  You know, that's their job and almost totally their whole life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... I think it comes across a little differently.  They've got a lot going on than just us observing what they're doing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I kinda expect that even --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- though I do understand what you're saying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  But you'll notice a totally different tone, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, a- a- and the wording is -- is -- is totally different.  Much stronger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A- and you don't need that.  You can just report whatever's happening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But this is their hype time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so they feel good about the fact that they've got this story.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it does -- it -- it can definitely cause alarm; there's no doubt about that.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.  Yep.  Huh.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think people are afraid, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.
R:  Um ... but I think now that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we've had so much drama.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  I think it's not as bad as it would've been.
L:  No, no.  And it's amazing to me how easily you forget about these attacks.
R:  Oh definitely.
L:  And really just go on ... with your own life and [SIGH] -- and you know, this recent war and things like that and, um ... [LIPSMACK] it -- it's just amazing 'cause my first initial reaction was, "Oh, my gosh, you know, in a way start hoarding things".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  [LAUGH] You got any more beans, right.
L:  Uh, I don't think -- Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think in a way I -- I -- like I -- like you said, I don't think I would be that way ... if I didn't have the two girls.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that puts a whole new twist on -- on terrorism and your outlook on stuff and I'm not supposed to be concerned of -- with those things as a Christian --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, still your natural instinct is to just kind of [SIGH] ... just -- to just really make sure that your -- your family and your kids especially are taken care of, and you know, that you can do [SIGH] anything that you can.
R:  You know, I just found myself saying, "Oh, well, here we go again".
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, because it's so over before it's begun.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean --
