L:  H- --
R:  Hi, my name is Karen.
L:  Hi, Karen.  I'm Helen.  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Interesting topic.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Uh. [SIGH]
R:  I think [SIGH] the last time I saw a high profile --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I don't know if it was a trial though.  I've just seen congressional hearings. 
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, I -- I think so.  It should be televised.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely should be televised because they affect all of us.  I don't know ... if high profile versus just anyone's trial.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, I don't think there should be a difference but obviously the interest is there for the high profile ... [inaudible] --
R:  Right, I mean, who determines what's high profile though?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is this something that the networks work out because they think they'll get a certain rating or is -- y- you know, it's, uh ... like, when they broadcast sessions of congress, that's because it's -- obviously we pay for it and there are certain channels that run it all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  But I mean, who gets to decide what's high profile?  I mean, personally when, uh, the Simpson trial --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- was going on, I could have done with less hours of that myself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, twenty four hour --
R:  You know --
L:  -- coverage and then --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- turn on CNN and Larry King's interviewing every person.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Yeah.  No.  No, in fact that, uh ... part of the -- the negative [LAUGH] side effects of, uh, televising high -- supposedly high profile cases are ... the fact that -- um, I mean, is the fact of the, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, the people involved in the trial become minor celebrities who get their fifteen minutes of time and I don't think that's a positive.
R:  Right.  Another thing that might be a problem is the trouble with some of these trials is, [LIPSMACK] there's usual- -- there may be an appeal, let's say and then contaminates the jury pool I think if everybody's watching it on television, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Because usually when they interview for jury they wanna know have you -- have you been watching this?  Have you any interest?  Do you know anything about this?  They prefer to have a blank slate jury which --
L:  Is impossible.
R:  -- is almost impossible nowadays but certainly if they're doing it wall to wall --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's going to be -- how -- how could you find anybody that doesn't know about it?
L:  Not unless you left the country.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, it's true.
R:  I'll go to Burmuda!  Send me! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Really.
R:  I'll be out of the, uh, country for you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh ... uh --
L:  No, you're right.  You're right.  You're -- I just, uh -- I can't even believe they have Court TV.
R:  Th- yes, that amazes me no end.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wouldn't want my, uh, small claims court stuff on [LAUGH] TV.
L:  Oh, no.  I think anything -- actually I think it's all very personal and I think that ... uh, even though I'm sure I -- I really don't know all the details on the O.J. Simpson case --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but from what I picked up on from the mass media blitz --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that I think the verdict would have been different.
R:  It may have been.
L:  You know?
R:  It may have been.  Certainly if for no other reason that the attorneys were playing to the television.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you know what I'm saying?
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, it reduced it to a sort of lowest common denominator ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, trial as far as what kinds of things were presented and how they were presented and the jury, you know, they have to deal with what they're shown, not what, uh, maybe someone else knows.  And if they're only shown certain things on a really crude level, how are they going to make a -- the best informed decision?  You can't go into detail or long explanations if they're playing toward the t- uh, television audience.
L:  Exactly.  I remember when, uh, I don't know if you're familiar with the case, Ronnie Zimora[?]?
R:  It rings a bell.
L:  He was a thirteen year old boy who killed, uh, I thi- -- I think it was an old lady.  Um ... and his defense was that he had watched that show that Telly Savalas was on.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And that had motivated him to do ... what he had done.  And ... to me and, uh, they decided, uh -- the fact is they decided that that case needed to be televised.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- yeah, what -- what was the point of that?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, th- -- I think that was one of the first if not the first televised ...
R:  Uh.
L:  -- case and it was ... you know, it was a unique defense --
R:  Right.
L:  -- based on TV being shown on TV.
R:  Right, right.  That's very, uh, meta something or other.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's steep ... I -- I- th- -- my concern about -- I -- I think certain things should be televised, especially if they involve the government.
L:  Uh!
R:  But -- but these other sorts of th- trials it -- it -- I -- I have my concerns about it.  Uh --
L:  International Enquirer.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] right.
L:  You know, it's the lowest common denominator.  We're already at the point -- it used to be, even though they weren't attractive, you could trust that the gentleman --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on the six o'clock news.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And now you have newsreaders --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that if their teleprompter stopped, they would be --
R:  Caught.
L:  -- stuck in -- in, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the ether --
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] with nothing to say and you end up, you know, with pretty much a -- a nice flow from, I guess, Entertainment Tonight or whatever it is --
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  -- before the news, to the news.
R:  Right, uh --
L:  Uh, I- it's the same thing.  There's no difference.
R:  Right, right.  There -- I -- I've -- I feel that there really isn't any news now.  It's entertainment ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of one kind of another and ... that wouldn't bother me so much if everybody would just acknowledge that but I don't think -- but there are -- I still think most people are making a distinction that no longer exists when they turn on the television and, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it -- it's the same ... uh, I remember seeing an interview with some -- some people that were child stars.
R:  Right.
L:  And they were all talking actually about -- most of them had criminal problems.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, had legal problems.  And they said that part of the issue was that people felt that they knew them.
R:  Ah! 
L:  Because they were in their home.  It's different if you're a child star ... in the movies.
R:  Uh, uh.
L:  That -- that's a step apart.
R:  Right, plus it's a one shot deal.  You just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- go see the movie or ...
L:  Right, but you're seeing this person on TV and, uh, the young people that are watching, the other young people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- think it would be just wonderful to get to know them and a great way to get to know them is turn them on to drugs, blah, blah, blah --
R:  Ah! 
L:  -- you know?
R:  Ah, ah.
L:  So, they said that's where a lot of that came from.
R:  Right.
L:  So it's the familiarity factor.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Which we don't really need to be that familiar with the criminal court system.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you would hope not.
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, maybe --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- it's a deterrent once in a while but considering there's not much difference between what's going on in the evening dramas.
R:  Right.
L:  And what's going on in the real worlds.  In fact now f- or was it the other night, they had something that they were promoing with, uh ... was it Law and Order?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was basically mimicking the Michael Jackson situation.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  Where instead of the star drop- --
R:  Right.
L:  -- holding the baby out the window, the star dropped the baby.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God!
L:  [LAUGH] So, that was a two hour --
R:  That's the improvement?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's like life imitating art imitating life and I'm like, what? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  And this was necessary the first time?
R:  Y- well, yes.  [LAUGH] Not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] uh-huh, oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's ... it's an interesting topic actually. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, surprisingly.
R:  I --
L:  Yeah, is this your first call?
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's -- congratulations.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm glad I got a good partner.
L:  Uh, th- -- yeah, this is interesting for me too.  It's just, uh ... I- [SIGH] -- when I first signed up for this I thought, "Oh, my goodness.  Now, what am I getting myself into?"
R:  Right.
L:  "And how much are these people going to know about me?"  But, uh, what the heck?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, actually, this caught my eye 'cause I was -- I -- I was gonna say I was brought up in the department.  My degree is from the department; the linguistics department at Penn.
L:  Oh.
R:  Right, so, I mean, I -- I admit the first thing I saw was ... being paid for an interview.  Oh, okay!  But then I -- then I said, "Well, what is this though?" and I started reading it and said, "Oh, my God!" you know?  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think it's very interesting but as I said to the fellow that took down your basic information, you know ... we were saying this should have been done twenty years ago or [LAUGH] twenty [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  It -- this thing about voice recognition because I'm sure you've had experience using them when you make phone calls.  They're -- they're not always what they ought to be.
L:  Oh, exactly.  Plus they use that --
R:  They're deaf, you know?
L:  -- voice recognition software in my computer.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's hilarious.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that -- that's amazing, you know, how much it can screw up and I'm sorry I'm not gonna sit there and read an entire book to a piece of software --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so it understands how I speak.  [LAUGH] It's a [inaudible]!
R:  Right.
L:  Unless they're bored yet.
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, and this --
R:  I mean, there's all kinds of -- I mean, commercial uses but also I know people who are disabled that would be really great if they didn't have to type, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  To use a computer.  I mean, they have -- as you say, they have these programs but they're deficient.
L:  [LAUGH] Slightly!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just amazing.  A- actually I -- I write and, uh, someone ... convinced me to write for one of the online easings[?].
R:  Ah!
L:  And I wrote an article --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- using voice recognition software --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- about voice recognition software and it was hilarious.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, it's -- first I -- I -- I, uh, posted the article as --  you know, as it was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, before an edit --
R:  Really.
L:  -- and then afterwards which -- it was less Mickey Mouse.
R:  Uh.
L:  It was -- it was just unbelievable what it didn't pick up ...
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and even the commands, uh, it, uh -- you would think ... that the commands --
