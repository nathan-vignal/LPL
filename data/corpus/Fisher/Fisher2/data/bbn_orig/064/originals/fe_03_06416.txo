R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?  [LAUGH]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I was just having a hard time hearing you.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm on a cellphone, actually at the gas station pumping gas. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Where are you?
L:  I'm actually in Washington DC.  And you?
R:  I'm in w- -- Green Bay, Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.  So, do you think people would react act calmly in a terrorist attack?
L:  No, I don't. [LAUGH] Espe- --
R:  Neither do I [LAUGH].
L:  Especially being here in Washington DC, you know, we -- we feel like, [SIGH] you know, we're a target for so many things.  And even when the -- the terror level goes up or down a notch, you can see the changes in people's reactions, the way they act, the way they drive, the way they shop.
R:  Wow!
L:  You know, they start shopping for catastrophes and things like that so, I think that it's almost ensures panic.
R:  Wow!  Yeah, things don't get quite as wild here.  I don't think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're as much of a target really.
L:  Yeah, and I don't even know if we really are but the perception that we are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is enough to make people panic.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could see that.
L:  You know, I mean, we have so many military installations, so many government facilities, um, and it's just -- you never know.
R:  Yeah.  There, I would be afraid.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  A little bit more that here.
L:  I actually work two blocks from the capital and so when nine eleven, I mean, at first no one knew what was going on.  And then when you finally did, you sort of freaked out because you were, like, oh, my God, is it coming here next, you know, kind of thing?
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  That would be very scary.
L:  It -- it was.  And then, you know, so, since then I think that the general sense is pretty much of fear, um, I think that most people have kinda put it to the back burner so that they can get through their daily business, but it is definitely apparent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How's the mood in general there?
R:  Um, right now it's -- it -- really it doesn't even come up very often.
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  It -- I mean, we kinda watch the news and they say it goes up, and it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- goes down but we a- -- there's no noticeable difference in how people act.
L:  Really?  Interesting!
R:  On nine eleven it was -- I mean, everyone across the whole nation was shocked --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and scared --
L:  Oh, God yes!
R:  -- and, I mean, you never knew around that time who was going to be the next target but --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- I think we feel for t- -- for the most people feel pretty safe here compared to a bigger city.
L:  Right, right, right.  And I just -- I think nine eleven just came so out of left field.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean, it was just an innocuous look Wednesday morning [LAUGH] and no one was thinking like that -- or Tuesday.  You know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and it just -- it just caught us like a gut punch almost, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.
L:  Now here, we have, um, we have actually things on our, um, interstates.  Do you guys have anything?
R:  There are any what?  Airspace?
L:  We ha- -- no we have, um, on our interstates we have, like, sign boards, the normal kind that would tell you, like, you know, how the traffic is and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  But instead of them doing that now, they broadcast the terror level --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and they -- they give an FBI eight hundred number for suspicious people --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and [LAUGH] very --
R:  Yeah, that's a little different.
L:  Yeah.  And they report anything, like, abnormal like --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- if there are you know, just any -- any new developments or they would give us, like, updates on the war, stuff like that.
R:  And that's right now?  Do you still have those?
L:  Yeah.  They were me- -- they're no- -- [MN] they're not updating the war any more or anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bu they still do have, um, the current terror level and the -- the FBI number for, uh, suspicious activity.
R:  Wow, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't have anything like [LAUGH] that here.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Not yet anyway.  Let's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hope it stays that way.
L:  I was going to say let's hope it doesn't to that, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I'm hoping that, you know, we're all, I mean, I don't -- I think that something wil happen unfortunately.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, you know, to what degree or what scope or anything, but I do feel like something else is going to happen, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Um, well, I'm hoping it -- I mean, if it does happen -- if it has to happen, I'm hoping it happens in a different county.  At an embassy versus --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in our back yard [LAUGH] again.  That --
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  -- was pretty scary knowing they could be there.
L:  Y- yes it was.  That was very, very scary.  The scariest even, you know, a- --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- and but now, you know, you hope that you figure [PAUSE] whatever happens, you know, I don't think you can get prepared though.  I think because --
R:  No.
L:  -- I don't think it'll be anything like the first one.
R:  No.  No it'll be something -- a whole new thing.
L:  Exactly.  Something we least expect, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it'll catch us completely off guard again.
R:  Yes.  Oh, definitely.
L:  Yeah. I don't know.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Do you have family in other places?
R:  Um, mostly around in Wisconsin so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  For the most part in all huge cities.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Have you guys talked about what to do if anything happens?
R:  Um, around nine eleven I [MN] mentioned it a little bit within the family but it really wasn't -- we were more afraid for the people who would be in -- in, like, Chicago or New York or --
L:  Mhm.  Okay, okay.
R:  -- or DC where you are.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] [inaudible] [LAUGH] right.
R:  [LAUGH] But really, I mean, there's nothing -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people are taping up their windows or whatever -- you hear of these people, um, duct taping everything up but that's not going to s- do much if --
L:  No.  Really it won't.
R:  -- some biological --
L:  No. Really it won't.  It won't unfortunately.
R:  No.  It -- you're pretty much gone for if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if that's released [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, if it happens and we're exposed, it's over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And part of this --
R:  Hopefully it'll happen quick.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, I hope so too.  Part of the thing here is that, you know, once you're pretty much, um, I think the thing that they were saying was that they had this whole plan here that if anything happens, basically, you know, there's -- there's DC in the middle but then there's Maryland and Virginia suburbs on both sides so, what they've been telling the public is that if anything happens there -- they've drawn this imaginary line through DC and say that, you know, anyone north of this line, um, you know, stay north of it.  If you live south of it you can't try to go home because, um, they think it'll be too much gridlock and that we'll be, you know, landlocked basically.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [inaudible]
L:  So, they're, like, setting shelters and have provisions and that, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if anything happens -- if you're south of the line --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stay there; if you're north of the line --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stay there and just have some kinda, like, person in another place who everyone in the family will contact to --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- you know, confirm if things are okay and --
R:  That's a good idea.  Yeah I -- 
L:  But yeah --
R:  -- they don't go into that [LAUGH] much detail here that I know of.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  It's not quite as an emergency -- much of a concern I guess.
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.
R:  Not at this point.
L:  And I guess it's sorta -- I'm so- -- I even wonder if -- if our paranoia --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is not, you know, sorta, you know, ill advised in a sense that I think that they -- since they hit DC and New York I'm thinking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that they might, you know, try to strike somewhere less --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- suspicious.  You know what I mean?
R:  That -- yeah, that is possible.  Yeah, um --
L:  You know.
R:  -- but I would have no clue as to where that would be. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know -- I don't know what they would think either because again, you know, to get in their minds, we're so not them so, it's -- it's hard to know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, what -- how they would think or, you know, what -- what direction it would come from.
R:  Well, I do think that it's not going to do much good to sit and worry about it day after day.
L:  No, I don't think you can --
R:  The quality of our life is going is going to just [LAUGH] go down the toilet if we're --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I mean, we got to enjoy life and try to be cautious but you can't sit in fear and --
L:  Right.  And that's part of the whole thing.  Like, even if they don't strike again, if they keep us in fear they've gotten us.
R:  Yes.  Yes they have.
L:  You know.  And that's -- that -- that s one of the big things.  It's like, you know, if you're afraid to go about your daily business as before, then they've won; they've succeeded.
R:  Yes, they have.  And it's bad enough they got as many deaths as they did.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.  I think so too.
R:  The whole nation shut down on nine eleven.
L:  Absolutely.  Even for the whole week I think we all kinda sat, like, in sun- stunned silence.
R:  Yes, we did.
L:  You know, like, oh, my God, what's happened?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, exac- -- I know I was sent home from work that day, on nine eleven. 
L:  Yeah.  We were too [LAUGH].
R:  Were you -- well, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Everything was totally really wild over there.
L:  Oh, my God.  And then, I mean, I literally -- I was, like, in from of the TV and it was making me ill but I couldn't not watch it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, exac- -- 
L:  Like, it was just -- 
R:  It's like watching a car wreck when you're driving by it.
L:  Yes, It was all consuming.
R:  [MN]
L:  And I -- I could not -- I could not take my eyes off it.  I -- I, you know, each story, each survivor -- for, like, that whole week I just -- it was almost like a bad rerun.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just kept watching and kept seeing it and couldn't make myself not.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. I -- 
L:  We were actually --
R:  -- I mean, I didn't even know anyone there   I can just imagine if I knew someone who was in New York or knew someone who was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- worked at the Pentagon.
L:  Right.   Well, thank God I -- I, you know, at least I didn't have any family that was, you know, hurt or anything.  But I know a lot of people in the Pentagon who worked really close to that area, you know, and, like, for, you know, those couple of hours, wondering if they're okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and where they are and how to get in touch with them, and that kind of stuff.  It was, you know, it was really a- a- -- it -- it was the type of, you know, unexpected emotional tragedy that you don't ex- -- you know, just, you don't know how to cope with.
R:  Exactly. Out of nowhere and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we've never had anything like that before.  We never -- our county has for the most part, been secure.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R: -- we felt so safe.
L:  Right.  Right.  Exac- --
R:  No one was going to touch us.
L:  Right.  The last thing that's happened -- what, Pearl Harbor.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and in -- and in, you know, comparison I think that at least at that time, we were at war [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  At least we [MN] had some sort of clue it was coming or --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- something was happening.
L:  Exactly.
R:  This was out of left field -- totally.
L:  Total left field. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  W- were you, um, did you got -- did you hear on the radio what had happened?
R:  Yeah.  Actually I was listening to --
