L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Fine, and you?
R:  Good, good.  My name is Gail and I'm from New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  My name is Danielle.  I'm from St. Lois.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, the topic I think was about the criminal trials.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Right, what do you think about it?
R:  Uh [SIGH], I don't know.  When I heard that topic I was like, ooh, I don't know if I s- should accept it --
L:  Right!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause I don't know what I could really say about it for ten minutes.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, my first instinct was, okay, uh, it sounds like a good thing.  I think everybody should have the opportunity to see the trials -- [MN] you know, to see the trial, but then after I thought about it for a couple of minutes, uh, I really don't think it's necessary to televise it.  I think it's, um ... I don't know, I --
L:  Yeah, because it gets too -- too publicized and too Hollywood.
R:  Yeah, and it may actually, um, even though I guess for most of the trials that the +jurors would be, you know, kept apart from everybody --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- else, I think it could have, um, an impact --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on, cause really, I'm sure those people actually must talk to some people on the outside even if they get sequestered it's -- so I really think that it might have some impact on the trial itself.
L:  Right.  Or even on the jurors' safety in the long run.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I never thought about that.  That's an important issue.
L:  It is because think about some of these crazy fans and stuff that are out there. 
R:  Right and they would be able to see it on TV --
L:  Right and --
R:  --who the jurors were --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they might have a really strong belief which way the trial should go --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and they could --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it may not be in their best -- you know, it maybe safe during the trial but after the trial's over ... [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, exactly.  You know, people don't think about some of those things and then if -- if for something that has a lot of grief in it, it's putting the family on display throughout the trial.  You know --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, even the family that might wanna actually see it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, it's just too emo- -- I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- unless they would do it differently that they would allow certain people to see it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but not be --
L:  Right, or -- or --
R:  -- you know, telecasted to everyone.
L:  Right, or maybe the trial be actually televised but the rest can't.  You know what I mean?  Some [inaudible] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the way that the courtroom could be set up for, you know, the televised things or something.  The way they have this much modern technology and different things, there should be a way that if it was to be brought to the public it could be brought to the public in a more tactful way.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um ...
R:  But to actually see a whole -- whole trial on TV I don't -- I don't know.
L:  But Court TV, I'm telling you, if you sit up and look at that, I mean, that shows all kinds of trials and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's -- it's iron- -- it's live because there -- there's almost no privacy now at all in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, no -- no censorship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to what all actually makes it on the television screens now and ...
R:  Now, are all trials that aren't telecast -- are they -- are any of them recorded though?  Besides like the -- you know, of course, there's the re- court reporter that's doing the -- but is -- I don't know, are they actually taped?
L:  Um, I would assume so.  You know, if -- if -- if nothing but the television station, you know what I mean?  Somewhere, somehow, somebody is --
R:  Yeah, I don't know if they do.  I don't -- I mean, I was on a -- I was a juror twice.  
L:  Really?
R:  I was just asking 'cause I just, you know, just last week there was a judge, I don't know if you heard about it, that was really brought up on charges because he asked one of the jurors -- no, no.  
L:  No, I didn't hear.
R:  One of the persons that was not a juror asked one of the defendant or the -- I don't know who, "Are you a terrorist?" 
L:  Really?
R:  And kept, you know, saying all these different comments and supposedly he was just, like, joking or something but she, like, fainted in the courtroom --
L:  Really?
R:  -- she was so upset.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah --
L:  No, I didn't hear about that.
R:  -- and now he's being asked to, um -- he's being asked to resi- -- you know, to --
L:  Really?
R:  -- to resign.
L:  Well, I know -- uh, I don't know.  Mm, there was something [inaudible] --
R:  So, I don't know if they can actually go back or just wonder if they can go out -- go -- you know, then they claim that he said something else and he's denying it, so I mean, I don't know.  I mean, if they have a tape, I mean, they're gonna be able to play it back and say for sure exactly what, you know, what transpired.
L:  Well, you know, the court reporter is documenting supposedly word for word everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that is going on.  So, I don't know who it's for --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- actually, but I'm assuming if it is on television then it is being taped.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know, so I guess that would be the -- one --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of the pluses of that is --
R:  Yeah, I remember back with O.J. Simpson that it wasn't on TV but the live verdict was.
L:  Right, right.  They only had, I think, distant pieces of the trial actually televised.
R:  Right.  That's right, that's right, it was.
L:  Right.
R:  Actually quite a bit of it was 'cause I remember my sister was so, like, obsessed with it that she was always watching.  I forgot about that.  
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And now what makes that one big?  Just because of who he is?
L:  Exactly.  You -- but that's the thing.  Who you are carries a lot of weight because had he been just a regular person off the street --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then it would not have gotten the publicity that it got.  He would not have had such leniency in some of the dealings that he had.  You know, it -- it -- it's sad because you can look at the O.J. Simpson, Rodney King, all of that, if it were not for the fact that a lot of those trials were on television, the publicity and -- and the -- the media attention that they got they would not have gotten to the extend that they got.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  So, what -- was there a two part question?  I can't remember, or was it just one?
L:  Yeah, um, h- have you looked at a trial --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on the TV.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, but -- or even like the Robert Blake trial or, you know, like, the one, um ... [LIPSMACK] I think they were advertising where the rabbi killed his wife.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, that -- that's -- it's in a way ... I guess it's kinda hard because there are so many pluses and negatives that you got -- I guess you gotta weigh out which --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is which because it just -- it gives you insight into what's really going on in the world.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, 'cause some of these people are really doing some crazy things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, if it was just purely to educate people then maybe it could just be seen, like, many years past.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know, people will realize what's going on in, you know, different things and outcomes but I think you had a good point about the safety of the jurors.  I don't know if it's ... televised, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when it's actually happening, I think it could be negative.
L:  Yeah, really.  I mean, because think about it.  The people put their side on people for testifying and different things, you know ... w- what do you think they do f- to the actual juror who convicts that person?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's -- there's -- when you look at, like, the mob or a mafia type when different things like that, there -- there -- there're some serious issues.
R:  Sure.
L:  [LIPSMACK] You know, and you never know who -- especially celebrities.  You never know what type of connections they have or -- or the fans themselves.  I'm telling you, you hear about, um, you know, climbing and sneaking into their homes and scaling walls just to see 'em and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just all of those -- everything.  That's -- they take that seriously.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know. 
R:  Have you ever been on a jury?
L:  No, I --
R:  No.
L:  -- luckily I haven't.  I don't -- I haven't.  I've never been +asked to.
R:  Right.  Actually, it's, um ... it's very -- it's a good learning experience.  I kinda, like, liked it.  Most people say, "Oh, I gotta go to jury duty".  If I have to go to jury duty I'd much rather just get picked and be on a jury than just sit there all day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was actually very, uh, very interesting the whole process.
L:  Really?  And I'm sure it would be, you know, because you get to really see how the whole judicial system operates.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, from the inside without, you know, [LAUGH] having it actually have to deal with you.
R:  Right, right, since you could be on it, yeah.
L:  Right.  It's like being on the outside --
R:  Right.
L:  -- looking in inside.  So, yeah, I'm sure that would be cool but no, I've never had that experience.  My mom, um, did a lot of work inside the court system so I would sit in on different trials and, you know, watch it or what have you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's the extent of it.  But then that was at -- during the time when, no, there were no cameras allowed inside of the courts or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like that.  You know, but there's -- there's this modern technology age though.  Everything -- when you get to televising a war, [LAUGH] you know, then you know courts, they have no --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH]
R:  I know, that it --
L:  -- you know, no chance at all.  So --
