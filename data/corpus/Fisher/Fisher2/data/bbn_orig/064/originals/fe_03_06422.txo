R:  Oh, hi.  My name's Ben.
L:  Hi.  My name is Jenny.
R:  Um, personally I believe that [LIPSMACK], um, uh, U.S., um, terrorism -- well, the -- like, when U.S. is under attack -- terrorism or not, uh, installs fear upon its citizens because, um, the U.S. is quite good at handling the situation, for example, the nine eleven situation has shown that, um, even though the World Trade Center has been bombed [NOISE] that, uh, as a whole there was not a general riot of great -- like racism, or like terror against, um, foreigners or people of different color.  Um, basically the nation simply remained calm and, uh, everyone waited until the government to, um, implement their decision --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um [SIGH] -- oh, shoot!  Uh ...
L:  I -- I agree with you on that.  I think that it was handled -- a lotta people thought about -- before they, you know, had their accident.  They were reacting, but in a good way and I think that right now there's more preparedness --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I think that everyone would keep their heads pretty calm and do the right thing.  I -- I think ...
R:  Yeah.  I think, uh -- plus I think the government is also doing, uh, a great job, like the media's also doing a great job at educating a -- a great mass, for example, um, recently there's like television shows that portray like such a possibility, for example, like one of the series, like, uh, television shows called twenty four --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- like such --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- incident -- yeah, 'cause they shot the season finale and they're like -- even though like, uh -- 'cause I saw in the movie they -- they give the possibility of U.S. soil being actually nuked and that -- that even though ter- uh, even though some parts of the nation wasn't hit the government was able to quickly, uh, strike down the, uh -- like some of the, um -- like citizens weren't there and chose -- chose to use brutality to deal with that situation --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and -- and it simply gives more confidence, uh people -- confidence about the ability of the government to handle such a situation.
L:  But do you think -- do you think that T.V. shows, um, create any fear though?  Or do you think that they show people that it would be handled well?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think that, uh -- I think that T.V. creates, um -- well, it -- it handles -- it tells people to handle really well because, um, like one of the function of the news media is for people to -- like when a situation happens like they meet -- they make people like, um, someone is in control and that's exactly what our media is doing.  Every time there's a situation that happens --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- our media is always like the first to be there.
L:  Right.
R:  They always give people the first like, uh, um -- like live -- or like the first, uh, hand news --
L:  Do you think ...?
R:  -- to actually what is -- exactly what's going on.
L:  Do you think that sometimes they show too much though?
R:  Um, not really because ...  Right now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, our current government is -- is, uh -- like, for example, our war against Iraq, basically our government has, um, brought up all this, uh, news footages --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as to like how U.S. has been bombing Iraq and like civilian casualties over there.  Basically the media has been, um [LIPSMACK], really pro the g- -- pro government.  So, not all the information are released.  They just feel like ...
L:  I feel sorry -- I feel sorry for the parents of the boys that are -- and girls that are over there though to see that when your child might be killed --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you wouldn't want to see that happening on T.V.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That kinda bothers me a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  Like, it -- I think the media is very different from, uh, back in the sixties where actually -- they actually show, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- real -- like uncensored footages where they're right now it's just selective.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- yeah.
L:  Like you're there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I re- -- I remember before like during the Vietnam War, um, they would show, um, like civilians -- like, even -- even though it's news that are b- bad, uh, for like U.S. image, but they would still show it.
L:  Yes.
R:  Like -- like civilians getting shot in the head.  But right now the entire T.V. -- like all the -- all the networks are pro war, they keep on, um, advertising for the operation like lib- free Iraqi, like some liberation thing.  So ...
L:  Yeah, which is good for all of our service people too --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- be getting that support.
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess this is [inaudible], but I definitely that, uh, um, people can like unite together and, uh, cast away the fear that they have right now --
L:  Isn't that great?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it -- 'cause like I think, um -- 'cause I know like for other, um, less organized country I would say --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like w- when such, uh, terrorism, like terrorism happened in their country, like they would first distrust the actions of their government, which would make a lot of things go really slow --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because, you know, how -- I -- I was learning this and they said like U.S. is a pretty strong state in the sense that, um, it can implement its decisions very fast and that ...
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  As soon as like ...
L:  It's a good government in control.
R:  Yeah.  So, I was thinking like if -- let's say, you liken this -- let's say U.N. China or like something like, uh -- like Asian country where -- as we can tell already like is not very organized --
L:  No.
R:  -- because from like -- from -- like, okay, their -- the way they deal with S.A.R.S. for example, like there's [inaudible] attack and the government cannot -- most of the, uh, Asian countries cannot quarantine the disease.  That shows like -- that shows the government's inability to handle the situation.  However ...
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  Yeah.  However, like, most of the time the U.S. -- every time -- like, we have -- the last time we had, uh, Anthrax.  However, the U.S. was quickly to, uh, control the situation and like --
L:  Yeah.  Like ...
R:  -- right now we don't ...  Huh?
L:  -- at the post office level where they shut down post offices and, you know, they focused --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on accents right away.
R:  Yeah.  So, like, let's say if government was like -- was really bad at dealing with Anthrax then the terrorist knows right away that U.S. cannot handle a bio warfare.  However, U.S. is able to like educate the people and then like -- you know, how if you go to a post office, they tell you what kinda mail you should be aware of?
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  And like the public e- educate everyone in -- in case ...
L:  Right.  I know -- I work -- I work at a hospital and they have so much in place right now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for any type of a bio terrorism.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's really great.  That --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it makes me feel safe knowing that we would be able to handle a lot right now if it did happen.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  That's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, then you -- you have no fear yourself then?
R:  Oh, no, I -- I definitely like -- I know -- I understand like this government has like pro or anti war, like both stands, but I definitely trust the decision of the government, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as to what this country should do and, uh, um -- because, I mean, after all, um, the decision as to what -- how U.S. should act is not -- be like the decision of only the President, but like -- we have a President, we have -- like, President from like before, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we have, um, a lot of like bureaucracy that could -- that are able to handle this kind of situation.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I'm pretty -- I'm pretty safe about like all of that.
L:  Even if there is a terrorist attack in your city you would be told what to do, it wouldn't be independent people deciding how to handle it and what to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean ...  Yeah.
L:  There's already a plan in place and you would just have to follow it and that's why I think there would not be a lot of panic.
R:  Yeah, 'cause like, um -- well, like through -- through the way that New York handled their situation during nine eleven --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, I think like each city can like model -- model towards their way because ...
L:  And what about all the people that went there to help from other states, you know?
R:  Well, I think it -- it shows like, uh, unity within this country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because like it -- it didn't really matter like -- like -- oh, like what city you're in, but it's just the idea of like U.S. has been bombed, it has, uh -- just like it consolidates everyone against --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- like terrorists, but ...
L:  'Cause you're American and you're one team.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it ...  Yes, and like, uh -- I'm not sure, but in like -- you know how, um -- like, through like some other like commercial up lift, like you know how if you watch like, uh, army commercial, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  They -- they keep on stressing like the army are one.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, that even -- even though if you're not joining the army you sort of get this [several inaudible words] like U.S. like as being as one and we should work as a team.
L:  That's a good point, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I think -- I think the government's like -- they're doing -- they're doing a pretty, uh, good job on like educating the, um -- the mass and stuff.
L:  Yeah, they really are.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  It makes me feel good really.  I mean, there's always good that comes outta bad and I think that's the best thing that came outta all of this.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Like, I think this event actually showed like, uh -- showed literally how like -- how good U.S. is at, um, either the decision making at least towards handling this kind of a crisis.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, 'cause then ...
L:  Do you think ...?
R:  Huh?  Excuse me.
L:  Do you think they'd be any panic though within your own family? 
R:  Definitely.  I think panic would occur, but there wouldn't be like a mass hysteria over -- like of -- with the safety of the nation, you know?
L:  No.
R:  But like definitely ...
L:  But like with children who are in school?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That I worry about.
R:  Yeah.  Like, I mean, to a certain extent yes, fear would occur, but it wouldn't be like the country would suddenly be overrun by chaos as seen in -- like, as possibly like other countries due to the weakness of their government.
L:  Right.
R:  I think ...  Yeah.
L:  Or that we would get vulnerable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  That wouldn't happen I don't think.
R:  Uh-huh.  Like ...
L:  Like there would be a vulnerable time.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause the U.S. is like -- U.S. has like the strongest military --
