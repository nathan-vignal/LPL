L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, who's this?
R:  This is Janet.
L:  Janet, hey, my name's Janice.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, hi, Janice.  How're you?
L:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
R:  I am in Florida.
L:  Oh, Florida?  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi, na- -- hey, howdy neighbor.  So ...
L:  Okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about criminal trials?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I love to watch criminal trials.
R:  I do too. [LAUGH]
L:  I watch Court TV a lot.
R:  Yeah, are you addicted to it?
L:  I am.  Uh, 'cause I work outta my home and so, uh, I have to have Court TV on sometimes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And right now in Atlanta, I'm watching this, um -- this thing they're having about, uh, the sheriff in Atlanta who allegedly plotted to kill someone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's what they're doing right now here.
R:  Wow.
L:  Why- what are they doing in Florida right now?  What's going on in Florida?
R:  Uh, actually I haven't -- [SIGH] lately I haven't w- been watching too much but, um, I'm -- I'm -- I'm waiting to see if you thing they're gonna have that Scott Peterson ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on, uh, TV?
L:  Court TV?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I hope they do.
R:  I do too.
L:  But, um ... what was the other question?  Do we watch criminal -- criminal trials?
R:  Right.
L:  Televised, and there was something else.
R:  Oh, Jeez, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Just about criminal trials?  
R:  Yeah --
L:  Okay, what else?
R:  -- um --
L:  Although sometimes I think it can be unfair to, um, a defendant.
R:  To publicize it, yeah.
L:  Because then you have the prosecutor and the press saying all these things that may or may not have happened.
R:  Right.
L:  And it prejudices the defense.
R:  That's true.  But you know, every -- e- e- ev- -- uh, it should be public knowledge what goes on though, you know?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they shouldn't have closed trials because ... well, it's just -- they shouldn't.  I don't -- I don't think they should.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think all trials should be ... uh, totally open.
L:  But what if you were a defendant though?  How would you feel?
R:  [NOISE] Well ... uh, if I was a defendant ... if I was innocent I would wanna be, you know, on -- I would want everyone to know.  
L:  Right.
R:  If I wasn't then I sh- -- you know, that's my problem.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  I shouldn't a done it in the first place.
L:  'Cause I know sometimes prosecutors they exaggerate and they out and out lie.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  Have you noticed that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, they'll say things like, uh, "Oh, it was a big sex cult" or something and then there'll be, like, no cult whatsoever.
R:  Hm.
L:  I mean, they just out and out lie to make things juicier.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I don't know.  [LIPSMACK] But I just will never get aw- away from it because of the internet and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- cable TV so we'll always have televised trials.  You can watch a trial on the internet now too.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where was that?  I haven't seen that.
L:  There's this thing called, um ... [SIGH] something jury.  What is it called?  I saw it.
R:  Something jury?  Mock jury?
L:  Something like that and you can watch and, uh ... like a mock jury thing yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then you can watch and you give your opinions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um ... I -- I -- I forgot what the name of it is but I've seen it before.
R:  That sounds cool. 
L:  Yeah --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- but it's -- it's hard because it's a real small little thing you're looking at.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um ... [LIPSMACK] what is the name of that company?
R:  I don't know.
L:  It's a company in Atlanta that does them.  I'm trying to think.  It's like, uh -- oh, I know what it's called.  It's called decision quest; that's what it's called.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Decision quest and they do jury consulting and stuff like that.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, and they -- they publicize a lot of mock trials --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to see if they're gonna be televised.
R:  Have you ever, uh, participated in one of those?
L:  Um, in a real trial?
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, I hav- -- I've been called a couple of times and I've been, um, struck from the jury.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Have you?
R:  No, never been called.  I don't know why.
L:  Are you are registered voter?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, you vote?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I think it was probably we're in military.  We move a lot so maybe that's why.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  I know I was somewhere -- I was like here for five years before I finally got called --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- for a trial and, uh, it was not televised.
R:  Was it a juicy one? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I'm trying to think what it was about.  I think it was about some fraud.  Um, a businessman had done some fraud.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's what it was about so it wasn't really that juicy.
R:  Oh, bummer.  
L:  But --
R:  I don't think I would wanna be on a juicy trial though 'cause you know, having somebody's life in the -- [SIGH] in your hands.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  I would -- I -- I -- I just wouldn't be able to deal with that I don't think.
L:  Mhm.  Well ... you know, they say t- televised trials within, um, CNN does all this, um ... televising of things too so I don't know how I feel about it.  I mean, I kinda wan- wanna hear about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I like watching lawyers 'cause I'm -- I'm a paralegal.
R:  Oh, you are?  
L:  I've done some paralegal work.  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.
L:   But then again I see how unfair it is to the defense.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause I kinda know it from both sides ... [LIPSMACK] you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So, what part of Florida do you live in?
R:  I am in Jacksonville.
L:  Jacksonville?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, they don't have a lot of trials there?
R:  Mm, nah.  I mean, they do.  They're just, uh, nothing really interesting.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's nothing really going on right now that I know of.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... I'm just ... usually I'm watching CNN to see what's going on, you know, basically.  I don't ... I don't know [SIGH] about Atlanta but here it's just, uh ... it's kinda boring, you know?  You get the paper and it's like nothing's really happening. [LAUGH]
L:  My God, there's a murder in Atlanta every day it seems?
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, they do -- they did have one, uh, I heard about today but I don't understand it.  I thought once you were tried for, like, murder and ... you couldn't be tried again.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ther- this guy here he -- he was tried for murdering his wife and I think the first time something happened.  I don't know if -- if ... they said, uh -- I only heard it briefly on the news but, uh, I think they said -- I don't know if they said it got kicked out or whatever and they tried him again and he was found guilty and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then it was ... overturned or something and then they tried him ag- -- this last time for the third time and he's --
L:  Yeah, well, wh- --
R:  [LAUGH] -- again.
L:  -- when a conviction is overturned, it goes back to square one.
R:  Really?  I thought wh- -- I thought that was like ...
L:  Double jeopardy?
R:  Yeah, I thought you could only be tried once.
L:  No.  See once it's been overturned that means you kinda wipe it away --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they can try you again.
R:  Really?
L:  You can only -- you're thinking of double jeopardy, only applies when they're found guilty.
R:  Uh therefo- you mean not guilty?  If they're found not guilty you can't be tried again?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Okay.  [SIGH] I didn't know that.  I was like, "Gosh, this poor -- this --"
L:  Yeah, if you're found not guilty.  But do you know what they do?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What they're doing with that Terry Nichols?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They tray- tried him in federal court and state court --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to avoid double jeopardy.
R:  Uh.
L:  Which is really sneaky.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Those prosecutors, I can't stand some of 'em sometimes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They just violate a lot of our civil rights --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and our constitutional rights.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and John Ashcroft is -- is violating our rights too.
R:  But then you turn around and the -- and you have all these defending lawyers who are ... making a mockery of the system.  And have people who are DUIs ten times.  Uh, they still get to -- they get off, they still ... you know, walking the streets.  You have murderers have go free.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, to me, that's a mockery ... of the system.  To have someone who's obviously guilty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just walk out because of something ... small.  Something trivial.
L:  Like who're you talking about specifically?
R:  Uh, we- for DUI they're -- they're -- there was something on the news here the other night.  They were catching people who have eight, nine, ten DUIs and they're still, you know, around.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I thought, you know, it was like once -- once or twice you get caught and [LAUGH] you're done.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  How can you have eight, you know?  You shouldn't even be walking free.  
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, just even like the -- the O.J. Simpson thing, anything.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Any -- any trial ... it seems like, uh, one little paper mishap and, uh, they get -- they get off.
L:  Yeah, but that's out constitution.
R:  Right.
L:  You need to -- i- i- if you study constitutional law you'll see that, that ... it, you know, applies to everybody.  It's unfortunate.
R:  Well, the -- I -- I see it as whoever's got the most expensive lawyer.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you have a public defender you're gonna fry and if you can afford a rich one you will get off one way or the other.  I pretty -- I -- that's basically the way I see it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  There's some good public defenders though.
R:  Yeah, but they don't have the resources as -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- as the more expensive ones.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So --
L:  Whereas the prosecutor has an unlimited bank account.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes, yeah.  I -- I would think so.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, what can you say?  I guess it's gonna be flawed no matter what.  [NOISE]
L:  So, you -- I take it you've never had any dealings with the criminal justice system?
R:  No, not really.
L:  Yeah, that's why you feel the way you do.  If you had some dealings with them like I had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then you would see the -- the dirtier side of it with the prosecutor side.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they make deals and stuff but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just see too many, um -- too many walk free too. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  Um, what [inaudible] say.  Oh, they -- I did hear of another one here, um, someone I -- uh, the GPS thing.  That -- that one's I'm wondering about.  How -- how can that be legal?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That --
L:  How -- yeah, I heard about that.  That global positioning thing?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and that's going before the, um, the Washington Supreme Court, isn't it?
R:  I don't but that -- that guy who murdered his wife, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we were talking about, the one in California.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's how they caught him.  [LAUGH] They -- they tracked him with his G.P.S.  Or that's why they got him -- they arrested him when they did because ... I -- or something.  That's what I heard.  Something about his G.P.S.
L:  So, you think we should have those or not?
R:  Well, I guess it's like phone wire tapping, you know?  If you have a court order I don't see why not.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, they -- they did get a man here.  He murdered his wife and he buried her in the forest up near the zoo here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and left.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And said that she went to Key West and so had been missing eve since and the cops said, "Yeah, right.  We don't believe you".  Well, they used his global positioning unit and the idiot went back to the scene of the crime.
