R:  Jason.
L:  Hi.  This -- this is Sue.
R:  Hi, Sue.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good, thanks. Are we starting now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I didn't know what it was about until just a minute ago. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, me either.
L:  Um, well, what do you think?
R:  Um, I -- actually I talked about this before.  I don't know if it's gonna count against me, but I did --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- talk about this before with someone else.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't know.  I'm -- I'm someone who just believes everybody should [LAUGH] anything they want.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that -- I think that the media craze has gotten a little excessive but, you know, it's hard to say -- it's hard to go back now and draw a line when it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been a sort of a free for all, ah, up to now. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, and I -- I think that it's -- that it's -- that we wanna know what's going on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because as a people we just do that, [LAUGH] you know.  I mean, how -- how long did you sit in front of MSN or whatever when the war was going on?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know.  And I think that -- that we wanna know what's going on.  And I don't think that they should get any special privileges --
R:  Right.   
L:  -- 'cause they --
R:  And some of it's --
L:  -- are [inaudible] --
R:  -- it's the only way that we even experience the judicial system.  We don't even understand it until we see it on TV, and then all of a sudden we -- we can make sense of it because there are things like Law and Order and, you know, LA Law --
L:  That are phoney.
R:  -- and Matlock.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And before those things came along people didn't know what happened in courtrooms.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Did you --  
L:  Some of 'em --
R:  -- watch --
L:  -- are kind of --
R:  -- OJ?
L:  I did.  And, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that -- that's the biggest one I think right there.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  And I think it's because the media, um, was on him when he tried to take off.  You know, what --
R:  Right.
L:  -- did they say it was?  The biggest pizza night of the year for --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- families 'cause they were glued to their television sets.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but I -- I mean, I'm a person who will sit and watch 'em.  Um, and some of 'em are kind of interesting, but some are kind of boring.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know what I mean?  And -- and to the point where -- when you lose interest.
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, um, and some are depressing I think too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, the mother and her --
R:  True.
L:  -- her children in Texas and -- and, ah, where are you from?
R:  I'm originally from Texas.  I live in New York now.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, I'm originally --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from Texas.
L:  I'm in --
R:  So --
L: -- Montana.
R:  Oh, really?   Where in --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- Montana?
L:  Dillings[?].
R:  Oh, really?   I -- my --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- family -- my dad and all of his family is from Missoula.
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  And I --
L:  -- nice up there.
R:  -- lived -- I lived in Missoula for about two months.  But, that's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- all I really know of Montana.
L:  Oh. 
R:  No -- no real high -- high profile crimes going on up there, are there?
L:  No, not generally.
R:  It's pretty quiet in Montana.
L:  [LAUGH] And I like it that way. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. That's good.
L:  Yeah, it's not generally.  And I guess that's maybe why, you know, we do watch, um, what we watch and -- and what happens, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on TV.  And I -- I think that a lot of people wouldn't, um, experience it, like you said, without --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the media, you know.  It's -- it's like anything else.  Like I said, the war.  You know, you're just glued to the TV, but then it comes to a point that you can't go on any --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- more.
R:  Right.  It's like, where do you -- where do you draw the line between watching the trial and then watching the execution on TV? [MN]
L:  Yeah.  What's -- I --
R:  And when, you know, if everybody decide to -- to televise Osama Bin Laden is he's found, or if Saddam Hussain is found to be alive -- if they ever find -- you know, what --
L:  That should --
R:  -- what are --
L:  -- be televised.
R:  -- they going to do?  And everyone's gonna want to see that, right?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, everyone in America anyway.
R:  Everyone that -- yeah, at least.
L:  I would hope -- I would hope.  Um, yeah, you live in New York City did you say?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.  Were you there during the --
R:  I was.  I -- I was at --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- school on Long Island, so I wasn't, you know, right in the city.  But, it was --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- a pretty scary day.
L:  Oh yeah.  It's awful -- awful.  And it should be televised, 'cause we wanna know what's going on with him.
R:  Right.
L:  I think -- I think what happens if the media doesn't get involved, then the government takes over and starts, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not telling us the whole story.
R:  Right.  That's true.  And then the thing about seeing a court, you know -- ah, on Court TV seeing it [several inaudible words], you're not getting it from the words of a reporter.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You're able to see it yourself and make your own judgements as opposed to taking the judgements that the media gives you, 'cause they are very quick to give you their opinions.
L:  Yes they are.  Right.
R:  You know[?], everything's pointed.
L:  But, that's okay, you [LAUGH] --
R:  But, no --
L:  -- know.
R:  -- it's good.
L:  It's like you said -- you know, like the Menendez brothers, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when -- killed their parents for money.  You --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- know, that was kind of -- it's gonna be interesting to see what happens with that guy down in California -- that Peterson -- Scott Peterson.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And otherwi- -- I mean, you know, because I am a news freak anyway and -- and gotta know what's going on in the world, um, I think that's the only way up here.  I mean, I -- I get the newspaper and stuff, but also --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the reports on, um, the Internet and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause, I mean, you could push it that far that you can get more current reports on TV and the Internet than out of your daily newspaper.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  You know?
R:  Um,
L:  So -- but, I --
R:  Also another thing that I was -- I just thought of is, ah, you know, I guess we -- we have the right to obtain information, but there's also victims rights, you know.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  If someone is being put on trial because they raped someone, and they're having to interview the -- the rape victim, and that person has to be on TV and explain themselves in front of all of us as well as in front of attorneys -- I don't know, you know. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems like --
L:  I think that --
R:  -- that would be difficult.
L:  I think that they do -- they do have to protect the victims.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I guess -- but, they do that already, don't they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I --
R:  But --
L:  -- mean?
R:  -- I -- I don't know.  [MN] Um, I had it on Court TV.  I switched it over.  But, they're playing some --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- movie.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And I was watching -- I don't -- I'm not even sure what it was, but some girl was giving a speech -- like, a young girl -- like, sixteen.
L:  [NOISE]
R:   She was giving a speech --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- about someone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- else -- another girl at her school who -- um, who was wearing some sort of defamatory -- something on her tee shirt about the United States, or about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, something about the war, and that it was affecting she and the rest of the people in the school.  And that the girl -- maybe she got expelled or something because she was suing the school district.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's interesting about, you know, people being able to, you know, have free speech and make their own political statements, but then taking it into a place like a public school where, you know, most kids are -- they have to be there.  They can't just choose to not look at her shirt -- I mean, her shirt flair.  And I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, then it comes back to freedom of speech, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- of course, I don't -- what the kids are wearing [NOISE] to school isn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right anyway. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ha.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. 
L:  So, [LAUGH] but, um, yeah I think that -- I think that the freedom of speech is -- is important.
R:  Right.
L:  But, out- --
R:  And I wonder -- I wonder what teaches those -- what -- what this court trial is teaching those kids in high school, you know.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Suing your school 'cause they kicked you out.
L:  As far as being televised?
R:  And it's on TV, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that your school is on TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's interesting.
L:  [MN] No.  And, okay, so then, like, the shooting down in -- um, in Littleton, Colorado.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, um -- 
R:  I actually -- I actually lived in Colorado during that timeframe too, so --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  I did.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  I went --I went to high school in the same [NOISE] county that, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Columbine is in.  I went to a school in Jefferson County.  I did speech and debate there at that high school, so --
L:  Oh, really?   
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  See, I -- I mean -- I think that people would've wanted to see what would happen to those kids if they would -- if they would've lived.
R:  Yeah. 
L:   They --
R:  No, they -- definitely.
L:  Because, you know, and -- and --
R:  If you want --
L:  -- was going --
R:  You want some so much to see remorse --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the people's eyes.
L:  I don't even think you want --
R:  And you wonder if they do --
L:  -- you wanna exp- -- the experience if you're raising kids.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, signs to look for in what's going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, that's -- I don't know.  My girlfriend was down there too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And was down there at the time.  So -- but, yeah, I don't know.  Got any --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- big weekend plans?
R:  Ah, nope.  I am -- I'm actually an actor, so I'm going off to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Philadelphia.  I have an audition tomorrow in Philadelphia.  And --
L:  Oh cool.
R:  -- my friend's coming to pick me up right now.  We're gonna go do that.  And -- and then I'll come back to the big city and keep looking for work.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Well --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's not a bad thing.
R:  Yeah, it's good.  How 'bout you?  What are you gonna do?
L:  Um, we are gonna go camping up in the mountains. [NOISE]  
R:  Oh good.  That's what my mom's gonna go do.  She lives in Denver still, so they're gonna go camping and do all that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fun stuff.
L:  Cool.
R:  You know, very --
L:  Well, that'll --
R:  -- cool.
L:  -- be -- that'll be -- yeah, we're gonna take off tomorrow.  Go golf and stuff.  So --
R:  Fun.
L:  Ha, yeah.  I think that it [NOISE] will be.  So, [NOISE] um, I'm [NOISE] actually in [NOISE] my car right now with [NOISE] my husband and my daughter. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's funny.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  What do they think? [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you know, he answered the phone.  I said, "What's it about?"  He goes, "I don't know. I couldn't understand that". [LAUGH]  But, it is --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L: -- about the media and big profile tr- --
