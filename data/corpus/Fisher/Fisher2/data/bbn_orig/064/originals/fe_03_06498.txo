L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name is Sandra.
L:  Hi, I'm Doranne.
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing pretty good, how're you doing?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  So, [LAUGH] have you ever watched a televised court trial?
R:  Uh, y- sometimes I do.  I watch Court TV.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  I was to- -- I watched the O.J. a little bit over the summer cause my mom was watching it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think everyone watched that one.
L:  [LAUGH] It was on forever.
R:  You couldn't help but watch it.  Yeah.
L:  I know.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] so do you think it's right?  Like, for them to televise it?
R:  No, um, maybe in hi- -- a highlight here or there but to televise the whole thing?  No.  U- --
L:  Yeah, I have to agree with you.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it gets kinda boring after a while for one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And all you really care about is the verdict anyway so --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  You don't wanna see it on sold everyday.
L:  Yeah, it gets old, um --
R:  Yeah, very.
L:  I don't know.  I just don't think it's right.  Like, you wouldn't watch every normal day, um, court case so why would you have to watch like OJ's court case?
R:  I know.
L:  It gets kinda tiresome.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh ... let's see, I'm new to this so I'm still sitting[?] here.
L:  Yeah, this is my second one and it's all right.  This morning it was like this topic's weird cause the first one I had was, um ... [LIPSMACK] hold on.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, sorry, um --
R:  Okay, that's okay.
L:  Um, the first one we talked about what hobbies you liked to do and there were like, oh, you need to talk for ten minutes.  They're actually -- that was like the longest ten minutes I've ever talked.
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know what else to say about Court TV.
R:  I don't either.  I mean --
L:  Oh, I know.  I hate those stupid court TV shows that come on every day --
R:  I do too.
L:  -- like [LAUGH] ... the --
R:  The judges, um --
L:  -- the Judge Mathis [LAUGH] show.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hate that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Terrible.  Like, I watch it and I'm like oh.  I don't know how these people stay on.
R:  I know and it's -- let's see, our lineup consists of maybe six court shows in a two hour span.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And yeah, it -- yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Terrible.  And they're like real personalities too.  Like they get -- like, they get all excited.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And like the people, um, telling their case and they're actually making fun of the people like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- trying to talk about themselves or whatever and like the judge that my grandmother watches is crap and, like, the judge is, like, ooh, you like to do this?  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm like it's really not that funny but all right.
R:  I know.  Yeah, I know someone and that's all they do the whole evening is watch Court TV.
L:  Terrible.  Ugh.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  [SIGH] Let's see.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How many minutes was that?  Two?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... ooh, I can't see.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Four minutes and thirty eight seconds.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I don't know if that counts for the time it took for them to connect us.  I -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I'm not sure. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  It's -- so how does this work -- I signed up for it online but I'm still not really familiar with it.
L:  Um, you get ten dol- -- oh hold on, you get ten dollars for every, um ... [LIPSMACK] call that you complete.  An extra ten dollars.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I mean, that's actually ten minutes and then supposedly like there's a referral program that if you get -- for every guy that you refer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who actually does this thing you get five dollars and then -- no, you get five dollars every guy that you refer and then every guy who actually goes through with it, you get ten dollars.  All depends.  It's like fifteen dollars --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- per guy that actually goes through with it, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, [inaudible] actually talk to my friends and get some of them to sign up cause I could really, you know, use that.
R:  Right, use the money, right.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

R:  Yeah, moved here about two years ago and I'm just hating it.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] And looking for a place to relocate to.
L:  Where are you originally from?
R:  Um, well, we've moved around but the last place I lived was Alabama.
L:  Oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how was Alabama?
R:  It was okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's a state.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]

L:  Yeah, I used to, um, [LIPSMACK] when I was in high school I took this health occupation course and my teachers used to [inaudible] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and one of 'em did, like, I guess, yeah, the -- the physical therapy kinda thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so yes, she was -- because the whole course was, like, if I'd taken the entire year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and would have become a certified nurses assistant.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I didn't wanna do the clinical rotation so I just took like the classroom section.  It was really interesting and --
R:  Yeah, it is interesting.
L:  -- I'm glad I took it, yeah.  I'm really glad I took it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was very good. [LAUGH]

R:  Uh, so what do you do?
L:  Um, I'm a freelance web designer.
R:  Okay, cool.
L:  Yeah, it's [LAUGH] ... it's pretty exciting.  No, it's not.  Um, it's a lot -- it's kind of frustrating sometimes when I first got into it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I set up my own website and it took me a week to do and I was like spending like twelve hours a day, like, working on it --
R:  Doing it.
L:  -- and I was so confused and I called my friends up and they were like, "You should have taken C.P.S."
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was like, well, you know, [LIPSMACK] but now, you know, it's paying off.  I do that and I do music so that's what keeps me busy all the time basically.
R:  Yeah.  What programs do you use or do you use any?
L:  Um, I do, like, use Front Page and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- sometimes I use Netscape Composer.  I really don't get into like [inaudible] and stuff like that.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  Um, I try -- I mean, it's -- it's not like I don't do like all the flash and the super animated websites but like for business, businesses just want like normal websites.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I do that.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, pretty decent.

R:  Uh, no, um ... well, I have a book with html coding and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Java and all that so I kinda --
L:  Right.
R:  -- play through the book and ... you know, put it on the site and see how it looks and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's old.  I'm still with the basics I hadn't learned but --
L:  Yeah, I mean, that's like all you really need.  Like ... I -- I'm finding out a lot of people like sit there and go and go the source codes for other websites and pull their stocks and use it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  It's been, like, I thought -- it's really top brand [inaudible] so you can't do that.  It's like, oh, shit.
R:  Right.
L:  But [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well, it's not too bad.  Um, I don't know it -- it pays the bills.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I do a four side job too for side money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't charge much --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- cause they really don't take long to do it so --
L:  Exactly.  It's --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- really quick like if you know what you're doing.  Like, once I got started it was like, you know, I could do page -- uh, like I'd probably in a week but I could do a page in like a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, [inaudible] through the door like hounding me [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [inaudible] and I remember saying a week -- a week'll be like oh, she's working hard.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The hardest problem I've had is getting a free host, um, where to park -- you know, to park it.  That's the hardest --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- problem I have ever had.  Yeah, um --
L:  Um ...
R:  I --
L:  Like they --
R:  -- well, what I do is I go through, um, go daddy dot com to register --
