L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] My name is Sharell[?].
L:  I'm sorry, what is it?
R:  Sharell.
L:  Sharell?  My name is Melanie.
R:  Hi, Melanie.  So, have you watched any high profile court cases?
L:  [NOISE] No.  You know, the only ones that come to mind are like, O.J. and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Immediately.
L:  The, uh -- who were the -- who were the two brothers out in California who killed their parents?
R:  Oh, yeah, the Menendez?
L:  Yeah, the Menendez.
R:  Yeah.  Well, and that Kennedy cousin.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That was big for a while, you know, when he was -- when he was on there so -- but I didn't really -- I mean, I guess I watched a little bit of O.J.  I think everybody did.  
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  I think you couldn't avoid it. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess all that I saw of it was what, you know, the clips that they pulled out and put onto the news.  I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I didn't really watch, you know --
R:  Yep.  
L:  -- the Court TV or whatever the channel is.
R:  No, I didn't.  At that time I don't think I even had Court TV so --
L:  Yeah, I'm sure I didn't.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so I just would see it -- you know, I mean, it was everywhere so it was hard not to see something of it but, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  So our -- we- our -- our, uh, objective is to decide whether that is appropriate or not?
R:  Yes, I guess whether it should be and I -- I think in some cases it should be.  Um, i- I think there's a lot of 'em, not necessarily celebrities like that but I think there's a lot of trials that are of ... great public interest.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I think sometimes the public really does have a right to know what's going on in the courtroom.
L:  Well, like the Lacey Peterson trial now.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  You know, that -- that has been so publicized --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in the media --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- up to this point that it would be kind of a shame for the public not to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have that opportunity to know where it goes from here.
R:  Yes, absolutely.
L:  And, you know, like with the O.J. trial, I wished I had seen more of that trial because when they came back with the verdict, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was puzzled.  It's like how could those people have made that decision?
R:  I know you -- you -- well, I g- -- I mean, having been on a jury, I guess you do get kind of -- you live in a glass bubble I guess but you just don't hear all the stuff that we're all reading in the newspaper and seeing and all that kind of thing but I still don't understand how they came back with that verdict.  I --
L:  Well, yeah.  You know, it's like you said, we -- we read the part that some reporter deems important enough to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- give us on TV or give us in the newspaper --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and we don't see and hear everything that the jury heard and saw and ... you know that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess that was one of those trials where the, uh -- the emotional aspect of it --
R:  Oh, I think so.  
L:  -- probably really played in.
R:  Well, of course, you know, they don't hear and see all the things that we do either because they're --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- they're not supposed to watch TV, you know, the news or read the papers or anything else and -- and that's where I've always gotten most of my information is from outside sources.
L:  Well, and then the other thing is what the judge allows and doesn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- allow and --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- you know, we know that, you know, this thing happened in the guys past but it's not allowable --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for whatever bizarre reason.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, you're right.  The jury gets a different, uh -- different take.  Uh, you know, and by televising 'em, then it's kind of a like us watching a soap opera or something.  We know more than just one side of it.
R:  Yeah, actually yeah because we would still know more than the jury -- 
L:  Mhm, because we got --
R:  -- uh, in most cases.
L:  -- their side as well as the outside.
R:  Mhm, 'cause we would have -- would have read the newspapers and seen the comments and the ... m- uh, you know, everybody had something to say about all these trials [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Mhm and, you know, I don't think the cameras on the courtroom really influence -- you know, I've heard, like, in the O.J. trial that they were playing up to the cameras but you know --
R:  I don't think it does them any good.
L:  -- I think after a certain point they become immune --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to the cameras being there.  I don't think that they -- they think about 'em after the first couple of days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or even the first day.
R:  Well, and they were very careful.  I know the few times that I caught sight of it they were very careful not to show the jurors --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ow- -- you know, they did not show their faces at all or anything near the jury box so y- you know those people -- their privacy was protected and, you know, he had no privacy because he was a -- it is called a public trial for a reason --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] so, I mean --
L:  And there's only so many seats available and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, trials like that, there are people even closer obviously to the situation than you and I are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that wanna know what's going on.
R:  Oh, ab- -- well, and I think when and if the trial comes up for, like for instance the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in Utah, you know, I think people are gonna be very interested if there's any answers that come out of that.  What in the world were those people thinking.  What -- 
L:  Oh, if one --
R:  -- you know, why did they do that and --
L:  Well, what really went on, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  Did she go voluntarily or --
R:  What really did happen, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, how did they keep her that long without her telling somebody or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- trying to escape or something and I think a lot of people are gonna be interested in that.  
L:  You're right and --
R:  And there's several cases like that.  Like that little girl that got murdered, um ... [SIGH]
L:  The Van Dam case?  Is that the one you're thinking of --
R:  Yeah, I think that's -- yeah, yeah.
L:  That one's already come and gone but you're right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and it -- it -- it -- at least when they televise 'em, I guess it gives the rest of us some closure --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- as to -- instead of going, you know, whatever happened with that?
R:  I know.
L:  Because so often you get the -- you get the beginning and you get the disaster --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you don't really hear what the ending of it was.
R:  Mhm.  Well, and that's the thing about Lacey Peterson.  Everybody's so into that, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if it just kind of dribbles away and nothing ever happens then, you know, people are gonna wonder.  I mean, every once in a while it's gonna pass your mind and say, "Well, what ever did happen with that?" you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did he get charged or did he ... you know, get off of that or whatever happened so --
L:  Yeah, and if he got off, what -- what defense did he use?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] what in the world did he find that he could get off?  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But I -- I don't know.  I think part of it's morbid curiosity of course and --
L:  Oh, yeah, well, reality TV is the thing now.
R:  Uh, absolutely.
L:  You don't get much more real than that!
R:  And boy that is really real, yeah.  And that -- like that, uh, Smith guy, the Kennedy cousin.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I think the only reason it was that interesting was because it was a Kennedy cousin --
L:  Oh, exactly --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- there wasn't a whole lot to him except that he was --
R:  Mm mm.  
L:  -- you know, related.
R:  Yeah, and of course it was a thirty year old mystery so that was always kind of ... piqued you -- your interest too you know but, uh ...
L:  Mhm.  But you know, I watch even on TV, you know, just for mindless entertainment --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the Judge Judy's and --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I do too sometimes.  
L:  Some of those.
R:  I'm flipping in the afternoons and there's nothing else on.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I also enjoy, like, Law and Order because it kind of shows the frustration that the prosecutors go through, you know?
L:  Yeah.  You know, I don't get a chance to catch much late evening, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially the dramas and things like that but, um, I've -- I've seen a few of those and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're right.  It gives you the other perspective.
R:  Yeah, it's really kinda interesting.
L:  Uh, it maybe a bit glamorized or whatever but --
R:  Yeah, 'cause they have people throwing up road blocks trying to keep 'em from bringing this in and that in and -- and you get an idea of what you really don't hear when you're sitting on a jury, you know, that you really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ooh goodness!  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sounds like a fun afternoon at your house. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Hello?  [PAUSE] Hello?  [PAUSE] [inaudible] don't know what to do, whether to hang up or hang in or ... what.  [LAUGH] I can't talk to myself.  [PAUSE]  I don't know if I'm still connected or not.  Yeah ... ten minutes I'll be able to [inaudible].
