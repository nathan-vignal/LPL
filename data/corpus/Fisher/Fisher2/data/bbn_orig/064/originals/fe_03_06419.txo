R:  Hi.  My name is William and I'm from California.
L:  Hi William.  My name's Karen.  I'm from Florida.  How are you?
R:  Ah, I'm fine, and you? 
L:  Oh, very good thank you.  Um, I just wanted to double check and make sure, um, I -- that I [several inaudible words] -- that I've got the question clear, um, if that's okay with you?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, that's fine.
L:  Um, is it, um, it's -- basically I think it was terrorism and would you, um, it -- what is your feeling whether most people would panic or, um, how if -- or remain calm and how would you react?  Is that correct?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Um, did you want to start or how -- what are you -- what are you -- what are your thoughts on that?
R:  Ah, ladies first.
L:  Pardon me?
R:  L- ladies first.
L:  Oh, ladies first.  [LAUGH] Well, thank you.  Um, ah, actually well I -- I think kind of hands down and I think obviously we have a lot that's, ah, really, um, that, you know, basically I -- I guess since September eleventh it's pretty still fresh in your mind as far as what you think of in a -- in a major terrorist attack and I think it, um, typically, I mean, I -- ah, most people would probably panic and I think it's just, ah, something that you're not necessarily -- I mean, I don't know how that would have changed necessarily now.  Maybe people would feel a little bit more prepared but I think that it's just something that you can't really, um, fathom or -- or necessarily prepare yourself and it's fear of the unknown and all the different factors and it's just, um, ah, I think it's just a -- um, really, um, human nature to panic in something like that that's -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.
L:  -- very devastating, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um, and I think that the hands down I think that that's probably I would -- probably try to remain as calm as possible but I think that that would probably be impossible for me to do because, ah, especially, I think, having seen all of that and seeing all the -- the, ah, the tragedies and all the deaths and so forth and knowing that that potentially could be my fate, I think it would be hard to -- to stay calm and -- and be a leader or anything [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, um, how do feel?  Do you agree with that or -- 
R:  Ah, ah, I completely agree.  I think that people will just pretty much panic because they -- they -- they all -- like, they -- they try and pursue their own self interest which is self preservation.
L:  Right.
R:  And they'll just, like, panic and just try and save themselves.  Um -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, I -- I feel like maybe there'll probably be a select few who do try and help others.
L:  Sure.
R:  Ah, just like the -- the firemen and the police officers who helped other people, ah, during the -- the nine, one, one.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Ah, in terms of myself, I think that pretty much --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- since -- since I'm pretty young I -- I've become pretty desensitized to violence and just, like, you -- you don't really believe that it'll happen so if it does happen -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I feel that I -- I'll probably react, ah, to two extremes.  Either I will panic very much and be like everyone else or else I will see outside of what's happening and see it in a more worldly view where I will help a lot of people and just try and keep people as calm as possible.  But -- but, it -- it's like they say, you never really know until it happens.  So -- 
L:  Exactly.  How old are you, 'cause, I know -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- you mention being young?
R:  -- I'm eighteen.  How old are you -- 
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm actually thirty two so I was going to say so it, um -- you know, I -- I don't know.  I -- a- a- ah, it's very interesting to -- a- and I guess too like you said, 'cause you kind of have to -- you way into these factors.  If I was asked this prior -- probably prior to September eleventh I probably would have a very similar answer but I don't know.  It's funny because you almost think, like, well, gosh now that you've experienced all this devastation that perhaps you would, kind of -- it would taint you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In one regard of the other, as far as what your -- your view would be but I think that I wouldn't necessarily -- like I said, even though this has happened, feel anymore prepared or anything and I think that it would just -- and in fact, maybe even feel a little bit more frightened about it all because I -- you know, you saw the -- 
R:  'Cause you've already -- yeah, you've already seen it happen, yeah.
L:  -- effects of that, you know?  So, I don't know.  But, I -- I, like, a- again, is you have to really wait and I guess un- unfortunately.  Hopefully it will never have happened to us, either one of us -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  We will never be in that predicament.  But, I think that it, um -- yeah, it -- it -- you really can't, um, you can not predict, ah, how you react because it is so much, um, just seeing the events as they unfold, you know?
R:  Yeah, it's really on principle and it's like un- --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- unrealistic in a way.
L:  Right.  Right.  But, yeah, there were some interesting stories.  I know at least thinking back to September eleventh where there was, um, actually -- you know, there were some people who were able to help other people and kind of get them out of the buildings -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and, um -- and even those who were actually trapped in their themselves, not even the rescue workers.  And it's really interesting to see and that they might choose an alternate path and so forth to be able to try to get down even though the masses are kind of going one way -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- they're heading the other, and they were the ones who actually ended up living and stuff.  So, there are some people who could still keep their head on straight which is amazing to me in all of that, you know?
R:  Yeah, because -- yeah.
L:  [MN] 
R:  They -- they've been raised very well.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exact- -- I -- [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something I -- I -- just, you know, you don't know where -- where that [inaudible] comes from where all of a sudden they're able to -- to do that and to survive.  But, there is some sort of an instinct that seems to kick in for some people -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, you know, and I guess it's just that, some sort of a survival instinct.  And what's interesting though is panic probably is a result of people.  Like you said, the self preservation and kind of people being -- having this selfish sense of wanting to survive.  But -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's also that survival skill of a- -- you know, that somehow sometimes benefits others when you've got that in you to be that.  Kind of the, ah, the person who can take the lead and take control and kind of calm other people down and -- and kind of make a plan of action.  So -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- it's weird.  It can kind of manifest itself in two different directions, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and -- 
R:  I -- I totally [several inaudible words].
L:  -- maybe that's just personality driven or something.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, um, yeah, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gosh, what else can we think of to -- to add to that.  I guess it's -- it's, um, pretty interesting that we -- you know, it's kind of -- I guess I think most people would probably have to, um, side with the fact that, you know, that they would think that most people would panic.  I think that probably would be a small percentage that would think that the majority might remain calm, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I like one percent -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- totally, yeah.
L:  Right.  Absolutely.  Have you ever been in a situation where you have, um, that was anything similar to that at all?  I mean, has there ever -- ah, I don't know, I guess, um, [MN] -- well, known anybody that was actually involved in any of the attacks or anything or --  
R:  Pretty much myself personally and know like the closest I've been was just, like -- like fire alarms and stuff in my -- my dorm.  And then pretty much when it happened it's so late because it's just some guy that [several inaudible words].  You're so sleepy and groggy -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that you -- you just head towards the fire [LAUGH] escape and you just -- you just get down there and that.  Well -- well, that's just me and like -- yeah, so, I -- I'm just -- ah, yeah, oh yeah.  Like, ah --  
L:  Yeah, yeah, I almost have this -- well, this kind of, like -- you know, like you said, it's just your, um -- then well, this -- it's almost an ingrained kind of thing where you're just -- you're just going through the motions or whatever 'cause you're accustomed to it and you're half asleep.  You're just kind of -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- sleepwalking yourself out of there.  But, at least it -- at least it kicks in and you know what you're supposed to do even though you're half asleep.  So, that's pretty [LAUGH] good -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know?  And maybe because it's, um -- maybe there's a lot of false alarms and therefore you're, you know, you're desensitized to just that, the fire alarm.  You're not ever thinking it's really going to be the true thing.  [LAUGH] You know -- 
R:  Yeah.  So -- so -- oh, I -- I guess -- yeah, I guess that's a -- that's a good [LAUGH] way.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah -- 
L:  It's almost like crying wolf or something in a weird sense.  If you hear things too many times then too it's strange because, like -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- it can kind of numb you towards something where you wouldn't really react, you know?
R:  That -- that's pretty funny.  M- maybe the college is actually doing this on purpose.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  There you go.  Absolutely.  You've got to derive it from something, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Um, interesting though.  Yeah, I -- I personally have never been in any kind of, um, really any kind of a traumatic situation like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've never, you know, had some -- you know, the plane's going to crash or been in a -- involved in a robbery or anything and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I just, um, I really -- like, I said, I have to just kind of, ah, guess who -- 
R:  Wing it.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wing it.
L:  I don't have anything that I could even kind of think of that was really an alarming situation.  I've been fortunate so far, knock on -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wood, you know?
R:  I hope that continues for you -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and for -- for -- all -- all this -- all people around us as well.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, um, goodness.  Let's see.  What else is there.  [LAUGH] Some topics are -- are -- are -- are easier than others because it's -- it's -- sometimes it's funny when you agree, um -- 
R:  Yeah, like, wh- when you -- when you disagree then you can debate it.  Um, but -- 
L:  Ex- -- 
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Exactly.  But, when you agree it's kind of like -- and then it's kind of like, "Well, gosh, we've drawn this conclusion".  It's kind of a- after that point, it's like -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well, where do you go from there?  [LAUGH] You can, like -- 
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- wade in -- into new directions, I suppose or, um -- 
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- make different spins off of it.
R:  Yeah.  Um, let me see.  Mm, ah.  Um, mm, [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That all right.  Um, let's see what else can we think of though.  Um --  
R:  Ah -- I -- I think that, um, in terms of self preservation some people might -- I -- I just have to hope that I get put into a situation where there are people around me who are helpful -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
R:  -- and then this way they can assist me as well.
L:  Absolutely.  Yeah, it's -- it's, um, that -- that is great 'cause even if you yourself -- you're hopeful that you do find someone who is a very benevolent sole that can, um, you know, can keep a clear headed, um, mind or -- and -- or can just can have the clear thought about them and -- and, um, be able to help those in need, you know?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Um, absolutely.  Yeah, I -- and I know I would -- I would try my best but I think, um, I think I would feel I might be more prone to do it if I was someone who were, like, let's say in nine eleven where I could have escaped the building and then -- 
R:  And then gone back.
L:  -- and then gone back somehow and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- s- -- yeah, absolutely.  And then try to help, you know, knowing that I'm safe.  But, I think that instinct is just kind of, like, you got to have that flee thing where you got to get out first -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before you can think about others in a certain sense, you know?
R:  'Cause it -- pretty much it's built into people, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  But, um, yeah.
R:  Do you think that, um, nine eleven has made people more aware of -- of their surroundings where -- whether they're, like, more cautious?
L:  Oh, probably so.  I know that, ah, me personally, if I'm going into some place like -- I guess particularly like with an airport and things like that, I think that I'm a little bit more cautious too as -- but, as far as planes and flights and so forth and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.  I think maybe -- maybe altogether though as a whole.  I can't think of other situations, but I would imagine that, um, I imagine that people can't help but to think about that somewhat?  Do you agree or ... 
R:  Um, yeah, I think like, ev- -- yeah, everyone's -- yeah.  It was -- man, too much agreeing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Too much agreeing.
L:  Got to find something to argue about.  All right.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Um, hm, I -- I think that the airport wait is too long and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that -- and the security tax is -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the -- the security tax --
