L:  Hello?
R:  Oh, no.  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Jackie.
R:  Hi, I'm Adrian. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  Um, [LIPSMACK] uh, oh, well, you can go first. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, um, I've watched some ... some shows on Court TV and, uh, it's kind of like I feel like a voyeur.  It's a lurid interest.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um ... I mean, I guess I think for public ... just for the need for public to see, it's not such a bad idea but I guess deep down I believe they shouldn't really be televised. 
L:  I know.  Like, I've just been at it -- um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I just think that when you -- when -- when it comes to, uh, trials and different, like, things like that it seems like a private matter but I guess it's up to the people participating to decide on whether or not they want, you know, that type of information, like, televised on live television for anybody to see.
R:  Right.  At one time, you know, they -- they weren't even allowed to, you know, have -- have videographers or photographers --
L:  Yeah, I mean, it was closed -- 
R:  --and they were just like doing illustrations.
L:  -- to the public.  And now they have it where you can watch just about anything from any different types of, um, [SIGH] trials.  Even, like, you know, it just -- I mean, really, really bad situations.  There's murders and different things like that.
R:  Yeah, I think, um -- I mean, I -- I know it appeals to my voyeuristic instincts but I think in principle it's not a good idea because it, just, um, doesn't really serve ... you know, the jury or the judge or the ... or the defendant or the -- or the counsel so there's no compelling reason to have it on TV.  Just except for like, uh, voyeuristic, uh ... you know, interest. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I guess it all depends on the person too.  [NOISE] But I don't know and -- and -- and then I guess it's optional for people to watch it, you know?  I think that's what it is.  I mean, I don't know.  Some people you -- some people [several inaudible words] amusement or entertainment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, some people might even get useful information from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.  Like, I guess, they have different reasons for televising and I've watched them.  Sometimes I've kind of watched them for my own interest.  Out of curiosity 'cause I've never ... you know, a lot of situations it's -- it's kind of shocking ... to see [inaudible] --
R:  I mean, I guess there are compelling, you know, educational reasons and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- public interest reasons but, um, I don't know.  It's -- yeah, it just depends, like, uh, I think in some way it's just like for people watching the movie -- the show Cops, you know?  
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  See how, um, sensationalistic it can get.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, but I have to admit when they're high profile cases, I'm curious to watch them too.
L:  Yeah, me too.  Well, I know Cops is one that I do watch a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And, um, I don't know, it's just kinda interesting sometimes.  I guess when you -- you live in an environment where you don't see things like that everyday it's kind of ... I don't know.  But --
R:  I mean, yeah, sometimes like I think people get bored in their own lives so they need to --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, add -- get -- add to the excitement by watching these things and imagining them, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I don't know.  I think it appeals to our baser instincts.  It's like certain talk shows. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yes, some like -- yes.  [inaudible] it's just -- I don't know.  It just all depends on the, I guess, the audience too.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't -- I mean, I think in some cases it's not something that kids should watch.  You know, I think it should be more, um, censored.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or you know, the -- the [several inaudible words] usually if they're adults more so than kids.
R:  Right, right.
L:  The only bad thing about that is that kids can turn to stuff like that and watch it which, um, exposes them to a lot of things I don't think they're at an age where they should be watching it but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, that's the only thing that I have against it is -- is ... um, it should be more censored as far as the targeted audience I think.
R:  I find the after -- after trial commentary interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like, I like to watch the ... you know, the broadcaster and maybe interview some lawyers or ... you know, defense lawyers or pla- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, or plaintiff lawyers and just get some insight as to what's going on.  That --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, is kind of interesting.
L:  It is.  I agree.
R:  But, yeah, I think, um ... some of it's not fit for, you know, young kids or --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people who ... [LAUGH] I don't know, maybe there'll be some copycat crimes too --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- so you never know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, you just worry about the influence as far as ... certain people that do watch them now.  What they get from it and how they take it and what they do ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after watching it.  I mean, I think that's a concern but --
R:  Right.
L:  Uh --
R:  Well, I don't have cable TV anyway so normally I don't have the opportun- --
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I watched it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's, uh ... you know, I mean, I -- it's also the only broadcaster ones that have the more, uh ... some lurid and sensationalistic aspects, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah, they do.  They do.
R:  Boy, ten minutes is a long time.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  I think, uh --
L:  And I can talk and talk and talk normally.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But then the [inaudible] --
R:  I know but I think I'm, uh ... running out of comments too. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what else they want to get --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- from this [inaudible] [LAUGH].  I guess as to whether we watch and we should both agree.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what we think about it which we said.  Um [LAUGH] so --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, let's see.  
L:  But --
R:  I know the Ira Irnhorn[?] trial was one that I kinda wanted to see.  I forget whether they had it or not but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um ... you know, there's just certain ones that have special human --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- interest aspects that -- that appeal to --
L:  I know, and then too a lot of -- I think there's in some cases -- some major cases that the media has really hyped up.  They kind of made it -- it a drama, uh, it's really just the media.  I- it's -- it's a [inaudible] media just like the news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where they, um, insulate for them to project something -- something either that they feel people need to know, be aware of, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Then there's been some major cases that I mean, you know, people in the public eye, celebrities and what have you and I mean, it's just a shame that they put them -- I mean, they're already in the public eye as is and then they have their own personal life or problems that people go through every day just broadcast all over television.  That's the only thing that I have a pro- -- I mean, it's kinda interesting but then it makes you think, "I don't want my life broadcast all over television" --
R:  Right, exactly and I th- --
L:  -- if I did something wrong.
R:  Exactly and I -- 
L:  You know?
R:  -- I feel bad for like the children of, you know, the people involved --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- in a way or, you know.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  If it's broadcast all over the place and they have to deal with, uh ... you know, the repercussions of that.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  Everybody recognizing their parent's faces or whatever.
L:  Oh, yeah.  As if, you know, people -- even as a -- a certain lifestyle don't have circum- circumstances to happen to them like everyday people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that's the only thing that I would disagree with too is that, um, you're already -- you're already in the public eye.  I guess that's something that you kind of exp- -- you know, you grow to accept but then perhaps ... [SIGH] bad things, exploitive like they are, you know?
R:  Yeah, it's like adding salt to the wound, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the only other thing I can think of --
R:  Maybe --
L:  -- that I would disagree with.
R:  Yeah, maybe unnecessarily adding to the ... [SIGH] -- you know, to the -- to the hardships --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- of the people involved.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, if it was something like -- like, you know, war crimes like Nuremberg trials or something --
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  -- in a way, like, I think it definitely should be televised --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but something just involving, you know, one ... you know, maybe offender or something in ... in a state.  I don't know.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Maybe that's less necessary.  But, uh ...
L:  You know, like somebody [LAUGH] ... the celebrity who shot [several inaudible words]?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That may have a problem. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, nobody really wa- -- I mean, everybody goes through that every day so I mean ... I -- I don't know if they expect the people to get from that that this is something that can happen everyday to anybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Even regardless of what their lifestyle is or what, you know, social pressure?
R:  Right.
L:  But, um -- [LIPSMACK]
R:  It's kind of like, um, Jerry, um ... Springer or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  That's the only thing that I wouldn't look forward to is, um, when you already live a li- high profile lifestyle like that and then to have it blasted all over the television is just, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  That's -- I don't know.  I just -- that's one thing I disagree with.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wouldn't, you know, some of the -- some of the cases that I've seen it's just ridiculous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's all about people making money off a somebody else's misery or problems or, you know, things that they're going through and, um, when it comes down to money.  And I mean, w- when it's a situation where I don't think the audience have a whole lot to gain from it, I disagree with those types of ... trials that are televised.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, I mean, so it's public awar- awareness, yeah, that's one thing but I think to just attack someone, you know, in the media ... as a way to make money or to, um, give credit to someone else as a result I just disagree with that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, there's a lot of, um, reporters and, um, legal -- well, you know, people -- attorneys or what have you that were involved with major cases and they got a lot of credit.  You know what I'm saying?  Just for being involved.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And, um, I just think it takes away from ... like, what was [inaudible] ... the more, like, affected purpose should be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I think that in some cases ... it's a weapon for the name of the person they were representing or --
