L:  Oh, okay, good.
R:  Yeah, very nice.  Okay [LAUGH] this is your first call?
L:  Uh, my -- actually my second.
R:  Oh, mine too.  Great.  [LAUGH] Welcome to the club.  Okay, so you know the topic right?
L:  Yeah, um, terrorism.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  Oh, well [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's interesting. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  They want us to tell, you know, how we would react.  Would we remain calm or panicky?  How --
L:  I know -- well, you know what?
R:  -- how would other people react?
L:  Well, it depends on what kind of terrorism.  I mean, is it -- if it's right in your area, you're gonna panic no matter what.  [LAUGH]
R:  In totally.
L:  Um ...
R:  I agree. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't know.  That's -- it's too vague. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  So, wh- maybe we have to come up with some like scenarios type thing.
L:  I don't know what they mean, like, um ... [SIGH] I don't know.  It's ... I mean, how would you react?  It depends.  It -- it depends, I mean, if it's right in your area, I -- I would be, you know --
R:  Panicking?
L:  Extremely, yeah, I would be extremely nervous I think probably. 
R:  Extremely.
L:  I worry about family or friends and ...
R:  Yep.
L:  -- stuff like that and you know, most likely I probably would be stuck at work [LAUGH] when that happens, right?
R:  R- right.  Mhm.
L:  So, e- -- I don't know, an- the different -- I mean, you know, either they meant like ... in broad, like we had at nine one one thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Everybody was like concerned.  People were like ... shocked.  I w- -- most the -- I actually, um, I wanted to go home that day and we were gonna get dismissed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we went home and I just sat there and watched TV all day. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [NOISE] Well, I -- I live in the area so I was actually able to smell the smoke.
L:  Ew.
R:  It even came to Brooklyn and I saw ashes flying around even, um -- I live in, uh, southern Brooklyn near the water, pretty far from the World Trade Center and I was able to see ashes on my car as I was driving home.  Where I worked, they dismissed us.  They -- you know, they -- they, um --
L:  That's -- that's good, yeah.
R:  They dismissed --
L:  See, you were -- oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah, that -- oh my -- yeah, that -- that's something like I don't like -- oh my God were like -- that -- that had to be ke- -- that ... did you guys like feel it?  Did you hear the noise?
R:  Um ... no.  I didn't hear the noise but we smelled smoke in Brooklyn for about, mmm, about a week afterwards.  For about a week and then the air quality was ... 
L:  Bad.
R:  -- terrible.  [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, I -- I had heard that.  They said smelled like metal and all kinds a -- oh.
R:  Yeah, we --
L:  Yeah, I heard that.  
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  I, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I have, um, my actually -- my parents went to visit.  They went -- they went to see the area --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a month afterwards and my brother went.  I didn't even go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm -- it's funny, my -- you know, they went to New York city for a couple of days but ... um, yeah, that -- I mean, so you gu- -- you guys were let go early.  Yeah, that -- I mean it's like [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, and I work in Brooklyn.  Very far from the World Trade Center but, yes, we were let go.  They -- they cancelled everything that day, yeah.
L:  I think a lot of businesses th- -- yeah, a lot of people probably would have said, "I wanna go anyway".
R:  Yeah, oh yeah, definitely.
L:  Because it was too much.
R:  Definitely, definitely.
L:  Too much going on.
R:  Yeah and, um ... a lot of people around me were very, uh, very much in a state of, uh, extreme ... heightened, uh ... you know, awareness and -- and nervousness and, uh, several people I know ... 
L:  They probably had -- know people that work there.
R:  Yes.
L:  That worked --
R:  Yes, yes.  Or I knew pe- -- or I knew people who knew people who worked there.  So, it -- yeah, I mean, it touched -- it touched every --
L:  That's what -- yeah.
R:  -- every part of -- of this area and -- and wh- -- talk about panic.  Um, I was in Manhattan I think the Saturday after and -- because I go to Manhattan on Saturdays and ... you know, Manhattan's usually a pretty, um, p- pleasant and fairly orderly place even though it's very he- you know, congested and --
L:  It was chaotic, right?
R:  -- I'm sure you've -- have you been to Manhattan?
L:  No, but was -- was that day was chaotic?
R:  Oh, well ... well, yeah --
L:  Just --
R:  -- I mean, I went that next Saturday and even the following Saturdays and ... for like a month afterwards on the Saturdays when I went, you would hear ... these sirens con- -- almost con- -- not constantly but sirens, you know, of fire trucks and ambulances and ... and, um, usually you don't hear that many sirens in Manhattan but it was -- we saw so many sirens and heard so many sirens and the air quality was terrible and ... [LIPSMACK] everybody was just -- everybody looked shell shocked.  I remember crying ... on the trains because people would -- we'd be reading the papers and people would leave papers and we -- I -- the pap- -- you know, they did such beautiful coverage but it was so sad, you know, and I remember cry- uh, I remember crying almost every time I read the paper on the trains and -- and we were all just shell shocked, you know?  It was --
L:  Oh, yeah, well, you came right from the area.  That -- I al- -- yeah, actually in -- yeah, 'cause I mean, you're right there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Right, so how did you feel being far away?  Did you feel panicky or -- or --
L:  No, just kinda --
R:  -- calm or --
L:  -- n- -- well, not nervous or something, you know.  Not really knowing, you know, how many more planes were th- --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I heard rumors that there were more ... you know, they might have stopped a few when the grounded the planes, um, you know, not knowing and then, of course, I -- I work -- I work downtown --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, in the county building at that point and ...
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then well, I didn't really wanna be downtown at that time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We had actually after that we had a lot of bomb scares.
R:  Oh, yes, yes.
L:  It was crazy.  Fol- -- people were just making at the Hall of Justice Department they cut making false calls.  I think from a payphone stuff, and a lot of times I was leaving work they would -- police'd be down and they don't say anything.  Just have to start, um, taping off the area and this went on for weeks and --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- weeks.
R:  Yes, that happened here in New York also.
L:  And it probably just died, then it just stopped.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, yeah, I think --
R:  Thank God.
L:  -- they did catch the person.  I don't even know if it was more than one person but it was really -- it was annoying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was really annoying.  After that it was just completely ... so that was -- I mean, that -- to be downtown that day.  I didn't wanna be downtown.  We actually had TVs that work and I was driving to work when the first thing happened and I heard it on, um, the radio.  Actually had Howard Stern on which I don't even [LAUGH] like that much.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But h- he thought it was like -- he wasn't even sure what it was either.  Nobody really -- and then I think I flicked to another station but I went back to him and -- and someone said that this is for real so I could- -- I had to park my car and I had to walk a couple of blocks just to get into work to find out what was going on but --
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  -- that was weird.
R:  It was very shocking.
L:  There was a lot of people that, you know, know people that had friends or somebody wor- working --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in that area.  People --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- with a lot of concern.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's actually New York.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think more than any other state.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.  That's true.
L:  You know, a lot of people across the country ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- were probably still sleeping; in California it's a three hour difference.
R:  Oh, right, that's -- that's, uh ... yes, yes, that's true.  It's true.  They [inaudible] --
L:  Well, I mean, the time -- the time that they turn on their TV probably was three hours later.
R:  Right, so they probably not -- they probably didn't feel the thing impact --
L:  Or the y- yeah.
R:  -- that the people who were watching it live.
L:  Les- you know, less, I mean, uh -- thing unless people get up about five, six o'clock, you know, and start turning the TV on.  Well, most people don't even, you know --
R:  It's right.  That's true.  Wow.  Yeah.
L:  Interesting but --
R:  Y- uh --
L:  -- [inaudible] now -- now we're back in high alert.
R:  Yeah, I was just about to say that.
L:  So, yeah --
R:  I was just about to say that.
L:  -- we've had more terrorist --
R:  Now they've made it orange or something?
L:  -- but I think -- yeah.
R:  And why did they do that?  Because of the ... why did they do that again?
L:  Um, Saudi -- it was the Saudi Arabian massacre -- I ma- -- I forgot the other country.  Um, the other -- th- they're out ... the other countries that had terrorism.  Some Americans did that.  I think it was Saudi Arabia and somebody else.  Another -- another country.  I forgot the names of 'em but um, there were some suicide bombers too.  Those both --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Those are the --
R:  Right, right, right, right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And did you hear how they c- -- right.
L:  Those are the ones that make it worse.
R:  Okay.  Did you hear how they caught the ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this guy in New York city recently aro- around this area?  Th- they -- this guy who -- who was attempting to buy like all these explosives?
L:  No, I didn't even hear about that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Was that in the news?
R:  Yep and how his neighbor said that he was going by like ten different names and that he -- he was exchanging suitcases, this and that with people and that --
L:  Oh, Go- --
R:  -- you know, he seemed very suspicious and that they called the police but no one did anything and it turns out he was ... somehow -- they found out somehow ... um -- they're linking him to terrorism.  Um --
L:  Good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and -- but they got him on a drug charge.  I think he had some --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- drugs but they're -- they're -- they're investigating but, um, he was attempting to -- to buy a lot of explosives.
L:  Did he live in New York city?
R:  I don't know.  I mean --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- with these terrorists, they don't really live anywhere.  Even if they're just ca- --
L:  No, they're [several inaudible words] there's -- there's --
R:  You know what I mean?  But I think -- I think maybe -- I think in Queens or something, yeah.
L:  There's a lot of groups all over.  They had -- they had r- -- I don't know if it was a year ago or so they had some in Buffalo they caught.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And I was actually down there [inaudible] vis- -- I was, uh -- I was at that area near that church with my friends and their parents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We were visiting.  We were going down to Niagara Falls and we stopped there.  We stopped to, um, travel around and go for some stores in Buffalo.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we were right on that block. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unbelievable.
L:  Well, and then they also found out there's some groups that might've had charity money, s- some of the colleges.
R:  Mm.
L:  Near abouts so --
R:  Right.  Right, right.
L:  They, uh, there's --
R:  You know, you wanted to -- you want to talk about, uh -- that's terrible, I'm so sorry.  Y- you know, I -- I pass on the bus -- I go to Manhattan on Saturdays.  I go over their too but I still have Saturdays and I take the, uh, an express bus and every day, every Saturday, it passes the site and at first I couldn't look.
L:  No, I -- I would -- I -- you know, yeah.  I would imagine it'd be very hard --
R:  [MN] It is. 
L:  -- to -- to see that.
R:  At first I couldn't look but now I just pass it and I'm okay with it but I couldn't -- I could barely even look the first few times.
L:  Yeah, and the other thing is --
R:  I have never been --
