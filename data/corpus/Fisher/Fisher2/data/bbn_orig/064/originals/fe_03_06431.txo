R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Danielle.
L:  My name's Lyn.
R:  Hi, Lyn.  I live in North Dakota.
L:  Oh!  Well, I live in Colorado.
R:  Oh!  You got a beautiful state.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it is pretty.  I've, um, only been to North Dakota once and it was nice.
R:  [LAUGH] Would you like to go first?
L:  Sure.  I guess, I think I would probably panic.  But, I don't know, [SIGH] you know --
R:  I --
L:  -- until you're in a situation I'm not quite sure [PAUSE] --
R:  For -- for me --
L:  -- if I -- how I would react.
R:  Yeah.  And if I think it ha- -- if it happened here I -- I am a mom with three kids, I know that I would be panicked.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I kind of feel sort of safe in Colorado 'cause I live in a small town in -- on the western slopes.  I'm not close to Denver or to Colorado Springs or to any of the military stuff.
R:  And in North Dakota, I'm not by anything but farmers' fields.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- maybe that's kind of a silly way to feel but I think that, um, they're not going to mess with us.  I mean, why would you do something big to get at just a few people?
R:  Yeah.  And -- and we feel the same way here.  It's just, like, there's nothing here.  There's no reason to attack; you wouldn't get much if you -- if you bombed us right here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But, um, I was in Washington DC last month 'cause a friend and I went down there just to visit.  I got -- my sister lives in Virginia --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and stuff and ... I don't know, it just didn't seem like -- well, all the Smithsonian and everything, they were really checking bags and stuff.  I mean, you couldn't go --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in without being checked.  And they've got barricades everyplace.  But I don't know, if there --
R:  Did it make you more cautious to leave and go on the trip?
L:  Um, not really.  I decided, well, maybe it was kind of a dumb idea to be going but we'd already scheduled it before the war started and it was after, you know, supposedly everything was over.  But, um ...
R:  And now we're on high terror alert again.
L:  I know.  It's just, you know, there's so many people in this world that are just nuts.  You know, this suicide bombing thing, I just ...
R:  But again, I think to myself they wouldn't come to North Dakota.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, because, you know, my personal opinion is why would they want to show up in a place like this.  And that's nice I think.  I like living in an area that's ...
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't wanna live in a big city.  I think I'd be more scared if I lived --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a big city.
L:  Yeah.  I grew up outside of Chicago and then I lived in Denver for a while so I'm used to big cities, sort of, but I haven't lived in one for, like, thirty years so, it's --
R:  And we don't have mul- -- much -- much of a melting pot here.  It's pretty much all whites, Norwegian --
L:  Yeah.  Right.  You don't have too many, um, Arabs or Muslims or ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] I can -- I could say that I -- there goes by days where I don't see any.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, I don't, I guess -- and that's probably more of a reason that I'm not too p- -- worried because I just don't see it.  It's not part of my daily life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I don't see it.
L:  Yeah.  I don't [PAUSE] I just can't even imagine living in, like, New York or -- or even Washington or [PAUSE] places where you're thinking wow, there's all these millions of people and they could easily decide that they were going to be a suicide -- suicide bomber.
R:  Yeah, we talk -- I said I'd love to see New York but I said, "I don't think I want to see it now".  I think it'll be a few years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before I'd even think I'd want to go visit.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  'Cause you just -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- you never when it is going to happen.
L:  Uh-uh.  And I don't know, they've got all this, um, [PAUSE] stuff where they hear things and that's why I guess they raise the terrorist alert to orange or red --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what is it, orange?  
R:  Yep.
L:  Um, [PAUSE] but it's kind of odd because I just think that, well, if they know what they re doing, why can't they find them?
R:  Well, and how did it happen in New York?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  If they -- if they hear all that stuff and they knew something was going to happen, then why wasn't it stopped?  Or intercepted?  Or ...
L:  Mhm.  We were just pretty naive about the whole thing I think.  But I can remember that the morning of the eleventh -- and I go to coffee every morning with a bunch of friends and [PAUSE] I saw the first plane hit.  And I'm thinking, "Wow, that's really a freaky accident".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and it just never dawned on me.  And even after the planes had hit and they said, "Well, there's a plane down in Pennsylvania".  And I'm so stupid I'm thinking. "Well, that doesn't have anything to do with it".
R:  It's -- I'm a teacher so, it wasn't e- -- we didn't even know 'cause there's no TVs and we don't get outside television channels.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, none of us knew until one teacher's spouse called in and said, "You need to logon to the internet and see what's going on" and explained it.  And she came and told everybody. The principal said, "Don't be panicked, don't be shocked.  Go on with your regular day.  It's the parents' jobs to explain this to the kids so, we are not going to talk about it".  And so, our day was -- just ran the same but, uh, you know --
L:  Really?
R:  -- in every corner were teachers whispering, "Oh, my goodness, what's going to happen?"
L:  Oh, 'cause that really seems like you would have done something before the day was over.
R:  No.  They wanted parents to be able to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- talk to their kids first so they wouldn't -- kids wouldn't panic in school and be all distraught. 
L:  Yeah.  Course [PAUSE] again in the middle of North Dakota you'd think that, um, [PAUSE] I don't know.  [SIGH]  So, what happened after though?  Um, did you have school the next day?
R:  Oh, yeah.  The -- life never stopped, it just went on normal here every day.
L:  Hm.  Are you in, like, a farming community?
R:  No.  I live in Fargo.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I mean, there's -- there's seventy thousand here and th- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- eighty thousand in Moorhead.  So, it -- it -- it's not really small but it just -- it was just another day and the teachers talked about it but there was no news coverage or anything and ...
L:  Huh.
R:  People -- well, there was one teacher whose family's in the military so she was really panicked because she was worried about her -- her dad lives on a naval base --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and so, she was very nervous.  But for the rest of us it was like, "Oh, I don't even know anybody in New York".  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, course that's true.  I mean, you know, it's hard to relate to things that have no context in your life.
R:  And when you're not -- you're so far away.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's like a different world.
R:  Mhm.  And it did seem like it was a different world.  I said it was very scary the first day 'cause it was hard to believe.  But I said as the days went on it was like, "That's, like, a whole world away to me".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because here nothing looked any different.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, people weren't any different.  'Cause it's even -- I travel quite a bit and usually I go to Mexico and I'm -- people say, "Well, aren't you afraid to fly?"  I said, "Well, no, not really" because actually you're -- nobody's going to mess with Mexico.  Nobody wants Mexico.  You know, I mean, that's just another world too and, you know, if I was going to be a terrorist and wanting to do something, it certainly wouldn't be to Mexico.
R:  Well, and I just think, fly?  Well, flying +you're just as likely to get hit driving a car or anything else --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- to happen, so ...
L:  -- or walking across the street or anything.  Because there's so much security now in all the airports that, um, you know, if I was going to do something, it certainly wouldn't be in an airport because that's where everybody's looking for you.
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess I -- I feel very fine just to get out and fly to go someplace.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't worry about it.
L:  But I wonder about that thing at Yale yesterday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I wonder if that had ... something -- it just sounds like it couldn't help but have something to do with it.
R:  And again, that's just a bigger school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with a lot more people and more well known.  And I think the universities here aren't ... [LAUGH] aren't as well know.  We have three colleges here in town.
L:  Oh, really.  In Fargo?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Th- yeah, we have NDFU and, um, Moorhead State and, um, Concordia.  
L:  I thought Moorhead was in Minnesota.
R:  Yep.  Right on the other side.  It's just like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- walking across the street.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's very close.  Like, see we have three universities and [PAUSE] I guess if I thought that I was going to see more multicultural, um, diversity, it is on the university.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But all of those students live on campus and work on campus so, they don't [PAUSE] -- they don't leave campus and I don't see them.
L:  Right.  And you wouldn't have any reason to have contact with them really, unless you're involved in the university.
R:  Um -- um, I just graduated last week.  Went back for my masters.
L:  Oh!
R:  And so, I said to my husband, I said, "I do see 'em there but" I said, "I always see them when I'm leaving class at night and" I said, "they're washing the floors or working there".
L:  Yeah.  They're not -- 
R:  And so, I said, "Uh, you just walk by and you say, 'Hi'" and ...
L:  Well, yeah.  It's -- 'cause it's just part of life and -- 
R:  Everyday life.  I said to him I don't --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- fear that any of them are suicide bom- --
