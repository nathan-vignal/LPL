L:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Sheryl.
R:  This is Rachel.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You sound like you got a busy house behind you. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Pardon?
R:  I said, you sound like you have a busy house behind you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, sorry about that.  We had somebody knock at the door and my dog is barking.
R:  Oh, I totally understand.  I have two myself.  Oh, so what are we supposed to talk about? [SIGH]
L:  I think criminal trials.
R:  On TV.
L:  And whether we think they should be televised or not.
R:  Wow.  I think it's ridiculous. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I don't like it.
L:  I don't either.  I think it's stupid and a waste of time.
R:  It -- you know it g- -- it ... doesn't give the person a fair trial either because everyone has preconceived notions before the trial even starts.  
L:  Yep.
R:  It just --
L:  I agree with you one hundred percent.
R:  I just don't understand how they can even expect to get a fair jury pool when everyone knows about it.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, I -- uh, I think they've got one here in Kansas where I live --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where they're having to go out of state because it was so televised that they're going to St. Lois to pursue the trial there.
R:  Oh my gosh!
L:  Not --
R:  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I think it's just ridiculous.  I mean, they shouldn't be -- I don't think even cameras should be in the courtrooms.
R:  I know it's ... you know, it -- it -- [SIGH] and it just -- it glamorizes all the negative things.  It glamorizes criminals and it glamorizes their crimes and, you know, it doesn't set a good example for children.  [LAUGH] You know, 'cause they -- they just see these guys on TV ... whether it's good or bad, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Have you done this before?
R:  I've done it once.
L:  This is my second time too.  Did you --
R:  Oh, it was -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- get paid for the last time?
R:  Uh, no, I was just -- about a week ago so, no, not yet.
L:  Because I haven't been p- --
R:  But I talked to another guy.  The other guy I talked to last time had done like three or four and he had already gotten paid.
L:  Uh, I was just curious if I was ever [LAUGH] gonna get a check [inaudible].
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] If it's like -- if it's like other stuff like this, you usually get the m- -- the month following, so you'll probably get it some time in June.
L:  Well, I sh- -- it's been about two or three months since I did the last one.  I still --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- haven't got [inaudible].  Yeah.
R:  Oh wow.  No, this guy I talked to last time said he'd already gotten paid.
L:  Hm.
R:  He had done like three -- maybe you get paid after your third one because I think he said he's done three already and this was his --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fourth one.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I am so sorry.
R:  So, you're in Kansas?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Where are you at?
R:  Dallas.
L:  Oh, I love Dallas.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have a friend that lives --
R:  It was actually really pretty today.
L:  I have a friend that lives in Fort Worth and I used to go down there every single year and stay about two weeks down there.  I love Texas period.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  [SIGH] [PAUSE] But, [COUGH] um, things are [inaudible] --
R:  So, you guys have a case going on right now where it's been really televised?
L:  Yeah, it was for the guy -- I don't know if you heard about it or not.  Some man, uh, killed a bunch of women and put them in barrels.
R:  Oh my God!  No.
L:  And buried them out in his property and what's really weird about this, I knew the man.
R:  [MN]
L:  I had been staying in the trailer park that he managed and I had an incident with him.  He came in drunk one night and he was supposed -- the people I was living with asked him to check on me because my ex husband was doing all kinds of crazy things, and he came in the door one night uninvited and was drunk and I couldn't get him to leave.
R:  Oh!
L:  And my boyfriend happened to call, and I told him that he was there and he was giving me the creeps and so my boyfriend came over 'cause I was in the bathtub when I heard the door open.
R:  Oh my God!
L:  And I came out and I had a -- like a blanket wrapped around me and I had a nightgown on 'cause that was the -- about the quickest thing that I could put on.
R:  Sure. [LAUGH]
L:  And my boyfriend came over and made him leave.
R:  Oh my God!
L:  And then it turned out, like, a couple of months later what -- oh my God, that could have been me in one of those barrels.
R:  Oh!  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] I bet you were totally freaked out.
L:  Oh yes.  [LAUGH] I still am to even think about it.
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  But I guess he also had killed some women in -- in Missouri and that's why, um, Kansas already tried him and found him guilty and he's got the death penal- penalty.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And now Missouri's trying -- re- uh, retrialing him for what he did to the Missouri women.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That I guess -- I'm not sure what town -- I think it's Kansas City, Missouri, is where they wanted to try him but now they're going to St. Lois so that they can get a fair trial.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  That I'm assuming since he did that in Missouri that even in St. Lois they would have at least heard about this story.
R:  Oh yeah, you'd think.
L:  But --
R:  Well, right down here, you know, the two big stories down here have been the ... that lady that ran over her husband down in Houston.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my God.
R:  She was back on the news the other night with a -- with a -- um, interview from jail.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And then the lady that killed her children.
L:  Somebody killed their children?
R:  Oh, yeah -- oh, yes.  She -- she drowned, like, five of 'em.
L:  Oh my God.
R:  Five of her children.  [NOISE] That was a few months ago.  Oop.  Hold on one sec.  [NOISE] Sorry about that.  I -- I was expecting that.
L:  Oh, th- that's okay.
R:  Um [SIGH], and then what was the other one that was kind of weird around here?  [PAUSE] [SIGH] Well, you know, a year -- I don't know, it may have been longer than that -- that now, the -- that railroad murderer guy?  Well, the one that was murdering people up and down the railroad line?
L:  I haven't even heard of that one.  I try not to watch the news.
R:  And he's, uh -- he's about to be put to death, or he's appealed it for the last time or whatever --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so that's finally gonna end, I think.  It's just, you know, it's  -- there's some scary people out there.
L:  Yeah, it makes you wonder what's wrong with the world anymore because I remember when I was a kid you could leave your doors unlocked and --
R:  Oh, I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- people would help you if you were alongside the road.  And now you're afraid to even have them --
R:  You knew -- if you actually knew your neighbors!
L:  -- stop to help you.
R:  Well, yeah, and I mean, actually one of my neighbor's sons stopped to pick somebody up and they attacked him ...
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  -- and, yeah, like, just beat him up and stole his car and -- I mean, almost killed him and ever since then it's been, like, do not stop and pick people up.  And it's like, you know, they could really need help!  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you hate to just turn your back on 'em but it literally could be ... someone out to hurt you and you just don't know.
L:  Yep.  I don't know about people today.  There's ...
R:  I just -- I w- ...  Do you live in a city or do you live in a small town?
L:  Um, I did live in a small town.  I'm living in a, um, fairly large city right now.
R:  Oh, yeah?  And it's just, you know, cities are -- it's even worse in cities.  I've just gotten to the point now that I -- I wanna move out to a small town again and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  At least people ... are -- are social, you know?  There's -- I've got people on my own street that I don't even know.  You know, that don't even talk to us.  It's just weird.
L:  Yep.  And it used to be everybody knew everybody that lived on their street.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I've got people --
R:  And if you needed anything you could go to anybody.
L:  Yep.  I've got people in my apartment co- -- not my building.  I know everyone in my building, but I've got people across the street that I don't know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and people next door that I don't know and --
R:  Wow.
L:  [SIGH] [COUGH] Excuse me.  But I just don't think that they ought to -- they put too much negative stuff on the news anymore.  It just ... these trials and, you know, people killing and -- and there's not enough good stuff.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  I think they need a -- 
R:  That's true.
L:  I keep kidding my boyfriend about starting my own TV news show and just putting nothing but good stuff on. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, like -- like what Oprah's doing.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  It's true though 'cause you just get so tired of it and my husband is a avid news watcher and I would just as soon not watch it ... you know, but I end up watching it because he's watching it but he will not go a day without watching the news.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I'm just like, you know, if it's something real important, I'll hear about it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But just what you know's the same thing.  You just don't wanna hear all the negative stuff.
L:  Yep.  I usually turn it on just to watch the weather to see what the weather's gonna do.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's like today I wanted to put my tent up so I could air my tent out because --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we went camping last weekend [LAUGH] and I can't do it 'cause it's gonna rain and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I just happened to watch the rest of the news because it was on and -- but normally I'm on my computer at this time ... and today I just happened to be here watching the weather.  That's why they got through [LAUGH] to me.
R:  Oh, how funny.  Yeah, I think I've missed a lot of calls because they take so long to ... pick up.  I learned that from the last one is that you have to really answer the phone and then just wait.  And wait.  And then it finally comes on but it -- I -- I think I've hung up on 'em m- many times. [LAUGH]
L:  Me too.
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  I just wish they could give you a specific time that they're gonna call.
R:  Well, y- there's a -- actually I got a email about it the other day.  You can actually call in now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I don't remem- -- I don't have the ... I don't know if I kept it 'cause I'm just like, ah, I've only got a couple more to go anyway and ... if they call they call. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's how I just started feeling.  I mean, 'cause I -- I know I've missed some from being online.
R:  Oh --
