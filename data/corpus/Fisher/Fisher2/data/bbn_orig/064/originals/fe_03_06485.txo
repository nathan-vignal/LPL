R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Lydia.
R:  Hi, my name is Simone.
L:  Okay.
R:  I- okay.  You have any comments on that?  [inaudible] --
L:  No, you go first.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh as far as, uh ... trials and stuff is concerned?  Is that what they just said?
L:  Yes.  Yes, high --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- profile trials shown on TV etc.
R:  [NOISE] What do I feel about it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, well, I just -- I -- I really don't like it that much.  I think that certain things should be left, um -- like, so -- so people shouldn't notice -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no- know about it.  Some things should be personal with certain families and stuff, especially if they're trying to -- um, those trials on TV because I think it's just for publicity ... basically.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's a publicity thing, you know what I'm saying?  They didn't want people's names out there and s- -- a lot of things are false and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you find out after -- after you read, um, about it, um, you'll find out a lot of things that they said on TV is really not true and it actually happened another way.
L:  Yeah, I tend to agree.  I kind of feel that from anything that I've seen on TV or heard about, like, most people in the public aren't really informed as to what's going on and the proper law process and what's happening.  They only see what the media wants to pr- -- to show and they kind of choose who does or who, you know -- who believes what and who doesn't.  Um, they asked if I personally had ever watched anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess the only thing I ever really watched was maybe parts of the O.J. Simpson trial because --
R:  Who hasn't?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was in high school, and that's just what everybody did. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Who hasn't?
L:  And you had to anyway.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It was the only thing on TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I always kinda remember thinking, like, it was just very sensationalized and -- so whatever was going on and whether my opinion about what was -- who was guilty or wasn't didn't matter but the fact there are some things that people didn't wanna have exploited if they were, like, a victim or something like that.
R:  Mhm and also -- you also find out if you realize -- see, when they were putting these things on TV, like I say, it's a publicity thing.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's also to make money off of.
L:  Right.
R:  Some things are considered -- even with murders and things like that, some things I feel should be -- should stay awa- -- you know what I'm saying?  The TV should not put it, um -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- they should put it up there because of the fact that there's families involved, there's a lot of emotions involved and then they have to deal with that.  On top of that they have to deal with other people, you know what I'm saying ... 
L:  Right.
R:  -- knowing about their problems and then they have to see it on TV and they have to hear it on the radio and that's just too much for a lot of people to go through, especially in the loss of a person --
L:  Right, I agree.
R:  -- when they -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  'Cause a lot of times it's the people who are being ... a lot of times it's the people being defended or the perpetrator or something like that that gets a lot of, uh, publicity but the people who suffer are the people who are involved and don't really have a say in when they're being exploited.  I mean, like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- m- thinking about how popular Monica Lewinsky got from, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- being all over -- stuff like that when it's nobody's business --
R:  For being -- what?  For being a ho?
L:  -- what was being sa- -- [LAUGH]
R:  And there was this -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yes!
R:  And that was just wrong!  I mean, even with a -- a -- I mean, I would say -- uh, I would try to put myself in the other people's predicament.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, some things are put up there -- I think they put it up there to warn others, like, people like -- guys or -- or anyone who murdered a child or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- murdered someone period, they put that on TV to -- to warn these other [NOISE] people out there, " [inaudible] this is what is gonna happen when you get caught" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so that part I can understand.  It's like [NOISE] you know what I'm saying?  It's like one of my kids, if they do something wrong, [NOISE] you know what I'm saying, I'm going to chastise them and the other kids gonna see, "Okay, hold on.  If I do that same thing --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- this is what's gonna happen to me".  So, that's why I can understand but in some -- some cases I don't think should be publicity, you know, since --
L:  Uh, you know, until --
R:  -- out there.
L:  -- the end of a trial though, you don't know what the outcome's gonna be.  I mean, in one way you're saying, "Well, look, this is what's gonna happen to you.  You're gonna be on trial".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's like, well, maybe you'll have to be on trial but then you're not gonna get convicted so you're gonna be famous and you're gonna get off and you're, like, well, if that's what's gonna happen to me, like, not that it would make anyone choose it but it certainly doesn't deter you.
R:  Exactly, and they also find out, like, um, it was this investigator that -- that -- that's been, um, fired not so long ago.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, he's a police investigator and no telling how many [NOISE] people that they got on trial from -- you know what I'm saying, because of him.
L:  Right.
R:  And he puts false information on a police report.  [NOISE] [MN] And that's another thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  A lot of people going to trial and a lot of these trials that go into police information is false information.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  And then people --
L:  Unless you really -- 
R:  -- a lot of people --
L:  Unless you're getting the whole story.  Like, if you take the time to read up on it and certain files are made open access to the public, then you can sift through the whole thing and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pick and choose, but when they show things, they take words out of context or they'll take a scene of, like, something out of context.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, they'll try and play it, like -- you know, they'll play up somebody who, you know, just isn't very good at speaking on TV, like, I'm sure if I were on TV I'd look like an ass!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'd say things that would sound really dumb!
R:  You know -- [LAUGH] you know what they do?
L:  And I'd look ignorant, you know, hey, like, I'm an educated person --
R:  They look for the -- they look for exac- -- they look for the most uneducated looking person and they put --
L:  Right.
R:  -- them on TV so that -- [LAUGH] ask for their comments and stuff and I think that is really silly.
L:  Right, like, they'll try and show somebody as looking extremely uneducated and you're like, "Look at that loser" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, "Of course he's guilty" and you're like, okay, so he doesn't --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- have a good vocabulary but Osama on TV, like, I -- I'm on the phone with a stranger right now, so I'm like, gee, I don't know what to say so --
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I mean, I was the same way --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I [inaudible] is I -- I also wanna bring a point --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the kids that's going on trial, the children that's going on trial who are doing certain things.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] and, uh, if you read up on those things or if you ever seen a trial with a twelve year old ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a twelve year old boy or a nine year old boy going to a prison with these grown men --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's another thing I don't feel that they should do it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  That is just totally off the hook.  I mean, if that's the case they should have a certain prison for just them young boys if that's the point.  If they really did something, they did it intentionally.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It should be a certain place specifically just for their age group because putting these boys, or even these little girls, in the -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the prison with these grown men and wo- -- I mean, it really messes their head up.  There's not -- they say they're putting people away to, um, help them change or whatever but in actuality it -- it just makes them worse.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  When they get out of jail after they've been tried and convicted, they get out of jail they'll be right back in the same way or probably even crazier.
L:  Yeah, and I wonder -- I mean, I look at how much of that just from ... well, obviously from, like, being around children or if you have children, like, you have your opinions about that but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- also, like, when you see anything on TV, like, I think they're always going to try and play up the fact if there's a child on TV.  They're always going to appeal to the sense of, like, alright, you don't know the kid.  You don't know what the kid did.  You didn't have anybody murdered by this kid so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when you see on TV -- if you see some twelve year old kid, no matter what he or she did, you're like, "What the hell?  It's just a kid" like, so I mean, they -- that certainly [inaudible] --
R:  I mean, it -- it -- regardless of how you put it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- children do things and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even good people -- good people can actually make bad decisions.
L:  Right.
R:  That's a known fact.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I mean, it's also -- I don't feel it -- when it comes down to a child, you also have to look at the background and how they were raised and who was taking care of them. 
L:  Right which is --
R:  Now, it always starts in the home.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Always starts in the home and the parent knows when their child is not gonna -- uh, you know what I'm saying, straight.  That's when they should get on the chi- -- and that's another thing about [NOISE] the system nowadays by not allowing the parents to chastise their children the way they should be.  That's why they're going out there going crazy.
L:  Right.
R:  They're doing all types of stuff.  They're smoking, they're sniffing, they're doing all this and then they go to jail and end up in [inaudible] or something like that and the parents can't do anything really because, again, the system is stopping that.
L:  Right.
R:  And this is -- and that's the result, you know what I'm saying, of the [inaudible].  That's the result right there.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  By you not allowing you to chastise and -- and -- and to be a parent to your child, and letting your child, you know, see that right now kids will sit there lie on their parents and go to the system for anything, you know what I'm saying, and --
L:  Mhm, and it's a -- it's a personal thing and it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- going to trial, all that stuff, like, is never good.  It's always something bad.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Even if you didn't do anything wrong, even if you're innocent, having to go through the experience is never a good thing and it --
R:  Exac- --
L:  -- shouldn't be something open to everyone.  I was, like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I don't have kids but I'm a high school teacher.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I have plenty of kids that have gone to jail or what have you and it's been very public and you don't know what's going on and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the people -- "Oh, did you hear, like, that new mother, she hit her --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- baby" and that, and the people are like, no, it was really the -- like, you know, like, the guy didn't do it.  Like, it was really the woman, she did it, he covered.  No, he did it and then all the stuff.  It's like, of course it shows up in the paper but when stuff like that starts making it onto TV, like, if it becomes a trial, it becomes high status immediately.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Like, you're gonna -- gossip happens, you read about stuff, but by making it a trial if you, like, just by knowing it's on TV -- if I didn't hear something but I'm, like, well, if it's on TV it must be big.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, like, that's just -- I don't [inaudible] status.
R:  And then that's ne- -- that's not necessarily true.
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  Sometimes they make it into something big.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It can be a petty thing, you know what I'm saying?  
L:  Y- --
R:  And they make it to something big and -- how the publicity is.  That's all about being, you know what I'm saying, in the -- in the media.  You know, the news and stuff.  Anything that can catch the person's eye or catch a person's ear will be put on TV or will be put on the radio.
L:  Right and I think you --
R:  Just as simple as that.
L:  -- and I -- I mean, I don't know, like, all of your opinions and stuff but, like, I personally am someone who tends to distrust the media and it sounds like you kind of -- from what you've said, like, you know that there's not always the whole story.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  But I would say that the majority of the public just people turning on their TVs and watching, like, aren't as skep- --
