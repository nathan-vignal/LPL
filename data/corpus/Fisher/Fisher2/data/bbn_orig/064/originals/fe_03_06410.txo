L:  Hi, my name is Ann Reid.
R:  Hi, my name is Celeste.  It's, uh, nice to meet you.  Well, I think, uh, the question of the day is pretty easy.  I can't imagine that many people would be calm during [LAUGH] a terrorist attack.  But, um, maybe you feel differently.
L:  Actually I don't think many people would remain calm.  I think a lot of people would have a tendency to panic.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And af- -- and having gone through one myself, I -- we, uh, actually ironically live [MN] four and a half blocks away from the World Trade Center and --
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  I happened to be home, as was my husband that morning -- that dreadful morning and it was really pretty incredible.  I -- I must say this though; it's funny, you know, you're panicked but you think you're not during the moment.  That's what was really weird about the whole thing.  And afterwards, like, you know, days and weeks later, people would tell me things that I did and said, and I didn't even remember.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was very strange.  It was, like, I would say, "What do you -- what do you mean?"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But apparently they called me -- I was on the phone when the plane went over our house and I actually thought it was going to hit our house.  [MN] And apparently I screamed into the telephone, "We're going to get hit by a plane" and I remember screaming but I thought I was screaming to my husband that a plane was going to hit our apartment 'cause it sounded so weird.  I mean, it was, like, you know, a jet engine literally coming out our windows.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Obviously it wasn't that close but it just sounded like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I ran into the bedroom, which is on the north side of the apartment, and he ran out 'cause of course he had heard the same thing simultaneously.  But the interesting thing was, it wasn't until over the weekend that I spoke to this person and said, "Yeah, you were on the phone with me when this happened!"  I'm like, "What do you mean I was on the phone with you?"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I honest- -- I didn't even remember being on the telephone.  Isn't that weird?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then --
L:  I think that's normal.
R:  Yeah.  And then I apparently called the office [LAUGH] and I said, "I don't think I'm going to make it in today very easily --" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- but I'll let you know".  [LAUGH] 'Cause at the beginning you could still use telephones all over the place.  And I called my parents and my father was like, "Oh, you -- you --" he wanted me to leave, you know, the area.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible] me I said that I would and of course I didn't leave immediately.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I, you know, it was really wild.  I -- I remember packing all this stuff and, you know, I thought I was very organized.  I got some cash and some, ah, jewellery [LAUGH] and water and some antibiotics and some, you know, we put on walking shoes and so on and so forth.  And I even wet all these towels and, um, put them along -- we have a -- a group of windows that face the World Trade Center -- there's, like, a whole south wall of windows. And it's a -- it was actually a very beautiful view.  And so, I put all these towels with -- and I wet them so that -- if fact you could see obviously the debris was coming.  It was, like, obviously not good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then wet more towels and we walked out of the house after the second tower collapsed.  And then it was kind of insane, because even though I had all these towels and I had, like, a long sleeved shirt on, I somehow didn't put socks on.  Can you believe this?  And so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there I am.  I'm wearing a skirt [MN] and I have these flat walking shoes but I don't have any socks on so, the debris, you know, the dust that was on the ground -- ev- -- you know, had settled pretty quickly.  It actually looked like -- like, um, sand. It was like this golden sand --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all over where we live 'cause we're far enough away that there wasn't the big debris, it was more, you know, it was the pulverized dust.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it got on to sort of the tops of our feet and it was itchy for days.  It was terrible.  And I remember thinking, "I can't believe I thought about all these funny things".  I brought pyjamas and I brought toothbrushes and toothpaste, but I did not think to put on a pair of socks.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So -- so, you just never know.  I -- I think also at the end of the day, you don't ev- -- you may even think that when you're calm but you don't realize perhaps the internal panic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that is -- that's going on.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do because, um, I took care of my mom.  And I know this is not, you know, a situation where it was terrorism but I took care of my mom and, um, she'd had a procedure done and they brought her back up to the room and there were no nurses on the floor and my mother obviously was not in very good shape and she had -- just had bypass surgery --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and I thought she was having a heart attack and --
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  -- I ended up putting the oxygen on her; I ended up setting the level and putting the oxygen mask on her --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and also took her, um, oh, the oxygen saturation because, you know, the O two saturation should be, mm, ninety eight, ninety nine, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And she was eighty two.
R:  Really.
L:  So, that means -- yeah, that means that her brain was dying off.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  And I had nobody to help me and --
R:  I can't believe this.
L:  -- and then pulmonary --
R:  How did you know what to do?
L:  Been around that long.  Yeah, just been around my mom -- no -- yeah just been in- -- had my daughter ill and, you know, just been around, you know.
R:  Wow!
L:  And -- but then pulmonary and cardiac care wanted to fight as to who should come up and see my mother.
R:  Oh, that's incredible!
L:  It's, like, you assholes.
R:  Oh, truly.  You know, that, you know, health care is just so -- it's -- it's the most difficult problem in our country.  And it seems --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like this giant elephant in the room that nobody wants to deal with.  I mean, there was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was that one weird moment with -- with Hillary Clinton of all people and -- and um, I know that she's not very well liked but my mother's in the medical profession and she was really hoping that there was an opportunity for there to be, [SIGH] you know, better health insurance, better health care, and -- and now it's, like, nobody wants to talk about it.  [LAUGH] It's --
L:  Mhm.  Well, I'm sorry, I don't know how you feel about Bush, but Bush got in and, hey, that blew it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  Well, he's not -- I'm not a fan of his I'll have to say.  And I particularly was thinking the other day -- I mean, speaking of terrorism, I know that he purports to be, you know, the president on terrorism, but the fact of the matter is, we just spend a hundred billion dollars on a war where -- okay, I'm glad we won, and it -- that was kind of a given in my opinion with, you know, it was just so overwhelmingly obvious that we would win pretty easily.  But, um, the thing that bothers me is that, you know, we have, um, another raised alert as of yesterday and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, living in New York City, it's, you know, it's a difficult time for New York City.  The economy's very poor here.  There are services being cut left, right and center; people being fired, here's your unemployment.  And yet the city needs to pay every day, something in the range of, I think it's six hundred thousand dollars for additional, um, you know, [MN] round the clock, uh, terrorist --
L:  Security.
R:  -- security.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the fact of the matter is -- is the federal government isn't paying for it, and the city has to come up with the money -- I don't know how.  And I just feel like it's incredible that we spend all this money on other things; billions and billions of dollars, but we don't spend it on protecting ourselves.  We don't spend it on healthcare.  We don't spend it on education.  And it's, you know, it's -- it's an intractable problem.  I -- I mean, it -- everybody talks about it but it seems unworkable.  And at the same time, Bush has this incredible approval rating.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's just enormous.  I feel that he's frankly a shoe in for the next election and --
L:  I hope like -- 
R:  -- it's depressing. [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, yeah, I hope like hell he isn't.  We got hit by a, um, government run, uh, bus line transportation, you know, um, and we got hit by a bus about two years ago.  And we can't even get the medical care we need and --
R:  Oh, no!  So sorry.
L:  -- we're going -- we're go- -- yeah, we're go- -- I'm going to be, like, so many thousand dollars in the hole after the whole thing's settled, because there's a law that says they only have to pay so much because it's government.
R:  Well, you know, that's kinda like this whole thing where I read recently where you can virtually not even be able to sue the government.  This sort of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's sort of impervious or something, which --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I -- it really stuns me.
L:  Yes.  It is.
R:  Yeah.  And then did you hear that Kristy Tar Whitman quit yesterday?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I wonder wh -- --
L:  No.
R:  -- though I'm surprised she lasted as long as she did to be perfectly honest.  And, um ...
L:  Yeah.  I can understand why she quit though.
R:  It's sad because, you know, here was somebody who was, you know, a thinker and not being partisan or not partisan, she was really trying to do the best job possible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And completely being stymied and isolated and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pressured, um, and it was -- it was just -- it's terrible.  She's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, a very bright woman.  A friend of a friend of mine knows her and she works incredibly hard and, you know, it's almost like she's hurt her political career within the republican -- and she's one of the good republicans.  And it just really bothers me that they don't treasure somebody who's willing to work hard.
L:  Yeah.  Actually I know a little bit about her because I have read about her because she has been in politics for a few years, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, what I've read about her, you know, yes, she is republican, but like you said, she's one of the republicans I think honestly wants to make a difference and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- is not pro -- is not pro big business.
R:  She's just not party line.  She's willing to make her own decisions and, yeah, I think you have to respect anybody who's willing to do that.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, it just made me very sad.  And you know, I was surprised she didn't quit before actually.  But it's terrible for her because now what does she do?  You know, she used to be touted as somebody who might be a vice presidential candidate, but I think -- I think after this, I don't really even see how that's possible.
L:  Um, maybe --
R:  Hard to say.
L:  -- maybe somebody will come along and, you know, run for the presidency and recognize her --
