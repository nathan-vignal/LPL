L:  Hello.  My name is Tracey.  I am thirty two, uh ... black female from St. Lois, Missouri.
R:  Well, hi, I'm Dana Hobson and I'm from Tyler[?], Texas, and I'm forty seven.
L:  Okay.  
R:  How are you tonight?
L:  I'm good.  How're you?
R:  Good, good.
L:  Good.  Good, nice to talk to you.
R:  Yeah, thanks.
L:  Do they tell us when to start or do we just start?
R:  Yeah, I think we just -- we just start talking.
L:  Okay.
R:  And now were did you say you were from?  St. Lois?
L:  St. Lois, yes.
R:  St Lois, oh, okay.  All right.  Well --
L:  I think that if a terrorist attack happened here, locally, that there would be a massive panic ... and that a lot of people would probably suffer, uh ... just from lack of knowledge and information.  I wouldn't even know where to go.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think we would either.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I mean, I'm ... fairly young, I'm thirty two, and so I've never ...
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- really been involved in a -- you know, real war or real combat where --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a lot of Americans were injured.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.  I might have a ... different idea about ... what would happen in a real war.  I'm not -- I -- I just think it would be mass panic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my best friend lived -- she lives in New York and when, uh, nine eleven happened, she was seven months pregnant and had --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to walk, like fifty blocks.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  It was horrible.  I was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- calling her all day long and, you know, just couldn't get through on the lines 'cause everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was pretty much shut down.
R:  Yeah, wow, that's scary.
L:  Yeah, she just said there were like, you know, just a sea of people just, you know, walking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you jus- -- everything was shut down in the city and that -- you know how busy New York ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- is, at least on TV.
R:  Right.  Well, I'm just --
L:  But it's like that in real life.
R:  Yeah, well, I'm -- I'm just kinda wondering now since they have moved it to high alert what we may be, you know, facing because I don't think it's over.  You know, they're still gonna pick a time when we're least expecting it to try to attack again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think we're on -- kinda been more on top of things because we've been able to, you know, to get some of the ones that are -- that are terrorizing ... but you know, you can't get 'em all and they're still gonna be able to -- to do things and we're just still sitting pretty, I think.
L:  Right.  I think that, um, a lot of us are just kind of ... uninformed, um, because they tell us to go on about our daily lives and you know, act normal.  Um, and I just -- I can't imagine if something major happened.  I mean, even not here in St. Lois but if something happened, like, in Chicago or Memphis or ... I just -- uh, I just -- I don't know how Americans could really handle it being here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, on our ... territory; on our land.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're not like, uh, Afghanist- uh, the +Afghanistani's.  Um, they're used to ... and I don't know if you can really get used to it but ... it's --
R:  Well, it's just more of a common --
L:  -- part of their lives.
R:  Yeah, it's more common and they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they -- they don't really deal with it but they -- they kinda have to in some respect because it's something that happens, even --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in Israel, you know?  I mean, even the things that go on it's just ... you know, we're blessed as, you know, Americans, it -- that we don't have to deal with that like they do but it's --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- it is a scary, scary thought.  I jus- -- I just feel like, you know, that there's gonna be another day of it.  It ... you know, unless the Lord protects us somehow.  I think it's -- it's gonna -- it's brewing, it's gonna happen again and they're gonna just wait until we're ... you know, not thinking about it anymore.  So, when they put us on high alert, I think that kinda ... takes away from their excitement of doing something, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I hope -- you know, I was thinking of trying to -- trying to think of a time that they would think that we were least expecting it, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... but after nine eleven it's -- this -- it could be any time, anywhere.  I --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I think I'm safe here in east Texas because I'm not in New York or not in LA or, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But if that's what they think we're expecting, they would come near going around to places, smaller areas.  I don't ... you know, I don't think they'd come here [LAUGH] but you never know.  You know the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- those suicide bombers, they just put those things on 'em and just go wherever they want to and blow themselves up, you know, and it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kills people with them so who's to say the couldn't just ... you know, go anywhere and do that.
L:  Right, it's -- it's very scary because you ... you don't know.  I mean, the people who boarded, you know, these planes on nine eleven ... had absolutely no idea that that was gonna be, you know, that that was gonna actually happen.  I'm su- -- they were completely clueless when they woke up that morning so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, it can happen to anyone, all of us.  Um, I just ... hope, um, I haven't been watching the news as much lately as I had been when the war first started.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It kind of became very redundant and ... I don't know, it just seems so almost unbelievable that in two thousand and three that we have to ... uh ... resort back to physical battling.  It just ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it, uh, and I know it just seems so ... old and ancient and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it would seem like people would know that ... we don't want anyone to die.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But I don't have, you know, family members or, you know, brothers or sisters that, you know, are in the military at all.
R:  Yeah, you don't.  Well, I have a nephew.  He's, uh, twenty years old and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh -- but he's in North Carolina.  He was in Germany for about, oh, a year and a half or so and, uh -- so he came back but he didn't get deployed out of his group that came back to the States, uh.  Out of eighty, there were only three that got to stay and he was one of 'em.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, so we were ... you know, we'd be sitting praying, you know, if the Lord could ... help that situation and -- and it -- it did.  He said he could still go but, you know, it -- it got -- it was over so fast so --
L:  Right. 
R:  It -- it didn't en- entail a lot.  We had, uh, several people -- one guy in our church, he's in the reserves and he's in -- in his mid thirties and they just kept thinking he was gonna go.  He was on standby and, uh, one of my best friends husband's on standby and they both were in the navy so, you know, but it never came to that because they didn't need 'em but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they were -- they were thinking they had to go through the motions like they were going to be taken and ... but, you know, I just have to ... you know, put faith in the President too that he knows -- he knows more about all the stuff that's going on than we do, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  They're not gonna tell us everything so --
L:  Right.
R:  But it is, you know, when you think about being one of yours, just like I have ... two of my children are boys and they're in college.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've -- you know, I thought how would I feel the minute they start talking about war, how would I feel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if mine had to go, you know?  Uh, just -- oh!  Even though I know they'd be proud to -- to, um, you know, be an American and go over and fight but nobody wants to but there's been war ever since the beginning of time.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that ... way.  I mean, just in the beginning it -- it's always been that way and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's just a shame, like you said, as -- as it's gotten, um -- you know, to our generation now that you still have to resort to that but, you know, these people, they -- they don't care.  They're just -- they just wanna kill, you know?
L:  Right, I know.
R:  They could care less if we like it or if we don't like it.  They're ju- --
L:  Which is very scary.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  'Cause they're almost like ticking time bombs and, I mean, they're killing themselves, killing, you know, their own countrymen.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  It's just very ... um, you know, it's -- it's so different and nothing that we're really used to.  I mean, it has happened, um, Waco and, uh, the Oklahoma city bombing.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it does happen here in America, but I -- I don't know.  It's just so ... it's so sad and I just pray and hope that it ... will never come to a point where, um ... where, um, here in America it's like it is over in Afghanistan --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Israel where they're just, you know, constantly in a battle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- over territory.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It just ... and religion and ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it --
R:  Well, it's -- the way I look at it I think it's just a lot of it's getting closer to the end time, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's just the -- you know, from the biblical standpoint there's gonna -- you know, Israel still the reason we're blessed is because we stick up for Israel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And everybody else is -- you know, they're gonna come against Israel and to Israel, God's chosen people.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's -- it's gonna be that way no matter, you know, what -- what anybody says and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm just so ... glad that we still support Israel because you know, that we still are blessed because of that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's -- you know, time goes on, it's -- it's just -- I think it all -- everything that's happened is just getting closer and closer to end time.  You start reading the -- you know, prophecy and everything biblically --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- and it's all come into play. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  We -- we've been studying in, uh, Sandy school, Daniel for several years and, um, then we're -- uh, starting in Revelation now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how we've been picking up on the things and it's ... you know, we're just -- we just know what's coming and, you know, it may be a long time coming but at least we know -- we know the outcome anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] We know where we're gonna -- where we're gonna fit in later on but it's -- still, it -- it is -- it's scary and I'm just -- you know, I'm glad I'm not over there and wasn't raised over there 'cause that's -- that's their homeland.
L:  Right.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And they're fighting, I guess, for what they believe in and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  So are we but the -- the -- just the -- I just hate for people to have to die --
