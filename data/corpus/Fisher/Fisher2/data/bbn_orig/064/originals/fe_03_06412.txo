L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Susan.
L:  My name's Dawn.
R:  Hi Dawn, how are ya?
L:  Good.  And yourself?
R:  Good thanks.
L:  Good.
R:  So, we're supposed to be talking about terrorism?
L:  I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Um, would you like to go first?  Or would you like me to go first?
L:  You can go first.  That'll be fine.
R:  Uh, my sense is if we had a terrorist attack or -- oh, by the way, where are you from?
L:  I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah, me too.  I'm Philly. 
L:  Okay, I'm in, um, [MN] excuse me, Bloomsburg. 
R:  Okay, uh-huh.  And, uh, my guess is if we had a terrorist attack in Philly, which probably is more likely than Bloomsburg --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think people would panic.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think there would be major panic -- I -- and -- and I guess it depends upon the nature of the type of attack, you know, was it chemical?  Was it biological?  Was it a bomb?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that would -- that would make a difference, you know, for --
L:   Well, see now, we have the power plants down here.
R:  Argh.
L:  And when they called for the terroristic stuff everybody around here panicked, um --
R:  What did they do?
L:  They were flipping -- I know a couple of my neighbors went out and bought plastic 'cause they were telling us to put plastic over our windows.
R:  Oh.  Yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  They went out and they got the plastic for the windows, uh, th- -- I know one man went out and bought a new screen door, one of those, um, the double screens, ah, storm doors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He went out and bought one of them.  Uh, it was pretty scary.  I -- we only live, like, two minutes away from it.
R:  Is it a nuclear power plant?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, gotcha.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, boy, as if screen doors are going to make a difference!
L:  Well, they say that the plastic will keep it from seeping through.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's --
L:  I don't believe it.
R:  I [LAUGH] don't buy it either.
L:  [LAUGH] Sorry, I don't buy it.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't buy it either.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH] It's -- it -- it is scary and I know I'd panic and I know my neighbors would.
R:  I think it would really depend, for me, I think it would depend upon how close it was to me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And like I said, the nature.  Like, if -- if it was like a World Trade Center kind of thing, like they -- if they bombed one of the big buildings downtown in Philly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ooh, [SIGH] [NOISE] I -- I live about eight miles from downtown and I think -- I don't think I would panic and that may sound odd.  I don't think I would panic if I were not right in the vicinity.
L:  Right.
R:  I think I'd feel -- I think I'd feel as if [PAUSE] ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're not going to get the better of us.  You know, we gotta show resolve.  We gotta be strong.  Uh, I think [NOISE] I'd want to do what I could do to help --
L:  I think the more people that panic is just making it worse for everybody.
R:  Well, no question.  An- and that being said though, I think if it was [LAUGH] like, a biological agent like anthrax --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I had reason to believe it was in my neighbourhood -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God, yeah.
R:  -- I don't know that I'd be able to hold it together.
L:  I don't think I would but for my children I would have to.
R:  Ah.
L:  'Cause I have two small children.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:   So, for my kids I would have to but I think being by myself, you know, with my husband, I think I'd show my [LAUGH] fear.
R:  Right.
L:  But with my kids around, I can't show my fear because then that's just showing 'em to be, you know what I mean, not to stand up --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and I don't want them to feel that way.
R:  That's the nice thing kids do for us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Help bring out our strength.  Yeah.  
L:  But --
R:  I mean, do you -- do you think you're husband would be able to be cool? [NOISE] Then do you think your cu- husband would have to feel like he'd be cool for you?
L:  Now, see, that's --
R:  Beside the kids?
L:  -- that's a -- that's a subject in itself.  My husband was shot in the eye two years ago,
R:  Oh.  Oh my!
L:  So, ever since he was shot --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- everything just went downhill.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, he doesn't really, [PAUSE] you know, what I mean?  I don't -- I don't know.  I know when this first started he was, like, "Oh, who cares?" you know.  But he was military; he's still military.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  He's like, you know, y- -- he -- he just, like, I don't know, he was weird.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  So, you don't know how -- how he'd react?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- and that bothers me not knowing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just thinking that he'd just, like, let it go because of who he is and what happened to him.
R:  Meaning like not resist?  Or -- or fall apart?
L:  I don't think he'd fall apart honestly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because so much has happened to him.
R:  Right.
L:  And this is just -- to him this would be petty too.
R:  Wow!
L:  And that -- and that's sad to say.  But I guess after being shot in the eye and blinded, I guess everybody would have a different [MN] intakes or whatever you want to say about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's just different from everybody I guess, I don't know.
R:  Wow!  Yeah.  I, uh, for me, you know, I -- I know what I'd like to do.  I would -- I would like to be able to have composure and grace in the situation [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would really like to be able to do that.  But I -- I don't know that I would.  Part- partly, I mean, for me I think [SIGH] your level of safe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- spiritual, religious, whatever, probably has some kind of impact or maybe the amount you've though about death --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or devout- you know, what happens when you die, might make a difference.  Or the amount you've  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe even given this thought --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because at my best moments I think well, our bodies aren't what it's all about anyway --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, our spirit is what's really important --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and don't get all scared about what's going to happen to your body, just try and do the best you can in the situation.  But that's [LAUGH] again not to say --
L:  [NOISE] Everybody, and -- and see, but the thing is, is everybody thinks different from us.
R:  That's right.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] You know --
R:  Everyone's got their --
L:  -- some people think that, you know, hey, if they're going to go, God's going to take 'em when he wants 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  And then some people [NOISE] have other take on that.
R:  Sure.
L:  You know, there -- there's your so called [LAUGH] w- -- the meaner people [NOISE] who think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that there is no God, da de da de da.  We get --
R:  I think -- 
L:  -- a lot of those mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ones around here.
R:  Yeah, I think that would be a tougher way to go.  I think if you didn't have a sense that there is more than this life --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it -- it's got to be harder --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to face the idea of losing it.
L:  I believe ya.  Ah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I feel sort of blessed that, you know, [NOISE] that's it -- that's the way if feels like to me.  And again, this is a -- this is a benefit but -- but I -- there was a point [NOISE] when I did.  Thee was a point in my life when I did and I probably would of, [NOISE] I don't know.  [NOISE] I'm walking upstairs because that other line is ringing and I don't want to disturb us.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah ...
L:  Can I ask one question?
R:  Sure.
L:  How long have you done this?
R:  This is my first time.
L:  Oh, is it really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  [PAUSE] This is my third.
R:  Oh, cool!  Cool!
L:  Well, I was just wondering if you got paid for it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I think they say that it, uh -- that it takes, like, we can take four to eight weeks to get money.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I think that's what they said.  Yeah.
L:  Mm-kay.
R:  Penn's[?] a reputable place, I -- I trust 'em.  So ...
L:  I've -- I've just have -- what -- I've done one in January, one last month and I just did one this month.  I've been in and out.
R:  Mhm.  It mayb- -- yeah maybe at the end of the time that they do it but, um, [MN] what was that -- what was I thinking?  What d- -- what do you think -- how do you think panic -- what do you think panic would look like?  If -- if a terrorist attack took place?
L:  Crazy.
R:  Like what?
L:  I think if we honestly had a real terroristic attack out here, I believe in my heart that the place would go to shambles.
R:  Like, what do you think people would do?
L:  Start running, go berserk, uh, act silly, +literally lit- -- excuse me, literally.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just like, well, we're known for tornadoes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in Pennsylvania.
R:  I didn't know that! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We have a lo- -- we supp- -- well, I know we've had quite a few here.
R:  Okay.
L:  And as soon as they call tornado on the, uh, radio or on the TV, the stores are packed.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I think along that same line because a terroristic attack would be worse.
R:  Right.
L:  I think down he- -- well, I'm my area ... I think it would be a lot worse honestly.
R:  Mhm.  Do you think people would do things like loot?  Or harm other people [PAUSE] for their own benefit?
L:  It just depe- -- I -- it depends on where you are.
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, if they believe that they'll get away with it I -- I believe that they would.
R:  Hm.
L:  A lot of people have no ... how do you say it -- have no morals.
R:  Right.
L:  And I know there's a lot down here that they do not have morals, that's for sure.
R:  Hm.
L:  And I believe some people around here would loot.  I believe they would try hurting others ... storing their loot.  Yeah, I -- if there was a terrorist attack, yes I a- -- I do believe that hard -- very, very believable.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Do you think it would be di- -- see in New York, you know, I thought it was actually real impressive, what people did.
L:  There was no looting.
R:  There wasn't.  People --
L:  No.
R:  -- really came out and helped one anoth- -- I mean, people ran away initially, which is just common sense, you know, running away from, you know, like, buildings collapsing on you.  But it was amazing the amount of kindness and courage and compassion and, you know, like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- where the blood banks, th- they -- they -- people were waiting in line for hours and hours and hours to be able to donate blood and people were making food for other people down in the area and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, I think -- I think there's something maybe, um, I thought that was really a beautiful thing that people --
L:  That was.
R:  -- um --
L:  They sent us all cards for people that they knew died in the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in that thing, yes.
R:  Yeah.  So, I mean, maybe -- maybe something like that would take place where we'd say, you know, we're going to take care of each other.
L:  Honestly, that would be really nice because --
R:  Wouldn't that be a beautiful thing?
L:  Yes.  And I tell you I lost three people over at the, uh, World --
