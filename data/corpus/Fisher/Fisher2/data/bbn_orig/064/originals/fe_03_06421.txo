L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Carol.
R:  Hi, my name is Julie.
L:  Hi.  This is my first time so I don't know exactly how this goes.
R:  It's my first time too so ... [LAUGH]
L:  So, I guess we just talk about it or ...
R:  Yeah, I guess so.
L:  Um, 'cause it's -- I think the question was I guess during a terrorist attack would we be panicked?  Or stay calm?  And I -- I would say def- -- probably definitely panic.  Um --
R:  Well, yeah.   [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, I'm -- I'm thinking that isn't, like, watching from a television but if you're, like, you know, after a place where the terrorists pl- -- is taking effect.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  I guess so.
L:  Okay.
R:  Because if I was watching from TV I'd probably, you know, I wouldn't be like --
L:  'Cause when I -- when I initially saw the nine eleven here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I was -- 'cause right now I'm in New York.  Are you in New York?
R:  Um, actually I'm in Utah.
L:  Oh, you're in Utah.  Oh, nice.  [MN] I've been to Utah twice.  It's actually very nice, nice and peaceful.  Spacey.
R:  Oh, okay, thanks.
L:  Um, when I was -- when the nine eleven struck I was in California, so I actually ended up seeing it from, um, television.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I would say it was more of a awe but I wasn't -- I wasn't exactly in panic, you know, panic attack 'cause it wasn't happening in my state.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [PAUSE] I guess I -- I thought that repercussions could be a war --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and so, maybe that would, you know, cause me the panic later but it didn't really occur to me to panic.  And now I'm in New York, you know, and had it happened I would have been panicked.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I would have thought so.
L:  'Cause the thing about -- the thing about Manhattan is -- if you're familiar with the area it's like a island -- it's a little island.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You have rivers on both sides and technically when the nine eleven happened they shut down all the bridges.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I think I heard that.
L:  So you couldn't get out or in.  Technically you're trapped inside.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, I guess, you know, if that was the case with me I would have definitely panicked.  Um, I don't know.  I -- I guess we talk about this for about ten minutes?
R:  I guess so.  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- yeah.  I guess -- well, for me, yeah if had been there I'm pretty sure I would have panicked.  [LAUGH] But, yeah as it was I did see it from TV and I was in Utah, which was pretty much across the country.
L:  Right.
R:  I wasn't, like, way freaked out or anything.  I think I [PAUSE] sorry, um, --
L:  That's okay.
R:  -- the biggest thing I guess was -- well for one thing, my dad was out of town.  He was in Boston and I didn't know if he'd ever [LAUGH] be able to come home for a while because I knew that they weren't going to -- of any or- -- airports open or anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I just kinds worried about that.  And -- but for the most part I think I was just kind of in shock.  Like, it was hard to comprehend that that had happened, especially because I wasn't really there and I was just seeing it on TV and --
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- yeah.  So, I don't know.  It was kinda scary though.
L:  It -- it was interesting when it happened because I was supposed to fly out, um, from California I was supposed to move out, and I ended up coming here on the fifteenth of September, which was about four days after the attack.
R:  Wow!
L:  Which was morning that the LAX and LaGuardia opened because I flew into LaGuardia.  And I remember all my friends calling me -- this -- I found out because I -- I got called at, like, six in the morning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um about, you know, the World Trade Center attack.  And people were calling my house to make sure -- to wonder if I was still here or if I had left.
R:  Wow!  Yeah.  I would call -- I would have called you too.
L:  And -- and one of my friends -- I remember my friend calling me up and I was sleeping, and she said, you know, "Oh, my Gosh, the World -- you know, the World Trade Center -- there's an attack".  And I was, like, "Yeah, there was.  There was one, like, back in ninety six or, I don't know it was -- it was a while ago" and she then goes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "No, no, no, it got hit again" and I'm, like, "Oh, okay" and then she was -- and -- and she was panicked because she was, like, "The Pentagon's gone".  I'm going --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- "Oh, the Pentagon got hit" but she said, "The Pentagon" you know, she was, "Go turn on your TV".  And so that's when I had to go to turn it on, and then I -- and I was slightly worried because I realized, you know, four days I'm flying out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'm not flying out there to visit, but I'm actually flying out thee to move.  And I had a job that was, um, in the downtown area that I was hired by.
R:  Oh.
L:  But when I came here I had -- I couldn't contact them.  I mean, um, first of there was no connections, everybody just kind of left.  Um, the company that I was supposed to work for flew -- they fled to Chicago and they couldn't find the, [MN] you know, the person who had hired me. [PAUSE] So, um --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- it was actually kind of crazy, I mean, everyone told me to stay.  I probably should have listened, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and stayed.  But when I came here it was, like, really chaotic.  I couldn't even get in, you know, go past a certain point in Manhattan -- couldn't really go downtown.  You could actually smell, like, the chemicals and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, [MN] fairly nauseating.  I think it made it really personal though, once I moved here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause then I, uh, because at the time it's, like, you know, there could be a war.  There could be other things going on.  I didn't know, you know, what wo- what would happen, if there was going to be another attack or not.  So, I was kind of in panic mode I think once I got here, which was funny.  Because it was -- I was in panic mode, like, two weeks later.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And then first -- the first time it was, like, wow that's really sad but, you know, because it -- I'm so far away from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I know LA was -- LAX was also under, um, I -- I guess potential attack but that didn't --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.
L:  -- happen.  So, but I was so far from LA because I was -- I live in, um -- for another think the whole family are in Orange County -- it's, like, Newport beach area?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's, like, a good thirty miles south of LA, so it was, like, okay, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the only thing that'll probably hit me if something happened there is, like, radiation or something.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I was not, like, too, too, worried.  Um, does this thing hang up, like, after ten minutes?  Is it, like, [several inaudible words] clicks?
R:  Yeah, I think it cuts it off.
L:  Just cuts it off?  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  So ...
L:  -- I don't really know what to say with terrorists because it -- everyone's been talking about it here.
R:  I know.
L:  And, um, [PAUSE] I don't know, it's -- [PAUSE] I know they're talking about another attack.  I know security here's really high, about five in the subway system and theres, like, you know, policemen and, um, the military, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you're in Utah. That's nice.
R:  Yeah.  Even though -- actually now that I think of it, we were kind of worried a little bit too, which is actually kinda dumb, 'cause I mean with in Utah.  But because the Olympics were coming that winter some people were worried that, like, they would try to attack --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, Utah too.  But I was kinda doubtful about that 'cause there's, like, well, you know, they could but, you know.  And during the Olympics we were worried about that actually more -- just the terrorists -- terrorists would try to come 'cause there were so many people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- coming into Utah to see the Olympics and everything.  So, yeah, but we were okay.  [LAUGH] I think a lot of people left though for that reason.  I remember the roads were really clear.  We thought they'd be all blocked up with tons of people but --
L:  They -- it was fairly clear. 
R:  -- everyone left because they didn't want to be there or something,
L:  Right.  [PAUSE] Yeah.  [PAUSE] So do you think there's going to be another attack?
R:  Um, I really don't know.  Um, I guess if there is, I'll be just as surprised as I was the first time.  But probably not as surprised, you know, obviously because --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- it did happen before.  Huh?
L:  'Cause it -- 'cause the war?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, the war's going on.  That's, w- -- you know, right now as well.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, I hope, you know, I really hope there isn't like another attack --
R:  Well, yeah, [LAUGH] obviously I mean, I hope not. 
L:  -- but I'm not sure if New York would be a target again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, just because there so much high sec- -- and their security [inaudible] think really help --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but because there's so much concentration of, you know, helping New York I -- they might just end up striking somewhere else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I don't know.  Now it's very personal now that I live here, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and it must have been frightening for the people that happen.  I had friends who wee out here who, you know, couldn't -- I couldn't get through to my friends I had [several inaudible words] calling.  All the cellphones were down and that their network was busy.
R:  Wow!
L:  And, you know, they -- the -- my friends -- because they worked, like, in midtown Manhattan, they weren't downtown --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were fine but they were just stuck within the city.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and, you know, they said it was really scary.  [PAUSE] [MN] So --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [inaudible] I guess, you know, when they saw on TV it was definitely not something you see every day.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] It took me a while to even figure out what was happening.
L:  Oh, see when they crumbled down.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think there was some slight panic.  I mean, I [MN] I remembered for the two days afterwards, I was absolutely glued to TV because all they aired --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I was actually glued to the TV 'cause I was --
R:  Oh, so was I.  I mean, I never watch TV.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- thinking -- 'cause I was still thinking oh, no 'cause I'm going to be flying there.  What's going to hap- -- you know, what's going to happen?  The airport's shut down.  And then when I went there, it was a Saturday, it was the fifteenth of September two -- like, two thousand and one was a Saturday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They asked me to arrive -- my flight left at one twenty in the afternoon -- one twenty P.M.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They asked me to arrive at six thirty in the morning.
R:  Wow!
L:  And I was there for about seven hours and I got my baggage checked I would say, like, you know, twenty times it was -- I was just -- with tons of people -- everything got checked.  And because I was moving there I had, like, my phone in there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and a few things that -- and they were checking everything, like, "Why are you taking your phone?"  And I'm, like,  "Well, I'm moving" --
R:  Yeah, no kidding.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and the first -- and the first thing I really need, you know, when I get my apartment is a phone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I guess I had odd things in there as opposed to someone, you know, who's just traveling.  So, I got massively checked.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Umm --
R:  That would be really hard 'cause, um, --
L:  Yeah.  And it wasn't like I planned this, you know, right when that happened, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- I had bought, you know, I had bought the ticket back in, like, July.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I really wasn't planning on changing it.
R:  That's crazy 'cause, I mean, obviously if you're moving you have to take everything with you.
L:  Right.  And then you --
R:  I remember I went on vacation in the summer and I was a -- I couldn't even take a nail file with me 'cause I -- I, you know, I always have stuff like that --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- to fix my nails 'cause they grow so fast.  So --
