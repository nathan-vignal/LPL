R:  I'm Brian.
L:  Hi, I'm Kelly. [PAUSE]  Did you wanna start or ...?
R:  Oh, ah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  I -- I forget that they, ah, they just let you go.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Have I ever watched televised trial?  You know what, every once and a while I -- I just, like, kinda, have popped --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into Court TV.  I think the only time I've really gotten into it was -- obviously, the O.J. was the big one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, there are times when I wish I had time to sit down, during the day, and watch certain trials.  Because there are some that I would be fascinated by.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Menendezes would -- would have been one that I would have liked to have watched.  Um, gosh, there -- there -- I mean, it -- local ones, too.  I think, you know, sometimes -- I dunno where you're from, but I'm -- I'm from the Philadelphia area and there's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there was a trial last year, or actually earlier this year, with a rabbi that was convic- -- that was accused of master minding the -- the killing of his wife.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, I knew some people that were, kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- peripherally involved in the case.  I would have loved to just watched it.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Because he's a twisted, sick individual.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it -- it would have been great to watch it.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, if you knew people, [LAUGH] like you said.
R:  Ye- yeah.
L:  Well, I live in Madison, Wisconsin, or a little town near Madison.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so I haven't really, ah, known of any big ones that have -- have been from around here.  But, um --
R:  Well, Geoffrey Dahmer was --
L:  Well, yeah, that's true.
R:  -- Milwaukee.
L:  We -- we do have the serial [LAUGH] killer --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- +connection.  Him and Ed Geene was from around here too.
R:  Always read about him.
L:  That's true.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] like you said, I too, watched -- the biggest one I watched was O.J.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, that one I found fascinating to watch too.  And I guess I don't see any problem with televising them, um, I guess as far as their rights go or whatever, I -- I just don't really see that as a -- as an issue.  I think, um, it's -- it's for public, um, knowledge and -- and public record so, um, I -- like you, I just kinda flip in and out to Court TV and -- and sometimes catch little pieces of it.  I don't have time, really, to sit down and watch a whole case and sometimes, you know, even if you just flip it on, it just has, um, you're stuck up -- you're caught up in the details and that kinda thing and it can get kinda monotonous.  But, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I -- I really don't have a problem, one way or the other watching it or -- or having it televised, I guess.
R:  I fall victim to watching, like, well -- one of my favorite shows is The Practice.  
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  And, but the -- the thing about it is, I mean, that you're -- you're looking at very small pieces of what a normal trial would be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, a couple of pieces of testimony, maybe the closing argument and then the verdict.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, it's not like the typical --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- trial that, in real life, where it would take maybe days or weeks --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Instead, you're seeing about maybe fifteen minutes at the most --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of any particular trial --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- which, it would be hard -- I think if -- to -- for the general public to see real life trials that way --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as highlights, would probably be not fair.
L:  Right.
R:  And I know that the attorneys and the -- and the legal community believe that televising certain trials may lead to unfair perceptions of the general public of the defendant, if the defendant turns to be not guilty.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And that -- that may be true.  I mean if I were sitting in -- if I were accused of killing, ah, my girlfriend or my wife, whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] And that was shown on television and, even though -- maybe the evidence is circumstantial, too many people will formulate the opinion based upon either what they've read or what they see.
L:  Right.
R:  And, for the individual who truly might be innocent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how much are they harmed after the fact by having been that publicly exposed?
L:  Well, that's true.  That is true.  I mean, if you take, like, the Laci Petersen case --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for example.  Um, you know, where he'd be able to get a trial that, um, people hadn't heard about it or already formed an opinion, I don't -- I don't know if that would even be possible for him.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that one has been so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- broadcast and -- and pretty much, you know, the media's pretty much found him guilty and everything else so, um, yeah, that -- in that case, there or in any  -- in any case like that, where, you know, people have -- have formed such strong opinions based on all the media coverage, um, yeah, I guess the -- the fairness issue really, um, is a concern.  And, um, [PAUSE] on that case I -- I don't know.  I guess it's -- it's not that fair but, you know, still fascinating [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
L:  -- and if that one were on Court TV I'd probably be [LAUGH] tuned into it.
R:  Oh, I'd absolutely watch that one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because he's -- I mean, the -- the -- the twists and turns that that story is taking right now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would only serve to make it more fascinating in real life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to see if this guy is really as wacky as they -- I mean, this whole thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about the satanic cult took her and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, [SIGH] granted, I got to give him credit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for having a spirited, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- albeit, what I -- I think most people would consider, desperate defence.
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.
R:  Um, but, you know, it -- it -- I guess you've got to do something if -- you've gotta fight it somehow 'cause everybody's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- perception now, with the girlfriend, the ex girlfriend testifying against him, is that he's not a very nice guy.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So.  And, I guess if you -- if you have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every trial on television, then, and it -- and then you have an appeal after the fact, because everybody has the right to appeal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how damaging can that be to an appeal if everybody's watched it on television?  Well, now, how can you possibly appeal because it really would be difficult to find a jury of people that hadn't seen it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Unless they were on the Jerry Springer Show, I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] But, ah, but even they watch TV, of course, they only watch Springer, but ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, that's a -- a whole different group. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's -- it seems to be that's what juries are made up of these days is people who are -- it's -- it's hard for -- like, for -- you're right.  The Petersen trial.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  How are you possibly going to get twelve people that don't know anything about a case or -- or about the case or, even though they may know a little bit about it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can really divorce themselves from any pri- preconceived notions.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You almost have to be brain dead.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, unfortunately, seems like a lots of juries are like that.
L:  Mhm.  Well, okay, you know, for -- for the O.J. Simpson trial, I mean, who wasn't shocked with that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- outcome.
R:  Oh.
L:  That was, you know, that was such a huge shock.  Where I was -- at the time I was pregnant with my first child and I just [LAUGH] remember it was --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- it was, like, the biggest thing I remember, next to my -- is -- I was -- I was due right when the verdict came out and I just [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, was it re- -- were you really?
L:  Yeah, I just --
R:  I was afraid they didn't induce, at that point.
L:  -- everybody was so shocked.  Oh, I know.  I know.  You know, it's one of those things where I think you always remember where you were, or when you heard it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it was such a huge story and -- and such a huge thing and it was just so shocking and you just have to wonder, you know, what was going with that jury, and, you know.
R:  Yeah.  There were so many -- so many people that just were polarized by that whole thing.
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  You know, it's a se- -- it's a shame that it had to come down that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, it didn't have to.  
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah.
R:  I -- I -- I just think that it was poorly handled and, you know, now, gee, I guess he's still out there searching for the real killer.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I'm sure --
R:  Probably doesn't own any --
L:  -- when he's not on the golf course, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Well, he doesn't own any mirrors, obviously.  Because I -- I'd love to say, "O.J., I -- I found the real killer.  Look in the mirror!"
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.  
R:  Of course, he's bigger than me, he'd probably kill me but that -- you know --
L:  Yeah, I think I'd stay away from him [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't -- I don't want to be anywhere near especially with his road rage, you know, he -- he's just --
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  -- he keeps -- he just keeps getting in trouble but he's not the -- well, any -- anyway that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I know too much about O.J. in real life, he's not a very bright man.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He -- this was a guy who couldn't even read or write and he allegedly graduated from USC so, I mean --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I mean.  Right, you know, that's the whole foot- --
L:  Funny how that happened, yeah.
R:  Yeah, well, that whole football thing.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as long as you could play, who cares?
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I dunno.  I think to do the crime that he did, well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think, well, you wonder how anybody could do any crime and it's almost interesting to see a trial on TV to see what kinda people end up like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, but, there's no, [SIGH] I dunno, I -- you -- I've seen people that look totally innocent.  Like Ted Bundy.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ted Bundy was the classic example.  If you imagine if that trial had been televised because I don't think back then they did.  They could do that.
L:  No.  No
R:  But, for him, it would have been really hard to see him sitting there because he -- everybody said that he was, like, the -- the nicest guy.
L:  Right.  Right.  So, it would've -- it --
R:  He was a good looking guy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he was very polished --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and to know that he had this twisted side.  I mean, usually you think of the serial killers as this real weirdo who --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stays holed up in his house and maybe doesn't sh- -- doesn't shave or bathe or anything.
L:  Right.
R:  And he --
L:  That certain look.
R:  -- just totally, totally is not like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess it would have been fascinating to see what somebody who looks like you or me could -- how -- what -- what could a person like that really be like?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just to watch him and just to try to -- to sense something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I dunno.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  [inaudible] Just gives me the chills sometimes thinking about that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, even petty crime, I think of what I'd really like to see, is I'd really like to see the -- either the Enron or the World Com trials.
L:  Mhm.
R:  On television and I'm not sure that when they get to the level of -- of actually being litigated, whether --
