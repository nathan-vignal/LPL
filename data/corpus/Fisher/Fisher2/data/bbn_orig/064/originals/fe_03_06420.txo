L:  Hi.
R:  Hello, I'm Trisha.
L:  My name's Barbara.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH] Where are you from?
L:  Uh, um, Texas.
R:  Are you?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which part?
L:  Ah, between Fort Worth and Grapevine.
R:  Oh, wow!  I've got a sister who lives in, uh, Watauga.  [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah.  I know where that's at very well.
R:  Yeah, and my grandmother lives in Fort Worth and I'm from Abilene originally but --
L:  Oh, cool
R:  -- um, yeah, now I live in Garden Valley, Idaho.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's a change.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Quite the change.  So, anyway I think I'm more of a panic type person when everest[?].
L:  Well, uh-huh, you know, I thought about it and, I mean, it chilled me at first whenever I -- I heard, you know, what the topic of the day was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I thought, wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, um, [SIGH] as I get older I've decided that that doesn't help the situation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and -- and to re- remain calm is my best solution.
R:  Right.
L:  Regardless, you know, I mean, I would -- it would take me a few minutes to really thing about what was going on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but if you go back to the nine eleven, you know, I mean, the first thing I thought of was, "This has got to be terrorists".
R:  Right.
L:  Because I mean, it was [NOISE] one airplane and then it was another airplane.  And it was just -- Honey!  Did you just touch that?  [NOISE] Oh, gosh, sorry.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My son had a mousetrap in his hand.  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  Okay.  No, it's okay.  [LAUGH] He --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- he just threw a bottle on it.
R:  [COUGH] Oh, wow.
L:  [COUGH] But, you know, I mean, the nine eleven thing; you go to that and, did they know it was terrorists?  Hm --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- we'll never know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean, it was just, [SIGH] I mean, it was a scary situation and you think about it, how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's not normal for two buildings to be hit at once within --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what, ten minutes?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, at that point, if I would have been in the second building I, you know, my goal is to get out because I know that that first building's going to fall and I'm not that far away from that first building, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'm in that second building and I don't know how long it's going to be before it collapse.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know that panic was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- completely across their minds, across, you know, I mean, there's no way it could not have been just bedlam.
R:  Right.  Yeah, but that -- that's definitely true.  I agree with that. 
L:  I mean, I'm sure people were just running --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- running down -- down this fire escape -- running -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- trying to escape to get out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Trying to get help. Now I just, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't imagine.  But you know, I mean, now they're saying that we're about to get hit again --
R:  Right.  I've been --
L:  -- over Memorial Day.
R:  -- right, I've been hearing that too.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So ...
L:  But, you know, they said that over the fourth of July too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't know what to believe anymore.  And I'm just gonna -- I'm not gonna, you know, they said --
R:  Get your houses duct taped.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- don't go to the mall.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I didn't do any of that.  Did you go out and buy tape and --
R:  No.  I didn't do that.  I just always get, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get anxious I guess.  Maybe it's not so much of a panic as it is anxiousness, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I get a bunch of butterflies in my stomach and, um, just start wondering, okay so, what's gonna happen next?  And where we are, you know, it's a really a remote little mountain --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- place.  And so, I, you know, it's not like we have anything to offer them [LAUGH] I suppose, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [NOISE] so, I don't really worry too much about this particular area.  But, um, y- you just never know like you said, I mean, I'm sure the people in that Pennsylvania town weren't expecting --
L:  Oh, yeah!
R:  -- a big jet liner to come crashing down in a field --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know.  But -- and we've got -- I actually had a dream at one point that a big plane did, like, fly into my neighbor's house, you know, so, I mean, I just -- I mean -- I mean, that was quite a ways before September eleventh but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just one of those kinda freaky things that -- and anything could happen.  And we have a lot of, uh, military that fly over.  We have a lot of w- -- the black helicopters and then the military cargo planes and whatnot that fly over.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you never know if something mechanically will go wrong there, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And even though that's not terrorists, it still could happen.  I mean it's terrible -- [LAUGH] you know. 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, um I don't know, I -- but I guess I should have rephrased that and just said that it's mostly anxiousness that comes over me 'cause then we're just all sitting on pins and needles waiting on the, [NOISE] uh, government, you know, to tell us what to do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it -- I -- I don't know, I just -- but no I wasn't one who ran out and bought a bunch of water and duct tape and what not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they had all those news reports about how that's not really going to do much for ya.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Anyway, you know, so --
L:  I mean, it can still leak through.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's not -- it --
R:  And it's just not, uh --
L:  -- it's not safe proof.
R:  Right.  So, um, I don't know, I -- I worry -- I have kids myself and, um, I worry about their future and what could happen but I guess everywhere in this little tiny hick town, um, we don't really [LAUGH] have much to -- to offer I don't think.  And then of course there's, um, --
L:  You're probably pretty safe where you are because -- oh, good grief!  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  What, it takes you two seconds and you can get into -- [NOISE] gimme the scissors.  No, you can't have mommy's scissors.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Give it to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Good grief.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Are you there?  [NOISE] [LAUGH] He just took off.
R:  [MN]
R:  I was cutting coupons [NOISE] before the phone rang and so, he took off with my scissors.
R:  Oh, wow!  [LAUGH] That's not good.
L:  [SIGH] Um, yeah, I know.  I just, you know, I [MN] -- I'm not going to lead my li- -- exactly what terrorists want is they want you to live in fear.
R:  Right.
L:  And right now, number one, they've accomplished the whole airport scenario.  I mean, they're laughing at us.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  You know, it -- it -- they don't have the freedom we do and now we can't go into our own airports and watch the airplanes.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I used to go and do that and -- and, [SIGH] I mean, as far as the air force, I don't think people are in panic. They don't -- they are not -- [SIGH] they are not afraid, you know, they have to do, what is it?  They give their nail file away when they go on an airplane.
R:  Right.
L:   And, I mean, I don't think -- yeah, the inconvenience -- I know people have -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are travelling less now because they are afraid of something again, like, happening like that.  But I feel, like, if something like that happened again --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people are gonna take things -- matters in ther own hands.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't, I mean, it's like that last plane that they got, you know, I truly believe that he was trying to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- save that -- everybody on that airplane.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, it crashed in a -- in a grass field instead of actually in a building.  I mean, it may have gone into the Pentagon, who knows.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [SIGH] ...
R:  Yeah, I think he did his -- his part --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and at least veered it away from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's original destination.
L:  Right.
R:  And I agree with you, I think more people are aware and we're not so comfortable any more that we're just gonna ignore, you know, we're like you said, we're all, um, --
L:  We're all pierced[?].  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- alert and -- [NOISE] yeah --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- and that too.  And, um, and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because of that whole profiling thing, you know, we're going to look twice at who's sitting next to us and that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [several inaudible words] [NOISE]
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, but, um, yeah, and my husband just flew back, he was down there a- -- on that shuttle recovery and he flew back and --
L:  Oh, the whole thing here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He, uh, he flew home on an airplane, no big deal.  And our airport -- it was really convenient not getting -- I mean, he couldn't go where you used to be able to go and there was this whole room full [NOISE] of people waiting on all of the flights to come in, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and that's kind of a pain in the neck but, I mean, he didn't -- so he didn't have any problems and I just -- I don't know I -- and then I was just hearing on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the news that some of those people they hired -- just screened -- [NOISE] the airports -- had background, or criminal backgrounds and, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, who knows what could have happened [LAUGH] in -- since that time anyway, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- [NOISE] the amount of work -- the precautions they put up, you know, they just -- you can't totally monitor it and --
L:  No.
R:  -- we're such a big area I think that, like you said, everyone's going to take it into their own hands and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't think that's such a bad thing, you know.
L:  No.  I don't.
R:   I think it's survival of the fittest and, uh --
L:  And --
R:  -- you gotta look out for you family and yourself and --
L:  Well, and, I mean --
R:  -- I mean, yeah --
L:  -- people now, I believe after nine eleven are very strong and they believe in America, and they believe in their freedom.
R:  Right.
L:  And terrorists have just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bombarded us with all these things that they're causing us to change.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think if something like that happened again -- if that guy gets off that airplane alive -- 
R:  Yeah.  He could be lucky.
L:  -- the people or whatever, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I mean, they're talking about -- I think pilots are going to have a -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a -- [SIGH] what, they're going to have a concealed weapon --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on the cockpit now.
R:  Yeah.  He's got to.
L:  So, a- -- you know, I mean, [LAUGH] they're just not gonna -- they're not gonna get away with stuff like that.  Now the terrorist thing with putting stuff in the water or putting stuff in the air or -- I'm sure that would cause panic.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, because [SIGH] I mean, ah, some biological sort of [PAUSE] --
R:  Weapon [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- I don't know, whatever --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whatever they can shoot in the air that would cause people to get sick, you know, I mean, you've seen different movies of how people die.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So, I mean, that would probably cause a ma- --
