R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, I'm Cathy.
L:  I'm Diane.  How're you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you tonight?
L:  Good.  Where're you calling from?
R:  Uh, Texas.
L:  Uh, me too.  Whereabouts?
R:  Uh, Temple[?].
L:  Okay.  I'm in, um, South Lake.
R:  South Lake, uh, i- is that in the Austin area?
L:  It's -- no, it's actually right outside of, uh, um, Dallas, Fort Worth.  It's right near the airport.
R:  Oh, okay.  I have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have a brother that lives in the Fort Worth area so --
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so [inaudible] I know where Temple is so -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, what do we -- we're supposed to talk about terrorism?
R:  Yeah, just, uh, how you would react if, you know ... I guess if we were attacked.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Perso- -- personally, me, I would ... freak.  [LAUGH] I'm -- I'm not very level headed when it comes to things like that.  I think I would panic and ... uh, probably not being able to function very well.
L:  I think I would be the same way actually [LAUGH].  
R:  Really.
L:  You must have children?  Do you have children?
R:  Yes, I have three.  Well, of course, uh, uh, t- two of 'em are outta the home now but, uh, I have all sons and, uh, I -- I just --
L:  I do too. [LAUGH]
R:  -- um -- oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh cool.  Uh, I -- I'm just not one, I've never been one on emergency situations.  I just ... freak out, I panic, whereas my husband he would probably be very calm and cool and collected.  [inaudible] --
L:  You know I -- I agree with you.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I agree with you.
R:  You know 'cause it -- it's so scary all this -- of course I watch all this stuff on TV every day about things that are going on and my husband says, "You watch too much of that".  But, you know, I'm interested and, you know, I -- I -- I don't know if -- if you're religious or not but some of it to me seems it may have a point from the bible.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  You know ...
L:  I -- I agree.
R:  You -- i- --
L:  Well, you know, it -- it's almost like -- do you find whenever there's some terrorist -- terrorist situation, let's say, nine eleven, did you just camp out in front of the TV?
R:  Oh, I tell you ... I -- you know, I normally watch Christian shows and I was flipping the channel and I mean my heart just stopped.
L:  Yep.  Yeah.
R:  And I'm, "Oh, my gosh" and -- and why it had really got to me, it took me a while before I realized I had a friend that said she was going on a plane ride.  I think she was going up north to visit her children.  A elderly lady --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and ... [MN] it just dawned in on me that, "Oh, my gosh, she could b- -- you know, she could be in a -- in a plane up in the air during all this" and I've gotten real good friends with her the last two years and, oh, I just --
L:  Was she in the air at the time going that way or --
R:  Yes, she was.
L:  Oh, my God, [inaudible] --
R:  I found out later that she said, "Oh, yes, I was.  I was in the air" and course sh- she's a very calm, cool collected lady.  She's like eighty six and, uh, and she said the, uh, pilot came on and you know, said that the first World Trade Center, you know, plane had just went through it and -- and she said, "I just sat there and everybody else just, you know, di- did their thing and -- and --"
L:  Right, what could you do?  You're ... [LAUGH] you're --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- kind of stuck! [LAUGH]
R:  You're not gonna go much of anything -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  -- except to do some quick praying, you know?
L:  Right, and quick looking around your plane.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  True.
L:  In your plane.
R:  And as she said, in a few minutes he said, "Well, the second one has been hit and we're going to take an emergency, uh, landing" and --
L:  Yeah, 'cause they made everybody land.
R:  Huh?
L:  They made everybody land or diverted 'em to ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- different airports, uh --
R:  Yeah, and her daughters were at one, you know, particular airport and she was at another.  Can you imagine?  
L:  Oh.
R:  I would freak if I knew --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- my mother -- I -- I just -- all this stuff just goes through your head and I think it --
L:  Oh, it does.  It does.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, you know I don't know i- it keeps ... I don't know, it could happen anywhere but I don't know, you know --
L:  You know what?  That's what it is.
R:  What's that?
L:  'Cause think about it, we're both from Texas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Don't you feel like you're in the end of it all?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, d- um, come on!  I -- I could think, "Oh, [MN], nothing's gonna happen, you know, in South Lake, Texas. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, what's [inaudible] --
L:  You know?
R:  -- and just sure enough when you think like that --
L:  Yup.  Yep.
R:  Oh, my gosh, so --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- I mean, I watch all that stuff and I just --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- I like to keep informed and ... uh --
L:  Me too but, you know, I tell you, I -- I don't know if you've flown since all that but it makes you look around.
R:  Well, I tell you ... I flew one time and never again.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I -- I -- seriously, my mother and I went in two thousand and one in the summer.  I've never flown.  My sister's ...
L:  Oh.
R:  -- son got married and ...
L:  You just wanted to get there?
R:  -- I -- I even got some nerve pills from the doctor.  I said, "Hey, I've never flown.  I'm going wit- with my elderly mother and I'm just scared to death.  I'll be honest, I am scared to death".
L:  Oh.
R:  And I got up there and the longer we had to sit, the, you know, more shaky my hands got.
L:  Oh.
R:  And mom, of course, has done it before and she just sat there.
L:  She was [inaudible] fine, yep.  She was fine.
R:  You know, and there's people reading books and sleeping and I'm like, looking all [LAUGH] around and ...
L:  Well, you know what?  You know, I think, y- yeah, I -- I always -- you know, as I said, I -- I [inaudible] however, we've been -- we were, um, about three or four years ago, we went to Indonesia.  We w- went to, um, Bali for --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] for our business trip.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we -- I remember us saying at the time that, "Oh, my gosh, this is paradise, you know?" and it's -- I mean, you felt so safe there and then that nightclub, you know, recently --
R:  Right.
L:  -- blew up and there was a person in there that was from South Lake.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  And I went, "Oh, my gosh.  I've been to that place and there's someone, you know --" right and I said -- I think that's when I kinda went, "Okay, it can happen". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Some -- something's going on here.
L:  Well, we were gonna go on vacation.  We thought about going out to Costa Rico or some- some- something like that for --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, vacation.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Summer, which is not -- nothing's more or less going on there but we changed our plans.  We -- with two children, we just said, "No, you know, we're staying in, you know, one of the fifty states.  We're [LAUGH] not gonna --"
R:  R- right.
L:  "We're not going anywhere".
R:  A- see my mother -- have you ever heard of the town of China Springs, Texas?  Crawford --
L:  No.
R:  -- Crawford is not v- -- well, uh, at one time China Springs was its own little town.  It's actually in the city limits of Waco now.  And Crawford, Texas, where the prison is from --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- isn't very far from there and ... m- mom is always ... uh, saying things like, "Oh, gosh, what would happen if somebody did something in Crawford, Texas?  I guess I'll just be gone" you know?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yeah, sh- --
L:  Yeah, 'cause, you never, oh!
R:  You know, she's always talking like that and I said, "Mom, don't be saying things like -- like that" and then, you know, like she said, "Well, it could happen" and I said -- yeah, I'm thinking, "Well, yes it could but let's ... [LAUGH] -- let's don't go there".
L:  No, they're gonna go for -- they're gonna go for a bigger impact place.  
R:  Right.
L:  They're gonna -- you know what they're gonna do?  'Cause America's, you know, pastimes are, you know, obviously lots of sports --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  --so, they're gonna -- they're gonna go for a sporting event.
R:  Yeah --
L:  That's what I'm afraid of.
R:  -- they're gonna go where there's a lot of p- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- an- a- a- and like now the alert is, um, high and it's --
L:  Yep, yep.
R:  -- so you wonder, it's scary 'cause you think well, wh- what are they gonna do next?
L:  I don't know.  I don- I don't wanna know but you know ... hopefully somebody ... [LAUGH] somebody's trying to second guess, you know?  I mean, literally, somebody better be sitting around, you know, a table trying to think of ... every single possibility that could happen, you know?
R:  Right.  Right and --
L:  I mean, I --
R:  -- and you know, uh, w- well, my husband says, "Well, you don't want to be so scared that you don't wanna live your life" he says --
L:  Right, right.
R:  He says, "You just can't ..." He said, "I don't worry about things like that.  So, when it's your time to go, it's ... it -- it's --"
L:  Right.  Huh, absolutely.
R:  "-- your time to go".
L:  Absolutely.
R:  You just go on and just do your thing like you normally do and don't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- let it worry you but, you know, some of it kinda goes over my head but other things kinda just sink in there and ... you think, "Oh, gosh ..." 'cau- --
L:  Well, some of, uh -- I mean, you don't wanna put yourself in that position, you know, like, I just wouldn't go over to ... Europe.  I wouldn't go -- I couldn't go any place right now.
R:  Well, I tell you, my, uh, youngest brother, his wife, uh ... has flown to Maryland.  I know we went in the summer, June, and they came but they didn't get to stay that long so they decided to go back in September and, let me tell you, they came back on a Friday ... four days before that happened.  Four days.
L:  Four days?
R:  Four days before --
L:  Oh my --
R:  -- that happened and when h- -- when they got back and heard all that, they haven't been on a plane since then and --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- his wife works f- -- uh, she works in a ticket part of American Airlines. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my.
R:  A- and they haven't been --
L:  Well, you know --
R:  -- on planes since then.  Of course, I haven't either and I won't.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Well, you know, I have been but it -- it's definitely different and actually, um, uh, several friends of mine and I, we all have birthdays around the same time and we all turned forty ... right at -- it's like my friend turned forty on September the eleventh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh yeah, mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  It's like I'll always remember my fortieth birthday but anyway, we all had planned a trip to Las Vegas together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was a desert town.  It was just deserted.  We were like, you know, "There's nobody here!" [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was weird.
R:  Oh, God, I mean, it just ... just -- those -- those pictures just watching those plane --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and I'm thinking, "Those people on those planes".
L:  I know.
R:  The people trying to get down the elev- -- I just -- I can't picture in my head ...
L:  I know.
R:  -- and you know, they're calling their family members on the cell phone, uh, you know, you just --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you visualize what they're going through, what they're --
L:  Well, you know what?
R:  -- saying to their family members how, you know, what --
L:  I know.
R:  -- they're thinking.
L:  What do you say?  Well, you know, my tw- -- he was twelve at the time.  I -- I have two kids but that's my eldest and he was twelve at the time.  We were getting ready for school and I'm in the bathroom and he -- he goes, "Mom!".  He just turned the TV on.  He saw the plane go into the ...
R:  He saw it?
L:  Yeah, he saw it and he goes, "Oh, my gosh" you know?  And I'm trying to calm him down because he's about to go to school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  But the schools did an awesome job keeping that, you know, away from the kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, my younger one in elementary school didn't know a --
