L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Kim.
L:   I'm Linda.
R:  Hi Linda.  Where are you calling from?  Or where are they calling you from?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I live in Tampa, Florida.
R:  Oh, I'm in vo- right outside of Denver.
L:  Well, it's nice to talk to you, Kim.
R:  Well, nice to talk to you.  How's the weather down there?
L:  Oh, we're hoping for rain.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  This is a real dry period.
R:  Oh.
L:  Of course, you people in Denver have lots of water problems, don't you?
R:  Oh, terrible.  Ob- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, it's actually getting back to normal a little bit.
L:  Ooh.
R:  But not like it was.  I mean, we had one, like, forty inch snow that was a pain but it really helped out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Forty inches of snow will definitely melt into some water.
R:  Yes.  Yes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it was really nice so ...
L:  Well, anyway we're, um, [LIPSMACK] we've been promised rain all day and so far we've got clouds, which is a good first step, you know, but --
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- nothing has fallen in my area anyway from those clouds.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, um, se- -- I have one rose bush, which I bought [MN] a week ago.  I've wanted roses for years.
R:  Mhm.
R:  So, I've got one rose bush and I haven't put it in the ground [MN] and it needs to be kept watered so, I'm thinking, "Now, should I wait?  How long should I wait?"  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I have no luck with roses.  I have no advice for you [LAUGH] whatsoever.
L:  Well, I [SIGH] -- it was probably something I shouldn't have done but [SIGH] oh, anyway I did so, there you are.  And now --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- I wanna take care of it.
R:  So we're supposed to talk about terrorism I hear so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Right.  And whether we would panic and --
R:  Um, you know, I'd like to say, "No" but, you know, that's obviously the worst, you know, thing that could probably happen to us so ...
L:  Oh, I'd panic.
R:  -- on the surface I'd like to say no but --
L:  You can count on me.
R:  -- I'm sure I would.  [LAUGH]
L:  If you want --
R:  Well, absolutely.
L:  -- if you want panic you can just come on -- knock on my door and I'll -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Call you?  Call you back.
L:  -- I'll show you how it's done.  Um, is your family all with you?  Or d- -- are they scattered around the country?  Or ...
R:  Um, well, I have a husband and two real small sons so, you know, obviously we're all together.  But, you know, as far as siblings and stuff, we're all scattered all around.  So ...
L:  Yes.
R:  But I have two sons under the age of two so, um, obviously they're with us so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, you know, since it's nothing that we as a society ever dealt with.  It's not in our core threads, you know?
L:  Sure.
R:  Some people are taught to deal with that or it's a way of life for some of them and --
L:  Isn't that sad?
R:  -- you know, obviously we've never had to deal with anything like that.  And, um, no, I don't think -- I don't think anybody could honestly say that they would not panic.
L:  And we [LAUGH] -- the advice that we got from the government and it's so -- it's a joke now.  Duct tape and, what else?
R:  Oh, uh, plastic wrap for your windows.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  Okay, so --
R:  So we could all suffocate on the inside [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause there's no air.
L:  Oh, dear.  And that's so inadequate and so, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I mean, there's probably a lot to be said for covering your windows but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] do we wait until there's an orange alert and then we get out the duct tape and the plastic wrap?
R:  Well, exactly.  Or are we supposed to --
L:  Then we take it down.
R:  Oh, exactly, you know.  [LAUGH] Do we replace it every six months? Do we -- [LAUGH]
L:  There is a --
R:  -- yeah, I mean --
L:  -- there is a really good thing to do and I keep telling myself I can't afford it.  But it depends on your point of view.  In Florida, of course, we have so many hurricanes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there are awning companies that manufacture awnings that -- that reside in, um, [LIPSMACK] I'll call it a tube for lack of a better word --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that runs across the top of your windows.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Then [MN] they put a lot of electric wires into your walls and they wire those to switches so, you can push a switch button and these steel, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] [MN] shades --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- covers --
R:  Right.
L:  -- roll down and cover all the glass in your home.
R:  Ooh.
L:  And they're wonderful.  Th- they're very expensive but --
R:  Oh, I can imagine.
L:  -- they, um, they are an excellent way to go.  And that is an option, much more practical than duct tape and plastic wrap for tornadoes or hurricanes or -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- or terrorism.  [SIGH] But I have not done that.
R:  Right.  Have you been through a hurricane down there?  Or several hurricanes?
L:  I have not been involved -- I have not lived -- I -- I've been in Florida since I was in the ninth grade --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and for reasons that -- I've just not been in a place where it was touched directly by a hurricane.
R:  Wow!
L:  And -- and I'm overdue.  And Tampa hasn't had a serious problem in, I don't know -- I -- I've been here twenty two years now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We haven't had a problem and that's a long time.
R:  Wow, yeah.  That's -- that's pretty amazing actually.
L:  Yes, it is.  We're pretty close to the coast and, um, we could get a lot of flood -- well, I won't bore you with that.  But in any case --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yes I would panic and one of the things that I thought was a good idea that I read when -- after [MN] the September [COUGH] attacks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was to have a plan with -- with the f- -- all the family, the immediate family and anybody that you love, living somewhere else.  And -- and that is how shall you contact one another -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- assuming there are phone lines?
R:  Right.
L:  Um, who will be the person ... that will [SIGH] be the go between --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that everybody in the family can call or email --
R:  Exactly.  Oh, yeah, that is a good idea.
L:  -- that person and say, "We've lost our house and now we're living at -- at some school".
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, j- just whatever.  But there's gotta be, I mean, it seems like a good idea to have somebody and --
R:  To have a plan, yeah.
L:  -- and it [SIGH] -- you might have a first plan, and then a second plan.  Like, maybe a member of the family would agree to be that center point but if they're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in trouble, then who would be the number two --
R:  Yeah, two's back up, right?
L:  Right.  And all that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that did sound like ...
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  Yeah.  Really good --
R:  Another thing I've learned just last week is that, you know, when after September eleventh nobody could get through -- there is -- and all the -- um, the phone lines were jammed and so were the cellphones --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they were jammed.  But you could still send, and if you're able, text messages, you know, so, you could just say, you know, "I'm okay, [LAUGH] you know, please respond or whatever" so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I didn't realize, you know, and that's, you know, a short term fix.  Someone's -- you're trying to, you know, call out or something like that, you could always use your text message, you know, just for an initial contact, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- saying, "I'm all right or I'm not all right".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's something to keep in mind too.  You know, at least, you know, just for a bit of contact.  But all in all I think everybody would panic.  I mean, look --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- at -- I mean, look at all -- you've seen that videotape hundreds of times like we all have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- after the towers went down and everything --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I mean, you just -- you're in shock.  Of course you're going to panic.  You know, you never dreamed in a million years that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you were ever going to have to go through anything like that.
L:  Yes. 
R:  So -- 
L:  And there we be.
R:  -- you know, it's just -- it's just a different life now, you know, than it ever was before and --
L:  And --
R:  -- a reality we have to accept.
L:  We're told here ... [MN] uh, the hurricane season for us starts in another eight or nine days.  It's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- June the first until the end of November.
R:  Okay.
L:  And every year our civil defense people remind us about what to do to prepare for hurricane problems and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stocking, uh, food, non perishable and then so many gallons of water for each person for so many days --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and having lots of batteries for a portable radio.
R:  Right.
L:  And sources of light that aren't dependent on, um ... [SIGH] on electricity.
R:  Okay.
L:  And your tank should be full of gas, and you should have cash in your home that you don't spend on anything else, because if you need to pay for something and all the credit card lines are down --
R:  Oh, you better have some cash.
L:  -- then you -- you've got to have cash.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, these are all really good ideas and they would be effective for terrorism problems and -- and for hurricanes or other disasters.
R:  Mhm.
L:   So, there are things that you can do.
R:  Right.  Yeah, but I guess it would make you, you know, survive in the interim.  [COUGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  It's just, you know, completely unfathomable to me that [COUGH] -- excuse me; I'm trying to get rid of a cold my son gave me.  [MN]
L:  Oh, thank you -- thank you.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [MN] [SIGH]
R:  Won't share a cookie but he'll give me my cold.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  Did he get it in nursery school?  Or -- or --
R:  Um, I think so.  The older one only goes two days a week, you know, just for the socialization and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he came home with that cough the other day so, yeah, I'm sure he picked it up from one of his friends so ...
L:  What -- [SIGH] I was, um -- I -- I borrowed a May twenty sixth copy of Business Week.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A- uh, are both your children boys did you say?
R:  Yes.
L:  If you would [SIGH] give a thought to buying that magazine and reading it, there is a fantastic story about ... [SIGH] young boys and girls, and how girls are vastly over achieving.  They're outstripping boys just phenom- --
