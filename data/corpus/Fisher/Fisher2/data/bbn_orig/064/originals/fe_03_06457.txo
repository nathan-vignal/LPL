L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Emily.
R:  This is Barbara.
L:  Oh, hi.  Um, I'm in Utah.
R:  I'm in Indiana.
L:  Oh.  [several inaudible words].  I, um ... I don't know much about televised trials.  I don't ever watch 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't except for the -- the one, um, high profile trial that I remember is O.J. Simpson.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I was younger then so I wasn't as into it but that's the one I probably only ever seen even glimpses of.
R:  Mhm.  And then, uh, I think, um, there's a lot of stuff going on about the, uh ... oh [SIGH], that other trial --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [several inaudible words].  Um, [LIPSMACK] the one in California.
L:  Oh.  I don't think I'm aware of that one.
R:  You know, the one where the wife and his -- his pregnant --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- wife and baby ended up, um -- they found 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the bay.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, I have heard that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, where they're thinking that it might have been the husband that --
R:  Right, mhm, yeah.
L:  -- that did that 'cause he just took out a big life insurance policy.
R:  Yeah, he did a lot of weird things, I guess but yeah, um, no, I -- it's not -- I don't really like watching that stuff.  I mean ... we get like Court TV and stuff like that but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I don't like, you know, really watching it.  I don't like watching the investigations too much.  I don't like watching too much stuff like that.  What about you?
L:  I think it gets kinda depressing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I do too. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, um --
L:  [NOISE] It's like, "Oh, I don't wanna watch that". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I don't want those criminal across the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into our home and stuff, you know, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Part of it might be that I just don't have cable so ... [LAUGH]
R:  You don't got cable?  Hm.
L:  Yeah, I would never -- you know, a lot of those channels ... [NOISE] you know, like the channels that come in, say like, Judge Judy and Judge Joe Brown --
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] -- and that kinda [inaudible] [LAUGH].  So --
R:  Well, I'm talking about regular Court TV.  Actually, we, uh --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, like --
R:  -- we have satellite TV.  We don't have cable, we have satellite.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  So, we can get like just about pretty much anything on our TV which is not --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- always good but ...
L:  You gotta be nice sometimes.
R:  -- and there's a lot of, uh -- yeah, there's a lot of, um ... other TV like, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, what do you call it?
L:  Mm.
R:  Criminal, um ... Justice?  Uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the background of, you know, how -- how the, um, investigations go and stuff and about differ things and ... my husband's --
L:  I --
R:  -- like really into history.  He watches it [inaudible] sometimes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't care.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I -- I -- I'm more interested in how the process works.
R:  Pardon?
L:  [inaudible] actual case [inaudible].
R:  The process?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, of how they do the trial and what took place.
R:  Oh, huh?
L:  That's more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- interesting to me than ...
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- the trial. [LAUGH]
R:  I think it would be more interesting though to actually go there and watch it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Instead of having it, like, broadcast on TV.
L:  [NOISE] Of course then you can't watch it in your pajamas but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] That's true.  You can't be as comfortable as you like and snack when you like or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- go to the bathroom [LAUGH].  Well, you can probably still go the bathroom but -- yeah, hm.  Interesting.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I ... I wonder what will come of that -- that case, um, in California if he'll ... [several inaudible words] --
R:  I don't know.  There was another one too that I remember that was really, um ... high profile --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it was I think a Mendez.  Mendez or Mendoza --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- brothers?
L:  I think I might have [inaudible] that.
R:  The boys that, um, killed their parents.
L:  Okay, I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the name sounds familiar but I don't think that I knew very much about that one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.  People do some weird things.  It would be hard to look at those people not knowing whether they're guilty or innocent, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's almost like you're prejudging them. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, that's right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it -- the thing about having it broadcast on the media is that everybody sees it and everybody has an opinion, you know, and everybody talks about it and, you know, different things and, basically, um ... court is, I would think it's supposed to be private, you know?  I mean, there's some case -- you know, court cases where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the public can be in on it but I mean, it ... I think there's too many people were talking in the media would get, you know, it would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just get slanted an- and everybody gets to look at it.  [several inaudible words] --
L:  And it might be kinda hard to find unbiased jurors if people have heard of it.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  'Cause people will already form an opinion.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah --
L:  Might be a little --
R:  -- that's what I mean.  Right, yeah, that's true but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's been hard to do that but of course I think, um, I don't know if they're talking about the whole process, you know, before it goes to -- to court -- sue court and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- after court because ... the jury process would be before the court actual trial.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?  I didn't know that.
R:  Well, I mean, they would have to pick the jury before they did the trial.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that makes sense.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm a little slow. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  [LAUGH] So ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] But it does make sense.
R:  I wonder if, um ... you talk about these courts [NOISE], um, cases in class.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I don't -- [NOISE] I don't know.  I wonder if that's the case, you know?  They -- they might in some of the, um ... [LAUGH] older sch- -- you know, like, I don't know, high school, college classes or whatever they might ... discuss things.  I don't know.  They might do.
L:  Yeah, like watch it [NOISE] and kind of point out things like, "This is how you do this" or ... [NOISE] that might be [several inaudible words] to look at it.
R:  Yeah, or maybe it's just like they might have it, like, an assignment.  Do a commentary on it or something, you know, like a report, you know, "Watch this and --" yeah, right, "Tell us what you think and what you observe and stuff" you know?  That -- that probably might, you know -- they'll be a good way -- a good reason to do it to get how people actually ... you know, sit down and look at it and observe, you know, t- take out, um, things from it.
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I don't know, I was just thinking.  I wonder if ... maybe they just have a ... [SIGH] I mean, partly because people are just curious but then there's ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of people that are against the system and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] different things.  I wonder if they just wanna have a few of the high profile, you know, type trials televised --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that they can say, "Look, we are doing something about it".  Maybe to kinda ... you know, make more believers out of people or ... I don't know.
R:  Well, yeah.  Well, and another thing is that would be kinda really biased if they only did the high profi- -- you know what I mean?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Regular people get in trouble too.  Regular people have court problems and just some things, you know, that ... that go on, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] So ... [NOISE] it just seems like, you know, a lot of the high profile cases and the people that are really like, um, popular and stuff, you know, their --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  -- their money influences anything that they do anyway whether it's the court system or what.  Taking out of court.
L:  Yeah, they'll just buy their [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they can afford --
L:  Way out of the case or --
R:  Bought a high price attorneys and, you know, and they can [NOISE] ... uh, but, um ... wasn't that, um -- I'm trying to think of that guy's name.  Anderson, and that's the one that in California that ... was accused of --
L:  I think so.
R:  -- of killing his wife.  Scott Anderson or something like that?  Wasn't he in the military too?
L:  Oh, my God!  I -- I heard that.  The only thing I knew of th- -- his wife was dead.  They had later found the body ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that he ... [several inaudible words] just taken out a life insurance right before.  And I thought, "Well, that by itself isn't too suspicious" --
R:  I --
L:  -- 'cause if she's pregnant.
R:  Right.  I heard some other stuff too, like that he had a girlfriend.  And affair or something --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and some other stuff going on but see, there you go.  That's like, if this is, like, high proi- profile court cases are broadcast on TV it's like you and me, you know?  I re- -- everybody talking about, like, you said.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And forming an opinion that, you know ... a- ahead of time.  So th- --
L:  Unless someone maybe innocent, they're gonna be, of course ... a lot of people are gonna think of them as guilty.  They may be innocent.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ruled as innocent and then ... afterwards people may still ...
R:  Think that --
L:  -- judge them like if they go for a job interview or whatever.
R:  Yeah.  They might be prejudged because of that.  Right, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Or things will come out --
R:  There'd be a bias against 'em.  Mhm.
L:  -- that maybe from their past for [LAUGH] ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not the best things. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, well, actually, of course, if you go for a job they're --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- gonna know all your background anyway if it's criminal activity because --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- pretty much anywhere you go for a job now they run a criminal background check.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mm.
L:  I'm glad [several inaudible words] but I feel bad for people like ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my cousin was in some dumb high school thing.  He was involved in teasing[?] and he was the only one that was eighteen.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, that's gonna go on his record for his whole life that --
R:  'Cause he's eighteen. 
L:  -- he was a stupid kid. [LAUGH]
R:  He protes- te- -- he did it for just state or what?
L:  No, he did.
R:  Oh, and --
L:  And --
R:  -- he was eighteen so it's gonna be a -- uh, yeah, a matter of record.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, and so I just wonder how those things stick with you.  How that affects you.  It'll be interesting to see if it ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- affects him throughout his life even though --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that was stupid to do it but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people change from when you're eighteen [LAUGH] hopefully. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH] I'd be worried if they were the same. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's --
