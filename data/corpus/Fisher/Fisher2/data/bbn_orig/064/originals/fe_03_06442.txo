R:  Hi.  How are you again?
L:  Hi.  Uh --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Somebody else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, um, I -- this is my third time that I'm calling on the same thing.
L:  Oh --
R:  I don't --
L:  Okay, this is my first time.  This is my first call through Fisher so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay, well, this is my first day that I'm doing Fisher's but I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- doing three calls on the same topic so we might as well ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, Jeez! [LAUGH]
R:  That makes it ten, ten, ten, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Y- yeah, really.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And get it all together, get it all done at one time.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] W- --
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, okay, so it's still pretty early there.
R:  Mm, well right now, exactly on the dot it's eight O five.
L:  Eight O five?  Yeah, it's eleven O seven here, eleven O six here so -- [LIPSMACK] so do you think they'd, uh, panic in a terrorist attack?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm laughing.
L:  [LAUGH] No, I know.
R:  This is my third time calling so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Um, do you think, uh, I would, um, panic or they would panic?
L:  That they would panic.  That other --
R:  Um --
L:  -- people would panic --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
L:  -- as a general rule?
R:  Overall, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.  I don't think --
R:  I think so.
L:  -- that there's any question.  I think they proved that in New York.
R:  Yeah, exactly, but at least they're more organized in vers- -- well, it's -- used to be o- easier to go and get a ticket and fly out, you know?
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  Nowadays it is -- a lot of security and they're more secure and they're more strict.  Of course, it wouldn't be after what happened and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in a way it's better.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  M- more organized.
L:  I agree with that but you th- you don't think you would panic?  Is that why you said you versus they?
R:  Um, no, because the other lady, she asked me if I would panic on the other conversation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I wouldn't -- basically I wouldn't panic.
L:  Well, you're out there in earthquake country.  You're [LAUGH] used to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know, being ready at a moments notice.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  So, did they have other -- when you did your other phone calls, were there more than two people on the line?
R:  Oh, no, just one.  Um, I had, um, other -- uh, I had two conversations with two different people and we were discussing -- well, the other one we were discussing Vietnam and ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- you know, versus what ha- -- the war here and, you know, different s- -- different subjects and what's going on.  The cruelty that happened after, you know, the deaths of, you know, the soldiers or those who survived, you know?  They have disabled problems and they're trying to sue.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I didn't know that.
R:  Different -- well, there was one topic I was -- was discussing to him that I had read in Reader's D- Reader's Digest --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in regards to one of the +Vietnamese -- Vietnamese sold- um, one of the soldiers from ... ar- from America suing -- trying to sue one of the Vietnamese companies.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  With the car dealers or any -- any sort [SIGH] ... of, um -- or any -- anybody who took place ... in, you know, back then in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the -- any company that took place with supporting the war at that time --
L:  The Vietnam war.
R:  -- the Vietnam war at that time.
L:  That's really interesting.  I hadn't read that.  Where did you see that article?
R:  Reader's Digest.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  I don't know where.  [NOISE]
L:  That's interesting.  We'll have to do a search and see if I can pull that up.  I had no idea.
R:  But ... but the court is not supporting -- not -- non supportive.  There's a lot -- it was talking about how we go and fight for the war, etc.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then basically when we come back, you know, we don't get support from our court systems or the justice systems.  They don't know what the hell we go there for.
L:  Oh, that's the God's truth.  That's the God's truth.  And -- well, the military in general.  I mean, we don't pay the military nearly ... what they're worth.  I have a girlfriend who has a husband in the Navy right now and I mean they're just one step above poverty.  It's a damned shame.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Truly is a shame that they -- that he's over there, you know, fighting for us and -- and we're ... you know, basically pushing her to shop for food stamps.  I mean, I think it's terrible.  I really do.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, that's the way the economy works though.
L:  You're not in the military?
R:  No, never will plan to be.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, my hus- [LAUGH] -- my ex husband and my boyfriend now, they're both -- they were both, um, you know, residents.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of another country.
L:  Ooh.
R:  One is a resident and the other one is a ... well, he doesn't have papers so basically ... you know, what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't need that -- I don't need that stress in my life.
L:  Right, no, I understand that.
R:  If something like that were to happen, you know what I mean?
L:  Are your, um, your boyfriend, is he, uh ... is he Middle Eastern?
R:  No, he's, um --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- central.  [inaudible].
L:  I wondered how that's -- that would, you know -- how that's affecting ... some of the Middle Eastern -- I teach and I know one of our students is a former Iraqi refugee --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um ... [LIPSMACK] he spent a lot of time in Afghanistan with his family after the first war and then --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they went over into Saudi Arabia and it's just -- you know, listening to him talk about how he's been treated in light of all this terrorist stuff has been really difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  He's -- I mean, for God's sake --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the kid's fifteen, you know?  Been through more in fifteen years than some of us will see in a lifetime. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] That's the way life is.  [NOISE] Sometimes it can be hard sometimes, you know?
L:  [NOISE] And are those kids?
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  I hear little ones.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Thank God mine are in bed.
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] So, um [SIGH] what else can we talk about? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not sure.  [LAUGH] We're running out here.  I don't think -- we need to get our ten minutes in here.  I think we're up to five. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Canned food.
L:  What's -- [LAUGH]
R:  Canned food's emergency utilities.  That's another topic w- um, the other two mentioned.
L:  Oh yeah!
R:  That I talked to.  Yeah, people --
L:  Did you do anything like that when they were going through that terror stuff?
R:  Well, to tell you the truth, my boy, I wasn't really into it.  I was probably awake with the flashlights and maybe some of -- you know, some canned foods and stuff but I mean, collecting plastic and tape --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think for the windows is ridiculous, you know?
L:  W- I did that.  My husband coulda killed me.  I came home.  He said, "What the hell did you do?" [LAUGH] 'cause I stopped and bought the industrial strength plastic.  It's still sitting in the cupboard with the duct tape.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He thought I was outta my damned mind.  Truly.  But, uh, you know ... [LAUGH] I -- and I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, what were you gonna do with it?  And people said if you've sealed up your windows you'd suffocate anyway so [LAUGH] I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it wasn't real bright in the long run, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In retrospect it was a waste of fifty good dollars. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, actually you could -- well, if you decided to paint, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, one of, um, something.  If you decided to paint, like a house or something, you could always use it for carpet, you know?
L:  Yeah, oh, that's true 'cause it is industrial strength but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm gonna hold on to it just for a little bit longer.  They just raised the terror alert again and th- -- I don't know, it just -- it scares me.  It really does.  I just, uh -- I think -- I'm in Pittsburgh and, uh, so we're not exactly, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in a -- in a hot spot but I still think that, uh, you never know, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially with all that -- we have nuclear power plant twenty miles from us and that's kinda scary because they've put the national guard back at the, uh, gates and ... for security and so it's been real interesting to see that on the news. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, armed guards and, uh, same with the airports.  They've got the national guard back at one of our airports so that's tough to see.
R:  Well, basically, um, [SIGH] well, how did you feel 'bout -- d- I mean, did -- did you see a bunch of people with -- holding up signs etc.  How did you feel?
L:  [NOISE] What did you mean?
R:  You know?  Did you want the war or did ...?
L:  Oh, with the war?
R:  Were you supportive of the -- were you supportive of the war or the other?
L:  I was not supportive of the war effort but I was supportive of the government once they sent them.  I just -- I couldn't protest.  I mean, I -- I -- I felt like, uh, I didn't believe in it but once they were there I cou- I -- felt that by protesting you were -- it was an unpatriotic thing to do.  I really did.
R:  I think I feel the same in that regards.  I mean -- I mean, there's noth- -- I mean ... basically there's nothing we could do to bring all those people back that th- --
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?  Second of all, but to prevent something like that from happening and, you know, f- -- in other words, if somebody bullies you, are you going to let you bully you around?
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, in that respect, yeah, I think it was right, you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  To -- to bring out the guys over there but at the same time, you know, I'm still, you know, because of the way they act from war to war and then what happens after.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm not supportive of that. [LAUGH]
L:  I just wish that Bush would've said why he was going in the first place.  I mean, he tries to wrap it in this veil of, you know, well, the -- m- weapons of mass destruction and then when he didn't find anything, and suddenly it was, "Well, they're in Syria.  They're in Jordan".  I mean, it -- you know, just -- if he would've just been honest with the American people and said why we were going in the first place because we were being bullied.  Because we were being pushed around.  You know, because of the terrorist threats.  That's fine but, you know, he -- he f- -- couched it in garbage I think and -- and then when they didn't find it, he's trying to backtrack and that bothers me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But like I said, with friends that are in the military it's hard to -- to protest anything like that and still seem like you're ... you know, patriotic.  So, [LIPSMACK] that was difficult.  That was definitely a difficult one.  [NOISE] Especially since I'm a democrat.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't vote for him, I hate to tell you.
R:  Well, did you -- um, by then -- any [inaudible] chance did you vote?  Was there any voting going on ... lately?
L:  We d- -- we had primaries on Tuesday.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, but there was -- it was only judges and I hate to say, I mean, I'm embarrassed to say I did not go and vote because --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I didn't get outta work until late so --
R:  I was gonna say, why vote when you could work there?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  For extra money.
L:  At the voting polls?
R:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R: Yeah, yeah. 
L:  I didn't know they paid people to do that?  I thought that was all volunteer work.
R:  No, that's not volunteer.  Of course, not.  Are you crazy?  Staying there from six o'clock in the morning all the way 'til ... eight PM? [LAUGH]
L:  I take it you work the polls?
R:  Yeah, I work the polls.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah, because I'm pregnant right now it's hard for me to get a position so --
L:  Oooh!  How far along are you?
R:  Five -- um, five months.  [LAUGH] Five months.
L:  Ooh!  When September eleventh happened, getting back to the terrorist thing, I was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sitting in the, uh, in my OBs office.  I had -- had just had my baby; she was six weeks old and I was in for my six week check and it was, uh -- so I have a little one too.
R:  Mm.
L:  Do you know if it's a boy or girl?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Not yet.  It doesn't show up in the ultrasound.  The legs were, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Covered, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Ooh, do you want a boy or a girl?
R:  I wanted a girl but if a boy comes, you know, it doesn't matter.
L:  Is this your first?
R:  My third.  I have --
L:  Your third?
R:  -- a nine year old, a s- -- and a seven year old so --
L:  Oh, well, I have a nine year old and a six year old and a twenty one month old so -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can --
