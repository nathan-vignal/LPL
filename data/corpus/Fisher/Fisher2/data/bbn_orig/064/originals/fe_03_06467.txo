L:  Hi, my name is Pat.
R:  Uh, my name is Genie. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess we're ... talking about this now? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I watched the O.J. Simpson trial, quite a bit of it. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I did too and you know, it just went on and on and on and on. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it -- it just got to where it was too much to watch it all the time.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, I don't know on high ones like that who benefits from it being televised.  Um ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  My husband he's -- I mean, uh, that's what he likes to do.  He's fascinated by this and he watched A- Anita Hill.  I can't think a that guys name.  You know --
L:  Oh, Clarence Thomas?
R:  Yeah.  Uh, he watched that.  I mean, uh, but he -- it just fascinates him but me, it just -- it just bores me, you know?
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I just do- -- I -- I just wanna know the beginning and the -- the end.
L:  Well, I have a degree in sociology and I like watching people and watching things but like you're saying, it seemed to me that it just kind of dragged on and on and on.
R:  Well, it was -- what?  It's almost a year?
L:  Yeah.  And [SIGH] I don't know ... um, [LIPSMACK] it's kind of a waste of peoples times that are sitting there watching it for a year, you know, [LAUGH] to me.
R:  Right.  And -- and how would you get a fair trial?
L:  Well, that's just it too.  The only ones that they seem to, uh, publicize like that are ones who can afford attorneys like O.J. Simpson did but if you were a poor black person and had a, um, public defender, would anybody waste their time filming your trial?  I don't think so. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  That's true.  [LAUGH] And just like this -- this guy who just killed his wife -- supposedly killed his wife and -- and baby --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, you know, it's -- it's gonna go on and on and on for a long time.
L:  Right.  Right.  It just seems like people should have more interesting things to do with their lives ... 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  More pressing matters that they could spend their time on. [LAUGH]
R:  I like to read.  I mean, I'm never ever bored.  I could always find something to do.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, me too.  I don't -- I don't watch soap operas.
R:  Oh no.
L:  And most of the time when the TV is on, I have other things that I'm doing at the same time, you know?
R:  Right I have -- I -- I read while I watch TV and it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe -- maybe I'll hear something, you know, and sometimes I miss a thing and I think, "Oh!  I should of paid attention but oh well".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "It's not life or death thing.  You know I don't really have to know this".
L:  Uh-huh.  Hm.  Where --
R:  So, where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm in Montana.
R:  Oh, I -- I live here in -- I'm in Ohio.
L:  Oh.
R:  Cambridge, Ohio.
L:  Uh-huh.  I don't know exactly where Cambridge is.  I've been through, uh, Cincinnati before but ...
R:  Uh, it's -- it's probably about -- it's probably close to three hours from Cincinnati.
L:  Uh-huh.  Huh.
R:  We're about eighty -- eighty nine, ninety miles from Columbus, Ohio, the capital.
L:  Mhm.  We flew through Cincinnati on one of our trips back east last year but other than that I've -- I've not really driven through there or anything so ...
R:  I guess as far out west as I've been we went to, uh, Arizona --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Phoenix and then we drove to Las Vegas and Grand Canyon and -- and then we went to this one place that says California other side of the sign so we stood on the other side of the sign, had our pictures taken ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is probably ten years ago.
L:  Uh, just so you could say you'd been to California, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  That's right; that's right.  Impress my kids.
L:  [LAUGH] Hm.
R:  But do these profi- -- I mean, I just don't ... I don't know who's making the money on these high profile, um, you know?
L:  Well -- well, that's what I wonder because they wouldn't do a year long trial unless somebody was making some money off of it whether it's the advertisers or -- I mean, there's gotta be somebody.
R:  And them lawyers are really getting the money.
L:  Uh-huh
R:  You know, and I mean, and ... I don't -- I just don't understand in the legal system, I mean, they -- they have to ... they're not allowed to tell what they know, I mean, the lawyers aren't.  I mean, just -- I don't know.  I just don't understand all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It just to me it's all fixed.  It's how much money you have or the best lawyer you have.
L:  Exactly.  That's -- that's exactly what it is because it's not true that everybody gets the same opportunity and justice.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know?
R:  Thank goodness we don't have no big profiles around -- you know ... uh, around here.  No trials.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, there -- there was one.  A -- a college girl had killed her baby a year ago just, uh, I mean, it kinda shocked us that it happened around here 'cause our area's not a real big ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:   -- big area you know but, uh, it was kinda -- it's high profile.  She's gonna be sentenced.  I don't know what they're gonna do with her.
L:  Huh.
R:  But she just had a baby and put it in the dumpster.
L:  Huh.
R:  There weren't nobody know she was pregnant.
L:  Huh.  It -- it's sad that, um, people do that, you know?  That they -- they don't give the baby to ... somebody, you know?  I mean, here people are adopting out of Russia and every other country and yet there are ones like that being put in a dumpster here.
R:  And just like life is not important.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like that poor little baby didn't have a right to live.
L:  Hm.
R:  I have a --
L:  I don't --
R:  I have a grandson.  He's -- he's not -- he's had a lot of medical problems and I think, " Oh, my goodness, you know, I'm just so glad that nothing happened to him".
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  But that's about the most profile thing we have around here.
L:  Huh.  Well, we've had [SIGH] some high profile things here in Montana happen, you know, like Ted Kaczynski was found here and some things like that but, um, the trial wasn't here.
R:  That was a -- a big trial but I mean it wasn't as televised as OJs though.
L:  N- oh, no.
R:  I me- --
L:  Huh-uh.  But that's another one that he -- I don't think that he had a -- a private attorney, you know?  I don't think he had any money.
R:  Ted Kaczynski?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm surprised somebody didn't do it for free just for the not- notoriety.
L:  Well, you know, he was so crazy though that --
R:  Oh, I know he was.
L:  -- you know ...
R:  He's better off [LAUGH] with that now.
L:  Well, he is.  He is really --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- because at least he's, you know, probably forced to be on medication that at least keeps him half way sane, you know?
R:  It just, uh -- I just ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I -- I just -- these court systems, like I said, it just ... you know what, it just ... uh, who you are and how much money you got.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yep.
R:  If I had to have a trial I -- I would -- and odd lawyers around here, I mean, I don't know.  I just don't know if I'd trust any of 'em [LAUGH] around here.  I'd have to go to some big city or something, then you don't even know when you go to a big city to get one.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And you know, I think even -- even no matter how good of an attorney you have there's so many more politics things involved, you know, like ... the relationship with your attorney with the judge and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the prosecutor with the judge and, you know, I mean, there's no much involved that really isn't on the up and up.
R:  Right and there's so many things that they're not allowed to bring up at the trial.
L:  Exactly.  Mhm.
R:  Things that can help you.
L:  Mhm, yep.
R:  I know, I like to watch Law and Order. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I like some of those programs but is -- they're getting to be that there are so many of those every night too --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know?  There's CSI Miami and then there's Law and Order and then there's, you know -- and you just like, so many murders on TV and --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and then the trials and stuff and people are just so entranced [LAUGH] by these things.
R:  Oh, I'm not entr- -- I don't know what it is I like about.  I -- I just -- I mean, I don't watch it every -- every night --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible].  It's just like Wednesday night they had a big, was it three hour thing?  I thought, "I'm not watching that".
L:  Oh, gosh.  Was it a season finale or something?
R:  Yeah, I- and it's all about these different ones about somebody hanging their baby over the edge.  I mean, just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that -- I mean, just to me it looked like it was gonna be stupid so I just -- I just don't watch it.
L:  I kind of worry about programs like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- giving other people, you know, that are kinda on the verge of doing things ideas.
R:  I think it gives people ideas.
L:  Yeah, that's what I think too and it seems like crime is just increasing something awful and -- and the kinds of crime, you know, are so violent.
R:  Well, like that Robert Blake, you know?  He- he'll probably do the same thing, you know, that O.J. Simpson did --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he'll -- I mean, I'm not saying he did or didn't do it because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we all don't know but he'll probably get off.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I wouldn't be at all surprised.
R:  Sad part's his little girl.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  You know, lost her mom but I mean, maybe he didn't do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that they have to prove that he di- -- that he did it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's probably why O.J. got off.  They didn't really have somebody that saw him do it.
L:  Right, right.  [SIGH] Huh.
R:  I got a -- a -- a nephew that's a lawyer but he -- he's not a criminal lawyer.  I think he's, uh -- does cases not -- I mean, he works for the state auditor.
L:  Oh, huh.
R:  Or the state whatever she is.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Representative, yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  But I mean he -- I don't think he -- he doesn't do murder trials but --
L:  Yeah, it's a different kind of law, like, corporate law or something like --
R:  Yeah, that's it.  Corporate law, that's what he's into.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I know one thing, they sh- -- they sure do make a lot of money.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, they do.
R:  I mean but --
L:  Most all attorneys do.
R:  So -- but I think it takes seven years to be one though.
L:  That's what it takes here.  You have to have a -- a four year degree and then -- then in law school for three years ... so you have a total of seven.
R:  Then I just couldn't get up there in front of a whole judge and jury and ... I mean, that's just not me. [LAUGH]
L:  Have y- --
R:  You have to be a bold person.
L:  Have you ever served on a jury?
R:  No.  Nope, I never have.
L:  I've been called for jury before but I was able to get out of it, um ... I -- I really don't care to be on a jury.
R:  No, me either.
L:  You know, I -- I don't think for one thing [LAUGH] ... that I'm what i- -- what is the word, you know, where you don't have preconceived notions about it?
R:  Right, yeah, I -- I -- I couldn't be fair.
L:  Y- yeah, I couldn't either.
R:  I couldn't be fair, you know, if a person I di- -- is a person, say, someone I didn't like I probably wouldn't like 'em.
L:  Mhm.
