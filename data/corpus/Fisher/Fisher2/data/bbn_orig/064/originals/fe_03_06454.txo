L:  Shelly Beasley.
R:  Hi, Carol Hubbs.  How are you, Shelly?
L:  I'm just fine, thank you.
R:  Okay.  We've got a tough, uh, topic to tackle here looks like.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um, well, what do you think about, um, televising the high profile, uh, court cases?
L:  Well, I feel that they should not be due to ... that I think it interrupts and ... hurts, you know, the -- the f- -- the person on trial, you know, whether it's, um, you know, if -- if they're guilty or not.  Um, y- you know, I know they -- they sequester all th- the jury and such but, you know, they've got to hear things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Somehow or another.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, I just think they need to ha- -- the jury needs to have an unbiased opinion ... of, you know ... the person that's on trial.
R:  Right.  Right.  Um, well, I feel the same way you do.  I really think that, um, when you're -- you are in court ... [SIGH] and you are, [SIGH] uh, your fate is being decided, it's no one's business, uh, especially [LAUGH] ... the rest of the -- the country. [LAUGH] Uh --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Uh --
L:  Well, like, you know, take the, um, Scott Peterson case.
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  Are you familiar?
R:  Yes, w- slightly.  Uh-huh.
L:  Watching the news [inaudible] Saturday?  Well, this morning I heard -- of course I know they're not on trial yet, but this morning I heard something, um, on the news that, um, is leading towards m- he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not even being, you know, guilty anymore.  That it might be ... Colt involved.  Well, you know ... hasn't all this media and everything already damaged him?
R:  Yeah, it has.  It has.
L:  You know, and it's the same thing, i- you know, when -- when something actually does go to ... court.  I think it's, you know, it's ... very damaging ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, to the person that's on trial.
R:  Right, I -- I agree with you completely.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not for it at all and, uh --
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- you know, it -- if w- --
L:  -- I don't care if the person is guilty or not, they should get a fair trial.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I agree with you completely. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm, um -- I live here in, uh ... south of Lexington, Kentucky.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm from Texas.  [LAUGH]
R:  Are you from Texas?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, well, then ... y- your governor [LAUGH] ... he was, uh, our -- now President Bush.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's a big advocate.  He, uh ... of a death penalty.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And, uh ... I don't know. 
L:  I just -- I just don't feel [SIGH] ... I mean, I know that part of televising and -- and such of -- of trials ... is, um, you know, a person's -- or the -- the actual, um, public's right to see this and such but, uh, you know, I just -- I still just don't feel ... like it -- like that's right.
R:  Right.  It's not right a- and it just -- it -- it completely slants, um -- it d- distorts, you know, um ... everyone else's view of that person.  Let's say --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- they get off.  Well, let's take O.J. Simpson.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I remember from the chase.  The first time they chased him down the highway in, was it LA?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh ... my mom and I watched that and she said, "This is the worst thing I have ever watched in my life".  It's kinda like, you know, the first reality TV show.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And then we all went through, what was it, eleven months?  Nine months of his trial.
L:  No.
R:  And it was like --
L:  It's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  It was too much --
L:  Yeah, what -- what -- what did that cost ...
R:  Yep.
L:  -- the state?  That state?
R:  Yep.  Cost ...
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- a lot of money. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I -- i -- you know, you probably can't even stop to e- even count how much it cost a- a- and you know, so many states are in -- in so much trouble right now.
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, sit back and -- and look ... at things.  Especially, you know, televised trials and dragging it on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for nine months like that one did.  Just, I think it ... it not only, you know, is ... hurting the person on trial but, you know, there's -- there's many other entities that it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- hurting.
R:  Yeah, I think it should be illegal.  Um, there needs to be another amendment stuck on to all the amendments that we do have now --
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  -- making that illegal, yeah.
L:  Right.  I agree.
R:  To put someone's court case, whatever, on trial for ... everybody and their uncle to see and watch.
L:  Right.
R:  Plus it becomes public domain.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That +enercot fi- -- um, trial is filed and it becomes public, whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Um [COUGH] ... and anybody can go in and access the records. 
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's like, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  I wanted to make, you know ... I don't know.  I guess they have to go before a judge and +ask ask permission to have it done and, uh ...
L:  I don't know.  You think?
R:  Oh.  Yeah, I believe.  They have to ask the defendant.
L:  Like -- like the -- oh, the media --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and such has to ask permission?
R:  Right.  To have a -- to go ahead and televise it and the judge says, "Yes" or "No", yay or nay.  But I think it's -- they shouldn't be allowed at all.
L:  No.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  You know, if I were a judge I -- I would not agree to have it publicized.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wouldn't.  I just ... you know, I think ... I -- I think if a judge, um ... has really committed themselves to their job and to actually finding that person guilty or not knowing if they don't do it but you know, you know what I'm saying?  They're kinda like the -- the lead ...
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, uh, i- to me it just seems like that would be ... damaging them too.  You know, I mean, especially, like you said on that O.J. Simpson ... trial.  I mean, you know, it started dragging on for so long and so long and so long ... I didn't look at ... any of those -- the lawyers or the judge.  Even, I wouldn't say the jurors, but y- you know, most parties involved ... i- to me, they lose ... cr- credentially.
R:  R- credibility.
L:  Or credibility.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  I mean, i- i- it just seemed to be like a circus.
R:  It is.  It's just a -- it's a media circus.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  A way to get ratings I think.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that's what --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- why they do it just to ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, ask the judge.
L:  And you know there's b- [inaudible] things that can be on TV than that.
R:  Mm well, actually if you think about it now, we have all these reality TV shows.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, like, uh [NOISE] oh ...
L:  Survivor and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  Survivor.
R:  Survivor.  Um, from -- from, I think the O.J. trial.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There it goes, see?  People want it so bad so let's see if -- we'll try this.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, another one, what was it?  They put all these people in the Amazon.  Get me outta here, I'm famous, or something like that.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What was it?  It was just --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- redac- ridiculous.
L:  Yeah, that was --
R:  [inaudible] anyway.
L:  Good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was our -- was our ... did we have a two part on this topic or -- I can't recall.  I should of written it down.
R:  Um, yep.  It was like what do you feel basically about, um, televising, uh, famous court cases and also what -- second part was, you know, which ones do you remember. The one -- [LAUGH] only one I remember is, uh, O.J. Simpson.
L:  [inaudible] Hm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what about, um ... ex President, Bill Clinton?
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That one was a TV circus also.
L:  Oh!  Major.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.
L:  If -- if that ... it had been me.  If I had been Bill Clinton, would you not just want to crawl under a -- a rock --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- for the rest of your life?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  Well, now --
L:  You know?
R:  -- they found out that, um, President Kennedy, same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He, uh ... had an affair with a nineteen year old ... [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- intern.
L:  Yeah.  That's [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
R:  But anyway ... well, but back then, of course, it -- uh, it was all kept hush hush to protect the President.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh ... so anyway ...
L:  But I just -- I just think it's very demeaning to ... most parties involved.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
R:  [inaudible].
L:  And you know ... I would not have wanted to be a juror on any major --
R:  No.
L:  -- of those trials.
R:  I don't know any --
L:  You know bec- -- you know they --
R:  I don't know how they found anybody [LAUGH] that was impartial.
L:  That would agree, I know.
R:  Yeah, because you have to pass all these tests.
L:  Mhm.
R:  One of my employees was a ... on a ... a -- was gonna go for jury duty and they asked all these questions and he said, "Carol, can you get me out of it?" and I'm like, "No, I can't".  I said, "You just have to go ahead and ... go head and ... you know, they'll ask you questions and answer hon- honestly and, uh ... then they'll [LAUGH] decide if you're good enough for jury".  He didn't make it on jury duty and I'm so happy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I imagine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially on -- if it's a real long drawn out trial.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, he -- he --
L:  How did these people ...?
R:  He had trouble understanding information.
L:  Really?
R:  Simple things like, you know, like we're talking back --
L:  Well --
R:  -- and forth like ... we had to repeat over and over and over.
L:  You know, I mean ... as far as the jurors go ... say ... you know, for O.J. Simpson's trial, okay, don't you know that after it was all said and done that they probably had a lot of ... flack to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- counteract, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [inaudible] counter.  I mean, gosh, I wouldn't want anybody to know I had [LAUGH] been on a jury.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just -- ooh!
R:  Yeah.  Sh- ... yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  All the way around it's just ... I don't --
R:  Huh?
L:  All the way around, it's just a bad thing I think.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  For everybody.
R:  -- I agree with you.  Uh, I just, you know, put myself in those defendants, uh, shoes and, uh ... [SIGH] huh, it's crazy.
