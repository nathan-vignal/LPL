R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Omar.
L:  Uh, my name's Patty.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, I guess our topic is terrorism --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how people would react.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you from, Lomar?
R:  I'm from, uh -- it's Omar -- I'm from D.C.
L:  Omar.  Sorry.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So ...
L:  From Washington D.C.?
R:  That's right.
L:  Oh.  So, you probably know how they --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- [LAUGH] how they react.  I -- I usually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- live in Salt Lake City.  I'm in Philly right now.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, just getting ready to start at a job for the summer here.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.  So, um, yeah, I -- I don't know.  I think that people would probably --
R:  Panic?
L:  -- panic.  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I just think that for the most part is a natural reaction.
R:  Yes.  I mean, because of all the stuff that we have had going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- across the world.
L:  Right.
R:  Me personally I'm waiting for something to happen over here.
L:  Are ya?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, 'cause you're in kind of a scary area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think even Philly -- well, downtown Philly anyway -- I'm in the suburbs thankfully.  But I think the bigger cities are all at risk.
R:  Oh, yeah.  No doubt about that.
L:  Yeah.  I really -- do you think personally that you would panic?
R:  That I would panic?
L:  Yeah.  Or that you would be more calm?
R:  Actually, I mean [LIPSMACK], I'd probably be calm about it because [NOISE], I mean, there's really nothing that any of us can do.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, if -- if they decide that they wanna, you know, do something over here they will.
L:  Well, if something happened the thing is I think if I was in the middle of the situation I would be calm and -- and just be able to try to do something, you know?  I mean, I -- I -- it's kinda like a shock type of thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, I'm a nurse and so I think it would just kick in, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that right?
L:  Just start doing things, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I just think it would be sort of a natural reaction, um ...
R:  I mean, I do anticipate something happening.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  There's too much stuff going on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for it not too.
L:  Right.
R:  And now they're bombing other places, you know, in other nations [LIPSMACK] and after, you know, the war on Iraq, Saddam and his buddies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they all know he's out there.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'd be surprised if there isn't some kind of retaliation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of it.
L:  Yeah.  Well, not only that, but it's just still the ongoing, um, Middle East thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they're all so angry about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I think as long as that's not resolved there's just -- there's a lotta [inaudible] to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and so -- and -- but I -- you know, I think that if something hits, you know, a bomb hits or something that people are gonna -- you know, they're gonna panic and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just like they did at the time it happened.  I mean, most people -- people got out, the calm people got out, but there were people that panicked as well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  I think -- I think that's human nature to just [LAUGH] kinda freeze up and not -- not know what to do, you know?  And there maybe n- nothing you can do either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, if it's already happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a bomb's gone off it's, you know, pretty bad news at that point.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I mean, well [COUGH], the United States we only -- we only see what they let us see.
L:  Right.
R:  And as far as terrorism, I mean, I feel for all the people who died, you know, in the World Trade Center on September eleven.  [COUGH]  But the United States by no stretch of the imagination we're not angels.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, the United States is crooked.  You have to be to be on top.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's -- there's -- there's no way ...
L:  Well, I think there's a lotta things that go on that we never see.
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  You know?  And -- and maybe we shouldn't see it all because if we did for one thing we'd probably panic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] -- and, uh, you know -- and that of course they can't always give away all their secrets --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, because they would risk, uh, security.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I do too -- I think there's probably a lotta things that -- that go on.  There's probably been a lotta close calls too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that we're not even hearing about --
R:  I'm sure.
L:  -- um, that they're stopping and, you know, I mean, it would be nice to think they could stop 'em all, but I just don't think that's gonna ...
R:  No.
L:  I think eventually it's gonna happen over here just like it happened in other places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I wish it didn't [LAUGH], you know?  And -- and you kinda worry.  I mean, you get that kinda panicky feeling.  I remember when it was just going on and when they were saying that -- that they thought that they might do attacks on the subways and different things, and my daughter was pregnant with our first grandbaby at the time and -- and taking the train into downtown Philly every day [LAUGH] and I just remember just almost feeling panicky for her that I thought, you know, I didn't want her on a train --  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, going into the city like that, you know?  Thinking that -- that something could happen.  But, uh ...
R:  It's quite possible.
L:  But the thing is too you can't stop your life --
R:  This is true.
L:  -- and you just have to keep -- keep living your life because, um, you know, you can't just sit and wait for the other shoe to drop.
R:  [LAUGH] Y- yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  And eventually -- I mean, there's a lotta -- you know, the war on Iraq there was a lotta nations that didn't necessarily agree with the United States was doing.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, the other thing going on with North Korea and South Korea --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  I've even read articles, you know?  I think its North Korea.  I could have it transposed, but I believe its North Korea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, saying if the United States sticks their nose in it there's gonna be a nuclear war across the world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we -- we have I guess, hm -- how can I say? -- made ourselves like the police of the world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's not good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because a lotta people are angry --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, at the United States for what we have done.
L:  Right.  Well, and we try to watch out for the underdogs and protect people, but then there comes a point in time when you wonder, you know, we're doing this to the -- almost to the detriment of ourselves --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and our own people and, so, you know, uh ...  But then you have countries like France who are just like [MN] -- I mean, they're like [inaudible], they don't wanna do anything, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they want -- they want all the benefits, but they don't wanna -- they don't want any of the, um, hardship.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, our country has looked out for them for years.  I mean, we -- after the world -- the wars we got involved in World War Two, we -- we helped their country rebuild, we did all these things for them, but they don't seem to be thankful at all.  And that's the thing that kills me, it's like well, if they -- if these people don't really seem to have any gratitude towards you when you do all these things [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe -- I mean, even in Iraq it's kinda like "Okay, you came, you did it.  Now get out".  [LAUGH]  And you just think well, maybe we shouldn't do so much, you know, because we take big risks --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- at um -- for -- on the -- the side for all these people and they don't appreciate it anyway [LAUGH], you know?
R:  This is true.
L:  They kinda want our money and they want us to do things, but then they don't really -- then they hate us on the other side --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I don't know.  I just think -- think our country -- because it -- it worries you that -- that there's gonna be something else going on.  I mean, you look at Switzerland and they're very neutral and they're never threatened, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  And this is true.
L:  They can just -- they just -- of course, they're a little country and they're not very powerful or rich like we are.  But, um, you know, they just kinda mind their own business and nobody expects them to take care of anybody else and they're not threatened in any way.
R:  Mm.
L:  So [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  But the whole thing [COUGH] -- I mean, we're spending a lotta time and lotta money trying to hunt down a couple of people.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  I mean, no matter what we do it's not going bring back the people who died, you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- on September eleven.
L:  No.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 'Cause actually, I mean, what we're doing is just bringing -- bringing about more death --
L:  [NOISE] That could be. 
R:  -- and more destruction [LIPSMACK] and because now -- I mean, I watch it now to the point where we're just searching all across the world looking for anyb- anybody who we believe is involved with anything that has anything to do with terrorists.
L:  Yeah.  Although it'd be nice to think we could wipe out all the terrorists that --
R:  It's not gonna happen.
L:  -- that there are.  No.
R:  It's not gonna happen.  Like this -- this war on terrorism is never ending.
L:  And I think they're gonna just get more insidious in the way that they do things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  As a nurse, I mean, the thing that really scares me is the bio -- you know, the bio terrorism, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you look at the way people panicked over the S.A.R.S. thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you know that if something like that happened there would be mass panic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and maybe even people hurting each other thinking -- you know, trying to -- thinking they were gonna protect themselves, you know, and that someone was endangering them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I could see just, you know, people even harming each other just outta panic, um, because they did that in China.
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, they were killing animals and --
