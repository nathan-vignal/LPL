L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name's Lindsay.
R:  Hi, I'm Brittany.
L:  Hi, Brittany.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um, I'm -- I'm calling from -- or, uh, my home is here in Burn[?] County in -- in, uh, California.
R:  Oh, okay, I'm in Florida. [LAUGH]
L:  Florida, okay [LAUGH] opposite ends of the country.
R:  Yes, across the country.
L:  Cool.  So, the topic, I was just listening t- -- um, is criminal, um, court -- court cases that are shown on television.
R:  Yes.
L:  What do you think about that?
R:  [SIGH] I think it brings the public into it a lot and sometimes maybe more than necessary.  But it gives people like you and me, uh, something to talk about. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure. [LAUGH]
R:  That a lot of gossip all around the world probably when they do that.  Um --
L:  Have you ever watched one on TV or gotten involved with it?
R:  O.J. Simpson was the biggest one. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  I -- that's what comes to mind for me too.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess that was sort of the benchmark for ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- court tr- -- court on TV.
R:  Um --
L:  In fact, didn't it kinda launch a few lawyers TV careers [LAUGH] I think?
R:  I think so too and also those, uh ... smaller shows, um ... [LIPSMACK] uh, I can't even think of -- Judge Judy and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um, you know all those -- the little shows that are on just daytime TV regularly that they show the smaller, um, cases but those, I think, are kind of ridiculous actually.
L:  Right --
R:  Those --
L:  -- and th- those aren't -- I don't think those are very indicative of what really goes on in --
R:  No, [LAUGH] no.  
L:  More like a Kangaroo Court.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um --
R:  Um, what do you think about 'em?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think they have their place too.  Um, uh, you know, although I wonder if it's somehow corrupts the process a little bit because everyone is conscious that it's -- it's, um, being played to the TVs and -- or played -- played for the public.  Uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I know my impression was -- and it's a little bit lo- -- you know, fairly long ago now but it seems to me that the judge in the O.J. Jim- -- O.J. Simpson trial was a little bit intimidated by it all.
R:  Mm.
L:  It kinda got to be ... w- um, bigger than -- than, um, life and ... and whether or not it was really ... I don't know.  There's a me- ... loose ends that ki- -- that -- that whole thing [LAUGH] gave rise to.
R:  Yeah, and you know, i- also could it possibly, um ... turn a lawyer or, uh, anyone involved in the trial into an actor?  [LAUGH] You know, could --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- could they be acting because they know how ... um, much in the public eye it is.
L:  Uh-huh.  Absolutely.  Well, I'm trying to think of a -- w- other high profile cases.  There was here in, uh -- in, um, California there -- the- there was a case that, um, I don't know if it was shown on TV live and people got into that but I know it was excerpted on the -- the news a lot about the, um, dog mauling case.  When the young woman, um, soccer coach from ... [SIGH] was mauled in a San Francisco apartment by neighbors down the hall.  That was on TV a lot too.
R:  I don't --
L:  They -- they --
R:  -- remember that.
L:  -- subsequently made it into a ... you know, as a Law and Order.  I guess that happens a lot with Law and Order but they'd ended up being, um, made into a Law and [LAUGH] Order episode.
R:  Yeah, i- --
L:  The whole thing.
R:  -- sometime it seems like, um, the ones that are televised, i- it's things that happen everyday but you know, one case on that topic is gonna get nationally recognized but a lot of times I think that ... the things that are on, especially if it's someone who's famous.  Um ... and then, you know, everyone else that wants to know what's going on with their case and then that gets -- that's the one on TV but it's happened a million times before.  You just didn't know about it.
L:  Right, exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Like, dog mauling.  I mean, that's ... I'm sure that [LAUGH] happens all the time but --
L:  Oh, thi- -- well, in this case she was killed.
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Oh, yeah, it was horrible.
R:  Okay, I didn't know that.  But --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  So, it --
R:  -- that definitely deserves some attention.  Do some of -- [SIGH] how do you feel about -- do you think that all of the ones that are televised, um, in nationally shown are worthy of the attention?  Or the people who are involved are worthy of that attention?
L:  It's sort of li- -- it's like a chicken and egg situation.  Is that what you're suggesting?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Where -- where it gets all the attention because it's -- it's presented to us and then, you know, it kinda becomes a self fulfilling cycle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they wonder -- I don't know ... but I wonder if it, um ... changes the way ... um, an attorney would present the case because they know they need the public support also.  And it's, you know, it's not just like jury is the -- everyone watching.  It's -- I mean, they're gonna hear about it.  It's gonna be in the news for a long time.  It's ... you know, we might all be making the decision of what's gonna happen but, um ... everyone knows so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the attorney's -- a lot more pressure on an attorney ... [LIPSMACK] I would think.
L:  And it also, if for any reason, um, you know, the cases be- -- do acquire such a high profile you wonder how on earth a -- an impartial jury can ever be impaneled.  Some of, like -- in order to get someone who's not completely already aware of what's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what all the issues are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but at least to have -- have been exposed to all the issues, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, in order to find somebody who's not gonna get into all that would be -- have to be someone who is practically comatose and you're not sure you want a juror who's so --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- not in tune with the world that they are not aware  of what's going on around them too.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  
R:  What else?
L:  Oh, I don't know.  Um ...
R:  What the, umm, Lacy Peterson.
L:  Yeah, well, the- --
R:  That --
L:  -- there's a case where I imagine that will definitely be televised.  The- you know, his, um -- the preliminary hearings were all on TV and ... and -- but that's -- you know, that's interesting because that's -- that guy, Scott Peterson has become well know because of what he di- -- because of the crime, not -- his celebrity doesn't, you know, it's not like an O.J. Simpson where O.J. was already a celebrity.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  His, uh -- Scott -- Scott Peterson's become notorious for what he did, or i- if --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if he did ind- -deed do it, but, uh ...
R:  Right.  I haven't kept up as much with that one.  Lately I don't know what's going on or what ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  Well, he's -- he's being held without bail, um, and I guess it's just the- -- it's still working its way through the process.  In fact, they've -- they've, um ... um ... the police investigators have come back to San Francisco bay to do more, like, I think this entire past week they've been searching the bay for more evidence so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, it's pretty grizzly.  I don't know.
R:  It's a sad story too.  
L:  A really sad story.
R:  That one [LAUGH] -- that one's an awful story.
L:  Yeah, and one that I guess ... goes on more often than we realize.  I m- -- you know ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I guess -- I guess that one captured the attention of the public because a combination of, you know, pregnant, eight months, Christmas Eve, um, attractive young woman, y- you know al- -- I mean, it just really -- everybody was hur- -- their hearts went out to that family.
R:  Yeah, and then, um ...
L:  A- and she's from the same town that, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] oh, you know, the young woman who was killed in Washington D.C. that was involved with the congressman, Gary --
R:  Oh, yes, yes.
L:  -- [inaudible] Sh- um, Shu- ...?  What is her name?
R:  Um, Shandra[?] ...?
L:  Shandra Levy[?].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Levy[?]?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's from the same town so that town is ... had, um -- and it's a fairly small, you know, closely knit city out in, uh, central valley of California.
R:  Oh, I didn't realize they were from the same place at all. [MN]
L:  They were from the same place, yeah.
R:  Um, and then I don't know what the outcome of this was but I saw in, um, magazines and on the news the possibility that he had, um -- he was having an affair or had another -- a girlfriend on the side.
L:  Oh, yes.  She came forward.
R:  Oh, did she?
L:  Yeah, she came forward, um, actually fairly early in the process ... when, um ... you know, I think in maybe late January or February she came forward when she realized -- because she, um -- he had lied to her about hi- the fact that he was married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, so apparently she is going to be a witness for the prosecution when it comes to trial. 
R:  Right.
L:  About all of his actions and, um ... but she did go -- she d- did have a ... a press re- c- conference last week saying she's not going to go -- she's not going to say [LAUGH] anything more in public.  She's, you know, she's gonna --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of w- --
R:  And I think that's good though because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, that just puts her in the public eye as well and she's getting criticized because of whatever but, you know -- but it's ...
L:  But here she thought she was having a, you know, reasonably innocent relationship with somebody who [inaudible] one.
R:  Exactly and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a -- you know ... what a shock to someone -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my Go- --
R:  -- to realize the guy you've been dating ... you know, possibly killed his wife and child and had a wife in the first place.  That's --
L:  And who was almost ready delivered a child.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my God, yeah.
R:  That's a big -- and that's a life changing thing that she probably doesn't want everyone to see. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  It would be kind of mortifying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Horrible.  Horrible to think of all those various po- implications.  [LIPSMACK] But, you know, he certainly has sort of been tried in the public press already, you know, and everybody seems to think he's, you know, got blood on his hands.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] [SIGH]
R:  I do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I know.  It's hard not to think that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he's -- he's, uh, acting kinda weird from the beginning I guess.  Uh ... um ...
R:  Have you done, um -- have you been part of a jury before?
L:  I have.  Never, um ... i- one -- uh, a couple of trials.  Once was a drunk driving and once was a ... [LIPSMACK] grand theft.  I guess somebody -- a kid stole --
