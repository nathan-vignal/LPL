R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Barbara Hays.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Hi, I'm Isabel.
R:  Hi, Isabel.  Where're you calling from?
L:  Miami.
R:  Miami?  I'm in, um, Pasadena, California which is, uh, a part of Los Angeles county.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] What's the weather like in Miami.  Is it hot yet?
L:  Yes. 
R:  Hot and humid?
L:  It has been for a long time. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, for goodness sakes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, dear.  [NOISE] Well, I -- I suppose we should get started.  Yes, would you like to begin?
L:  Um ... yeah.  Um, I guess there's, um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the whole issue now with the Lacy Peterson case and that being televised.
R:  Right.
L:  That's quite an issue now.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um ... 
R:  Would you --
L:  I don't know.  I think that if there's too much media involved ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, it's just a big show.  I mean, all public hearings and stuff are public records, I understand that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't know, like the whole O.J. Simpson thing.
R:  I agree.  I agree that --
L:  That was, like, a circus. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I agree that it's too much of a show and I think there are more forces at play in those types of events than is necessary.  For instance, um, I believe that, uh, there are two parties in -- in a trial; the plaintiff and the, um -- and the defendant, correct?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Therefore they each have their representation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then the third party that comes in is the media, the forth party that comes in is politics --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and I think that --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I think both of those, uh, influenced too much the outcome of the event.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that the outcome is just spoiled by these types of things that -- that come in and I think it's of the public's, um ... um, the public's need for hype that wins over the politicians and the media because the media wants to be paid.
L:  I mean, there has to be money involved with things like this.  You know there does --
R:  Quite so --
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and with the public hype and everything, there- there's just ... in -- and all I'm sure boils down to money and politics, you know?
R:  Right.  I believe that's correct, Isabel.  And therefore I think it taints the process and therefore I'm against it as a general rule.  Uh, surely, uh -- surely the excuse that, um, the information is -- is, uh, public provision --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's provided to the public if we seek it.  Uh, I don't think though that that's a reason to have it televised.  Because -- just because we as taxpayers are, um, uh, by law able to find out about these things, the information.  I don't think that -- when -- when, uh, we're told that that's the reason why these ... [LIPSMACK] trials are televised, because it's a public's right to know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't believe that.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's kinda like a cop out.  Uh, I do believe --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- that that -- you know what I mean?  That that's just their excuse.  "Oh, but it's public record so ..."
R:  That's correct.
L:  "-- you know, we can say it".  I agree.  I mean, a- and it's hard.  There's certain public criminal things -- uh, th- criminal files that should be public, you know, like, knowing if you have a sexual offender in your neighborhood.  Those --
R:  Correct.
L:  -- things are good.
R:  Right, that's to protect our civil rights.
L:  But just televising these things is not protecting anybody.  It's just making a show of it, you know?  It's --
R:  I agree.
L:  I don't know.  I -- I mean and ... yes, it's the United States.  Yes, we have freedom of the press and all that, but I -- I just think that maybe it's taken advantage of sometimes.
R:  Well, I agree.  I think the media, um ... we -- we all watch TV [LIPSMACK] and, uh, and advertisement pays for most of television.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think there's a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of a lot of people that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- want the money and very simply, people want the money.  The media wants, uh, the big -- the big time people on the media are -- are always trying to s- -- are always striving for the big story and I think that all of that overshadows the in- -- the integrity ... of the trial.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  I mean, look at the judges.  They -- I mean, I think most of them enjoy being on TV.
L:  Oh, yeah, and the lawyers.  Please, the publicity they get --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as being the whole -- the high profile lawyers --
R:  And --
L:  -- people wanna hire them and pay them big bucks.
R:  A- and it becomes entertainment and --
L:  Which it shouldn't be entertainment.
R:  Correct.  It becomes entertainment.  It sh- --
L:  You know, because it's somebody's life or ... or something, you know?
R:  So, yes, when we see it on TV -- that's a good point, Isabel.  When we see it on TV it -- it almost takes on a, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Hollywood.
R:  -- a cartoon type -- just a -- like a show, an entertainment.
L:  Right.
R:  Instead of the real thing and so we, as viewers, become desensitized to --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- the critical issues, don't we?  And --
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- therefore we become more accepting.
L:  It turns into a game of show, uh -- let's bet and see if he gets guilty or innocent, you know, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I mean, I remember that during the O.J. Simpson thing; that going on.  [NOISE] Okay, is he going to be guilty or innocent and people thinking, you know --
R:  It's like a page turner, isn't it?  It's like a novel that you watch -- that you watch made for TV.
L:  It's just Hollywood.  It's just like a Hollywood movie, like ... or opening a book by, um, what's this guy?  John Grisham, you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  That ki- -- you know, and -- and it's just not taken seriously and ... I don't know.
R:  And -- and I look at it more as a -- as a pervasive problem in the world where I -- I look at families how the -- the family value system is pretty much quashed by the media.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think this type of -- of airing of these kinds of trials, uh, doesn't help family values.  I think it just -- it just, um, what's the word?  Uh, ma- makes a mockery of something that's very serious.
L:  Right, of the whole --
R:  So, I --
L:  -- judicial system and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and law enforcement, and criminal justice.
R:  I can't think of -- I can't think of any good reasons at this -- at this juncture of airing a trial --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like that.  Of -- of airing these high profile criminal cases.  Can you?
L:  No, not really.  I mean, I understand if it's like ... um, educational purposes.  Maybe Court TV, you know, they -- they show you different proceedings and people watch them, but something that's so high profile, especially like the O.J. Simpson when he was a big football player and everything.  I don't know.  I- --
R:  Right, I [COUGH] --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- I almost look at it as if it's, um, a- as if they're, uh, they're, um, toting pornography by -- by putting it on TV and making a show of it.  To me it's -- it's just, um -- it's just maligning -- maligning the values in our world and I think the media and the politicians and the moneymakers -- imagine all these executives on TV that make --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- the big bucks.
L:  Right.
R:  They want to proliferate this type of thing on TV I believe --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- because what does it do?  It brings money to the networks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, that's a sad thing and, uh, I just think it's wrong.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, there's nothing good about it.  I mean, there's --
R:  [NOISE] I --
L:  -- I mean --
R:  -- I think --
L:  -- maybe it doesn't to -- it does do some harm.  Maybe not directly too much harm, but at the same time it doesn't do any good whatsoever.
R:  Well, right.  I think --
L:  No good at all.
R:  I think -- I think it does more than just a little harm though, Isabel.  I think it, like -- like I said before, it inures us.  It -- it helps us to -- it -- it -- it forces us to adapt to -- to -- to things that -- that aren't normal.  It forces us to accept things that aren't normal into our daily life and therefore it becomes more normal to us.  The bad things become more normal.  We don't look at the bad things as bad.  We look at them more like they're routine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so therefore I --
L:  And -- yeah.
R:  -- it erodes the values of -- of everyone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Bec- because what is it really?  It's about -- isn't it about money?
L:  Oh, it's totally about money and politics and who's in power and who can influence who and ... I mean, I don't know.  Everybody --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- after the O.J. Simpson trial's like, yeah, that man was guilty.  You know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, and I understand everyone formulates their opinion but ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, maybe he really was.  Maybe he didn't murder the woman.  Maybe he hired someone to do it but he was a really high profile person and ... um --
R:  And -- and we -- we formulated so many opinions based on the back and forth and the bantering.  I think some things should have more ceremony to it.  Should have, um, [LIPSMACK] um, I -- I don't know -- know the other word to use.  Should -- I- it should have more respect, don't you agree?
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  I think that -- I think that --
L:  -- that's cause the judicial system.  It needs to work.  It needs to work properly without this, you know ... 
R:  Without --
L:  -- mockery and ... everything.
R:  -- without all that stuff coming into it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because then everybody's posturing for money, for position, you know, and, um, and it becomes too much of a show for money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't like that.
L:  That's what it boils down to.  Ev- you know, money talks in this world.
R:  And -- and all th- --
L:  Unfortunately.
R:  -- and I'll be the first to say that, uh -- that when these things come on TV and I don't watch much TV, Isabel, but [NOISE] -- oh, my husband's laughing.  I don't.  But he --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- has it on and we have people over and the -- the TVs on often.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, when these things come on, it's riveting, is it not?  I- --
L:  It is.  I mean, it captivates everyone cause they -- they make it so.
R:  Because it's human -- it's human pain, it's human suffering and it's [inaudible] --
L:  Exactly, like I said, it was, you know, somebody's dead.  Somebody got killed, you know, and then they're --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- just making this big show of it.
R:  Yeah, but I -- but I think that this country -- this country being the capitalist society in -- in the worst sense that it is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the -- the -- money is going to rule.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.
R:  You know, money is going to rule these things.
L:  Well, that's why they put tho- ho- pr- -- um, high profile cases on T- --
