R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my name is Jodie and I'm in, um -- near Port Wine, Indiana.
R:  Hi, my name is Tina.  I'm in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
L:  Oh, how's the weather? [LAUGH]
R:  Ecu- it was extremely hot up until tod- -- actually last night we had non stop rainstorms.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's cold here. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is it?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would love to switch with you. 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, they're asking us about online trials, hop- high profile trials.  Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the one that I remember watching was O.J. Simpson.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I think everybody [LAUGH] watched that one.
L:  I think you're right.  Um, and you know wh- -- uh, what I learned from it was that all the DNA testing and the, um, [SIGH] you know, what it takes to -- to put the trial together and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um ... what I -- what blew me away from that is how, um, you know, like, the Tonight Show played up the Judge Ito?  Judges Ito and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and had, um, [COUGH] ... you know made -- made such a, um ... I guess a -- a farce of all of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I know anything --
R:  I feel -- I think that ... they are informative --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in that there are certain things that w- you know, we should be able to see, you know, so we know our own opinions about 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But some of 'em I think are just played for the simple fact of the attorneys wanting the publicity.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Or the celebrity that's involved.  Um, the boy trial is another one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, where we saw portions of that.  I didn't sit down and watch much of that.
R:  Yes, and you know, some of the trials that they bring are long and overdrawn and ... I don't know.  I don't know if I agree with -- that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- we should watch them or not because why not take, you know, a small -- let's say, Massachusetts's girl who's been, you know, raped or killed.  We don't televise those.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  But if there's --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, someone of importance or someone that we've all heard of, then of course we get to watch it.
L:  Mhm.  That's true.  Um ... you know, we -- we got a lot -- or heard a lot of publicity about the -- the, um, what's his name?  Sh- uh, can't think of his name but he's a Kennedy ... type, uh, you know, he's a Kennedy relative.
R:  Oh, about the --
L:  And -- [COUGH]
R:  -- one, like, twenty years ago that got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a seventeen year old girl --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know the first time I saw that it was on [LAUGH] Unsolved Mysteries.
L:  Yeah!  Oh, yeah, you know, and it --
R:  I heard all about it so when the, uh, case actually came up, I was like, wow, you know, we kind of already know about this because they already portrayed it on Unsolved Mysteries.
L:  Right, exactly.  You know, but I think you're right.  I think it -- it depends on who the celebrity is and -- and how much exposure they want maybe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [COUGH] or maybe it's that we sensationalize, or it is sensationalized because of their status.
R:  Mhm.  That's true too.  I've never really looked at it that way.  I always just thought, you know, th- they have a name for themselves but they wanna make a bigger name and here's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the opportunity to do so.
L:  Yeah, well, like --
R:  You know some -- some cases I feel though they really do kinda n- stay away from because I don't think it's fair for, like, you know, murdering of children or the [NOISE] serial rapist of children or something.  That -- to exploit children in their families, that's kinda like, argh!
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I know if I were in this -- if someone touched my boys I wouldn't want the whole world to know about it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  [COUGH] Well, I think -- you know, we didn't see a whole lot of information, um -- well, I shouldn't say that either.  When, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, gosh, I was just -- I just had it and it -- it went blank.  You know, I'm trying to think of -- of some of the celebrities that -- oh, Winona Ry- -- uh, was it R- Winona Ryder?
R:  Her shoplifting?
L:  Yeah, her shoplifting thing.  And [COUGH] boy, a -- a big deal was made about her and what she wore and, I mean, and -- and even just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not even on TV but I mean, like, in, say, People magazine or, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this -- this day she was trying to be the conservative person.  This day she should have not worn this, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] So, it becomes a fashion show, um --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- simply by celebrity and I think it gives that person much more publicity.
R:  Yep.  I think they -- that's -- you know, of course all celebrities want the publicity but if they do something that's wrong ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- there they go.  That's something that they will be discussed about --
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]
R:  -- in all conversations.  It's --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- something you'll always remember.  O.J. --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Simpson will never, ever ... no one will ever forget about what he did.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and --
L:  And see that's the other thing is that we draw our own conclusions.  Guilty or not he was acquitted yet ... he --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, in -- in many people's minds he's guilty as heck.
R:  Yeah, and he's --
L:  And --
R:  -- still being treated that way today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Now he's --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know, everywhere you look he's getting in trouble for something or he's making --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a big fuss about something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you can just tell he was fully for the publicity.  Good or bad, he wanted to be talked about.  He wanted to be known and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he gained a lot more people who liked him and some people that can't stand him.
L:  Right, yeah, and I -- I think as you form your own opinion, I think -- you know, I'm not sure that it ... uh, you know, did it hurt him?  Yeah, he isn't getting the endorsements.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, people wan- wanting to see him -- see his face because when they saw him they thought murderer.  Um, proven guilty or not.
R:  No.  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  You have to lock yourself in the bathroom. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know!  I ha- had this do- door shut and all of a sudden it comes busting through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the door. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's usual.  That's usual.  [COUGH] Anyway, I think, you know, I'm trying to think if there was any that have been on lately.  The only one I can think of is the Blake trial and, um, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she caused so much of a stir by going and -- and talking to people that he even lost a lawyer through that and, um, you know, I thought that was kinda interesting that because he actually opened his mouth, [LAUGH] you know, um --
R:  Now, which one was this?
L:  Uh, [SIGH] what was it?  What's his name Blake?  H- he w- used to play -- play Boretta[?] ... um, [LAUGH] [inaudible] I'm blank on his first name.  I just went blank on it but his wife was killed in a restaurant parking lot.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know that.
L:  Uh, Robert Blake.  Robert Blake.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Well, I can guarantee -- 
L:  I had -- I had Richard in my mind and I couldn't get it out.
R:  [LAUGH] I can pretty much guarantee the new one that'll come to trial and it'll be televised will probably be the, um -- I can't think of the names right now but the husband that murdered his nine month pregnant wife?
L:  Oh, yeah.  La- --
R:  And they ended up fi- --
L:  Uh, Lacy Peterson?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're -- uh, you know, and they're finding the bodies and finding the baby.  That'll be the next one.
L:  [COUGH] That's probably very true.
R:  I can only imagine the --
L:  You know, does he get a fair trial, do you think, if it's that publicized?  You know?
R:  It depends because --
L:  I mean, it's--
R:  -- if you're someone that is an important role in society then there's gonna be nothing fair about it.  You're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- most likely going to get off.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and that's why they all -- I feel that they also go for the publicity because they know that it'll help them ... for more -- you know, the people who like 'em are gonna like 'em even more.  They can get more people behind them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But in someone who, you know, like this guy, killing his wife and the unborn child and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know, all the facts that led up to it that are just too coincidental about him being in the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- same lake and, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is somethi- -- I think -- uh, I personally -- I think they're gonna give it to him.
L:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] understand that they -- they may have found --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, somebody that saw her the day after Christmas, you know, and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I just heard that one and I thought, whoa!  You know a- and there's always a twist and you just never know and I -- I know his, uh, girlfriend now -- his -- she's a- attained a high profile la- lawyer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm thinking, Jeez, [COUGH] first of all, you know, how do they pay for this?  Um, you know, because, o- obviously these guys aren't celebrity, you know, but is gonna be very high profile I'm sure.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, [COUGH] I think the --
R:  And that's sad because her family's just gonna hurt even more and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, to find out that your son in law really did kill your own daughter and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the unborn child.
L:  Right.
R:  They should -- th- -- it was horrible.
L:  Oh, yeah, I agree.
R:  But now they have the Court TV.  Do you get that on your cable?
L:  [COUGH] We do get a portion.  [COUGH] We get some of that.  I do- -- I don- do not watch it often.  Sometimes I find it boring.
R:  Yeah, sometimes, like, some of the trials, you know, when they're going through the evidence or psychol- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, certain parts of it y- it just drags but we have the Court TV and it's just twenty four hours of court stuff  and then, you know, they'll throw in, um, Cops and everything that's related to law.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and it's pretty interesting 'cause you can get most ... that aren't high profile trials.
L:  Right.
R:  You can get --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- them on there too so you can kinda --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- see the average Joe and what he did and is he --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- guilty or is he not?
L:  True.  I like being able to see a process ... of what they go through.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, what the -- what the lawyers do.  Um, and -- and also what [COUGH] the investigators do.  You know, I find that very interesting.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  See, I think it's interesting with the jurors.  When they flash upon jurors and stuff and you --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- get to look at that.  Just their facial expressions and --
L:  [COUGH] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you look at 'em like, are they really gonna give him a fair trial or do they always -- you know, are they already against him?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Or that one looks like he's sleeping! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Like, that lady's --
L:  You know?
R:  -- picking her nails over there and not paying much attention. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know, that could be --
L:  And you really don't know.
R:  -- a matter of life or death.
L:  Mhm.  That's very true.  I think it's -- you know, especially when it's a big name.  You know, the interest is there but, boy, look how long O.J. Simpson went on.  Oh, my gosh, how could you keep interest in all that time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And knowing that these guys were sequestered, they weren't allowed to go home or read the papers or, you know ... [LAUGH] and they were stuck there.
R:  Oh, I couldn't even [LAUGH] imagine that.
L:  I know!  'Cause that went so long and it w- --
R:  And that was a trial that went on for s- -- for ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a very long time.
L:  Yeah, and you know, I -- I think too when it's a high profile an- and it's televised and the expense that goes into that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Who pays for that, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Ye- --
