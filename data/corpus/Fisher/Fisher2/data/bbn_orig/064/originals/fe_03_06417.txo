L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  How're you doing?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  My name's Matt.
L:  My name's Terri.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Um, so our topic is -- is terrorism?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  Ah, have you ever done this before?
L:  No -- yes, once.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, o- okay, I've never done it.  My wife signed me up so [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so, um, ah, this is my first time.  But, ah, well anyway I -- I was in PA and, ah, after nine eleven we -- ah, where I live in Pennsylvania is right by a, ah, a naval, ah, depot and, um, the -- the security was through the roof and lines were all backed up and -- and personally I thought people were starting to lose it.  Um, and so -- I mean, the -- what the -- I think the question was would you stay calm, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  And I mean, personally I -- I mean, I -- I didn't think it was, um, you know, too much of a big deal.  I mean, you know, obviously nine eleven was horrible but I'm just saying, like, personally I wasn't, like, stockpiling food or anything that.  But, um, I thought at least our community reacted pretty severely.
L:  Yeah.  I think, ah, some people had a tendency to panic but I think that because they got out in an orderly manner, that most people did not panic and, ah, I know personally I would not be the kind of person to panic 'cause I've had a couple of emergencies like that in my life, ah, not terrorism but in a fire -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I've always remained calm until after it's all over and then I fall apart.  So, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think my adrenalin takes over.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, I also -- I mean, I think -- ah, they [inaudible] -- I think were -- were you just making reference to the, ah, the color -- the, ah, when they raise it and lower it -- the, ah, what's that -- what's that thing called?  The codes -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  Yeah, the alert.
R:  Yeah, the alert.  I think that's -- that's helpful.  I mean, just because it keeps people aware of the fact that it's, you know, it's basically always a threat and it's always a potential and -- I don't know.  I mean -- I don't know, I mean, do you think that those things are going to die off?  I mean, you know, eventually do you think it's going to be a big deal that it got raised to orange or do you think it'll always -- I don't know.
L:  Well, I think unfortunately the people will become passe about it after a -- 
R:  Right.  That's what I was thinking too.
L:  -- period of time.  Ah, yeah, 'cause we were that way before nine eleven.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think we'll ever go back to the point that we were before nine eleven.  We'll take it seriously.  But, as we get more and more alerts then, ah, people will start to become passe about it again.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is not good.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, have you -- have you been to New York since nine eleven?
L:  N- no.  I mean, I -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- I did avoid a trip.  I was, ah, scheduled to go there, um, in November after nine eleven.  I was a little apprehensive.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, then it was cancelled.  Not because of that but, ah -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I was apprehensive about going.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Ah, we -- a- -- we, ah -- like I said, we live in PA so we -- we were at the Pentagon, um, in -- in -- in New York city both since nine eleven and, um, I mean, I think y- -- we were -- we were in New York, um, fairly close to nine eleven and th- the discussion -- I mean, we were on the subway at -- at rush hour and, ah, I -- I -- I rang my wife and after we got off we said if -- I mean, it was amazing to us how many people, um, had connections to somebody in nine eleven and they were still talking about it.  I mean, it was weeks after and, I mean, everybody -- it -- it was still the main topic of conversation and we even heard multiple conversations of people, um, some -- yeah, it's -- it definitely, um, you know, caught everybody's attention and, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.  It impacted a lot of people 'cause there's such -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a diversity of people that worked in those two towers.
R:  Right.
L:  And so it's just about everybody you know knows somebody that was affected by that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't personally know anyone, it's just -- one of the people that I worked with, um, his brother was there.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And, ah, the -- the company that I worked for at the time, ah, had a -- a bunch of employees there and they all got out safely.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, they did have, ah, one person on one of the planes that, um, died. 
R:  Oh, no.
L:  So, you know, that's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as close as it came for me.
R:  Right.
L:  How -- how about you?
R:  Yeah.  Well, the closest for me was, um, a- -- I -- the church that I go to, um, there's a family in our church who's daughter lives in New York and, ah, she had, um -- she left the house late that day and she ha- -- I don't -- something happened and she had to take a different way to work on the subway -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she actually came up through the, ah, the World Trade Towers that -- that subway exit.  And, um, and by the time she got out of the building she was escorted into a -- into another building and she had to stay there, um, for the rest of the day a- as -- as the buildings fell, I mean, she was just less than a block away from it.  Um, but they -- you know, they -- it -- they hadn't -- the planes had hit while she was on the subway and, um -- 
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and they -- yeah, and they skirted -- but, that -- I mean, yeah, and that -- I mean, that's pretty -- I mean, I'm pretty separate from that situation but that's as close as -- as close as I even knew of anybody being involved with it.  So -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, yeah, definitely -- 
L:  Yeah, it was always amazing -- 
R:  -- a horrible day.
L:  -- some of the stories they had on there where people would -- you know, they di- didn't go to work that day for some reason -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- or they missed the subway and -- 
R:  Right.  I know it.
L:  -- and it's just almost like it's, um, already plotted for you that -- 
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you weren't supposed to be there or -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- something.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I know it.  Yeah, and I -- ah, um, one thing that I was thankful for that -- that, ah, I'm -- I'm a youth pastor and, ah, and Tuesdays are my day off and, ah, and so I was home that day and so my wife was a little -- a little, ah, ah, I don't know if I want to call it -- say panicky or not.  But, she -- you know, she was pretty, ah, shaken by the whole thing.  And so I was really thankful for that -- for the fact that I was able to be there all day long.
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ah, and -- and -- and be able to, you know, watch all the news coverage and all that stuff because that was a pretty big shocker.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was just totally shocking and I was on a conference call.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And ah, you know, they -- they came on the conference call and somebody said they were -- you know, they heard about it coming onto the conference call.
R:  Right.
L:  So, then my boss just, ah, was, ah -- was calling from home and he kept going to the TV and giving us play by play but he didn't in the conference call and I couldn't wait for him to get the conference call.  I wished I could -- -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- find out what was happening.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, ah, one -- the one person I told you that his brother was in the -- ah, worked for the tower -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- he got off the call.  He said, "I've got to go.  My brother works in that tower".
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And he hung up.  And you know, and we're -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- like, "Oh, my gosh".
R:  Wow.
L:  Well, he called later and his brother was on vacation.  So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- luckily he wasn't there.
R:  Man.  Yeah, right.  Wow.  Now, do you live on the east coast?
L:  Um, no.  I live in Florida.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  So, down south, huh.  So, I mean what -- what do -- I mean, you know, here it -- you know, we're like within, um, we're within a radius of -- of Washington, and they had, like, these cer- -- you know, if you're within, um, thirty minutes, if you're within an hour or whatever.  I mean, what -- what is the feeling down there?  I mean, do you guys feel like it's a possibility that a -- that a strike would come down there?  I mean -- 
L:  Well, I think, um -- 
R:  -- do you guys kind of feel like -- 
L:  -- mostly I felt -- the people that I'm around -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- feel that we're far removed from that -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because we're not from a big city.
R:  Right.
L:  And so we feel far removed from it.  But, I have some friends that are, ah, in, ah, Connecticut.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  And they said -- they were telling us how depressing everything was.  People didn't want to go out of their house -- 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and everything.  They were really affected by it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, we were far removed from it and prob- -- you know, we live in a small town so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I didn't think that, you know, that was going to be a -- a place that you would have that problem because we're not from a big city.  But -- 
R:  Sure.
L:  -- I -- I think I would be more concerned if I lived in one of the major cities.
R:  Right.  'Cause I know that my -- my grandmother, she has a house in, um, in Pensacola and, ah, and sh- -- I mean, she lives in -- she -- her -- her home is in Michigan but she had -- she bought -- they bought a house in -- in Pensacola and so they -- they head down there for a couple of months of the year.  And I know that she was thankful to go down there.  Even though she's in Michigan she just felt like it was, you know, just better down there and she -- she liked it and felt more safe and everything else.  So, um, I -- I was just curious on your thoughts on that, yeah.
L:  I -- I think it definitely affected people across the country and, you know, they're more cautious.  But, ah -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- it -- it -- it's the same old thing, though, you never think it's going to happen to you.  It's -- 
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  -- like anything, an -- an accident or anything.
R:  Right.
L:  You never really think it's going to happen to you until something like that happens and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you -- then you can't believe it.
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I mean, another thing that makes more comfortable is, you know, what -- what we're doing with El Qaida and what we're doing with, you know, what we did with Iraq and, ah, you know, I -- I mean, they caught another one today.  So, I mean, I think they said that there's like twenty eight of the top fifty two or something that -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- twenty eight are in custody.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, you know, I mean that -- I -- I don't know, I mean sh- -- I'm not confident or I'm not sure or whatever about Iraq's involvement but, you know, just, ah -- it -- it kind of comforts me that -- that at least Saddam's out of the picture and -- and that they're trying to crack down on that stuff and -- and prevent it that way -- 
L:  I don't think he's really out of the picture.  I think he's hiding somewhere -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I guess that's true, yeah.  
L:  -- and he'll resurface.  Yeah.
R:  No proof yet, right? 
L:  Yeah, but, ah --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think he'll -- I think he'll resurface at some [inaudible] point in --  
R:  I hope not.
L:  -- time.  But, I think they're also more fearful 'cause they know that we've taken all these steps.  So -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that makes them more fearful to try and do something.
R:  Right.
L:  Where before we weren't alert like we are now.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, the world's changed so much.  I mean, yeah, I remember on the news coverage that day on nine eleven, they were saying that this -- this will change the way we live.  I mean, that -- that very day they were saying that.  And, ah, and it -- I mean, it's true.  I mean, you know, it's -- it's so much more prominent now.  I mean, you know, talk of terrorism was minimal.  Ah, I mean, at least I thought, I mean, bef- -- you know, pre -- pre nine eleven -- 
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's very true.  It was -- 
R:  -- I mean, I thought it was very seldom, yeah.
L:  -- something that happened in another country.  It -- 
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  -- didn't happen here.  But, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I remember that when that first plane hit, I -- you know, I saw that, and I'm like, "Oh", you know, what kind of -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- idiot could -- could make that big a mistake -- 
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- and then you h- -- saw the other one, and you say, "Oh, my gosh.  That was --" 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- not an accident".  [LAUGH] --" 
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, so you all of a sudden realise that it wasn't an accident and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And it is -- you know, you -- I just -- you just want to go home and hug your family and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, be with your loved ones -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- 'cause you just -- you didn't know how extensive it was going to be, if there was going to be all kinds of things happening.
R:  Sure.  Yeah, 'cause I mean, yeah, that -- that one plane did crash in PA and so that -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kind of got everybody here scared about, you know, the potential of P- -- you know, if -- if they were caught -- if they were flying over us to get to New York and -- and whatever else.  So, that's, ah, you know, it is amazing.  Yeah.  Hm.
L:  The ten minutes is longer than you think it is -- 
R:  Yeah, it is -- 
L:  -- isn't it?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- [LAUGH] It's true.  Yeah.  My wife -- like -- like I said, my wife -- I think she's either done two or three of 'em and, um, and -- and I -- she signed me up and I said, ah, you know I -- I -- I mean, I said, " [LAUGH] Can't you do 'em for me?"  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, she's not -- 
L:  They're always desperate for male voices.  So -- 
R:  -- she's not home right now.  So -- what's that?
L:  -- I thought about signing my husband up but I didn't know -- 
R:  Oh, yeah -- 
L:  -- if he would do it --
