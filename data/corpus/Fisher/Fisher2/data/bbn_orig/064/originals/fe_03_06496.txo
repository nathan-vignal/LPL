R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, my name is Jim.
R:  Jim, hi.  My name is Mary.
L:  Mary?
R:  How are you today?
L:  Uh, okay, how's yourself?
R:  Very good, thank you?
L:  Glad to hear it.
R:  This is an interesting topic.
L:  Yeah, it's, um ... it's a little specialized though.
R:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah really.  I'm, like, I don't really have ...
L:  There was only one that I remember and that was the O.J. trial.
R:  Yes.  Now, was his televised?
L:  Yeah, it was televised.  I saw quite a bit of it.  I remember it.  It was a flo- -- they made a circus outta the whole thing.
R:  Did they really?  Okay.
L:  Yeah, it, uh ... the, um -- the defendant -- the defense counsel eventually wrote a book ... on it and, um ... so did the prosecutor.  The woman; I forget her name.
R:  Yes.  I forget her --
L:  I don't see any reason for ... I don't know, it's, um -- you get enough news in the newsp- -- in the newspaper.  They give you the highlights of it.
R:  Yeah, except I don't believe everything I -- I read or see on the news.
L:  Yeah, well, all you would have seen it of O.J. trial was, uh, the defense counsel making an ass out of the, um, prosecution -- prosecution.  You know, they were -- uh, messing up the evidence and all and, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and it turned into a real circus.
R:  Okay, but then at least you got a chance to see that though with your own eyes?
L:  Yeah, you see it in action and live, yeah.
R:  That would be one good ... uh ... you know, if you were a proponent for it.  I don't really have an opinion either way.  I never really gave too much thought about it.
L:  Well, I just didn't think it was that, uh -- that important.
R:  Right.  I do -- I do agree with you though when you said they made it into a farce with the O.J. because I remember there were big issues on the woman prosecutor's hair and she had to have her clothes a special way and her hair a certain way --
L:  Yeah, for the camera.
R:  -- because it was for the camera and that kinda took away what the whole thing was supposed to be about.
L:  Yeah, the trial, right.
R:  You know, the trial was trivial compared to how this woman presented herself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so I guess in that case like --
L:  Oh, they'll be there with makeup and everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if it goes, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- goes on TV.
R:  Right, like, you're saying is it really even needed if -- if they're just gonna make a farce out of it, you know.  I never really thought about this topic though to be honest with you.  Um, I guess --
L:  No, [inaudible] me with it too.
R:  -- there's pros and cons to -- I guess there's pros and cons to anything. 
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, you live in Pennsylvania.  I just moved from Pennsylvania.  I'm in California.
R:  Oh!  Good for you.
L:  Where abouts in Pennsylvania do you live?
R:  Good for you.  Um, outside of Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, that's where I lived.  Springfield, [inaudible] county.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Kinda know where it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What took you out to California?
L:  Uh, my son's here and I retired, um ... out here.  Looks like I'm gonna stay.  I just took a -- a year's leave so I don't know how long I'll be staying but, um ... I think I wanna stay permanently the way it looks.
R:  Good for you.  Well, the weather's much nicer out there I'm sure.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  God, we didn't -- I didn't even see winter.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's about seventy there.  I s- -- I moved here in September and I've been swimming every other day since.
R:  Wonderful.
L:  Outdoors.
R:  Wonderful, that's nice.  That's nice.
L:  Yeah, you get used to it.
R:  Yes, definitely.  That would -- that would be -- that would be a nice thing.  Wow, cool.
L:  Well, getting back to the topic I don't know if they're gonna approve it any time soon.
R:  I wonder who would have to approve something like that.
L:  Yeah, wh- -- uh, what would be the guidelines for, um ... selecting which trial?
R:  Right, how do you determine --
L:  M- merely for headlines sake or, uh ...?
R:  Right.
L:  Whether it was gonna do some public good.
R:  Right, and that's a good point.  How would they determine if it's a high profile case --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that it should be on and then are you discriminating against the people who it's not being televised for?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And does it really -- how does it reflect upon the justice system?
L:  I didn't know it was a prom- -- I didn't even know they were pushing for it.
R:  Neither did I.  Neither did I.  Like I said, I never really thought about it too much.
L:  Cause they did the O.J. trial and apparently they didn't -- they didn't do, um ... [LIPSMACK] any of the other trials.  There's been some, uh ... I'm thinking of the one lady who drowned her three children.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  They didn't do her trial on public television.
R:  Okay.  U- --
L:  Because she wasn't a big name I guess.
R:  Okay.
L:  I guess that's the only reason they put that one on.
R:  Okay, and would that help or hinder ... which side?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, how would that, uh, you know, the purpose ... of our judicial system is ... you know --
L:  You have a fair trial.  They --
R:  -- to give them -- exactly.  To give them a -- that's what I'm trying to word -- how can I word it?  To give them a fair trial and it doesn't have anything to do with all the other --
L:  Yeah, it's not what the people think --
R:  -- circus stuff going on.
L:  -- it's what the judge decides.
R:  Exactly.  Or the jurors that are sitting there.
L:  Or the jurors, yeah.
R:  You know, how do they feel if they're under scrutiny.  You know, if I was in that jury box I don't know that I would want my face plastered all across the nation for everyone to see and especially --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you get up and say if someone's guilty or innocent, I wonder if that would make you, uh, you know, think twice about your verdict.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, there's so many implications ... if they -- if they wanted to do that.  I don't know.  I don't know how I -- you know, I'm kinda talking myself, I think, into the negative that I don't think it should be televised.
L:  I wonder what prompted to put the -- prompted them to put that one on?
R:  Who kno- --
L:  OJ's trial on.  I just thought it was just a ... all I can see it was the publicity.
R:  Okay.
L:  There was no other reason to have it done -- they didn't do it before or since.
R:  Or since then.  Isn't that peculiar?  Yeah --
L:  He --
R:  -- I don't remember that.  I -- I -- well, I'm -- I work all the -- you know, when you work e- you know, you --
L:  Yeah, yeah, you don't see --
R:  -- don't get to watch the television to even see the prof- -- you know, the high --
L:  Yeah, well, I wasn't [inaudible] -- and I -- I was at work at the time so I saw --
R:  Right, so you could turn on the TV --
L:  -- a good deal of it.
R:  -- and you could, um, you know, catch a few pieces of it.  But I had some serious questions if they wanted to do that.  Just as a -- you know, does it make the trial less fair and less equitable for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a set of people.  And also like, you know, like I said with the woman having to get -- worry about how her hair looked every day and ...
L:  And they would --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- they were definitely playing toward the cameras, both lawyers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They were definitely, um ... they were influenced by the TV --
R:  By the TV.
L:  -- let's put it that way.
R:  Okay.
L:  The way I saw it.
R:  Okay.
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  And probably the jurors were also I would imagine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- unless maybe they're gonna not televise the jury, you know, just have them off to the side.  I don't know.  I -- I don't know.  There would be a lot of, um -- I -- I think my vote, if I had to vote right now after talking to you for a coupla minutes, I would say no, I don't think it should be televised.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if you're that worried about the trial then go there and sit -- you know, sit in the room or --
L:  Yeah, and they -- they can always broadcast the highlights of it on, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- TV news.
R:  Right.
L:  It's the same thing.
R:  I'm just always jaded with the news.  I just really ... only believe a -- a portion of what I read in the newspapers and -- or the -- the media I think just blows everything out of proportion so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
R:  -- I -- I'm always, um, cautious of what I -- of what I hear.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- you see it time and time again proved that they just blow everything out of proportion.  
L:  Yeah, it was like the --
R:  So --
L:  -- uh, the Iraqi war.  [PAUSE]
R:  Uh, you know --
L:  A lot of things were blown outta proportion. 
R:  Yeah, that's what our media does best I think is just, um ...
L:  Yeah.  No use dragging the courts into it.  I don't know, maybe if --
R:  +Exactly.
L:  -- they come up with a good reason, I don't see any --
R:  Right and why would -- and where do you draw the line?  I mean --
L:  Yeah, what's -- what's, um --
R:  You know, do you want a divorce case --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] national.
R:  -- you know or trial, you know, support case.  Should that be televised?  Where -- who -- who's to say ... you know, what's you know --
L:  They have enough trials on television on all the detective shows!
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] really.  Judge Judy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh ...
L:  Yeah, all that sma- -- there's six, uh, judges going with, uh, Judge Judy small claims court?
R:  Judge Jim Bob, they have the Texan, uh, judge and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They got about half a dozen of 'em.
R:  [LAUGH] So, yeah, if you're looking to be entertained you can always just watch Judge Judy if you, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if people [LAUGH] want to see it, you know ... for that reason, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  And they already have that on public TV so I don't know what -- why -- why do they -- are they gonna put it up to the voters or, um ... I don't understand.  They didn't put, uh, OJ's trial up to the voters, they just put it on.
R:  Right, okay.
L:  So, I guess they have the power to do it.
R:  Yeah, I really kinda don't remember that.  That was, uh, pretty -- pretty far back now, right?  About six or seven years ago I guess.
L:  Yes, is it that long?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I guess it is.  [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah, I think -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, they put that one on without asking the public, uh, I imagine what -- what would be holding them up if they were gonna put another one on.
R:  Right.
L:  I- it's a mess.
R:  Right.
L:  It's a wonder another one hasn't been on u- unless it was such a fiasco ...
R:  That could be.
L:  -- with O.J. that they decided not to do it anymore.
R:  Right, and who decides?  Like, does -- I wonder if O.J. Simpson had a say, "I agree to this" or ...
L:  Oh, I n- --
R:  -- you know, did he have a -- did he have a -- a say in it I wonder.
L:  Yeah, I guess he could make a case out of violating his rights.
R:  Yeah, I would think he'd have a real strong case, especially if there's no precedent for it that they've ever -- you know, they've never done it in the past.  I would think he'd have a strong ... argument.
L:  I don't recall -- I don't recall the details of how that trial came about.  I just remember it being on.
R:  Seeing it on.  He had to have agreed.  I -- I just couldn't imagine his lawyers --
L:  He'd have to give us permission, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I think he would give his permission --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because he was a crowd pleaser.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  He already had a -- a -- a national reputation.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I guess he was gonna appeal to the public.
R:  Right.
L:  Use his public, um ...
R:  His image and his --
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] celebrity to fight it.
R: Yes, yes.  Definitely.  Johnny Col- -- what was that guy?  Johnny Cochrane, that was it.
L:  Johnny Cochrane, yeah.
R:  Johnny Cochrane was the, um ...
L:  And if it don't fit you must acquit.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, that's really for the cameras.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] He wrote a book and she wrote a book.  She --
