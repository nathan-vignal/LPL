L:  Yes, my name is Juanita Hudson and I was talking about how many people would react on a terrorist attack.
R:  Hi, Juanita, my name is Sarah.
L:  I think -- hi, how're doing?
R:  All right.  How are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  So, do you think you would panic?  Or be calm?
L:  I would be calm.  Because I'd be prepared for it because what I do, I put God first in my life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I know that with me having a medical background and everything, I've been prepared for s- something like this to happen and, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I read a lot so, I -- I won't panic.  I just remain calm and do what I got to do.
R:  Do you have family members that you would have to take care of?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  I was just talking to a young women -- I did i- -- one of these calls previously and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she was twenty two.  And she --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- said, "Oh, I'd panic, and everybody I know would panic" --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and I thought -- I said, "Well do you know anybody that would have kids or --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- family members they have to take care of?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she said, "Oh, I didn't think about that" so ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They just don't fight.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, we got a generation of people now that -- well, a certain set of people that don't -- don't think about things.
R:  [MN]
L:  They just go from day to day; they don't know what's happening in the world.  They don't listen to the news --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or if something, you know.
R:  Well, I think that, ah, you know, I mean, she was pretty young.  If she was a mother for instance --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she probably would, ah, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- think w- -- it -- yeah, I know that for me, I panic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I don't -- if I don't have anything to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, like, if there is -- if there's something that happens, my husband has a health issue --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and -- and I would need to make sure he was okay, take care of his needs.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've got a pet to take care of.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The other day thee was a --
L:  I got a animal.
R:  Yeah.  What have you got?
L:  [LAUGH] Sh- she's a shoots cox, uh, fox terrier or a toy -- miniature dog.
R:  Oh!
L:  And, uh, Coco, she'll be alert enough to try to keep us together.  She's pretty smart.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I have a pet lizard.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay, there's nothing wrong with that.  [LAUGH]
R:  My husband is allergic to furry things. I used to have two dogs and a cat.
L:  Ooh!  Okay.
R:  But, uh, the other day --
L:  He got a lot of allergies?
R:  Yes.  Like, everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- furry.  And, like, he doesn't just sneeze, he stops breathing.
L:  Oh, my goodness!  Yeah, he got it bad.
R:  Yeah.  Yes, he does.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  So, I noticed the other day we had a tornado and I was fine as long as I had stuff to do.  Like, I -- I made sure my neighbour down the street knew there was a tornado 'cause she doesn't watch the news.  And I put my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lizard in -- in the closet to be safe.  And then when I ran out of stuff to do, that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I got nervous.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, because I --
L:  I guess because I came from a state where there was always tornados of -- from Florida -- and hurricanes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I don't know, maybe I'm just different, I don't know what it is.  But I don't panic on certain things, like, serious stuff.  I just go and assist to whatever I got to do.
R:  See, that's the thing, I  --
L:  And I just remain [LAUGH] 
R:  I didn't have any -- I didn't have anything to ass- -- anything to assist -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- nobody to help.  If I could have gone down the street --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to my, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- neighbor's house and help her take care of her dog.  I'd have been fine. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
R:  Where do you live now?
L:  I live in, um, Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Argh, so you -- you guys get tornados there, right?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I grew up in Missouri, so I grew up in tornado alley.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know about it, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I always had a basement.  Now I live in Florida and I don't have a basement.
L:  Oh, you're in Florida now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's where my daughter went.  I told her it was the hurricane season over that way but she wanted to go.
R:  Is she vacationing?  Or does she live here?
L:  Th- uh, a- um, just mo- -- they just went up there for a vacation for the weekend to Florida.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They went to Miami.
R:  Oh!
L:  Mhm.  So ...
R:  Well, that should be good weather this weekend.
L:  Oh, it might be clear -- it might clear up and it might not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hope it does, you know, so they won't be, you know, worried and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now they panic on different issues but I don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just keep everybody else calm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then now after the stresser[?] is over, do ya -- do ya have a problems then?  Or do you just stay calm the whole time?
L:  Oh, the whole time.
R:  I've noticed that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I'm real calm in a situation like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then after it's over, sometimes I'll fall apart then.
L:  Oh, you will?  Oh.
R:  Uh, yeah, because, uh, you know, my husband falls apart at the beginning. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then he's fine at the end, and then I wait till the end and fall apart --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so at least -- least either one of 
L:  [LAUGH] At least y'all be one or the other, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one started off right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the other one ended [LAUGH] another kind of way.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess as long as we don't both fall apart --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at the same time we're okay.
L:  Well, that's good though if it's like that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well [inaudible] so, like, I had a start in that area, you know, to keep him from being allergic to different allergies and stuff.
R:  Well, the reason we came to Florida -- well, amount of it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we had to go somewhere warm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because the other thing that really gives him a hard time is cold weather and we were living in New Hampshire.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, it's free- -- it'd be freezing there.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And he grew up there and the last --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- winter we were there, you know, those posts people put in their front yard with a light on top?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  The snow was so deep that -- our neighbour has one of those -- and it was buried.
L:  [MN] 
R:  And we said this is our last winter here so, we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, didn't want come to Cal- -- go to California 'cause the air pollution's so bad and we needed to go somewhere warm and I --
L:  Oh, yeah, you can't go there.  No, no.  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, that's how we ended up here.  And I'm a scuba diver --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, I like the warm water.
L:  Oh, yeah.  See I like the water too 'cause I grew up, you know, swimming every day.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You stayed in the water all [several inaudible words] fishers.  You just loved the water.
R:  Do you like Atlanta?
L:  It's okay.  Um, I moved here in this [inaudible] doing different things and working in different areas of distances and I just stuck here but I want -- I really love Florida the best.
R:  Oh!
L:  Because of the, uh, if -- there's more money there in Florida than it is here to me.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now do -- you said you were in health care?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I -- I worked at several of the hospitals in Atlanta --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- installing computer systems at one time.
L:  Oh, ya did, oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you -- do you work at a hospital there in -- in Atlanta?
L:  I do it at home.
R:  Uh.
L:  Home care; I go around to the different houses and do it.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  But I used to work at Georgia check. I -- I stayed there a while and then I went to Emright[?] and I worked there for a while --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I -- I'd rather go to the homes and work with them like that.
R:  Oh, that's a very important service.
L:  Mhm.  Need it.
R:  Do you mostly work with older people?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  I can do any age. It doesn't matter.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I can do newborn babies, preemies[?], ah, --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- older i- -- and younger people, whatever condition it is, I can handle it. 
R:  I've heard that there's more and more of that, um, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people sending workers into the homes of -- when -- when it -- for -- 'specially when somebody's got their first baby.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's good to -- to -- do -- good job here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, lot of people -- when their first born, a lot of people don't know what to do.
R:  Oh, I sure wouldn't know what to do.
L:  So, we, uh, [LAUGH] we have a hospital here that [NOISE] I think it's about a couple of hospitals that send people out for first born babies.
R:  Yeah, that's great.
L:  -- parents, you know, mhm.  And they have people to volunteer for it also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, now you were saying that God's important in your life.  Are you a Christian?
L:  Yes I am. 
R:  I see.  I though you might be.

R:  Oh, of course.
L:  And it just made me stronger.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And different things, you know.
R:  I just -- sometimes I think about people who have no spiritual life at all.  I don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- see how they get through things like -- 
L:  I don't either.  
R:  -- terrorism or whatever else.
L:  I don't know how they make it because you've got to have someone.
R:  Yes.
L:  And he -- he's -- to me he has helped me tremendously.  I'm just like a witness, I could go all over the world and tell different things and different things that have happened to me.  And what he's done for me, you know.
R:  Do you have a church family that you really like right now?
L:  Mhm.  I have, um, one that I'm a member of and two or three churches that I play for.
