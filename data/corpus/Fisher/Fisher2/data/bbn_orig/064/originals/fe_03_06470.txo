L:  Hello?
R:  H- hi, this is Karen.
L:  Hi, this is Theresa.
R:  Hi, Theresa.  Um, I don't think high profile ... people should have their trials televised personally.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I re- I think it should be, um, up to everybody involved and I mean everybody involved.  You know, the -- the person who's being on trial and the -- the cr- -- the, um ... [COUGH] excuse me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I just got choked.
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  But anyway, I just think i- it really depends on -- on everybody that's involved and if everybody can't agree on it then they shouldn't put it -- you know, put it on TV 'cause it's ... you know, it's just a way for the criminals to get publicity over something they've -- they've done, you know?
R:  It -- and see that's exactly what I think.  I think, you know, they're getting their fifteen minutes of fame if they do something so bad that it has to be televised and, I mean, not that they're not already famous but, um, even if it's ... even if it's just more television time, it -- it's just aw- -- I think it's a awful thing, um --
L:  I do too.  It's -- it's like it glorifies everything that they've done.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly and I did watch some of OJ's --
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's what I was thinking.
R:  -- way back when.
L:  That's probably -- that's probably the only thing I've really ... as far as trials go, it's the only thing I ever really watched but I didn't watch it religiously or anything.  I just tuned in every couple of days to see what was going on.
R:  I would too and I -- it w- -- I just got so frustrated with it because nothing ever was being ... changed, you know?  It -- they just drug it out and drug it out like it was a soap opera --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get ratings.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It was almost like to get ratings and, uh -- so I thought it was silly and I think it's -- it is inappropriate.  It's like way back when they didn't want lawyers to advertise in the phone book.  You know, take out big ads.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They would just have their names in the phone book and, of c- --
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  I'm sorry, is that -- 
L:  That's okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um, anyway, uh, and now they do and I -- I just think there's cer- [inaudible] -- I'm sorry, certain professions that need to ... just have a more established decorum than -- I -- I just don't think these things need to be on television, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Also, uh, uh, you know, I thought too that if, um, for some reason there has to be another trial for the same thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- everybody's seen it.  It's gonna be really hard to get a -- a fair trial with -- with, you know, having people on the jury that don't know anything about it.
R:  That's true.
L:  I- if they've seen it on TV.  Just like, you know, like the O.J. trial.  I mean, that was just near damn near impossible just because of who he was.
R:  Exactly, exactly, and so he probably for sure says, "Yeah!  Let's make sure it's televised because then you wouldn't be able to find a -- a jury that could --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- you know, not be dismissed".  [NOISE] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  So ... anyway, [LIPSMACK] um ... I'm not sure what else more to say about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, me neither.  I mean, you know, it is -- I -- I do have to admit, I mean, it -- just like, you know, I watch scary movies and they're based on true stories --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, there is a little bit of entertainment to it, just -- just because you wanna know what's going on and how -- how everybody handles it but, you know, I -- I don't -- that don't mean that I think it -- it should still be allowed to -- they should be allowed to do it.
R:  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Uh, I --
L:  'Cause, you know, every now -- I'll be flipping through the channels and I'll come across Court TV and I might stop for a second but I don- I don't, you know -- I don't really watch it.
R:  Right.  Well, I think those -- i- now Court TV, is that -- is that like high profile or is that more like --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- everybody comes in, you know, with the silly ...?
L:  Yeah, I -- I think -- I'm not positive 'cause I think it might be a mixture of both.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I don't know for sure because I mean they have a lot of other program.  They have like -- they -- th- those cop shows on there sometimes too I think.
R:  Right, well, like I -- there's Texas Justice and Judge Judy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all those things.  
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, I think those are totally entertainment, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and they're all really silly little cases most of the time.  They're not gonna have any big murder trials --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] on one of those.
L:  Yeah, and both -- both the parties have both agreed to be on TV so that's no big deal there.
R:  Eg- eg- exactly and so I think that's fine, but you know, somebody high +profile -- profile like O.J. Simpson or, what's the guy that was ... oh I can't think.  
L:  I know there was a --
R:  He was a Bereta[?].  He was in, um, our gang, the Little Rascals when he was little.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  That guy.  I can't think of what his name is.  
L:  No, I can't either.
R:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] uh -- I -- I just think that's ridiculous to even have him on there, you know?  It's jus- --
L:  And also it gives us, like, the people that watch it, just a totally unreal idea of what's going on 'cause we're not seeing the whole picture.
R:  Exactly.
L:  We're just seeing what's on TV and we're seeing the time -- you know, 'cause we're not gonna watch the whole damn thing.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know, it gives -- we -- we create an opinion on something that we don't know nothing about.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  That is exactly true because I felt people watching the Simpson trial -- um, a friend of mines mother watched it like -- like you said, religiously like you didn't, but she did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she became so [NOISE] absorbed in it and she just felt like, "Oh, you know, O.J. is just an angel.  He's wonderful.  How could they be doing this?" you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... [LAUGH] you would think that, um ... [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I thought he was guilty as soon as they said something and they were -- I mean, the glove and all that other -- [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, I -- I still think he's guilty and I think, you know, his -- his fame and his money got him out of it but, you know, that's just my opinion.
R:  Eg- exactly and that's it, you know?  Um ... 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, um -- I'm sorry, my daughter just came knocking on the door. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I had the three kids come run into my house just now so -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, um, yeah, I think that, um ... that just helps -- I almost think it helps their case because they are celebrities that, you know, public opinion, even -- I don't know.  I don't know how to say it but ... um, I'm just not in favor of it so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't know how much more ... they need us to talk about it [LAUGH] because --
L:  Well, look at all the, you know -- reality TV has become a big thing, you know?  They- they're trying to put real thing -- real life stuff on TV and I don't -- I -- I think they're getting carried away with it.
R:  Right.  Well, some -- you know, a lot of that is -- is set up reality shows.  
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  This has been something that -- that happened and now they're ... coming to trial for it obviously but, you know, like the Survivor and those others, you know, it's a set up kind of situation.  You know what -- w- it's -- you know, where they go and live in somebody's house or whatever [LAUGH] it is, you know, all that is real life but --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- this is just a different --
L:  [NOISE] I think it's getting to the point where ev- -- you know, everything's been done.  All the sitcoms are all about the same.  All the, like, the drama shows are all about the same.  So, now they're really trying to show us other stuff to entertain us.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] You know, we're getting bored.
R:  Right.  But some things I think they just need to remain private.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  So --
L:  'Cause you know, the -- the victims, you know, they ... people are forming an opinion about the -- the criminals and maybe getting a heart for 'em and not realizing the things that they have actually done.
R:  Exactly!  
L:  So --
R:  Exactly, that's what makes me so mad.  You know, here th- -- I mean, they literally get away with murder.  Yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, he's running from the law.  You know, they show all the pictures where he's, you know, speeding through LA interstate -- going back to O.J. Simpson.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, why is he, you know, running away from the cops?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if he [LAUGH] didn't do anything?
L:  Exactly.  If I didn't do it, I'd -- you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'd just stay where I was and --
R:  Exactly, so well, my gosh, you know?  I didn't do anything!
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, anyway, [LIPSMACK] um ...
L:  I think that was just a big joke.
R:  Yes.  Yep so --
L:  But, you know, it wasn't a joke to the -- the victims and -- and that's another thing, you know, people are not even thinking about the families that were left behind.  Everybody's just focused on O.J.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- I think that's terrible.
R:  And here again, I -- I don't know what kinda arrangement is made with the ... being able to cover these things.  Like, if channel whatever's gonna cover the +OJs, you know, do they then pay somebody?  You know, how you pay to, uh or, uh, you know, what kind of financial agreement is going on to be able to be there.  
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know, what money is changing hands.  That doesn't --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know.  There's probably something going on there too.
L:  Yeah, and that makes you wonder about the whole justice system too.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  So ...  Well, I wonder how long we have talked here.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  I wonder if it's been long enough.  Probably not long enough.  I think this --
L:  Well, I -- I've had one -- one other phone call like this.  But it -- it went by really fast.
R:  Yes, I did too.
L:  [NOISE] So this -- you know, the -- my first one.  And but I -- I [LAUGH] -- I sat there and let the other girl do all the talking because I was like --
R:  Oh my. [LAUGH]
L:  It was about allergies or something.  [LAUGH] I don't have allergies.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I had one and we had di- discussed what -- if we could go back in time, if there was one thing that we could do over, what would it be?  
L:  Oh, my!  [LAUGH]
R:  And it was really -- it was -- we had, uh, thought of a really good interesting conversation but --
L:  I bet.
R:  But I can't really ... think of anything else to say about ... criminal trials in -- on television and whatnot, so hopefully they're getting enough from our voices to get whatever they need to get. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We pretty much agree on it too.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  So, that's probably what makes it hard is we agree on it and we're not fighting back and forth on --
R:  [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
L:  -- who's right. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, and you have a valid point.  I- if it -- if all the parties agree ... and that's fine too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it still seems like ... somebody may get more out of it than they need to by being on -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on television, you know, and then they want the movie rights and --
L:  Yeah, I sorta think [inaudible] --
R:  -- you know, the criminals get paid because ... they're gonna have a book now or --
L:  Yeah, there's plenty of people on this earth that do good for others and they don't get recognized for it and then you take a murderer and they get a book and a movie and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, TV series and all that.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  
L:  And it's terrible.
R:  And that do- -- and so this doesn't help the situation either.
L:  Yeah.  And you know, you think about our kids too.  What our kids see on TV and, you know, I really don't want my -- I got a six year old and, you know, I don't -- I don't really want him seeing all that stuff.
