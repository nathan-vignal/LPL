L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hi, this is Elaine.
L:  Hi Elaine, my name is Dana.  [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] And, you know what, I couldn't hear what the topic was. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- think they said that, um, we --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- were supposed to discuss whether we believed people would stay calm or panic --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the case of a terrorist attack.
L:  Oh!  Okay.  [LAUGH] I assume they mean here where we live?
R:  Yes, I'm assuming that.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Well, I think that people would ... [SIGH] probably, uh, the ones in the immediate vicinity would panic.
R:  I would think so.  I'm -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I am trying to imagine -- for example if a building fell on top of me, even if I were still alive, I think I would be extremely claustrophobic, and I would probably be screaming and yelling.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  How could you not?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I suppose it depends on what kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] what should I say -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what kind of problem.  Is it the result of the, um --
L:  The attack.
R:  -- ah, what kind of an attack it is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I guess.
L:  Right.  Right.  So, in other words, like, if there was, um, [LIPSMACK] some, um, uh, toxins found in a water supply.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, then I think then -- a more general population, I think there would be some panic.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think, I mean, if th- -- if there were a bomb that went off or a suic- -- I would hate to be on a plane that was, I mean, like, those poor people who were on those planes several --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- years ago that crashed.  I would certainly --
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- I think I would panic then.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I would hope that I wouldn't.  [LAUGH] I would hope that I would be able to stay calm.  Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't really -- I'm not afraid of death but I don't relish the thought of dying.
L:  Especially in that way.
R:  Right.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  So, I -- I think most people are that way.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  But, uh ... you know, I think also the aftermath of, like, um, say okay, there -- there was a bomb and a building collapsed in a major metropolitan center, then I think the whole nation is -- in a -- as a whole would be a little bit more on edge.
R:  Well, I think we all were after September eleventh.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  But I think, you know, it's kind of died down.  I mean, we're -- I think we're more vigilant, but we're not more on edge.
R:  No.  I don't think so now.  But if there were to be another major attack like that, I think that --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- people would become, um, pretty edgy again.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah I agree.  I agree.
R:  Um, where do you live?  Are you anywhere around a -- a major metropolitan area?
L:  Well, you know, it's really funny, um, I live in a suburb of Sacramento, California.
R:  Oh, my! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And, um, we, ah -- there is a -- a dam that we -- actually it was -- wasn't built -- it has a roadway across the top of the dam and it was originally constructed as a service road.  And as California's pretty bad about preparing for the future, it evolved into a major artery and, um, [LIPSMACK] after the attacks they closed this road because they were afraid they were to give easy access to any terrorism.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They could bomb the -- the dam and then fl- -- in essence flood Sacramento.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it would have to be a very big bomb.  [LAUGH] And they still can have access to it via boat on the water --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] that is -- it -- it -- it's still closed.  And it -- it's caused a lot of problems.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, you know, that's just one -- one way that it's changed our -- our lives here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause, uh, whenever I go, uh, to a place where I would have gone over at the -- we call it the dam road -- [LAUGH] over the dam road, it takes me an extra twenty minutes now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we have to go all the way around and traffic is worse and -- and traffic's just going into little neighborhoods that was never meant to handle traffic, but it's the shortest route to get to where we need to go.
R:  Oh, mhm.  S- -- did you feel threat- -- personally threatened at any time?  After nine eleven?
L:  You know, [LIPSMACK] you know, I didn't.  Um, we, ah, had plans to -- my husband and I -- to go to London for ten days, ah, at the beginning of October.  And we canceled those plans and, um, we had arranged for our children, to each of them stay with a friend and they were so disappointed, they wanted to still spend their week with their friends [LAUGH] so, we ended up going to Las Vegas instead.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause we figured well, you know -- we flew.  I -- I didn't have any problems with flying.  And we flew and everything was great but we figured well, if something did happen, it's still close enough we could drive home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- so, what part of the county are you in?
R:  I live in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I -- I can't say that I ever did feel personally threatened but I will say that I was -- even though it was, you know, quite a distance from me I still -- I was a bit edgy for a while after it ha- -- [COUGH] excuse me, after --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it happened.  [MN] But, um, I -- I think it would be abnormal to ha- -- to be in the vicinity of something like that and not feel some measure of panic.
L:  Yes.  I think so too.
R:  I am a nurse and, I mean, I have been -- I'm not working as a nurse now, but I did -- I have for years, and I've been trained how to help other people but, um, I don't know how I -- in -- in that kind of trauma, I don't know how calm I would be able [LAUGH] to stay --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- even then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the training that I've had.
L:  Uh-huh. So, well, and too, if it were like a -- [MN] a bomb situation, I would be a little nervous that there might be another one going off soon.  You know, instead of just having to deal with the -- the injuries and whatever of the initial blast, um, then I would al- -- I would still be nervous of something else maybe coming.
R:  Well, I think we've been conditioned for that because of the fact that w- -- during that attack, there wasn't just one plane, but there were four.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and so, you know, s- s- since we have that, what, mindset should I say, that, you know, it's happened before and it wasn't just one isolated incident.  I -- I think it would be normal to think that there might be, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- other incidents coming.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  But ...
L:  So, I mean, and I -- it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- just especially poignant right now because they just raised the -- the level again --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to a higher alert.  So, uh, I think even that; I know it makes me a little bit [LIPSMACK] more cognizant, I guess.
R:  Right.  W- When they had raised [NOISE] -- the last time they raised it, um, to a high alert, my sister and some of her children were going to Washington DC on vacation and I remember saying, "Oh, don't go there now".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because I -- I don't know, I just feel that that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- probably is a -- they were vulnerable there, I felt.
L:  Uh-huh.  Ah, so, did they go ahead and go?  Or did they --
R:  They went.  [LAUGH]
L:  Did they?  [LAUGH] 
R:  And they came home without any problems so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it wasn't -- but it -- it just made me a little uncomfortable to know that they were going to Washington DC.
L:  Sure.
R:  Because I -- I --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- think that that is probably the most likely place in the nation to be hit --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if it could be.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, yeah, that's, you know, I was really thinking that they might -- might try to strike some other targets initially -- initially, uh, other targets across the county to try to create a more, um, panic --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the population.  But either they didn't plan it or it -- it di- -- just didn't happen.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:   But it kind of surprised me.  I -- as organized as it was.
R:  It was organized, wasn't it?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yes, it was.  And, uh, you know, with the -- the bombings that have occurred recently and then the -- the guys that are -- are all of a sudden missing, yeah, it do- -- it mak- -- I know the [inaudible].
R:  Mhm.  And with the threats, um, ah, you don't know whether those threats are actually coming from Bin Laden or -- or if it's just, um, someone --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- mimicking him, but nevertheless it is -- it's a bit disquieting I think.
L:  Yes.  Yes, it is.  It certainly is.  So, having it -- has it chan- -- has -- has your life changed much since September eleventh?
R:  No.  I -- very little, uh, personally.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  I, um -- I don't fly much.  I have taken one trip by air since then and of course the -- the security was much higher than it had been previously.  I noticed that of course, um --
