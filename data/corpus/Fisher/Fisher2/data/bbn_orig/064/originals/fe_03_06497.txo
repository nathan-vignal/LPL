L:  Hello.
R:  Hello
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Well, I'm -- I'm David. I'm from Hollywood, California.
L:  Oh, hi, David.  I'm Helen.  I'm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, hello.
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] this side of the country.
R:  Yes, it's a long way away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I guess you're close to where the study is coming out of Penn State though. [NOISE] 
L:  Yes.  I think it's actually the University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, is it?  I'm sorry --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my wife -- my wife signed up -- signed me up for this, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- this is actually my first call so I'm a little, ah --
L:  Oh, mine too. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, is it really?
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I did sign my fiance -- tried to sign my fiance up, but, ah, so far I haven't gotten him [LAUGH] -- gotten --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- him to agree. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I -- I seem to be, ah, in -- in her chat groups but they don't seem --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to be get, ah, too many males to sign up for these things.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But -- but I've been threatened with violence, so, I thought, "Okay". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Hm.  So, that worked.  I'll try that. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tell him, you know.  He's out if -- if he doesn't -- if he won't sign up.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, did you want to start or did you want me to start?
L:  Oh, you can -- can[?], yeah.
R:  Okay.  Um, I guess the topic is, um, televised trials.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do we feel it's right and have we seen any?  So, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I -- I think -- might as well, um, televise them.  It -- it seems to be -- it's -- it's a public thing anyway --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I believe that, ah, unless there's a concern that's it's going to cause some type of, um, public outrage or outcry, being that I'm the Los Angeles area, you know, we had the -- the riots and all, but, um --
L:  Yeah, what about the O.J. trial, did you watch that?
R:  I did actually, well, I watched parts of it. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It went on for a really long time, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, to my --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- my father's --
L:  Do --
R:  -- real big in that -- that Court +TV -- I don't have cable so I don't -- I don't get to see the Court TV.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And yourself?
L:  Oh, my -- well, my grandparents had it on, like, all day, every day.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, at the -- at the time of the trial I was actually a nurse and I'd be, you know, working during the day and people would have it on in the hospital and [SIGH] I -- I feel like, in his -- in that case, though, I think that, ah, [PAUSE] I think the cameras were detrimental to the case.  Um, I -- I really think that [PAUSE] he got off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I think that was -- yeah, partially it.
L:  In that, just wa- -- like, in the beginning of the trial, um, Marsha Clarke, you know, sh- -- her whole appearance changed, she had her stylist and I disliked -- everybody was playing to the cameras.
R:  Yeah, it became more of a, yeah, oh, like a --
L:  Like a media circus --
R:  -- televised political type, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- further my own career type of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  Which, I guess, was because it was the first media celebrity type of -- of trial, I guess.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now it's kinda getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- commonplace out here. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  And then the -- no, I was just going to say, I -- I -- and personally, if it were me, I wouldn't want my trial broadcast, if I were on -- up for ...
R:  Oh, yes, of course.  That's totally different.  That's me.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  No, no, no.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, I mean, and -- and I, like I said, I do understand that there are certain times and under certain conditions that you wouldn't want, like, any type of murder trial that, like, has anything to do with children, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, like, totally grotesque type of -- of testimony is going to be going on.  And I -- I totally understand not -- not displaying and I -- I'm not at all for, you know, televising any type of, you know, capital punishment.
L:  No.  Yeah.  
R:  So ...
L:  Me neither. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, for the minor stuff I think maybe [inaudible] might help to alleviate some of the people from becoming criminals, knowing that they're going to have all their cases televised, and people can watch them and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and see what's going on and -- and they become almost, like, celebrities in their own right, for a brief period of time and they're not going to have that anonymity if they get off, like, people are going to know what's going on.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE] Yeah, then, on the other hand, I guess you have people who are -- who would do it in order to get on TV, and it might be the opposite extreme too.
R:  Wh- what [inaudible]. 
L:  Yeah.  Did you ever see the, ah -- did you see the, um, movie or the show, Chicago?
R:  I -- I didn't actually, no.  But, I -- I -- I know the premise of it but I haven't --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- haven't seen it.
L:  That's kinda the theme where, how the med- -- how the, um, [LIPSMACK] the court -- the lawyers in the court, everybody was playing to the audience, you know, playing to the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the girl --
R:  You know, I didn't -- I didn't even think of that aspect of it before, I guess.  I'm not that kind of a [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that kinda -- that kinda person.
L:  Yeah, we're cynical back East, here. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I -- I'm just a -- the nice -- ni- naive guy who thinks, well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, that will deter criminals, not realizing that people would want to actually, like, do it to get on TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I guess, I -- I should have thought that because out here we don't, ah, televise any -- the news won't carry any murders or anything that are done by, ah, the gang bangers.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  So, because for that very reason, they don't want them to be doing it to get televis- tele- TV time.  [inaudible] 
L:  How do -- how did the people in California feel after the O.J. trial was televised?  Do you think it -- the general idea was that it was a really bad idea or the general feeling it was a bad idea?
R:  Um, you know, I -- I don't really know, um, off hand.  I -- I came out here about that time.  I'm actually from back East.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I'm -- I'm from Florida myself, so.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm from where he lives now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where he's hiding out.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, the general consensus was, I guess, just [LIPSMACK] that it was a sham of a trial and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, everybody kinda focused on the whole aftermath rather than the -- the trial itself.  I don't -- I don't know -- I haven't heard anybody talk too much about the fact that the trial might have -- I mean, the televising of the trial caused many of the problems out here.  I think it was more along the lines of the -- the outcome.
L:  Right.
R:  [PAUSE] If I'm -- if I'm not --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- getting my facts confused, which I might be. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, it's ok- ... [LAUGH] Phew.
R:  I'm [inaudible] kinda just got in from work so I'm still a bit scatter brained over here.
L:  Oh, that's okay.  I was actually dozing on the couch when [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the phone rang.  [LAUGH] So, this is kinda a hard topic to discuss for ten minutes? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, it -- yes, it is.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, so, how did you find out about the study?
L:  Ah, just in, um, local newspaper.
R:  Oh, actually -- they actually broadcast in the newspaper over there?
L:  Yeah, it was a -- it's a little paper just called The Metro.  It's a free paper that's given out in the -- in the act- -- in the subway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And on the, ah, public transportation, the buses and stuff, and it was just a little ad, um, so I signed up and ...
R:  Ah.  
L:  Here you are.
R:  And this is -- this is your, ah, first call, too, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so, you know, we -- are we -- my wife found out about it.  She does a lot of online searching for, ah, like, the rebates and, ah, surveys and those type of things.  I don't know if you do that type of stuff?  Where she --
L:  Oh, sometimes, like some, um, control focus groups. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] focus groups. [PAUSE] 
R:  Oh.
L:  So, and I did a focus group with this same paper that advertised this study, actually.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  A while ago.  So, I'm always checking it to see if there's anything else.
R:  Huh.  Yeah.  I understand.
L:  So, how did you -- how did you end up in Calif- -- in California from Florida?  Rather talk about that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, I know, it's -- it's hard to talk about the topics.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I, um, my company actually transferred me out here.  I -- I work for a lighting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and sound company.
L:  Ah.
R:  And, um, I was in --
L:  [inaudible] Okay.
R:  -- I -- I was in Orlando, Florida and then, ah, we got a couple of offices out here and they transferred me out here to open up some of the offices --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and fell in love with the place and, ah, I -- it's a lot different, I -- I know -- I -- I -- I don't know if I've ever been to Philadelphia but, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- actually, yes, I have.  When I was a -- a child.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's sorta like -- sorta like Florida in regards to, like, you don't have a lot of differences around you.  Like here we've got the desert, the ocean, you know, mountains --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with snow.  It's -- that's, I guess, coming from a place where it's -- everything is kinda the same, especially in Florida where everything's flat.
L:  Yeah, here -- right in Philly actually, we have, you know, the Jersey beaches are like an -- a little over an hour away.  Then you have the Pokeno[?] mountains which are less than -- a little over an hour away.  And then we have --
R:  Yeah, okay, so --
L:  -- a -- so, we have kinda in the same thing.  We have a little bit of everything.  We don't have desert but --
R:  Yeah, but you -- you -- see, you get the snow. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, actually, that --
R:  That's the one thing I -- I can't --
L:  -- really hate it.
R:  -- I can't -- I can't imagine living in a place where it snows.  It just --
L:  Yeah, we're -- my fiance -- I was actually originally from Arizona.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, we're looking at the -- we're looking to go some place warm soon -- real soon.  I work for a -- a university here and my children will go to, um, college for free.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I'm divorced and I have two older kids.  One fifteen and one thirteen so I'm just trying to hang out long enough --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for them to get through school and get their free college tuition and then, hopefully --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- head some place warm. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you know, I have [inaudible] -- actually, I have a lot of relatives up in, ah, the Pennsylvania area.  Um, I have a -- I have a -- an uncle, I guess an uncle in law, that's, ah, athletics rector for the University of Scranton[?].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, I -- my aunt did the same thing, like you're doing for your kids.  She, you know, she went through the whole -- took her, like, twenty years, she took, like, one class a semester --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but she graduated, you know, got her degree, 'cause it doesn't cost anything, like, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, that's the only way to do it these days.  But --
L:  Yeah, I'm on the twenty year program too.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have one -- three credits to go. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was a bit, you know, when she graduated at twenty, she -- she took one credit, ah, a semester but she graduated valedictorian from her graduating class.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, she got to make this -- because, you know, you take one -- one credit every -- too, it's a lot easier to get the -- the higher grade.
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.
R:  But, ah, then I -- I -- so, you're -- but you're a nurse already, ah, so?
L:  I -- well, I was.  I was a nurse for five years and then I went to computer school and that's what I do now.  I'm a programmer, a systems analyst.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Um, er, yeah.
R:  Hope you weren't --
L:  I got tired of nur- --
R:  -- in any of those dot coms, were you?
L:  No, no, no. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Just [inaudible] university.
R:  Ah, oh, that's good.
L:  They tem- --
R:  That's -- that's [inaudible] university, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- I mean, that's a nice stable job, there, so.
L:  Yeah, it's for Temple -- I don't know if you've heard of Temple University?
R:  Um, I actually -- I have actually heard of Temple.  I don't know that much about it but, ah --
L:  Well, Bill Cosby went there, that's our claim to fame.
R:  Ah, did he do the commencement speech?  Was that --
L:  Yeah, he does it every year.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I saw -- I think I saw that on the news hour.  I mean I -- I heard he did, like, three or four this year, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I saw him just on the news, the other day, doing a commencement speech and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- maybe it was Temple?
L:  It probably was.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  So, are you having nice weather?
R:  [inaudible] yeah, that's the one thing I really like about out here.  It's compo- -- even to Florida -- I grew up in Florida so I just thought, you know, it's hot, humidity, two weeks --
L:  Mhm.
