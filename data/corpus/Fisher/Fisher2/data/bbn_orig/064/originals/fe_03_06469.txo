L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hm.
R:  Hi, my name is Mike.
L:  My name's Shannon.
R:  Hi, Shannon.  Where you from?
L:  Hi.  I'm from Phoenix, Arizona.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Detroit, ex Minnesota.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Okay.  So, I guess it's about high profile criminal cases then?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do you feel about it? 
L:  [NOISE] Well, I don't really watch them.  I remember, like, the last one I really watched was the O.J. trial.
R:  Yep.
L:  But that was when I was in school.  And, I remember I -- I [inaudible] -- I remember watching it in history class.
R:  Okay.
L:  And -- and I don't know why we were watching [LAUGH] but we were.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And so, I think, because it was -- like that was my first, like, major criminal case, like I actually watched, like, from the beginning all the way to the end.  But, like, other than that, like, I'll pay attention to them, like, um, Robert Blakely.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, I -- I'll hear about it on the news and stuff but I won't pay too much attention to it.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I know, it's -- I watch on, like, Discovery or Learning Channel they have, um, like, who was those guys up in California that shot their parents?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Menendez --
R:  Um, Menendez, yep.
L:  -- brothers.
R:  And if I catch it on, like, Discovery or something I'll sit and watch it and see what happened but then I don't make it a point, I guess, to tune in to it and ...
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- I guess those people who do pay a lot of attention to it but -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I dunno if it's because they're celebrities that they pay so much attention to it or ...
R:  Right.  Ok- --
L:  You know, like Winona Ryder and shoplifting and like that.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, to me that --
L:  I don't -- I don't really care, you know, like [LAUGH] --
R:  [COUGH] Whatever she did, she's just another person and so what if she's a star or whatever?  That shouldn't have to -- I -- I don't think it something that -- you know, if some people really care what the heck happens, I guess, but I -- it's not that big of a deal to me, I guess, to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sit and watch them and what they did and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, some other ones that aren't real high -- high profile people, or whatever, that have h- -- done stuff and [COUGH] -- and watched their trials on -- on them, are actually more interesting than [NOISE] -- because they were s- -- they weren't a celebrity, you know -- what they had going on, I guess, so.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, plus, I don't know really what they consider classify --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- as celebrity, you know, 'cause, like, people become celebrities now because of the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because of their trials.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like, um --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  Like Scott Petersen.
R:  Yep.  Yeah.
L:  In the Laci trial.  I mean, he's now a celebrity in, you know, in a different sense of the word, but --
R:  Yep, but he still is and -- and, ah, Lorena Bobbitt, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She turned her husband into a celebrity basically, and, ah, that's [NOISE] -- but I think there's people out there that really, um, makes them feel about themselves or what it might be, but ... [PAUSE]
L:  I -- I don't think -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- I don't think it really should matter, you know, they mainly ... [PAUSE]
R:  Like, it's just --
L:  Like, there's court TV where all they have on there is, you know, court stuff --
R:  Cases.
L:  -- and whatnot.
R:  [NOISE] Yep. [NOISE] I think it's just -- it's just the voyeurs among people, I suppose, to see, you know, that all celebrities can do wrong which, they do wrong probably every day that we don't know about and it's not advertised and things like that, you know, and ... [PAUSE]
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] It's seems like a big deal about nothing.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly. [LAUGH] Yeh, just something for people to talk about and to -- to, I dunno, just -- anything that a celebrity does they think that it's something so big and so bad when it's happened to how many other people and nobody ever says anything about it or shows -- shows anything about, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And most people don't even really care, they just -- like, it's put on the news, and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and so, you kinda get stuck watching it anyways and you're, like --
R:  Yeah.  It's something they've got to fill their time with and they think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's something they've gotta put on or whatever, so --
L:  Yeah.  Seems kinda redundant.
R:  [LAUGH] And then, they d- -- and talk about the same thing over and over for how many nights in a row?  Or something and all about -- something that's -- is absolutely nothing, so ... [PAUSE] Well, that's -- that I guess is not something I really -- is intriguing anyways.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, unless it's like something, like, I dunno -- I was interested by the O.J. trial.  Like, that was interesting hearing but --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- I think part of it was interesting to me 'cause, like, I was younger --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I was, like, just worrying about, like, the judicial system and evidence[?] and so I was able, like, tie it into school.
R:  Okay.
L:  But ... [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Other than that -- [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- [LAUGH] I think I watched the car chase and the low speed chase they had there and -- and not necessarily all -- the part they always showed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit and whatever [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I dunno, it's -- [PAUSE] [NOISE] some silly stuff anyways, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't -- I think now days people just kinda tune into it just because it's on.
R:  Yep, well, they have to because the -- the news media puts everything out there and forces you to watch it and, you know, you can't do anything, but unless you want to go to a channel that doesn't have news, so.
L:  Right.  And ...
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] It will be interesting if they just stopped doing it, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] See what people would do, they'd probably go absolutely nuts.
L:  Yeah.  But, if they -- I mean -- it just comes into their privacy too, you know, people are doing things --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- all the time and not everybody's on TV for it.  And it's just kinda -- 'cause the [inaudible] is a celebrity, they did something wrong but, like, they're people too, you know.
R:  Exactly.  And, ain't none of them perfect.  It's [LAUGH] like, they're human --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they make mistakes and -- and there's no sense in publicizing it, like, you know, if -- if I'd had done it, I would never had gotten publicized except for my little town here, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's -- but because they're somebody of [PAUSE] some importance, I guess --
L:  Because they're in a mo- -- but that's because they in the movies, there's some -- you know, like, or they're on TV, and it's kinda stupid, you know, it's like -- it's like if you or I, like, shoplifted, probably nobody would ever know.  
R:  No.
L:  You know, but, they do it and the poor woman is all over the TV and, you know, it's like -- she's obviously embarrassed by the fact.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.
R:  Definitely.  
L:  And it's like, [NOISE] I'm sure she doesn't want everyone to know.
R:  Yeah.  And if it was an accident, you know, big deal.  If it wasn't an accident, big deal, let her just do the trial, don't sit and say, "Oh, my gosh, look at what Winona Ryder did".  Who cares?  You know, it's --
L:  [NOISE] But, you know, it's even wrong -- isn't it, like, most stores normally have an in house policy, like, where they don't report you to the police but they charge you [NOISE], like, ten times the amount of the item.  Like, I had a -- this happened to a friend when she was younger, she got caught for shoplifting.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they charged her, like -- she stole, like, a fifty dollar shirt and they charged her, like, five hundred dollars.
R:  Hoo. [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Like, as a -- as a fine, basically.
R:  Mhm.  Yep.
L:  And, like, restitution and what not.  And, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they told her, either you pay this fine or you go to jail.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's like, well, [LAUGH] I'll take the fine.
R:  Oh, yeah, I'll pay the fine. [LAUGH] It's quick.
L:  You know, but, I mean, I'm sure -- I don't even know what the store it was, that she was at.  But, like, I'm sure at that store they had the option; they could have done that.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but they'd much rather get the publicity.
R:  Oh, yeah, it's free advertising for them, too, you know.  Let's see, now we have Winona Ryder steal from us, so, check it out, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, yeah, anything that start -- ah, you know, anybody that's been in the public eye, anything they do is -- I don't really care to hear about they- -- what they do, you know.  It doesn't [PAUSE] and it -- more -- it pisses me off more when they start running it and keeping it going and -- and it's something I really don't care to -- to look at in the first place.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, and I can't get away from it because everybody has got it whether it be on the radio or, you know, at the, um, the top of the hour they have everything and they talk about what happened here and there and you can't get away from it.  
L:  Right.
R:  Because it's something that the -- they all put at -- push at you, you know.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] So, it's -- I just think the news media is more to blame --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than anything because they don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they think they have to put it on there because they think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that it's something they have to -- to let people hear. [PAUSE] Are you there?  Hello?  [NOISE] I think they've been cut off, um, if anybody can get back to me and let me know what can happen here.  If I got to make another call or what.  Thanks.
