R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Who's this?
L:  [NOISE] Leelee[?]. [NOISE]
R:  Who?  Leelee?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  This is Danny.
L:  [NOISE] Hi. [NOISE]
R:  How's it going?
L:  Good.  How're you? [NOISE]
R:  Are you ready to make ten dollars?
L:  [NOISE] Sure.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about terrorists?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I guess so.  [NOISE] I think --
R:  So, what would you do in a terrorist attack?
L:  Mm -- I -- I would freak out. [LAUGH]
R:  You wouldn't freak out if, ah, somebody was bombing your house?
L:  No, I would.  I would.
R:  Oh, you would?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's good.
L:  Ah, that's good? [LAUGH]
R:  Would you save everybody?
L:  I would try to but I don't know how [NOISE] exactly you would do that if, you know, [NOISE] somebody's, like, bombarding you with -- [NOISE] [LAUGH] ah, s- -- like, but --
R:  So, you'd be the hero?
L:  [NOISE] I'd try to. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I mean, I don't know where you would go [NOISE] if somebody comes and,  [NOISE] you know, [NOISE] attacks every place.  Like, if they send a bomb, like, how are you supposed to run away from that? [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  'Cause it's supposed to be a surprise, huh?
L:  I guess so.
R:  'Cause if they, like, ah, crash a plane into your house there's not too much you can do about that, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's kinda crazy.  Like, I don't know how I'd react 'cause I can't -- I can't imagine that.  Even though we just, you know -- were in a war or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- finished the war.  But, still ...
R:  What would you do if there was a terrorist on your airplane?
L:  On my airplane? [LAUGH] Well, it -- there's nothing you can do.  I don't know.  I'd -- I'd pray. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I'd fight 'em.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Heck, yeah.
L:  What if they w- -- they w- -- like, weapons and stuff and you're not prepared for that?
R:  Well, check it out -- they're gonna crash the plane anyway so at least I, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I'm gonna at least try to save myself.  You know?
L:  Yeah.  You know, I'd try to --
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  I'd try to get everybody to, you know, um, get together and fight 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Team work, huh?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause if -- if there's only a couple of 'em, I'm sure -- I'm sure everybody has some sort of thing that they could use as a weapon in their luggage.  I mean --
R:  Like what? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't know.  They used -- what, they used plastic knives and ...
R:  Oh, yeah -- that's right.
L:  And I'm sure everybody has, like, the nail files and -- they'd have something that they'd -- you'd use as a weapon. [LAUGH]
R:  There you go. [NOISE]
L:  Even your --
R:  I'd just stand up and fight 'em.  I'd fist fight 'em.
L:  [LAUGH] What if there's, like, fifteen of 'em?
R:  If there was fifteen of 'em, I'd still take 'em all down.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah ...
R:  That's right.
L:  So, [NOISE] how long are we supposed to talk about this?
R:  Ah ... that's a good question.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ten minutes or something like that.  Yeah -- I think it's ten minutes.
L:  Oh. [NOISE] It's so weird. [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  I've never even heard about this before.
R:  How did you hear about it?
L:  [MN] Somebody -- somebody [MN] sent me an email. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Is that you heard about it?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] Ah ... [NOISE]
R:  Where do -- where do you live?
L:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] I live in -- well, I mean, I'm from San Diego but I live in, um, like, the San Francisco Bay area. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  Yeah.  I live over at -- in, ah, the Valley.  I live over in Studio City -- I don't know if you've heard of that?
L:  The Valley as in L.A.?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Do you go to school there?
R:  No.  I'm -- I'm actually a musician -- I play -- I play drums in a band but --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]. Oh, okay.  So, back to terrorism.
R:  Back to terrorism, huh?
L:  Yes. [LIPSMACK]
R:  So, ah, do you know Osama Bin Laden?
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yes I do -- we're best friends. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  No. [LAUGH] No. [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  Where do you think he is?  Where do you think he's hiding?
L:  I don't know.  I don't even know if he's, [NOISE] you know, still alive. [NOISE]
R:  I think he's in the United States somewhere.
L:  You think he's where?
R:  I think he's in the United States.
L:  Possibly, but -- m- -- but ...
R:  'Cause that's the last place we'd look for 'em.  You know?  'Cause we don't think he's here.
L:  Mm, that could be true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I mean, they have so much security now.  I don't know if -- I just --
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- he'd have a hard time getting over here, huh?
L:  Yeah.  But I don't know if they reacted too late and if he came, like, w- -- a long time before.  Who knows?
R:  My biggest [inaudible] is why isn't he dead yet, you know?
L:  Why isn't he?
R:  Yeah.  Why isn't he dead?  Why is he still alive?
L:  I know.  Well, it -- [SIGH] how do you know he's alive?
R:  How do you know he's dead?
L:  I don't.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  But he's -- he's supposedly still alive.  Well, if they -- if he was dead, I'm pretty sure they'd let everybody know.  'Cause that'd be a pretty thing to celebrate about, you know?
L:  Oh, that's true.  That's true.
R:  So, it's --
L:  Well, maybe he's still hiding out.  'Cause, you know, there's still troops there.
R:  Yeah, I know but I wish he was dead.  I mean, with all the technology we got, he needs to be dead.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  Hm.
R:  That makes me not so happy.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  It seems[?] that they spent so much money and n- -- sent so many people over there and they still haven't been able to find him.
R:  Yep. [NOISE] Horrible.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And our country's supposed to be so advanced and all there [NOISE] great technology and [NOISE] all that junk that they supposedly have ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] H- -- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
R:  Exactly.  That's --
L:  You know, it's -- it's true though.  'Cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --  the U.S. is supposed to be this big huge super power and then if they're not able to find one person, that's kinda weird. [NOISE]
R:  It's very weird. [NOISE] So, would you ever be a terrorist?
L:  Would I ever be a terrorist?  No way. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  So, if I -- if I was gonna give you a billion dollars, you wouldn't fly a plane into a building? [NOISE]
L:  No, 'cause I would die with it.
R:  Ah.
L:  And there's --
R:  Well --
L:  -- no point having a billion dollars if you're dead. [NOISE]
R:  What if -- what if I gave you a billions dollars to fly a plane into a building and you could parachute out at the last second and live?
L:  [LAUGH] Ah ...
R:  And you'd only -- you'd only kill ten people.
L:  I know.  But it's sad to think that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- y- -- how would you live for the rest of your life knowing that you killed [NOISE] somebody?
R:  I -- I was just making sure.  I was just making sure you weren't crazy or something.
L:  Oh, thanks. [LAUGH] Well, I'm glad to see that I passed your test.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, but [NOISE] -- you know, you can't -- you -- even a billion dollars is not enough money to know that you killed somebody.
R:  Yep.  Oh, I agree.
L:  [LAUGH] Good. [LAUGH]
R:  So, do you know any terrorists?
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.
L:  Yeah.  I guess -- I guess it is. [LAUGH] Do you?
R:  I only know a few but ...
L:  You only know a few?
R:  Yeah.  But, you know, that's -- it's no big deal.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  They're nice guys.
L:  [LAUGH] I -- they're in your band? [LAUGH]
R:  How'd you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Oh ...
R:  But don't tell anybody all right?
L:  [LAUGH] I promise I won't.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what kind of music do you play?
R:  Ah, good old rock and roll.
L:  Nice.  What's your band called?
R:  Well, we're -- we're trying to figure out our name.  We're -- we're, ah, stuck between Nine Dollar Couch and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, the other name that -- that we're --
L:  That --
R:  -- deciding on is -- is Myth.  So --
L:  Is what?
R:  -- it's between -- Myth.  Myth.
L:  It --
R:  Like --
L:  Oh.
R:  Myth.  Like a --
L:  Oh.  I see.
R:  -- fable.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [MN] So --
L:  Oh.  Not Another Couch and Myth?
R:  No -- Nine Dollar Couch.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  Nine Dollar Couch.
L:  Nine Dollar Couch.  Well ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.  'Cause there's a couch in our living room and it cost nine dollars.  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  We've -- we've figured that would be kind of cool.
L:  Nine Dollar Couch sounds more like a rock band than Myth.  That sounds like --
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's what I'm saying.
L:  -- Myth sounds like Kiss.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, it sounds o- old and cheesy and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But hey -- you never know.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  Maybe -- maybe we could be the -- The Terrorists.  That -- that could be our band name.
L:  Oh, don't even talk about that -- that's so scary. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Considering that there's terrorists in my band, I think it'd be quite appropriate. [NOISE].
L:  Uh-uh. [LAUGH] Oh, I th- -- [LAUGH] oh, [LAUGH] your band could be called Terrorists? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  What'd you think I said?
L:  I thought you said you could be a terrorist. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're gonna get me in trouble here.
L:  Ah ... [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] but ...
R:  I'm no terrorist.
L:  Mm. [NOISE] I don't know. [NOISE] I wonder if there're any terrorists here? [NOISE] I'm sure there are. [NOISE]
R:  I'm sure there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm sure there's a terrorist in your house right now -- you should be careful.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my gosh.  No -- I'm the only one here.
R:  Mm.
L:  You're like, "Exactly".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I know -- have you ever seen Arlington Road?
R:  The movie?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.  I've not seen it.  Probably --
L:  It's all about terrorist.  Kinda scary.
R:  Is it any good?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's really good.
R:  And it's all about terrorism?
L:  Kind of, yeah.  Mm -- yeah it is about terrorism. [NOISE]
R:  Is, ah -- is Osama Bin Laden in it? [NOISE]
L:  No.  But --
R:  No?
L:  -- Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins are.
R:  Well, they're just as good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Same thing.
L:  No.  But it's really scary 'cause, like, the person, like -- Tim Robbins is a neighbour and he's the terrorist and, like, he -- you totally don't expect that he's, you know, a terrorist 'cause he's someone living in your [NOISE] n- neighborhood that your kids play with their kids [NOISE] and it's kinda scary. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  That's kinda weird to think about that --
L:  M- -- yeah.
R:  -- there could be a --
