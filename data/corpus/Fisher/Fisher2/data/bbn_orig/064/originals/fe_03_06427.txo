L:  Hi, I'm Sally.
R:  Hi, I'm Mary.
L:  Hi, Mary.
R:  How are you tonight?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Wonderful thank you.
L:  Good.  Have you done this survey today yet?
R:  No, I have not.
L:  Oh.  And neither have I.  Um, so, did you want to go ahead and start? 
R:  Okay, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- this is the first time I've done the survey, period.
L:  Oh, wow!  
R:  Well -- 
L:  Well, welcome aboard.
R:  [LAUGH] Thank you.  It seems qu- -- ah, quite interesting, um, you know, for them to just I guess record your words and ...
L:  Yeah, um, you know, the fir- -- I was kinda nervous the first, ah, time I did it, 'cause I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- really wasn't sure what to expect.  But everybody that I have had phone calls with are very cordial and -- and, you know, you just have to express what your opinion is and, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] really --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- don't matter what everybody elses opinion is --
R:  You guess --  
L:  -- you just express your own.
R:  Absolutely.  And --
L:  So --
R:  -- so tonight's topic is --
L:  Panic.
R:  -- how people would react during --
L:  Um, to --
R:  -- a terrorist attack, right?
L:  Correct.
R:  Whether people would be calm or --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people would be, ah, in a frenzy I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I believe it said how I would react.  I would hope that I would react very calmly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And just -- 
L:  I -- I would hope that I would react very calmly too.  But I, um, don't know how I would handle the pressure.  [PAUSE] Or I might wait until everything was over with and then panic.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then -- exactly, and then --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- fall apart and then just totally fall apart but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess in a, [MN] you know, you would hope in a serious life threatening situation like that ...
L:  That you could keep your head on straight?
R:  Yeah, you know, you're --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you would put your emotions aside and you would just do what --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you had to do and, you know, other people --
L:  Yeah, then it --
R:  -- would be --
L:  -- then it becomes survival. Yeah.  And that you don't -- that you don't just quit functioning.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, I didn't really read a lot of interviews of people who survived nine eleven to wonder, you know, what they went through or how they would deal with -- how they dealt with it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, I don't know if you had any exposure to that at all.
L:  Not really.  Um, I'm a -- I'm in Oregon and I know, you know, very -- [inaudible] a few people maybe that were there around that area and that w- -- o- -- um, [PAUSE] [MN] went through that but, um, not closely enough that it's -- it, ah, affected [MN] you know, me.
R:  Okay.  Right.  Okay -- that you saw the -- yeah.  I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I was a little bit closer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, just -- I had read one person's experience where his coworker was in the building.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, he wrote about, you know, what happened so, you know, it's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just a horrible, horrible thing.  But even then today in the newspaper I saw where so- -- in my local town here they were doing a, um, rehearsal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for a terrorist --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- attack and they had people in the drama school --
L:  I think they've been doing that all over.
R:  Okay.  That's a wonderful thing.
L:  Yeah.  They did -- they have it -- you know, Seattle's not very far from me and, uh, they had a great big, uh, thing, a -- a reenactment.  So, is that what they were doing there?
R:  Yes.  They -- well, actually this was a carjacking they did.
L:  Oh.
R:  But it was the same kind of a, you know, a terrorist --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- situation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they had high school students who were being hijacked on a bus.  'Cause that happened on the East coast not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- too long ago.  So, you know --
L:  Do you know about the six terrorists that they re keeping in Portland?  Um --
R:  No.
L:  -- that were, um, a lady and her ex husband and, um, oh, I guess they're, ah ... [MN] they're affiliated with the, uh, terrorists, uh, that did the nine eleven thing and [PAUSE] h- -- were -- were you aware of the -- this --
R:  No.  No, not at all.
L:  Oh, really!  Well, they have six people that they have in cu- -- federal custody in Portland.  And it was very strange that, uh, my mother's friend is, ah, a ha- -- girlfriend is a nurse at a place where these people all work and she said that these are the loveliest people.  They're very nice, very generous, warm people.  And it amazes me how they can get along with everybody in the United States, and fit in and work and do all of this, and turn around and, ah, kill millions of people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- including their own families.  How they have no --
R:  No conscience.
L:  -- you know, mhm.
R:  No, you know ...   Wow, that's horrible 
L:  Or, you know, I just can't -- I can't fathom the idea of them thinking that this is for a greater good of any kind.  I'm --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, I don't understand that.
R:  Yes.  And then to feel that they can just blend in with society and like you said, be friends with people and then turn around and do something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I guess that's the next level on this conversation would be i- -- what if it was someone you knew --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whom, you know, when they're saying well, how would you react in a terrorist situation?  What if that was your neighbor whom you thought was a good person and then you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- found out that, you know, they weren't.
L:  Yeah, it makes you wonder what's, you know, how well do we really know people.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, yeah, my husband was taking, uh, flight instructions from the same place that one of the terrorists I guess was also taking some flight classes and stuff.  But we never seen him or never knew him.
R:  Wow!
L:  But yeah, that's interesting.  Yeah.  How close we are to these kind of or, y- you know, people that we have no idea what they do wi- --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with their regular life.
R:  Right.  Now is your husband a pilot?
L:  Um, he well, yeah, kinda, sorta.  I guess he pl- -- flies, um, non commercial type things and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh, hel- helicopters and -- and stuff like that.  We jo- joy ride more than anything else.
R:  Okay.  Well, that'd be fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But here again, he could be -- what if he was a -- a pilot on a commercial flight?  That would be a good question --
L:  That would be scary --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- for me, yeah.  And, you know, my husband is from Hawaii [PAUSE] and he is native Hawaiian, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, [MN] when all of the nine eleven stuff happened, I was kind of skeptical about how people would like at us because we're interracial and we've had, you know, um, a lot of people look at us, like, we were interracial, you know, in the beginning.  But, you know, I don't see his skin color as any different than my own.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I [inaudible] --
L:  But after nine eleven, um, you know, your -- everybody was looking at anybody with darker skin going, "What kind of nationality is he?"
R:  Oh, that's terrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, 'cause Hawaii is a part of the country, you know, it is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- part of the United States.
L:  Right.  But, you know, we live among some -- a lot of, uh, Spanish people and I don't know exactly where you're at in Pennsylvania, or what kind of ethnicity you have there, but, um, we have a melting pot of different, um, cultures here.  And I think that everybody kind of looked, you know, abo- -- what color was their skin and -- and are you my enemy or not?
R:  Okay.  And that's a shame because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's just -- that's just a shame.
L:  Yes it is.  It's very sad.
R:  Well ...
L:  Do you -- do you live with a lot of different cultures there?
R:  I would say yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not too far outside of Philadelphia.
L:  Oh!  Oh, okay.  Well --
R:  Philadelphia would be my biggest metropolis close --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- close to me.  [PAUSE] And that's like any big city there's many --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- you know, cultures --
L:  Yes. Y- you -- there's a lot of diversity there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And here again, like, when they're talking with terrorists, I know they did a lot of things with the liberty bell and, you know, there were so many monuments --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in stark Philadelphia that they felt that they wanted to protect --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if anything happened.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And every now and then you hear -- if there is a heightened alert, you know, they always guard the liberty bell and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the whole Bethuross[?] area and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  Are we in heightened al- -- ah, alert at the -- I thought that we were last night. I felt --
R:  I believe we are again, yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I do believe I heard that again.  And my mother's flying this weekend so, [LAUGH] I wasn't --
L:  You know, it's funny you said that.  Right after the war started, my mother was going back to +Missouri; she's from Saint Louis.  And, um, she was afraid to fly 'cause, you know, she j- -- we just didn't know to expect.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, that is scary when we're in state of alert to, you know, [PAUSE] be in the air.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I guess it could be anywhere, you know, you just never know so ...
L:  Right.  But, you know, our wars of yesteryear are so very different than they are today, you know --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- yeah.  And it used to be, you know, there was fighting in a particular county and we didn't see it, you know, many miles away.  But now we see it all over from, y- you know, the front of our newspapers, email, um, things that can happen at any time.  How far the missiles can go, all kinds of things.
R:  Yes.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  And this is the first time it's been in our own back yard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I feel bad for the children.  Because how do you explain it to small children and, you know, grade school kids?  And, you know, 'specially on that horrible day, do you send them home? 
L:  Mhm
R:  Do you keep them there?  What do y- -- you know, what do the parents, [MN] you know --
L:  And then --
R:  -- what are their wishes?
L:  Yeah.  And the other aspect of it; all of these children that live with this every day in their lives.
R:  Yes.  That would --
L:  I --
R:  -- be a horrible thing.  I could not imagine, you know -- we have to kiss the ground of America because if you were in other countries where bombs are an everyday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- part of your life, uh, that would just -- that would just be a horrible, horrible thing.
L:  Yeah.  I think that we don't even have th- the first clue as to what --
