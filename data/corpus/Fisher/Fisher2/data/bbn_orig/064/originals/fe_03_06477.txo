L:  Hi.  I'm [inaudible] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Hi, my name is -- hello?
L:  [LAUGH] Go ahead.
R:  My name is Diane.
L:  I'm Marnie.
R:  Hi, Marnie, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Okay.  
L:  Good.
R:  Uh, this is, uh, trials?  Televised trials, correct?
L:  Yes.  Yes --
R:  Yeah.  What --
L:  -- that's what I understand.  I -- it's not the, um ... [LIPSMACK] the ones they do every day.  I can't see where they're from.
R:  No, it's like the ones like O.J. and stuff like that.
L:  Right, that's what I though too.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  That's what I think.  
L:  So --
R:  What do you think about it?
L:  Actually, I don't see any harm in them being on TV.  Um, as long as the ... um, jury members don't see what's going on.  As -- you know, as far as the print and everything else that goes on outside.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um ... I don't see any harm in it.
R:  I think myself that sometimes, like, the one with O.J. --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was just like too much publicity on it.
L:  Yeah, very good point.
R:  And I think it might have swayed some people on how they thought about it.  Like, how can I say it?  I saw a l- -- I- I'm using O.J. as an example --
L:  That's a very good one.
R:  -- [COUGH] and, uh, how can I say?  I saw where they picked him up, you know, with the race?  With the, um, Blazer, you know?  
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  And how can they say it was like -- everybody was waiting for the results of the trial.  You know, and --
L:  This is -- so --
R:  -- was he guilty or innocent?  And at times I think they kind of made a mockery of our system on that one.  
L:  Um --
R:  That one I think was really overdone.  
L:  It was over done and -- and I agree.  You are right.
R:  [MN] But --
L:  Um, I -- I think that maybe it's better to have, like, Dateline or someone come in after the fact and then show all the information.
R:  Yeah, I think they should have a -- you know, uh, filmed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think what they should do is screen it and just show highlights of it as a low key thing.
L:  You've changed my mind. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] Oh, [LAUGH] well, I'm surprised.
L:  You have.  No, I mean, thinking about logically that way it -- it makes very good sense.  It isn't something that, um ... we all have to -- it -- it isn't really the drama that needs to be played out in front of our eyes anyway.
R:  Right and the same thing with the Kennedy cousin.
L:  Right.
R:  Remember him?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, he won and he defied the courts and everything.  
L:  Right.
R:  I didn't get to watch the whole one with him.  I just got, you know, excerpts of it, you know?  
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And it was like he was deny- -- you know he -- he -- if he's guilty or not, that's not my decision --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but he wa- -- and he would be late for court and, I mean, from what I gather it was like, you know, he thought he was above the trial.
L:  Right.
R:  And he did get found guilty though and he is in jail.  
L:  Mm, that's true.
R:  He was sentenced to jail --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and they han- -- you know, with a picture of his aunt come in and all that, you know, and the, uh ...
L:  That's very impressive.
R:  It's very impressive to people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think sometimes we just see too much.
L:  We do see too much and I agree with that.
R:  Mm, [MN] especially like with O.J.  That's the one -- I think that was the biggest one there ever was --
L:  Yes, I'm sure it was.
R:  -- and everybody was watching it and I think ... what's his name?  Johnny Cochran? 
L:  Yes.
R:  I think it just made a big name for him to be -- he became a big star.
L:  He did.
R:  And even the judge, if I remember correctly, was writing a book or something.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yes, they all [inaudible].
R:  And it was like a -- a money thing.
L:  It was, big time.  It was a money thing.
R:  [MN] And it was like a -- to me it was like who -- who could make the more money, you know what I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was on publicity and all this stuff and it was just a money thing and to me that's not how our judicial system should be run.
L:  No, it shouldn't and it is a mockery, just like you said.
R:  And, uh, I think they should be -- I think they should show it and they should be able to record some of the stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but not like on a -- like a s- -- it was like a soap opera.
L:  It was.  You're right.
R:  And I don't know how many months it ran.
L:  Oh, my.  It was forever.
R:  O.J. was almost a year, wasn't it?
L:  Yeah, it was close.  It was.
R:  And I mean, like, almost every day that was it, you know?  It was, like, just like a soap opera.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't know if he -- if he was innocent or guilty.  That's not -- I wasn't on th- -- 
L:  Right.
R:  I wasn't a juror, you know?  
L:  No, I wasn't either.
R:  But the fact -- but you just gotta remember those jurors, who knows what they might of made?
L:  Oh, afterwards?  Absolutely.
R:  You know?  
L:  Definitely.
R:  I mean, you become a famous person.  Hey, you were on the O.J. Simpson trial.  
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Even if you were the bailiff or something there.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I kind of think it's a good idea but I think they don't -- they use it for certain things too much.  Now, they had those court programs.
L:  Yes.
R:  I never really got to watch them.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't watch them.
R:  Because I work all day.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I don't get to see 'em but I know they do have some court programs because  a friend of mine tells me about it and some of them are very interesting, but they're not real publicized. 
L:  No.  Uh-uh.  Not like the other.
R:  I think it is.  I think it would be good as a learning tool though for kids.
L:  Mm, that's an interesting thought.  Sure.
R:  [MN] It just came to my mind.  You know, to let 'em know what the judicial system's like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, if it's something that, uh ... because I -- I -- I -- from what I gather, they're based -- they're true stories --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- right in the courtroom.
L:  From what I understand they are.
R:  You know, it's not like when we were kids.  When I was a kid they had a day in court, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was- -- I don't know if it was real or not, you know?  But -- or a divorce court or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] But these are real live stories --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- from real courtrooms.
L:  Right.
R:  But those ones, I don't know too much about so I can't comment on it.  
L:  No.
R:  The only ones I know about is the, uh, Kennedy cousin --
L:  The big time, yeah.
R:  -- and O.J. --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know and I think O.J. was the one that -- like I says, really caused the --
L:  Oh o- overdone.
R:  Overdone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and at times I think it was a mo- mockery to the, um, our system.  If it's done in good taste, I think it's a good idea.  As long as it doesn't become a fiasco and I don't know --
L:  And I don't think that can happen.
R:  [MN] I kinda think it did with O.J.
L:  No, no, no.  I mean, I don't think it -- the other way around.  I don't think they can do it without it becoming a fiasco.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's kinda hard, you know, nowadays.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't know.  Is there any big -- uh, I haven't heard of anything big on TV right now.
L:  I don't know of any.  [inaudible].
R:  [MN] But then too, I don't get a chance to watch 'em, you know?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like I say, they do have some, I don't know, Judge someone of [inaudible].
L:  Judge Judy and Judge ... I'm not sure who all they are.  I don't watch them.
R:  Oh, neither do I.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Are they real live ones?
L:  Um, I'm not sure if they're live or if they're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- taped but they're actual car- court case --
R:  They're actual cases that they show?  
L:  Yeah.  Yes.
R:  Are they like -- they're not big cases, though, are they?
L:  No.  No, no.
R:  No, no.  They're like, um ... oh, how can you say it?  Um ...
L:  They're just, um ... yeah.
R:  Small claims court?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right where --
R:  I think that would be good for, uh, kids to see, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like as a learning tool to let 'em know what happens in small claims court if you're studying something like political science.
L:  Right.
R:  I think in high school it'd be a great learning tool.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] You know, when you're studying about the court system and that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, to watch something like that for, you know, a couple of -- a week maybe.  
L:  Right.
R:  And see how the system really works, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's what I -- I think -- if they're +choosed in the proper perspective, as long as it doesn't get carried out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of control. 
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh --
L:  Getting back to the other one, um ... [LIPSMACK] I think you -- they are overplayed and I think that you're right about ... people looking forward to every day.  This is -- it becomes their life.
R:  Yeah!
L:  Every little thing that happens --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- affects them on a -- on a personal level, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it really became ... that real to all the people involved --
R:  Oh yeah.  
L:  -- watching it.
R:  But they have the trial of O.J. when they were giving the verdict.  All of us, we had a television at work.  We all walk -- walked into the conference room where the television was to find out the verdict.
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  At that time, yeah.
L:  Well, it was, uh, [inaudible] thing.
R:  We were sitting there waiting to see ...
L:  -- that --
R:  What happened?
L:  It was that big of a deal.
R:  It was that big of a deal.
L:  And --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- it's amazing how one person's life can take over your life then.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  When you think about it.
R:  I mean, e- e- every day everybody would be talking about the trial.  You know, what --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- happened yesterday?  What happened, you know?  Well, this is it.  This is it.  This one thought this one -- well, what about the glove?  I think there was something about the glove than -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- than in his hand or something.  Or with getting dirt on it.  I mean ... and everybody have their own opinions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Of course, it was one -- it was a diversion from all the problems but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know --
L:  True.
R:  -- and it was like the -- I'm in Chicago.  It was like the Bulls, you know, when the Bulls --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- were on top.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Everybody would come in and wanna talk about the game.  "Are you gonna watch the game?  Are you gonna watch the game?" you know?  
L:  Right.
R:  And it gives you something to think about besides the day to day problems but ...
L:  That's good but it needs to be something other than ... somebody else's life in that --
R:  No- --
L:  -- respect I think.
R:  Not only that but ... there was -- he -- I know he was in a civil court he was found guilty.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.  But, uh he --
L:  So, it makes you wonder.
R:  Mhm.  [MN] And --
L:  There were a lot of politics with that.  A lot of money involved in that.  Um --
R:  The civil one?
L:  No, the other one.
R:  I have no idea.  I'm sure Johnny Cochran -- I don't know if he made a lot of money but I know one thing right now, he makes big bucks.
L:  Yep.
R:  I mean, he -- they had this -- I'm in Chicago and they had this E two ... I don't know if you remember right around -- in the winter or sometime w- um ... [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] It was a nightclub and, uh, there was a fire there started --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, remember? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he came running to Chicago to, uh --
L:  Uh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- become the attorney for a lot of the families.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.  Johnny Cochran, you know?  And the minute you hear his name you know -- everybody knows Johnny Cochran.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, I can't remember who the woman was that, uh, pr- -- uh, the --
L:  I don't remember her name either.
R:  Yeah --
