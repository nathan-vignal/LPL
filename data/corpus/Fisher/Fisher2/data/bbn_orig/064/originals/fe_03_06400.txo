L:  Hi, my name's Erica.
R:  Hi Erica, this is Dale.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  So, did you hear what the topic is?
L:  Yes, it's about terrorism, right?
R:  Yeah.  Um ...
L:  So, what are your feelings on that?  [LAUGH]
R:  I have [LAUGH] -- I personally can't imagine anyone staying calm. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Nor can I.  Yeah.
R:  Um, you would -- even i- though if you're panicked I would assume you would try and keep your head clear enough to -- to act --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to protect yourself but, um --
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  If there was an explosion or something I don't -- it -- it's a shock so I don't know that anybody can really think about it and control themselves.
R:  Right.  Even with all the, um ... [SIGH] the -- the publicity and media coverage, you know, that's, been --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that topic in the last twenty months, it's still, um, is something that you wouldn't be ... prepared for and be able to take in stride I don't think.
L:  Right.  No I agree, definitely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah I don't -- I think I would, uh -- I -- I guess it depends on what kind of act it was of course.  But if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was a huge explosion, I think I would ... run or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- that's true.
L:  And then kind of ca- -- you know, uh, get myself together and then try to help out.
R:  Yeah, I think my reaction would be the same, um, as that too.  I have -- have you done anything to try and be prepared for something like that?
L:  Um, no, I don't get too excited because I never -- I mean -- I don't know, you know, there's that whole duct tape and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, stealing -- I mean, I'm not going to do that if -- if there's really some kind of nuclear bomb, I don't think duct tape and Saran wrap is really going to help me out. 
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  I've tried --  
L:  So, I don't -- I try not to buy into the hype too much, but just to be aware also of, you know, suspicious things, or I don- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I was dating somebody from Israel and I visit there in every summer, so I'm, um, I'm used to that kind of feeling --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that, um, I mean I feel much more secure actually over there, just because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's so many soldiers around.  And there's always people on the lookout for stuff like that --
R:  Oh, good point.
L:  -- but -- yeah.  So, I mean I know when -- after nine elven [NOISE] all, you know, they put national guardsmen in the airports and in certain places and everybody wh- you know, a lot of people were uncomfortable about it but I don't understand why that would make people uncomfortable.  It makes me feel more safe --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that they're there.
R:  D- I had the same thing and -- and whenever I was in an airport and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and asked to have my bags, you know, when they want to -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they searched my bags and all, I've -- was always, "By all means, go right ahead".
L:  Yeah, sure, please.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And do everybody else too, yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Exactly.  No, I don't understand the people who complain about the lines, or that people are checking.  I mean, what is -- if they're looking out for our safety, how can you complain about that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, people I think have their priorities, uh, mixed up a little.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's a kind --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- of narrow focused if they're just worried about themselves.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, um, I -- I know, like in Israel they, you know they check your bags anywhere you go.  Like if you walk into a mall, there's a soldier there and he just takes a quick, you know, you just open up your purse and he takes a quick glance at it.  So, ah, that's something that you have to get used to in going over there.  And so here, you know that -- that would be -- I know that would be hard for people because people --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- are so, you know, big on their freedom and their privacy and stuff, but I don't know I think -- I don't think that's too big of a deal to, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, to keep you safe.
R:  Yeah, I agree with that too.
L:  [MN] It's not -- no big deal, you just let 'em look.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  On the other hand, I really can't imagine, uh, what it would be like to be in a mall or some public place and suddenly have a suicide bomber --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, um --
L:  Ah, I -- I -- 
R:  -- act.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know -- wow, I don't even know what I would do.  I mean, I guess it depends if you're hurt obviously.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  But if you're -- if you're not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- then, you know --
R:  Assuming it was just near me, then, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I guess I would just run [LAUGH] the other way.
L:  Yeah.  And then I think you would hide and then realize what's happened and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I think you would try to help I guess.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- hopefully I'll never have to be in that position, but if I [LAUGH] do, I would hope it's what I would do.
R:  [SIGH] And we heard, um, you know, during the -- the September eleventh attacks we heard some stories about people --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- who really were courageous.  And when they were --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were faced with the, you know, when they were in that situation and all the stories about people who helped other people and then the -- of course th- the real big one was the, uh, people on that airplane that --
L:  Right.  Right, it was just to try --
R:  -- that were --
L:  -- to take over. 
R:  -- able to keep their heads calm enough to, um ... to try and sabotage their e- efforts, so ...
L:  Right.  Yeah I think everybody, I don't know -- in -- deep down inside something, you know, either you're kinda -- you have the hero mentality or -- you have that inside of you or you don't and, I don't know, I think ... [MN] I think that it's just instinct and that just kicks in, in people.
R:  Yeah -- yeah that's true. 
L:  I think, you know, it's like doctors or nurses, they have an instinct too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or most I should say have [LAUGH] an instinct to, you know, just help and if there's a problem, you fix it.  And then some people are, you know, I guess I would -- I don't know if I'd say more cowardly ... but I d- I don't know what I'd call it but they just don't, you know ...
R:  Well, I wonder if part of that comes from having a certain amount of confidence in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- themselves that, um, even if they haven't intellectually thought it through and thought what they can do, their --
L:  Right.
R:  -- immediate reaction is to know that they do have something to offer and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so they're comfortable with jumping in and --
L:  Right, or it's just may- yeah --
R:  -- getting involved.
L:  -- maybe a -- a lack of fear I guess ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of, uh, you know -- or j- or just understanding the situation also.  I think those guys in the plane, ah, at some point understood after talking to people outside that it -- [MN] they were either going to do down fighting or not, so I think, you know, they had a choice to make and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they chose --
R:  Yeah, that was awesome.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Really. [LAUGH] 
L:  Awesome and awful, yeah definitely.
R:  Yes, that's right, um, very definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Uh --
L:  But yeah, I would hope that I would, uh -- I think -- I don't now, I think I've put in my mind that I would do something and whenever I get on a plane, like I'm ready to fight [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I'm always looking around and I'm just like, "All right, who's -- who's it going to be?"
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  But I think if you prepare -- or even if you're walking outside by yourself or something, if you're just ready and -- and it doesn't come as a shock.  So, I think that's what hinders people is -- is the shock of it all.  You know when people get attacked, you know, on the street or mugged, they're defenseless, not because they don't know what to do, or they haven't taken classes, it's because they're not ready and they're not -- you know, it's shocking and you're kind of paralyzed for a minute.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I think if you're a -- kind of psyched up and ready -- kinda ready to fight, then it's not a shock and you kind of, uh, know what to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, know how to react quicker.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  I think that's right too.  So, I guess, um, I'm trying to remember now, was our topic whether we thought most people would ... would -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- panic?  Or ...
L:  Yeah.  And then also, how we would react.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know, most people -- I'm trying to think.  I mean we can just look at history and see what most people have done, you know, we've had the Oklahoma bombing and stuff and I think -- I think most people, you know, it's shocking and you run --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then you for a moment think about, okay what just happened?  And is it safe, you know, y- you also have to think about yourself; is it safe to return to the area to help out?
R:  Right, yeah.  Um, because we -- we do know that total panic doesn't accomplish anything --
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  -- and you do have to kind of assess things and -- and see, uh, what you have to offer the situation and what --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can do.
L:  I mean, even in, you know, occasions of fires or anything that's kind of, ah, shocking and sudden.  I don't know, I'm -- I'm trying to think.  I -- I think actually a lot of people would panic and that might cause a problem.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Unfortunately [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  I mean, I guess, you know, it's -- it's, uh, your survival instinct kinda kicks in and it's like get out or run or whatever it is.  So that kinda, ah, that doesn't help when you're, you know, in the situation because you just want to run like now.  And if somebody's in front of you or something, you might have a tendency to trample them or, you know, just do what's right for yourself. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what we have at stake also would play a part in how likely we would be to get involved and try and help  --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the situation.  If it's in a -- a public place where, you know, maybe a parent has their children with them, then their first concern's going to be --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- to get their -- to save --
L:  Their children.
R:  -- their children, so ...
L:  Right, definitely.  Yeah, it's, you know, so it's survival instinct --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and who -- who's, ah, you know, the por- importance list I guess of who's ... who you're going to save first, or who's -- who's more imp- most important to you.
R:  Right.
L:  I guess, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's an interesting topic [LAUGH].
L:  I know, right [LAUGH].  Well, I guess it's appropriate for this time.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Do you -- do you ever get worried about when they raise that color thing to, like, it's orange right now?
R:  Well, I have -- I'm aware --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- of it -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, I guess, um, that I really have not done anything different.  I think -- when did they raise it?  Yesterday or -- 
L:  I think so.
R:  -- the day before?
L:  Yeah, the day before I think actually.
R:  I don't think I have done anything differently.  I haven't paid closer attention to things -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that were going on.  And that's terrible, uh --
