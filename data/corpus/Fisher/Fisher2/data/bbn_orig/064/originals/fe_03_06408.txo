L:  Hi, my name is Maria.
R:  Hi Maria, um, my name is Sarah.
L:  Hi.  Um, so, our +topic topic are like terrorist attacks.
R:  Yeah, hold on just a second, I'm going to turn your volume down a little bit, okay?
L:  Uh?
R:  Sounded to me like the topic was how do you think people would react after a terrorist attack?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah, what do you think?
R:  I think it depends on -- it depends on whether they have something to do.  I know that, um, when I'm -- when there's a panic situation around me, if I have, you know, things that need to be done like for a terrorist attack, maybe it would be collecting stuff or evacuating or calling people, then I'm pretty calm.  But if you don't have anything to do that's when I think people panic.
L:  You really think so?  I don't think it would make a difference to me.
R:  What would you do?
L:  Um, I really don't know.  I think I would probably -- if it, like, was in my city or something, or in my state, I'd probably panic.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I don't think I would remain calm, no.
R:  Ah, how old are you?
L:  I'm twenty two.
R:  So, you don't have -- do you have, like, ah, family members to take care of?  Or children --
L:  No.
R:  -- or pets or anything like that?
L:  No.
R:  That's -- I -- 
L:  It's just me.
R:  -- that's what I find, is if I've got my pets to take care of and my husband to take care of, I don't have time to panic.
L:  Oh, yeah maybe.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  'Cause I remember when that thing in New York happened --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I was in Chicago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was kind of scared.  I was kind of scared to leave the house and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to drink the water.  And I shouldn't have but I was so ...
R:  But you were in a big city then?
L:  In Chicago, yeah.
R:  Wow!  Yeah, you know, I lived in a small town, uh, so I wasn't concerned about being, um, hit.  But then in a few days I went to Boston, and I found that I was, um, really uncomfortable driving past tall buildings.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And it was th- th- -- yeah, that was the first thing.  And the other thing that was weird was, um, the first time, you know, there were no -- no airplanes of course flying for quite a while, and the first time I heard a plane fly over, after they started flying again, that made me kinda scared.
L:  Ooh!
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah --
R:  So, what di- --
L:  -- I don't -- I -- I don't know how most people -- I think, um, I don't know when -- [inaudible] there was, like, once I went to a concert --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, somebody started shooting but I don't think they had a real gun.  But everybody really panicked and started running --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- and they were running over each other, like, nobody would, you know, pay attention to other people and everybody was just keep running and bumping into other people.  So, I think people were panicking.
R:  Sure.
L:  And people --
R:  Did people get trampled?
L:  Yeah.  I think so.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  I mean, after, like, you know, two minutes everybody found out that there was, like, no, um, you know, real problem.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, everything calmed down again.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] But yeah, they were acting, like, really, wow!  I was really surprised and shocked.
R:  Was it, um -- was it the kind of concert where maybe a lot of people would have been drinking?  Or not -- or not that kinda --
L:  No.  Because it was in the daytime.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  No.  I don't think so.  It was more like an outside event from a radio station.
R:  I see.
L:  So, no, I don't think a lot of people were drunk.
R:  I imagine that would make a difference how people would react.  But, you know, that when they had the fire in that building, you know, in Connecticut several months ago?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And o- -- they had a big panic and a lot of people got trampled and I thought I wonder how they would have acted if they hadn't mostly probably all had a few drinks.  Would they have been able to think better?  And find their way out better instead of just -- 
L:  Probably.
R:  -- like, running over each other?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, like, I also remember when I was in a car accident, uh, I tended to -- to panic also.  I am not the type of person who will get out of the car and be calm about it.
R:  Really?
L:  So ...
R:  I -- I panic eventually but I don't panic till later.  Like, I get --
L:  Really?
R:  -- things do- -- yeah.  I get things done that have to be done and then after it's over, that's when I fall apart.
L:  Oh, 'cause th- -- yeah, that's when you have time then to really let go kinda like.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, oh, I see -- I see.  
R:  My -- 
L:  No, I'm not like that.
R:  My husband, however, runs around in little circles [LAUGH] so, he needs somebody like me to take care of him in an emergency because he totally falls apart.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ooh, yeah, yeah.  It's good that it -- you don't panic.  I mean, that's really good.
R:  Yeah, I -- and I've done a lot of things where it was helpful.  Like, I've been a lifeguard.  You can't panic if you're a lifeguard --
L:  No.  You can't.
R:  -- you have to save somebody.  And, um, some other things like that where I work in disasters and that kind of thing and so, I -- you know, I wouldn't be able to do any of that kind of stuff if I was a panicker.  So --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think though that the majority of people, ah, would stay calm?  Or probably, like ...
R:  Well, I don't know about stay calm.  But, um, I would think that -- well, I, you know, all I can think of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm not a mother but I would just think, like, from the perspective of people who have children, I would think the first thing that they would probably do is wanna take care of them.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so- some of them might freak out, I don't know, but, um, I -- it was interesting -- I think it was interesting of course --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seeing how people reacted in New York who weren't, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- obviously who weren't killed or anything and just how they were handling themselves.  And they weren't screaming a lot.
L:  No.  No.  No.  Actually, no.  That's true.  I've never seen -- there was so much, like, going on about nine eleven, but I actually never saw any filming, like, when it happened, how people, you know, were running in the streets.  I never saw it.  I wished I would have seen it but I never saw anything like that.
R:  There was an interesting show on.  There was some filmmakers from France; did you see that?  They were inside --
L:  No.
R:  -- they were inside one of the buildings when it happened.  Um, what happened was they were actually making a film about a fire department in New York.  And when the first building was hit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before any building fell, they went with the fire department into this building.
L:  Ooh!
R:  And -- and so they were in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the second building that fell -- they were in it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when the first building fell.  And so their building was of course all filled up with dust because, uh, they're connected by a tunnel.  And then they had to get out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, so it was really -- 'cause I saw things that they were very careful to shield us from, like, you know, a lot of people had jumped out of the building and then that -- b- it fell. 
L:  I never seen that either.  I heard that people were jumping out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of the buildings.  I never saw anybody.
R:  Um, th- -- I saw some -- and they were pretty -- I think American television was pretty careful not to show that because, you know, how many people might know somebody who --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- worked in that building or something. But in that video you could see -- they -- they showed other things.  They didn't dwell on it or anything.  They were pretty tasteful.  But, um, I was thinking just the other day about would I jump if I knew there was no way out?  And I wonder what happens in somebody's mind to make them decide to jump.  'Cause they can't possibly think they're going to live.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, maybe it's just to keep from burning to death or something.  I don't know.  Ooh.
L:  Hm.
R:  So do you still live in Chicago?
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No, I live in LA now.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah. So, I don't know.  I was never really worried about anything happening here 'cause I always felt they were gonna r- r- either attack New York again --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or maybe -- I was even more afraid in Chicago than here.  I don't think anybody's going to attack LA so ... no.
R:  LA's so stretched out, it might even be hard for them to pick one particular --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thing to attack.
L:  That's the way I felt so too because it's so, yeah, stretched out.  There's no, you know, it's hard for them to physically attack it so ...
R:  Yeah.  But there's a lot of -- mean, LA -- it -- the whole -- the whole of LA is assembled but it's hard to say one particular thing other than the Hollywood sign that would really be a -- a symbol of America.  And that seemed to be what they were trying to hit was the symbol.
L:  But see, yeah, even if they hit the symbol, I mean, what does that do to me?  They're just going [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  -- [inaudible] so, um, but yeah, it's really hard.  Also there's no subway here so they couldn't really attack a large amount of people because there's no subway really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And in New York it would have been so easy to just, um, attack the subway system somehow; the airflow or something.
R:  True.
L:  Like, here they can't really do it.  So, that's why I wasn't as scared in Chicago I was a little bit but here, no.  I mean, now I'm not scared any more.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, I think it's kind of over but ...
R:  Were you visiting in Chicago?  Or were you living there?
L:  I was living there.
R:  Oh.
L:  I just moved here a year ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN] But shortly after in New York the attacks had happened -- 'cause I was in New York too before, um, I lived in New York before also.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and I kept visiting New York every, like, four weeks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, through the weeks after the, um, attacks I was in New York.
R:  Wow, what was that like?
L:  You know what?  I think everybody was more upset than New Yorkers.  I mean, New Yorkers took it pretty easy; I think so.  I mean, they just knew that this had happened and they have to keep going now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Uh-huh.  I think they're pretty tough people.
L:  I think New Yorkers -- yeah, took it better than the rest.  I mean, people in Chicago seemed more devastated about it than people in New York.  And then I also went to the, um, you know, the site where, um --
R:  You did?
L:  -- it had happened.  And after, like, three weeks after it happened you could still see smoke coming out.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  Yeah.  Three weeks after it and everybody in, like, nearby, um, streets had to wear gas masks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Still, because, um, the air was so ... I don't know, so dirty and, um, but people were taking it pretty easy.  I was really surprised.
R:  Hm.
L:  I mean, not easy but they just knew they had to keep going and, you know [PAUSE] [MN] but ...
R:  I think that was how they kind of, uh ... that was how they thumbed their nose at the attackers, it's like saying, "We're going to keep going; you can't stop us" and -- and, um, I'm really proud of them.  I also wonder if part of it was that same thing that I mentioned at the beginning.  I mean, if you're i- if you were living in New York, you could do something.  You could, even if it was just go visit a friend who had something happen or  --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  You know --
