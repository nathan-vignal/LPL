L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello, my name is Carol.  Is anybody there?
L:  Yeah.  My name's Melissa.
R:  Oh, hi Marissa, how are you?
L:  Melissa.
R:  Oh, Marissa, I'm sorry.  What state are you calling from?
L:  Florida.
R:  Oh, I'm in Southern California, Los Angeles area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, the topic of the day they said was, do we think people would remain calm?  Or panic with terrorist information?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Did you want to initiate the conversation?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Or would you prefer I do?
L:  Um, you can go ahead.
R:  Well, uh, my opinion --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on it I think with the media, you know, radio and TV, ah, they always seem to project any new story, be it terrorism or what have you, with all the negative aspects.  They don't tend to give any calming information, you know, [inaudible] say well, you know, this is something that's happening but, you know, please public, remain, you know, calm.  They tend to show --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, pictures that are horrific, you know, bad scenes, like the New York building, consistently showing that being destroyed.  The terrorists, you know, the suicide bombers, all those type of things.  I don't think it helped people to remain calm when things of like that nature shown on TV or reported on radio or, you know, even the horrific pictures in the newspapers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It doesn't, you know, give anybody any hope. [LAUGH] It's kind of a, you know, a hopeless thing.  Um, what's your opinion on that?
L:  Um, I agree also.  I think, um, like, I talked to a lot of people online and some people, like, asked me, like, "Do you think I need to go out and get some plastic bags and duct tape off a room, because the news said so?" and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm, like, "No, I don't think so" but --
R:  Well think -- 
L:  -- I think a lot of people would panic.
R:  -- well, think back to the anthrax scare when it- -- people were even scared to handle their mail or if you handled mail in a -- a building and let's say you were working for a government agency, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and your people that, you know, that were scared --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to go to work, handle mail.  People scared to go to the post office.  [LAUGH]
L:  I would be scared too.
R:  Yeah.  So, it -- it's -- it's a, you know, unfortunately the media -- I know it's their job to get attention and get ratings and what have you, but, um, the news i- --
L:  I think this kind of stuff, they need to calm it down, you know.
R:  And -- and, you know, and then think too, you know, our war news --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just constantly showing the bombings, the people, the casualties, and keep showing the pictures of the, you know, soldiers that were lost.  Imagine how the families must felt, you know, to keep having to see repeated pictures and repeated [LAUGH] negativity.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But, um, you know, overall, you know, I think it's necessary to inform, but, you know, ther should be some type of intervention on public news shows to also have some speaker come on to try to eliminate a lot of panic if something, you know, horrible might be happening or going to happen.  You know, just a different way of presenting things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do they have a lot of terrorist fears of things going on in Florida?  'Cause I'm not aware of things going on in your state.
L:  A lot of terrorist what?
R:  Um, any type of incidents, you know, in your state?  We'll say, like, when people were, you know, here in LA they were, you know, lots of groups were opposing the war and there was riots and, you know?
L:  Um --
R:  Did they have that there?  Or ...
L:  There was some, like, anti war protests going on at the colleges like you asked.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I think about twenty five minutes from here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from where I live and I know they were doing a lot of that stuff there and some down town Jacksonville but, um, nothing like -- like, uh, any kind of attacks or anything like that.
R:  I think here in LA being w- well, the area I'm in, it's, like, right near the Hollywood area and, you know, where all the TV stations are, the news and a lot of people, you know, the protest same night of the awards.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I think we get more attention here because of, you know, the media capital.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, you know, the terrorist thing's pretty scary.  Um, when the terrorist event happened where the building, you know, got bombed in New York, ah, what was your opinion on that?
L:  Um, at first I realy didn't even know, like, what they were talking about until I got home and saw it and I was, like, just, like, in awe, like, oh, my gosh.
R:  How can anything that horrific, you know, somebody actually do -- or [LAUGH] there's somebody --
L:  I would be scared too.
R:  Yeah.  So, it -- it's -- it's a, you know, unfortunately the media -- I know it's their job to get attention and get ratings and what have you, but, um, the news i- --
L:  I think this kind of stuff, they need to calm it down, you know.
R:  And -- and, you know, and then think too, you know, our war news --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just constantly showing the bombings, the people, the casualties, and keep showing the pictures of the, you know, soldiers that were lost.  Imagine how the families must felt, you know, to keep having to see repeated pictures and repeated [LAUGH] negativity.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
