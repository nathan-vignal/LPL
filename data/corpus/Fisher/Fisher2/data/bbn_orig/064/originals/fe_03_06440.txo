R:  Hi, there.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Mark.  Hello?
L:  Hello.  My name is Terry.
R:  Oh, hi, Terry.  My name's Mark.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good thanks.
L:  Good.  So, I just keep talking now?
R:  I guess so.  Yeah, we desperately attempt to find things to say about terrorism for ten minutes.
L:  Okay.  So, should I start now?
R:  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the thing.
L:  Um, I think that, um, most of the things that they make us believe in, uh, newspapers and on the T.V. about terrorism are a bunch of bull and I think that ...
R:  Really, huh?
L:  Yeah.  I do.  I think that they're just means to scare us.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, that they'll make us buy more things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  I think that, um [LIPSMACK], you know, it's just a way to make people afraid and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it works really well, um, people get afraid very easily by the things they read.  I think that that's very true with the whole duck tape thing, it was like oh, we're ...
R:  Oh, yeah, that was crazy.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Let's all just go out and buy duck tape --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- we're so afraid, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's ridiculous and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that Americans specifically because we've never experienced anything like this before --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's like -- y- yeah, it's -- it's we haven't experienced anything like that before.  So, um [LIPSMACK], you know, we have to, uh -- you know, we all -- nine eleven was a -- a first for us.  All of a sudden we have to be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- panicky and, you know, we -- we don't know how to, um -- I don't know.  I just think that a lotta people blew the whole terrorism thing out of proportion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They get people afraid very quickly and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't hold much stock in it.  So, I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't particularly get afraid when I hear them because an Orange Alert means nothing to me, I don't know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what that means.  They're very big --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they don't give anybody a chance to, you know, even figure out what that means.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're not even telling us, they're not forthcoming.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what --
R:  No, you're right.
L:  -- what difference does it make?  Yeah.
R:  I think the risk -- the risk to any one person is terribly low.[?]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I should just keep ...
R:  No, I think ...  Yeah.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  No, no, I think you're dead right about the news, p- particularly in news reporting they've got like this -- they're -- they're desperate to make it sound as exciting and serious as possible, right?  So, they can -- whatever.  So, T.V. news, more people watch it, more people buy newspapers, whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  So, they've got this incentive to make it sound much more drastic than it is.
L:  Right.  And I think that you can understand that better maybe because --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I don't know.  I'm assuming that you might be from another country.  So, you might understand.
R:  Yep.
L:  I mean, I think that --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you have a different viewpoint on it in a way that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't as Americans.  We're so -- all we can do is think about ourselves and like we're -- you know, "How dare they do this to us" and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, "Look at our lives" and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like what about other people who have this happening all the time?  When we're on the other end of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, "We have terrorist attacks and all the time and we don't even think about it" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?
R:  No, that's -- that's -- that's very true.  I mean, I'm -- I'm from England.  A lot of -- what a lot of people said was they -- they were surprised at the strength of the American, the action because, I mean, there were terrorist attacks in London for many years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- by the -- the I.R.A.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, and -- and that was nothing compared to what they went through in Northern Ireland.  So, it ...
L:  Not to mention what we've done in Israel and to the Palestinians and what we've done --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- in Iraq --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for years and what we've done in, you know, Cambodia and Vietnam and, I mean, the list goes on and on.  Let's go back to like Nagasaki and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, we just -- we -- we create the most terrorist acts and then when three thousand people die it's a horrible thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I'm from Morocco.  So, it's a horrible thing.  But, you know, we have to look at it in a context, we have to look at why --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- people hate us so much.
R:  Yeah, that's a good point.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, you have to look at why people hate us so much and figure out like what the root of it is, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It didn't happen in the vacuum.
R:  No, that's true.
L:  Blow themselves up in a vacuum.  People don't get on planes and do that in a vacuum, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  No, this is true.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, yeah.  So, I, um -- that's -- that's my whole thought about the whole thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about terrorism.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Completely blown out of proportion and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I -- I just don't get myself afraid, I see it all the time in the news here, it's like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're still at a high alert, an Orange Alert.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What -- what does Orange Alert mean?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  It means nothing to me.  That doesn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mean anything to me.  I mean, unless you're gonna tell me what it is -- and first of all what good does that do to the American public?
R:  I don't know what human being ...
L:  So, you don't tell them why they should be afraid.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You just tell them they should be afraid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They can't stop going to work.  They don't know what's really happening.
R:  No.
L:  They don't even know what you're doing that's -- like terrorist acts in -- in Iraq and Afghanistan, you know, and w- what good is that?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What -- what good is that to do to people?  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  I think you're right.  Yeah.  I think more and more people might be coming to -- to feel the same way you do about it.  I mean, my -- my feeling is that if there was another terrorist attack people would be a lot calmer than they were the first time --
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, we just ...
R:  -- and that's -- that's always been my feeling.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We never experienced it before.  So, we had no --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know?  We're just -- we're just so raw still because ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  This has happened in other countries for ever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like America, welcome to the world!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right.
L:  You know?  Really.
R:  Yep.
L:  And welcome to the world that we've created in a lotta ways --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  And it's like even the Roman Empire fell.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's pretty scary, you know?  It's gonna happen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some time.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, it's -- [NOISE] it's -- it's just crazy in New York City.  I mean, I think that at least --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in New York there's a -- there's a ...  It's funny because it happened here -- most of -- you know, the biggest death toll happened here.
R:  Yeah, sure, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But people here are overwhelmingly against the war in Iraq.
R:  Really?  That's interesting.
L:  I mean, I find that in ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's really interesting --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because in other parts of the country that didn't experience it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're -- they're much more for the war --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know?  So, it's just ...
R:  Yeah, that certainly makes sense.  No, that's interesting.
L:  That's definitely interesting, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I was in New York last year --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the middle of last year and it was -- it was -- I was very surprised how people felt about it.  I -- I was quite surprised.  It -- it certainly wasn't true of Londoners after, um, the I.R.A. bombs in London they didn't -- they didn't take it personally in the same way at all.
L:  Right.  Well, if we have this kind of feeling like how dare people do this to us; we're the United States of America --
R:  I think that's right.  Yeah.
L:  -- if we have this sort of [inaudible] like --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we just -- no one has a right to do this to us --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and like how dare they, like this is the United States of America, don't they know who we are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's like, you know [MN], yes, they do know who we are, they know that we're the people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who have invaded and colonized and, you know, been an imperialistic country for years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [MN], yeah, I mean, I -- I just do not get myself even -- I don't even watch the news anymore.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just -- it makes me angry --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I -- I look at George Bush, I want to throw up.  So, I just can't even look at him --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- his big ears and ...
R:  Yep.  He really drives people crazy.
L:  Yeah, it does.  Yeah, he drives me crazy anyway.
R:  Yep.
L:  He just makes me angry.  As a matter of fact he wasn't even elected.  So, I'm kind of confused how he became President.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  He -- his -- his behavior is kind of strange.  I mean, he -- his behavior would fit somebody who was elected with a big majority --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which is kind of interesting.  He's -- he's never kind of reacted as you might expect to the fact that it was so close.
L:  Well, you know, if people don't write his features it's a really scary thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He does not know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he does not know how to speak out impromptu I tell ya that.
R:  Yeah.  That's a bit frightening.
L:  He's a really bad speaker.
R:  Yeah.  It doesn't inspire much confidence in him, does it?
L:  No, not at all.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  But, uh, it's a weird -- it's weird here, it's although they've got approval rating now after the war.
R:  Yeah.  That's awfully strange.  But, I mean, we won't see that for leader standing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, that -- that always --
L:  Well, you know ...
R:  -- always has that effect.
L:  But Blair has been involved in this too, which is like ...
R:  Yeah.  That's true actually.  Yeah.
L:  I don't know what's up with him.
R:  Yeah.  It hasn't -- hasn't worked the same way for him actually.  Yeah.
L:  Really?  People are against what he's doing over there?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, he had a real struggle.  I mean, both -- both within the politicians and with the public.  It was a big struggle for him to support the war.  Yes.
L:  Wow!  People -- I mean, you know, it's funny because it was a big struggle for Bush too with the media, it's so powerful in the United States --
R:  Yeah.  Oh, the media seems in favor.
L:  -- but you -- but --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- but you have a different media system there.  The media will just -- I went to marches where there were like ten -- ten thousand people and the media report like two thousand people marched.
R:  Oh, no.  Really?
L:  There was not two thousand people.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [MN] And they just totally under reported it so that you start to believe it's a country that there's only a few --
R:  Right.
L:  -- crazy people in the world who are against it.
R:  Yeah.  No, I -- I knew a lot more people who are -- who are against it.  It seems fairly balanced to me.
L:  Right.
R:  It didn't seem overwhelming at all, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, just in the land of the people I know.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes I -- I consider moving to Canada I have to admit.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yep.
L:  Every now and then I think well, maybe -- maybe this isn't the country for me, you know?
R:  No.
L:  Uh, 'cause I just -- it's so hard, you know?  Even -- you know, even Clinton who was supposedly so much more like, you know, liberal, he still -- he even was dropping huge amounts of bombs on different countries and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  Even he, you know ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  The terrorism of this country is perpetrated.  Like one man's terrace is another man's freedom fighter, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good one.  Yeah.
L:  It's like what -- what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- isn't war terrorism, you know?  I don't know.  I think war is terrorism, a form of terrorism --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, all this talk about, uh, when they were bombing Afghanistan, "Well, we're really taking care of all those women in Afghanistan" and they've been wearing [inaudible] for years, no one cared.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You mean to tell me the marines are on a feminist mission in Afghanistan?  Please.  Please.  They don't care about the state of women, you know?
R:  No.
L:  So [LIPSMACK], I don't even know how long we've talked I have to be honest.
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do they -- I -- I don't even know how this works.  Do I just keep talking?
R:  Sure, yep.  Yep.  I don't -- don't know 'cause we must be close to the end.
