L:  Hi, this is Julie McCleary.
R:  Hi, this is Kristen.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Real good, thanks.  So, how do you feel about the terrorism attacks?
R:  Terrorism attacks?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know, like ... I feel almost like it happens everywhere else, like, you know, I'm not really afraid of it happening, like, right where I am.
L:  Even after nine, one, one?
R:  What was that?
L:  Even after nine, one, one?
R:  I mean, I am afraid but, I mean, like, I know that it can happen but I just -- it just seems, like, surreal kind of, like -- 
L:  Where do y- -- what city do you live in?
R:  Columbus, Ohio.
L:  Okay, I'm in Dallas, Texas.
R:  Okay.
L:  And even though we're a major metropolitan area, I just don't see it happening here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I see if it's happening, it's going to happen, [PAUSE] ah, more in the, you know, the New York, Washington, DC, all that area.
R:  Yeah.  But, I mean, even, like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the little small stuff, like, I know it can happen but I just don't feel like ... I don't know, I feel like the chances of it happening to me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are, like, really slim.  But it's kind of scary now because, like, th- -- none of the states have any funding any more for, like, a- -- like, they expect the states, like, each state to raise its own, like, security or whatever, but then the state, like, I saw in the news they're saying, like, how can we when, like, there's no additional funds coming from the government at all.  And, like, everyone's so in debt that it seems, like, almost impossible to, like, try and, like, protect yourself extra than we already are.
L:  I don't know that, um, when it went to orange the other day or -- yeah from yellow to orange the other day, um, I know the Dallas area -- I -- our airport, they [MN] -- they cut off -- you can't, you know, park right in front of the -- the airport.  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they watch people that are coning in, um, they've -- all of the events like our Maverick's games and stuff like that, they've put triple the amount of security on.  So, it almost makes you -- it -- you kind of get really scared because they're putting so much emphasis on putting extra people and I -- I used to -- I don't know, right now I'm unemployed, but I used to work in the hospitality industry and I used to work by Dallas Fort Worth airport and it's -- it's amazing what happens when something like this goes on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  People don't come in.  People -- people don't fly.
R:  Like, I don't, like, it hasn't affect- -- like, I've flown, like, a lot since +September -- September eleven then, like, I guess it just doesn't scare me because I just think, like, what are the chances, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  See flying I think people should be doing that.  I think that -- that part I don't -- see I see more peop- -- I see s- ... [MN] a terrorist doing more at an airport or somewhere where there's a -- a big group of people.
R:  Yeah, but, like, it seems, like, why would they focus on an airport even now, like, well, because the security is so high, like.  I feel like they're just going to -- I feel like they're going to do, like, a bunch of, like, little small stuff that seems, like, impossible to prevent.  You know, what I mean?
L:   See that's what they're doing.  Look at all these bombs that have gone off in, you know, other countries right now.
R:  I know, like -- like, especially Israel but that's just because of, like, Palestine and Israel, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my friend -- my friend is going to Israel [LIPSMACK] in, like, a week for this, like, free program because she's Jewish.  And, like, I don't know, it just freaks me out because recently there've been, like, so many more attacks.  But she knows, like, not to get on any busses and stuff like that.  Because that's usually where it always happens.
L:  Yeah, but they're starting there and I think it's going to hap- -- um, I'm -- I really honestly believe the US will be attacked in the next six months.
R:  Yeah.  I think they will too.
L:  I don't think it's in next couple of months.  I think it'll be in the next six months.  I really do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, um, the whole thing, you know, went to war but, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] we -- [MN] +Hussein, we have not been able to capture and, um, oh, the other guy, um, --
R:  Well, I don't think, [MN] Saddam --
L:  -- Bin Laden.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's still out there.  I think they will definitely and I -- I mean definitely put terrorist threats out on the United States because they're pissed.
R:  Well, I don't think, Saddam, like, has any power any more.  If anything I think he's focusing just on, like, hiding out.  I think it's more just like other Is- Israeli than, like --
L:  But how do we know that how many people he's --
R:  -- other people -- 
L:  -- still doesn't have in the US?
R:  Yeah, that's true.  But I do think, like, not even them, like, there's so many other people that, like, hate Americans.  I just feel like really there's nothing we can do about it right now,
L:  No, there's not.
R:  Because so many people hate us, like, except for just, like, try and protect ourselves as -- as much as we can.  And then hopefully in, like, ten years, [LIPSMACK] like, everything will pass and, like, things will change.  Because, like, the Israelis hated us so much because we had troops over there in the Middle East, when they thought, like, what we should -- we didn't have any right to.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  And now after this war, we're not going to any more.  It's basically, like, okay, like, we're just going to set up y- -- like, a democracy hopefully --
L:  Right.  And just take out -- yeah and take out the troops.
R:  And then -- yeah.  And then hopefully, like, it'll pass.  You know what I mean?  [LIPSMACK] And they'll stop hating Americans.  Because, like, we're just like, "Why do you hate us?"  We don't even know why.  I don't know.
L:  It's because of their leadership.  And it's always been because of their leadership.  And you've got to ... you know, there's half of them that know -- know the truth, and half of them that don't.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's always going to be that battle.  But the ones that do, I mean, there's more that do that don- -- than don't and I -- I think when we went to war it was well worth it because we were able to get, [MN] you know, [MN] we were -- be able -- we were -- we could change over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Otherwise, uh, [SIGH] I don't know, um ...
R:  I mean, I think it was worth it, because otherwise --
L:  I definitely do think it was.  I'm still upset because, yeah, we have not find -- found any of these nuclear things.  I mean, wh- uh, [SIGH] [MN] and you know, that's what a lot of the people are saying.  Okay, well, we went to war, we didn't find the +nuclear bombs and all this stuff but --  
R:  I know.
L:  -- look at the peace we've brought.  Look at the peace. And look at, you know, lo- look what we've brought.  And these people are so happy.  And we will find him, I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] he was  --
R:  -- even know if they're, like, so happy, like, they still shooting at us.  But eventually, like, it's just gonna, like, fizzle out and stop.
L:  -- but some of them are and some of them aren't.  A majority of them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are very happy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You've got -- so, you've got, um, +Hussein's, followers who will always be.  I mean, those people are going to be there for -- forever.  I mean, he had a big impact on that country.  So, y- -- I mean, you've gotta [SIGH] basically figure out, you know, when they all start seeing the light and they see the difference going on in their country, they're all going to start to turn.  [PAUSE] I don't know, that -- I could be wrong on that.  I di- -- that's just my feeling.  [NOISE] Are you there?  Hello?  [PAUSE] Hello?  [NOISE] Hello?
