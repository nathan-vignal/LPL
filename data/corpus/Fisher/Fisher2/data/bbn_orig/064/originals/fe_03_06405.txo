R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Linda.
R:  Hi, I'm Ann Marie.
L:  Hi, it's nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you too.
L:  Um, I guess the topic is on, um, how we would react if there was a terrorist attack.
R:  Correct.
L:  Okay, do you want to go first?  Or do you want me to?
R:  You can go first.  Go ahead.
L:  Okay, okay.  Um, I think at first I would be very scared but probably for me, I would probably pray first.
R:  I could -- I would agree with that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would probably go freaking out first and realize I had kids with me too though. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Try and remain calm [LAUGH] around the kids, and yes, of course praying.  That would be the next thing.
L:  Right.
R:  My mom would be in my head going, "Pray!"  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Exactly.  I think then for me probably, like, uh, I don't know, duty might kick in, like, you know, what -- what to do now, what -- what's the best thing to do, you know.  Stay calm, stay steady --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, gosh, that would be -- I don't know how I would -- but still, to say that's what I'd be doing, who knows?
L:  Right.
R:  To when it actually happen.
L:  Right.  Right.  My, uh, son -- my oldest son was in Israel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, 'bout eight months ago and there were terrorist attacks there when he was there and --
R:  Is he in the military?  Or is he just over there visiting?
L:  He was over there visiting.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  He went over in, like, a -- a missionary capacity --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to just kinda support the Israeli people because, you know, things wer- -- things have been so bad there lately.  And, uh, it was, you know, it -- it was, like, a lot of prayer for us, and like I said, there were bombings while he was there.  You know, fortunately he came back safely but it was a thing kinda where he just, you know, we just kinda realized in a situation like that, nobody's really safe then in America.  People think they're safe but really we're not.  But I really think, especially in America, by the way we do think, that we would probably just panic, you know --
R:  Yes, I mean --
L:  -- at first.
R:  -- that's what we said back in nine eleven, nobody thought that would ever happen.
L:  Right.
R:  And look what happened.  
L:  Right.
R:  So, and now since it has happened [LAUGH] ...
L:  It's a whole different thing.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  But I think we've gone back to relaxing again thinking --
L:  I think you're right.  I think we have.  I think we've kinda gone back to our daily lifestyles and, you know, I don't know, I think -- I think for me though, I'm a lot more aware of things around me than I used to be.
R:  Yes.  I would say that's true too.  I mean, I know when -- after all -- that every time I get on a plane, I freak out.  [LAUGH] I hated to fly be- beforehand.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I never liked flying.  And then I was -- at the time it was all happening, I was living in Alaska, and I ended up flying a week after it happened.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  So, I was just like -- a week and a half -- it was a week and a half after it happened, I'm like, "I don't want to get on the plane".  And of course everybody's, like, it's the safest -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thing right now, nothing's going to happen to you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they're so [SIGH] ... and I'm like, "Oh" -- and I hated to fly beforehand.  And of course flying with my kids [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] -- you know, how [several inaudible words].
L:  That's a whole different thing.  Now, for me though, the flying -- I've flown twice since nine eleven, and it hasn't really affected me at all.  I think -- I don't know, I have more of a feeling of security now probably [LAUGH] than I did --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- flying before because of all the added security measures that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they've taken now.
R:  Right.  Right.  I -- I don't know, I just never liked to fly beforehand.  They just always gave me a thing about flying.  But, ah, just -- I even freaked out -- I mean, I had to be calm anyway with my kids.  My husband's, like, "Don't you start freaking out 'cause you've got your two kids on plane".
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and of course both of them think it was most exciting thing.
L:  What ages are your kids?
R:  Right now well, let's see, now we have a seven, and a two and a half year old.
L:  Oh, my goodness they're young.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah, so it was, like, you had to really put on a straight face for that.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, my daughter always loved flying.  My ol- -- I mean, my little one -- my oldest one has been flying since she was one years old.  So ...
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  My husband's in the military so we move a lot.
L:  Ooh!  Well, where do you live now?
R:  I'm in Tennessee.
L:  Oh, you're in Tennessee now?
R:  Yes.
L:  Ooh! 
R:  So --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- any my family always on the East Coast.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  So ...
L:  So, to see them, you have to fly?
R:  Yes.  Well, now I can drive if I want to so [inaudible] -- 
L:  That's true, with you being in Tennessee.
R:  Yeah, so, but yes.
L:  I think it has definitely changed things.  And I've -- I've noticed that, you know, I was talking to my mom today and she even said how yesterday our country's back on alert again.
R:  Exact- yes.
L:  And, you know, there's -- there's been more threats against us and stuff.  And I know for me, it's just -- I -- it's kind of a thing where I don't sit and worry about it, I just, you know, [LAUGH] like you said, in the beginning for me I just -- I just pray that, you know, God's will be done, you know, and that if somebody needs help through that, or I do, or whatever, you know, that -- that everybody'll just draw together and help each other --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and hopefully not, you know, throw everything into a sheer panic.  But I do think in our county that is -- I -- I do think that's what would happen again if -- if these terrorist attacks start again.
R:  Yeah, for me it's my husband leaving.  [LAUGH] I pray that this stuff gets back to normal.  I don't want my husband leaving again -- going.
L:  I don't blame you 
R:  So --
L:  So, was he sent overseas this last time?
R:  No.  No he wasn't.
L:  Oh, thank goodness for that.
R:  He -- he actually will be going very soon though.
L:  And he'll -- he'll be heading over to where?
R:  Ah, I don't know -- I can't -- I'm not told.  It's to need know basis so ...
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  So ...
L:  Oh, my goodness, that's hard.
R:  So, [SIGH] and, you know, when things are supposed to be a little better now, even though with the suicide bombings over there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're supposed to be a little bit of a peace area so, I'm hoping things don't act up again, that things will get worse.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  I know it's a grave concern I think for everyone here though.  For all of our people who are, you know --
R:  Yeah, and after they -- that warning yesterday, everything bumped up I'm wondering if everyone's not freaking out thinking something's going to happen like again, like nine eleven.
L:  Right.
R:  Because I saw that and I was, like, "Okay, what's that mean?"
L:  Right!
R:  'Cause I guess -- suppose that when nine eleven happened, they supposedly had stuff knowing something would happen --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- they didn't know when -- 
L:  -- see that's, yeah.  That's -- it's -- it's -- oh, man, I don't think anyone ever anticipated what did though.  That it would be that elaborate of a plan.  I would hope that our le- -- our nation's leaders now are a lot more prepared as far as, you know, let's take the threat seriously, you know.  But I kinda wonder if -- if the American people haven't kind of, you know, well, yeah, we go on yellow alert or whatever and it -- but it'll go back down, you know.  I know for me, I'm -- I'm usually aware of it, you know.  It's like, well, if, you know, if they say there's an alert, then you better listen, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, before I didn't really care about the news but lately now I'm listening thinking -- waiting to hear what's happening, wherever and [PAUSE] just concerned.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely, especially with your husband being in the military.  That's even, you know, you [LAUGH] have, like, a double concern, you know.
R:  Well, from the job we came from there was no worry about him going anywhere.  But moving here, there is now.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, my husband is a mailman, and that -- that was very scary when that anthrax scare --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- went through because the post office just was not prepared for anything like that at all --
R:  That's what my father in law does.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  And he said -- he said it was really weird because th- that just, you know, they're, like, delivering this mail, I mean, you know, they never stopped delivering.  And it was just, like, "Well, what are -- what do we do?" I mean, you know, because nothing really was in place so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think it's been really good too in a way that that happened, 'cause I think it made everybody realize there better be heightened security, you know.  Our county's been so open for so many years to just anybody, you know.  I guess that's why we're free, you know.  [LAUGH] But I don't know, for me that's, like, I don't -- I -- you know, I just recently flew a couple of weeks ago and I had to wait in security for, like, an hour and a half and I didn't care.  It didn't bother [LAUGH] me, you know.  I would rather go through the security and know that measures are being taken to keep us safer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than not have any at all [MN] like it used to be.
R:  Yeah.  I am like that too but when you're standing in line with two kids.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's true [LAUGH].  That's true.  My kids are both grown so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't have that [LAUGH] any more.  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  Yeah.  No, I do like [several inaudible words] you see the people standing there with their guns and the -- whoever the armed forces, or whoever is standing there at the time.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] So, and all the taking off -- yeah, I know when I -- uh, last time my folks, um, before I left Alaska they came to visit -- my brother had to take off his shoes and do all that stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Picking and choosing people to open up their bags, and of course my brother was one of the ones that got snagged.
L:  Oh, no!  [LAUGH]
R:  So, he was, like, "I did this just to come visit you".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, they're just making sure you're not carrying anything you shouldn't.
L:  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're just keeping everybody safe including him.  But I know it is different.  It -- it's, you know, de- definitely living in a different time, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  I almost think -- I -- I always wondered, you know, I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really glad that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my kids arent real small 'cause I always wonder how it affects them, you know.  'Cause they think of this world as such a safe place for 'em, you know.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  I think that's hard as parents too, to explain that to them, you know.
R:  You know, that's how we were raised though; we didn't expect any of this stuff to happen.  [NOISE] 
L:  No.
R:  Okay, I'm sorry!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [NOISE] I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying right here!  Yes, I know, we were raised that way thinking we're, you know, everything's safe and open and ... [NOISE] and nowadays you gotta be scared [NOISE] of anything.
L:  Right.
R:  Trying to let my kids know they shouldn't go up talking to strangers.
L:  Yeah.  And that's -- tha-
