L:  Hi, I'm Jill.
R:  Hi, I'm Vanessa.
L:  Hi Vanessa.
R:  Hi, how you doing?
L:  I'm doing well, thanks.  How are you?
R:  Okay.  And guess, um ... I believe the public have a right to know what's going on within a company.  
L:  You do?
R:  I mean, within [NOISE], um ... the country.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, you think it's fine for all criminal trials to be -- a- any criminal trials to be televised?
R:  [NOISE] Not -- well ... yeah.
L:  Well, I mean, I -- I can see what -- what you're saying because I -- I think there is a danger in keeping things that the public have an interest in secret 'cause they -- then power can be abused and you don't know what's going on.  I just think that, especially when it's like, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, a violent crime or definitely a sex crime, then I mean ... how much of the -- do the victims suffer maybe if --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  
L:  -- if it's publicized.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and i- in that case when a victim ... [LIPSMACK] if it's under age --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if the victim is under age, then if they can protect that victim identity --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't have a problem with the, um -- the, um, trial being televised.
L:  Okay, but on- only if the person's underage.  Is -- I mean if it was like, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a twenty year old woman then, like -- then she should have no special protection?  The trial should just go ahead on TV?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's -- I -- I'm surprised.  I -- I don't agree.  I --
R:  [NOISE] You don't agree?
L:  No.  I ... [LIPSMACK] I think it's fair enough for the court record to be open to the public after the trial is finished.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  But maybe not a live trial.  Um and I think there has to be some restriction on it.  I don't know.  I just -- I mean, I -- I have friends that, um, have been in var- -- in legal trouble and -- and whatever and some of them sound guilty and some of them sound innocent but the more publicity the trial gets the more the person who's accused is, like, believed to be guilty regardless of what happened to the trial.  I mean ... I don't know, I mean --
R:  But --
L:  -- I don't know the ins and outs of the O.J. case for instance but --
R:  But then you have -- then you would have a incident when -- okay, say, the trial doesn't get any, um ... pub- pu- publicity, right?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And say the guilty person has a lot of money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then that trial would get swept under the, um, the rug while nobody really care about the outcome.  Don't nobody really know and that guilty person, the money would talk for them.
L:  That is a definite danger, I -- I ag- --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah and --
L:  -- I agree with what you're saying.  I don't know whether televising is the way forward.  I mean, personally I would -- I would like if -- like it if we had a -- a real investigative press.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I mean, it should be like -- journalists should, like, you know, report on that and -- and dig that kind of stuff up but right now you're absolutely right.  Someone with money can kind of just keep things quiet.
R:  [NOISE] Ex- they can get away with murder. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, totally, yes.
R:  They can get away m- -- and -- and then least this way if they do ... win that trial, at least w- -- you know, we would know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we can -- cause I mean, the trial is one thing but when -- when you won a case -- like, say, for instance, a person robs somebody --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they got away and they were guil- -- and they were guilty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they still walked away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if there wasn't any p- media about any, we would never know about this person.  
L:  This is true but --
R:  So --
L:  -- just imagine a similar case where someone's accused of robbing someone and they're actually innocent and they go through the trial and they're found innocent, is there not the same danger that that person will, you know, you -- you can look at it saying, well, you know, a guilty person might get away with things and they won't get away with it if it's on TV but, I mean, doesn't that, like, endanger the innocent as well?
R:  Mm.  I -- I guess but I'm thinking more to the sense of ... I understand your reason but I'm thinking more to the sense of the more attention to it, y- you'll have a hard time you know?  If you're guilty, you're guilty.  If you innocent, the truth will come out.  
L:  Right.
R:  Have you ever seen a television trial?
L:  Uh, I don't think I have.  I -- I'm trying to remember.  I mean, I -- I've -- yeah, I guess they put parts of it on the news so I must have seen that.
R:  I think it's, um, Court TV ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- when they all have trials.  I never actually sat and watched one --
L:  No.
R:  -- but they'll have the whole trial on -- on TV and you're able to see it and to judge and -- pr- y- you- you- you be able -- should be able to know ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  I mean, I -- I guess in a instance if the woman ... [LIPSMACK] was raped --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but if her identity was protec- -- was protected --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we still need to be aware of ... who the person was.  
L:  I guess so.
R:  I mean, you know, they accuse --
L:  I guess so.  Um, I don't know.  I mean, person- -- I happen to know somebody who was convicted of, um, [LIPSMACK] abusing children.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, went to jail for it and everything but whilst he was in jail, the woman that accused him of the -- of the -- of, um, [LIPSMACK] abusing her children, was found to be mentally ill.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  And she was a -- basically she was a crazy woman --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who has, like, you know, just accused him to get back at him.  Um, but that's it now.  He's like a marked man.  There's no way that that verdict is going to be overturned.  Well, you know, he has a hard time in life now because everywhere he goes people think he's a child sex offender which --
R:  [NOISE] Well, he didn't try to appeal the case?
L:  Sorry?
R:  He didn't try to appeal the case or --
L:  Um, I think he did but, you know, failed or --
R:  And he still lost?
L:  No, so I mean, I don't know the details.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's not someone I know well but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's someone I -- you know, I'm acquainted with and I -- I do -- I can und- -- I mean, even if -- even if he is guilty --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- which I -- I personally don't think he is but the point is, people can be falsely accused and especially when it's a crime like that I'd just be very worried that -- that, you know, the wrong people would get the wrong reputation and stuff.  But I mean, I -- I guess I can see what you're saying.  It sounds to me like you're saying that you're more concerned that too many guilty people are getting away with things rath- --
R:  [NOISE] Exactly because ... innocent people you rarely -- they rarely, you know, get -- get away with -- with murder.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, you know, they rarely -- I mean, innocent people are innocent --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but you always see guilty people getting away with murder.
L:  I don't know how many people really do get away with it.  I mean, if you look at the proven population in this country.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You know the United States has a greater percentage of its people in prison than any other country in the world.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  So, it's like we're putting all these people in jail, I mean, I'm sure most of them are guilty of something but we still have crime.  We -- you know, I -- I can't believe there are that many people that are innocent that are getting away with things given that we are jailing so many people.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  So, I mean, I'm ... more -- I -- I'm not too worried that too many innocent people are getting away with things.  I -- I totally do understand what you're saying about the money thing though because that is -- that's is a problem.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, like you said, look at O.J.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I- ...
L:  But then, was his trial on TV or not?  I mean, I remember seeing parts of it.
R:  [NOISE] Um, I don't -- I don't know if his trial was on TV but I know like ... his, um, a lot of the, um -- the court was -- everything that was going on, it was always in the paper.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So, we as the public was kept informed.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And just -- and any crime in general, we still need to know what the heck is going on, because I mean, how would like it if somebody lived next door to you was accused of a -- -- of a cr- -- of a crime of robbery?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Shouldn't you need to know?  
L:  I need to kn- --
R:  Whether that person is innocent or guilty you still need to know who the heck you're living next door to.
L:  Yeah but I -- I feel like if the justice system is working correctly --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I should be able to just trust that, you know, the police and the courts are dealing with it and I only need to know if they're found guilty.
R:  [NOISE] And here's another to do with it and then you got all these -- these child molesters --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so then you tell me you have, um, somebody that go to trial for child molesting --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and say they win the case, right?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then they'll move, uh, into a different state.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Shouldn't you be able to know?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  That is a really difficult one.  I'm sure if I had kids I would say yes I should be -- I should know, definitely, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't have kids so it's kinda -- but, uh, I don't know.  
R:  Do you have little -- 
L:  I just have a real problem with the way --
R:  -- you have, uh, little cousins or nieces?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- look from, you know --
L:  Yeah, I just feel like there has to be a better way of ... uh you know, I feel like there are things that are not done that should be done.  Like, I feel there should be more ... [SIGH] I don't know, treatment or something 'cause I mean, the truth of the matter is when somebody has molested a child, they're likely to do it again.  I mean, there doesn't seem to be much but ...
R:  Exactly but they're also --
L:  [SIGH] We don't seem to have come up with a good way of protecting kids against them and --
R:  Yeah, they- they're ... less likely to do it if they know you're watching.
L:  Mm, that's true.  That is true.
R:  You know, if -- if they know you don't know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you don't know to -- to be aware.
L:  That's correct, yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] So, they're going to continue -- you know, they're just gonna pack and move.
L:  But, I mean, that's kind of a different issue from the whole televising thing because I would say don't televise the trial but if they're found guilty, let's know about it.  But you're saying --
R:  [NOISE] But I don't --
L:  -- we should know right from the -- as soon as they're accused we should be able to watch what's going on.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but and then see, the thing with the trial being televised, we ha- -- we ha- -- we --
