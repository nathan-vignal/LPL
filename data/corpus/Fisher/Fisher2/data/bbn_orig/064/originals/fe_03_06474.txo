R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  This is Louise Worry and we're on the Fisher telephone speech study participation ...
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and [LAUGH] I'm from North Dakota and the question they just asked us to talk about was criminal trials: should they be televised?
L:  Mhm.  Uh, yes, I'm, uh -- I'm Mary and I'm from, uh, Washington.  Uh, formerly from North Dakota and, uh, uh, yes, uh, I -- I think they should be, uh, televised.  How 'bout you?
R:  Well, some of them should be televised but when it gets like the O.J. Simpson type trial that drug on for a year or two, [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a bit much, don't you think? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was.  It was.
R:  But --
L:  But, uh, they're kinda interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You -- you learn a lot.
R:  A person does but, you kn- -- the thing that is so sad over so many of these is ... how it's obvious that they are probably guilty.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, are you thinking about O.J.?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but that -- that's for an instance but because of all the, um ... the laws or whatever they have that you can't examine this purse or examine that before it comes up to trial, you know, it's always thrown out.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well, I wonder if they're gonna have that, um, [LIPSMACK] ... uh ... that -- what's that one in California [inaudible] --
R:  Well, the- -- the [inaudible] says, um, man that, uh, supposedly killed his wife and unborn son.
L:  Yeah, it's been on TV so much, you know, he's, uh -- he's almost, uh, considered guilty by TV, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, of course, I don't know if he is or not actually but ... but, uh, I wonder if they're gonna televise that.  It should be pretty interesting because you learn a lot about how the courts work.
R:  Yeah, if they don't televise it, it'll probably be on, like, a Nightline or some of those half hour or hour shows in the evening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- going over what happened during the day.
L:  Well, do you watch, uh, those, uh, televised, uh, criminal trials on TV, you know?  On here we get it on channel twenty -- fifty one.
R:  Well, [LAUGH] I -- I'm from North Dakota also --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and out here [SIGH] in the rurals we just get, um ... my husband gets -- has the -- the satellite dish --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he gets the history channel, the western channel [LAUGH], the weather channel --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- o- otherwise we just get ABC, NBC, Fox.  
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Probably five channels and public [inaudible] television.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  Well, that's really enough.  But --
R:  If, well, [LAUGH] some days it's too much because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] i- it's not the -- the actual trial but it's the +pretend trials that go on day after day after day with all the -- the committing of crimes and whatever.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Is there any good show on there any more?  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  Not that -- that I've seen lately. [LAUGH]
R:  Got to be so selective and -- and sometimes there's nothing there on the primetime so you just as well turn it off.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  Um, by the way, what town are you from in North Dakota?
R:  Uh, Manangle[?] which probably nobody ever heard of. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I -- I haven't.  Uh, I'm --
R:  South of Jamestown about fifty five miles.
L:  From where?
R:  Jamestown.
L:  Jamestown?  Oh, yeah, mhm, I know where that is.  Well, have you ever heard of Munich?
R:  Munich, yes.  There was a -- [LAUGH] the ones that always gotta win that basketball tournament every spring?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, is that right?  [LAUGH]  Well, I haven't been --
R:  They -- they have pretty good teams out there, yes, they do.
L:  I haven't been there for so many years I didn't know that.  Um ... but I guess we're supposed to be talking about something else. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, uh, we're talking -- supposed to be talking about the -- the criminal trials.  If they should be televised.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [SIGH] I gu- -- I mentioned before, you know, to some degree but not coverage day after day after day.  It gets so very old.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  So, you're like, uh, I think too what you said, you get Fox?
R:  Yes, uh-huh.
L:  On TV?  You know, they just run the same stuff.
R:  But, you know, when they have these televised every day another thing I noticed that there were a lot of other ... newspaper type headlines that were almost completely ignored when they had the, um -- the, um ... oh, some of the things like in New York city so ... um --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- probably if they are televising these criminal trials also in that same manner that they are also ignoring a lot of other news items that could ... we could be made aware of.
L:  Well, that's true.  I noticed that, uh, like, when the war was going on ... well, you didn't really hear much about anything else.
R:  No.
L:  Um --
R:  No.
L:  -- sometimes you turn on, um ... oh, like, um, CNN -- do you get CNN?
R:  CNN?  Yes.  Uh, it is on.
L:  So, they, uh -- they have, uh --
R:  On my husband's cable. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they have, um, more news -- newsy stuff in, like, box[?] and --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I'm wondering what channel it will be televised on too if they have some of these criminal trials that are coming up.  Does Fox usually do them all?
L:  Uh, well ... I think so.  I don't remember now where, uh -- which one O.J. was on.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, probably they share other primetime like, who knows?  Take turns.
L:  Yeah, but, um, right now it's channel fifty one.  I don't know which number that is that has trials.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't watch it actually but I know it's there.  Um --
R:  Yeah, um -- we're on direct TV.  It's, uh, the cable that my husband gets.  I don't know which one you're on but --
L:  Uh, well, this is, uh, Prime Cast they call it.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, we have, uh ... I don't thi- -- we don't, uh, don't have ninety nine channels but we have ... uh, because some of 'em are blank in there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But we have -- must have ... well, I don't know, forty five or so.
R:  So, they actually have a station then that does the criminal trials all the time on there?
L:  Yes, uh-huh.  Um --
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH] I guess I'm out here in the boonies in I know where. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but I haven't been watching it so I don't know really what's on but I've seen, um, uh, this girl on, um -- oh, she's on CN- -- on Larry King every n- night lately.
R:  Oh yes.
L:  Th- -- do you watch Larry King?
R:  [LAUGH] Very seldom.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm pretty selective about my shows. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Get the news and weather.
L:  Well, anyway, uh ... they go over and over and over about this Lacey Peterson ...
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  And she is, uh ... she is a lawyer.  I can't think of what her name is but she's a lawyer on this -- this channel that, uh, has, um, th- the, uh, trials --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- all day long, you know?  So --
R:  No, I -- I didn't realize that there was a station that covers them all day long.  Then how many different trial cases do they have on at a time, or during the day?
L:  Well, I don't really know 'cause I don't pay that much attention.
R:  Oh, yes.  Can't blame you. [LAUGH]
L:  I should, uh ... probably do that but, uh ... I have other things [LAUGH] to do besides that -- sit and watch that.
R:  But, yeah.  You know the -- the actual trials, I'm not sure if the actual ones should be televised but the, uh -- the recount of the day or whatever.  The summary?
L:  Mhm.  Well --
R:  Probably would --
L:  -- I -- I would kinda like to watch --
R:  Oh, you do?  
L:  -- real trials, yeah.
R:  Fr- from the beginning what each one says, huh?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Uh, if it's interesting, it could take up part of your day but, uh, of course, most of 'em are probably not that interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh --
R:  Yeah, I -- I wonder how they select also which ones that they are gonna televise.
L:  I don't know.  [PAUSE] I don't know.  I should watch that channel, um, so I can see more about it.  Uh, I was wondering what they were gonna -- what subjects they were gonna have because I was hoping they wouldn't call me on sports 'cause I don't know much about sports.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, they've had some interesting ones but I have -- [LAUGH] I've been missing the calls when they came in last week.  My son had this ... uh, bad accident here on the farm and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  -- so I was at the hospital and stuff but, um ... 
L:  Wh- wh- --
R:  -- so I didn't -- didn't get to participate last week when th- -- when the calls came through and I didn't realize until today when I rang back -- you know, they gave me the number to call here about this criminal trials and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- whatever?  [LAUGH] And tried to contact me again.  That I had to use a PIN but I never got the PIN on my internet and you have --
L:  Oh, you didn't?
R:  -- to use your PIN number to get into it to begin with so --
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I hope your, uh, son isn't ... uh, badly hurt?
R:  Uh, he's coming along pretty good, yes.  He, uh -- he won't be able to work on the farm here but --
L:  Oh.
R:  And I hope he doesn't have to watch all these criminal [LAUGH] trials --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- that are coming up. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, he might have a lot of time for that.
R: Yes, he probably will.  He'll probably be, uh, on the -- you know, checking out things because he -- he will have a lot of time to watch television right now, so --
L:  Well, then this is your first call then, huh?
R:  Uh, yes.  This is my first call, um, on these criminal trials today.
L:  Uh, I've called, uh, once before and it was on hob- hobbies --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so that was simple.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I guess you get three calls, right?  [PAUSE] Are you still there?
R:  Yes, I am.  I thought maybe we were cut off.  Well, I didn't -- wasn't timing it how long we were on --
L:  Well, uh --
R:  -- but they said we have to speak for ten minutes.
