L:  [inaudible].
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Go ahead.
L:  My name's Nancy.
R:  And I'm Deal[?].  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too.
R:  So, criminal trials.  Have you ever watched any ... criminal trials on TV?
L:  Um, no, I haven't.  Have you?
R:  I've co- -- a few.  I haven't lasted the whole ... trial 'cause they tend to go on for weeks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ... um, like, the O.J. one ... I think I caught a lot of that.
L:  Did you?
R:  I think I did.
L:  I -- I don't -- I don't get into those.  I don't believe that they should be ... um, as publicized as they are.
R:  Do you think it's -- do you think that way because of the, um, celebrity element or do you think just across the board, like, Joe +Schmo.
L:  Jus- just across the board.  Um, you know, there's so many young children that are out there and they see what's going on and I think therefore it reflects the way that they act, um, in society.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  'Cause I tend to s- differ.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think that, um, they should be, um, on TV.  I think ... it -- it -- it's a deterrent to some people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not to everyone.  And, um ... I have young children but, you know, they don't ... they're in be- -- you know, they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in bed and they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not watching what ... me and my hu- -- my husband and I watch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... um, and ultimately it's, you know, up to the parents, hopefully [LAUGH] responsible parents --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- what their kids watch.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But not everyone's that way.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, uh, I -- don't you think -- do you think it might be a deterrent to some people?
L:  Some -- some -- to some degree, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would have to agree with that.
R:  It certainly --
L:  In that manner.
R:  -- makes celebrities outta lawyers.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And everyone needs that fifteen minutes of fame.
L:  Right, right.  Unfortunately --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- it has to come in that manner. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yes [LAUGH] that's very true and it's --
L:  But it's -- it's a big revolving door.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they take it and ... they drawl it out to ... being some big production that ... doesn't need to be drawn in that perspective.
R:  Right.  Right, it's a Hollyw- -- it's a Hollywood production.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what it ends up being but --
L:  Yeah.  There's too much drama that's added in with them.
R:  [inaudible] Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're so right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're s- -- it's the drama aspect.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's the -- I watch Law and Order.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I love that show.  I love all the -- I haven't watched The Practice very much but I love all those ... you know, lawyer ... movie -- well, not movies, but shows and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um ... [LIPSMACK] uh, um, Law -- Law and Order and all the spin offs.  I love all those.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And I love, um, NYPD Blue.  I watch all that stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I'm very into that ... that --
L:  I like the way that, you know, the regular TV shows, um, make out these trials and show how it is, but when it comes to, um, the reality, like, O.J. Simpson --
R:  True.
L:  -- with his criminal trial.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, it was just -- I think it was more drawn out.
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know, they elaborated on many things that ... probably didn't need to be.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but I mean, in that aspect, I -- I don't mind them, you know, being on.  But I think most people do take into consideration that, you know, they're here.  We might as well just, you know, see what the drama is on that.
R:  But don't you [SIGH] also th- -- I think -- well, I'll just say, I think that we are so voyeuristic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  This -- 'cause look at all the reality shows now.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  I mean, and the trials kind of feed into that a- and maybe were a precursor to -- to all these reality shows.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh -- and it's getting worse. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause now they've got a -- a new show on where the women -- it's The Bachelor and the women -- whoever he picks gets a million dollars.
L:  Right.
R:  And it creates [LAUGH] scheming.  I just find that very unethical and wrong.
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Very wrong.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so it just kinda feeds into deception and deceit.  It's --
L:  Mhm, I would have to agree --
R:  -- it's ugly.
L:  -- with you on that.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It's very ugly.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  It shows the worst kinda human nature almost there is.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, how can you be such a gold digger?  Oh, I would die if my daughter was on that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh!
L:  That's what I was thinking, you know?  I have a three month old son and I thought, "Well, my goodness, if I could catch him doing something like that I would just -- I would be beside myself".
R:  Yeah, and see --
L:  You know, so know that ... you know, they could lead to something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, into that kind of manner.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I guess it's all just ... you're gonna do whatever caused -- you know, whatever creates the most attention and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what's gonna get the most ... uh ... people to watch.
R:  Right.
L:  They're gonna do, you know, whatever it takes and ... I guess that's if they televise, you know, the criminal trials then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's gonna attract the attention and ... therefore they're gonna have, you know, everybody watching it and that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gonna be the talk in the front page of the news.
R:  Yeah, and it makes money.  Bottom line is money.
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Bottom line.
L:  Unfortunately.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I agree.  I totally agree.  Everything is ... well, just because of the way our -- our country set up every- -- the bottom line is always money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Enron thing, money. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Everybody ends up in the long run being, you know, hungry for it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they'll do anything in their power to try to get it.
R:  But there's many people that are not after their fifteen minutes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of fame and are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- nice, decent people.
L:  Yep, that could care less.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, and I -- you know, the last, like, trial sh- thing I watched was probably O.J.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  I -- I just remember seeing bits and pieces of that.  It was --
R:  And the -- right.
L:  -- you know, I'd never had it on TV all day long.  I always found, you know, I would catch up with what was going on and then I would find something else.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I wasn't glued to the television but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  And I think that's how -- 'cause my boy -- I've got three boys and my boy's really small then and I think I just watched ... 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- snips of it and then go -- go onto something else.  Watch Barney or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I didn't -- I wasn't glued t- to the TV set either but --
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I ... it's, um ... I guess just to set an example ... [LIPSMACK] that while O.J. got off but [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, [LAUGH] not everyone does.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know?  I mean, if you ... if you're that criminal -- have that criminal mindset --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then ... maybe some trials -- watching some trials where they get nailed to the wall --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where they're actually guilty.
L:  It could teach, um, a lesson.
R:  Yes.
L:  A valuable less to --
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  -- not only children but to adults. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  And they --
R:  Yes, but you know, a lot of people who don't ... who -- who are ... criminally involved or not TV watchers are off doing their drugs or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It r- -- it reaches some people though and that's a good thing I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That ... [LIPSMACK] but it -- the doc- -- the O.J. thing was way outta whack and then the Winona Ryder, um, trial, that was ... I mean, I didn't even care.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] Really didn't even care.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I d- --
L:  More drama.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and I mean, big deal.  I mean, she ... I don't know.  She tried to steal some stuff.  People do that [LAUGH] every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I mean --
L:  You know, not everybody gets a trial case and ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think just because she was popular and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- people knew who she was [NOISE] ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, she got her fame.
R:  Right, and then there's that, uh ... [LAUGH] that actor that ... [LAUGH] that got pulled over for driving drunk and they showed his ... picture.  I mean, his hair was all wigged out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I forgot who that was but --
L:  Oh, I can't remember right off hand.
R:  He, uh ... you know, that's another one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if that went to trial or not but ...
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] I don't know.
L:  I think most of it's ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  They're just out, you know, for the money.  For the fame, you know.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Publicity.
R:  But o- -- but on the other hand, um, what makes a celebrity think they're n- not gonna get caught?
L:  Right, right.  I think because they ... you know, they are a celebrity they think that, you know, "I get paid all this money and ..."
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, "I'm popular --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- so therefore, I'm invincible and it's not gonna happen to me".
R:  Yeah.  I -- yeah, 'cause it -- that's probably told to them everyday they get -- get right into ... the best restaurants.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they're shuttled right in --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- to the nightclubs as well.
L:  Above everybody else.
R:  Mhm, [LIPSMACK] yep.
L:  So, they realize that ... you know, "I'm better than everybody else.  It's not gonna happen to me".
R:  Right.
L:  No.
R:  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree.
L:  Yeah.  Now, where are you from?
R:  I'm in, uh, Nebraska.
L:  Nebraska?  I live in Ohio.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is it nice there?
L:  Um, well, today it's ... kinda gloomy.
R:  Mm.
L:  They're calling for rain for the next five days so --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  -- we're gonna have to get out the rowboats here pretty soon. [LAUGH]
R:  You will be rowing to the TV to watch the TV trials.
L:  Yes, yes.  [LAUGH] Tuning into that channel. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH] Hopefully there won't be, uh, one as big as O.J.
L:  Well, let's hope not.
R:  He had everything, man.  He just blew it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I firmly believe he did that.
L:  I think so.  I honestly do.
R:  And [SIGH] then there was that -- oh, who was that, um ... in the LA -- the LA riots, like, ten or more years ago?
L:  Oh --
R:  Uh, Rodney King?
L:  -- yes, yes.
R:  The Rodney King --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- thing.
L:  The beating.
R:  The beating.
L:  Mhm --
