R:  Hello?
L:  Hello -- hello?
R:  Hello.  I'm Mike.
L:  Hi.  I'm Misty.
R:  Hi Misty.  How are you?
L:  I'm all right.
R:  Well, sounds like we [LAUGH] -- it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- kind of a unique topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how would you respond?
R:  Um, well, I'm not really sure what exactly that this means.  You're actually being blown up or does that mean that you're just nearby or ...?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what situation would be bit, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess I would be scared. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I would panic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I woke my kids up at four o'clock in the morning to go to the basement when --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I thought a tornado was coming. [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's probably -- that's not a bad idea.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, you know, I'm not sure, you know, what you could do.  It depends on the situation I guess.  What -- what kind of terrorist thing it would be.  The World Trade Center, I guess, if you could get out, you'd run wouldn't ya? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It'd be good to do.  Ah ...  I don't know what el- -- other situation would happen.  Something at the airport or something -- I guess all you could do is do what they tell you to do.  Um --
L:  Would you be calm?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- buh, um, ah, ah -- I [inaudible] probably wouldn't be super calm but I -- I probably wouldn't panic I guess.  I'd probably -- probably, ah, freeze temporarily.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Me too.
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Ah, let's see ... um, Colum- -- I don't know -- what other kind of terrorist incident will you think of?
L:  Huh?
R:  What other kind of situation could you think of we'd be in? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  At the airport and, ah ...
L:  A car bomb.
R:  [LAUGH] Get out of the car. [LAUGH]
L:  I'd probably be, ah, calm then 'cause I wouldn't know it was there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] True.  Ah ... [PAUSE] Yeah.  Let's see ... ah, ah, what else ...  Ah ...
L:  But I know I would panic -- I always panic.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband always says --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "You're the adult here -- you need to calm down". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah.  You don't wanna do something irrational. [PAUSE] Ah ...  Um ... [PAUSE]
L:  They asked if you think other people would -- most people would be calm or if they would panic.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, ah, I don't know.  I'd probably -- I would think you'd -- you'd think, like, three quarters of 'em would be at least somewhat rational.  But, you know, maybe a quarter of 'em would be screaming and, you know, one[?] who knows what?  Um, I'd suppose -- well, it'd be like suppose -- suppose a -- some terrorist was there and, I guess, pulled a gun on everybody, what would you do?
L:  I think you'd have to stay calm there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Get down or something -- yeah.  Ah ... [PAUSE] Yeah, I don't know.  It's -- I don't have a lotta -- a whole lotta conversation on that topic.  I don't know what else to talk about. [PAUSE] Ah, is this the first time you've called -- had one of these kind of calls?
L:  Ah, I think it -- no, this is the second time.
R:  I got, ah -- it's my third. So, yeah -- you know, so far it's been pretty -- pretty interesting.  This one's a little bit more boring --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- topic wise. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Ah ... [PAUSE] S- -- yeah.  Somebody said they were just using this for -- for voice recognition software.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Ah, I don't know if that's true or not.  Yeah.  They're just doing some test on some system but -- yeah.  I- I'm not really sure [LAUGH] myself.  They just said they read that somewhere.  So, we're just supposed to keep talking is important.
L:  About a terrorist attack.
R:  Or anything.  Yeah.  I guess that's just to get us talking so ah ...  Ah, they had Bali[?] I guess now the terrorist level's up to orange again so it's higher than it -- than it's been. [PAUSE] I think the -- the next level's red, which I don't think it's ever supposed to get up to.
L:  It better not. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause -- well, red means that if -- you know, we're in a r- -- we're under imminent attack, you know, ah, r- -- under attack right then.  So, it's about the h- -- orange is their highest level for -- for normal operation. [LAUGH] But we were under that for quite a while before. [PAUSE]
L: I -- I guess it would depend on what type of attack it was.
R:  Yeah.  I -- yeah.  I don't know how -- how they rate that, you know.  I mean, it would have to be the whole country.
L:  At gunpoint, I'd have to be calm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At -- somebody[?] fly in the wind- -- or a airplane through my building --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'd panic. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, well, that's true.  Yeah.  I- it -- we should be s- -- be interested in trying to get out -- self preservation.  I don't know if that would be considered panic or not but we're just -- just common sense. [LAUGH] Doing what you have to do.  Get out of the way.
L:  Well, I kinda lose on the common sense.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  When something bad happens.
R:  Right. [PAUSE] Ah ...
L:  But I have three small children too so ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, you gotta keep up[?] for them too.  Yeah.  I suppose it depends if they're in the line of fire too.  That would -- might change things. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah ... [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What state are you calling from?
L:  Indiana. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I'm in Indiana too.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you cold? [NOISE]
R:  Ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not really.  No.  I mean weather outside --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm freezing.
R:  Huh.  Well, it's not freezing in the house but ...
L:  [MN] [PAUSE]
R:  Ah ... [LIPSMACK] Let's see ...
L:  We probably won't have to worry about a terrorist attack.
R:  Well, that's true.  We're not a real hot target.  Although, you never know.  But --
L:  But I have heard that, um, somewhere in the state they have some kind of biological stuff that they were supposed to dispose of -- they were supposed to get rid of it but they haven't done it yet.
R:  Well, it's chemical I think.  There's chemical stuff down --
L:  And --
R:  -- what -- down the air[?] [inaudible] south of Indianapolis.
L:  And, ah, there was --
R:  They've been getting rid of it.  I think it's just been taking years and years to get rid of.
L:  They were worried that they would --
R:  That's true.  Oh, that's a fact.  They make[?] these, um --
L:  -- try to -- bomb it or something.
R:  But, of course, bombing it -- it's sort of like out in the middle of nowhere.  So, I'm not sure that would -- other than making a mess -- I'm not sure that would do a whole lot.  You know, it's not like it's in a city or anything.  I think that's down in the -- in the southern -- southern part.  You know, and there's not much there.  Some arsenal somewhere.  But, yeah.  Th- they maybe could steal some of it.  It'd probably mean war but I think it's hard to do.  Ah ...  Oh, there's always the, you know -- always the airports.  I mean, anything could happen.  Then -- well, in Indianap- -- at the Indy five hundred, supposedly what -- two -- President, ah, Bush and -- and past President Clinton's supposed to be there.  So, you know, Indianapolis five hundred could be a terrorist event.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that's a national thing. [PAUSE] But, ah, yeah.  What if you were there and then suddenly these explosions started going off? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Panic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You'd have to get -- [LAUGH] trying to get outta there and hopefully not get trampled, huh? [PAUSE]
L:  [MN] But I just wonder how many people in the World Trade Centers coulda been saved if they had panicked?
R:  Mm.
L:  They kept telling them to be calm.
R:  Right.  Walk slower.
L:  Their building wasn't under attack and then ...
R:  Oh, but w- -- I don't -- didn't most the people get out that was below the plane?  I thought -- I think it's just the people above that didn't make it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know -- they -- they couldn't get out, I don't think, no matter what.  The stairs --
L:  But the people in the second building, it hadn't been --
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  I -- I don't know how many there were.
L:  -- crashed yet.  They told them not to -- not to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- evacuate the building.
R:  Right.
L:  And they --
R:  And then they had -- 'cause they had that incident once before where they weren't in as big a panic as they coulda been.  So, yeah -- oh, that's true.  Maybe a little panic might not be a bad thing.  But then there was that -- what -- that restaurant in Chicago where people panicked and, you know, crushed, like, f- -- was it fifteen people or something got crushed to death?  Trying to get out an exit for no real reason.  There was this little fire or something somewhere.  So, I guess you gotta get a -- find a balance somewhere in between. [PAUSE] Still there?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just got quiet.
L:  Trying to think of something --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to say. [PAUSE]
R:  Yep.  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  So, if you were flying the plane in Pennsylvania, what would you've done?
R:  [LAUGH] What do you mean?  If I was on that plane?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I guess I'd -- would do the same thing they would do, you know?  If you knew that they was gonna go crash into a building somewhere you'd just go up and try to get those terrorists, you know?  What've you got to lose at that point.  So, you know, yeah.  I guess, ah, w- -- let's get 'em, I guess [LAUGH] is all you could do.  But then --
L:  I think they did a pretty good job staying calm.
R:  I don't know what they've flipped[?] -- what exactly happened.  If they -- I guess they were too close to the ground.  They couldn't do anything about surviving, you know -- getting the plane going again.  But it was probably a mess. [PAUSE] But I guess at least they prevented other people from getting killed.  That's what they said, that one was going to the White House or something like that -- or the Capitol Building.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It wouldn't have been too good. [PAUSE] Mm -- yeah, huh ... [PAUSE]
L:  So, I guess all and all, I would panic and you --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- would be calm. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I -- I don't know.  Yeah.  I'd have to see the -- see the particular situation.  I'm not saying I'd be totally calm but -- yeah. [PAUSE] Yeah and I -- how -- see what others -- other terrorist situations.  Uh -- um ... [several inaudible words]
L:  I was in a terrorist situation when I went to the Dixie Chicks concert.
