R:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
L:  Hello?
R:  Uh, hu- hello?
L:  Hello.  Um, I'm Carol.
R:  Hi, I'm Francisco. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I'm calling -- I'm in -- I live in Pennsylvania.
R:  I live in LA, California.
L:  LA.  Okay, ah, how do you feel about these, ah, trials --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- being, ah, advertised on television or being shown on television to people?
R:  Well, you know, you don't want to go swimming with your pockets full of rubber bands.  You know? [LAUGH] How do you feel about it?
L:  [SIGH] Well, [SIGH] I really don't think that, um, they -- they should be televised.  Especially, um, [MN] with a family is sitting there and they -- they show expressions on the family's faces and -- I think that that's kinda like an intrusion on their privacy.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  It's like burning rubber through hair comb, kind of ... You know, don't you agree?
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Stella[?], have you ever been on a televised trial? [NOISE] 
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  But I have -- I -- I've watched 'em.
R:  Yeah, you have?  Like which one?
L:  Yes, I have.  I've watched them on television.  Ah, we had a high profile television here, um, in a neighboring state.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's -- they -- that's all they had.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- they just dug up everything in his past --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, +dragged all his co workers in and they all had to, you know, get under oath and -- and -- and you had to watch the family's expressions and I -- I didn't think that was really -- I don't that that's fair because people form an opinion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- by seeing this stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, it changes -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --the, er, the outcome of the trial --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know.  It's like, ah, interference or something.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] So, ah, what part of Pennsylvania are you in?
L:  I live in the western part of Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was, um, [NOISE] I was there once and it was so cold I needed to wear socks on my hands.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, ah, yeah, in California there's this guy.  He's, ah, supposedly killed his wife and baby.
L:  Oh, that's the -- is that the Petersen?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We been kinda -- you know, that -- that's nationwide and, of course, you know, they -- they've had that all over the television --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but they kinda hushed that up, lately.
R:  Yeah.  Man, he must have been sick or something.  Do you think he did it?  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, I think he did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think he did, yeah.
R:  Because who else would have done it, right?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  I -- I think he did but, you know, see that's it -- now, see, I have seen this, I've heard what they said.  I've already formed an opinion.  The man hasn't even gone to trial yet.
R:  Yeah, I know, huh.
L:  And I've already formed an opinion about it.
R:  That's wrong.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  See, I -- I shouldn't do that 'cause I have never even heard --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that man's side of the story.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's what I think about, you know, it being televised and stuff.  I think that, ah, all of the news like that, it -- it's kinda like, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a -- a shock.  You know, they're looking for, "Oh, what can we say now to shock these people?" or something.
R:  Mhm.  [SIGH] 
L:  And, ah, of course, you know, a lot of people do like to see that, but I'd -- I think that's just an intrusion on privacy and I think that, ah, it's -- it's none of -- it's really none of our business.
R:  [NOISE] I know. [NOISE] Yeah, well, me personally, um, [MN] I'm planning on running for president next year and, ah, [NOISE] if I was to kill my wife I wouldn't want them to televise, ah, my trial because [NOISE] that would be really bad for my, ah, you know, like, ah, people wouldn't want to vote for me then.  You know?
L:  Well, if you killed your wife --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you wouldn't have to worry about 'em voting for you because you'd probably be sitting in jail.
R:  Oh, that's true.  I didn't even think about that.  [NOISE] So, ah --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- oh, and O.J. Simpson?  That was boring.  Remember when that -- 
L:  That was -- that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that just got to be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sickening.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That got to be sickening.
R:  Argh.
L:  But, that's another thing, I -- I felt the man was guilty.  I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yes, I do.  I feel the man was guilty.
R:  Yeah.  Everybody does.
L:  Yeah.  Because he said that after the trial that he was going to take all this money and try to find his wife's killer and yah, yah, yah.  He's down in Florida playing golf.  Give me a break.
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  And who else would have killed her, anyways, you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I'd say --
L:  You know --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] or what?
L:  Yeah, I -- I think that it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was -- it -- that the way that they were slashed and stuff like that, it was, um, kinda like a rage killing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, someone that killed them was really mad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, who would be that mad at either one of them, to kill them like that?
R:  Yeah, no kidding.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Like, ah, well, you know, we do have a lot of satanic cults in LA.  So, I guess it's a slight possibility but -- but it's not likely, though, you know?  And, if a satanic cult would have killed, ah, her, um, they probably would have taken credit for it.  They probably would have said, "Oh, yeah, we did it".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  That's true too.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, um, the other day -- I'm trying to look for a job right now.  And I went and applied --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for a job, uh, that's right down the street from that house where, ah, she was killed.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  What was her name?  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  OJ's wife? [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Nicole.
R:  Oh, Nicole.  Yeah. [SIGH] So, um, [NOISE] oh, yeah.  The O.J. Simpson, that was boring though. [LAUGH] I was in high school at the time and, like, some classes -- we'd even watch it in class, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  This was on during the daytime.
L:  That was all that was on and -- and then even after they would, you know, broadcast --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, and then the news people would -- they'd have this big discussion on it and stuff and -- and the way the trial was going and stuff like that.  It -- it -- it just, you know ... It -- it was too much.  It was too much.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, if they want to show it maybe one day a week and the rest of the time, just update the people.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  You know, a little news -- a little news thing on it and then -- and I think that, uh, you know, those people kinda like gloried in that news thing.  Ah, the -- the lawyers and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- stuff.  I think they thought this was, you know, this was big stuff.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Getting their name on national television and you know.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  No kidding.  Well, like, me personally, I hate [NOISE] being in court and -- and, ah -- and, like, I can't imagine --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, actually wanting to volunteer -- people voluntarily --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- wanting to watch court, you know.  This is, like, ugh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I knew this, um -- um, well, I met this girl at a party.  And, um, she was telling me that, like, she goes to court -- to, like, the court house just for fun and, like, hangs out and watches, ah, court proceedings.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  And I thought she was sick in the head, you know?
L:  Well, a lot of people like to do that.  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of people really like to do that.  They wanna know what's going on.  Um, yeah.  There's a lot of people that do that.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] What about people --
L:  I got called for a jury trial one time.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, then, they, ah -- we -- we only had to go down, like, one day to the court house and they -- they had a plea bargain.  So, they didn't need no jurors at all and we just left and that was it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I -- [MN] I didn't care because I wasn't particularly wanting to be there.  But here in Pennsylvania, you have to have a really, really good excuse to get out of jury duty.  I mean --
R:  Yeah?
L:  I mean, really good.  Or else they won't let you out of it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, um, I've been to Pennsylvania before and it -- in Western Pennsylvania, that's where I went.
L:  Mhm.
L:  Is that like Pittsburgh or what?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Is -- is -- is that near Pittsburg, where you live?
L:  Yeah, Pittsburg's in Western Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Is there a lot of, like -- is -- are this -- -- is -- is what they say true, there are, like, a lot of Amish people and stuff out there?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, in different areas, ah, they're kinda like, um, ah, in- -- segregated, like.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They'll -- like around one town, there will be a whole lot and then, you know, around another town --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, they're -- they're not widespread.  There's a lot that, ah, live in the mountains of Pennsylvania.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there are a lot of them over at the Hesser[?] settlement over in Ohio.
R:  Uh.  Yeah, um, [NOISE] I live with a girl from Ohio.  She's from, ah, Dayton.
L:  Oh, Dayton, okay, yeah, that's Southern Ohio.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Are you talking about Northern Ohio?  [NOISE] 
L:  Northern Ohio, I'm not sure.
R:  No.  Uh.
L:  I'm not -- I'm not too sure --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when you get on over into Ohio, I'm not too sure on that.
R:  Yeah.  So, um, last time I was doing one of these phone calls, it was a -- with a -- somebody from, ah, Raleigh, North Carolina.
L:  Uh-huh.  This is the first one I've done.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  And when they said the trial thing, I was a little bit --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I thought, "Oh, man, you know, I don't even know what to talk about".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's kinda boring.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, yesterday the topic of the day was terrorism.  That one was fun.
L:  Oh, I'll bet.
R:  Because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and right now, terrorism is, like, ah, high -- high alert or whatever, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] And, ah, [NOISE] [PAUSE] the airport here in LA, it's, ah, um, [NOISE] like, supposed to be one of the top targets 'specially now that it's Memorial Day and stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Well ...
L:  Yeah.  It's just a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sad situation.  I just wished we'd keep our nose out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of everyone else's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --business and stay at home.
R:  I know.  I know, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what I'm saying.
L:  [LAUGH] Then we wouldn't have a bunch of problems.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like, it's like, well, [NOISE] like --
L:  They can't solve the problems here.  We -- we have -- we have street people.  We have welfare people, [LAUGH] you know, that -- we have people that can get no money to even go to a doctor [LAUGH].
R:  I know, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, why aren't they taking care of what's going on here in the homeland?
R:  Well, I know.  It's terrible.
L:  But, ah, yeah.  But, well, we're kinda getting off the subject but --
