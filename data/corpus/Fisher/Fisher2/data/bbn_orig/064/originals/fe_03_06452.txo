R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] My name is Melissa.
L:  [LAUGH] My name's Jeanette.
R:  Hi.
L:  How're you today?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm doing well, thanks.  How 'bout you?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  Good.
L:  Okay.  Um ... well, I didn't hear the topic.
R:  It is [SIGH] ... what was it?  Um, televised criminal to- like, trials.
L:  Okay.
R:  In particular high profile individuals. [SIGH]
L:  Okay, like the OJ ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's exactly what I thought of too.  I really can't think of any other ones.
L:  I haven't thought of any either.  Um --
R:  Um ...
L:  [LIPSMACK] Mm, I don't know.  In a way, I think the pa- public should be aware but yet some things we shouldn't.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know?
R:  Just in terms of like safety for the people involved too.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  One of my friends is on a jury right now and I think that I would be ... I don't know, kinda more apprehensive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- his safety if I knew that he was gonna be on TV or something. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true, that's true.
R:  But --
L:  Um ... I don't know.
R:  -- I didn't really watch the OJ trial.
L:  You what?
R:  I didn't really watch the OJ trial.
L:  I didn't, uh, like caught bits and pieces on the news itself.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Um ... I don't know, you get different, you know, mixed feelings on it a lot of times.  You'll hear one evidence and then you're, like, gung ho with, "He's guilty.  He's guilty" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then next minute, "Oh, well, maybe he's not". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... I don't know.  Um ... [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  One of the ones that was kind recent that just came to mind was the, um [LIPSMACK] you know the woman who ran over her husband in her car?
L:  Mm ... no, I didn't see that one.
R:  It was on -- I heard about it on the news but then in check -- chatting with people about it they said that they had watched it on court TV.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And ... I don't know.  It's kind of ... I know that some people almost get sucked into watching court TV all the time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I haven't watched TV in, like, almost five years though. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, so it -- it's ... you know, there's too much of that stuff on TV in particular and it's why I kinda got away from it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... I don't know, um, you know ... [LIPSMACK] this -- this is a hard topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think so too. [LAUGH]
L:  It really is.  Um ... I don't know.  I guess when people are -- a high profile person, you know, you don't wanna think of them another way.  Um ... you know, like whether it'd be thieving or murder or whatnot.  
R:  Right.
L:  Hm.
R:  Sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's too quiet. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh.
L:  Um, hmm ... I don't know.
R:  I guess ... uh, I guess overall, like, I don't really have a problem with cases in general being televised.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's just kind of more ... almost like, you know the news shows, like Entertainment Tonight and those kinda like sensational like things?
L:  Right.
R:  Didn't really ... I don't know, kinda blow things outta proportion but also just like ... hang --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- on everything that everyone says and ...
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
R:  I think if you were watching the proceedings and it was just the proceedings without like the commentary of other people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- one thing but --
L:  When you know it's televised like that and it's a high profile person, you do get a lot of extra stuff that's not legalities and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't even really pertain to the case so it -- it does confuse the general public.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... mm.
R:  It must be really hard to find people -- when you're talking about high profile cases --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to find people to be on the jury.
L:  I mean, that could be anything --
R:  Everyone knows everybody's business. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That could be anything from somebody that's like a superstar or whatnot to, um, even just your us- your local officials too.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know, 'cause I'm here in Ohio and I mean, you hear about, like, judges doing things and then they wanna televise what goes on in court and stuff and ... you know, if he did the crime, yeah, he's going to court for it and now we don't really need to know too much about it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, to me I think the media also uses it as a philandering tool.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And that could actually ruin somebody's ... you know ...
R:  Yeah, I think there are athletes too. [LAUGH]
L:  -- reputation.  Yeah.
R:  Somebody --
L:  And you hear about other people getting charged for things and they're gonna go to trial for it whether they're guilty or not and then you're already -- you know, you got your opinion of this person lowered and they get off, you know, with ... technicalities or whatnot but you're always gonna have it sticking in mind.
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Um ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is a hard topic.
R:  Yeah, it's really ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess I just don't really know ... that much about, like, how things -- like, how the process is to even get something televised.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm kind of curious.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think a lot of it is what the me- media goes through and then they find out -- they gotta get their --
R:  Right.
L:  -- channels, you know, like the anchor person or the reporter have to get things okayed. 
R:  Right.
L:  Um ... hm ... I don't know.  [LAUGH] Oh my goodness.  Do you guys get a lot of that televised where you're at or on your local TV?
R:  Um, yeah we do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's -- there's actually a judge who's going through a process.  I'm from Boston.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um ... [SIGH] she's being -- well, she actually just sent- stepped down from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- her position but, I mean, they showed the same clips of her kinda lashing out at ... I think it was either a la- -- a client or l- lawyer or one of ... you know, [NOISE] defendant or something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She was on the bench and she kinda lost her temper and I swear it's been on the news every single night.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's just that one scene clip of her ... you know, her quote and, uh ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it gets old real quick. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it does.  And -- and you gotta think about how -- what they're going through too, you know?  Pretty much si- sitting here thinking their life's over with so they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gonna be on the defence. 
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, take offence to everything, and it's gotta be hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, especially living in -- you know, being a high profile person for all that time and then ...
R:  Right.
L:  -- one mistake.
R:  And you can't really go anywhere without people ... knowing you too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's true.  [LAUGH] Pretty much you're labeled after that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because the media ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH] Um ... goodness.  And I know it said -- it asked if we watched any others on TV, I heard that.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Um ... the only one that comes to mind, like I said, is the OJ one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that lasted forever.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it really did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I was in school at the time when the verdict came out and we stopped school and turned on the TV.  It was, like, "Okay, this is a first". 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  We never did that, you know?
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty two.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] I'm thirty five.  I've seen -- well ... what they accept in the last five years, that's, you know, a lot off and on, um ...
R:  Mm.
L:  One comes to mind is the Peewee Herman stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And that was --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- so funny.
R:  I forgot about him.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That was a funny one though but it actually did ruin his career.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... goodness.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and Bill Clinton when he went through --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all his stuff.
R:  True.
L:  Um, there was another one.  Um ... and they drug things over that case that didn't even pertain to the allegations he was being charged on.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Um ... goodness, I don't know.  Try to think of everything I can to keep it going for ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um ... how m- --
R:  Don't you think athletes are always ...
L:  Do I --
R:  -- end up in court for one thing or another too.
L:  Which is it?
R:  Athletes?
L:  Athletes?  Yes.
R:  I don't -- I don't really follow sports but I always ... 
L:  Oh, here in Ohio --
R:  -- hear about people getting pulled over for speeding and then, you know, they have drugs in the car.
L:  Yep.
R:  It would be, like, a -- you know, it happens every single day but when it's someone high profile ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?
L:  There was a lot with the LSU students going on except our players and stuff through the years too.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  Um, over here in [inaudible] and, uh ... it's like, "We didn't need to know some of these things that were going on".  One of 'em lost their temper supposedly over a fan and it was in court, you know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then they televise that to trash the poor kid that's not even got his future yet, you know?  [LAUGH] Um ... I don't know.  The media could be --
R:  That's the thing.  Like, you gotta feel bad when it's someone ... like innocent. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  You know, 'cause, I mean ... if it's televised no matter what, like, people are gonna ... think what they wanna 'bout you and ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  And if you're found innocent, I mean, if it's televised and people know your name, you coulda been a nobody beforehand but afterwards everyone knows your name.
L:  Right.
R:  You'll have that with you forever.
L:  Yeah, and again, like they said with the high profile it's not -- it's gonna stick in your mind.  That name's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- never gonna leave for a long time. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... hm.  Goodness. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
