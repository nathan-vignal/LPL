R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  My name's Deborah, I'm in Virginia.
L:  Oh, are ya?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, I'm -- I'm Ruth in Missouri.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, how are you tonight.
L:  Oh, pretty good.  I was just eating supper.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, gee, we- well we got ten minutes to talk.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so, the -- the question is would -- would we panic in a terrorist attack?  Um, depends on the kind of attack I guess, for me.
L:  Right.  Um, you know, I'm -- I'm in a rural area and we, you know, we don't -- we're not concerned about attacks here.  Like, oh, maybe St Louis or Kansas City --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, where they had thousands of people in a stadium or something like that might get bombed or something, you know. But [MN] I'm out in the rural area, although I live in a small town of six hundred.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Well, um, you probably hear a little bit about us; I'm in the Norfolk area, which is the world's largest naval base.
L:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH] Is your husband in the service?
R:  Uh, I'm single.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  But, um, I work for the military, I'm a civilian employee for the military so, we get to hear all that goes on on the naval base.  And we've got a big aircraft carrier group coming in tomorrow so, they've been heightening the security around the naval bases and are just very -- y- yeah they tend to be very concerned anyway because of --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- such a concentration of ships and submarines here.  And, uh -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's such a big population that's involved with the navy.  I mean, we've got some armor; we've got some airforce.  But, uh, -- it's a -- a real high concentration of military in this area and we're just couple of hours outside of Washington.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, the thing with the terrorist attack around here is that we've got so much water.  You can't get anywhere without having to cross a bridge.
L:  I bet.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And, um, even when we're -- we're look at hurricanes and nor'easters and storms and things in the summer time, they talk about well, how would they evacuate the area 'cause we've got so many bridges.  Thee are only so many ways to get out of here.  And you can only west, you can't go east, 'cause otherwise you go in the ocean.
L:  Right.
R:  So, we -- we -- we have a lot of things that, um, you know, we -- we have to deal with even apart from terrorism.  And terrorist attack is the same thing, you can't evacuate the area.  So, you're -- you're kinda used to the feeling that well, you -- you have to stay put 'cause you can't go anywhere anyway so ...
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, I know it's, you know, if -- if I'd have been in New York City on nine one one, you know, I can see why or how a person could be, um, tr- -- you know, really traumatized and, um, well, you know, people were just confused about where to go and what to do.  I mean, with the subways shut down and everything and I guess that it depends, you know, where you are and -- and what happens and how many --
R:  Well, that --
L:  -- people there are and how many get hurt and ...
R:  Well, you know, at that point it was just such a stunner.  That morning to see 'cause I, um, I'd called in sick, I was feeling -- I wasn't feeling well that morning.  I'd called in sick and I had the Today Show on TV, and right about eight o'clock, you know, eastern time, they -- they came on and Katie Couric had a picture of the -- the, um, World Trade Center and said, "Apparently a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center.  We don't have any details".  And I'm thinking, "Oh, my God, how could that happen?"
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And then when the second one hit, it's like oh, my God, somebody's attacking us.  And you just -- it was just so stunning because nobody expected it.
L:  Well, it's out of the blue.
R:  You know, th- there was no heightened security or anything 
L:  No.  No. Well, um --
R:  But, um --
L:  -- I had the radio on, you know, and they came on the, you know, show I was listening to and said well, a plane has hit the World Trade Center and, you know, they weren't too shook up.  You know, I mean, they just thought it -- and you know, to me I thought that it was a little two seater plane or something, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Right.  Some -- some -- some kind of accident.
L:  I didn't realize it was this big airliner and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all those people, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  But, uh --
L:  What's our original question?  Is it [PAUSE] what would -- how would people be affected by a terrorist attack?  Or just us personally?
R:  I think us personally.  Um, you know, as -- as for me, I -- I used to be a reporter, uh, did TV and radio news.  And you -- 
L:  Ooh!
R:  -- you just learn to stay calm in these kinds of situations.  So, I think, you know, my previous job and that kind of training would help me keep calm.  But inside you're still feeling like you're going nuts.  But you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- outwardly remain calm.
L:  Right. 
R:  Um, so, I'm -- I'm guessing that's how I would react but, I mean, who knows?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  How about you?  Well, I know you're -- you're rural and all that but, um, s- -- who knows what can happen?
L:  A- it -- it -- it's just, um, it's hard to imagine and I suppose, you know, it depend where you were and who you were with, you know, if -- if you had any of your loved ones with you or anything, you know, that you'd be concerned about.  Or, um, [PAUSE] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you're fearful for what might happen to you and then they wouldn't know what happened [LAUGH].
R:  Well, you know, I um, I took a trip to New York last summer and it's in the back of your mind; well, you know, it -- it can happen again. You hope it won't, you figure the odds area against it but you just don't know.  I don't know how --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I would react.
L:  Well, some people still are afraid to fly.  You know, they say well, I don't want to go any place. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, I know that the Friday after nine one one, some -- a couple here were to fly to, uh, Germany to visit their -- her -- their daughter and her husband, who work over there, and she called 'em and she said, "Don't come".  Y- -- and they -- her mom was all geared up to go, you know and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- boy she wasn't going to let this keep her home.  And -- and Sarah called and she said, " Now don't you come" she said, "You -- I don't want you to come".  She said. "The military is on high alert and they're just --" 
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- busy over here, you know, and -- and you stay home".  [LAUGH]  So, they waited and -- and went the next spring I think they got to go.
R:  Yeah. 'cause th- the military around here, it was unreal because, um, th- the next day on the twelfth they shut our office down.  Now we're not on base but we're a military office that's off base.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- and the thirteenth they told us to stay home too because we just -- they said there's nothing for you to do, the, you know, they're concentrating on X, Y and Z.  And just stay home.
L:  Right.
R:  So, we -- we didn't go to work.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  And I had been sick that day on nine eleven but, um, just horrible, just horrible.
L:  Oh, sure.  Do you belong to RMC?
R:  I do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm -- I'm Deborah in Chesapeake.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  [inaudible]
L:  So, I'll just ask, you know --
R:  I was wondering --
L:  -- so, I talked to so and so and she belonged to RMC.  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, this is Deborah in Chesapeake and I --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- was -- I was going to look -- I was going to look for Ruth in Missouri on the -- the list. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  W- -- gee, it's nice to talk to you, Ruth. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, this is fun. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we can all thank Janette.  [LAUGH] She --
L:  Right.
R:  -- turned us all on to this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Oh, she's -- she just knows everything.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I think she sits at her computer all day long.  But, um, she's --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- she's been a big help to me.
L:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  I've-- we've only had a computer two years and I just started out cold turkey, I never had any lessons or anything.  And so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I've [inaudible] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I was debating on whether to ask and I'm glad you did.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Do you, uh -- do you write in, you know, post or --
R:  Well, I --I --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] off topic?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I did today because, uh, one of our local grocery stores had, um, a rebate listed in the paper for twenty pounds of charcoal.  And I still use charcoal grill.  Um, and it was for a full rebate.  So, I wrote in and said, you know, anybody in South Eastern Virginia, go to Farm Fresh and get your charcoal and -- so, I --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- so, I -- I submitted one today.
L:  Yeah.  Well, let's see. Oh, I asked one today too about a [MN] the re- Reebok, um, I can't -- you know, they got that instant win scratcher game on the--
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [inaudible] And I couldn't g- -- I couldn't get it to work, I don't know.  And so I --
R:  I don't think I've done that one yet.
L:  Well -- 
R:  But I was going to try t- to do a con[?] agra[?] tonight and hope for the best and [LAUGH] --
