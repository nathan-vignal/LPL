L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Angie from Illinois.
L:  Illinois?  Well, I was born in Illinois, Angie, but I'm Lorraina and I'm currently living in Phoenix, Arizona.
R:  Oh, how nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's pretty nice here right now.  It's getting a little warm but, you know, the weather's pretty good.  I was born in, um, Kanton[?], Illinois, outside of Peoria[?].
R:  Oh, okay, okay.  I think, uh, [NOISE] there's that kinda near -- is it Greenfield near there?
L:  Yeah, it's in that area.
R:  Yeah, I had a couple of college friends from Greenfield.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And where are you?
R:  Um, I'm in Belvedere which is right outside of Rockford.
L:  I know where that is.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I had a friend that lived there a long time ago.  She's gone now but she's in, uh, California now.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, what about this thing?  I guess they're asking us about, like, the O.J. trial --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all these things?
R:  You know --
L:  Do you watch any of that?
R:  You know, I don't really.  I mean, I guess I can't say that I've never looked at it and my feelings are kind of double sided I guess.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I think, um ... I don't know.  I kind of feel bad for the celebrities on one hand because I think just the fact that they're on TV and something like that, I think people just automatically assume they're guilty.
L:  And -- yeah, I think we kinda have this thing in our society a little bit where since they're successful people there's always that little thing about, "Oh, what did they do now?"
R:  Right.
L:  And people just kind of tend to think, "Yep, he did it", um, and I'm thinking about the Robert Blake, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- murder trial and I know I don't watch Court TV a lot but it is one of the stations that we have here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I just thought about it a- you know, as it was happening and unfolding and I thought, he's already guilty in everyone's eyes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- and he may be.
R:  Right.
L:  But the thing is I -- I don't think he's gonna get a fair trial.
R:  No.
L:  And the more that they, um, let the media in and all that sensationalism, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, and it seems like they only want to show the one side of it too.  
L:  Don't they.
R:  You know, they wanna set -- 'cause I don't know.  Did you watch that, um -- it was, uh, on, um -- [LIPSMACK] oh, what was it on?  Barbara Walters ... had him on.
L:  Yes!
R:  And it just -- I -- I mean, maybe that was him but I think it just really portrayed him as kinda losing it.
L:  Didn't it.
R:  You know and maybe he is but, you know, th- that's so easily -- for them to just p- portray that part and him being in jail, he can't really [LAUGH] do anything about it.
L:  He can't and the thing is is that my daughter in high school, she's, um, twenty two now, but sh- when she was a senior in high school a few years back, she was in the TV production class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she would just show me basic things how they edit.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  And she said, "Mom, you know, it made me really look at TV news and everything very differently because I'm aware now of how they can, you know, skew it to look one certain way".
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's very biased.
R:  Yeah, that was my -- actually that was my major in college --
L:  Was it?
R:  -- was television broadcasting so -- 
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  "-- you know, and even though I might feel that maybe he did it, you know, I just know because of what the media can do that ... you know, even if he is innocent or, you know, and people are gonna think, "He's got all that money, he can ... 
L:  Exactly.
R:  "-- he can buy his innocence" you know?
L:  I did watch the O.J. trial because at the time that I did I was, um, a consultant at Art University at ASTU.  Um, my majors are in psychology and, um, so I was doing some consultant work for them and I was doing this thing where I was going in, like, late in the -- in the evenings and sometimes I worked there till like, you know, early morning because I was reviewing tapes they were doing on all the special expression stuff.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, I would come home and that damn thing was on and I needed to unwind so I'd sit there and I'm watch it for, like, an hour and a half, two hours, and fall asleep usually.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And I tell you it was -- it was a very exciting thing and yet even though I thought he was guilty, I also started thinking about what the repercussions are for letting the media in on such a high profile thing like that.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- I'm very -- I mean, it's interesting on the one hand, we all are curious about that stuff but when you take a step back, like you said, you feel sorry for them because if they do have a big name or they are famous, uh, it's almost like they want them to be guilty ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yep.
L:  So, I don't know.  Do you get -- well, Court TV started in Illinois, didn't it?
R:  I think, you know I ... we might get it.  I'm not even sure.  I guess --
L:  Well, my dad lived in, um, Kanton where I was born --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and he passed away in ninety six but when I was there, you know, the year before that, Court TV was already there and we didn't have it in Arizona ...
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, I know that I thought it kind of had its grass roots back there.  Um, [LIPSMACK] but I don't know, I just ... you know I -- I just have mixed feelings like you do, I guess.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think we probably do have it but I just don't, um ... I don't know.  I have two young kids so I g- -- [LAUGH]
L:  So, you don't have time to like it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God, how would you?
R:  Yeah, we watch PBS.  That's it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, mine is I -- my daughter's gonna be twenty three tomorrow, it's her birthday, and my son is thirteen so I have 'em ten years apart.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I have an eight year old and a two year old so --
L:  So, it's a little bit like that, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yours is six years but, you know, when people say, "Ooh, what were you thinking?" and I said, "Well, I wasn't thinking". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, I mean, so really I have more time on my hands and I have caught a few things like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I watch it more on the news.  Like, the news shows like Date Line or --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- or that kind of thing when it comes up.  And the new one that's out right now, of course, is the Peterson -- the Laci Peterson --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I don't know what to think.  I mean, by all accounts he looks guilty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But what made me think more that he was guilty was when he was so close to the Mexican border and he had dyed his hair --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then said, "No, it just happened in the pool".  Now, listen ... [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, yeah. 
L:  -- you know, we --
R:  I just --
L:  -- live out here where there's pool and sun and that doesn't happen in -- just overnight or in a few days, you know?
R:  Mhm.  There're so many things I think for him that just point to guilty.  I can't imagine that he's not.  
L:  Don't you?
R:  But, you know, like you say, there could be -- I don't know.  I -- [LAUGH] there's so many things that are against him that I don't know, and now they're coming up with the cult thing.
L:  Oh, I didn't hear that.
R:  Oh, yeah, they -- the -- the, um, [LIPSMACK] um, his defense team says that there's a cult -- something about some van and there was a cult that was involved with that and they're gonna have it proven within forty eight hours and every- uh, everyone on the prosecution was gonna have egg on their face and so on and so forth and ... 
L:  When did they come out with that?
R:  I think yesterday.
L:  So, they have another twenty four hours?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know.  It sounds kind of shades of, um, what was that other one?  Uh, the green beret -- ex green beret who killed his wife and kids and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he tried to say it was the hippie -- 'cause I think the Manson murders had just occurred and this was back in -- when was that?  The seventies or something like that?  And I've read all about that stuff when I was in college because we had a criminal psych class and, uh, I don't know, it sounds like that.  Like, they're pulling for an excuse.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And his family is saying, you know, you just don't know them and you don't know how happy they were together and we're gonna tell you about all the things they did.  But on the other hand, nobody really knows except for the husband and wife exactly what goes on in their house anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  So, even the family -- I mean, I understand the family's feelings but he looks so darn guilty.
R:  Oh yeah, and isn't -- wasn't there a proven affair too?
L:  Yeah.  And she came forward and I saw just on the nightly news the other night she was there with that real famous Gloria ... [LIPSMACK] Alred[?] I think her name is and she's a very famous attorney.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she had the girlfriend, the ex girlfriend or mistress on -- uh, at a press conference with her and this woman was -- had come forward as soon as she found out Laci had been killed and said, "Oh, my God, you know, and I didn't even know he was married".
R:  Oh!  Can you imagine? [LAUGH]
L:  But she came out right away.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh!
L:  I know, so she is like right now doing press conferences and getting out what she feels because she doesn't want to be associated with that at all, and she knew nothing.
R:  How awful.
L:  I mean, can you imagine how she would feel?
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  I mean, you shouldn't be having [LAUGH] an affair, I guess.  I'm not gonna judge the person --
R:  No.
L:  -- but she had no idea he was married so --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- how can you blame that poor girl?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know?
R:  What a awful thing to have to -- yuck!
L:  Can you imagine?
R:  She'll be creeped [LAUGH] out for quite a while. 
L:  I know and it was just on the nightly news.  It wasn't, um, you know, like, special or anything on, um, even one of the news shows.  It was just on our NBC news, um, when I was watching the other evening.
R:  Oh no. [NOISE]
L:  And I felt bad for her because I thought, if that were me and then to think, well, maybe because he had those feelings for me he did that to --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- his family.  Uh, she can't blame herself like that but you know people will.
R:  Oh, sure, yeah.
L:  You know.  So, I wanted to ask you real quick before they beep us out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, have you heard about, like, how you get paid through this?
R:  You know what?  This is only my second call.
L:  Okay, this is my third.  Do you get three?
R:  I think you get three from one phone and then if you will, like, wanna call, like if you have a cell phone ...
L:  Oh!
R:  -- then I think you can initiate calls from a cell phone and get paid that way too.
L:  Oh!
R:  Um --
L:  I don't even remember how I hooked up with them, honestly.  I -- I think I --
R:  Uh, you don't belong to, uh, anything on line like refund cents dot com, do you?
L:  Oh, I didn't but I think I was looking at, like, mystery shopping places and stuff.
R:  That's probably how.
L:  Because my friend was doing that and maybe that's how I got it, like, a survey place or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- something like that.  Well, cause, uh, the guy that I talked with last time told me, "Well, maybe we'll do good and they'll pick us for the five week study".
R:  Yeah.  Y- --
L:  And I said, "What is that?"
R:  They said it's really important to, like, you know, leave comments in the comments section --
L:  At the end?
R:  -- that you enjoy it.
L:  Oh!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, [LAUGH] I haven't done anything.  See, I didn't do that at all.
R:  Yeah, just to let 'em know.
L:  Last time I heard the beep and then I just said s- something like, okay, I'm leaving my name and number in case you need to reach me.  So, now I'll make a comment.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so --
L:  Well, you know, what's the weather like there?
R:  Um, tod- --
