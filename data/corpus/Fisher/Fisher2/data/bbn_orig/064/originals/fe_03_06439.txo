L:  I'm Lorna Mellion[?].
R:  Hi.  This is Joe.
L:  Hi, Joe.  How ya doing?
R:  Good.
L:  Pretty good?  So, the topic of the day is terrorist?
R:  Terrorism.
L:  Terrorism?
R:  How do we think we would act if there was a terrorist attack.
L:  Yep.  Um, how would they react?  Well, basically, um, now -- now, after it's happened or before you think?
R:  It said after a terrorism attack.
L:  After.  Basically what I think is, um, they're more calm about it now -- now that they're having more, um, emergency evacuations in different places, depending on the buildings, it would be more of a calm setting.  But I don't think in that kinda situation anybody would be calm.  It still would be a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- panic situation like earthquakes.
R:  Yeah.  I think it would kinda depend what kinda -- what it was.  If it was something like the World Trade Center where buildings were blowing up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I think the more -- more visual there would be the more panic they'd be.
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  If it something like, uh, uh, invisible nerve gas or something, you know, it'd probably even be worse --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- because people wouldn't know what to do.
L:  Exactly.  But, um, you know how some places are having those, um -- I don't know about ...
R:  Disaster drills.
L:  Disaster drills.
R:  Right.
L:  There you go.
R:  They've had 'em all over, yeah.
L:  So, I think it's being more -- a little more progressive, you know?  People are more prepared versus -- versus before.  That's what I think.  So ...
R:  Well, I think it's important to have those because --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- uh, you know, it's like -- it's something nobody's ever experience and so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- unless you have some kinda rehearsal, you know, which is unfortunate that we have to have, but that's just the way the world is now.  It's like, you know, something we have to accept, to be ready for.
L:  Yep.  [SIGH] How have you prepared?  H- have you or ...?
R:  Well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, not -- I live in the Pacific, northwest, and there's not a whole lot I can do.  I mean, you know, if -- if -- I've, you know -- I've got, uh, radio and batteries and that kinda stuff in the car and that, but it may not even be safe to leave in the car, you know, they may tell ya you'd be safer off -- better off to stay at home, you know?  Who knows?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I kinda think when, uh, my time's up it's up, you know?  It's like I'm not gonna look for it but, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I'm not gonna -- it's not gonna do much good to hide in the basement I don't think if it's really very devastating.
L:  Yeah, it is.  [LAUGH]  Did, um -- I don't know.  I feel, um -- I -- I wouldn't know how to feel if I was in one of those, you know what I mean?  I've -- in a building or anything like that.  Have you?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  Not at all.  I've been in earthquakes and tornados, I mean, not big ones.  But I've seen them, you know, been in cities were there have been tornados and earthquakes.  But I don't think there's -- there is anything that can, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- match the devastation of the buildings --
L:  Buildings.
R:  -- you know, something like blowing the World Trade Center, you know, that's gotta be --
L:  Even worse.
R:  -- someth- ...  Oh, sure.
L:  Even more tragic.
R:  Just what I -- you know -- and there was an- -- there was probably too much of it on T.V. to suit me, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there was a lot of it and, uh, I could just imagine.  And, you know, I thought it was really neat the way everyone came together.  I mean, there was an outpour of -- of support and -- and volunteers and, uh, from memory Walk of Life and every kind of business and every -- the community really came together --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and I kinda think that really is what makes the United States different from most other countries is we -- we are very --
L:  Stick together.
R:  -- +resilient.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We may fight amongst ourselves or our neighbors, but when push comes to shove, you know, we stand together.
L:  That's true.  [LAUGH]
R:  And, uh ...
L:  Without a doubt.
R:  And, of course, a lot of other countries don't have the resources a lotta people here do, or companies who do, which probably makes a difference.  But it's kinda the way I think most Americans are -- are brought up and most of what they see.  There's -- there's a lot of charity.  America has a big heart.  There are a lot of charities, there's a lot of foundations, a lot of organizations that -- that help for everything -- for every kinda thing.
L:  Exac- ...
R:  So, for -- there's a foundation or charity for anything you can think of and, uh -- and I guess that's good.
L:  That is.  I mean, without, um, support, you know, from different, um, places and different, you know -- each handing out a helping hand when something like that occurs, I mean, we wouldn't be here, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, I was reading -- well, I had -- I had read one article about what happened to this one lady inside the World Trade Center when it collapsed.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She had a hard time just -- I mean, she was inside one of the buildings and she just fell.  But luckily she -- she survived.  One of the officers found her --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- and -- and I was like Jesus.  I mean, she -- she said all the b- -- there was like a bunch of dead bodies around her, but despite the fact -- like, she felt -- it felt comforting versus the rock -- the rock that she felt in between her, like her -- her foot and her, um ...  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  The concrete versus, you know, having some kind of comfort.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, it's some reminder of life.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But even though it's death.  But I think the -- the devastating thing for those people, one of the things would be they didn't know what was going on, a lot of 'em.  I mean, it was like -- they -- they didn't realize that an airplane had hit and then another airplane.  It's -- all they knew is the buildings having -- they knew every place they c- could go could be blowing up, you know?
L:  [MN] Exactly.
R:  They didn't know that if they just left and just ran out on the street -- I mean, they showed 'em running and stuff.  But, I mean, in their mind they still didn't know they were gonna be safe because they didn't know what they were running from, you know?
L:  I mean, who would ever have thought -- I mean, come on, an airplane crashing into a -- a building?  Nobody would've thought that would -- you know what I mean? --
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's ...
L:  -- that would occur.
R:  No.  But we're ...
L:  Now, they ...  [MN]
R:  We j- -- well, now -- now anything's conceivable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they -- they -- we know -- now, isn't it -- it's strange because now to me it's like yeah, it makes sense because they've had suicide bombers for a long time, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like -- it's -- it's -- at the time it was like who would ever believe it?  But then -- now you see -- well, yeah, they have -- they -- they have suicide drivers who drive cars, suicide bombers who do planes, suicide --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- walkers.
L:  Oh, without a doubt.
R:  I mean, and they've had that stuff for a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, for -- again put it on a grand scale.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they did.  I mean, it's, uh -- it -- it caused our whole nation to have a -- we've had a -- a long comfort of not having any war on our soil and no -- nothing on our soil.  We've never allowed it, never -- no terrorists --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no -- nothing, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.
R:  And it's gone on everywhere else in the world, you now, the uprisings here and wars there and bombs going off there and -- but just -- we get involved in it, but always as soldiers leaving, y- you know, our country and go and defending or protecting or doing something, and they come -- our soldiers come home.  We -- we haven't fought any battles on our soil in our lifetimes.  I mean ...
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I was going to ask you, how did you feel -- you know -- I -- as far as I felt, you know, about the war I felt -- did you feel -- were you supportive, do you think of it -- but then I -- I saw from other peop- -- you know, some of the other people on the streets, "Stop the war.  Peace.  Peace" you know?  You saw those demonstrators, right?
R:  Well, yeah.  And, you know, I'm -- I'm old enough.  I've -- I've lived through the same thing.  I -- I was, uh, a flower child in the sixties.  So, I went through this with the Vietnam War, the exact same thing, except I think it was worse in the -- during the Vietnam War because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for a couple of reasons, one, there were more guys enlisting then, there was, you know -- and then you had another group of guys that were going off to Canada to avoid the war --
L:  Jesus!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh ...
L:  I could imagine.
R:  Yeah.  And then you had, uh, a group of people against -- ev- everybody, you know -- the majority of the people thought that the war against Vietnam was wrong.  But they -- they didn't show the support I don't think they should've for the soldiers, you know?
L:  Well, I have also seen another article, uh, about the Vietnam War.  I mean, some -- even after the war happened and there was a lot of -- you know how there -- there was a lot of veterans that were having problems physically?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, they were -- there were some ...
R:  Agent Orange and stuff, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's very real and, of course, the -- the government's never going to confess to it or admit to it 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'd have to, you know, be held liable or responsible for something, and they're above anybody telling them anything.
L:  Well ...
R:  I think that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's very real because they've proven it over and over.  It's like they've done it in studies for people who, you know -- it wasn't until after they did the study that they even knew who had been to Vietnam or not and they all had identical symptoms and ...
L:  Well, one -- one guy -- the one I was reading the article about -- he had stated something about trying to sue, uh, I think it was a Jap- um -- I -- I wasn't sure -- but a Vietnamese company or something that was going on.  I'm -- I'm not sure which company it was, but some of the companies that were involved back in the war, you know what I mean?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that -- or in the United States -- and some -- you know, some of the -- the Superior Court even had ruled against him overall basically 'cause -- I mean, th- they wouldn't support -- basically we're, you know, supporting the war and we -- we decided to fight for our country, but then when he decided to come back he -- what he was trying to say is that they weren't supporting him with the lawsuits he was trying to put against, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the different several companies and basically the courts weren't approving.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I kinda agree with the court I think on that, and generally I'd -- a lotta times I don't.  But, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, in a -- in a time of -- of something like Vietnam -- and they never d- --
