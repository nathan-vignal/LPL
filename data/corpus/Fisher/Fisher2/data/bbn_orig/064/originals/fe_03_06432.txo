L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Kerry.
L:   Where are you from?
R:  Um, I'm from Arkansas.
L:  Oh, my name is Lily, and I'm from New Jersey.
R:  Oh, look, I spoke to someone else on here from New -- New Jersey.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] That's so funny.  But, um when did she say -- she said, um, terrorism if we think that people would remain calm or if they panic.
L:  Right.
R:  And what we would do?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Well, um, goodness.  I bet you have a lot to say about this being close to New York.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, yeah.  We saw it.  It was, you know, it really affected us.  My father was in it.
R:  Oh, no.  It -- was he okay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah, he got out.
R:  Well, that's really good.
L:  But, um, I don't know, I think you're in too much shock at first --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to panic.  Like, you're just -- at least w- what happened with nine eleven, it was total disbelief.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, [PAUSE] but, you know, that was very isolated kind of terrorist attack because it was the city.  Believe it was something, you know, like, biological --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that got out, I'd think there would be a total panic.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Most definitely.
L:  Like, do you watch that TV show Twenty Four?
R:  Uh-uh.  I've never seen it.
L:  Oh, it's a really good show.  [MN] It's on here every Tuesday night with Kiefer Sutherland --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and it's very, very realistic about, like, you know, terrorists trying to explode a nuclear device in the United States.  And +actually -- actually successful at it.  And, um, they showed what happened on -- on that show and the country went into a panic.
R:  Oh, wow!  It sounds like an interesting show.
L:  It's really cool.
R:  But, um, you know, I kind of -- I agree with you, I think that [SIGH] well, I mean, like, as far as [SIGH] panicking or not, you know, I think it -- it'd be really shocking, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I agree with you.  And I think that if it were something more, [LIPSMACK] you know, biological and, you know, a bigger area, like nationwide or worldwide --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think it -- you know, people would definitely panic a lot more and, you know, like, 'cause ya, you know, like, really, I mean, you've seen, like, certain effects of -- of like the terrorism and where people, you know, would go out and, like, get, like, um, gas mask and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, different things like that where they would panic a little so, that, um ... And my dad, he panics a little.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you have, like, ah, one of those little safe rooms?
R:  No.  No, no, no.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I mean, you know, he's, like, oh, he's, like he, "You don't know what's going to happen, you better stock up on food".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.
L:  Well, when I started working in the city again, um, I was heading in and, you know, we're always at a high alert over here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my father hands me two bottles of water and coffee filters.  And I looked at him and I'm like, "What am I supposed to do with this?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And he was like, "In case they release something you can breath -- put the water in the coffee filter and put it over your nose and your mouth and you can breath through it".
R:  Oh, really?
L:  For a little while, I mean, like, you know, it's just -- I guess just you have to be -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you feel like you have to do something.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, he felt, like, okay 'cause my -- my dad retired after that --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I guess he was just, like, "All right" you know, "I just have to do something" 'cause you can't -- you know, his thing is you can't stop living.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have to keep doing what you're doing.  But, like, it's very scary.  I was saying to my girlfriend just today I'm, like, "Do you even remember what it was like to have that total sense of security before it happened?"  [PAUSE] Like, I can't even remember --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what it was like before it all happened.
R:  [MN] So, you're, um, you're dad was, like, actually there when it happened?
L:  Yeah, he was a block away on Wall Street.
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  And, um --
R:  I bet that, like, really -- I mean, did you hear about it before you found out if he was okay and everything?
L:  Well -- well, it was funny be- because, um, I was pregnant at the time; I was due the following month.  And, ah, my girlfriend lived -- lives in New Jersey but lives right on the water, like, the -- the skyline was in her living room.  And she called me and she's, like, "Something's wrong with my cable" she goes "but I'm looking out my window and the Trade Center's on fire".
R:  Oh!
L:  She says, "Turn on your TV".  So, I turned it on and she's listening to the radio and that's when they were still saying that they thought it was a small plane, like, they didn't know what happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she started screaming and I'm trying to find out what she's screaming about and then I see the plane on the TV.  Like, we were watching -- I was watching it live and she was watching it; it was right in front of her.
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  And we both saw the next plane go into the building [LIPSMACK] and we were both, like, freaking out.  I c- -- you know, we got off the phone.  Her husband was in the city; I knew my dad was there.  You know, my husband works in New York and -- called him told him to come home before the bridges closed.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it w- -- it was just, it was really bizarre.  You know, my sister works in Jersey City; she saw the whole thing. Um, thank God, we don't know anyone that was lost but this girl that I'm telling you about, she went to fifteen wakes.
R:  Oh!
L:  For fifteen memorial services.
R:  Oh, that's terrible!
L:  And, um, you know, and then -- and then it jus- it just changes your -- it just changed your whole life.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know even everything around here, like, everything is so fast paced but, like, everything had a -- everything slowed down because the bridges and the tunnels, like, it takes twice as long to get anywhere because, you know, it's better that they check --
R:  Yes.
L:  But, you know, it's -- it's really very -- quite different than it used to be.  To get into any kin- -- like my daughter does modeling --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and to get into any kind of building you have to show ID now.  Like, before you could walk in and out but now you gotta show ID everywhere you go.  And you just second guess everything.   Like, you see something suspicious, where before you would let it pass, and now you're, like, okay, should I call the cops?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Should I report that?  What if I don't report that, what'll happen?
R:  Yeah.  Goodness.
L:  How did it affect you?
R:  Well, I don't think so much, you know, like, here and everything 'cause it wasn't, like, right in front of us.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, and -- and things are -- things are a lot different here [LAUGH] you know.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, like, people [PAUSE] you know, definitely, uh, I guess, kind of, like, are odd after.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people were a lot different but I think things are kind of -- they're not -- they're pretty much kinda going to go back to the way they were.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, people aren't so worried about it and everything.
L:  You see here I don't think it'll ever be back to the way it was.
R:  Yeah.  I don't think so either.
L:  Like, even right now we have fleet week going on.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's when, like, ships from, you know, all different naval ships come in and they're all docked in New York harbor.
R:  Yes.
L:  And so now we're on, like, super high terror alert because all these naval shops are in.  And, um, it's -- it's just real different.  Like, we used to go out on the water every fourth of July; my girlfriend has a boat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we used to sit in the harbor right underneath the twin towers to watch the fireworks and everything. And it's funny I still had, uh, at the time we still had pictures on my camera from that fourth of July.  And then we got them developed and it was so weird because you take them for granted, it's like, "Oh, there they are --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- right behind us" and now they're not there.  And I go into the city and I, you know, I've seen ground zero and there's just this big hole in the ground.  [MN] It's really bizarre.  And it's so weird to look at this because wel- -- I live in New Jersey; I'm about fifty miles away but I live in a mount- -- in the mountains.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You would never believe there was a place like this in New Jersey.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  I -- I never would have thought that. [LAUGH]
L:  I live on a lake in the mountains.  There's deers and there's bears up here --
R:  No way!  Are you serious?
L:  Yeah.  There really is.
R:  You ha- -- oh, you have deer?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's true.  Deer and possum and all that other [LAUGH] good stuff.
R:  Possum!  You have possum?  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  Yeah, I know what possum pie is.
R:  Hey, we -- we don't eat 'em down here.
L:  Well, you know what? --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I heard different.  My -- I have relatives that lives in Missouri and I think they eat them there.
R:  Oh, really.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Hey, there might be some people here but I -- I would not eat a possum.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Potted possum.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But oh, oh, it was so funny, me and a friend of mine, we used to, um, I had this, um, book and it had, like -- 'cause at one time I was thinking about coming to New York.  This is a long time ago, goodness --
L:  Have you ever been here?
R:  No, never.  I've wanted to come. But it was probably, like, seven years ago; I mean this was a long time ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:   We ha- -- I had this tourism book and it had all of these, like, you know, the different eight hundred for the hotels.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we would call and we'd prank call 'em and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  She would -- she would be, like, Betty Sue and I'd be, like, I can't remember -- it was a real countrified names.  And we'd call them and we'd mess with them and [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  -- and make up stuff like that and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and they were thinking, " [inaudible] these people are -- these people are crazy -- crazy hillbillies".
L:  Well, anyone who's not from the immediate area is different --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- according to us.  But yeah, so, like, we do have nice areas in New Jersey and in, you know, New ne- -- in New York State, but where I live, the r-  -- the road -- the main road that comes through here is called the Skyline Drive.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's Skyline Drive because even from here you were able to see the top of the twin towers.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  And, you know, now and --
R:  It sounds beautiful
L:  -- now you can't see 'em anymore -- anymore and -- 'cause they're not there.  And the whole skyline looks different, like, even now, like, you know, if we're driving around and you look at the skyline --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my husband always says, "What city is that?  Is that Pittsburgh?"  Like, it's so undefined; you can't tell what it is anymore.
R:  Wow!
L:  I mean, now you see the Empire State Building but the whole tip of the island where yo- you always knew where you were just by looking up to see the towers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it, you know, and it's gone.  And it's still hard to believe that it's gone.
R:  Yeah.  It's terrible what happens to others, innocent people.
L:  I mean, with the people jumping out of the buildings --
R:  I know.  I mean, I could- -- I couldn't imagine 
L:  -- and, uh, my -- my cousin's wife was in the building.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  And she was, um, in the second building and she had been -- the first time the World Trade Center got attacked --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- do you remember that?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, she was in the buildings then.
R:  Oh, my goodness! 
L:  So, when the planes went --
