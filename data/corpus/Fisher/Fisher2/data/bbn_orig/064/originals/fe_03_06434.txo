R:  Hi, I'm Suzy.
L:  Hi, I'm Chris.
R:  [NOISE] Okay, um, I guess we'll start talking about terrorism.  Where do you live? 
L:  Uh, in New York.
R:  Oh, so you're real concerned about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] And where're you from?
R:  Um, St. Lois. 
L:  Uh, oh, oh, lucky.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Concerning that lucky.
R:  Well, they say --
L:  I think --
R:  -- they say that the Arch might be a target but we live pretty far from the Arch.
L:  Oh.  Oh, good, I'm glad that you do that. [LAUGH]
R:  Sorry --
L:  I think -- hm?
R:  Are you panic -- do you think you would panic ...?
L:  I --
R:  -- if there was a terrorist attack?
L:  I -- I don't ...
R:  Depending upon what type?
L:  Well, I think it's -- it de- -- I think it depends on when it happens actually for me because I have, um, three young children.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  And right now they're spread out at all different schools and that --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- some of 'em are kind of far from each other so that could cause some panic [LAUGH] in me definitely 'cause it's about, you know, who do I get to first and how do I get them and ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and all that and I have one that's, uh, she's in first grade and I can work out an emergency plan with her.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  But my other two are two and three years old.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  So -- so that's a big concern, especially the two year old, she has no clue.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  So, do you have children?
R:  Yeah, but they're all older.  They're ... twenty four, twenty two and twenty. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow and do they live there too or ...?
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  In fact they all live at home right now until ...
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they -- one finished college ... a semester early and then one finished last ... May so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And one's still in school but he's living here until September so ...
L:  Oh, oh, so at least you have them there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But do you think you would panic?
R:  Um, it -- depending upon what type of ... attack it was.  Like if they found anthrax [NOISE] ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- I don't think I would be as panicked --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] as if they found ... a dirty bomb.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Or, um ... you know or if they tainted the water supply, um ...
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] -- I would be panicked.  I mean ... to be perfect honest, I've, um, [NOISE] you know, purchased some bottled water --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- and soft drinks and some things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And have 'em in ... our lower levels.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] So that in case something happens, you know, at least we have ... some +sustenance -- sustenance. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I've done the same thing [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  But you know, I didn't even think about the anthrax.  You know, to me all I think about when I hear that is nine eleven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it was just so close to home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I was very lucky where I didn't lose anybody there.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And I keep thinking, "Well, I got lucky that time". [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] And about the next, you know?
R:  [NOISE] I know.
L:  And they were -- you know, there were several people who could have been in -- I know my brother worked on Chambers St right near there.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  But his, uh -- it happened as his bus was going in and they stopped.  They never went in.
R:  [COUGH] Oh, that's good. [NOISE]
L:  He lives in Jersey and, um, my younger brother lives in -- uh, well, he used to live in Manhattan when that happened.  Now he lives on Long Island.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But you know he still lives there but he was far enough away where it was fine.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And then, uh, my boyfriend was actually going to be delivering magazines in Manhattan.  He was coming into Jersey but they blocked off everything again, uh, before it happened --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- so we really lucked out but ... you know, for adults, I guess it's different.  You know, if you're thinking about them, but ... the kids, if that ever happened, I don't -- I kept thinking about it.  I could have been on a trip with the kids in there.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And then what do I do?  Pick up all three and run? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But with the anthrax thing it's -- it's just, uh, it's different. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  I didn't even think about it being -- I guess I consider that a little lower level.  It's not great.  [LAUGH] But --
R:  Right, but ... you know, you can take stepro[?].
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And it's a little less caustic. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Um ... uh, I'm really -- like I wouldn't go to the Indianapolis five hundred this year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If we had tickets.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  We don't, but I mean, if we did [NOISE] I wouldn't consider that because as of this point, since they ra- raised the ... the threat [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Because, you know, that's a huge venue.
L:  Mhm mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But I don't think I would panic too much.  I -- I think fifty percent of the population would really panic.
L:  Right.  Right, I -- yeah, I think a lot of people ... I think a lot of people pretty much already have been.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  If you watch even just -- even just the water sales and the duct tape sales --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- I've been watching the supermarkets profit from the water sales [LAUGH] because they're [inaudible] --
R:  [NOISE] I can imagine.
L:  I -- yeah, they raised it.  Uh, I can't believe like, three dollars for a six pack where, you know, we used to be able to get it for a -- you know, two dollars or something.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And -- and just all that happening, and the duct tape being taken off all the shelves, oh my God! [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Now, see, we didn't have that much of a mass ... purchasing here in St. Lois.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] You know, like, our water ... I know, I just bought a twenty four pack of ... um, I can't think of the name of it.  It's one I always buy.  Anyway ...
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Um, it's not a store brand or anything.  I mean, it's a -- you know, name brand.  They buy Coke or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And it was like only ... four ninety.
L:  [COUGH] Wow. [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] For a twenty four pack so ...
L:  Wow, you guys really haven't seen [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we really haven't.  Um, I worry about the food supply.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Coming in from other countries.
L:  Oh yeah.  Already I worry about that, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And that would kinda panic me.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] A little bit.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] You know, since I ... you know, they -- they've talked about which isn't really terrorist but, I mean, you think about how people are reacting to the mad cow the -- they found in, um, Canada.  I mean, uh, the TV journalists and stuff are talking about that and getting people kinda riled up.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [NOISE] And [SIGH] you know, that's ... pretty minor.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Compared to, you know, a big terrorist --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- attack.
L:  Right.  Well, they say that ... they're getting ready to do it again.
R:  [NOISE] I know.
L:  On whatever transmissions and stuff.  I can't even imagine what -- what they're gonna do this time.  And I guess that's the idea and all, but you know, will it be something lower level or will it be ... you know on nine eleven scale.  I know they're advertising that but I -- I know -- you don't even know what to do with the media.  I think the media panics so many people just by saying stuff like that.  Not even being sure.
R:  Right.
L:  Or it could be this, or it could be that.  Nobody knows what to think, of course they panic.
R:  Right.  I think, you know, that we should be kept informed that there are possibilities and that, you know, I mean, from what I've heard, you know, that it would probably be ... you know, a venue --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or ... you know, something like that or an army base or ... you know, something like that so ... I don't know.  It -- it -- it doesn't really bother me that much.  I'm, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm not gonna stop flying.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... [COUGH]
L:  Yeah, we -- well, I think it's unlikely they're gonna go that way again [LAUGH] so --
R:  Well, no they were talking about it.
L:  Really?  I didn't hear that.
R:  Yeah, they were talking about, you know, that somebody might rent a private plane or ...
L:  God.
R:  -- you know, something like that.
L:  And it's just so easy.  That's the [LAUGH] scariest thing, it's just so e- --
R:  Well ... yeah.  And, you know, I would -- I would pa- -- I would panic until I knew everybody was -- that all my kids were okay.
L:  Right.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how old they are, they're still [LAUGH] your kids.
R:  Yeah, they are.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, well, boy -- with them being older, it's not necessarily a better thing either because they could be off wherever too just as well as my kids are in different schools.
R:  Oh, yeah.  They c- -- you know --
L:  At least I know where they are too.
R:  Right.
L:  You've [LAUGH] --
R:  And I never do, I mean, unless ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I have the cell phone and they're calling me on the cell phone.  That's the only way ... [LIPSMACK] you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I get all of 'em unless they're home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um ... I -- I think, you know, I think the media has -- has gotten people panicked already.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Right now.
L:  Right.
R:  Because of raising the terrorist threat.  They just kinda ... over emphasized it I think.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I think everybody should take precautions ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think we should all the time, you know, like if we're flying.  If there're bags there that ... [LIPSMACK] you know, are unattended, go tell somebody [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But, um ... in fact it's funny 'cause I always take a Coke on the plane with me.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  And you can't do that now.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Well, they make you drink it; drink some of it.
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.  It's great that they do that but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's so funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's -- that's good.  They [NOISE] keep talking too about how people are getting insulted about being detained because of their heritage and things like that.  You know, if -- if there's nothing -- if you people aren't up to anything, you should be so glad that you are here and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people are doing that.  They're keeping you safe as well as the rest of us [LAUGH] no matter --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what the heritage.
R:  I -- my daughter was just telling me about ... a guy from Turkey, [NOISE] but his parents ... they've lived here a long, long time.  His father's a physician [NOISE] ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- and he graduated about a year and a half ago and he grade in computer engineering and he got a great job in computer engineering but because it was so -- such a sensitive area ... he couldn't -- they had to decline him after -- after he had already been accepted.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  For the job because of --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- the security.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, that is just -- that's too bad.
R:  And it's because he's from Turkey.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um --
