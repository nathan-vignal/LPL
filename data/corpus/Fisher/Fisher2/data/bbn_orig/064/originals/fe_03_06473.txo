L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Kelly.
R:  I'm Janet.
L:  Hi, Janet.
R:  Oh, I'm --
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Virginia.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, we're neighbors then, sort of.  I'm in South Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, criminal trials?  [LAUGH] Uh, what are your opinions?
R:  Well, I don't particularly like the thought of them being ... televised.  I think we have enough ... 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- sensational, uh -- 
L:  Just turn on the news. [LAUGH]
R:  -- many things are made in sensational as they are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, but I can understand that people -- you know, some people -- these reality shows are really big so I can understand that people can get off on a high profile trial.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My -- my personal feeling is there should be close -- kept this a room that people who have an inter- -- you know, a real interest, meaning like they're related or something, can -- can -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- can see it but not general public on -- on the major channels.
L:  Right.  Well, I -- I -- I agree.  I mean, people should be allowed to attend and all but ... you know, the ones, like that O.J. trial.  I -- I never watched any of it but, uh, I mean, it just -- it went on and on and, you know, nobody really remembered why you're having the trial.  [LAUGH] You know, for the -- the people -- the victims involved and their families.
R:  Right.
L:  It just seems to --
R:  Well, I mean, also a lot of people ... well, pr- with- without trial was that a lot of the people thought he was still guilty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then he sort of makes [LAUGH] our criminal justice system look a little bad if --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- after, you know, [LAUGH] everyone -- that half the people think he -- he got off and he shouldn't have.  But --
L:  Well, yeah, I mean, I -- I agree.  I ... I don't know if he was really there but I think he had something to do with it but, um ... I think when they ... um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- brought out, you know, the -- the glove and that kind of stuff.  I mean, it just sort of -- it -- it all fell downhill but I think he had something to do with it.
R:  Well, I mean, I -- we -- we suspect but ... I don't know.  Really isn't ... I mean, I guess it is sort of our business but it really -- I mean, for us to be gawking at it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it isn't really ... I don't know.  I mean, obviously like the sniper trials.  I mean, we're all -- I'm interested in knowing what the final court decision's gonna be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't think I really need to see all the -- you know, and hear all this -- especially if it turns out he gets off no a technicality.  
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  I'd be fur- [LAUGH] -- that would infuriate me.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I mean, all I need to do is watch it step by step and then, you know, and ... I -- I just -- I think there's -- I mean, with these real life police vide- videos they have on TV and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that's too much.  And then pe- kids are having a hard time drawing a line between what's reality and ...
L:  Yeah, there -- there's been a lot of r- reality shows.  I mean, there's ... [LAUGH] I don't know, I don't -- I don't really get into 'em but ...
R:  Well, I don't but I mean, my son watches them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sometimes so -- I overlook and I go, "Yuck!" and I go, "I guess the same people watch the cops -- real life cops capture people and stuff like that" all probably want to hang on the trial.  Or, I don't know, I guess it can get pretty boring too.
L:  Well, I've -- I've watched, you know, like Cops or something like that but, um, you know, whatever.  It's ... I think it's sort of funny h- you know, the excuses [LAUGH] people give, you know, when they're falling down drunk and, uh, can't walk and [inaudible].  It's, like, yeah, okay.  But ... I -- overall, I just don't think [LAUGH] there's a lot of good things on TV so ... [LAUGH] you just lower your standards a little. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, I don't, uh ... I guess the closest thing I watch is -- I used to watch Survivor sometimes but I mean, those people chose ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to put themselves in the public eye.  It's a little different.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I guess you could say that when he's on trial chose but ... 
L:  Well, i- --
R:  -- but not -- not in that sense.
L:  Assuming that ninety nine percent of them are guilty then they [LAUGH] chose.
R:  Right, if they're guilty.
L:  You know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, but what about if somebody's innocent?
L:  Well --
R:  Then you're having your whole life splashed out there in --
L:  Oh, I -- I know.  [MN] Um, I mean, I'm -- I'm pretty much, like, for the -- the death penalty but there's always the chance that you get somebody that really and truly is innocent and, you know, that bothers me.
R:  You know, well I've -- I've been reading about quite a few cases where people on death row have been let off because, like, now that they have DNA tests --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they found that they were really innocent and that's kinda spooky.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you think if they could put these people on trial ... in front of everybody, you know, and high profile cases on TV and -- and -- and then everybody knows who they are and then it turns out they're innocent then everyone will -- people will recognize them and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I mean ...
L:  And there's always, uh, going to be somebody that, you know, if -- if a person got let go, you know, there's always going to be somebody that just knows that that person is guilty and you know, might try and do something themselves.  So, that -- you know, that is a disadvantage with it being on TV, you know, everybody sees your face. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  No, I mean, I like watching shows like CSI which are the --
L:  Yes.
R:  But that's ... those are shows and ...
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- not real people.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's one of my, um, favorite shows, you know, CSI or, um, Forensics, you know, that type of thing I -- I find fascinating and, you know, that -- more and more is being used in the -- the trials too.
R:  Yeah, but now you learn all the shows how often they dismiss that key piece of evidence they can't get what they need.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they sometimes know they're guilty and they can't convict them or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or they can't ...y- well ... but, um, ev- --
L:  Well, I just wondered does it ever -- I mean, is somebody really thinking, "Okay, so I'm -- I need to do this but I can't do that because I might leave a trace" y- [LAUGH] I -- I've wondered about that, you know?  Is there -- are there criminals that are actually learning from watching, um, like, trials and forensic stuff so that they know how to escape it? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean, everyone who's smart wears gloves.  
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, that's something they've always -- because of fingerprints but some of these other things ... I don't know.  I mean, if ... It's possible.  But the one thing they could take out from a trial is there's all these little technicalities if you don't say the right things at the right time they can get off.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wonder if they could ever ... try to get themselves in the situation where they can get off because of something like that.
L:  Well, it's very possible.  I mean, when you watch the trials, you know, here you are trying somebody for murder and all of a sudden you've got some little technical, you know, illegal search or something that could spoil the whole case, you know, irregardless of how serious a crime this person possibly committed.
R:  And then also all the proof you have knowing that they're guilty.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, normally they don't, um -- if they get thrown out on a technicality they don't go back because first of all they've already presented their case so the defense can really plan to work against it and ... you know, h- he can almost guarantee.  It's like, yeah, well, okay, we'll just hurry and get this one through.  Um, I don't know.
R:  So, um, I don't think there really have been -- I don't remember anything much in the way of publicized trials besides the O.J. trial.  I mean, the --
L:  Well, I -- I think really that was ... the first one but, you know, really ... really big one.  Um ... of course I [LAUGH] ... I -- 
R:  The -- well, the --
L:  -- I like to watch Judge Judy but that one doesn't count.  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Well, they -- I mean, they have -- I mean, I don't know whether the sniper trial -- I mean, I see it in the paper about it but I don't know whether they're planning to put any of it on --
L:  Well, I was surprised you said that because I did not hear anything about it being put on ... TV.
R:  Well, not on TV but I mean -- we have it -- you know, it happened here.  In fact, one of them was like a few miles from my house --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- where someone got killed so, um, I mean, we have it in our local paper --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, updates on --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- what's going on with at least the first suspect; the kid and how he's trying to insist he didn't have his rights read at the right time or something like that and he's trying to get off that way.  Um [SIGH] sort of infuriating but -- um, but not -- uh, no, not on TV.
L:  Okay, well, uh, you know, I -- I hadn't heard anything but ... if it happened very close to home then yeah, I -- I guess it would be talked about a little bit more.
R:  Well, you know -- you know about what -- what I'm talking about with the sniper, right?
L:  Oh -- oh, yeah.  Oh yeah.
R:  No, I mean, I don't know -- I mean, it was here so I mean I don't know how much people ...
L:  Oh, I -- I think that one pretty much was a national thing you know?  Every- everybody knew about it.  Um ...  [MN] I mean, o- I was up in New York at the time but, I mean, it -- it's scary.  You know?
R:  Yep.  Yeah, it was -- it was --
L:  Especially if it just happened so close to you.  I mean, my god.
R:  Yeah, but we were kinda watching it happen around.  And then, um, you know, they had the kid at the school and then they had th- this -- the person right down the str- -- well, it was about two miles from my house.  And then my -- my -- then my -- my -- the kids started freaking out because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it was so close and, um, they had a -- we all had to like drive our kids to school because they were ... scared and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it took a while before they got un- -- they got to feeling not so [LAUGH] scared anymore.  The kids couldn't go out to recess for weeks and --
L:  Oh, I -- I can imagine.
R:  So ... and I mean, I'm sure we're all interested in ... I mean, here we are complacent knowing that they have other -- you know, they know they're guilty and then ... what -- what do we know of wh- -- what comes out when they're gum- -- they -- they -- they say that their admission wasn't -- wasn't -- you can't admit their --
