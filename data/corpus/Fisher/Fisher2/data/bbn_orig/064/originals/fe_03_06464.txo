R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  It's Martha.
R:  Hi, I'm Jean.
L:  Hi.  They didn't hear a tone. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- my -- m- so- -- my son's in the bathtub.  Just get him out and so I didn't -- I was just checking [LAUGH] to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- make sure he's not flooding it.
L:  [LAUGH] Um [LIPSMACK], uh, topic --
R:  They wan- -- [inaudible] --
L:  Our topic today with, uh, the court trials?
R:  I -- I don't have a problem with them being televised myself.  I think that you could shut them off if you didn't wanna watch them.
L:  Eg- yeah, that's -- that's very [LAUGH] true.  Y- yeah.
R:  I have, um -- we just had a big -- not a -- it's not really a high profile but we have -- we just had an event happen really in my town local to me and it's been all over the news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... I think that, um -- I think the media can exploit anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ... um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't -- I don't know.  I have a son -- I don't have a problem with it being -- I think everybody watched the O.J. one.  That was -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was like, you know --
L:  As I say, that's about the only one that I can remember.  High profile that I've seen.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And that wasn't, like ...
R:  That everybody was glued to that we've seen the whole thing.
L:  Yeah, and even so, it's like it gets repetitive or you just get sick of it after a while.  Of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause, you know, you can listen to the regular news and get the update on it.  You don't necessarily have to sit and watch the whole ... case.  Um, that's the only one that I recall that I've ... I've seen before besides, like, uh, the Menendez brothers I think they were?
R:  Oh, yeah, I've seen -- I did see some of that show.
L:  That -- like part of that one and --
R:  I think like you said though, I think I caught more of like the news clips --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- and they tell you the important ...
L:  Yep, um ... there's been some others but not necessarily had profile, like, we have ... the court station, Court TV, and I've watched some older trials and such 'cause I'm -- I like mysteries, like, mystery movies and novels and such.
R:  Ye- I love them on TV.
L:  And so I've seen some just out of ... interest that have been like older shows and such so I don't know if they were high profile or not 'cause, you know, I'm ... only in my early twenties [LAUGH] so I don't know back in their day if they were big or not.
R:  Yeah --
L:  But, uh --
R:  -- I -- I guess everybody has like ho- high profi- -- high profor- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- pro- high pr- profile for me right now is ... [MN] what's going on in my town.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  'Cause I -- I'm -- I'm from the east coast.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm in New Jersey and ... we just had -- the arrest three teenagers that went into a local zoo of ours and killed some animals.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so it's like all over the news down here.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that would be ... pretty big.
R:  So, it's weird, yeah.  I kinda feel like -- well, that to me that's high pr- -- or like the Lacey Peterson case.  I think I'll probably --
L:  Yeah, I would of say I was keeping up with that but I haven't heard if that's gone into --
R:  I don't think he's gone into trial yet.
L:  -- trial yet.  I think that they're just picking the jury.  So, um, yeah, I mean that one would be something of interest considering I gave birth to my baby about the same time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she was due.
R:  [NOISE] Sh.
L:  So, um ... but still even to -- if when that does go to trial I don't necessarily think that I'd be watching it besides just tuning in every once in a while to see --
R:  [MN] Yeah to find out what happens.
L:  -- what's going out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly, or just getting it from the news.  But I think it'd be good for people maybe that are going to school on criminal justice but wanna be something in the legal field with lawyers or judges or whatnot.  Just a ... you know, touch base to keep up on what's going on and also how the whole processing works with ... that.
R:  Yeah, and the legal aspects; the differences, I guess, between also being like the prosecutor.  You get to see all the sides.
L:  Right.
R:  Which part of the law you wanna go into.
L:  Yeah, I think that would be interesting.  But, I mean, besides that it's -- I mean, it's interesting in some cases.  In other cases it's ... not necessarily something you'd want to have sitting on TV when your kids are round the dinner table or something, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Just depends on the ... the case and the ... the aspects of it.
R:  No more water.  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would never would mind with first bor- -- I'm in my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm thirty one.  I have two, uh, a to- -- a four year old and a two year old so ... it's like, wow!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible].
L:  You know, I lucked out, she happened to be sleeping during this phone call.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow!  If, uh -- I'm used to doing seven different things at once.  He's pretty -- pretty well occupied but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he, uh, has a tendency to want the, you know, I -- th- all of a sudden I'll be sitting here and they're watching the water [LAUGH] come out of my bathroom.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like ... [SIGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, it's funny.  Right now on my TV is some court ...
L:  Is it a court case?
R:  Ye- yes, some court.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Court [inaudible], that's funny.
L:  Yeah, I send myself, um -- just 'cause I stay at home there's like nothing really on TV throughout the day that I watch the low profile court cases like, you know, Judge Mathis and ...
R:  Oh, I love those.  Yes, Judge Judy.
L:  Those take -- yeah.  You know, they're kinda funny but I watch those quite a bit 'cause [inaudible] he goes a l- lot of drama to it and ... it's not a reminder of, you know, all the bad things that do happen in real life out there in the real world.  So, I think that's another ... downer aspect of the high profile cases and whatnot.  If you watch that and you just think of how evil society can be it's --
R:  I- it's hard, especially when you have children.  I think it changes the way --
L:  Yeah, like the --
R:  -- you see things.
L:  -- Lacey Peterson case, you know?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know --
R:  How could he do that, you know?  
L:  You know, his -- his wife --
R:  -- change his --
L:  -- and she's pregnant, you know, and the whole issue, did he, you know, kill one person or two people?  I think there's just kind of -- it's very morbid to think about and especially myself being a new mom.  That is just ... I can't imagine anybody doing that to ... any pregnant woman, let alone their pregnant wife.
R:  I had a similar case out here when I had my first, uh, son.  Um, it was the prom baby.  She went to the prom; she delivered her baby in the toilet and --
L:  [MN] I remember hearing about that.  That was in the national news.
R:  Yes, and she is in my town.  We live in the same town.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  So that was, uh ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- definitely followed up on that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I definitely wanted to see --
L:  Now, I don't recall what had happened afterwards ...
R:  She -- she served four years.
L:  -- but I do remember the whole -- the instance had made national --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- media but I don't recall anything, like, sentencing or anything to do with court.
R:  She -- she -- she served her four years.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  She did four years in jail and she's out now trying to live a normal life.
L:  Trying to?
R:  Trying to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think her parents say every once and a while they're still hounded.  You know, the media still comes around but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think that ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people will always gonna wanna know what happens to people that make these -- these cases.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  And I think just ... besides getting a slap on the wrist or serving time or whatnot [NOISE] --
R:  And -- and that's kind of -- that's where I -- that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how I feel today, like, with these kids that killed -- it's been on the national news.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They killed, uh, eight exotic wildlife birds.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they're really going to, uh, use these child- -- these kids.  'Cause they're eighteen and I call 'em kids 'cause they're really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  He's eighteen or kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, as examples over here but we had a similar case ... with a really big dog fighting ring that they just ... [SIGH] you know, this is like my local news.  It was a big dog fighting ring that they broke up and I feel like they -- you know, it was a slap on the wrist for the people who were arrested related to that event.  And there was fifty people involved.
L:  Huh. [NOISE]
R:  And I think that if they were going to try and make ... examples of people, they should of done it with the adults who knew better than these kids, but ...
L:  Right.
R:  But  ... were just kids.
L:  Hm.
R:  Well, there's no excuse for what th- they did by any means but ... [inaudible] eighteen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  They should know better.
R:  Yeah, they just seem to be being held to a higher standard than ... than some of the other people.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I think, you know, then everyone's like, "Well, y- you know, it's too much TV!" 'cause you see it on TV.  I think about what happened to the woman wh- -- you know, the girl who went to the prom and gave birth to her baby and killed it and she did --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- four years and these kids are gonna do more time than that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I [NOISE] -- I don't agree with ... the philosophy do things because they see it on TV and that they're mimicking movies or television shows or, you know, they're -- they're subjected to the materials in the news and then Court TV, you know, getting all the details or whatnot, but I -- I strongly disagree with the fact that, "Oh, I did it because ... you know, I've ... learned it from watching this or that".  I think people ... you know, like little kids I can understand --
R:  Being influenced.
L:  -- younger.  But if they are a teenager or older, then I think that's just a lame cop out excuse.
R:  Yeah, they know better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and where are their parents?  That's what I say.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even with these kids, you know, where are the parents?  I -- I just [inaudible] bad kid then you've -- there's only so much you can do and ...
L:  But you know the difference between right and wrong when something's dying.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Whether it be an animal or a person.
R:  And it's tendencies.  I say if they're doing that to the animals that's just tendencies of what's to come.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That -- that could be -- they usually say that's like [LAUGH] all the psychopaths that have murdered people and they usually start out abusing animals.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's like a big sign.
L:  Well, that's k- -- yeah, that would be scary.
R:  Yeah.  You know, [LAUGH] well, it's like, wait a minute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I sold my qu- -- my nice little quiet town.
L:  Yeah, and I've been summonsed for jury duty, um, prob- two or three times in the past year.
R:  Wow!
L:  And it amazes me.  I've gotten out of it, um ... but like seeing court cases and whatnot in the media and on the Court TV that I don't think I would ever be able to ... actually go through one of those things and --
R:  Be sequestered and ...?
L:  And -- well, even just going through a trial and having ... to make the decision, whether guilty or not guilty and whatnot 'cause I can't even make a decision as to what I wanna eat at a restaurant.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right, that's true.
L:  But, I mean, there's just ... knowing that ... that would make such a big decision ... I don't know.  I guess it'd really depend on the case though.
R:  Yeah, it must -- uh, in that they -- everybody has to decide and then otherwise they do have, what?  They mistrial it and they start all over.
L:  Right.
R:  For the big ... for the big ... felony cases.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it's -- oh, i- i- I guess three times you've been called for jury duty in a year?
L:  Yeah, it's ... yeah, well, 'cause I've --
R:  That's --
L:  -- lived down here for ... April first was one year, so yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I've gotten out of it, um -- I'm originally --
