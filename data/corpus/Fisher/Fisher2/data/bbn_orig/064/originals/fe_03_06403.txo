R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi.  I'm Lyn.
R:  I'm Sonia.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine thank you.
R:  Good.  Okay, so the topic is terrorism.
L:  And do we think we would panic?
R:  Right.  [NOISE] And do we think most other people would panic?  Well, [LAUGH] I think that, um, personally I would try not to.  I think it would depend on who [PAUSE] I have around me, you know what I mean?  Like, if most of my family is around me and -- and I don't have to worry about where they are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I know we're all together --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think I'd be in a much calmer state of mind than if I couldn't find them.
L:  Well, and I think also it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would depend on, um, how close you were to the actual action --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and whether the people around you were panicking or not.
R:  Right, right.  I mean, y- you take nine eleven, you know ... I don't -- I think it was a bit [PAUSE] incredulous for most people, unless they were there.  Because things were happening so quickly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] and I know for me, I was pregnant and waiting to go to a doctor's appointment, and I was sad about it but I don't think I quite comprehended what --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was going on, or how devastating it truly was until later in the day, you know?
L:  Well, see, I work for American Airlines --
R:  Ooh!
L:  -- and I was there watching it on live TV.
R:  Whoa!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whoa!
L:  So ...
R:  How did you feel?
L:  Um, it -- 
R:  Did you know the people?
L:  I didn't personally know the people --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but we're all kind of a big family anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, I could appreciate ... to a certain extent that day, ah, what the loss of -- of life would mean just to our company.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And had I known, now in retrospect, with American in the financial straights that they are in now ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what all that would meant --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, to me personally --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I'd have been a lot sadder than I was that day.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  That sounds terrible, but --
R:  No.  It's true though.
L:  -- but seriously, uh, they -- they allowed us, um, after, you know, the Pentagon got hit and the plane went down in Pennsylvania --
R:  Right.  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and everything, they allowed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- us to go home if we chose.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Because, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- clearly, some of us were not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- able to cope with everything that day.
R:  Sure.
L:  I was one of them --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and I went.
R:  Wow!
L:  And, uh, I went home and bawled most of the day watching it on TV.  And then as soon as I could, I got my kid out of class --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as did most other parents.
R:  Yes, see with me, I was late for work anyway because of my doctor's appointment.  And ... I was with my husband fortunately and we went down to my job but decided not to stay because, you know, the longer we were in the car, the more information we were receiving --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  And you kinda wanted to --
R:  Yeah, it was like --
L:  -- watch it?
R:  -- yeah.  It was, like, okay, no, there's no way -- these people are at work and I'm in Atlanta so, I don't [NOISE] you know, you -- you start to -- to -- once it's in every city -- well, not every city but, you know, it went from New York to Washington --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're -- you're next thing is okay, where's it going next?
L:  Right.
R:  And what's going to happen?  
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and you start thinking about, okay, are they trying to ruin us financially?  Or, you know, so, yeah, we have a -- a lot of financial areas that could be destroyed.  Or are they trying to ruin us, you know, via power, you know, creating power outages and then you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- start thinking of how close --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- your residence or your job are to the different -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- power supplies so --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I'm not that far from a power plant either.
R:  Yeah, so [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you just, like, uh, I don't think it's a good ta- time for me [LAUGH] to be downtown or, you know, in the main thoroughfare of where they may try to hit next.  You just do not --
L:  Yeah, they actually evacuated some of the taller buildings in Dallas that day.
R:  Yeah!  Is that were you are, Dallas?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I just, ooh, like you said, especially for you is already a little too [NOISE] close to home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  By you working for that company and not knowing them directly but still knowing [NOISE] them in -- oh, my goodness -- I can't even imagine.  [NOISE] That's pretty awful.  So, how would you think you would react now, if something like that were to happen again?
L:  Ah, [SIGH] I think the first impulse would be to try and get a grip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, uh, you've got to keep --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a fairly clear head --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in case some action is required on your part.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, like I said, that -- that's -- it would all depend on how close you were to actually what was happening.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, um ... there was really no action for me to do that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- day, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  An- and I was non essential personnel so I got to go home.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And, uh, whereas, you know, some people were setting up, uh, twenty four, seven conference calls, and they were on them for several days --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, you know, we shut down all --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the airlines.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was, uh, a major event.  So --
R:  Man!
L:  -- had I had something to actively get into, I probably would have, you know, not been so emotional.
R:  Yeah, see, I --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- I can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I don't like to fly anyway, so I can't even imagine being a part of that whole scenario, you know, either American or United.  And [PAUSE] I think if it were to happen now, I guess it would be the same.  Well, now that I know a little bit more -- see we -- we're not used to that kind of --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- situation, which is why I think it caught so many of us off guard the first time.
L:  Well, the scary thing is I -- I -- w- -- really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you think about them contaminating --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the water, the food supplies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we're not used to any of it.
R:  No.  And if it were to happen even today, I don't think we would be prepared.
L:  No.  We wouldn't.  And we are really, um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at risk.  Extremely at risk.  More so than most of us even want to dare think about.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly, and I think that's the scary part now that we --
L:  I mean, think about -- you live in an all electric home.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  What happens if you don't have electricity?
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  You can't cook.  you can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- keep things in a refrigerator -- y- you know?
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Just little things like that.
R:  Exactly.  And even, you know, that little scare where they were saying to go and buy water and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and things to, um ... [NOISE] tape around the house and things like that.
L:  Ah, that's bullshit.
R:  Remember that?
L:  That's bullshit, about the plastic around the house.
R:  [NOISE] But then somebody else came back and said that you're really only going to have so much air left anyway [PAUSE] if something like that were to happen.  It just makes you feel defenseless.  It's like, what can you do?  I mean, why get scared because what can you do?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Pretty -- pretty muchly.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you really -- if -- if that happens, you're stuck --
L:  But I --
R:  -- and there's no getting around it.
L:  -- you know, I had to -- I had to, you know, tell my daughter, make some contingency plans, what to happen if anything happened over there.  You know, who goes where and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and who -- who go- comes to get her and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stuff like that, you know.
R:  It's pretty scary.  [NOISE]
L:  So, it's, uh, [SIGH] and you have little ones --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too, so I know that you're fearful for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for their safety --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- because they can't take care of themselves --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- whereas my daughter could try.  Uh --
R:  Right.  Yeah, see he's only -- well, he turned twenty months today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, obviously he [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Yeah, so you --
R:  -- if -- 
L:  -- would -- you would certainly have, uh, more things to worry about than --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would, but -- 
R:  Yeah.  I mean, he was born eleven days after --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- nine eleven, and it just -- it made that whole time -- I didn't know he was going to be born that close to it, but that whole time you're thinking, "Okay, I'm getting ready to bring a new life into the world [PAUSE] and what a world it is".
L:  Is that -- is that such a good thing?  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You know, look at what's going on.
L:  Yes, I --
R:  And you're so used to seeing it across -- you know, overseas -- not that that's any better, because you do sympathize with them, but you just really have no concept --
L:  We just don't think it's over here.
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you have no concept of what it really is.
L:  And what a world we're leaving them.
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes.  It's really pathetic.
L:  Yeah, we all thought things like that ... since then.
R:  I mean, the one good thing I would hope is that it made people closer though.  You know, it did for a while but --
L:  It did -- it still -- it still does because every morning now at seven o'clock on my radio station they sing the national anthem.
R:  Okay.
L:  Somebody -- some group -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- sings it.  And they didn't do that for a long, long time.
R:  Right.
L:  Not since I was a kid.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  We're -- we're still united.
R:  That's good. 
L:  And, uh -- and anything --
R:  Because I know that we really were when it first happened but it --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- just seems like, you know ...
L:  Yeah.  But anything further that happens is going to do the same thing
R:  Yeah.  Let's just hope there is nothing [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
L:  Which is kind of neat, but darn, I wished we could just do it without having something --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- tragic -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that prompts us.
R:  It's just like losing a family member.  You cry at their funeral and everything, but why couldn't you think about how good they were before they died?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And -- and, you know, shower them with the love and accolades before they passed away.  It's the same thing.  Why does it have to be to- --
