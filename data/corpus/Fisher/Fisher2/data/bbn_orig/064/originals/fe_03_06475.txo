L:  Hello, this is Margaret.
R:  Hi, my name's Wendy.
L:  Hi.  Um [LAUGH] I -- I ... I guess my opinion on today's topic is that it's a mistake to have especially the high profile things shown on TV 'cause it turns into a circus.  I've never watched anything like the O.J. trial.  What about yourself?
R:  Uh, I used to watch -- we used to -- we have Court TV on my cable system and they used to have, like, those, um, [LIPSMACK] shows on for an hour showing what the highlights were about the different cases.  But then they changed it to ... other court stuff which I don't think is interesting.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I -- I used to watch a lot of the Court TVs when they had those hour ... things.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But ... I mean, I guess they're gonna, um ... [SIGH] -- like, like, say, if there's like, how -- how -- how do I wanna say?  If it's like somebody important, like, one of the movie stars or somebody rich ... is like, yeah!  I'm sure they're gonna wanna put it on and people are gonna watch it, you know what I mean?  Because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ... you know, just to see if there's -- I guess it -- my opinion, see, if -- if they're gonna get away with it or --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I just wonder whether it ... if justice is really served when the media gets involved because they're [SIGH] -- it's so easily skewed once they, um, start -- oh ... oh, just -- just televising it.  It -- it makes it too fictionalized or too easy to make it fictionalised.
R:  I know 'cause when I got picked, um, for jury tr- d- duty twice before, it's like they ask you those questions: do you know the people involved?  Have you ever been involved in a automobile accident --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you have to go up and, you know, say why.  And, you know, if you have and so I guess they don't want nobody to be, um -- I guess, have an opinion.  Li- like if I do something they wa- want my father on the ju- -- you know what I mean?  
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  So ... but -- but some of those ca- -- I -- I know what you mean because, um, some of those cases are, yeah.  Let me get on there, yeah, 'cause I -- I just ... I -- I guess it's like I hate to see, um ... [COUGH] I guess if somebody hurt a -- like, a child or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know that'd be the type it was like, "Yeah.  Let me get on there" you know?  'Cause I don't think that, you know, people should hurt kids but then I know if you in jail and if you hurt a kid they're gonna get you anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I figure, yeah -- yeah, justice is gonna be done a little bit even though I'm not on there, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even because I know that, uh, if I was married, which I'm not, and I killed my husband or my boyfriend because he was abusing me, they wouldn't do anything to me but if I hurt a kid they would.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that seems to be the way it is.  They throw -- they have thrown a lot of women who killed their abusers into prison though so I don't know.  I'm -- I have very, um ... [SIGH] I don't trust the legal system too well [LAUGH] because the -- oh, [SIGH] it just seems too easily manipulated.
R:  I know because I -- uh, one of my girlfriends, her son's going through a divorce and it's like the -- [SIGH] from what I hear about the separated wife, she ain't too nice, you know, but then it's like I know their side of the story, not her side.  But --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But I just hope that it turns out okay because it's like from what I'm seeing, they're only letting the dad see the -- his son every other weekend and -- and it's like she don't want the -- the -- the -- her kid to go and visit the grandparents and, well, he loves the grandparents and -- and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and everybody.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's like, "Let him visit!"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, it's like they're hurting the kid but, you know ...  Me -- I think she is but, you know, I just hope things work out.
L:  Right, right.  The, um ... well, divorce is where there are kids that they often seem to use the children for hurting the parents, and it probably is worse on the children --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than it ever would be for the ex partner.  Yeah.
R:  That is true.
L:  Yeah.  But ... no, [SIGH] I think that, um, considering how much ... attention there was for things like the O.J. Simpson trial that there are better things that the ... that, you know, the energy and the money could be spent better than running it on TV and going on about it for months.  And he still walked. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  You know, it was -- it's -- I hope -- well, I didn't pay any ov- -- like, I wasn't following the trial mainly because I figured he was gonna get away with it regardless of what happened.  Um ... so [SIGH] anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I figure he was gonna walk and I know, um, the people that used to rent from us, they just moved out this week at -- I mean, at work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they was happy that he walked.
L:  Happy?
R:  So, it was like, you know, I guess you got the money you can do anything.  You know --
L:  Yeah.  I figured that it was gonna be that he could buy his way out of it.  Um, it sure looks like that's the case.
R:  I know 'cause I know when I was out in California back in ninety five, they was saying, "Oh, yeah, that's where O.J. lives" and they was pointing over to this building so --
L:  Mm.  Big deal.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Well, um ... I guess I -- I've made up my mind on this, um -- today's topic so I really don't know, um ... what else there is to say especially since I've never watched any of those trials.  I don't watch much TV.
R:  I -- I know what you mean 'cause I was visiting my girlfriend; she lives out in the country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she can't afford, um -- you have to have satellite TV.  She says, "I can't afford it" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was like ... you don't have all the good channels on like -- she likes to watch like I do and I'm like, "You don't have the good channels!"
L:  Yeah, well, then she'll get more reading done.
R:  Oh, I know so I -- I -- I guess I would- -- I mean, because where I live at, I have to have, um, cable and because you can't --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- get clear channels so --
L:  Right.  Yeah, I -- I know a lot of buildings are like that in the cities.
R:  Uh, uh, I'm -- uh, uh, my town is not a big city 'cause I'm close to -- my next biggest city's Philadelphia so it's not -- we're not as big as they are but still --
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  But I- I- I know but -- but then too I just knew growing up -- where I grew up at we didn't have proper transportation because the town I lived in was smaller than where I live at now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so if you couldn't get out to go where you wanted, I said I felt that was prison, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You had to depend on your parents to go out so it was like that's why I never got into trouble 'cause I said, "Uh-uh".
L:  [LAUGH] That's good.
R:  But -- but then I too -- I work for the State of Delaware and I know if you have a felony on your record they don't hire ya and I --
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yes and -- but then I think it depends on what kind it is, you know?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If -- if it's unusual circumstances maybe they'll let you slide but I know ... it's like, um ... about three years five months left before retirement so I was like, "I ain't jeopardizing nothing since I'm that close to retirement" so --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't wanna mess up on [SIGH] your pension fund.
R:  Oh, yes, especially the way the, um, economy is nowadays.
L:  [LAUGH] No kidding.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] and I know, um, two people work, um -- kinda got in a little bit of trouble --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I says, "I don't understand", um [LIPSMACK] I was really surprised at one guy 'cause he kinda made the comment --
