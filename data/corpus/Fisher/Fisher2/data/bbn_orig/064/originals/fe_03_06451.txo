R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  I'm Donna.
R:  Hi.  I'm Joe.  I'm out here in Los Angeles, California.
L:  Oh, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm there all the time.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But -- well, as far as trials go and watching trials -- I watched part of the O.J. Simpson trial and I was a street cop out here in Los Angeles at the time.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, it was very disheartening for us to, ah, you know -- we all pretty much figured that O.J. was guilty and -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, just watching the, you know -- the -- all the -- the money that he spent on his defense and watching him beat up the LAPD was very disheartening and it w- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really lowered morale.
L:  Yeah.  Well, um, I was invol- -- n- -- involved as a victim.  Um, my son was killed in the, um, [LIPSMACK] bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi.
R:  Oh, that's horrible.
L:  Yeah.  And then the government, ah, you know, allowed us to attend the trial up in New York.  And the word that you used was [SIGH] so interesting -- it was just so disheartening.
R:  Yes.
L:  It just, um -- you know, the stuff that they're not allowed to put in.
R:  Of course.
L:  And, um ...  I mean, like, the one fellow that drove the truck right into the embassy, you know, admitted he did it, said he'd do it again.  And, ah, he would turn around and smirk at the victims and, you know, just -- it just really [SIGH] soured me on the whole justice system.  I mean, what's the point of catching the damn fools and -- you know?
R:  But -- but do you think if -- I mean, w- was that televised when he was turning around and --
L:  No.
R:  -- smirking at the victims?
L:  N- no.
R:  Do you think if it was --
L:  No.  The whole thing wasn't televised.
R:  -- think if that was televised it might give people a different view of our legal system?
L:  Well, the thing is, a lot of what I saw go on in the courtroom [inaudible] at the trial, was not televised.  But -- hold on please [COUGH] -- but I don't think they televised a lot of that.
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, you know, they would -- you know, if they were gonna say the guy had chopped the heads off three people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'd send the jury out and then they'd say, "No, you can't say that" and bla- -- you know?  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  All this crap you couldn't say.  And I -- I think that the TV thing would be the same way.
R:  Th- they don't show the little stuff like the, ah -- may- -- the, ah, accused, you know, smirking and smiling every time they show the -- the -- the dismembered body parts and --
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And then y- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, making threatening motions to the -- the police officers when they're testifying.
L:  That's it -- yeah.  Like the ambassador, um, who was heard in, ah, the -- Prudence Bushnell -- she was saying she was up on the stand and, of course, then she's facing them and while she's describing this -- and I mean, she's trembling and all this and that -- and the guy is sitting there grinning at her and picking his teeth.
R:  Of course.
L:  Y- [LAUGH] you know and ...
R:  These people don't care.  They really don't have a conscience.
L:  Oh, no they -- they don't -- they don't.  And that's -- that's what's so ... [SIGH] So, [SIGH] televised or not I just, you know -- I just, kinda, go, "Well, what's -- ".  And then, of course, they didn't get the death penalty.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And the ev- -- you know, I mean, they said they did it -- no doubt.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, they admitted it.  Es- -- and especially the one, Oday that, you know, drove the truck and all.  Well, then [SIGH] the F- -- the ju- -- yeah, the FBI sent us the sheet --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that the jury filled out.  You know, they got -- you -- you are aware of those things, you know --
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  -- this many questions and et cetera.  And, you know, why -- why are you voting this way and that?  Well, they were young.  They were of a different culture. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, we're s- -- and, "Oh, life imprisonment will be hard for them so that's enough punishment".  And, of course --
R:  That -- they asked -- I remember during OJs trial when they -- when, you know, the televised thing and -- when they finally came back with the not guilty verdict --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we were wondering -- I mean, [LAUGH] what kind of morons do they put on the jury? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you're -- you're just -- you wonder.
R:  [MN]
L:  You really -- I mean [SIGH] -- and to -- to re- --
R:  They have all the evidence but the actual videotape of people doing it.  And even in the cases where they do have a videotape --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and they say, "Well, that might not -- they might be somebody else with make up on" and, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it doesn't -- you know, especially for somebody -- I know your son was killed and I'm in law enforcement right now --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's very -- it's, ah, frustrating and disheartening.
L:  Huh.  Oh, it's -- it's just so ...  And I mean, you know, that's why now, you know, they run after all these damn terrorists.  And, you know, I -- granted, we don't want 'em out doing any more.  But on the other hand -- oh, and then of course -- and, of course, as a police officer, you know too -- we coddle these guys to death -- I mean, not to death -- we just coddle them like crazy.
R:  Oh, yes.  'Cause, I mean --
L:  You know?
R:  -- we don't -- our legal -- and we try to abide by our constitution and our legal system.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Actually -- you know, things have, kinda, changed that now that it's considered a war, we are allowed to -- ah, on foreign soil, take these people out.
L:  Well, yeah.  But, you know?
R:  But, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  Still -- and -- and the problem with the terrorists is if you get a tele- televised trial you get the Muslim fundamentalists --
L:  True.
R:  -- who get all involved.  And -- and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- they're worried about more bombings.
L:  That's right.  Well, yeah.  And -- and -- 'cause I know that, ah -- and, like, the sentencing for our guys came up at the same time of, um, [LIPSMACK] not Terry Nichols, was it -- who was the -- McVeigh -- that McVeigh was put to death.  So, they were worried that, you know, that was gonna impact on our trial and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know?
R:  W- --
L:  But I just, you know -- I -- I just -- the whole damn criminal justice system just -- and the thing is, these FBI g- guys who as what I know, were officers like yourself -- I mean, you are going out and putting your life on the line to haul these guys in --
R:  Yes.
L:  And then what for?  You know?
R:  Well, and -- another thing about that is, you know, being on tele- -- you know, television, you've gotta hide your identity being an officer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because especially on these terrorist trials you get the Muslim fundamentalists, they see who you are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're gonna hunt you down and d- -- attack your family or yourself.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Um, which, you know, it's -- it's probably -- it's a privacy issue and I know they got that, ah, one terrorist right now w- wants to interview other terrorists.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, it's kinda --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- hard to give him a --
L:  Masawi[?].
R:  -- fair trial without, you know, causing all these problems.
L:  Yeah.  But why the hell -- why the hell should he get a fair trial?  I mean, I -- I just come to their point[?].  Why the hell should he get a fair trial?  You know, he didn't give a fair trial to ... you know?  Just --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Just like these guys -- four guys.  And then, like, this one guy -- Wadih El Hage, in the Nairobi trial -- he is an American citizen -- a naturalized.
R:  Yes.
L:  Now, his wife and son attended the trial and -- and I can go with that.  I mean, I'm -- I'm decent enough person -- okay, they got a right, you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  But then it -- El Hage wanted to see his twelve year old son.  Okay.  You know, at this point I'm thinking, "Well, the son has nothing to do with this" so that's okay too.  But then, El Hage says, "Well, I won't see him unless I can see him without any shackles or anything 'cause I don't want my boy to see me with shackles on". [LAUGH]  And the damn judge said, "Well, okay, we can arrange that". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, where -- what was Wadih El Hage worrying about a year ago when he bombed people?
R:  Normally, in -- you know, I worked, really, in the federal prison system too.  Normally, in a case like that they would put him behind glass.  They would -- they would take the shackles off but they'd be behind glass and talk over a phone.
L:  Well, yeah.  But why should we be so damn sensitive?  I mean, if he wasn't sensitive enough to his kid a year ago, why should we, all of a sudden, you know, grant every sensitivity?
R:  Oh, I understand.  It -- just we're --
L:  You know?
R:  -- Americans and we try to be better than everybody else and --
L:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
R:  And -- but oth- -- the other people, of course, won't understand.  And I know you're a victim in the whole thing and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's very -- it's awful.  And, ah -- but, ah -- a- and, you know, of course, when they do televise these trials it gets people all riled up.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And they think we're even --
L:  Well, they only see half of it, which is --
R:  Yeah, they only see half of it.  A- and probably, you know, you see what's really going on but there's people who probably say, "Oh, we're still treating 'em too roughly --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- we should treat 'em better".
L:  Mm.  Oh, god.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and there's always people out there they say[?], "Are you fighting for prisoners rights" and --
L:  Right.
R:  And they don't understand how far people go out of their way to take care of these people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  I know.
R:  You know, the -- the televised trials -- people -- they'll see, you know, um -- you know, this -- this guy who looks like a college student --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who, of course, y- -- they -- you know, under -- under his jumpsuit or whatever -- or under his suit, he's got all the -- the gang tattoos and the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, how many people he's killed and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how many women he's raped.  And, it just, ah -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- it's --
L:  Yeah.  But boy, he comes in looking as good as your son, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I think --
L:  With the suit and the -- if -- if not a suit, you know, he's got this -- the cardigan sweater on and -- you know?
R:  Yes.  Of course.  I -- I mean, and when I was doing the Mexican Mafia trials out here in Los Angeles --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they look like college students.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They had the fake glasses with the -- w- -- and their short haircuts and the suits at [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, really?  Fake glasses? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah -- of course.  And, um, if they saw -- if people saw that on television they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're gonna say, "These guys look like college students --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- they look like, you know, neighbors -- they look like good kids".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But these people are [LAUGH] hard core murderers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that would kill you in a second.
L:  And will do it again.
R:  An- and so, you know, the -- the television doesn't really show the whole thing.
L:  No, it doesn't.
R:  And, ah --
L:  'Cause, like, we -- we listen -- you know, we were able to listen to some of the tapes and everything and it just -- you know, it just --
R:  Yeah.  I think, sometimes, the newspapers do a better job of actually describing these smirks and the grins and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and the actions that really go on in a courtroom.
L:  Well, what I'm printing off right now -- I've been working on it for a week or two -- is part of the transcript of the, ah, Nairobi trial, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, that's fascinating 'cause we only attended a couple of weeks and, of course, it went on for a couple of months, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, it was just unbelievable --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- to see how the judge would bend over backwards, "Oh, no -- you can't say that, you can't say this".  And we're sitting there, "Well, why the heck shouldn't the jury know that he did whatever?"  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I'd -- you know, see the problem with that is the judge has to do that because otherwise everything will get overturned on an appeal and there's a chance they might actually get fr- -- you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- be set free.
L:  Yeah.  But it's real aggravating, you know?  It's --
R:  Oh, it's -- it's terrible for the victim.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, it's like you're a victim twice.
L:  Mhm.  That's true.  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  And again too for the agents that are -- you know, the officers too that go and get these guys.  And then --
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's -- it's -- it's horrible when you get somebody that you know is guilty and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like O.J.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We were all on alert that day.  I mean, [LAUGH] we had everybody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we had people -- rifles and shotguns.  I worked in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the ghetto --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the Bronx[?]. And we were ready for people just to go wild.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  And if he was found guilty.  Yeah.
R:  Ah, yes.  And --
L:  Oh, it -- it would've been another --
R:  An- and then we all were gathered around our -- our squad car or, you know, roadblocks and that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, ready -- I mean ...  We were just, ah -- just waiting for -- we had our riot gear on --
L:  Mm.
R:  And then when the, ah, not guilty verdict --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- came out, two minutes later they said, "Alert called off".  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they all [inaudible].
L:  Well, the funny thing was -- is the end[?] jury -- excuse my French -- couldn't even make a pretense of deliberating.
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, there's what?  A- -- how long was the trial?  Three months or whatever?
R:  I think they were just out what?  A few hours?  Something --
L:  And they were just out for -- yeah.  Like, ninety -- an hour or so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  And if that was a poor person, of course --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if it wasn't a celebrity, they would have -- they'd be in jail for life right now.
