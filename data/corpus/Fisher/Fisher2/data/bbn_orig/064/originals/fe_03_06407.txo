R:  Ann.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- Ann, who are you?
L:  My name is Terri.
R:  Hi Terri.  Terrorism huh?
L:  Boy, yeah, the first two calls I had were pretty low key subjects.  I can't believe they picked this one.
R:  Did ya?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm not surprised though.
L:  Well, it's topical but, gee!  And I don't know where you live, I live near Washington DC and they've, you know, we gotta have really heavy, um, security right now 'cause they've upped the alert.
R:  Right.  Now that's orange --
L:  And they think the subways might be a target this weekend so, they have -- I work right near a subway.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  They had US Marshalls all around and -- and everything.
R:  Is that what you do?
L:  No.  No.  Um --
R:  Oh!  Oh, you just [inaudible]?
L:  -- no, I just -- they're very visible right now.
R:  Oh --
L:  But --
R:  -- well, my husband is in security at the Federal Reserve Bank in Illinois --
L:  Mhm 
R:  -- and yeah.  I mean, there's always -- there always heightened security.
L:  Well, since th- --
R:  Always have to be really cautious.
L:  I work for the Pentagon. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh!  Well, so, you know about that?
L:  Well, I just started a couple of months ago so, there I was --
R:  How do you like it?
L:  Well, it's -- it's fine.
R:  Yeah, it's fine?
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  Um, it's not quite what I had envisioned myself doing but, [LAUGH] um, but -- we're supposed to be talking about terrorism.
R:  Well, that's a scary thing.  You're right; I don't know how you can stay calm during terrorism.
L:  Duri- -- well, no, during a terrorist attack th- they were very general with this.
R:  Yes, they were.
L:  W- -- so, it could be something like ... [MN] riding on the subway and you smell smoke and somebody says there's been an attack, and everybody needs to evacuate calmly, or something.  Could be something like that; could be something a lot more dramatic, um ...
R:  It's a pretty open question but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know how you can stay calm.  I mean, everybody's ... panicking inside I believe.
L:  Yeah, but just -- I -- I would tend to think that probably most people would.  Because -- especially at the Pentagon, that's exact- ... I know they wouldn't -- maybe because they were military and they were trained.  That had something to do with it.  But when they had the attack there eighteen months, people stayed very calm, did what -- got -- got people out of the building, sent s- -- assistance where they needed it, and got things done.   Didn't seem as if anybody panicked at the Pentagon.  So, I think --
R:  Well, that's a good thing.
L:  -- you know, maybe we can be hopeful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we always, you know, for ourselves, we never know, but I would like to think that I would stay calm, be -- I'd be afraid, but that I could stay calm and sort of pay attention to getting myself out of there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, and I think -- I think most people -- most people, um, would -- would be frightened but would be able to -- t- to sort of focus on what needed to be done rather than -- than panicking and running rampant and, you know, trampling other people.  What --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- so -- so, you don't think -- you think that most people would panic?
R:  Well, I don't think they would [MN] -- yeah, I guess I have less faith than p- -- in people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think most people would panic.
L:  Hm.  When you say most, you mean, like, ninety percent, eighty percent, ninety nine percent? 
R:  Yeah, seventy percent.
L:  Seventy per- -- that's still -- okay, there's still a goodness -- this is about a third staying calm so, um ...  Now I don't remember in New York, uh, things happened so quickly but even th- they didn't know it was a terrorist attack but people seemed to -- there -- stay calm and start evacuating.  All they knew there was that there might be a fire or something so ...
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I don't think we've ever had th- ... we don't really have anything to look to, to see what people did before, do we?
R:  Well, even when it is a terrorist attack, like, y- you made a good point, most people aren't aware it's a terrorist attack.
L:  I think nowadays -- I think nowadays if something happens, people are spooked.  First thing --
R:  They think.
L:  -- people are going to think.  Now, when we had the sniper back in October, before he was caught, a lot of people were wondering if it might be terrorist activity.  But they, you know, pe- people stayed -- they were jittery but they didn't panic.  I was pretty -- I was pretty proud of, um [PAUSE] us [LAUGH] --
R:  It doesn't really help to panic.
L:  -- that way, you know.  Some people stayed home, but a lot of people still went out and did things and just were very, very watchful.
R:  Huh.  You have more faith in people than I do.
L:  Oh, well, see --
R:   [LAUGH]
L:  -- I sort of -- [LAUGH] I just sort of hope for the best
R:  But then you work in a cap- -- at the Pentagon, I'm glad they're calm there.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I mean, as I said, that might not be -- that might not be good to -- to judge the population in general because they're all military or mo- -- well, no, there are civilian workers there but we've got a lot of military people who are trained how to act in an emergency under pressure --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, maybe -- maybe that's the only reason.  But I --
R:  [NOISE] There goes the dogs.  You're right.
L:  I would sort of like to think that we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all have that capacity, or most of us have that capacity.  Now, I wasn't in a -- under a terrorist attack but I was one time in a realy bad c- car accident where --
R:  [NOISE] You were one time in a what?  I'll shut them up with cookies!
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] guys.
L:  A bad car accident.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the car caught fire and, um -- while we were in it.  And the driver and I, you know, we -- we were a little excited but we didn't panic.  So, um, I don't know, I think a lot of us, we sort of picture things from our movie watching and television watching, we just always sort of figure if there's a fire or an earthquake of some kind of emergency, we just get these rolling panics of people turning into mush, but, um, you know, I'm not quite sure that's really what happens all the time.
R:  Hm.  [PAUSE] I'd like to think that --
L:  Have you kn- -- have you ever known anybody that w- -- has been in some kind of, um, emergency situation and then told you what it was like later?
R:  [PAUSE] No.  One time I had a -- on a train I had a guy coming at somebody with a knife.
L:  Oh!  Well, that sounds sort of emergency like.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, you --
L:  He was -- you could see the guy wasn't all there when he was standing there.  He was mumbling --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and talking, you know.  And that there was always someone that's gonna agitate him on, which is the wrong thing to do --
L:  Oh, no!
R:  -- when you can tell somebody's not all there.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  He kept telling him to get off the train, that everybody was comfortable with him.  So the guy did get --
L:  Oh, God!
R:  -- off the train, and then he came on through another door at him with a knife.
L:  Oh, di- --
R:  And everybody was screaming and freaking.
L:  Okay.
R:  I just kinda stayed and watched to see what would happen, but that wasn't a terrorist or anything.
L:  No.  But -- but people were screaming, which seems normal.  We- were people panicking?  Like, all rushing for the door and knocking each other down or anything?
R:  Yeah, they were all going for the door.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  And this was before all the terrorist stuff happened.
L:  Well, I'm dying to know, did -- did -- did anyone get hurt?  Was everything okay?
R:  Others stabbed him, the cops came, you know, I mean, he -- [LAUGH] he was nuts in the beginning, you'd --
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  -- only agitate a nut already.
L:  How dramatic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How dramat- -- how -- how traumatic for you. You didn't get hurt, did you?
R:  I was afraid to move.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was -- I was afraid to call attention to myself.  I just sat there, you know.  No, I didn't.
L:  Well, that was pretty smart actually.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause, "Oh, there's someone else" you know?  Just grabbed somebody going for the door or whatever.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, my God, that's the most dramatic thing I think I've ever heard.
R:  Here at the Federal Reserve they're trained to be very calm too ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in case of an emergency and there're guards and security.  [PAUSE] But yet one time something happened -- I don't remember what it was to be honest with you.  But I -- [LAUGH] I remember they got mad at one of the guards 'cause he hid under the desk.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I guess it takes all kinds.  That was kinda funny.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, he has a gun and he's trained to protect and he's a guard.
L:  He's a guard!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he hid under a desk.  They had it on video.
L:  Oh, that poor man.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You imagine that?
L:  Did he have to quit?
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, I don't get paid enough for this stuff, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Mm.  Well, I'm hoping we don't have to find out what people would do --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- in a terrorist attack.  Now --
R:  But I'll keep it in mind that if something does happen where I think that's -- that is what it is, I'll try to stay calm.
L:  I --
R:  That's really the only way to react.
L:  Well, I mean, if we just -- just sort of a grim conversation, but if we think about the people in the airplanes, especially that one in Pennsylvania, they didn't panic.  It was just amazing how they did not panic.
R:  Right.
L:  They -- and they were all obviously -- they knew what was going on and they were afraid, but they not only didn't panic, but they made plans.  So --
R:  Isn't that great?
L:  Yeah.  So, I think, you know, I think w- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we -- we should think -- take that as --
R:  Positive.
L:  -- encouragement and, um -- see that as much as a potential for the -- the sort of wild panic that we're taught will happen when there are emergency situations.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, gosh, I sort of wish they'd picked another topic for us to talk about.
R:  Me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I know --
R:  The last two were like that for me, and the first one was great.
L:  The first one I -- I -- we talked about -- if you, uh, give up a best friend for a million dollars.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And --
R:  That was an easy one to discuss.
L:  -- then the -- oh, yeah.  That means -- every -- course you wouldn't.  Um, and then the second was computer games, which was, you know, not as interesting for me but easy to talk about.  Now, this one is not -- I feel sort of superstitious about it 'cause I -- when -- when I finish talking might go look -- watch the news, the CBS News [LIPSMACK] and, uh, I noticed all the guards around today and, um -- around the subways and around the different Pentagon offices.  There's some off site offices that are not right in the -- the Pentagon building but they're in office buildings in suburban Virginia --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just -- just within, like, half a mile --
