L:  [MN] My name is, Anna Menns[?] ... uh --
R:  Hi.  I'm, Sheila -- hi, I'm Sheila Phillips.
L:  Hi, Sheila.
R:  Hi.  Where are you from?
L:  Uh, I'm living in Florida right now, St Petersburg, Flor- --
R:  Oh, my goodness, I'm at -- I'm in Oregon.
L:  Are you?
R:  Way across the country and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's darned m- muggy over here.  I'm sure it is in Florida too.
L:  Oh, it's pretty hot, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Topic of the day is terrorism.  What a [LAUGH] grue- --
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] what a great subject I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm really actually kind of sick of hearing about it.
L:  Yeah, I am too.
R:  Um, I, uh -- I don't care.  My theory is, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, if it's our time to go, it's our time to go.  I don't really worry about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  I sort of think that too.  I mean, what am I going to do about it anyway?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I don't --
R:  I think --
L:  -- and I think -- 
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- you know, I don't like how TV keeps pushing it.  You know, I mean, they -- I think they create an atmosphere ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that almost produces terrorism, because they talk about it and, you know, every place you turn, ev- you know, every news, everything, they're always saying it's going to happen, it's going to happen; we gotta get ready, we gotta get ready.  And [MN] you know, things are getting more and more -- more scary and violent, and nothing happens.
R:  Well, I -- I wa- --
L:  I mean, you know --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- but I mean, no -- nothing is happening more than just normal kind of living, you know.
R:  Well, member wh- a while back when they ha- what were we supposed to buy -- duct tape and plastic or something, and there were theses boxes of duct tape --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- tape up by the check stand.  My kids had to tell me what they were for 'cause I didn't even know and, I mean, we buy duct tape to put little stars on us when we go suntanning and [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was, like, not to do our windows or whatever [LAUGH] we were supposed to be doing -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- good gosh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, how would you re- let's see, what is other half?  How would you react if a terrorist attack, which I think is kind of vague because it doesn't specifically say what kind.  Is it going to be --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, chemical or a building falling on me or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd like to be cremated though, if [LAUGH] at all possible [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't want to be buried [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  Huh.
R:  No, I think -- no, I think cremation's the best way.  I don't want to take up extra land, it's kind of crazy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They say most imports are -- us that aren't born in Oregon, that come from the mid West, don't want to be buried [LAUGH] they took a survey or something about it --
L:  Really.
R:  -- most of us want to be cremated, yeah -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that moved out here.
L:  Uh-huh   So --
R:  So --
L:  -- yeah, I think I'm going to get cremated too but ... so, I don't think I'd be very happy if a -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, a terrorist --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- attack happened again I think.  I was very freaked out that last time it happened ...
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I w-, you know, it was very stressful.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I was --
L:  I don't think it's going to happen --
R:  -- I was in the newspaper business and, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- when I heard it, my boss called me from Portland and told me that my, uh, paper account was going to be doubled because of what happened, and my first thought was, "Wow, I'm going to sell a lot of papers". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I -- then I felt bad for everybody and I felt really rotten that I felt that way but --
L:  Well --
R:  -- it was so far away I couldn't even -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I seriously didn't relate to it.  It's sad that it happened but ... 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stuff happens [LAUGH].
L:  Well, yeah, and I --
R:  That's my thinking.
L:  -- you know, right, it's nothing new -- it's not news that this country and world has, you know, been doing wars and been, you know, much more into violence than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- into peace.  Then, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's nothing new about that.  You know --
R:  Well, don't you think --
L:  -- I mean --
R:  -- it's pretty c- it's pretty neat thought that, you know, like, World War I and II -- look at poor England and all those countries in Europe, [LAUGH] how they got all bombed up and here we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we've been realy fortunate that we haven't had that problem.  What?  Just Pearl Harbour and that really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wasn't very much so, maybe it's our time, you know, to be ...
L:  Yes, yes. 
R:  -- hit with something.  I don't know.
L:  That's possible, yeah.  Right.
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, because, you know, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- life is pretty, um ... and I think it's -- it's ... you know, I wish I could follow the philosophy of, you know, and I don't know exactly what religion or phil- or philosophy that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you just take one day at a time.  And you just try to be peaceful in your own life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with your own family, your own friends, and hope that that's just going to spread, you know, and keep spreading.  I mean, that's how --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I feel about things.  And because I don't --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- mean I don't, mm, just in my own life, you know, any kind of little kind of violence for me -- I mean, you know, it's very stressful.  I mean I don't want to -- I was just thinking -- just, you know, before this phone call, how many times I've been, um ... attacked.  I mean, just me personally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, like, on the street, you know, and, you know, various times, and I thought, you know, I don't think that's unusual -- I think that happens to people.  People get into situations that, you know, are, um, you know, violent.  And, um, we just, you know, have to live through it and deal with it, and hope that peace and harmony will, you know, ke- come more than it is.  And, you know, that will be -- less people will get attacked, you know.
R:  You bet.  You bet.  I, um, gosh, we've never been mugged or anything [LAUGH].  We lead --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- really boring lives out here, nothing --
L:  No, well --
R:  -- much happens [LAUGH].
L:  -- well I'm glad if that happens. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Golly.
L:  -- well, no, I mean, you know, I'm glad that that -- that is true.  And then I'm glad that that happ- that people -- and I think that, you know, it's good that -- that you -- that happens to you, I mean, you must have done something in your life to help that hap- to happen.  You know --
R:  Right --
L:  -- I mean, you --
R:  -- I think we've just --
L:  -- you live -- you live a peaceful life and so you're -- I'm glad.
R:  I don't know, I never thought about it that way.  I just figure we live in a good part of the country, you know --
L:  Right, well --
R:  -- it rains all the time but I'll take the rain, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's okay [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, right.  
R:  So ...
L:  So, you know, I mean, you protect yourself -- there's ways that you protect yourself, you know.
R:  Yes, I suppose.  I --
L:  I mean, it --
R:  -- suppose you're right, yes.
L:  Sure, yeah.  I mean, just because, you know, you want to be happy and stay alive and you're -- you're family -- you want to protect your family.  So I think that you, you know, you live you're life trying to protect yourself as best you can.  You know, no matter --
R:  Yes.
R:  -- what's happened -- when -- no matter what's happening.  You know, I mean, that's what life is about; trying to, you know, keep yourself going and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being ... being happy and trying to s- stay ... comfortable [MN].  And, you know, I mean, you've -- you probably spend a lot of effort doing that.  I mean you probably work, and all those things you do.  I mean, when you think about it, you know, just your life, the way you live -- lead your day to day life, you protect yourself.  You know, you live in a certain neighbourhood if you can.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, you're --
R:  That's -- yeah, you're right, you're right.
L:  -- yeah, I mean, you know, you don't go --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- pl- some places that you know things happen at night, alone, if you're a women especially.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you -- we know what happens, we read the news, we see who gets killed.  And --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- you know --
R:  Exactly.  
L:  -- and so you --
R:  Okay, I think you're ri- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- agree with you.  Yes, you're right.  Yes.  You don't --
L:  So, you know, you're --
R:  -- really --
L:  -- right.  So we're responsible for our own lives really [MN].
R:  So, when -- when they come over and attack us, well, you know ... [LAUGH] we'll live -- or not --
L:  Right.  And, you know --
R:  -- it doesn't matter [LAUGH].
L:  -- another thing -- right, another thing is too --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that, you know, maybe [COUGH] the way you lead your life will make it less likely that the terrorists will attack.  You know, I mean, 'cause with, you know, it's like, just a philosophy of ... you know, like, the buddhist philosophy that, you know ... and -- and -- and Christian philosophy both.  I mean, most religions, the philosophy is that if you love your neighbor and yourself, and that kind of feeling -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- spreads, there's less likely to be a terrorist attack.
R:  Hm.
L:  Don't you -- you know, because I mean, I -- I think that would make me f- it makes me feel more calm to think of peaceful things.  You know, I mean, like, nature and, you know, stuff like that.  I mean, that's peaceful kind of ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- life.  I mean, that's the kind of life I'd like to live -- lead.  So --
R:  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  True.  My neighbors don't like me too well.  I -- I just keep waiting for a someone to come over and yell at me but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my mower broke and my grass is getting high in the front yard and last year a tree fell on my car, and it took me, like, eight months to get the tree out of the yard 
L:  Oh, God, it's funny, well -- 
R:  -- 'cause I was waiting for someone and they called the county on me --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I -- I --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- wish I'd called them a really bad word [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well you know what happened to me two years ago?
R:  Mm.
L:  A tree fell on my roof.
R:  Oh, no [LAUGH].
L:  In fact I'm -- yeah I'm still dealing with it.  I'm trying to get the insurance company [MN] -- 'cause it got struck by lightning and half of the tree fell on my roof and, you know --
R:  Oh my good- --
L:  -- my insurance is supposed to pay for that 'cause I paid insurance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm having a hassle, you know, to get them to pay for the repair.
R:  Oh, shoot.  
L:  Isn't that funny? 
R:  We had two house fires in two years --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  -- or, every two years it seems we're having one --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I got really icky[?] insurance that it won't ev- until June twenty third of this year --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I can't have anything happen because they won't even cover the cost of the loan.  I've just got the bottom of the -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- line insurance.  No one will insure me, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because they think I'm going to have a third one.  Well, like I set any of them?  You know, I don't know.
L:  So you have --
R:  But ...
L:  -- insurance now?  Or you don't?
R:  I do, but it's really poor insurance --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the insurance company -- it's through Oregon Fairplan[?], they said it just -- 'cause insurance company will take me ...
L:  Right, I -- I'm in same --
R:  -- for the losses somebody has to [LAUGH] but --
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- insurance companies really are multi million dollar corporations.  They don't care about people, you know?
R:  I know.  I think I'm in the wrong business.
