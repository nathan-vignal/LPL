R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Natalie.
R:  Hi, I'm Wanda.
L:  Wanda, how are you?
R:  Oh, fine.  And yourself?
L:  Doing okay.  You're on a cellphone?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  On the run?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What?
R:  Ye- yeah.  Well --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- today's topic is terrorism.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think most people would stay calm?
R:  Definitely not.  Um, I don't know where you're from, but I'm from New York so --
L:  Argh.
R:  -- I witnessed the whole September eleven thing and it's not something where, you know, you can just sit back and think[?], "Oh, you know, they blew up something".  No, I don't think -- you know, even -- even though I wasn't near Manhattan at the time, it wasn't something --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that, you know, we stood calm, you know, we were worrying, you know, for people that -- people, friends --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, coworkers --
L:  Sure.  Y- --
R:  -- stuff like that so ...
L:  -- you have first hand information.  I don't think people would stay calm either.
R:  Right.
L:  I think they --
R:  Well, I don- -- I just don't know whether it was uh, you know -- whether it happens here in New York or in any other city, or any other country, nobody's going to stay calm.  You know --
L:  No.
R:  -- because you have to -- you -- you don't know if there's going to be a next attack, if it's going to be closer to home.  You know, you have -- and some people just get up and say, "Well, you know, I'm going to go help"... so [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, some -- but sometimes the help isn't helpful.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Th- they're running right into the --
R:  Into the -- 
L:  -- center of things and they don't know what to do.
R:  Yeah.  Ye- I -- I guess, you know, that's -- I guess everybody has their way of reacting to things, and some people just -- that's their reaction, "Well, I'm just going to go help and see if we can, you know, find people with them".  Because that's what happened here.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, at the time it wasn't helpful but, you know, later on as -- as nerves calmed down a little bit and, you know, things started to shed to light, you know, it was helpful, you know.  It was the thought --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that count.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I thought it was really touching -- I'm in California -- it was really touching to watch the people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- lined up around the block to give blood, say, 'cause it was the only thing they could think to do.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and it was so hopeful that there would be someone to take wh- who would need the blood.  Uh -- 
R:  Yeah.  I -- I remember that.  They were lined up around the corner there.  I mean, even as the trucks passed by they were waving signs, you know, they were just bas- -- it was support.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whether you lost someone or not, you know, we're all human, you know, and we all cross each other, whether it's on the trains in the morning, in the deli in the afternoon, you know, we're still people and, you know, like I said, whether it happens here or someplace else, no one deserved that.
L:  No, it's terrible.
R:  Oh, it --
L:  -- terrible --
R:  -- it was a lot of people that we lost so, you know ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was [SIGH] but I -- I'd definitely, I mean, I know for sure, I don't think anybody [LAUGH] is going to sit back and just say, "Okay, well, I am very relaxed".  They have to sort of be -- totally be out of their mind if they re going to sit there and say that.  You know --
L:  Yeah.  Maybe --
R:  -- because -- 
L:  -- some people with some training can do, like, what the people on the, um, on the Pennsylvania planes did --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- try to figure out what's going on.  But most people would --
R:  Right.
L:  -- be so surprised, or don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have the training --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or --
R:  Yeah well, you look at -- that was the expression on a lot of people, you know, a lot of people couldn't believe what was going on.  You know, they were, like, no, you know, I -- even myself, I was on my way to work that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- morning, and I heard it over a dispatch radio 'cause I just so happened --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to take a cab to go to work.
L:  Oh, man!
R:  And, um ... you know, I was, like, "What?" and I called my mom and I was, like, "Mom!"  You know.  I -- I didn't get panicky, panicky, but I was, like, "No, I can't believe that" so, you know, it's --
L:  No, you d- -- you don't want to believe it.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  You know, because, I mean, that's a humongous --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- building --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- with over, you know, three thousand people working in it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, a plane, you know, went into it and, you know, when you see pictures and you see that it's a little bit more reality --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then that's when you start, you know.  And the more you watch the news and the more you see what's going on, you know, you do cry whether you know someone or you don't.  You know, 'cause it -- it --
L:  Oh, I cried and cried.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's part of life, you know, it's part of how us humans work and, you know, that's part of my emotion so ...
L:  Yeah.  I -- I hope I would be like some of the people who tried to figure out what was needed and do it.  That --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess they were -- they weren't calm in a sense of being relaxed, but they were directed.
R:  [MN] Ri- right.  Yeah.
L:  I hope -- I hope I would do that.  Try to get people out or try to do something to improve --
R:  Do something.
L:  -- the situation --
R:  Right.  Just [inaudible] --
L:  -- instead of just panic and --
R:  Right.  Well, definite- -- I mean, it took me -- it took us a couple of days -- ar- -- I didn't -- us meaning me and my family -- took us a couple of days --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know, to say, "Okay, well, we're going to go down and -- and give blood or, you know, we're going to go down and take --" you know, because they were asking for supplies and stuff like that, like workers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for stuff like that.  It's -- because, you know, we didn't wanna [SIGH] -- we didn't wanna come with reality so, no --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, this happens.  So, some sa- -- you know, it -- it all depends on your strength.  If -- if you know that in a time like this, your nerves are going to be shot of course.  You're going to want to cry, of course.  But if you know that you can keep yourself together and, you know, to be strong for someone else, then you can do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because a lot of people did it that day.  And they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- did it for months to come.  Because they real- --
L:  That was really amazing.
R:  Yeah.  Even in November when it was, you know, cold outside -- bricks -- like, we say here in New York, that it was, like, zero below I don't know what and, you know, it was still smoldering.  There was a lot of people who -- they didn't give up. You know, they did what they had to do.  They were there twenty four hours a day, took turns doing shifts, you know, and -- and --
L:  They saw some -- they saw some terrible things too.
R:  Ov- yeah.  I know.  And we're, I mean, New York is going through a process of therapy and rebuilding.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  So, you know, and yo- -- a lot of people, you know, a lot of people would, you know, turn to their religion, turn to their friends, but I don't think that anybody, like I say, whether it's here, you know -- in Oklahoma they sent those -- their you know, their blessings because they knew what it was to be bombed, because they were bombed --
L:  Right.
R:  -- back, you know, back -- not so long ago with that building.  So, you know, it's -- I don't think anybody would just sit down and say, you know, okay well ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it happened, we can't do nothing now.  That's not -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think that's in a reaction that anybody would give. [SIGH]
L:  No.  But I think some people just get so scared they, you know, they cry or they would sit in the middle of a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- walking path or get in the way somehow.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  You know, they will have --
L:  -- panicking.
R:  -- some kind of -- right.  Definitely. They will have some kind of disbelief --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like I said, like, oh, my God, because, you know, that's a big building.  Who would ever think that someone would try to, you know, fly a plane into the building and actually, you know, bring the building down --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, we -- us -- we would think it not possible, bur reality is, it was possible.  So ...
L:  Mhm.  Ye- --
R:  -- I bet that was a lot of people's first impression.
L:  Well, I think they wanted to think it was an accident, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- until they heard the second one or they heard about the other events.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  But they just didn't even --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah because they would.  It was a lot of planes, I mean, you know, w- when I heard it, it was just one plane.  Then as, you know, things started developing -- 'cause, you know, very early in the morning here in New York, we have a whole lot of chemicals outside.  So, very early in the morning, you know, everybody's outside and we -- we see -- we saw the events.  And then --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that's when we heard of, you know, the Pentagon and the other plane that, uh, touched down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- over there by Pennsyl- Pennsylvania field --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then that's when reality started to hit.  You know, like, oh, my God, you know, we were attacked.
L:  Right.  It had to be on purpose, not a coincidence.
R:  Right.  Right.  Definitely.
L:  But if you were right in the middle of things with no radio, no TV -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- all you know is the noise, the fire, you know, people screaming --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, what would you do?
R:  I don't -- whoa.  I would -- I would try -- if there's other people around me -- we -- I would try to just gather us up and try to get to a place that's safer until --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we actually know what happened.  But yeah, there would be some kind of panic, like, "Oh, my God, what happened?  What's going on?"  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause that's very natural, maybe a couple of tears.  I mean, it -- it depends on the person how strong you can hold yourself up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, definitely if I was in a place where I hear, you know, like, a boom or the S.E. fired and there's no TV, no radio, no telephone, no nothing, I would try to get somewhere, you know, where I can keep myself a little bit safe.
L:  Now sim- --
R:  Until I find, you know, find out what's going on.
L:  Mhm.  Right.  Yeah, makes you think some people really have training or pay attention to [COUGH] --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- the fire drills where they work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so- --
R:  Yeah, but, I mean, we go th- -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sometimes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're very careless and it's, like, "Oh, that's just the fire alarm going off" and you really don't pay attention to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think that after the events that happened September, we have a whole lot of nerves that at the slightest thing, everybody's turning their necks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I've been on the train and I've seen the expression on everybody's face if they hear a thump, or, you know, someone comes in with a large suitcase, they're looking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think we're a little more aware now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than before.  I just hope that, you know, the government and the federal wi- -- they're as -- as aware as we are. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, true.  
R:  -- than before, you know, so, you know, they could try to avoid this in the future. But we do- -- I don't -- like I said, nobody deserved this.
L:  No.  Wh- --
R:  -- whether it's here --
L:  -- when you go some place, if you're in a building, do you notice where the fire exits are?  Or think about what the --
R:  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I -- I try to avoid big buildings.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I try -- if it -- if it's past the fifth floor I'm not going.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  You know, 'cause I -- yeah.  I -- I -- it's, like, you know, it's still with me, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't -- I don't want to see, you know -- we were in the street the other -- just the other day and a plane was flying real low, and I -- I -- I started laughing because I knew something was going to happen.  Later on that night there was, like, nine, one, one went crazy with phone calls because there was a plane flying low over Manhattan.
L:  Oh, how funny --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and everybody called in.
R:  Right.  Everybody called because they were, you know, and it was -- it was just the troops coming back.
L:  Right.
R:  And they wanted a, you know, bird's eye view of the city so, you know, and as a --
