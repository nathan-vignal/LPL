R:  Hello?
L:  Hi. [NOISE]
R:  Um, yes, I had just tri- attempted to call to do one of the ten ...
L:  Uh, yeah, I'm your partner.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, 'cause I --
L:  That's okay.
R:  -- I was on hold for a minute and nobody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- came on with the partner.  Okay, um, well, can I ask your name first of all?
L:  Yeah, I'm Mary Anne.
R:  Um, I'm Carol.  Um, I'm calling from Los Angeles, California.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in LA also.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm in the valley area, [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, anyway, uh, the topic was televised criminal trials.  Did you wanna initiate it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or would you prefer I do?  The conversation?
L:  Um, I don't care.  You've done this before, I gather?
R:  Uh, just the first time yesterday.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, well, anyway, um, I'll -- I'll start out by saying, um, my opinion on trials being televised.  I think it's good for the public to be aware of, you know, facts and ongoing things that go on with the trial, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, things like, well, say, the O.J. trial from years ago, I think it almost deemed a person y- you know like in murder trials, that Lacey thing, O.J., it almost --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- shows their guilt a lot of times by the way the media projects things when our justice system is supposed to be innocent till proven guilty and long before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- jurors are even selected, people have a preconceived idea of o- someone's guilt a lot of times by the way the media projects it and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- my opinion, I don't know what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you think about that ...
L:  You think that media frames it in a certain way?
R:  Uh, yeah, in a lot of ways, you know, like, well, the guy with the Lacey thing.  He said he went fishing and then they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have to keep bringing that up when they found the bodies by the water.  Well, he said he went fishing that day and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, very possibly he could've done it and then, who knows, maybe somebody else did.  Um, I'm kind of, you know, I guess ... for somebody having a fair trial as opposed to, you know, a lot of evidence negatively projected against somebody before a trial comes up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, 'cause if I was the person that was being accused of something, you know, I would want it done fairly and probably, you know, just even look at the jail system with all the people they're releasing from prison that got, um, wrongly, you know, convicted and, you know, DNA for rapes and different things because of, you know, maybe jurors bringing back verdicts that, you know, were maybe somewhat influenced by media and [LAUGH] whatnot.
L:  Mm.  Um ... well, I think the media really ... uh, only gets involved in really high profile cases and I think a lot of those cases that were ... [SIGH] um, in Illinois where they ... convicted felons were, uh, pardoned and released, etc. etc.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Most of those cases were not very high profile.  That had more to do with, um ... police and prosecution tampering of evidence.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  Well --
L:  -- in terms of televised, I think that ... again, with the O.J. trial it seems ... incredibly clear in the quarry of public opinion that he was guilty and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yet the re- -- the jury returned the opposite verdict so ...
R:  So, it just --
L:  -- I -- I ... I definitely think the media has some influence but ... I don't know how much it really has.  I think -- I think in some cases it's more of a follower than a leader.  I think sometimes they sort of see ... who's sympathetic, who's not sympathetic and then try to go that way.
R:  Well, I think probably why I have a little unusual of an opinion or, you know, 'cause I -- I agree with you as far as the O.J. thing went.  It did show a lot of evidence weighed, you know, where he could have very well been the person or y- you know, involved with the planning of it or what have you.  But, um, I myself, and this is dating back some years ago, and also some acquaintances I've had over the year, had had some very adverse dealings with L.A.P.D.  You know, them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, fabricating things against either myself or other people and of course, you know, it was all settled through lawyers and what not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything came out in my favor but I do know that the police do do a lot of, you know, underhanded [LAUGH] things.  Or at least w- in LA, you know, and I'd say ... you know, I was very much, um ... [LIPSMACK] moved by the Ferman[?] thing because I, and another lady friend, had had a contact with Ferman maybe ten years before that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where he had attempted to do something, you know, of a dishonest nature.  So, you know, it -- I'm --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- just saying, you know, it's just I guess how you look at the law and the system, depending on what your life experiences have been.  Either yourself or if you've known others that have been wronged, so I'm more to looking at it very open mindedly and not immediately believing police testimony.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, I agree with that.
R:  Um --
L:  Um ... I -- just in terms of, uh, of televising things ... [LIPSMACK] ... uh ... I -- yeah, I -- I'm pretty much against it.  Maybe for slightly different reasons but ... I just think that it turns the ... whole criminal justice sym- system into entertainment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that that's ...
R:  Kinda like a carnival. [LAUGH]
L:  -- not a good idea.  What?
R:  Kind of like a carnival.
L:  Exactly, and, um ... and I know it -- it happened even in the past when it was only newspapers and radio were covering it but ... um ... I think that TV when we're watching something on TV like the -- a trial ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think it sort of gives us the illusion of control or participation and things like that and ... the reality is most people are not participating in ... you know, civic activity.  And ... I think when we sort of pretend that we are in the jury and we're participating and we have control of the outcome it's just sort of a way of -- of, uh, distancing us really from reality from what's really happening.  Like, with ... uh, the example of O.J. and the example you gave of your personal experience, um ... how many people that watched that really went out and got very involved in ... you know, police reform? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, one thing I did do and -- to bring up that since you brought it up, um, I did write a letter and Fedex it to Johnny Cochran explaining a situation I had with Mr. Ferman with all the, you know, documentation to verify what I was saying, and said, "I would be willing if they needed any additional people to show that he wa- had wronged people in, you know, harassment and, you know, false arrest kind of things; false information.  I'd be willing to participate and for no funds" 'cause it just was something that, you know, it's the one and only experience that I ever had in my life of a policeman doing something to arrest me and it was wron- -- a wrongful, you know, arrest.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just because the ... cop was of an [LAUGH] underhanded nature and racist and whatnot.  You know, what had happened -- I'm Caucasian and I had a Latin lady friend in my car and she kind of looked like she could be black.  You know, kind of like -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a Puerto Rican type look, and he pulled us over and, you know, was, you know, saying a lot of racial slurs and I spoke back in defense and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- asking him why he was doing that and he in turn arrested me and put all tor- sorts of false charges on me which, of course, later got ... dropped and whatnot but it was just shocking to me.  Years later you're looking at TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and looking at the same officer -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, that did that and there he was.  It was brought up that he did that in other racial situations.  You know, where black was concerned or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, minority so ...
L:  So, in that sense, would you say it was good that it was televised ...
R:  Um, i- it was --
L:  -- so that more people perhaps would have come -- you know, came forward, um --
R:  Mhm and --
L:  -- talked about their experiences with him, etc?
R:  Or -- or just let's say, um, some child had been molested by a priest when they were having the big, you know, Catholic priest thing.  Maybe more people who were victims would have come forward or if there was, um, some rapist that they had caught and somebody wasn't aware of it that had been a victim of serial rapist.  I mean it can be good in the sense of bringing someone to justice and how 'bout, you know, when they show people that have been kidnapped on TV, what if you had seen that person and you could help a child get back to its parents?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, there's lots of good things as far as, you know, showing criminal -- not just the trials but, you know, criminal activity in general that's going on and we're trying to solve a crime.  I think that's good.  It's just where certain cases are concerned, I think the media does kinda project their idea of guilt or [LAUGH] innocence in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of the things they say --
L:  Th- --
R:  -- prior --
L:  -- the thing -- the thing about this topic is I'm not really sure how many trials have actually been televised.  I mean, everybody knows the O.J. trial, but I don't really ...
R:  What about the lady where her kids were in the lake?  You know, where she drowned her own children?
L:  [inaudible] Smith?  That --
R:  That --
L:  -- was televised?
R:  Um ... I thought it was.  
L:  See, I -- I have no idea.  I don't get Court TV which I think, you know --
R:  And that Lacey one.
L:  -- over the past several years has sold that rule.
R:  The Lacey one is being ... televised.  The, you know, pregnant wife that ...
L:  So, like, if -- when he gets -- when he got arraigned that was on TV? 
R:  Uh, yeah --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- 'cause they keep showing updates and what his --
