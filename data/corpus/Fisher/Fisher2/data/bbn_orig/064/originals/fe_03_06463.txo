L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, this is Rina from Florida.
R:  Anne.
L:  Well --
R:  You said, "Anne"?
L:  And where are you from?
R:  Uh, this is Sue from Illinois.
L:  Sue from Illinois?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, actually, boy [LAUGH] ... uh, that's [NOISE] not true.  Um ... it's, uh -- I know ... Sue from Wisconsin.  [LAUGH] We just moved.
L:  Oh, you just moved from Wisconsin to Illinois?
R:  Uh, the opposite.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  From Illinois to Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, cooler. [LAUGH]
R:  Just over the border so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not a huge move. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  W- ... well, what do you think about the high televised cases?
R:  Well, [SIGH] ... I don't know.  I -- I think that what happens with those is you end up with, um, you know, high profile lawyers and -- and, you know, it kinda gets to be a ... um, more like a TV show, uh, kind of a media circus.  Um [SIGH] ... [LIPSMACK] I really only watch parts, you know, years ago of, um ... the, uh ... O.J. Simpson trial.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that was it.  I -- we've never had Court TV [LAUGH] so I haven't watched anything that way.  How 'bout you?
L:  Oh, we have Court TV and, um ... but it ain't something I have on all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I -- you know, I have seen a couple of the cases and, like, O.J.'s and stuff I did -- you know, I did, uh, k- kinda keep track of that one ... and [COUGH] I think some of these higher profile ones where, uh, media is so much into it that, uh, sometimes you wonder if some of them are able to get a fair trial.
R:  Yeah.  That's the thing.  Um, so many of these people have already been tried ... before they even get to trial.  Um ... and that's -- you know, that's not fair.
L:  No.
R:  Um ...
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But, um --
L:  So, uh --
R:  -- I mean, I -- I do e- -- I -- I like to watch TV shows, you know, that -- that are, you know, involved court cases and -- and especially things like Sixty Minutes and -- and that where they do have it, um, although that kinda chops it up a lot for you, you know.  You're not watching the day to day ... you know, whole thing.  Um --
L:  Well -- right.
R:  -- i- is it interesting to watch?
L:  W- what was that?
R:  Is it interesting to watch or is it kinda ... um ... you know, boring?
L:  Uh, depending -- depending on, uh, the -- for the most part interesting.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Whether --
R:  Who have you seen?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Have you -- h- um, what cases have you -- you seen any- anything ... high profile lately or ...?
L:  Um, not lately I haven't.  Uh ... I haven't seen too many lately.  Um, the -- the latest that I -- it wasn't on, like Court TV or nothing, but just the regular news was -- well, it seems to be high profile is the Scott Peterson case.
R:  Oh yeah.  That's terrible. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, I mean you wonder.  That's how -- you know, where can he go to get a ... fair trial at?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- --
R:  That's a [inaudible].  I don't care if they -- they send him to, you know, within California.  I -- I don't care if they send him to Florida. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Um ... [LAUGH] everybody knows about it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Or you would have to end up in some little rural area that doesn't get TV and then ... [LAUGH] you have to wonder if that's a jury of his peers at that point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  'Cause it's so televised, everything, that even going to a different state --
R:  Right.
L:  -- b- but, you know, you hear of it and ...
R:  It's pretty hard nowadays not to know anything about any of these cases.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Any case, you know?  Um ... y- just even, you know, reading -- um, a- are you on the internet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I mean, it's -- it's almost impossible to, um ... you know, avoid hearing about, you know, everything that happens.
L:  Right.
R:  So ... um ...
L:  Uh ... you --
R:  Yeah --
L:  Are you on [inaudible]?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Real- you know, it's funny, I was just reading yesterday that something talk- ended up talking to somebody [LAUGH] who ... who --
L:  Else was on there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're like, "Cool" you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, here we are.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just got my issue today because it was forwarded. [LAUGH]
L:  I just got mine today too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So, are you a -- a major +couponer or are you just a ... dabbler like me?
L:  Kind of a mediocre ... you know --
R:  Kind of in the middle there?
L:  With time wise, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I never ... [LAUGH] you know, I ... I'm really shocked when I actually cut out coupons and have 'em with me.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm a bad [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm trying to change that though.
L:  [MN] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I mean, everybody right now, with the way the economy is and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm, it's almost impossible to ... you know, mad, um ... I -- I still go back to C.V.S.  It's like a half an hour drive but, you know, I have prescriptions and so you end up with the gift card.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I get a lot of, you know, stuff that way so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but whenever I have a coupon ... you know, it makes it ... more than free. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know, which is --
L:  That's it, yeah.
R:  -- great.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, I might -- I might have -- well, we're going off camping ... uh, for a week and stuff so I can kick back and relax and maybe see some of, uh, the TV and stuff and ... maybe get the -- see what kind of cases that they have. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, honestly, I don't eve- -- I don't know now here if I have Court TV because there's more, um ... [LIPSMACK] you know, more, uh, stations than I had before.  But, uh ... I don't know.  I -- I ... [SIGH] I've always been pretty fascinated with ... you know, with things or, you know, with court cases and that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, at one point, I even ha- -- you know, thought about, "Wow, it would be, you know, cool to be a paralegal or something like that".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that wouldn't a been too bad, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And I've always like to, you know ... [SIGH] not solve mysteries but, you know, kinda like, "Ah, he did it?" you know?  Um --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- I like to -- all the forensic things that they have on TV and so of course any trial that -- that would, uh, have something like that in it ... would interest me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, mayb- maybe I'll see what kinda cases and stuff they have.  I'll have some time to watch some TV. [LAUGH]
R:  That'll be great, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I actually, um ... w- watched a little TV ... this afternoon, um, you know, I been ... trying to unpack boxes and do all [LAUGH] kinds a things and -- and, you know, before with moving there's so many things that you have to do, you know, you're like, "Oh, I -- I -- you know, I really need to do this.  I need to do that" and then ... to actually have enough stuff in place now where I can sit down and watch TV and go, "Wow!" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't have [LAUGH] to do anything else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's nothing hanging over my head.  It's kinda nice for ... [LAUGH] a change.
L:  When they have the O.J. trial and stuff did you ... keep track of it very much or just, you know, what you hear?  I mean --
R:  [SIGH] You know, I watched some of it and pretty much ... uh, you know, you could just follow it in the news.  Every night they would tell you what happened.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Um, I see --
L:  You could almost tell before it ended that they were -- he was gonna get off.
R:  Right.  I mean, I -- and I ... [LIPSMACK] personally, I think that he's guilty as sin ... [SIGH] but, um --
L:  I -- I figure either if he didn't do it himself, he had somebody do it.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  One or the other.
R:  Right.  It was just too mu- -- too much.
L:  Oh, yeah.  "When I get off -- when I get outta here, I'm gonna go find the real killer".  Well --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Rea- real killer must be on, uh -- must be a golfer or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause he's always on the golf course. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, really, he's -- he's really driven to take care of this -- find out what's going on.  Huh!
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  In fact, the night that he led -- led them on the wild goose chase on the freeway ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] but we were at my niece's wedding.  So, I always, like, you know, put the two together.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] I think I was at home watching the chase and I thought it was kinda funny because, you know, usually on your police chases and stuff you have high speeds ...
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- chases and stuff, and he's so -- you know, strolling along.  [LAUGH]
R:  That was really something.  Y- the whole -- that's what I mean, you know, that you get these high profile cases and you get these high profile lawyers and, you know, "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit" and all this kinda stuff that years later you still remember all of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And like I said, it -- it's just kind of a media circus.  Um ... you know, it's like -- w- and of course that's unfortunately true of any case that -- that the better the lawyer, the better he can ... horn- hoodwink or whatever you wanna say, the jury.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, the -- I mean, the guy could -- could be guilty.  They don't ... really care if the guy's guilty.  It's ... you know, unless they're, you know, really, really ethical.  But then they wouldn't be a lawyer.  They could never take a case [LAUGH] where the guy was guilty.
L:  How many -- yeah.  How many of them you find. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we just had a situation with the lawyer.  It seemed to be going well and then we found --
