R:  Hi, I'm Maria and, um -- hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, [LAUGH] I'm Jenie Demaro and I'm in Texas.
R:  Uh-huh, I'm in, uh, California.
L:  [MN] Oh.  Well [LAUGH] I've never done this before.  Have you?  Is that -- are we allowed to [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, it's my, um -- I think it's my last time actually.  Yeah, I have.
L:  Oh.  How come it's your last time?
R:  'Cause it's only three times.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just never have done it and I didn't know how -- what to expect.  Well, if -- what did she say?  Televising criminal court ... things?
R:  What do you -- wha- what's your question?
L:  What did she ask us to talk about?
R:  Um, yeah.  Um, high profile --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- um, like, celebrities?
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they have, um -- yeah, if they're on trial --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- should it be televised or not and then have we ever watched it?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I guess I watched a little of bit of, uh, what is it?  Um, the -- oh, what the -- football player.  How could I forget his name?
R:  O.J. Simpson?
L:  [LAUGH] O.J. Simpson.  Uh --
R:  Yeah, I think everybody has.
L:  [LAUGH] I watched a little of that but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know.  I don't ... if -- if I was an attorney or a pa- -- or a -- or on trial, no, I don't think people should watch it 'cause I --
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Because then you're also under pressure, like, if you're in the jury or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's kind of like you're under public pressure and it shouldn't be that way.
L:  Right, right.  But ... the voyeuristic part of me says, "Oh, yeah, I'd love to see [LAUGH] that".
R:  Yes, the same.  Like, I will watch it too because like let's say if, I don't know, Brittany Spears was on trial or something, I'd probably --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- watch it --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, um, I don't think it's right.
L:  Yeah.  I don't either.  I think it, um ... it would make people afraid to say what they really think.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they were trying to get, um -- get, um, inside the jury room here in Houston to, um --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, they wanted to ...
R:  Which trial was it?
L:  You know, I can't even remember.
R:  Was it a celebrity?
L:  No, no, no.  It was just some high profile here in Houston.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think it involved child abuse but I can't remember for sure and it was just recently and, um, [LIPSMACK] they turned it -- everybody turned it down finally.  They didn't allow the cameras in the jury room.
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  But --
R:  -- good --
L:  But --
R:  -- because it's almost distraction then, you know?
L:  Uh, I don't know.  Well, who would say anything inside a jury room if you knew it was all being televised?  Especially if it was some of these skanky people that might come back later and murder you.
R:  Exactly --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- you're right.  You know what?  I never thought about this part, yes.  It's kind of an endangerment too.
L:  Well, yeah!  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't even wanna be on a regular trial in this day and time because I'd be afraid somebody, even if they weren't around to kill me, that somebody else would come and do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  That sounds terrible.
R:  Yeah, you're right.
L:  That sounds terrible.  I'm not sure about exactly what they intended us to talk about.  [LAUGH] Do they --
R:  Well, it's -- you know, they should be televised or not and that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a good reason --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for it to -- you know, not to be televised.
L:  Yeah.  Um ... do they record this and then they ... uh, grade it or something?  Decide how --
R:  No, they're just gonna, um, do a study on it, like, um, about the way we talk.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, about -- it's not so much about the topic, it's more about the way we talk to each other --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because it's a linguistic study --
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  -- so they're just gonna evaluate this and try to find, like, a pattern, I guess --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- with people talking.  I don't know.  
L:  Oh, I see.  I just --
R:  So, no, they don't grade that.
L:  I just vaguely remember reading it and I could- -- I -- I remember signing up for it but --
R:  But we have to stay on topic otherwise we won't get the ten dollars.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, okay, so what do you think about, um, [LIPSMACK] so, okay, O.J. Simpson I think is the most famous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trial.  Then there was another, um, basketball player in Chicago, I think it was Scotty Pippin --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he, um -- what did he do?  I think he burnt down his girlfriend's house or something like that.
L:  Oh, yeah!  Yeah.  But --
R:  You remember that?
L:  Yeah, but did they televise it?
R:  I don't think so.  The media --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- said a lot -- you know, what I'm thinking of?  You remember R Kelly?  He was involved in, uh, child abuse?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know if you've heard it.
L:  Yeah.  No.  Is it something like --
R:  He's a -- he's an R and B singer.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He's a pretty famous R and B singer and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he was, uh, involved in child abuse --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the media was, like, really covering it.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But I don't think they allowed any cameras or anything in the room --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I remember they always had pictures in the newspaper of him in the courtroom --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but they never actually filmed it.  
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  So, I think it depends on the trial.
L:  Yeah.  Well, here though, they have artists in the courtroom.  I don't know if that's everywhere but --
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's what the same thing they do there too.
L:  Yeah, and to let you know what's going on.  And people are always lined up outside wanting to watch.  Well ...
R:  Oh, remember Winona Ryder when she, uh, committed shoplifting?  
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  I think her ... I don't know.  I saw pictures from the courtroom but I didn't see actually any like -- 
L:  The law and stuff?
R:  -- anything going on, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think what they do is there're so many people out televis- -- or taking pictures of anybody that's any kind of ... you know, newspaper, newsworthy or
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or that people have a [inaudible] interest in that, you know, you -- you forget that you weren't really in the courtroom because you see it on the news every night.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You see so much about them.  You read so much about them.  Um ... [SIGH] and I think that the, um ... O.J. Simpson trial should've taught everybody that that should not be on TV.  Because that just turned --
R:  Well he -- well, his was on TV all the time, right?
L:  Yeah, the whole thing was.  And it just turned into a spectacle.
R:  I know, I know and probably maybe --
L:  It w- --
R:  -- also the decision would've been slightly different, you know, um, if -- if there wouldn't have been so much media involved.
L:  I think it definitely worked to his advantage and he was on stage.
R:  Yes, and I think that the jury might have been afraid of, you know -- I think they preferred letting him go than actually convicting him and then he might not be guilty --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so they kind of like felt pressured I think by everybody watching what they did too.  
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  So, yeah --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- it -- it might have worked out differently.  So -- and then also, well, who else was it that, um, rapper, Sean Combs.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you know who that is?
L:  Well, I've heard of him but I'm -- have to admit I'm probably a little older than you are, girl.  [inaudible] --
R:  No, but, uh -- he was, uh, with Jennifer Lopez.  He was involved in a shooting in a club.  
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
R:  And he shot, um, one -- him or his friend shot one person to, um, that this person still has bullets in her head and they can't remove it and she's paralyzed now.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, his thing was heavily covered by the news and Jennifer Lopez didn't get in trouble for it and he ended up being totally -- they dropped all charges against him and his bodyguard was convicted to, um -- to life so I felt that this wasn't right either because they were both involved in it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and one person gets to go --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the other person goes to jail for life.
L:  Because one's rich and one isn't.
R:  Exactly, that's how I felt too that they used -- you know, that the -- his bodyguard ... so sometimes that -- that makes me really mad, you know?
L:  Were th- -- was it televised?  Did they televise it?
R:  Um, [SIGH] I don't think so.  They always had pictures in the paper --
L:  Uh-huh, [inaudible].
R:  -- but I don't think it was televised, uh-uh.  
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It was also not as big as O.J. Simpson.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I don't know.  It's like everybody wants all this reality stuff now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think that's part of it.  I -- I wouldn't be surprised if that reality TV shows came out of that, you know, because it was so popular to watch the, uh, O.J. Simpson trials.
R:  Yeah.  And they also said that people who were in the jury, if they wrote a book about it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they could become millionaires.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And the lawyers too.
R:  Yes, that's what I heard too.
L:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.  Well --
R:  [NOISE] And they, yeah -- that's -- that's kind of, like, you know -- [NOISE] I don't -- 
L:  Well, not --
R:  -- it just always makes me think that if you would have been a regular guy and the situation --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- would have been the same, he would have probably -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know, got like a life sentence or something.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I know my nephew's an attorney.  He's a criminal attorney.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he says the same thing.  He doesn't want anybody televising, uh, although he said a lot of times it would work to his client's advantage but he still doesn't think it's right.  He doesn't think it's fair.  Um --
R:  Yeah, I don't think so either.  Because it seems that people, um, who don't have that much media exposure, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, get a different kind of justice --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and that's not right.
L:  Yeah.  Well, and not only that.  Mainly I would be worried about that jury ... being on TV and, you know, people not wanting to be a juror for that reason.
R:  Exactly.  That's what they said, that so many people didn't wanna be in the jury because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they were so scared about it.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Uh --
R:  Yes, that's true too.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  And then also, um, it's -- it's kind of like you commit, like, a high profile crime and after that you kind of get famous and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it shouldn't work that way either.  
L:  Oh --
R:  I mean, people shouldn't be on TV because they killed somebody.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's kind of like, you know ...?
L:  Yeah.  Well, if they ever get it to the point where they're gonna let us -- let everybody watch it on TV, I'll bet they'll make some more laws and say you can't make money from it.  The -- the criminals can't make money from it.
R:  Oh, yeah, they should.  That would be right.
L:  But then probably the jurors will.  [LAUGH] And then they'll probably say nobody can make money from it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  What they should do is let, well, this is -- I guess I'm getting off topic.  [LIPSMACK] I started to say they should let 'em make money off of it but let it go to the victims.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Let the money go to the victims.
R:  Remember there was this case.  Now, it was kind of like a high profile case too about this guy who killed his wife?  It's been in the -- in the newspaper lately and --
L:  Yeah, the -- the one that was pregnant?
R:  Yes, and then he dyed his hair blonde or something like that?
L:  Yeah.  Lacey -- Lacey somebody.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I've been reading a lot about that too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, now see, he would probably -- it would be to his advantage to have --
