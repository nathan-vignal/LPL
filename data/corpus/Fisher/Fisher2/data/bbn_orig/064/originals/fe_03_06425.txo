L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My name's Angie.
R:  I'm Corron[?].
L:  Hi, Corron.
R:  [MN]
L:  Where, ah -- where do you live?
R:  I live in New York.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, in New York!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  I know.
L:  This one's hits h- home then?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I live in Fredericksburg, Virginia --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- which is just, um, less than an hour south of Washington DC.
R:  Oh, I know where that is.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, let's see.  I guess you've actually been right in the middle of one.  
R:  Yeah, it was, um --
L:  Um -- 
R:  I actually lost -- um, my boss died in --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- September eleventh. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness!  Was he -- I mean, was y- -- one of your offices there?
R:  Um, actually I had worked for him when I was, um -- it was, like, he- -- 'bout thirteen or fourteen years ago.  And we always kept in contact with each other.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] And, um, like, that particular day it was ... I mean it wa- -- I don't -- I mean, New York was not itself.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was just so upsetting to watch --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- especially, like, being, like, a New York -- living here your whole life.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, [MN] it just, like, it made me want to -- I called him at the office and it w- -- the phone just went dead so, like, I knew something was wrong.
L:  [MN] Argh [inaudible].
R:  And then I called his wife and she couldn't, like, even talk to me because that's [MN] how long, like, we knew each other.
L:  Uh-huh.  That you were that close to 'em.
R:  So, um, but it was just really devastating to watch.
L:  Oh, my goodness!  Now, I -- I guess -- did you see a lot of panicking going on?  I mean, how far away were you?
R:  Um, [COUGH] I -- right now -- I'm originally from Nurashell[?], which, um, outside of the city --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is like about f- forty m- -- 'bout a half hour --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to forty minutes.  And then -- but right when that happened I was about two hour- -- [MN] well, about an hour and a half away --
L:  Away.
R:  -- two hours.  But it was, um, [LIPSMACK] it was weird because everyone had their, uh, if they were in the car, no one was listening to any music and you would go into the supermarket and that's all they had on the television screens and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people were, like, so afraid that they were just, like, buying everything in sight.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, really.  Right at that point, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it was, like, really, like, scary and, [COUGH] um, my sister was in the heart of everything because she works in Manhattan --
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  -- so, like, she couldn't even get home so they had to evacuate all of New York City so, everyone, like, had to walk ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- and, um, --
L:  Ah, did she, I mean, did you guys get in touch --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with her at least?
R:  Um, she called because her office is across the street from Grand Central terminal --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- but then, um, after they bombed the twin towers, they were threatening to bomb Grand Central terminal so --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- everyone was, like -- my sister called me up here; she was hysterical crying because she didn't know how she was going to get home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, uh, she ended up not going home that night and staying, like, at a friend's house I guess in the city.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, it was so devastating.  Really, I mean, everyone was afraid.  I -- my husband works for the railroad, for Metro North --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, like, I didn't hear for hi- -- from him for, like, hours.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  So it was really, um, -- and my brother in law was, um, [LIPSMACK] one of the police officers that, um, went down to the site but thank God, like, nothing happened to him.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] So, it was, um, overall [SIGH] very, um, [LIPSMACK] a very upsetting day.  [MN]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, yeah.  I -- I actually worked for the Department of Navy and so we were at --
R:  Oh, God!
L:  -- a navy base that's about probably forty five, fifty miles from DC --
R:  Oh, my!
L:  -- and my husband called me and s- -- and when the plane -- the first plane flew in and I'm like, "What are you talking about?  We -- I'm sitting here in the b- -- the head of the office [LAUGH] of the navy base [LAUGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- and we haven't, you know, heard anything yet".  And I guess it was within minutes they had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- had it on -- on TV or something.  And then, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, the -- the second one hit and so we evacuated, but I was lucky that, um, I was in the front office --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I got the news really early and could go ahead and leave and come home.  And, um, you know, people were backed up in there for, like four and five hours --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- just getting off the base.  But, ah, of course at that time, all the rumors were going on, like, I do have friends that work at the Pentagon, and, um, I did work in DC for a couple of years, like, right before that I'd just left DC a couple of months bo- --like, six months before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, they were talking about car bombs and stuff right around the State Department, which is next to the building that I worked in.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  So, I was really worried about my friends and I just had a baby in th- that April before --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, ah, my mom was home watching her and I was just, y- you know, [MN] it was just awful.
R:  I know.
L:  Just not knowing what's coming next and just, you know, once -- once I guess I was home right -- right after the first tower fell.  And just seeing all that just -- I don't know it -- it, uh, it is really scary.  And, ah --
R:  I know he, um -- I mean, you hope so because you obviously you're not there so you don't really know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- other than what people are telling you and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] they just [SIGH] -- he was, like, the type of person, like, he wouldn't even kill a fly, like, literally.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, [LAUGH] he was just, like, so in- -- such a nice person.  And, um, he was trying to help -- he wasn't worried about himself, he was trying to help other people get out.
L:  Where was he in the building?
R:  He was on the -- he worked for -- on the hundred and third floor.
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  And, um, he got down to the seventy -- [LIPSMACK] I think it was the seventy sixth floor, and that's when they hit the second tower so, the whole building that he was in, like, shook.  So, it threw all these people [MN] --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- and when he landed, he broke his arm and both his legs so, he couldn't, like, walk.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  So, um, he just fell with the building.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um --
L:  And of course you've got people that are kind of recounting what happened --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it's [inaudible] ...
R:  One women like [NOISE] that was right near him, um, [LIPSMACK] likes, I guess told what happened and, uh ... but now I keep in touch with [SIGH] his brother believe it or not.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I became, like, the best of friends with him --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and he works for Cape Canaveral --
L:  Argh!
R:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] we correspond back and forth.  We email each other and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, I guess ...
L:  Um, [MN] I guess another thing along the lines of terrorism, of course we had the sniper attacks --
R:  That's right. 
L:  -- um, back in October and it was -- it was totally a different scenario but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it w- -- it -- it just showed how easily that if Al Qaeda or any, you know, other terrorist group wanted to, they could shut down cities across the nation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with doing that.  'Cause, I mean, [MN] the terrorist attack -- I mean, the sniper attacked two places within five miles of my home.  And --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- I was -- the first time it hit Fredericks- -- you know, he w- -- they where in Fredericksburg, um, was in a Michael[?] store and I think, um, the attack happened at two thirty and I was there at eleven thirty with my daughter in the same row that the car was parked in --
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  -- and I just c- -- and after it happened, you know, I could just still +envision myself; like seeing me put my daughter in and then being at the back of the car and lifting the tilt[?], you know, the, um, [LIPSMACK] putting the stroller in.  And just in the same position that this woman was in, um, she was one of the survivors.  And then the second one happened at a, um, the gas station where of course it was, ah -- it had been going on for about three weeks at that time.  And you do get to a point where, you know, I can understand, like, in Israel and the places that have car bombs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and bu- buses that get bombed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, you know, how do people live?  Or how do you go out?  You get to the point where you have to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you're just, like, "I can't -- I can't stay in any more".  So, I was, like, "I'm going towards Richmond, ah, Virginia.  I've got to get gas".  I mean, we were -- we were driving to the mountains to get gas -- my husband would --
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  -- in the weekends, just so that we wouldn't go to a gas station.  And I'm, like, "No, I'm going to pick up my mom.  We're going to visit people in Richmond".  And I was tying my shoelaces -- I'd already put my -- shoes on my kids and my sister in law called me and said, you know, "Somebody was just killed at that Exon" and that's where I was headed.
R:  Oh, God!
L:  Like, within five minutes I would --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- have been there.  And, you know, that just shows you it just ... and everybody around here has a story like that, you know, that in some way they're connected with one of them or something that happened.  But how --
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  -- how scary it is, is when it could be you and just, you know, like, in your situation whee you had such a close friend that, um --
R:  I know.  It's just I can't believe we're going to ever -- ever going to talk to him again.  And it's, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so upsetting but I don't know it's, [SIGH] um, I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they're having, um, a really, um, they're on high alert this weekend.
L:  Right.  You know, I just --
R:  So, it's scary.
L:  It -- it is and y- -- and I -- I guess I've -- I've read in the paper and saw a little bit on television about the, um, [LIPSMACK] the messages that I've come across and stuff and, you know, it can happen any time.  Do you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have, um, oh, like the duct tape and all that kind of stuff they talked about for a bioterrorism, um --
R:  No -- no I have duct tape but I don't -- to be honest with you I don't realy know how to use -- [LAUGH] how to use any of that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, 'cause I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the type of person I'll, like, panic.
L:  You are the person that'll panic?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I can't -- I'm not, like, calm in, like, that kind of a situation.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Uh, what about you?
L:  Um, you know, we d- -- we d- -- of course they have -- they put it out many times and I never worried about it and then I really have since September eleventh I c- -- um, probably every other time I go to the grocery store I'll just grab a bottle of water, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a gallon jug of water.  So, I've gotten, um, you know, more of a supply of that stuff  'cause I guess I start --
