L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, hello, my name is Brenda.
L:  Hi, Brenda.  My name is Barbara.
R:  Well, [SIGH] I don't know a whole lot of this about the topic, uh -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I [SIGH] -- seen course some of 'em.  The famous O.J. trial.  Didn't watch all of that.  Got -- I got --
L:  Did you watch some of it?
R:  -- sick of that real fast but -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I watched some of it.  Um ... I don't know.  I have -- uh, [SIGH] think about -- what do you think about [LAUGH]?
L:  Well, I -- I kinda think it's not a good idea.  Everybody gets their two cents in and they are not really there.  And I just wonder what's the point of having a jury.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I -- I kind of tend to agree.  I think it's, um ... [SIGH] in a way it seems like the ... lawyers and -- and everybody kind of ... [SIGH] play to the camera, you know?
L:  Yes, I think so too.
R:  I- it -- it's like their -- it's as -- their -- this is their big moment or something, you know?  They're -- instead of concentrating, as you say, on the trial.  It's like they're -- they're all concentrating on -- on looking good for the media and everything it seems like.
L:  Yeah.  And I think too, what if I was a -- a witness.  You know, not the guilty person. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But a witness.  I wouldn't wanna be on television. 
R:  No, that's true.  Some of those trials -- I mean, I'd be kinda scared just to -- just to be a witness.
L:  That's true. [LAUGH]
R:  Let alone ... you know, thank God the whole world is watching.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's -- that's really true.  And then the families of the ... well, the -- the one on trial but the families of the victims.  I --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- just ... seems like it would not be a ... good idea to subject them to all that.
L:  No, 'cause they're already going through so much.
R:  That's true.  Where do you live, Barbara?
L:  Well, I live in Sacramento, California.  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Allens[?], Tennessee.  We're about halfway between Nashville and Knoxville.
L:  Ah!  Well, I'm not at all familiar with that area but I'm really pleased to get someone from not in my area. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I live in a very rural ... area.  Um ... uh, the -- the little town we live in [SIGH] ... is -- oh, goodness, probably has ... mm, four to five thousand people.
L:  Oh, how nice!
R:  Um --
L:  Do you like that?
R:  Yes.  It's -- well, I grew up in a rural area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I really enjoy it.  We're not -- we're a hundred miles from Nashville so it's -- life's not that far. [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  But, uh ... [SIGH] we still have bad things happen in small towns. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, well.  
R:  A- --
L:  That's a shame.
R:  -- and, uh [SIGH] as far as the tele- -- the, you know, the -- it's not really televised like, you know, we had a ... he was valedictorian of his senior class in my daughter's graduating class a few years ago and ... uh, I guess a couple of years out of high school he came back home and murdered his ... let's see, murdered his mother and ... injured his stepfather or father I guess it was.  Um --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  So, like, course that wasn't televised, uh, but the media really, you know, had a field day with it and, of course, being a small area, it was in -- in our next biggest town, Livingston, which probably has, eh, maybe eight thousand, nine thousand people in it, so you know, and of course most of these towns everybody knows everybody [LAUGH] else.
L:  Mhm.  Well, so, since we're supposed to talk about being televised, why do you think they did not televise it?
R:  Uh, this one here?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Probably bec- it is such a small area.  Um, we do have local television stations but [inaudible].  The one we get on cable out here never has anything on it but just some advertising on -- oh, I guess they, uh, they televise the, uh ... graduations and stuff like that but ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they really don't, uh ... don't do a whole lot and I don't -- as far as I know ... none of the other, like, national stations or any of them picked it up.
L:  Oh, 'cause they think it's just not interesting to enough people I guess.
R:  Probably.
L:  Uh!
R:  Probably.  Too much going on. [LAUGH]
L:  See, there you go again. [LAUGH]
R:  Too much going on in Nashville to worry about up here.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's good for you.
R:  True.  That's true.
L:  Well, we live near -- uh, Sacramento is sort of near Modesto which is where -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Lacy Peterson ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I don't know if that's in the news out your way?
R:  Yes.  Oh, yes.
L:  I- it's on television all the time here.  In, uh --
R:  That's gotta be so hard on her family. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  And I'm assuming the trial will be on television too.
R:  Oh, i- probably.  I hadn't heard anything ... [SIGH] really.  Um ... one way or the other lately but ... it probably will be.
L:  Yeah.  No.
R:  So ...
L:  They give us so long to talk about something that ... [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, i- --
L:  -- doesn't take very much time.
R:  I -- I know one of the ones I ha- -- I got to talk about was -- was food and I thought, "Well, I can talk on that for a long time". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And one was family.  Um ... this was kind of a ... a hard one to ... to get into I thought.
L:  This is sort of like, nope, I don't think it's a good idea.  [LAUGH] And there you are. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  As long as we're [SIGH] talking and getting paid for it I guess it's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  This is really a pretty fun thing to do.
R:  It is.  It is.  I'm enjoying it.  I've not -- I, uh -- uh, well, I guess this is about the third or forth interview I've done.  The conversation one I've done ... with people but I'd never done one like this before.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do mystery shopping.
L:  You do?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What does that involve?
R:  Uh, well, it can be a lot of different things.  I haven't been doing it very long; about three or four months.  I have done evaluations for ... fast food, like McDonald's and Arby's.  I've done retail shops, Belks[?].  I've done Riteaid and, um, um, let me think ... [SIGH] Yamaha, um ... I've done a -- an exit interview at Lowes and ... Plat- -- it's called Platform shops at a couple of banks.  Mainly, i- -- mainly you go in and the -- the place that you're evaluating is not supposed to know that you're evaluating them.  That's why they call it a mystery ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- shopper.  So, uh, you have certain criteria, certain questions or whatever that you're -- you're lo- -- things you're looking for and -- and all of mine that I've done I just -- I fill out their forms on line.  Some of 'em are just a reimbursement.  Like, we got ... free tickets -- meal tickets for Logans Roadhouse for dinner one night.  Um, they sent the -- uh, sent us the meal tickets so we could each -- my husband and I each got a free meal and appetizer and -- and our drinks.
L:  Well, that's fun.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it was neat and some of 'em ... some of 'em I've spent ... ten minutes and got paid twenty bucks and some of 'em I've spent ... an hour and got paid eight bucks so ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, I guess it evens out?
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  Well, now, do you go to places in your local area or do you go out of town?
R:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] ... many of them are in Livingston which is like just three and a half miles from us which is that small city.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And Coaxville[?] which is about twenty five miles from us, that has about -- probably thirty thousand people in it.  So, it's a -- it's a bigger area.  Then I got to Nashville a lot so I do do some in Nashville and some ... on the way.  [LAUGH] And around there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, it's kinda fun.
L:  Well, yeah, and I was thinking though that if you just stayed in your own area, people would know you were coming.
R:  Well, I mean, you shop those places anyway a lot so y- -- many times so --
L:  Oh, so they never find out?
R:  They really don't know.  I mean, you just -- you go in and ... you have to surreptitiously record times and ... faces and all that.  I mean, names and descriptions.  Some of them are really picky.  Like, McDonald's; twenty two pages of stuff to fill out for McDonald's.
L:  You're kidding?
R:  No!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Is it worth it?
R:  [SIGH] I'm -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, sometimes.  If they can't -- I usually wait on McDonald's 'cause they usually have bonus 'cause they -- they have a hard time getting people. [LAUGH]
L:  No wonder.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Anyway, uh, so the last McDonald's I did was just in Livingston, like, three and a half miles from here and I got paid -- the- -- they pay an hour.  You usually spend ... ah, twenty minutes in -- in the store or in the restaurant.  They pay seven forty four an hour, then I got paid ... um ... I got reimbursed for the food I bought and I got paid a fifteen dollar bonus, so it wasn't too bad.  I mean --
L:  Not at all.
R:  -- still have to spend the time filling out all that stuff but ...
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  I have never known a mystery shopper.
R:  Well, you have now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's kinda fun.
L:  Yeah, it sounds like it.  Makes me wanna do it in fact. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] But as far as this, um, [SIGH] televising the ... criminal -- I -- I --
