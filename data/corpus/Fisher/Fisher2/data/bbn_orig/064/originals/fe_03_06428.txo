R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [LAUGH] Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Ann.
R:  Ah, this is Carol.
L:  Hi Carol.  How are you?
R:  Okay.  Um, [LAUGH] I guess we're supposed to talk about, uh, what, terrorists?
L:  Yeah.  Terrorism and I guess how -- how we think that people would react if there's a terrorist attack.
R:  Um, they would probably panic.  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I think that depending on what area you're in, you know.  I'm in New York City.
R:  Argh!  I -- I would --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I would panic there.  So, um ...
L:  A lot of people, you know, would panic but I think people would know how to, um, to handle themselves also.
R:  No.  I don't think they would.
L:  No?
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Not after nine eleven, you don't think so?
R:  Well, I don't think, ah, that we're used to that in the United States.  I don't think we're used to, ah, [PAUSE] threats like that so much.  So, I --  
L:  No.
R:  -- I think they -- they may not.  Well, some might.
L:  See I -- the only reason I say that is because everyone was simply, you know, here I -- I live right in Manhattan so, everyone, you know, have -- already went through that.
R:  Ah, that's true.
L:  So, that's the only reason I say that.  Um, majority, I would say yes.  
R:  Uh.
L:  Everyone would panic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, going [several inaudible words] before and you learn things, like, you know, people learn things after the -- the whole fact of the matter happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But unfortunately it is -- it is realistic. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, unfortunately it is.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] the airports would probably, I don't know, close down and --
L:  Oh, yeah.   Oh, yeah.
R:  Argh, it's --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- I think it's pretty hard for them to, um, have that much security anywhere.  I mean, you can only have so much security.
L:  Y- you can only do so much.  But right now, I mean, w- -- a- -- everywhere you walk there's a cop in New York.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  We have, um, four or five army men in -- underground in the subways --
R:  Ooh!
L:  We have people, um, [LIPSMACK] that are in undercover.  At the bridges and tunnels you have trucks being pulled over at random and searched.
R:  Really?
L:  So, yeah.  Well, you know, everyone just got moved so, we got moved -- everyone got moved to the high orange alert, right?
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  But we've been on high orange alert since the whole thing back with, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- okay a couple of months ago there was a threat to New York, you know, with -- with the whole thing with the, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everyone's buying the masking tape and the plastic and stuff like that.
R:  Ooh!
L:  So, we never went back from the -- from -- we've been in orange +since then.
R:  Argh.
L:  So ...
R:  Well [SIGH] --
L:  It's scary; it really is.
R:  Yeah, I -- yes.  Especially if --
L:  Well, what --
R:  -- you've went through it, um. --
L:  -- but what can you do though?  I mean, you can't stop working.  You can't stop going --
R:  No.
L:  -- to school.  You have to go on with your life because that's what they want, you know.
R:  Yeah, that is what they want.  They want to immobilize everyone.
L:  Yep.  Yep.  And they sure have hit the economy, that's for sure.
R:  Uh, yeah.  That's not good either.
L:  No. 
R:  But, uh, [SIGH] I think all you can do is just continue on and ...
L:  You c- -- that's all you can do.  I mean, y- you can't [MN] uh, let's face it, we can't stop a damn thing.
R:  No.
L:  As one person -- as a -- a -- I mean, you know, the government may be able to do.  But as me, no, I can't do anything.
R:  No.
L:  What's going to happen is going to happen.  All I can do is, you know, like, being in New York, I gotta be careful when I'm out.  I gotta be aware of my surroundings, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- people leave strange packages and stuff.  We even have, um, [MN] sensors down in the sub- -- down in the subways --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and it measures the air.  And if the air changes it alerts the, um --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- a team to come and check it out.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  So, yeah.  So it's scary but at the same time they're taking major precautions, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we have helicopters --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- flying over the city, everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Uh-huh.  It might help to really watch the immigrants that comes in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Very much so.  Because you have people, you know --
R:  Really check 'em.
L:  -- these people that are -- that are doing this don't care if they die, you know --
R:  No, they don't
L:  -- they're [inaudible] --
R:  That's what's worse.  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  Because they're suicide bombers. They don't care, you know.
R:  No.  
L:  [LIPSMACK] But --
L:  So, the immigrants is what I would really [LAUGH] -- I would really watch.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 'Cause you just can't tell --
L:  And they always seem to slip through the cracks some way -- somehow.  That's the unfortunate thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Even through Mexico way.
L:  That's -- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's amazing though, you think -- you would think there would be some way that they really [NOISE] would [several inaudible words] especially right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Personally I -- I -- like I said, I mean, we can- can't do anything.
R:  Uh, no.
L:  I don't know how I would handle it, you know --
R:  Ooh, go- -- 
L:  It's be- --
R:  I would worry about the children too you know --
L:  Right, because --
R:  -- if you have children.
L:  -- exactly.
R:  Because [MN] --
L:  Children and then you have parents that are killed and that their --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- children are not killed and they have no parents -- oh, God!  It is -- oh, it -- it's horrible.
R:  It is but we can't just sit around and worry about it, but we do have to think about it.  I mean, I --
L:  We -- we have to be realistic and -- and keep our eyes out because, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it could happen anywhere.  It really -- I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- then and you've got all these shootings and everything in the colleges.  I mean, it's happening a lot more
R:  I know.  I don't understand why --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- all of a sudden though -- well, maybe it's not all of a sudden, but I don't know why, ah, this has started, or what the reasoning is.  I mean, they just out of the blue decided, ah, just take over.
L:  It's gotten a lot worse.  It has.
R:  I wonder why though.
L:  [MN] I don't know.
R:  [MN] [SIGH]
L:  I think it ha- -- uh, not that it has a lot -- I think some of the -- th- there's a lot of animosity towards, Bush, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I definitely think there is.  And the way he handles himself in the foreign countries.  There really is a lot of animosity.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] No.
L:  But, I mean, unfortunately we have to do what we have to do but there are ways -- things -- to say things, you know, he doesn't need to be [LAUGH] and in -- oh, anyway he does definitely does not [inaudible] need to get us deeper than we already are.  That's the way I feel.
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  I don't know if the war has helped it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- here too much but [SIGH] it hasn't hurt anything I guess.
L:  No, it hasn't.  But I don't see where it's helped either really.
R:  Well, it's helped --
L:  Over there, yes.  I guess we're not seeing it too, you know, it's hard --
R:  I don't think you --
L:  -- to judge.
R:  -- I don't think you could see it immediately.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I don't think it's something that -- it would take time to see the results --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I believe.
L:  And we don't -- and we're not even, you know, what we see is on the news.  We don't see it in person either, you know, so things --
R:  No.
L:  -- could be happening --
R:  Yeah.  You don't know everything over the news.
L:  Exactly.  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I -- and we really shouldn't know everything over the news, you know, they should--
L:  Oh, yeah because then you have people leaking in and finding out stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think they -- they [MN] this last, you know, this last little bit where they did the war and stuff televised for Christ sake, live, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I don't know --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- I don't know if that was good or not to be honest with you.
R:  Yeah.  Is it -- doing it over the TV ... you mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.
L:  An- -- it -- you had, I mean, you have people com- -- ge- -- staying up twenty four hours a day watching the news.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have kids -- you think about the kids sit down, they get intrigued by this stuff, you know, little kids.  They're --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and th- -- you got kids in there sitting down and watching the TV, the parent maybe at work or in the other room cooking dinner --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- parent wouldn't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I don't think it was good to have it on as much as they did.
L:  What did it do?  What did it really do?  It didn't help us.
R:  No.
L:  I guess it kept us informed, but what can we do again?  We were helpless as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as a one person.  As a human being you were helpless. [LAUGH]
R:  And it probably caused a lot of unnecessary fe- fear too.
L:  Oh, fear --
R:  Especially in kids.
L:  -- and anxiety, depression, the lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it was -- it was really bad.  Because I know a parent, you know, they were talking about it on the news in the morning how people were, like, "Oh, if y- you have more than this happening, you should go see a doctor" and stuff because --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a lot of people were suffering from depression.  But hello --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that would be a key to turn it off, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people ...
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's not good for security either I don't think, to just sit there and tell everything they can about it.
L:  That's right!  That's what I'm saying.  'Cause you know they break through stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that they're getting into this information 'cause if they're telling us so much, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably know more than what they're telling us, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the people who break into it.
R:  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And at what point is it really relevant to us?
R:  It isn't.
L:  We can much better find out, you know, after, you know.
R:  Yeah.  When it's all said and done
L:  You don't need to be seeing the bombing being done live.  I mean --
R:  No.
L:  -- that -- you --
R:  No.
L:  -- don't need to.
R:  No.  Especially --
L:  But ...
R:  -- someone that, uh, has relatives over there they could see a relative, you know.
L:  Oh, God, yeah!  Anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, you know, you're just from there and you just knew the area, you know, that -- you -- imagine seeing your city blown up?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just the land itself.  Nothing else.  No people or nothing.  I mean, that's a favorite place you grew up your whole life, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Your house.  I mean, just, ooh, the devastation! 
R:  I- it's not necessary.
L:  No.  I would agree. I definitely would agree.
R:  Hm.
L:  How many times have you done this before?
R:  This is the first time.
L:  Oh, this is your first time?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  I've done it a couple of times.
R:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  It's strange.
L:  It is.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I done even know how I -- and to be honest with ya, I don't even know how they r- --
