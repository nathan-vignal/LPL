R:  Hello, this is Sharon.
L:  How are you?
R:  All right.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  How do you think you would react?
R:  Well ... [LIPSMACK] I think the, uh, criminal trials ... like -- especially like with the, uh, Lesley Peterson case and things like that ... I believe there's i- hundreds if not, you know, thousands of murders within a week in the US.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when the media jumps on something like that ... they blow it all outta proportion and they really do affect the way people feel about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean ... l- we can look at the riots in LA ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as an example.
L:  Right.
R:  I think a lot of people just took advantage of the fact that there was a reason to ... destroy and make mayhem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it was so ... wildly televised, the Rodney King incident.
L:  Right.
R:  And I believe the OJ Simpson trial, the way it was aired it became a soap opera.  It wasn't a trial.
L:  Yeah, it was quite theatrical.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] it was ... I don't know.  It was crazy.
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, well, you know, I think that ... it's so big as far as terrorism is concerned and in this country we are not, um ... [LIPSMACK] we are not taught so much where our safe places are, where our shelters are.  We don't have those type of drills and other countries really do, so it makes the people more proactive.  Here I think we would be more scared because even let's say if the procedures that they put in place don't work because there's only so much you can do --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- with a bomb.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  I mean, there's only ... yeah, as far as that goes, yeah, there's only so much you can do.
L:  But it still makes tremendous difference if the people are proactive ... you know, as far as whether they'll be organized in what they're doing, whether there'll be total chaos.  
R:  Well --
L:  If people feel they have a reason, if people feel that there is something they can do, no matter how gigantic the task is, you'd be surprised the hurdles you can overcome.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I realize that.  I mean, I'm from the south and ... 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- really, I mean ... i- people around here ... just, you know, if -- if there's a real problem, you know, we come together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and that's just always been the way it is.
L:  I think that the people will come together but I think that ... it'll be aft- -- it'll be when things have calmed after something has exploded, after -- you see what I'm saying?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  And we'll be looking back on it --
R:  Yeah, there is a --
L:  -- saying, "Hindsight is twenty, twenty vision if we could have A, B or C".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You see what I'm saying?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But when you make it -- when you televise and you make a country proactive and you show them that there are things they can do, it's -- it's really almost no matter what it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I'm saying because you're fighting something that's so humongous. 
R:  Yeah, y- w- ...
L:  But regardless, you'll find that the people will step into line and you'll have less of that looking back and saying, "Oh, this is what could have been A.  This is what could have been B".  You know?  And --
R:  Yeah, w- --
L:  -- y- you'll -- you'll cut a lot of that fear --
R:  So -- so --
L:  -- factor.
R:  So, you're saying that the more we ... I don't know, more or less listen to ... um ... are involved in what the government says?
L:  Well, not even so much --
R:  The less we're gonna know in the long run?
L:  Right.  I just think that w- we'll never know.  I mean that --
R:  Ye- y- well, I know.
L:  -- that -- that -- that's --
R:  Oh, I know that.  I understand that.
L:  You know?  So, w- we'll take that into consideration but with the fact that we will never know.  With the fact that we will never truly understand what goes on behind closed doors, with taking all of that into account and saying, "You know what?  With all of that, this is what we can do.  We have shelters on Forty Fifth Street.  We have food lines here.  We have this there".  Even -- I mean, I'm not saying I certainly wouldn't want it not to be true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we're -- we're way beyond that.  We're way beyond that, but with that t- taken into account and having this be a general thing, having this be something that's televised it makes you so that it cuts that fear factor and it gets the people in a more organized mood.  That way you don't get in the, "Oh my God, oh my God" and everybody running for themselves and -- you see?
R:  Yeah.  I understand.  Taking sides, more or less.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And maybe they're taking the wrong side.  Y- --
L:  Yeah, that's very possible.
R:  You know?
L:  That's very possible.
R:  I mean, they don't understand what's going on so therefore ... there's, uh --
L:  Do you feel that you'd be scared?
R:  Huh?
L:  Do you feel that you'd be scared or panic?
R:  Not really.
L:  Really?  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, really?  No.  I mean ... [SIGH] I mean, I -- I was -- I was scared ... like on nine eleven.  I was, um -- I work night shift and, uh --
L:  Where're you from?
R:  I'm from ... Hatteysburgh, Mississippi. 
L:  Okay.
R:  On nine eleven I ... I worked night shift and I was asleep whenever it started happening.  My mother told me, you know.  I'd just lost my dad about ... probably two years before that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We were in a car accident.  And, um ... my mom woke me up and said, "Whoa, they just hit the, uh, Pentagon and the World Trade Center".
L:  Yeah?
R:  And it was kinda one of those things of, "Okay, I'll get up in a few minutes" you know?  But once I -- you know, I went back to sleep but I thought about what she had said.  And, my God, I got up and watched it and ... I swear I -- I cried like a baby.
L:  Oh, I -- I mean, New York is my home, so yeah.
R:  Y- you know, I mean, it -- it was ... it was so frightening and ... I really don't think we've done enough.
L:  No, I -- I -- I, um ...
R:  I think we -- we m- -- we may have done some of the wrong things and --
L:  But you know, in New York you get so complacent.  You know, you have the crime level is higher.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Incidents like that hap- --
R:  I'm from New Orleans actually.
L:  Okay, incidents like that happen so often that you begin to think -- what's amazing is how we went so back norm as if it didn't happen at all.
R:  Yeah, I know they -- that -- that bugs the hell outta me.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But what else can you do?
R:  You know, the -- the people --
L:  You don't wanna sit in sorrow.  You --
R:  Pe- --
L:  -- don't wanna sit in sorrow.
R:  Yeah, well, you don't wanna sit in sorrow but you don't wanna quit thinking about something and just eliminate it.
L:  But if you -- if you really --
R:  If you eliminate something from your mind --
L:  -- thought about that --
R:  -- it's gonna come back one day.
L:  That's true.  That's true, and you wanna --
R:  You know?
L:  -- get therapy but if you kept your mind into thinking about that, you'd hate the world.
R:  I -- well, definitely, yes.  You can't --
L:  You know?
R:  -- have that attitude about it.
L:  So, I think they did the best that they could and said, "Well, we won't continue thinking about it".  You know, when I walk down the street remember what was ... and when I walk down the street and remember half my coworkers are gone.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah, but in a way the ... you gotta look at it like this.  If they quit thinking like that and they quit pushing the government ... you know, to do what's right and to end ... this situation in our country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I mean, i- not really trying to sound hateful, but no matter what it takes ... until we do th- --
L:  Well, what it would have taken.  What --
R:  Until we do that the -- they will -- there will continue to be incidents that happen.
L:  Right, but what if -- would have taken?  Was -- it wasn't so much their fault.  Not saying that ... they should ever get away, but if we would have had the correct procedures in place, it would've never happened and they got in so easily ...
R:  Whoa --
L:  I mean, beyond easily.  Beyond easily.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes.
L:  So, I almost feel like --
R:  Yes, we -- we should --
L:  -- I mean, I certainly don't condone anything --
R:  -- control our borders better.
L:  But that's all it would've taken.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  That's all it would've taken.
R:  We should control our borders better.
L:  But Americans have that --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- savior complex.  They're gonna save the world.  We feel so sorry for the other people and they're in and they're watching us every day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  They're clocking our --
R:  Oh, definitely yeah.
L:  -- they're clocking our every move.  And, you know, Americans, you know, all we just wanna give to the people, you know?  We give enough.  Charity starts at home.
R:  That's right, yeah.
L:  You know?  So, let's start --
R:  Well, that's right.  That's right.  Clinton and the, uh ... uh, millions if not billions he gave Arafat while he was in office.
L:  Right.
R:  And you know, I mean, once you come to a point where you're just paying off basically -- you're paying off a terrorist organization by not only giving them money but ... affirming them as a government.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then you're running into problems there to g- --
