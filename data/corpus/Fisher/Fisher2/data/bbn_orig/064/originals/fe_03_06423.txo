R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name is Phillip.
L:  My name is Gina.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you, Gina.
L:  You too.
R:  I think this is gonna be, uh, an interesting ten minutes 'cause there's not a lot of -- to work with.  It's a pretty fake topic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Where -- where are you from?
L:  I'm in Arkansas.  Where are you?
R:  Uh, I'm up in, uh, Philadelphia.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh, have you done one of these before?
L:  One.  How 'bout you?
R:  Uh, I did two.  I did one about -- a little over a month ago and then I did one last night, which was, uh, a little bit better, uh, but still ...  What -- what was your previous topic?
L:  Um, computer games.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Computer games?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  I don't know.  Are you a big computer person?
L:  No, not really.
R:  Yeah.  So, that was probably a struggle, right?  [LAUGH]  Um, I mean, so -- so terrorism, would -- would you remain calm during a terrorist attack?
L:  Well, that's pretty obvious.  Not many people would.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I don't -- I don't -- yeah, I -- I have to agree with you there, um [LIPSMACK], I mean, I guess, uh -- I guess it depends, uh, how close I was, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to -- to the -- to the thing.  I know that -- that on nine eleven, you know, even though New York was -- was pretty close to Philadelphia it's -- it's far enough away that, you know, I -- I was more like kind of not -- not really in fear as much as just in shock of -- of what was going on.  Um, so, I don't -- I don't -- I don't say that I would -- that I panicked, but I guess -- I guess if I were closer to -- to where it was going on, like if it was actually affecting me, then -- then I'd be a lot more panicked.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [PAUSE] Uh, I don't know.  Did you, uh -- did you feel, uh, panicked during nine eleven?
L:  [LIPSMACK] No.  I mean, I was worried that they might do something closer to us, but ...
R:  Really?  I don't think -- I don't think anyone really cares about Arkansas though, to tell you the truth, enough -- 
L:  True.
R:  -- enough for it be --
L:  I mean, that's true.
R:  -- under terrorist attack.  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- but, you know, everywhere you are they're gonna say, "Well, they're gonna hit this place, they're gonna hit this place" --
R:  Right.  Right.  Sure.
L:  -- and, uh, there's a place where they, um, burn off the chemicals --
R:  Oh, yeah, yes.
L: -- a chemical warehouse.
R:  That's a likely target.
L:  So, that's ...
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah.  So, they were saying, you know, "They're gonna hit that" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then we have the Phoenix plant out here that make rockets and things.
R:  Oh, oh, that's true.  Yeah, well, that -- that's definitely I guess a -- a worrisome place.  Um, yeah, I don't know.  What -- what was the, uh, follow up to that question?  Something about what would you do or something?
L:  [PAUSE] Um, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um ...
L:  Like, you say, it depends on where --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- where it was and what they did.
R:  Yeah, exac- I guess so.  Um, I don't know.  I guess -- I guess if, uh -- if it looked like, um, you know, it was unsafe to remain in the area then I guess [NOISE] I would get out [LAUGH] -- get out of the area.  Um, but, uh, I don't know.  Um [LIPSMACK], I guess I'd, uh, try to get in touch with, uh, family members.
L:  Yeah.  They were telling, you know, before, um, all these things you needed to do, like have a plan if you couldn't meet back home --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- where you -- where you would meet your family members in case you couldn't phone them or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's scary to think about that kinda stuff though if it did happen.
R:  No, absolutely.  I agree, um [LIPSMACK], quite scary.  Um, uh, I don't know.  You think -- do you think that a terrorist is likely for it -- it to happen in the U.S., or do you think that it's, uh -- it's -- with all the security measures that we're a lot safer now?
L:  I think -- I think there is still terrorists here for sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't you?
R:  So ...  Yeah, no, I do.  Why -- why don't you think that they've struck again though?
L:  I don't know.  I -- I don't know the answer to that.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  Unless ...
R:  -- it -- it seems like it's still -- even with all the security measures they're taken it still seems like it's pretty easy for someone who wanted to -- you know, who didn't mind, you know, killing themselves in the course of their action to -- to get -- to pull something off.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, sometimes you sit back and think well, they could be waiting to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do something really big --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, you know -- but you're hoping maybe they're -- they're scared to do it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah.  Well, I mean, I think -- I think it's just -- it's, uh -- it's a big time when people are willing to -- to risk their -- 'cause I think -- I think to pull something off without risking your own life is pretty -- it's pretty hard to do.
L:  Right.
R:  But if you don't care that much, if you think that, you know, your mother for doing whatever, uh, if you're willing -- if you're willing to sacrifice your own life, then I feel that, um [LIPSMACK] -- I feel that, uh, it's pretty easy to get away with something.  I don't know.
L:  [PAUSE] And then people that'll just blow their self up to --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- in order to kill others that's -- that's crazy.
R:  I know.  That's because they ...
L:  I -- I don't see how their brain works like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No.  Well, I mean, I guess they just don't -- they don't place, uh, a high value on -- on their current lives and I guess some people feel religiously that they'll -- they'll be rewarded after -- after they die, uh, you know?  They'll -- they'll get rewarded.  So, they -- they feel that, uh, you know, it's more important to make sacrifices now for them to -- to be rewarded afterwards.  But I think, um -- you know, I think that's a real problem from lack of -- lack of good education, you know?
L:  [PAUSE] [MN]
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh, yeah, I don't -- I don't -- I don't know.  It's, uh -- it's a tough problem because it's -- it's difficult to be able to react to that because you don't know exactly who your enemies are, you know?  Like, I think -- I think before the whole terrorist thing, you know, people had to worry about certain countries, but at least -- at least you know who you were dealing with, you know, and if you wanted to -- if a country did something then you knew who to attack, you know, or you -- you went after their army or whatever and their -- their, you know, big spots of power and tried to take out the leaders.  But with terrorism, you know, they dress up as civilians and you -- you don't really know who your enemies are, you know?  They -- 'cause they -- they look like everyone else.  Um, so it's -- it's a big problem trying to figure out who -- who exactly your enemy is if it's not a -- if it's not a country, which you can identify with but, you know, a group of people it's very hard to react 'cause it's hard to find a specific group of people and with having a -- a large number of civilian casualties you really don't know how to get -- get after a certain group of people.
L:  [PAUSE] [MN]
R:  Well, what do you -- what do you think of, um -- of like profiling people, like say at the airport rather than stopping, you know, seventy year old ladies that, you know, can't possibly be terrorists and instead concentrating on those people that seem to have the most likelihood of -- of -- of committing a terrorist attack?  Do you think that's reasonable, or do you think that that's just -- it's too unfair to -- to target specific people?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Um, well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I guess a seventy year old lady is not likely to be if -- but if they got to thinking that the only person who could get away with anything was her --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then they might have her doing it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I suppose -- I suppose that's true.  Um, so you think -- you think basically by -- by selecting certain people out, uh, if there's special -- special attention you think that that would not really be -- be effective because then they'll just, uh -- they'll just, you know --
L:  Well ...
R:  -- figure out other people to do it?
L:  I'm sure now that there's some they, you know, pull aside and really check --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more than they do the others.  But I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know if they just -- how do they do that?  Do they just do a random check or ...?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, every time I go to the airport, you know, the people that -- you know, the people that are stopped, uh, are -- it's pretty random.  I've seen, you know, little tiny children, you know, who they're having to take off their shoes and belts and like all this other stuff, this whole procedure, you know, little tiny kids, you know, um, they're spending all their time checking them and then they don't have -- have time to -- to go after people which seem to be a lot more likely.  But I guess, you know -- I guess, you know, other people can do it too.  I mean, if you look at the Oklahoma City bombing, you know, that was pulled off by -- by an American, a white -- a white blonde American.  So, I guess --
