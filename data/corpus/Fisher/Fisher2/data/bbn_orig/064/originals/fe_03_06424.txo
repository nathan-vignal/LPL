L:  Hello.
R:  Ann.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello, my name's Ann.
L:  Hi, th- this is Kathy.
R:  Hi --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well I guess the topic today is, um --
R:  Terrorism.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Exactly 
R:  Well, I was, uh, down near the World Trade Center on nine eleven [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh, gracious!
R:  -- I saw first hand how people handled terrorism.
L:  Well, I think I would be very panicked.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, I was, um, on Wall Street, seventy five Wall Street at the time, which is approximately eight blocks from the, uh, World Trade Center.  And it was before nine o'clock in the morning; I was sitting at my desk and I hear my coworkers saying to me that, uh, they think there's a ticker tape parade [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, gracious!
R:  -- outside because all these papers were falling around and, um, [NOISE] so, you know, when we looked outside and we saw the papers flying around and, um, you know, it was then we noticed that they were singed.  And then somebody else down the floor had said to us that a plane had [NOISE] hit the World Trade Center.
L:  Oh, gracious!
R:  And, uh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] so then we, uh -- I worked for a, uh, foreign bank at the time -- so we went down to the trading floor 'cause the windows that were there faced, uh, the World Trade Center to go look at it and, um -- I mean, I would have to say I think most people would stay, you know, actually stay pretty calm considering what, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what's happening.  So, you know, we went down, I was looking at the building -- as a matter of fact I used to work in that building at one time --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- I was there for three and a half years from nineteen ninety four to nineteen ninety seven [NOISE] and, um, you know --
L:  Probably very thankful that you weren't still in the building at that time.
R:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH] Oh, I, you know, I guess, you know, things happen for a reason.
L:  Yes.
R:  And [NOISE] you know ...
L:  Do you still live in New York City?
R:  Ah, no.  Actually I live out in New Jersey.  [NOISE]  
L:  Oh!
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Indiana.  
R:  Oh!  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, we're quite a way from you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but I have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- been to New York and I was in the World Trade Center at one time but ...
R:  Yes.  Oh, [inaudible] [NOISE] it was a nice place, you know, it had, uh, a lot of activities going on all the time.  It really -- I think it really brought a lot of uplift to the city.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, it -- it was a great place to work, really was.  And especially in the summer they always had, uh, entertainment outside and everything and, um, and, you know, a lot of vendors.  I remember every Tuesday and Thursday a lot of farmers from upstate New York, New Jersey, even Pennsylvania -- even some of the +farmers from Pennsylvania used to come out with their, um -- with their harvest [LAUGH] and, you know, sell their produce and everything -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, and they also used to sell some baked goods, especially meearmish[?] and, you know, it was a nice, uh, nice happy area.
L:  So, now at ground zero do they have, um, a public -- I mean, is, like -- have they made it a park or is it just more of a tourist -- where people go and --
R:  Loads of, uh, loads of tourists every day go to see it.  They have plaques up with all the names of the people who lost their lives there.  And, uh, I mean, fortunately I didn't lose anybody close to me.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  You know, or in my family but, um, you know, there was one -- one, uh, man who had went through my high school and I was pretty good friends with his, uh, cousin there for a while, who lost his life in there.  He was a fireman.
L:  Oh, gracious!
R:  Yes.  And, uh, [COUGH] you know, very sad but, um, I mean, I would say, you know, on that face things got, you know, people yeah, I would say panicked the most that they would have panicked, when the other building was hit because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- by that time we knew, you know, it wasn't an accident.  The first plane everybody was calling an accident.
L:  Right.
R:  Although it was still, you know, pretty terrifying it was, you know, it wasn't looked at as an attack, you know.  But then when the second building was hit I, um, I was back at my desk at that time and I was on the phone with my husband. He was watching it live on television --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he -- and he told me another -- another plane just hit the other building.  And of course I didn't believe him but then when, you know, I hung up with him and then my boss, like, called the, uh, you know, who was the head of a legal department and he had just told me get out.  He said, "Just get the rest of the group and -- and get out of the building".
L:  Wow!
R:  So, we all went downstairs and, you know, of course there was pandemonium, I mean, I had never seen more traffic jams, and more people around, and more confusion in my life.  [COUGH]
L:   I can imag- -- I just --
R:  You know --
L:  -- to me, you would want to be calm because you would hope that you could help someone or -- or whatever.  But when you see all of that, I think I would have a real hard time remaining calm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- enough to -- and it -- that's probably what creates the traffic jams and people --
R:  What really hit me the worst was when the building started to collapse.
L:  Yes.
R:  Because, you know, at that point wh- what happened was me and a few of my coworkers actually walked closer to the buildings and we actually got within three blocks from them.  And you couldn't get any closer than that 'cause everything was real soft already.
L:  Oh, jeeze!
R:  And I just remember the, you know, tower two was the one that -- that collapsed first and that one was on a slant already.  So, I just looked at that and I said, "Oh, my God" 'cause it was -- it was like, to me it was ten times worse than the other building.
L:  Oh, my!
R:  You know, that -- that was my -- my expression.  And my boss took one look at that and he just turned around and said. "Just go home".  Seems like we're not going to be going back into our buildings today, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I remember, you know, walking away and I made it down to Water Street and, um, I actually had met somebody -- just somebody, like, kinda panicking [LAUGH] behind me saying, "I have to get to the Staten Island ferry.  Where's the Staten Island ferry?" so -- 
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  -- [LAUGH] I turned round and said to her, "Well, I'm going there so just follow me". [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, goodness!
R:  And she -- she had told me that she was in tower two and, uh, fortunately she didn't get to go upstairs.  She said she was, like, down, um, we had the train[?] [several inaudible words] we're off and sh- she just remembers hearing -- hearing a very loud noise and the building shaking and people were screaming.  And the people were saying get out.  So, she wasn't even upstairs, she just, you know, ran out of the building and that's -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- and she ended up by me.  [LAUGH] And, um, so, I remember we were walking toward the Staten Island ferry and we just see people running and they were saying -- and they were crying, and they were saying the building collapsed.
L:  Oh, gracious!  I -- I watched it on television.  My boss --
R:  I have said to myself, you know, I couldn't, like, even imagine it collapsing, you know.  And I didn't even hear anything because it was so loud anyway down there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with all the sirens and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, with all the panic and, um -- 
L:  And --
R:  -- I do believe though that most people stayed pretty calm believe it or not.  I mean, you did see some people crying but I would say the majority kinda stayed calm.
L:  Well, and --
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
L:  -- sometimes something else kicks in I think during times like that.  The pandemonium or whatever you -- there's another part of you that just kicks in and takes over and helps you to remain that way.  And then when you get home after it's -- you know you're safe and your family's okay, then that's when most people I think tend to fall apart or --
R:  [inaudible] Yeah.
L:  -- I know I would.
R:  Actually, you know, it's kind of strange what happens to me.  Like, I came home that day and, I mean, I felt kind of edgy and, you know, I think mostly shocked more than anything.
L:  Right.
R:  And then three days later I actually cried about the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I actually just sat down and cried and, uh, you know.
L:  It was kind of a delayed reaction to it.
R:  [inaudible] yeah.
L:  Do you still work in --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- a high rise building?
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  The building that I worked in at that time was on, uh, Wall and Water Street and I was on the thirty fourth floor.  [COUGH]
L:  Ooh!
R:  And, um, but then after nine eleven, I mean, I didn't -- I wasn't able to get back to my building till about almost two weeks later because there was, like, no water and no electricity down there for a while.
L:  Oh, gr- -- yeah.
R:  As a matter of fact the, uh, following Monday when the stock exchange reopened, it reopened on generators.
L:  Wow!
R:  It didn't even have electricity.  Yeah.
L:  Course it started falling pretty fast at that point too.
R:  So, yeah.  And then, I mean, my -- my company wasn't doing too well at that time and then after nine eleven it just, like, kind of sank down and I didn't, like, go for my job now since last year.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  So, [LAUGH] you know, but, um, you know, I'm presently unemployed but, um --
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] 
R:  -- but better be getting back to work soon because the unemployment doesn't last forever.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  I can imagine.  But, uh, you plan on going back into the city to, uh, ...
R:  I -- I don't know.  I don't know.  I live out in central Jersey and, um, there really isn't much of a need for me to go back there now as there was, you know, before.
L:  Right.
R:  Before, I had to go -- before I had to work in the city to make the salary and everything.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, our f- -- our financial situation's a little bit better so there really isn't much of a need for me to go back so, [MN] back into the city [MN] so, I don't know if I am going to go or --
L:  [inaudible] --
