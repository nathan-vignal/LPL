L:  Hello, my name is Martha.
R:  Hi, this is, Chris.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Hi, can you hear me?
L:  I can hear you fine.  Can you hear me?
R:  Oh, good, yeah, I can hear you now.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm outside though -- it's kind of hard.
R:  It's really storming here so I was concerned [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Both the same.  Okay, what do you think about terrorism?  Do you think we should -- we could stay calm?
R:  Um, probably more so now than we could of two years ago.
L:  Because of September eleven?
R:  Yeah.  You know, I think at that time, everybody would have panicked.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because we'd never experienced anything like that before.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But now, I think -- well, I still think a lot of people would panic.  But I think, you know, now we've been sort of given some ideas of what we can do to prepare for it and all these kinds of things, so we might be a little more calm.
L:  'Cause I --
R:  I don't know, what do you think?
L:  -- I think we -- I -- I personally would panic, because even after September eleven, I don't think we're still any safer.  And because of all the -- even the precautions or the safety test they've given us, I don't see them as being very helpful [PAUSE] still.
R:  Yeah, I don't think we're any safer either, really --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to be honest with you [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] But -- 
R:  But I also feel like, I don't know, maybe I'm just getting desensitized to it, but I feel, like, you know, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen.  And I can only do A, B and C, that I've been told to do, and there's anything else I can do.
L:  Correct.  I mean, I'm still going on with my life but I think I -- the first impact or impression I think I would panic.  But then try to calm myself down.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I probably would too you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- everybody probably would.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  I think -- go ahead.
R:  -- almost any kind of a disaster, that's what you do.
L:  Exactly.
R:  At first, I mean, whether it's a hurricane or a tornado or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- first you panic and then you try to calm yourself down.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Hopefully --
L:  Because I --
R:  -- I mean.
L:  -- yeah because I really don't feel like we are -- we're any safer than we were before.  Yeah, we weren't -- we weren't like a threat before until what?  Pearl Harbor before but even that, you know, it's so far away that we really -- we weren't concerned with it.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, as of September eleven, we're more aware of it, but I don't think we're any safer or -- or we're more concerned with it, at least from California because it's still kinda far away.  You know, y- you were -- y- you felt sympathy, but the same time I don't think you experienced what they did.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure that's true.  What part of the country are you in?
L:  California.
R:  Oh, you are in California.  I'm in Florida.
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
R:  And so, you know, I guess here, the terrorist alert is always high.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's never lowered.
L:  Really.  Co- --
R:  And it's in the papers all the time and it's, you know, it doesn't make you feel any more secure or whatever.  But [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  Because the duct tape, putting it on your windows and the plastic really doesn't help me any [LAUGH].
R:  No. [LAUGH] Well, that doesn't help me any either.
L:  You know, and it may- maybe because we're so, I mean, yeah, you felt sympathy for New Yorkers and for Washington, and you know, Philadelphia.   But at the same time it's still a little bit far away.  It's not here, necessarily.
R:  Right.  See, but it is here.
L:  It is and it's not.  You know?
R:  It is because we had the anthrax thing here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it is because a lot of those terrorists that were involved in nine eleven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they were out of terrorist cells that originated in Florida.
L:  Really!  Well the -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fly in thing, right?
R:  What?
L:  The -- where they -- they trained in Florida for the fly in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if I'm correct.  Yeah, I mean --
R:  Yeah, you know, so for us, you know, I could drive down the street and drive by the motel they stayed in.
L:  Uh-huh, okay.
R:  And it seems closer to me.
L:  Yeah.  This -- 
R:  Than what I'm sure it does to you.
L:  In some way, I mean, I also will panic because my husband is in the military [LAUGH].
R:  Ooh.
L:  So in that aspect I -- I would panic because I'm con- sort of would  --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- have to be sent away, and when will he be back, if he's back.
R:  Yeah, I would really panic then [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  I'm sure I would panic now because, you know, anything like that is a shock and, I mean, you can tell somebody for ever and ever, what to do in the case of an emergency.  But when it actually happens --
L:  Exactly.  It's like with the earthquakes, y- you -- you -- you know what to do, you're prepared, but when it happens, it's always, you know, a shock.
R:  Yep.  Or like, same with hurricanes.
L:  Exactly [LAUGH].
R:  You know, they tell us all the time what to do, how to prepare, when to evacuate.  But when that palm tree comes through your window, you panic.
L:  I think it's h- -- it's just human nature to panic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even -- whether it's terror- -- I mean, I think terrorism would be more, but whether it's terrorism or a natural event, or if anything that would happen in your life, that would just serve it -- it's just natural to panic at first.
R:  Yeah.  You know, and I -- I'm sure that that's part of what --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- terrorism feeds on is that they know what human nature is.
L:  Yes.
R:  They know human nature is to panic and to be afraid, and so that's what they play on.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, you know, I all -- sort of think like you said, it is human nature.  I don't think there's anything we can do about having that reaction.
L:  Yeah.  We can control it afterwards I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And go about our daily lives, but the first instinct would be to panic.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sure it would.  I'm not even sure that, you know, our law enforcement people wouldn't somewhat panic.
L:  I think --
R:  Bec- --
L:  -- they would but they're strong in the fact that they can't show it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, they're all saying that they don't have a lot more tools to deal with it now than they did in nine eleven.
L:  Exactly.  So, that -- that scares me when our police [inaudible] officers and our firemen are not prepared to deal with a situation like that.  That makes me panic more [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- than the terrorists.
R:  That's true.
L:  Because they're --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] and in --
R:  I mean, in -- and maybe they have to control their panic but, you know, they're still a little bit panicked I would think.
L:  And, you know, and they're humans and -- and they have families as well and, you know, you want everybody to be prepared but in Southern California, with such a big population, [PAUSE] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they're not ready then, you know, who else [LAUGH] would --
R:  Just think of the money it would cost, I mean, how much it costs for them to be ready [LAUGH].
L:  That's true, I mean, are we willing to spend the money now?
R:  Well, I would hope so, but I guess you never know [LAUGH].
L:  That's true.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But I don't know about -- I -- I've sort of listened to that question at first and I though well, gee, that's kind of a weird question because [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it just kind of goes back to human nature I guess and --
L:  I think so.  I think I would react afterwards -- it's -- if you could control that aspect of it.
R:  Yeah.  And I think too, how you react to it, like you said, might depend how close it is to you.
L:  Yeah.  Because I mean, w- -- I -- I -- I saw everything on the news, like, with September eleven and I mean, I was really, um, in shock, and I really couldn't feel anything for a while [PAUSE] until --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- afterwards with the whole thing that happened.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know, so I really didn't -- or I mean, I wasn't panicked but I --
R:  Were you at home when that happened?
L:  Yeah.  I was ready to go to school and I just saw it --
R:  But did you stay home?
L:  No.  I went on my day [LAUGH] --
R:  Did you?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they --
R:  Argh.
L:  -- closed the school down and everything.  But I just -- I really didn't know how to react because I didn't know beforehand, you know, what you're supposed to do because the -- the issue really wasn't brought up before.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they came on the TV here and said if you possibly can, you should stay home.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  You know, until we figure out what's going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, I mean --
L:  I mean it --
R:  -- but -- 
L:  -- everything was deserted once I came back from school.  And nobody was on the street, valley was completely shut down.  Everything -- everything.  You know, which was the w- once in a lifetime experience but I just didn't know how to cope with it, I guess would be the correct word.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But I didn't panic, I was just numb.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess.
L:  I don't know.  See it's a strange reaction, but I know with my husband, he was very strong and he said everything's going to be okay, you know.  But also --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- back on -- on whether you do try to put a strong front or --
R:  I'm sorry, what?
L:  -- it -- I guess it all depends on -- you try to put like, a strong front so people don't panic around you, so therefore you're going to be okay.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Because I know my husband's like that even, you know.  And then with him having to go over to Iraq or having to go to Afghanistan, he was very, you know, nothing's going to happen, it's going to be fine [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Wow!
L:  Wanted to go [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] How does he do that? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] He was ready to go.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  And not panicked at all?
L:  I think he was underneath, but he wasn't showing that.
R:  Ooh!
L:  You know, I -- I think he was trying to be brave about it.
R:  Yeah.  I suppose.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know, I can't imagine that, but I suppose the i- I guess they're trained to do that.
L:  Yeah.  And it's -- it's like you said, it's his duty to do it and that's why he's in the military.  So, even if -- he really doesn't have a choice so, he has t- --
R:  Yeah.  I guess that's true.  And I guess, you know, when we have to deal with disasters, whether it's terrorism or something else, we don't have a choice either.
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's probably why after we panic, we calm down.
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  Because, you know, you know that you have to deal with it.  You don't have a choice.
L:  Exactly.  When it -- once it happens, there's nothing --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- else you could do.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you can't pretend it didn't happen, [PAUSE] I guess.
L:  Oh, e- no you can't.  It -- I mean, it's li- it was so big you can't, you know --
R:  Yeah.
