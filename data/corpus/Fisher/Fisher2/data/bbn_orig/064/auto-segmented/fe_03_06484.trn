WHAT DO YOU WHA- WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION  (fe_03_06484-B-0006)
UM YEAH UM HIGH PROFILE UM LIKE CELEBRITIES  (fe_03_06484-B-0007)
IF THEY HAVE UM YEAH IF THEY'RE ON TRIAL SHOULD IT BE TELEVISED OR NOT AND THEN HAVE WE EVER WATCHED IT  (fe_03_06484-B-0008)
O. J. SIMPSON  (fe_03_06484-B-0009)

YEAH  (fe_03_06484-B-0011)

BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE ALSO UNDER PRESSURE LIKE IF YOU'RE IN THE JURY OR SOMETHING IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU'RE UNDER PUBLIC PRESSURE AND IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY  (fe_03_06484-B-0013)
YES THE SAME LIKE I WILL WATCH IT TOO BECAUSE LIKE LET'S SAY IF I DON'T KNOW BRITTANY SPEARS WAS ON TRIAL OR SOMETHING I'D PROBABLY WATCH IT  (fe_03_06484-B-0014)
BUT UM I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_06484-B-0015)

OH REALLY  (fe_03_06484-B-0017)

OH THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST DISTRACTION THEN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06484-B-0021)
EXACTLY YOU'RE RIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS PART YES IT'S KIND OF AN ENDANGERMENT TOO  (fe_03_06484-B-0022)
YEAH  (fe_03_06484-B-0023)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_06484-B-0024)
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT  (fe_03_06484-B-0025)
WELL IT'S YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE TELEVISED OR NOT AND THAT'S A GOOD REASON FOR IT TO YOU KNOW NOT TO BE TELEVISED  (fe_03_06484-B-0026)
NO THEY'RE JUST GONNA UM DO A STUDY ON IT LIKE UM ABOUT THE WAY WE TALK  (fe_03_06484-B-0027)
LIKE ABOUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE TOPIC IT'S MORE ABOUT THE WAY WE TALK TO EACH OTHER  (fe_03_06484-B-0028)
BECAUSE IT'S A LINGUISTIC STUDY SO THEY'RE JUST GONNA EVALUATE THIS AND TRY TO FIND LIKE A PATTERN I GUESS WITH PEOPLE TALKING I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06484-B-0029)
SO NO THEY DON'T GRADE THAT BUT  (fe_03_06484-B-0030)
WE HAVE TO STAY ON TOPIC OTHERWISE WE WON'T GET THE TEN DOLLARS  (fe_03_06484-B-0031)
SO UM OKAY SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT UM [LIPSMACK] SO OKAY O. J. SIMPSON I THINK IS THE MOST FAMOUS  (fe_03_06484-B-0032)
TRIAL THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER UM  (fe_03_06484-B-0033)
BASKETBALL PLAYER IN CHICAGO I THINK IT WAS SCOTTY PIPPIN  (fe_03_06484-B-0034)
AND HE UM WHAT DID HE DO I THINK HE BURNT DOWN HIS GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06484-B-0035)
I DON'T THINK SO THE MEDIA SAID A LOT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING OF YOU REMEMBER R. KELLY HE WAS INVOLVED IN UH CHILD ABUSE  (fe_03_06484-B-0037)
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD IT  (fe_03_06484-B-0038)
HE'S A HE'S AN R. AND B. SINGER  (fe_03_06484-B-0039)
HE'S A PRETTY FAMOUS R. AND B. SINGER AND HE WAS UH INVOLVED IN CHILD ABUSE  (fe_03_06484-B-0040)
AND THE MEDIA WAS LIKE REALLY COVERING IT [LIPSMACK] BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ALLOWED ANY CAMERAS OR ANYTHING IN THE ROOM  (fe_03_06484-B-0041)
BECAUSE I REMEMBER THEY ALWAYS HAD PICTURES IN THE NEWSPAPER OF HIM IN THE COURTROOM  (fe_03_06484-B-0042)
BUT THEY NEVER ACTUALLY FILMED IT SO I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE TRIAL  (fe_03_06484-B-0043)
YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE SAME THING THEY DO THERE TOO  (fe_03_06484-B-0044)
OH REMEMBER WINONA RYDER WHEN SHE UH COMMITTED SHOPLIFTING  (fe_03_06484-B-0045)
I THINK HER  (fe_03_06484-B-0046)
I DON'T KNOW I SAW PICTURES FROM THE COURTROOM BUT I DIDN'T SEE ACTUALLY ANY LIKE ANYTHING GOING ON YEAH  (fe_03_06484-B-0047)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06484-B-0048)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_06484-B-0049)
WELL HE WELL HIS WAS ON T._V. ALL THE TIME RIGHT  (fe_03_06484-B-0050)
I KNOW I KNOW AND PROBABLY MAYBE ALSO THE DECISION WOULD'VE BEEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW UM IF IF THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MEDIA INVOLVED  (fe_03_06484-B-0051)
YES AND I THINK THAT THE JURY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06484-B-0052)
I THINK THEY PREFERRED LETTING HIM GO THAN ACTUALLY CONVICTING HIM AND THEN HE MIGHT NOT BE GUILTY  (fe_03_06484-B-0053)
SO THEY KIND OF LIKE FELT PRESSURED I THINK BY EVERYBODY WATCHING WHAT THEY DID TOO  (fe_03_06484-B-0054)
SO YEAH IT IT MIGHT HAVE WORKED OUT DIFFERENTLY  (fe_03_06484-B-0055)
SO  (fe_03_06484-B-0056)
AND THEN ALSO WELL WHO ELSE WAS IT THAT UM RAPPER SEAN COMBS DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS  (fe_03_06484-B-0057)
NO BUT UH HE WAS UH WITH JENNIFER LOPEZ HE WAS INVOLVED IN A SHOOTING IN A CLUB  (fe_03_06484-B-0058)
AND HE SHOT UM ONE HIM OR HIS FRIEND SHOT ONE PERSON TO UM THAT THIS PERSON STILL HAS BULLETS IN HER HEAD AND THEY CAN'T REMOVE IT AND SHE'S PARALYZED NOW  (fe_03_06484-B-0059)
AND UM HIS THING WAS HEAVILY COVERED BY THE NEWS AND JENNIFER LOPEZ DIDN'T GET IN TROUBLE FOR IT  (fe_03_06484-B-0060)
AND HE ENDED UP BEING TOTALLY THEY DROPPED ALL CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND HIS BODYGUARD WAS CONVICTED TO UM TO LIFE  (fe_03_06484-B-0061)
SO I FELT THAT THIS WASN'T RIGHT EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE BOTH INVOLVED IN IT AND ONE PERSON GETS TO GO AND THE OTHER PERSON GOES TO JAIL FOR LIFE  (fe_03_06484-B-0062)
EXACTLY THAT'S HOW I FELT TOO THAT THEY USED YOU KNOW THAT THE HIS BODYGUARD  (fe_03_06484-B-0063)
SO SOMETIMES THAT THAT MAKES ME REALLY MAD YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06484-B-0064)
UM  (fe_03_06484-B-0065)
[SIGH] I DON'T THINK SO THEY ALWAYS HAD PICTURES IN THE PAPER  (fe_03_06484-B-0066)
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS TELEVISED UH-UH  (fe_03_06484-B-0067)
IT WAS ALSO NOT AS BIG AS O. J. SIMPSON  (fe_03_06484-B-0068)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06484-B-0069)
YEAH AND THEY ALSO SAID THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE JURY IF THEY WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT THEY COULD BECOME MILLIONAIRES  (fe_03_06484-B-0070)

GOT LIKE A LIFE SENTENCE OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_06484-B-0074)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06484-B-0075)
YEAH I DON'T THINK SO EITHER BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE UM WHO DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MEDIA EXPOSURE UM YOU KNOW GET A DIFFERENT KIND OF JUSTICE [LAUGHTER] AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT  (fe_03_06484-B-0076)
EXACTLY THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID THAT SO MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T WANNA BE IN THE JURY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SCARED ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06484-B-0077)
YES THAT'S TRUE TOO  (fe_03_06484-B-0078)
AND THEN ALSO UM IT'S IT'S KIND OF LIKE  (fe_03_06484-B-0079)
YOU COMMIT LIKE A HIGH PROFILE CRIME AND AFTER THAT YOU KIND OF GET FAMOUS AND IT SHOULDN'T WORK THAT WAY EITHER I MEAN PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE ON T._V. BECAUSE THEY KILLED SOMEBODY THAT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06484-B-0080)
OH YEAH THEY SHOULD THAT WOULD BE RIGHT  (fe_03_06484-B-0081)
