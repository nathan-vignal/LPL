BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WERE TO GIVE EASY ACCESS TO ANY TERRORISM THEY COULD BOMB THE THE DAM AND THEN FL- IN ESSENCE FLOOD SACRAMENTO  (fe_03_06426-A-0028)

I WOULD THINK SO I'M I AM TRYING TO IMAGINE  (fe_03_06426-B-0004)
FOR EXAMPLE IF A BUILDING FELL ON TOP OF ME EVEN IF I WERE STILL ALIVE I THINK I WOULD BE EXTREMELY CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND I WOULD PROBABLY BE  (fe_03_06426-B-0005)
