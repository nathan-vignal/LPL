NO YOU KNOW THE ONLY ONES THAT COME TO MIND ARE LIKE O. J. AND THE UH  (fe_03_06471-A-0005)
WHO WERE THE WHO WERE THE TWO BROTHERS OUT IN CALIFORNIA WHO KILLED THEIR PARENTS  (fe_03_06471-A-0006)

MHM  (fe_03_06471-A-0013)
WELL LIKE THE LACEY PETERSON TRIAL NOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT HAS BEEN SO PUBLICIZED IN THE MEDIA UP TO THIS POINT THAT IT WOULD BE KIND OF A SHAME FOR THE PUBLIC NOT TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE  (fe_03_06471-A-0014)
AND YOU KNOW LIKE WITH THE O. J. TRIAL I WISHED I HAD SEEN MORE OF THAT TRIAL BECAUSE WHEN THEY CAME BACK WITH THE VERDICT YOU KNOW I WAS PUZZLED IT'S LIKE HOW COULD THOSE PEOPLE HAVE MADE THAT DECISION  (fe_03_06471-A-0015)
WELL YEAH YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE YOU SAID WE WE READ THE PART THAT SOME REPORTER DEEMS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO GIVE US ON T._V. OR GIVE US IN THE NEWSPAPER  (fe_03_06471-A-0016)
AND WE DON'T SEE AND HEAR EVERYTHING THAT THE JURY HEARD AND SAW AND YOU KNOW THAT I GUESS THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE TRIALS WHERE THE UH THE EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF IT PROBABLY REALLY PLAYED IN  (fe_03_06471-A-0017)
WELL THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_06471-A-0018)
WELL AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS WHAT THE JUDGE ALLOWS AND DOESN'T ALLOW AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS THING HAPPENED IN THE GUYS PAST BUT IT'S NOT ALLOWABLE FOR WHATEVER BIZARRE REASON  (fe_03_06471-A-0019)
