SO YOU THINK IT'S FINE FOR ALL CRIMINAL TRIALS TO BE A- ANY CRIMINAL TRIALS TO BE TELEVISED  (fe_03_06472-A-0006)
WELL I MEAN I I CAN SEE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE I I THINK THERE IS A DANGER IN KEEPING THINGS THAT THE PUBLIC HAVE AN INTEREST IN SECRET 'CAUSE THEY THEN POWER CAN BE ABUSED AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON I JUST THINK THAT  (fe_03_06472-A-0007)
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S LIKE UM [LIPSMACK] I DON'T KNOW A VIOLENT CRIME OR DEFINITELY A SEX CRIME THEN I MEAN  (fe_03_06472-A-0008)

WELL THAT'S I I'M SURPRISED I I DON'T AGREE I NO  (fe_03_06472-A-0013)
[LIPSMACK] I THINK IT'S FAIR ENOUGH FOR THE COURT RECORD TO BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AFTER THE TRIAL IS FINISHED  (fe_03_06472-A-0015)
BUT MAYBE NOT A LIVE TRIAL  (fe_03_06472-A-0016)
UM  (fe_03_06472-A-0017)
AND I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME RESTRICTION ON IT I DON'T KNOW I JUST I MEAN I I HAVE FRIENDS THAT UM HAVE BEEN IN VAR- IN LEGAL TROUBLE AND AND WHATEVER AND SOME OF THEM SOUND GUILTY AND SOME OF THEM SOUND INNOCENT  (fe_03_06472-A-0018)

WHERE SOMEONE'S ACCUSED OF ROBBING SOMEONE AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY INNOCENT AND THEY GO THROUGH THE TRIAL AND THEY'RE FOUND INNOCENT IS THERE NOT THE SAME DANGER THAT THAT PERSON WILL  (fe_03_06472-A-0033)
YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN LOOK AT IT SAYING WELL YOU KNOW A GUILTY PERSON MIGHT GET AWAY WITH THINGS AND THEY WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT IF IT'S ON T._V. BUT I MEAN DOESN'T THAT LIKE  (fe_03_06472-A-0034)
