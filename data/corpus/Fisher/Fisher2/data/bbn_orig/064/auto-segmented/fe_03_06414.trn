WITH ME IT'S DEALING WITH AH WITH THE FACT THAT THERE AIN'T TOO MANY PLACES TO HIDE IF IT'S A BIOLOGICAL ATTACK  (fe_03_06414-B-0027)
IF IT'S SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY THEN YOU KNOW BASICALLY IT'S ONLY KEEPING UP IN A- UP INFORMATION JUST MONITORING IT AND THE FACT THAT IT WORKS WITH A NON PROFIT YOU KNOW IT KIND OF HELPS  (fe_03_06414-B-0028)

ON DATES I'D SIT BACK AND LET SOMEONE ELSE MAKE THE MOVE BUT I'M VERY LOGICALLY THINKING I'VE VERY PROACTIVE  (fe_03_06414-B-0034)
OTHERWISE SO IT'S REALLY REALLY IT'S REALLY REALLY ABOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU CAN DO FIRST  (fe_03_06414-B-0035)
AHEAD OF TIMES THINKING ABOUT IT SO THAT WHEN THE TIME COMES YOU DON'T PANIC YOU DON'T SWEAT YOU DON'T WORRY YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO AND IF YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING YOU CAN ACCEPT IT THEN  (fe_03_06414-B-0036)

YEAH EXACTLY WELL THE THING IS YOU CAN UM PEOPLE SAY THAT AH PLANNERS WORRY A LITTLE BIT  (fe_03_06414-B-0042)
BUT I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND I THINK THE FACT THAT WE PLAN AHEAD ALLOWS US NOT TO WORRY ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS  (fe_03_06414-B-0043)
IT ALLOWS US NOT TO HAVE THAT ANXIETY  (fe_03_06414-B-0044)

UH-HUH YEAH  (fe_03_06414-B-0046)

I JUST READ AN ARTICLE AS A MATTER OF FACT YEAH UM TALKING ABOUT THAT THEY WILL RISK THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR PETS  (fe_03_06414-B-0050)
THEY WILL GO THEY WILL STAY THERE FOR THEIR PETS AND THE RED CROSS DOESN'T ACCEPT PETS SO THEY'LL SIT THERE AT HOME IN THE MIDDLE OF A FLOOD OR TORNADO OR SOMETHING TOTALLY WASTED HOUSE STARVING OR YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06414-B-0051)

BEING THIRSTY TO THE MAX AND THEY'LL TREAT THEIR DOG OR THEIR CAT LIKE A LIKE A CHILD THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT FIRST BEFORE THEMSELVES  (fe_03_06414-B-0053)

TOWARD AH MAINTAINING AH ANIMALS AT A LOCATION WHERE RED CROSS IS  (fe_03_06414-B-0058)
