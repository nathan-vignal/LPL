THE NUCLEAR FAMILY  (fe_03_08188-A-0022)

AND THE PERSON THAT'S THERE AT NIGHT WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP THAT TYPE OF THING BUT I WAS JUST THINKING UM  (fe_03_08188-A-0025)
I THINK  (fe_03_08188-A-0026)
IT DOESN'T AFFECT MAYBE FAMILY VALUES BUT IT DOES AFFECT FAMILY STRUCTURE IF KIDS ARE PULLED ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS  (fe_03_08188-A-0027)
AND JUST THE THE EXHAUSTION AND I KNOW I'VE GOT LOTS OF FRIENDS THAT ARE UM IN SECOND OR THIRD MARRIAGES WHERE THEY HAVE COMBINED  (fe_03_08188-A-0028)
HIS HERS AND THEIRS TYPE OF THING  (fe_03_08188-A-0029)

UM  (fe_03_08188-A-0042)

AH SO MANY WOMEN JUST HANG AROUND HOPING IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER GOING TO GET BETTER  (fe_03_08188-A-0045)
AND IT DOESN'T AND IN THEIR QUESTION THAT THEY ASKED US ABOUT WHETHER IT CHANGES YOUR FAMILY VALUES I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES IT IF ANYTHING I THINK IT SHOWS WHAT WE WANT  (fe_03_08188-A-0046)
UM AND LIKE YOU SAID WHAT YOU WOULD LOOK FOR THE NEXT TIME AROUND  (fe_03_08188-A-0047)

UM KINDA PROBE IN YOUR HEAD SINCE I FORTUNATELY HAVEN'T BEEN IN THAT POSITION BUT DO YOU THINK UM PEOPLE  (fe_03_08188-A-0056)
ARE JUST MORE INCLINED TO GET OUT INSTEAD OF STICK IT THROUGH  (fe_03_08188-A-0057)
OH I'D LIKE YOUR OPINION ON THAT BECAUSE SEVERAL PEOPLE SAY WELL THAT MAKES YOU STUCK AND I'M WITH YOU I THINK IT JUST GIVES MORE FORETHOUGHT  (fe_03_08188-A-0058)

UM THEY THINK MAYBE THEY'LL DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO THEM BUT  (fe_03_08188-A-0083)
I FIND THAT UM  (fe_03_08188-A-0084)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING OF THE HEADLINES AND STUFF WE OFTEN  (fe_03_08188-A-0085)
MISSED THE PART THAT THERE'S A LOT OF GRIEVING PEOPLE OUT THERE SO I GUESS IN THE PART THAT TALKS ABOUT CHANGING YOUR YOUR OPINION ON FAMILY VALUES IT  (fe_03_08188-A-0086)
IF ANYTHING IT JUST MAKES YOU YEARN FOR THAT  (fe_03_08188-A-0087)
THAT MUCH MORE  (fe_03_08188-A-0088)
AND WANTING TO  (fe_03_08188-A-0089)

UM YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED BEFORE  (fe_03_08188-B-0002)

YES I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN DIVORCED TWICE I'VE BEEN MARRIED THREE TIMES  (fe_03_08188-B-0004)
I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT IT WAS EITHER  (fe_03_08188-B-0007)
BECAUSE IT WAS CUTTING IN AND OUT SO ALL I KNOW IS SOMETHING ABOUT HAS DIVORCED CHANGED THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT MARRIAGE BEING MARRIED AND THINGS  (fe_03_08188-B-0008)
YEAH  (fe_03_08188-B-0009)
UM ACTUALLY NO I DON'T I MEAN I HAVE AN OPINION BUT I DON'T THINK DIVORCE HAS HAS CHANGED MY FAMILY VALUES OR ANYTHING  (fe_03_08188-B-0010)
UM  (fe_03_08188-B-0011)
P- PEOPLE GET DIVORCED FOR DIFFERENT REASONS YOU KNOW I MEAN SOMETIMES IT JUST ISN'T GOING TO WORK OUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES  (fe_03_08188-B-0012)
THE OTHER BUT  (fe_03_08188-B-0013)
THAT YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T CHANGE DIDN'T CHANGE MY OPINION  (fe_03_08188-B-0014)
ON VALUES OR ANYTHING  (fe_03_08188-B-0015)
I HAVE CHILDREN FROM MY FIRST MARRIAGE  (fe_03_08188-B-0016)
[NOISE] NOT REALLY  (fe_03_08188-B-0017)
BECAUSE  (fe_03_08188-B-0018)
THEY WERE TWO AND FIVE WHEN WE GOT A DIVORCE  (fe_03_08188-B-0019)
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY  (fe_03_08188-B-0020)
PROBABLY CLOSER TO THE MAN I'M MARRIED TO NOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS THAN THEY ARE THEIR FATHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY GET ALONG WITH THEIR FATHER THAT WELL BECAUSE HE HASN'T S- HE HAS CHILDREN BY THIS BECAUSE HE REMARRIED ALSO  (fe_03_08188-B-0021)
AND THEY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08188-B-0022)
REALLY DON'T LIKE TO GO SEE HIM  (fe_03_08188-B-0023)
BECAUSE HE MAKES A IN 'EM  (fe_03_08188-B-0024)
NO HE HAD NEVER BEEN MARRIED AND DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN  (fe_03_08188-B-0026)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08188-B-0028)
YES  (fe_03_08188-B-0029)
RIGHT AND SO THAT WAS I MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE WHEN  (fe_03_08188-B-0031)
I DECIDED TO BE REMARRIED  (fe_03_08188-B-0032)
THAT I DIDN'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE WITH KIDS BECAUSE  (fe_03_08188-B-0033)
MY KIDS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ME  (fe_03_08188-B-0034)
I WASN'T FOR SURE HOW I WOULD FEEL ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND HOW THEY WOULD FEEL ABOUT MINE IF WE YOU KNOW EACH HAD OUR OWN AND THAT WAS A CONSCIOUS DECISION I MADE  (fe_03_08188-B-0035)
YOU KNOW HE HAD NEVER BEEN MARRIED AND HE DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN AND HE DIDN'T WANT HIS OWN CHILDREN HE WANTS KIDS BUT HE DIDN'T WANT HIS OWN  (fe_03_08188-B-0036)
ONE'S ALMOST THIRTEEN AND THE OTHER ONE WILL BE ELEVEN  (fe_03_08188-B-0038)
MHM  (fe_03_08188-B-0039)
MHM  (fe_03_08188-B-0041)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08188-B-0042)
MHM  (fe_03_08188-B-0043)
IF HE WAS MARRIED  (fe_03_08188-B-0044)
WE WERE MARRIED THREE YEARS BEFORE WE HAD KIDS  (fe_03_08188-B-0045)
YEAH I D- AND MY SECOND MARRIAGE WAS JUST A KIND OF ONE OF THOSE  (fe_03_08188-B-0046)
STUPID THINGS PEOPLE DO  (fe_03_08188-B-0047)
SO IT DIDN'T LAST AND I KNEW IT WASN'T GOING TO SO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08188-B-0048)
RIGHT AND THAT'S EXACTLY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08188-B-0049)
I WAS LIKE OOPS THIS IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I EVER MADE AND SORRY AH YOU KNOW HE HAD NEVER BEEN MARRIED EITHER AND I'M LIKE YOU KNOW SORRY BUT IT'S NOT WORKING AND [NOISE] MN NN  (fe_03_08188-B-0050)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08188-B-0051)
MHM  (fe_03_08188-B-0052)
NO I DON'T THINK IT DOES  (fe_03_08188-B-0053)
YEAH BECAUSE I MEAN I WAS FROM A DIVORCED I MEAN MY PARENTS WERE DIVORCED AND  (fe_03_08188-B-0054)
I  (fe_03_08188-B-0055)
DON'T THINK I HAD ANY DIFFERENT VALUES THAN  (fe_03_08188-B-0056)
MY FRIENDS WHO YOU KNOW WHOSE PARENTS STAYED MARRIED MY GRANDPARENTS WERE MARRIED YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU KNOW MY MOTHER WASN'T  (fe_03_08188-B-0057)
EXPECTING TO GET A DIVORCE OR ANYTHING AND  (fe_03_08188-B-0058)
I  (fe_03_08188-B-0059)
PEOPLE'S VALUES WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG ARE USUALLY ABOUT THE SAME ANYWAY EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET MARRIED AND STAY MARRIED FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE I MEAN  (fe_03_08188-B-0060)
THINGS HAPPEN I MEAN THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE  (fe_03_08188-B-0061)
IT'S HAPPENED EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME  (fe_03_08188-B-0062)
SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT'S VALUES AT ALL  (fe_03_08188-B-0063)
PEOPLE CAN LET IT AFFECT THEM PERSONALLY WHICH COULD COULD POSSIBLY AFFECT THEIR VALUES BUT I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_08188-B-0064)
GENERALLY SPEAKING IT AFFECTS PEOPLE'S VALUES  (fe_03_08188-B-0065)
MHM I THINK IF THEY MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET A DIVORCE  (fe_03_08188-B-0066)
THEN PEOPLE WOULD NOT GET MARRIED AS EASILY AS THEY DID  (fe_03_08188-B-0067)
MHM  (fe_03_08188-B-0068)
BECAUSE LIKE MY SECOND MARRIAGE I KNOW IF  (fe_03_08188-B-0069)
IT WOULD IF I WOULD HAVE WAITED BECAUSE MY MOTHER PA WE GOT MARRIED IN APRIL MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY NINE DAYS AFTER I GOT MARRIED  (fe_03_08188-B-0070)
AND MY MOTHER HADN'T HAVE BEEN MAR- YOU KNOW HADN'T HAVE PASSED AWAY HAD PASSED AWAY BEFORE I GOT MARRIED I WOULD NEVER HAVE MARRIED HIM  (fe_03_08188-B-0072)
AND BECAUSE I GOT HIT YOU KNOW LIKE RIGHT IN THE HEAD WITH A SLEDGE HAMMER LIKE OOH MY LIFE HAS TOTALLY CHANGED I WAS AN ONLY CHILD AND  (fe_03_08188-B-0073)
MY MOTHER WAS FORTY FIVE WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY  (fe_03_08188-B-0074)
YOU KNOW SO  (fe_03_08188-B-0075)
AND I WAS LIKE OOH  (fe_03_08188-B-0076)
AND THAT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH ME PERSONALLY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08188-B-0077)
AND OUR MARRIAGE I KNEW  (fe_03_08188-B-0078)
BASICALLY WALKING DOWN THE AISLE THAT THAT MARRIAGE WASN'T GOING TO WORK  (fe_03_08188-B-0079)
BUT BUT YOU KNOW I WAS TO THE POINT THAT AH EVERYONE WAS THERE  (fe_03_08188-B-0080)
AND MY WHAT WAS REALLY GOOD WAS MY MOTHER HAD CHECKED HERSELF OUT OF THE HOSPITAL TO COME TO MY WEDDING  (fe_03_08188-B-0081)
BECAUSE SHE HAPPENED TO BE IN HOSPITAL  (fe_03_08188-B-0082)

WE ONE OF THOSE THAT HAPPENED AND I COULDN'T DO THAT FOR HER YOU KNOW BUT I MEAN SHE HAD DONE THAT LIKE YOU KNOW SO I MEAN NOT YOU KNOW WALKING DOWN THE AISLE IT WASN'T WORKING  (fe_03_08188-B-0084)
