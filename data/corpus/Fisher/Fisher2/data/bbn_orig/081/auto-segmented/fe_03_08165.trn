SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THE  (fe_03_08165-A-0004)
HOW HAS THE DIVORCE RATE AFFECTED THE WAY WE SEE MARRIAGE BASICALLY  (fe_03_08165-A-0005)
OH OKAY  (fe_03_08165-A-0006)

RIGHT  (fe_03_08165-A-0011)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08165-A-0012)
MY THING IS THAT I THINK A LOT OF UM MARRIED COUPLES THINK THAT THAT'S THE EASY WAY OUT OF THEIR PROBLEMS BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN DIVORCED UM  (fe_03_08165-A-0013)
AND I THINK IT'S A CHOICE THAT YOU MAKE BUT A LOT OF THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE GET DIVORCED THEY DON'T REALIZE HOW IT AFFECTS EVERYBODY ELSE IN THEIR FAMILY  (fe_03_08165-A-0014)
AND I THINK THAT IT'S TAKEN VERY LIGHTLY I JUST THINK IT'S YOU KNOW THE EASY WAY OUT  (fe_03_08165-A-0015)
MHM  (fe_03_08165-A-0016)

OH YEAH  (fe_03_08165-A-0031)
IT IS AWKWARD ESPECIALLY I THINK I MEAN MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN MARRIED  (fe_03_08165-A-0032)
LIKE  (fe_03_08165-A-0033)
THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND  (fe_03_08165-A-0034)
BACK WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED IT WAS NOT COMMON FOR DIVORCE  (fe_03_08165-A-0035)
AND THEY STUCK TOGETHER THROUGH THICK AND THIN I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR TEN YEARS AND IT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD BUT YOU STICK YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT AND YOU STICK  (fe_03_08165-A-0036)
I JUST THINK YOU KNOW I'M A CHRISTIAN AS WELL AND MY VALUES ARE DIVORCE IS NOT AN OPTION YOU WORK THINGS OUT YOU GET COUNSELLING YOU GET HELP  (fe_03_08165-A-0037)
YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING  (fe_03_08165-A-0038)
WORKS  (fe_03_08165-A-0039)
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN AND YOU KNOW IT JUST INVOLVES SO MUCH  (fe_03_08165-A-0040)
OH YEAH IT'S IT'S IT'S A HUGE  (fe_03_08165-A-0041)
IT'S A HUGE BLOW TO ANYBODY I MEAN WHAT A LOT OF KIDS DO IS THAT THEY REBEL OR THEY  (fe_03_08165-A-0042)
GO TO OTHER THINGS TO MEET THAT NEED BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE SO WRAPPED UP IN THEIR DIVORCE THEY CAN'T MEET THEIR NEEDS  (fe_03_08165-A-0043)
OH I AGREE I COMPLETELY AGREE  (fe_03_08165-A-0044)
I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SELFISH THINGS AROUND  (fe_03_08165-A-0045)
LIKE I SAID IT'S THAT PEOPLE TAKE IT AS THE EASY WAY OUT OH I'M FIGHTING TOO MUCH AND I JUST WANT OUT AND INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE PUT TOGETHER FOR A REASON  (fe_03_08165-A-0046)

UM NOT REALLY THEIR VIEWS ON MARRIAGE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT ALL ALL OF MY UM FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DIVORCED EXCEPT FOR MY PARENTS  (fe_03_08165-A-0054)
AND EXCEPT FOR ME I'VE NEVER BEEN DIVORCED  (fe_03_08165-A-0055)

RIGHT AND IT'S EASIER TO GET DIVORCED THAN IT IS TO GET MARRIED  (fe_03_08165-A-0079)
IT'S IT'S SAD I KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH IT AND HAVE REGRETTED IT  (fe_03_08165-A-0080)

I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR TO THEM  (fe_03_08165-A-0095)
BUT YEAH IT'S  (fe_03_08165-A-0096)
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU JUST IT DEPENDS ON YOUR MORALS AND THE WAY YOU VIEW THINGS A LOT OF PEOPLE VIEW IT AS OH WELL THEY'RE JUST NOT MEETING MY NEED AND THEY HAVE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ON EACH OTHER  (fe_03_08165-A-0097)
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY  (fe_03_08165-A-0098)
GO INTO A MARRIAGE WITH THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ALL DO  (fe_03_08165-A-0099)
EVERYBODY THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE SO GREAT AND WONDERFUL [NOISE]  (fe_03_08165-A-0100)

THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF GOING INTO MARRIAGE THAT EVEN IF I MY HUSBAND AND I WENT THROUGH A UM MARRIAGE CLASS AND IT TALKED ABOUT LIKE THE POWER OF THE  (fe_03_08165-A-0107)
SPOKEN WORD AND HOW YOUR WORDS ONCE THEY LEAVE YOUR MOUTH YOU CAN NEVER TAKE 'EM BACK AND SO THEY SAY DON'T EVER SPEAK DIVORCE INTO YOUR MARRIAGE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT BACK  (fe_03_08165-A-0108)

IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE GET HURT THAT WAY  (fe_03_08165-A-0112)

UM  (fe_03_08165-B-0006)
DIVORCE I THINK IT DOES AFFECT HOW PEOPLE THINK AND HOW PEOPLE ACT  (fe_03_08165-B-0009)
BECAUSE  (fe_03_08165-B-0010)
MOST OF THE KIDS IN MY SCHOOL  (fe_03_08165-B-0011)
THEIR P- IF THEIR PARENTS ARE DIVORCED THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE MOSTLY DEPRESSED  (fe_03_08165-B-0012)
OR ARE UNHAPPY  (fe_03_08165-B-0013)
IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_08165-B-0014)
OR THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOSTLY RUDE OR GO TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL FIRST  (fe_03_08165-B-0015)
EXACTLY EXACTLY  (fe_03_08165-B-0017)
YEAH WELL SEE I'M INDIAN  (fe_03_08165-B-0018)

AND MY MOM AND DAD AND MOSTLY ALL MY AUNTS AND UNCLES AND ALMOST EVERY INDIAN OLDER COUPLE THAT I KNOW HAS HAD ARRANGED MARRIAGES  (fe_03_08165-B-0021)
ARRANGED MARRIAGES WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_08165-B-0022)
EACH OTHER YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ALL THEY KNEW LIKE ALL THEY KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER WAS LIKE IT'S VERY COMMON IN INDIA SO I MEAN IT'S NOT ANYTHING LIKE THE KIDS REBEL AGAINST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A TRADITION YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08165-B-0023)
SO ALL THEY KNEW IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE THEY GOT MARRIED AND THEY'RE LIVING A HAPPY LIFE YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT LIKE SO I MEAN  (fe_03_08165-B-0024)
IN AMERICA IT'S USUALLY LOVE MARRIAGES AND FOR SOME REASON THERE'S MORE  (fe_03_08165-B-0025)
DIVORCE OVER HERE THAN THERE IS IN INDIA  (fe_03_08165-B-0026)
