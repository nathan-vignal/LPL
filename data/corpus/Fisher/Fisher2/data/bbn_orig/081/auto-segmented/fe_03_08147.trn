DEALS WITH SAFETY ISSUES  (fe_03_08147-A-0008)
UM SOMEBODY ON DRUGS CAN EITHER GET HURT OR HURT OTHER PEOPLE  (fe_03_08147-A-0009)
AND UM I JUST REALLY DON'T THINK IF THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEM PRESCRIPTIONWISE OR UNPRESCRIPTION THEY NEED TO BE AT WORK WITH THEM AND THAT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING YOU DO IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DRUGS IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU SHOULD DO IT AT HOME  (fe_03_08147-A-0010)
SO I KNOW THAT UM  (fe_03_08147-A-0011)
I'VE WORKED FOR THE SAME COMPANY FOR A LONG TIME AND RIGHT AFTER I HAD MY CHILD I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN MY DEPARTMENT  (fe_03_08147-A-0012)
SO THE COMPUTER KEPT RANDOMLY PULLING ME SINCE I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THAT DEPARTMENT THAT WAS A LITTLE ANNOYING  (fe_03_08147-A-0013)
I HAD TO GO FOR A DRUG TEST YOU KNOW LIKE EVERY TWO WEEKS  (fe_03_08147-A-0014)

OH MY GOD URINE AND BLOOD  (fe_03_08147-B-0015)
OH  (fe_03_08147-B-0016)
YEAH OKAY WELL MY OPINION IS THAT UM  (fe_03_08147-B-0018)
IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION THAT AH ENCUMBERS OR BEARS ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY  (fe_03_08147-B-0019)
THAT AH IT IS OKAY TO DO RANDOM DRUG TESTS  (fe_03_08147-B-0020)
AH AND ASSUMING YOU WERE HIRED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT WOULD BE DONE IN OTHER WORDS IT'S NOT A POLICY I WOULD SPRING ON PEOPLE I WOULD LET 'EM KNOW FROM THE TIME THEY HIRE IN OR YOU KNOW FROM THE TIME YOU INSTITUTE THE POLICY THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE OCCURRING  (fe_03_08147-B-0021)
AND THAT AH KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THAT I I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT IS A GOOD THING TO DO IN GENERAL BECAUSE I GET VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ASPECTS OF IT  (fe_03_08147-B-0022)
AND THAT ANY KIND OF ENCROACHMENT ON WHAT WE DO IN OUR OWN TIME IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANY RIGHT TO DO  (fe_03_08147-B-0023)
AH AGAIN UNLESS THEY'RE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES AND THERE'S CERTAIN DRUGS THAT STAY IN YOUR SYSTEM SO EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THEM AT WORK  (fe_03_08147-B-0024)
THEY HAVE A SHELF LIFE IN YOUR BLOOD OR YOUR URINE WHATEVER SO YOU MIGHT SAY SMOKE MARIJUANA ON THE WEEKEND BE PERFECTLY SOBER AT WORK AND UM  (fe_03_08147-B-0025)
BUT IT WOULD SHOW UP IN YOUR SYSTEM AND I I JUST HAVE UM  (fe_03_08147-B-0026)
OH IT D- IT DEFINITELY STAYS IN YOUR SYSTEM AH BUT IF IT'S NOT IMPAIRING YOUR WORK OR IF YOU'RE NOT IN A POSITION AGAIN WHERE I THINK SAFETY IS INVOLVED  (fe_03_08147-B-0027)
YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE  (fe_03_08147-B-0028)
YEAH I YOU YOU MEAN MARIJUANA  (fe_03_08147-B-0029)
YEAH  (fe_03_08147-B-0030)
WELL SEE I THINK WHAT GETS TRICKY ABOUT THAT IS AND WHILE DRUGS ARE NOT APPEALING TO ME PERSONALLY ITS AND I MEAN I'M FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND IT IS SIMPLY NOT SOMETHING I DO  (fe_03_08147-B-0031)
THERE YOU GO WELL UM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08147-B-0033)
IF I HAD IF I HAD A MISSPENT YOUTH I'D BE OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MOTHER BUT AH  (fe_03_08147-B-0034)
BUT BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW TO ME THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ISSUES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE I MEAN THEY DON'T TR- TRUST I'M SORRY THEY DON'T TEST FOR ALCOHOL FOR INSTANCE AND ALCOHOL  (fe_03_08147-B-0035)

WHICH WHICH AH WHICH DRUG  (fe_03_08147-B-0037)

YEAH I TH- I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY LONG TIME EVEN AND OTHER THINGS MIMIC IT LIKE YOU KNOW POPPY SEEDS LIKE IF YOU'RE A POPPY SEED BAGEL PERSON  (fe_03_08147-B-0039)
THAT POPPY SEEDS WILL LOOK LIKE MARIJUANA YEAH I MEAN I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST AND I'VE DEALT WITH THIS WITH CLIENTS AND PEOPLE HAVE TESTED POSITIVE THAT WEREN'T POSITIVE AND THEY GO THROUGH THESE RIGMAROLES WITH IT AND YOU STOP EATING YOUR POPPY SEED BAGELS BUT  (fe_03_08147-B-0040)
I I MEAN THERE THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT IMPAIR PEOPLE'S FUNCTIONING PEOPLE DON'T SLEEP RIGHT PEOPLE STAY OUT LATE PARTYING  (fe_03_08147-B-0041)
AH PEOPLE DRINK THEY DRINK AT LUNCH UM THERE THERE  (fe_03_08147-B-0042)
THERE THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS  (fe_03_08147-B-0043)
RIGHT AND PEOPLE DON'T TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEMSELVES  (fe_03_08147-B-0044)
AND AND IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHERE TO ME WHERE DO YOU DRAW A LINE AND WHERE DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE YOU'RE ADULT NOW HERE'S THE DEAL IF SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING THEN  (fe_03_08147-B-0045)
THAT'S LIKE A PROBLEM AT WORK AND THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING ILLEGAL IN THEIR SYSTEM TO ME THEY'RE CULPABLE AT THAT POINT BUT I THINK TO HAVE ESPECIALLY BLOOD TESTS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M REAL SQUEAMISH ABOUT THAT I HATE NEEDLES I MEAN IT'S A URINE TEST IS ONE THING  (fe_03_08147-B-0046)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_08147-B-0047)

BUT I JUST  (fe_03_08147-B-0051)
I MEAN THERE THERE'S THAT THAT WHOLE DIALECTIC OF THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND THEN THE COMMUNAL WELL BEING BUT I THINK I THINK ONE OF THE REALLY STRONG THINGS WE HAVE AS AMERICANS IS IS THE IDEA OF PERSONAL LIBERTY  (fe_03_08147-B-0052)
WHICH IS NOT THE SAME THING AS PERSONAL LICENSE  (fe_03_08147-B-0053)
YEAH  (fe_03_08147-B-0054)
WELL THAT'S REALLY TRUE THAT THAT  (fe_03_08147-B-0055)

AH YEAH AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY TAKING A RISK IN EVEN DOING THAT IN FRONT OF YOU IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR OWN INTEREST IS  (fe_03_08147-B-0066)
HOW ABOUT THAT SEE THAT THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING POINT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S MANY PEOPLE AROUND THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT POT SMELLS LIKE BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE  (fe_03_08147-B-0067)
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY LIKE AT A PARTY SOMEWHERE AND YOU ARE SO NAIVE THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE AND YOU GET TESTED AND YOU GET BUSTED ON THE FACT THAT YOU HAD THE SECONDHAND SMOKE FROM SOMEONE  (fe_03_08147-B-0068)
