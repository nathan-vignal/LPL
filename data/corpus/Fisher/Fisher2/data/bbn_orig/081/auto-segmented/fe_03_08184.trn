ARE IN YOUR LIFE  (fe_03_08184-B-0007)
AND DO YOU THINK THAT AH  (fe_03_08184-B-0008)
THAT IT'S CHANGING BECAUSE  (fe_03_08184-B-0009)
OF THE INCREASE IN THE DIVORCE RATE IN THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_08184-B-0010)
WELL I LIVE IN CANADA BUT I'M SURE [LAUGHTER] I'M SURE IT'S THE SAME THERE  (fe_03_08184-B-0011)

SO HOW HAVE YOU HOW HOW IT IS LIKE SAY IN YOUR COMMUNITY DO YOU LIKE I I'VE JUST GOT BACK FROM TRAVELING TODAY  (fe_03_08184-B-0013)
AND ACTUALLY ONE OF THE LAST PLACES THAT I WAS AT AND THEY WERE SAYING OH YES YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO BE A REAL COMMON THING LIKE AND SORT OF THE BABY BOOMER  (fe_03_08184-B-0014)
GENERATION  (fe_03_08184-B-0015)
THEIR KIDS HAVE SORT OF LIKE GROWN UP NOW LEAVING COLLEGE AND IT SEEMS THERE'S THIS HUGE RASH OF DIVORCES  (fe_03_08184-B-0016)
ARE YOU NOTICING ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN YOUR AREA THAT YOU LIVE IN  (fe_03_08184-B-0017)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08184-B-0018)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08184-B-0019)
SO DO YOU F- E- PART OF THE THING THAT I SEE THAT SAY LIKE WAS DIFFERENT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN MY PARENTS YOU KNOW LIKE  (fe_03_08184-B-0020)
LAST GENERATION LIKE DIVORCE WASN'T SO COMMON BUT WOMEN DIDN'T WORK OUT OF HOME  (fe_03_08184-B-0021)
SO IT WAS LIKE SORT OF PEOPLE I THINK TENDED TO MORE WORK TOGETHER WHETHER IT WAS GOOD OR BAD I DON'T REALLY KNOW LIKE I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT THINGS WEREN'T  (fe_03_08184-B-0022)
AS SAY FAMILY V- LIKE IF A WOMAN WAS IN A BAD RELATIONSHIP SHE WOULD STAY IN THE HOUSE RATHER THAN MOVE OUT  (fe_03_08184-B-0023)
AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THOSE OPTIONS BUT I DO THINK THAT BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE MONEY THESE DAYS  (fe_03_08184-B-0024)
THAT PEOPLE TEND TO SORT OF LIKE DITCH RELATIONSHIPS A LITTLE FASTER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN PEOPLE STAYED TOGETHER FOR ALL THESE FOR THESE ALL THESE OTHER REASONS THE KIDS THE MONEY THE  (fe_03_08184-B-0025)
SO IT'S KINDA CHANGED THAT WAY TOO  (fe_03_08184-B-0026)

IT IS THAT BECAUSE AH MEN IN OUR SOCIETY HAVEN'T  (fe_03_08184-B-0034)
REACHED THAT LEVEL THAT WOMEN HAVE OF BEING ABLE TO  (fe_03_08184-B-0035)
OPEN IT UP AND ADMIT TO OUR PROBLEMS AND SHE SAYS THAT MEN DON'T HAVE THAT OUTLET  (fe_03_08184-B-0037)
BE ABLE TO ADMIT SHE SAYS THAT THEY HAVE CASUAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT HAVE DEEP MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP IS SORT OF LACKING  (fe_03_08184-B-0038)
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AND YOU COMPARE THAT TO OUR FAMILIES IT'S JUST STARTING TO CHANGE WHERE  (fe_03_08184-B-0039)
MEN ARE TAKING A ROLE WHERE YOU KNOW LIKE THE FATHER'S APPROACH WAS TO TALK TO NOT JUST THE BREADWINNER  (fe_03_08184-B-0040)
