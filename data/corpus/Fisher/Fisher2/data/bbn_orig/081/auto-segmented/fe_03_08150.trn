OF COURSE IT DOES UM OF COURSE I'M OLDER I'M IN MY SEVENTIES SO  (fe_03_08150-B-0007)
UM WE'VE HAD A VERY STABLE MARRIAGE OF COURSE NOT THAT MY KIDS DIDN'T EVER HAVE PROBLEMS THEY DID  (fe_03_08150-B-0008)
BUT I THINK I SEE IT MORESO IN MY GRANDCHILDREN BECAUSE I HAVE THREE DIVORCED CHILDREN WITH CHILDREN  (fe_03_08150-B-0009)
AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE A [MN] GRANDSON GOING THROUGH A REALLY REALLY BAD TIME  (fe_03_08150-B-0010)

AND AH I DON'T NOW I LOOK AROUND AND I SEE THE GIRL ACROSS THE STREET'S DIVORCED AND SHE'S GOT A GIRL A LITTLE GIRL AND YOU KNOW SHE SEEMS BECAUSE SHE'S ONLY GOING INTO HIGH SCHOOL THIS YEAR  (fe_03_08150-B-0013)
TROUBLE MAY BE AHEAD BUT SHE SEEMS TO BE VERY WELL ADJUSTED I THINK BECAUSE SHE HAS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER  (fe_03_08150-B-0014)
WHICH I THINK IS UNUSUAL  (fe_03_08150-B-0015)
BECAUSE HE LIVES HERE AROUND HERE SO SHE CAN GO THERE AH DURING THE WEEK AND SHE CAN GO ON WEEKENDS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A LOT EASIER  (fe_03_08150-B-0016)
IT'S TOUGH TODAY ON KIDS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08150-B-0017)
AND YOUR HUSBAND UM  (fe_03_08150-B-0018)
DOESN'T SEE THE CHILDREN THAT MUCH  (fe_03_08150-B-0019)

THE VALUES GO AND NOBODY'S HOME YOU KNOW THE KIDS ARE COMING HOME ALONE AND THEN THEY GET IN TROUBLE THEY'RE ON THE COMPUTER AND  (fe_03_08150-B-0029)
IT'S A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE AND YOU CAN'T HELP THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SURVIVE  (fe_03_08150-B-0030)

YOU KNOW MAKE UP SOME KIDS ARE MORE  (fe_03_08150-B-0034)
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW MORE STEADY AND HAVE MORE COMMONSENSE AND OTHERS DON'T  (fe_03_08150-B-0035)
BUT WHATEVER BUT AH AS I SAY I SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN IT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE RIGHT IT  (fe_03_08150-B-0036)
CAN ONLY GET WORSE  (fe_03_08150-B-0037)

SO THERE'S PROBLEMS IN EVER FAMILY LIFE IT'S NOT EVEN JUST DIVORCE BUT I THINK IT'S MORE SO IN  (fe_03_08150-B-0042)
IT'S VERY HARD AND MY SON HAVING TO FOLLOW HIS HIS SON  (fe_03_08150-B-0043)
