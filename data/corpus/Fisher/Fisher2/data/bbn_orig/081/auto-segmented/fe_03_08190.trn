FROM TENNESSEE HI  (fe_03_08190-B-0004)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08190-B-0005)
AH WELL I'M A TEACHER  (fe_03_08190-B-0006)
YEAH INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AND I ACTUALLY I'M A MATH TEACHER BUT THIS NEXT YEAR I'M GOING TO BE TEACHING ENGLISH  (fe_03_08190-B-0007)
SO THIS TOPIC ABOUT REQUIRING STUDENTS TO READ CERTAIN BOOKS IS LIKE RIGHT UP MY ALLEY SINCE I'M NOT REALLY AN ENGLISH TEACHER AND I'M HAVING TO LEARN HOW TO TEACH ENGLISH  (fe_03_08190-B-0008)
UM  (fe_03_08190-B-0009)
BUT THIS IS A DIFFICULT I I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER I USED TO BE A SYSTEMS ANALYST AND I COULD ALWAYS SAY ON THE ONE HAND BUT ON THE OTHER HAND SO MY VIEW IS THAT  (fe_03_08190-B-0010)
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT IF AH AH MOST TEACHERS RETR- YOU KNOW TRY TO PICK BOOKS THAT ENHANCE WHATEVER THE LEARNING IS THEY WANT BUT YOU HAVE SO MANY RELIGIOUS AND  (fe_03_08190-B-0011)
POLITICAL ISSUES THAT OTHER PARENTS HAVE IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT UM  (fe_03_08190-B-0012)
THIS IS NOT THIS IS KIND OF A WEIRD SEGUE BUT LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS TEACHING I HAD A STUDENT WHO WASN'T ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN CHRISTMAS PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS  (fe_03_08190-B-0013)
AND WE JUST MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIM TO GO TO STUDY HALL WHILE WE WERE PRACTISING ET CETERA AND THAT WORKED OUT OKAY AND  (fe_03_08190-B-0014)
WELL I DON'T KNOW I TALKED WITH HIS MOM AND HIM ABOUT IT I MEAN THAT'S YOU KNOW YOU WE CAN'T  (fe_03_08190-B-0015)
ABSOLUTELY MAKE EVERYTHING PERFECT FOR EVERY KID IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT'S THE THING YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TWENTY FIVE KIDS IN A CLASS AND YOU HAVE TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE WORLD SO  (fe_03_08190-B-0016)
WELL IT WAS BUT BUT THE MOM SAID AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE THEY TALKED WITH HIM ABOUT IT AND GAVE HIM THE OPTION  (fe_03_08190-B-0017)
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NICE I MEAN THEY SAID IT'S UP TO YOU AND HE SAID AND HE CHOSE  (fe_03_08190-B-0018)
TO DO THAT AND IT TURNED OUT HE COULD GO TO THE PERFORMANCE HE COULDN'T JUST HE JUST COULDN'T PARTICIPATE IN IT  (fe_03_08190-B-0019)
BUT I BRING THIS UP ON THE CENSORSHIP ISSUE BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING IF AH I'M ALWAYS SORT OF FOR THE COMPROMISE ROAD AND ONE COMPROMISE WOULD BE THAT YOU IF YOU WORKED YOU KNOW IF THE PARENTS  (fe_03_08190-B-0020)
IF YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING WITHIN THE CLASS THAT WAS OBJECTIONABLE ON RELIGIOUS TERMS  (fe_03_08190-B-0021)
TO THE PARENTS YOU COULD AH ASSIGN A DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENT TO A PARTICULAR CHILD BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MOST PARENTS COME TO THE SCHOOL AND GET INVOLVED UNLESS IT'S REALLY A SERIOUS BELIEF IS THAT WHAT YOU FEEL  (fe_03_08190-B-0022)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_08190-B-0023)

WELL NOT ONLY THAT BUT AH AND WE'RE GETTING OFF TRACK HERE BUT THE ISS- THE OUR SCHOOL HAS PUT ALL THE SPECIAL ED KIDS BACK INTO THE REGULAR CLASSES  (fe_03_08190-B-0032)
THAT'S THE AND THAT'S A FEDERAL YOU KNOW A FEDERAL THING THAT'S COMING THROUGH THE STATE WHICH I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH BUT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING SO  (fe_03_08190-B-0033)
ANYWAY SO YOU HAVE YOU'VE GOT AH KIDS OUT OF THE REGULAR SCHOOL BUT  (fe_03_08190-B-0034)
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE WHAT WOULD YOU FEEL IF THERE WAS A PARTICULAR BOOK LET'S SAY FOR AH EITHER RELIGIOUS OR SEXUAL REASONS  (fe_03_08190-B-0035)

RIGHT  (fe_03_08190-B-0046)
RIGHT THAT'S A GOOD POINT THAT'S A GOOD POINT TOO  (fe_03_08190-B-0047)
YEAH WELL I I JUST I MY SORT OF BOTTOM LINE IS IF THE IF A PARENT IS TALKING TO ME WITH KNOWLEDGE IF KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THEIR BELIEF IS AND HOW THE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO READ FITS  (fe_03_08190-B-0048)
UM AND IF THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT I'M NOT ASKING THAT THEY WOULD READ EVERY BOOK NECESSARILY BECAUSE WHAT IF THE I MEAN I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT MOST PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE GOING TO HAVE REALLY OBJECTIONABLE FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT I WOULDN'T REQUIRE SOMEBODY TO READ A BOOK JUST BECAUSE I WAS ASSIGNING IT  (fe_03_08190-B-0049)
UM BUT IF THEY COME WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT I MOST TEACHERS I THINK COULD FIND AN ALTERNATIVE AND IF THAT MAKES THE STUDENT FEEL AWKWARD OH WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE PARENTS ARE CHOOSING  (fe_03_08190-B-0050)
UH-HUH WELL ACTUALLY I'M NOT EITHER AND I'M TEACHING [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08190-B-0051)

NO AND I AND IF I AND WITH MY OWN CHILD I PROBABLY WOULD ASSESS IT THE SAME WAY UM I I HAVE THE I HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM THIS YEAR JUST TALKING FROM THE TEACHER'S POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE WE PUT ALL THE SPECIAL MOST OF THE SPECIAL ED KIDS BACK IN CLASS AND I WAS TEACHING A  (fe_03_08190-B-0059)
A MATH CLASS THAT WAS FOR THE KIDS ESSENTIALLY THAT COULDN'T GO ON INTO ALGEBRA  (fe_03_08190-B-0060)
AND SO IT WAS I HAD OUT OF TWENTY THREE KIDS I HAD FIFTEEN THAT WHERE EITHER SPECIAL ED OR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW I MEAN SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS  (fe_03_08190-B-0061)
AND MY LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR THE SPECIAL ED KIDS IS TO FOLLOW THE I._E._P. THE INDIVIDUAL EDUCATIONAL PLAN THAT LEGALLY I'M I YOU KNOW SIGNED THAT I WOULD  (fe_03_08190-B-0062)
TEACH THOSE WELL WHEN YOU HAVE SIXTEEN KIDS ALL OF WHOM NEED INDIVIDUAL  (fe_03_08190-B-0063)

EXACTLY AND AND WE HAVE WE HAVE A LOT A ZILLION KIDS LIKE THAT AND I DON'T HAVE A G- I THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I'M HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME WITH MATH BECAUSE IT'S  (fe_03_08190-B-0070)
A LOT OF KIDS ARE IN THAT SAME POSITION AND YOU'RE YOU'RE IN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE BECAUSE THE THE TEACHERS DO NOT WANT I MEAN THE PARENTS DON'T WANT THEIR KIDS TO BE LIKE LABELED SPED YOU CAN'T DO IT GO OFF AND WORK BY YOURSELF  (fe_03_08190-B-0071)
