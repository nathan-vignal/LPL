YEAH SO THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S PART OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS THAT THE PARENTS DO HAVE TO HELP WITH BECAUSE  (fe_03_08193-B-0029)
IT'S NOT I I REMEMBER UM THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BOOKS BUT WHEN I WAS TEACHING A LONG TIME AGO I I WAS KIDDING THE KIDS I SAID YOU GOTTA WATCH OUT I USED TO BE A A WARDEN IN A WOMEN'S PRISON AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH I WAS LIKE  (fe_03_08193-B-0030)
TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD OR SOMETHING LONG BLOND HAIR DIDN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE A WARDEN SO I THOUGHT FOR SURE THEY KNEW THAT IT WASN'T TRUE IT WAS A JOKE  (fe_03_08193-B-0031)
BUT THE KIDS CAME UP TO ME A COUPLE DAYS LATER AND ASKED ME WHAT PRISON IT WAS I MEAN THEY TOTALLY BELIEVED IT AND I I SAID OKAY DON'T DO THAT AGAIN TO MYSELF [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08193-B-0032)
THEY WILL BECAUSE YOU'RE THE YOU'RE THE AUTHORITY FIGURE UP THERE IN FRONT OF THEM AND I I DO THINK ABOUT THAT AND I AND I I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT THAT WHEN I HAVE TO ASSIGN THE READING THINGS TO THE KIDS  (fe_03_08193-B-0033)
UM THE REASON I WAS ASKING YOU ABOUT YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION IS THAT IF I YOU KNOW I WILL NOT CHOOSE A BOOK TO TO THE KIDS IF I THINK THERE'S SOME PARTICULAR OBJECTION BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T ALWAYS JUDGE THAT AND I WANTED TO KNOW  (fe_03_08193-B-0034)
FROM THE PARENT'S POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW COMING THE OTHER DIRECTION HOW TO TALK WITH THEM BECAUSE I HAVE FOUND TALKING WITH EVERY PARENT I'VE EVER TALKED WITH  (fe_03_08193-B-0035)
IF YOU ARE WORKING WITH WHAT YOU CAN YOU DO FOR THAT CHILD IN THAT CLASS GIVEN AN ISSUE  (fe_03_08193-B-0036)

WELL FOUNDED IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY HAD A LEGITIMATE  (fe_03_08193-B-0038)
BELIEF SYSTEM THAT THEY AND THEY CAME TO ME WITH A WHAT CAN WE DO THAT I WOULD ASSIGN A DIFFERENT BOOK OR MAKE AN ALTERNATIVE  (fe_03_08193-B-0039)
READING SUGGESTION IN OTHER WORDS I I I LIKE TO PICK MY BATTLES AND THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO MAKE A CHILD READ SOMETHING THAT THEIR PARENTS DON'T WANT THEM TO READ THAT'S WHY I ASKED IF YOU'D BEEN TO TALK TO THE TEACHERS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW THE TEACHERS ARE REACTING  (fe_03_08193-B-0040)
UH-HUH UH-HUH  (fe_03_08193-B-0041)

YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_08193-B-0043)
WELL NOT ONLY THAT BUT ESPECIALLY WITH HARRY POTTER IF HE'S THE ONLY KID THAT'S NOT ALLOWED TO READ THEM BOY THAT WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT  (fe_03_08193-B-0044)
GOOD  (fe_03_08193-B-0046)
I I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY WHAT EDUCATION'S ALL ABOUT IS IS BEING ABLE TO MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICES YOU KNOW EVEN AT YOU CAN'T JUST SAY OKAY I'M GOING TO WAIT TILL HE'S SIXTEEN AND THEN SAY 'NOW YOU CAN CHOOSE' YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TEACH THEM FROM THE EARLY DAYS THAT THEY CAN MAKE THOSE CHOICES  (fe_03_08193-B-0047)

GOOD  (fe_03_08193-B-0055)

IT'S A TRICKY ISSUE UM I AT MY SCHOOL [LAUGHTER] AT MY SCHOOL LAST YEAR WHICH WAS A SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADE SCHOOL THE HEALTH TEACHER WAS DOING THAT AND OF COURSE THE KIDS CAN GET ON THE INTERNET AND PULL OF PICTURES OF YOU KNOW WHO WHO KNOWS WHAT  (fe_03_08193-B-0057)
BUT AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE  (fe_03_08193-B-0058)
PROVIDED THEM LINKS OR RESOURCES OR WHATEVER BUT ONE ONE OF OUR TEACHERS THE KID CAME UP AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HOW  (fe_03_08193-B-0059)
HOW CAN A BABY GET OUT THIS LITTLE HOLE AND THEY SHOWED HIM THIS PICTURE OF THIS WOMAN'S VAGINA YOU KNOW FROM A PRIOR TO CHILDBEARING OR SOMETHING AND SO HERE'S THE T- YOU KNOW WE'RE TEACHERS WE'RE HUMAN TOO WE'RE NOT USED TO BEING CONFRONTED WITH PICTURES LIKE THAT OH WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF THIS  (fe_03_08193-B-0060)
SO IT'S HARD TO US FOR US TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PLAY IT COOL OR YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] OR GO OOPS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08193-B-0061)
IT IS A TOUCHY SUBJECT FOR I'M I'M GLAD WE'RE GETTING MORE CAN YOU COMPARE TO WHEN YOU WERE IN SCHOOL THINK HOW MUCH MORE THE KIDS ARE EITHER EXPOSED TO OR LEARN AT EARLY AGES YOU KNOW SO  (fe_03_08193-B-0062)
RIGHT BUT BUT YEAH IT'S THE THE INTERNET THING IS TALK ABOUT THE CENSORSHIP PROBLEM WITH THE LIBRARIES YOU I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT THE LIBRARIES ARE BEING ASKED TO LIKE PUT ON FILTERS THERE SO THE KIDS CAN'T LOOK AT PORNOGRAPHY ON THE INTERNET IN THE LIBRARIES  (fe_03_08193-B-0063)
YEAH I  (fe_03_08193-B-0064)
EX- I KNOW IT'S IT'S DING TO ME  (fe_03_08193-B-0065)

UH-HUH THAT'S WHAT I WAS WONDERING YEAH  (fe_03_08193-B-0073)
YEAH WELL YOU THOUGHT YOU YOU SOUND REALLY GOOD BECAUSE I I THINK GIVING KIDS THINGS THAT THEY JUST ARE TAKING FOR GRANTED GIVING THEM TO THEM AS PRIVILEGES REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE THAT'S AH IT'S MY MY VIEW TOO  (fe_03_08193-B-0074)
AND TO KEEP TRACK OF IT AND AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE KIND OF UNUSUAL TOO BECAUSE MOST PARENTS AREN'T ABLE TO SPEND THAT TIME OR THAT ENERGY TO DO THAT SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR DOING THAT  (fe_03_08193-B-0075)
GREAT  (fe_03_08193-B-0076)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH WHAT DID I I THOUGHT SAW SOMETHING ON OPRAH OR SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY ABOUT SOME  (fe_03_08193-B-0077)
PARENTS WHO WERE LIKE ALWAYS IN THEIR KIDS' FACE PAYING ATTENTION TO 'EM AND THEY SAID AT THE TIME  (fe_03_08193-B-0078)
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS HORRIBLE YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT AT WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ON THE SHOW THEY WERE LIKE TWENTY THREE AND THEY SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW THEY DO EVENTUALLY BUT IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THEM TO APPRECIATE  (fe_03_08193-B-0079)
RIGHT EXACTLY  (fe_03_08193-B-0080)
YEAH YEAH AND IT'S HARD IT'S A LONG ROAD AND I SEE THAT AS A MATH TEACHER I SEE THE SAME THINGS BECAUSE YOU KNOW KIDS A LOT OF KIDS DO NOT LIKE TO DO MATH  (fe_03_08193-B-0081)
BUT IF YOU DON'T MAKE 'EM DO IT THEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY WON'T HAVE THE SKILLS THEY NEED FOR THEIR FURTHER CLASSES AND SO YOU JUST HAVE TO NOT TAKE IT PERSONALLY AND SAY  (fe_03_08193-B-0082)
SORRY I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GONNA BE  (fe_03_08193-B-0083)
