UM  (fe_03_08185-B-0016)
MY H- MY AH EX HUSBAND AND I JUST WERE WE GREW UP YOU KNOW AS WE GREW OLDER WE GREW APART AND WE WE SINCERELY WANTED DIFFERENT THINGS IN LIFE AND I THINK IF  (fe_03_08185-B-0017)
PEOPLE WERE TO GO THROUGH SOME OF TYPE OF CLASSES OR TRAINING OR OR EVEN HAVE A BASIC QUESTIONNAIRE THAT THEY HAVE TO ANSWER BEFORE THEY GET MARRIED IT WOULD SOLVE A LOT OF THE DIVORCE PROBLEM  (fe_03_08185-B-0018)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_08185-B-0019)
YEAH  (fe_03_08185-B-0020)
YOU KNOW I THINK GO AHEAD  (fe_03_08185-B-0021)
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA  (fe_03_08185-B-0022)
I BECAUSE THE WHOLE FAMILY IS INVOLVED WHEN IT'S YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES DOWN  (fe_03_08185-B-0023)
AND I'M I'M AMAZED AT ALL THE PEOPLE THEY SPEND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON WEDDINGS AND THEN YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS LATER OR A YEAR LATER TWO YEARS LATER THEY'RE DIVORCED AND UM  (fe_03_08185-B-0024)
I I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO INHIBIT ME FROM GETTING MARRIED AGAIN WHEN I MEET THE RIGHT PERSON THOUGH  (fe_03_08185-B-0025)
UM BECAUSE I W- I I DO PLAN TO GET MARRIED AGAIN  (fe_03_08185-B-0026)
AND UM  (fe_03_08185-B-0027)
BUT I WILL TAKE THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW THE PERSON AND  (fe_03_08185-B-0028)
AND AH YOU KNOW KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT BEFORE I MAKE THAT COMMITMENT BECAUSE I DON'T EVER INTEND TO BE MA- TO BE DIVORCED AGAIN  (fe_03_08185-B-0029)
I WANT IT TO BE FOR LIFE  (fe_03_08185-B-0030)
I BELIEVE THAT MM  (fe_03_08185-B-0031)
SO YOU DO YOU DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE DIV- THAT THE DIVORCE RATE WOULD SCARE FROM YOU IF YOU WERE LET'S JUST SAY FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING GOD FORBID WOULD HAPPEN  (fe_03_08185-B-0032)
DO YOU THINK THE DIVORCE RATE WOULD WOULD EFFECT FROM YOU FROM  (fe_03_08185-B-0033)
MAKING THE DECISION TO GET MARRIED A THIRD TIME  (fe_03_08185-B-0034)
YOU WOULD NOT  (fe_03_08185-B-0035)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_08185-B-0036)
OH VERY INTERESTING  (fe_03_08185-B-0037)
SO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO TO DO WITH THE DIVORCE  (fe_03_08185-B-0038)
DIVORCE RATE IT JUST  (fe_03_08185-B-0039)
YOU DON'T  (fe_03_08185-B-0040)
SO YOU THAT DIVORCE HOW DID THAT AFFECT YOUR YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR  (fe_03_08185-B-0043)
YOUR VALUE YOUR THE WAY PEOPLE LOOKED AT YOU  (fe_03_08185-B-0044)
OH REALLY  (fe_03_08185-B-0046)
OH  (fe_03_08185-B-0047)
NOW HOW LONG WERE YOU MARRIED THE FIRST TIME  (fe_03_08185-B-0048)
FOUR YEARS OKAY  (fe_03_08185-B-0049)
[MN] WELL I WAS MARRIED FOR NINE AND I'VE GOT TWO CHILDREN  (fe_03_08185-B-0050)
AND UM  (fe_03_08185-B-0051)
AND WHEN I GOT DIVORCED I GUESS I WAS THE F- I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO GET MARRIED IN MY FAMILY AND THE FIRST ONE TO GET DIVORCED  (fe_03_08185-B-0052)
AND MY FAMILY AND I HAVE A VERY LARGE FAMILY  (fe_03_08185-B-0053)
AND UM  (fe_03_08185-B-0054)
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT MADE ME CLOSER TO MY FAMILY  (fe_03_08185-B-0055)
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY THOUGHT EVERYBODY SORT OF ALL PITCHED IN TO HELP OUT AND UM  (fe_03_08185-B-0056)
AND WERE GOOD A GOOD A GOOD SUPPORT TEAM  (fe_03_08185-B-0057)
I D- I DO BELIEVE UM  (fe_03_08185-B-0058)
THAT THE THE EASE OF DIVORCE HAS HURT  (fe_03_08185-B-0059)
THE TE- PEOPLE DON'T PEOPLE JUST DON'T TRY BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO EASY TO GET A DIVORCE JUST GO DOWN AND SIGN A PIECE OF PAPER  (fe_03_08185-B-0060)
AND YOU KNOW BASICALLY NO FAULT AND GOOD STUFF YOU KNOW IT JUST MAKES IT JUST WAY TOO EASY TO GET DIVORCED AND PEOPLE JUST GIVE UP TOO EASY WHEN THEY THEY IF THEY WORKED AT BECAUSE I MEAN MY GOSH WE DO SAY THESE VOWS YOU KNOW WE DO SAY  (fe_03_08185-B-0061)
UNTIL DEATH DO US PART AND THEN IT'S JUST IT'S LIKE WE FORGOT ABOUT THOSE SO [LAUGHTER] WE WE FORGET ABOUT THIS THOSE VOWS THAT WE SAID FOR RICHER FOR POORER IN SICKNESS AND HEALTH  (fe_03_08185-B-0062)
AH YOU KNOW GOOD TIMES AND BAD AND THEN WHEN AND WHEN THE BAD TIMES COME  (fe_03_08185-B-0063)
PEOPLE RUN THE OTHER WAY I THINK THAT DIVORCE IS NECESSARY SOMETIMES FOR EXAMPLE IF PEOPLE ARE BEING ABUSED YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT IT'S IT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE THERE'S NO REASON FOR SOMEBODY TO STAY IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS WHAT I WAS IN  (fe_03_08185-B-0064)
AND UM  (fe_03_08185-B-0065)
I BY GETTING TO KNOW SOMEBODY  (fe_03_08185-B-0066)
FOR A LONG TIME AND YOU KNOW KNOWING WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND SHARING THAT IT CAN IT CAN SOLVE A LOT OF THAT PROBLEM  (fe_03_08185-B-0067)
BEFORE IT EVEN GETS STARTED  (fe_03_08185-B-0068)
UH-HUH ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_08185-B-0069)
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN A- AN AGE IF WE GET MARRIED [LAUGHTER] TO BECAUSE WE WE HAVE TIME TO GROW AND THEN WE DON'T YOU KNOW THE D- AGAIN THE DIVORCE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE AS AS EASY WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU HAVE FOR  (fe_03_08185-B-0070)
VALUES WITH AND YOU KNOW A LIFE PLAN TOGETHER WITH  (fe_03_08185-B-0071)
AND AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE IS SOMETHING THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US AS PART OF OUR OUR OUR OUR BIRTHRIGHT  (fe_03_08185-B-0072)
AND THERE'S PURPOSE FOR MARRIAGE AND A AND IT'S LIKE YOU SAY ONE OF THE REASONS IS IS THAT WE PROCREATE  (fe_03_08185-B-0073)
AND AH I THINK TODAY SO MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN BOTHER  (fe_03_08185-B-0074)
TO GET MARRIED EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE KIDS OR THEY HAVE KIDS FIRST AND THEN GET MARRIED  (fe_03_08185-B-0075)
[MN] O-  (fe_03_08185-B-0076)
OR THEY DON'T EVEN YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE NOW NOWADAYS IT'S SO IT'S SO AFFECTED THAT PEOPLE JUST DON'T YOU KNOW THEY DON'T EVEN THINK TWICE ABOUT IT  (fe_03_08185-B-0077)
AND MAYBE AND I AND A LOT OF THEM USE THE THE REASON YOU KNOW AS THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THEY'VE WATCHED PARENTS GO THROUGH DIVORCE AND HOW HORRIBLE IT IS AND IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE HARDEST THING I EVER HAD TO DO IN MY LIFE  (fe_03_08185-B-0078)
WAS TO GO THROUGH A DIVORCE  (fe_03_08185-B-0079)
UM BECAUSE I DID I DID VERY MUCH AND IT'S REALLY TOUGH BEING AH SAYING GOODBYE AND ADMITTING THAT IT WAS A FAILURE  (fe_03_08185-B-0080)
OF COURSE YOU TRY TO BECAUSE THERE ARE KIDS INVOLVED YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO AH REMAIN MATURE ADULTS AND AND GET ALONG FOR THE KIDS' SAKE  (fe_03_08185-B-0081)
AND I THINK IT DOES AND GETTING BACK TO THE TO THE FAMILY VALUES THING I THINK THAT IT ABSOLUTELY DOES AH AFFECT  (fe_03_08185-B-0082)
THE WAY OUR KIDS GROW UP AND I'M LIKE YOU KNOW THEY WATCH THEIR MOMS AND DADS GET DIVORCED AND THEY THINK  (fe_03_08185-B-0084)
HEY YOU KNOW THIS IS MARRIAGE IS NOT SUCH A H- A A GREAT THING AFTER ALL BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT IT ISN'T IT ISN'T FOREVER IT ISN'T TI- TILL DEATH DO US PART SO  (fe_03_08185-B-0085)
MM AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE REASON WHY YOU KNOW TODAY PEOPLE I I I MEAN OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT'S DONE SO OFTEN DIVORCE IS SO PREVALENT WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS PEOPLE DON'T TRY  (fe_03_08185-B-0087)
IN MARRIAGES DO YOU THINK IT IS BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO EASY OR  (fe_03_08185-B-0088)
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_08185-B-0089)
