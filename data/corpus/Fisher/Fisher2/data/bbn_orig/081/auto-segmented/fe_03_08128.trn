BUT  (fe_03_08128-B-0015)
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF RAISING YOUR KID AND WATCHING OVER THEM AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND YOU HEAR THAT SECONDHAND SMOKE IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN ACTUALLY INHALING THE YOURSELF  (fe_03_08128-B-0016)
I I REALLY  (fe_03_08128-B-0017)
GET ANGRY AT PEOPLE WHO  (fe_03_08128-B-0018)
YOU KNOW SMOKE IN FRONT OF MY CHILD BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF LIKE OKAY IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT TO YOURSELF THAT'S FINE BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING YOUR SECONDHAND SMOKE  (fe_03_08128-B-0019)
ON THIS CHILD THAT I'VE RAISED AND KEPT SAFE FOR ALL THESE YEARS THEN IT BECOMES AN ISSUE WITH ME  (fe_03_08128-B-0020)

AND SO THAT WAS MY METHOD OF OF WHAT I DID WHEN I WAS STRESSED I WOULD TAKE A CIGARETTE OUT  (fe_03_08128-B-0025)
AND I IF THE CHILD DID NOT KNOW A DIFFERENT WAY TO HANDLE STRESS  (fe_03_08128-B-0026)
THAT'S THE FIRST WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LEARN TO USE NOW IF THEY'RE TAUGHT OTHER WAYS OF HANDLING STRESS THEN I THINK THAT EVEN IF THEY'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH SMOKERS THEY WILL WILL HAVE OTHER PATTERNS TO EMULATE  (fe_03_08128-B-0027)
WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UM THE BANS IN A LOT OF PLACES BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL A SMOKER  (fe_03_08128-B-0028)

THAT  (fe_03_08128-B-0052)
INSTANCE LIKE A HELMET LAW  (fe_03_08128-B-0054)
BUT WHEN YOU GO UP ONTO THE WARDS AND YOU SEE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T WEAR THEIR HELMETS THAT ARE NOW WARDS OF THE STATE AND IT'LL BE  (fe_03_08128-B-0055)

UM OF THE YOUNG BUT THERE'S VERY LITTLE BEEN SET ASIDE FOR HELPING OLDER SMOKERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE FACING LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES WITH OUR HELP  (fe_03_08128-B-0063)
