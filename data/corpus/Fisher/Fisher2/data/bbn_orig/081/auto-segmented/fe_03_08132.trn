HI MARY MY NAME IS SHERRY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08132-A-0001)
UM WELL THAT'S ONE OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS YOU HOPE YOU'RE NEVER FACED WITH  (fe_03_08132-A-0002)
I'D LIKE TO THINK I WOULD BE CALM BUT PROBABLY I WOULD BE TERRIFIED AND IN A PANIC  (fe_03_08132-A-0004)
AH ONE THING THAT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IS WHETHER I HAVE MY KIDS AROUND ME OR IF IT WAS JUST ME  (fe_03_08132-A-0005)
YEAH IT WOULD BE HARD TO ACCEPT  (fe_03_08132-A-0006)
MHM  (fe_03_08132-A-0007)
YEAH I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHETHER  (fe_03_08132-A-0008)
THERE WAS PHYSICAL TORTURE OR YOU KNOW YOUR LIFE WAS THREATENED  (fe_03_08132-A-0009)
IF IT WAS JUST PROPERTY YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING CAN BE REPLACED  (fe_03_08132-A-0010)
MAYBE IT'S EASIER TO TO MAINTAIN A CALM  (fe_03_08132-A-0011)
HAVE YOU TRAVELED VERY MUCH RECENTLY SINCE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS  (fe_03_08132-A-0012)

THEY MAKE YOU GO THROUGH AS FAR AS SCREENING AND YOU KNOW METAL DETECTORS AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING  (fe_03_08132-A-0020)
AND IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT EVEN AFTER ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS APPARENTLY THEY STILL HAVE PEOPLE TRYING TO BE INVENTIVE THAT CAN GET ON A PLANE AND AND HAVE OTHER WEAPONS OR YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08132-A-0021)
IT IT REALLY IS A FRIGHTENING THOUGHT  (fe_03_08132-A-0022)
YEAH  (fe_03_08132-A-0024)
WELL AND AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BOTHER ME THE VERY MOST ABOUT IT AND PROBABLY WHY I'D BE THE MOST TERRIFIED IS BECAUSE USUALLY THE TERRORISTS ARE COWARDS AND THEY'RE NOT ATTACKING  (fe_03_08132-A-0025)
WHO THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH LIKE THE GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT YOU KNOW THEY THEY PICK ON INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE THEIR GRIEVANCES AND PROBLEMS  (fe_03_08132-A-0026)
