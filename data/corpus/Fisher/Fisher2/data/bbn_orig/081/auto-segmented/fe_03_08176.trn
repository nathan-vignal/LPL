ALTERED BEHAVIORS  (fe_03_08176-B-0011)
UM  (fe_03_08176-B-0012)
I AM A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AND I GUESS ONE AREA WHERE I KNOW I HAVE HAD TO ALTER MY BEHAVIOR IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY SENSITIVE  (fe_03_08176-B-0013)
TO CHILDREN AND YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY NEVER ASSUME THAT THAT CHILD IS COMING FROM AN INTACT HOME  (fe_03_08176-B-0014)

RIGHT RIGHT YEAH  (fe_03_08176-B-0022)
WELL I AGREE AND I THINK MORE AND MORE OF OUR CHURCHES ARE GETTING INTO THAT WHERE YOU ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE CLASSES AND YOU ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A LEVEL OF COMPATIBILITY  (fe_03_08176-B-0023)
AND UM REQUIRED TO DISCUSS HOT POINT ISSUES THAT ALWAYS CROP UP WITHIN A MARRIAGE  (fe_03_08176-B-0024)
AND I THINK THAT'S A A VERY GOOD THING  (fe_03_08176-B-0025)
AND I TOO UM I AM DIVORCED MYSELF AND UM I HATE IT UM IT IS THE MOST SINGLE DEVASTATING THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME  (fe_03_08176-B-0026)

UM  (fe_03_08176-B-0035)
BUT AS FAR AS HAS IT ALTERED MY VIEW OF THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE I WOULD SAY I I VALUE AND TREASURE THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE MORE AS AN OLDER ADULT THAN I EVER DID AS A YOUNGER PERSON  (fe_03_08176-B-0036)
JUST BECAUSE I HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW LOVE DEEPENS  (fe_03_08176-B-0037)
AS YOU GO THROUGH LIFE  (fe_03_08176-B-0038)
WITH YOUR UM SPOUSE  (fe_03_08176-B-0039)

NO NO DEFINITELY NOT AND [SIGH] UM YEAH AND I REALLY THINK YOU KNOW THAT AS AS THE UM  (fe_03_08176-B-0041)
INSTITUTION OF A MARRIAGE IF IT CONTINUES TO BREAK DOWN I I BELIEVE IT HAS NATIONWIDE CONSEQUENCES  (fe_03_08176-B-0042)

MM NO IT ISN'T  (fe_03_08176-B-0056)
RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_08176-B-0057)
YEAH AND THERE'S THIS FUNNY ATTITUDE THAT IF YOU LIVE TOGETHER YOU CAN TEST THE MARRIAGE AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE SUITED FOR MARRIAGE  (fe_03_08176-B-0058)
AND YOU KNOW THE NATIONAL STATISTICS ON THAT ARE THAT  (fe_03_08176-B-0059)
UM THE DIVORCE RATE IS HIGHER AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED TOGETHER BEFORE MARRIAGE THERE IS ALSO MORE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AMONG THOSE COUPLES AND THERE'S A HIGHER RATE OF DEPRESSION  (fe_03_08176-B-0060)
OH  (fe_03_08176-B-0061)

I THINK THERE MUST BE A CERTAIN UM  (fe_03_08176-B-0064)
COULD THERE BE A LOSS OF RESPECT  (fe_03_08176-B-0065)
BOTH FOR YOUR PARTNER AND MAYBE FOR YOURSELF I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_08176-B-0066)
