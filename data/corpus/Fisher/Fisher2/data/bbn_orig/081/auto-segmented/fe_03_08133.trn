WHEREVER THE SAFETY COMMITTEE WHOEVER IT IS YOU KNOW FEDERAL SAFETY COMMITTEE OR SOMETHING SAID THAT WE NEED A HUNDRED A HUNDRED BILLION MORE DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO COMBAT TERRORISM  (fe_03_08133-A-0029)

I DON'T LIKE TO PUT A PRICE ON LIFE BUT THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THOSE LIVES AND MEANWHILE IF YOU TOOK THAT HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS AND WE PUT IT INTO EDUCATION OR INTO SOMETHING  (fe_03_08133-A-0032)

ALL THESE THINGS YOU'RE TALKING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THINGS THAT LIKE IN TEN YEARS OR FIVE YEARS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE REPLACED ANYHOW AND MAY NEVER GET USED SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM EDUCATION OR PROGRAMS  (fe_03_08133-A-0039)
THAT COULD REALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND SO I MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT IF WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT OH MY GOSH A METEOR'S GOING TO LIKE HIT SOMEWHERE ON THE PLANET AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ALL PREPARE SO WE SHOULD START LIKE BUILDING CAVES UNDERGROUND OR SOMETHING I MEAN  (fe_03_08133-A-0040)

BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE NOT ADULTS THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME THINKING SKILLS THE SAME RATIONALE THE SAME ABILITY TO PROBLEM SOLVE OR TO PUT THINGS IN A PERSPECTIVE  (fe_03_08133-A-0061)
