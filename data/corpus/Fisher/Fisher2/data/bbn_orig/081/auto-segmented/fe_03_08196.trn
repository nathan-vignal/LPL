UM I I'M A RETIRED SCHOOL TEACHER SO AH YOU KNOW UM [LIPSMACK] SETTING UP  (fe_03_08196-A-0003)
CENSORSHIP ON WHAT CHILDREN READ IS IS A TOPIC THAT I'M INTERESTED IN  (fe_03_08196-A-0004)
BUT UM AS UM AS A TEACHER I KNOW THAT AH  (fe_03_08196-A-0005)
WE'RE THERE TO HELP CHILDREN AH MOLD THEIR CHARACTER AND SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN REAL BIG ON  (fe_03_08196-A-0006)
CHARACTER BUILDING AND SO TO ME WE NEED BOOKS AH IN THOSE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR I'M A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER PARTICULARLY THAT WILL HELP THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND PRACTICE  (fe_03_08196-A-0007)
PRACTICE DEMOCRATIC UM PRINCIPLES  (fe_03_08196-A-0008)
AND SO TO ME AH BOOKS THAT AH TEAR DOWN THAT KIND OF AH CHARACTER BUILDING UM YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE NEED TO  (fe_03_08196-A-0009)
SAVE THOSE FOR THOSE HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE STUDENTS AFTER THEIR CHARACTER'S ALREADY BEEN FORMED  (fe_03_08196-A-0010)
YEAH MHM [LIPSMACK] SO AH YOU KNOW AH THERE'S JUST SOME BOOKS THAT I THINK THAT ARE LATER  (fe_03_08196-A-0011)
TO BE READ LATER NOT NOT REAL EARLY IN LIFE  (fe_03_08196-A-0012)
MHM  (fe_03_08196-A-0015)
OH I I TOTALLY AGREE MATTER OF FACT I I THINK THAT ALL SCHOOLS AND OUR SCHOOL DID  (fe_03_08196-A-0016)
HAVE AN ADVISORY BOARD AH AND IT CONSISTED OF NOT ONLY YOU KNOW A TEACHER FACULTY MEMBER BUT A STUDENT  (fe_03_08196-A-0017)
YOU KNOW OF THAT SCHOOL AH THE PRINCIPAL NATURALLY THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR AH THE LIBRARIAN AH MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND A PARENTS UM YOU KNOW OF STUDENTS AT THAT SCHOOL  (fe_03_08196-A-0018)
AND SO OH YES I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE IN THE LEFT IN THE HANDS OF A SMALL JUST ELITE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS GOOD FOR OUR KIDS OR NOT GOOD FOR OUR KIDS MHM YEAH  (fe_03_08196-A-0019)
YEAH BUT AH I THINK THAT SOMETIMES WHEN UM  (fe_03_08196-A-0020)
WE WE NEED THERE TO HAVE AS WIDE A SELECTION OF BOOKS YOU KNOW FOR CHILDREN TO READ AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEIR INTEREST IS SO VARIED  (fe_03_08196-A-0021)
YEAH  (fe_03_08196-A-0022)
BUT AH I I REMEMBER YEARS AGO IN THE UM YOU KNOW SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN SOME OF THE BOOKS THAT WERE BEING PUT INTO ELEMENTARY OF MIDDLE SCHOOL WAS JUST  (fe_03_08196-A-0023)
KNOW IT IT DID NOT MEET THE COMMUNITY STANDARDS  (fe_03_08196-A-0025)
AND AH SO THEREFORE TO ME YOU KNOW CENSORSHIP SHOULD SHOULD WORK UM ON A COMMUNITY BASIS NOT ON A NATIONWIDE YOU KNOW WHAT  (fe_03_08196-A-0026)
I UM I WOULD REALLY  (fe_03_08196-A-0028)
LEAD MY CHILDREN TO TO READ REALLY WHOLESOME  (fe_03_08196-A-0029)
BOOKS  (fe_03_08196-A-0030)
THAT REALLY AH BUILT THEM UP AND MADE THEM MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN TEAR THEM DOWN  (fe_03_08196-A-0031)
YEAH  (fe_03_08196-A-0032)
I LIKE THAT IDEA MHM I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_08196-A-0033)
YES YOU KNOW JUST LIKE ON RECORDS HAVE A WARNING OR HAVE A RATING LIKE ON MOVIES IN VIDEOS ON RECORDS AH ON ON AH YOU KNOW WHAT THE MUSIC AND ALSO NOW YES ON BOOKS  (fe_03_08196-A-0034)
BUT YOU KNOW UM I DO HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO ARE LIBRARIANS AND THEY REALLY DO AH YOU KNOW SELECT SOME REALLY GOOD BOOKS FOR THE KIDS TO READ THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING  (fe_03_08196-A-0035)
AND REALLY YOU KNOW FUN TO READ AND THE P- T- AH AH APPROPRIATE AGE LEVELS I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TOO IS THAT THE BOOKS  (fe_03_08196-A-0036)
IN IN OUR SCHOOL LIBRARY FOR EXAMPLE FIT THE AGE LEVEL OF THE READER  (fe_03_08196-A-0037)
AND AND THAT ALONE WILL HELP TO AH CONTROL SOME BOOKS THAT WOULD BE NOT APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW OR ACCEPTABLE AND THEN IT TO ME IT BOILS DOWN TO PARENTS  (fe_03_08196-A-0038)
NOW THEY'RE JUST STARTING BOOKS YES I MEAN I DON'T KNOW DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN  (fe_03_08196-A-0039)
I DON'T EITHER AND BUT I'M TELLING YOU THAT THERE WAS JUST CERTAIN BOOKS THAT I THAT I WOULD NOT PERMIT MY CHILDREN TO READ IN OUR HOUSEHOLD SIMPLY BECAUSE IT  (fe_03_08196-A-0040)
I MEAN IF I DON'T GO AROUND CURSING I ALL THE TIME AND SWEARING ALL THE TIME WHY SHOULD I HAVE BOOKS IN THE MY YOU KNOW THAT MY STUDENT BRINGS HOME FROM THE LIBRARY THAT IS FULL OF THAT  (fe_03_08196-A-0041)
MHM SO I THINK IT BEGINS REALLY WITH THE PARENT AND BUT I STILL THINK WE TEACHERS HAVE A GREAT ROLE IN AH HELPING PARENTS TO AH SHAPE THE CHARACTER THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE AS ADULTS  (fe_03_08196-A-0042)
AND UM  (fe_03_08196-A-0043)
