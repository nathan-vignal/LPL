R:  Hi, this is Susan.
L:  Hi, Susan.  My name's Kimberley.
R:  Hi, Kimberley.  How are you doing tonight?
L:  Good, thank you.
R:  Good.  So, we're supposed to talk about drug testing?
L:  Yep, that's what he said [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, would you like to start, or would you like me to start?
L:  Ah, either way's fine with me.  I ah I have some strong opinions about it, but, you know --
R:  Then, go ahead.
L:  No, I just ah I -- I think it's a great idea.
R:  Okay.  What makes i- what makes it a great idea for ya?
L:  Well, um, especially if it's ah a business that deals with safety issues --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, somebody on drugs can either get hurt, or hurt other people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and um I just really don't think if they have to have them prescriptionwise or unprescription, they need to be at work with them.  And that -- that -- that is something you do, if you're going to have drugs in your system, you should do it at home.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I know that um -- I've worked for the same company for a long time and right after I had my child I was the only person in my department, so the computer kept randomly pulling me, since I was the only person in that department.  That was a little annoying --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I had to go for a drug test, you know, like every two weeks --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And I was breast feeding, so I certainly wasn't taking drugs, but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- finally I said something to 'em and they had to pull me out because I was employee number one and that was the only --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's a flaw in some of the systems they make up.
R:  Right.  Was that a urine test that you had to take?
L:  Um, it was urine and blood.  They did a double dose on ya.
R:  Oh, my God.  Urine and blood.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  And um, so I -- I was just real annoyed about that, but otherwise I think it's a fabulous idea and there's a lot of people that, you know, think they're going to get by doing their drugs on company time [LAUGH] and I really don't think they do it enough in enough companies, to be honest --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- with ya.
R:  Hm. [PAUSE]
L:  You have my opinion [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, my opinion is that um if you're in a position that ah encumbers or bears on the public safety that ah it is okay to do random drug tests ah and assuming you were hired with the understanding that that would be done -- in other words, it's not a policy I would spring on people, I would let 'em know from the time they hire in or, you know, from the time you institute the policy, that this is going --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- to be occurring.
L:  That's a good one.
R:  And that ah know that you will be susceptible to that.  I -- I don't -- I don't think it is a good thing to do in general because I get very concerned about the civil liberties aspects of it and that any kind of encroachment on what we do in our own time is not something that I think the government has any right to do ah again unless they're public safety issues.  And there's certain drugs that stay in your system, so even if you are not affected by them at work, they have a shelf life in your blood or your urine --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whatever.  So, you might, say, smoke marijuana on the weekend, be perfectly sober at work and um -- but it would show up in your system.  And I -- I just have um --
L:  Well, that just tells you that it's not as free drug as people think.  If it stays in your system that long --
R:  Oh it d- it definitely stays in your system, ah but if it's not impairing your work, or if you're not in a position again where I think safety is involved --
L:  I don't know.  I don't -- I don't know that I believe it doesn't impair your work, even up to that time.  I mean, just because you don't feel it, um, I've -- I've watched people ruin their lives over drugs.
R:  Yeah, they're -- they're --
L:  -- and in that particular drug.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  I -- you -- you mean marijuana?
L:  -- so I um, I can't say that I believe it doesn't impair you at all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even after you don't feel the effects of it anymore.
R:  Well, see, I think what gets tricky about that is -- and while drugs are not appealing to me personally, its -- and I mean, I'm fifty five years old and it is simply not something I do -- but --
L:  Well, I -- they got us there, I'm forty two, so --
R:  There you go, well, um, you know --
L:  Yeah.  We're -- we're over our drug days.
R:  If I had -- if I had a misspent youth, I'd be old enough to be your mother, but ah --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But -- but I think that, you know, to me the civil liberties issues are really important and, you know, where do you draw the line?  I mean, they don't tr- trust -- I'm sorry, they don't test for alcohol, for instance, and alcohol --
L:  Okay.  Well, what if we -- what if we did this?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What if we made it, that particular drug, legal, but it's not legal to be in your blood at work?  Because --
R:  Which -- which ah -- which drug?
L:  -- they feel the same way I do, that maybe it'd impair you.
R:  Yes, see --
L:  Um, marijuana in particular, because that does have a shelf life in your blood, like you said.
R:  Yeah, I th- I think it's a fairly long time, even.  And other things mimic it, like, you know, poppy seeds.  Like, if you're a poppy seed bagel person --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that poppy seeds will look like marijuana --
L:  I had no idea of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, I'm a psychologist and I've dealt with this with clients and people have tested positive that weren't positive and they go through these rigmaroles with it and you stop eating your poppy seed bagels, but I -- I mean, there -- there are many things that impair people's functioning, people don't sleep right, people stay out late partying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, people drink, they drink at lunch, um, there -- there --
L:  Yeah.  And see, that's a -- that's another thing that --
R:  -- there -- there are lots of things --
L:  I don't think that's supposed to happen [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  And people don't take good care of themselves.  And -- and it's just a question of where to me where do you draw a line and where do you say to people, "You're adult."  Now, here's the deal.  If someone does something then, that's like a problem at work and they've got something illegal in their system, to me they're culpable at that point.  But I think to have -- especially blood tests -- I don't know about you, but I'm real squeamish about that, I hate needles, I mean it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a urine test is one thing.
L:  Well, I didn't like it 'cause, um, I was one of those people, whenever they took any amount of money -- ah, blood out of me it made -- it made me feel it, in some way I got really tired --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whenever I gave blood ah it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- took me a while to recoup.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- I d- I don't know that that amount, but they usually took out three vials when they -- when they check --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- your blood, with this particular company.
R:  I mean, I'm -- I'm a major wuss, the sheer taking of the blood is something that I got to look away and cl- -- I've actually fainted when my blood was taken.  Now, that was a long time ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I just -- I mean, there -- there's that -- that whole dialectic of the individual rights and then the communal well being, but I think -- I think one of the really strong things we have as Americans is -- is the idea of personal liberty, which is not the same thing as personal license --
L:  You know what, I totally agree with you and I understand, you know, that line.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then there is that line of people that don't know when to quit.
R:  Well, that's really true.
L:  Unfortunately --
R:  That -- that --
L:  -- there are so much of the other end of that in America [LAUGH] we over indulge --
R:  Well [MN] --
L:  -- in food and alcohol --
R:  Well, see, exactly.  Exactly.
L:  -- drugs.  And you've got to have somebody say, "You gotta stop" [LAUGH].
R:  Well, br- -- see, I don't know that you can say, "You gotta stop", or my opinion is I think you can show people --
L:  Yeah, you can ruin your life, just don't ruin anybody else's.
R:  -- you can show the point of it.  Like, I'm a very health conscious person.  I really try and eat healthy and I'm aware, like if I eat junk, I feel differently in my body.  I'm very aware of it.  But -- and, you know, I'm sort of evangelistic about it.  But you can't make -- well, I don't -- I don't even think you should be --
L:  I am because I have sugar instability, so I don't eat it.
R:  See, yeah.  S- --
L:  And when I do [MN] so I can --
R:  And you know what it does.
L:  But -- well, I can also tell you that I know -- I know school teachers that smoke pot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm one of those people that couldn't even walk in a room without feeling it.
R:  Right.
L:  And so I didn't appreciate it when somebody would just invite me over to their house and think, just assume --
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean I realize that that should be their freedom, but they should warn me as well.  Pot smokers here. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, yeah.  And, you know, they're actually taking a risk in even doing that in front of you, if they don't know what your own interest is.
L:  Well -- yeah.  Well, then there's -- then there's the other thing, ah, you know, it's my blood at that point and I've got to prove I didn't smoke it.
R:  How about that?  See, that -- that's a really interesting point.  And I don't know that there's many people around that don't know what pot smells like --
L:  Oh, I know.  It's raunchy.
R:  -- but can you imagine -- can you imagine what it's like if you're actually like at a party somewhere and you are so naive that you don't even know what it smells like and you get tested and you get busted on the fact that you had the secondhand smoke from someone?  You know, I just think -- I think it's very tricky.  But ah -- but I think clearly, for people like operating buses, trains, ah police --
L:  Airplanes.
R:  -- firemen, you know -- airplanes.
L:  Operating period.
R:  Yeah.  You know, I -- I think they d- even -- it doesn't even seem like they enforce the laws that are on the books that well.  I mean, remember the thing about the airline pilots, what was it?  A few months ago, they were like completely bombed.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  On alcohol and -- and I think they got turned in by some -- because they were drinking all night.  And they were --
L:  Somebody saw 'em, yeah --
R:  -- going in --
L:  -- and they were supposed to fly the next morning.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  And, you know --
L:  Well, that's what -- there is a perfect example right there of somebody that doesn't know when to quit, when it's going to affect somebody else in their life --
R:  And -- and that to me --
L:  -- and don't care.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  That's like plain crazy.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  I totally agree.  I mean, they don't care.  And obviously no -- they don't respect their own life, so [LAUGH] --
R:  No, it doesn't appear in --
L:  So they -- they can't be told, "Okay, you can do it, whenever you want" [LAUGH].
R:  No and --
L:  And not be tested.
R:  Right.  Right.  And that actually is illegal and those folks did it anyway.  But, yeah, I forget how it was that they got busted.  I mean, it's just a good thing they did get busted.
L:  I ah yeah, I think you were right, that somebody saw 'em.  I -- I think that I remember that or --
R:  They were in a bar all night.
L:  -- that was a different --
R:  And that was against regulations, you know, folks like that.  I mean, I don't know whether they were actually alcoholics or, you know, in terms of --
L:  Had some trauma in their life.
R:  -- yeah, but I mean either way --
L:  Some people lean towards that when they have other things going
