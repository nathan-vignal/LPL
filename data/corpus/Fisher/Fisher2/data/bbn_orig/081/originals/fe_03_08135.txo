L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you see it on television when it -- when it -- when it went up -- when they did the Twin Towers, did you see it?
L:  Yes, I was watching --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the news that morning.  Yes, I was watching the news and when that second plane hit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I knew right away --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and I told my sister, "There's gonna be a war".
R:  Well, my brother um called me because someone come riding into work, saw all the smoke and she told me to um, you know, turn it on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when I saw it ah, to tell you the truth, I didn't believe my eyes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I did not believe what I saw --
L:  I know.
R:  -- I said, "I know Pearl Harbor" --
L:  I know.
R:  -- I even got that for years back um the Pearl Harbor I saw ah I heard that, but I was in school then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then my husband went into the war, my -- my brother was in that war and then my neighbor next door was in that war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I said I couldn't believe that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we could have something like this happen again in this country.  A- and we won- I wonder how these things --
L:  I know.
R:  -- how these people --
L:  In this country.
R:  -- could do things like that.  Now, right now, we -- I live near um -- um -- between um a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] airport and um and um they said they planned something there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but what are they going to st- I mean, tell me something.  When are people gonna get rid of these kind of people?
L:  That's -- 
R:  You know.
L:  I don't think they ever will.
R:  I know.
L:  I don't really think that they --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're going about it the right way --
R:  Yes.  For something like that --
L:  You know, I think they should have been --
R:  -- to happen.  I mean --
L:  -- more aggressive --
R:  I -- I mean in this --
L:  -- from the very beginning --
R:  -- country with the security --
L:  -- instead of waiting till --
R:  -- you know, we have and training and like I said --
L:  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  -- when Pearl Harbor came I was in high school.  They took --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- every eighteen and nineteen year old boy out of the school.  I had no boys in the school when I graduated.  I only met --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my husband after the war.  And I never --
L:  I know.
R:  -- went out with anybody, we had nobody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even when we graduated.  We had [inaudible] with girls.  So, I mean -- they made --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something like that that happened so many years ago, you'd think they would be prepared --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for anything that could happen and I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and it's something when somebody's, I don't know, who's fault it is, I mean I don't really know.  I mean, ah w- w- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean we -- we have to let everybody into this country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they come here and they [several inaudible words] because everything is freedom and you'd think they'd be happy about that, where they're coming from.  But no.
L:  For freedom?  Yeah. [PAUSE] Right.  Well, they're coming from the other countries that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to me I feel that um they knew this was going to happen way before it happened.
R:  I know.
L:  And you'd think they --
R:  Right.  And that's it --
L:  -- would have been on alert more --
R:  -- no, that's [inaudible] a lot of people feel --
L:  -- because they did know, they even said they --
R:  -- oh and this country nothing's gonna happen --
L:  -- knew it was going to happen.
R:  -- nothing could happen.  They felt --
L:  They were told it was gonna happen.
R:  -- I think too lax and at places where we have to be --
L:  But they didn't know where or when --
R:  -- a little more, you know effective.  There's where our problem is.  Anybody could get on and they'd bring anything on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they could do anything, back and forth --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and even when things aren't going good, you still could get a --
L:  Aggressive with ah --
R:  -- g- get -- go --
L:  -- security.
R:  -- across, or they could come here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Even when times are bad.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE]
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE] Right, which they did.
L:  Right.
R:  And all the people that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that died, my daughter has two of them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- had his daughter died --
L:  Well, they've done what they accomplished --
R:  -- she was talking on the phone --
L:  -- was to --
R:  -- she got -- and ah we don't -- I don't --
L:  -- scare the people --
R:  -- too far away from the Twin Towers --
L:  -- and to bring the prices and their employment --
R:  -- and finally ah --
L:  -- and everything --
R:  -- this girl that worked inside the Twin Towers, she's okay, but she just only got a job recently --
L:  Mhm.
R:  She couldn't get a job --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and working like seventeen, eighteen years.  And what do you think about that?  Now, what is gonna be?  Are we all going to go -- now go cl- check on me, our money that our taxes that we pay, we have to give them checks now?  So, ah -- all in all --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I think it's just a mess --
L:  No.
R:  -- and I think they oughta get --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some kind of um --
L:  That's terrible.
R:  -- ah people that's --
L:  Right --
R:  -- knowledgeable and people that really want to make this country the way it was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I don't know how long it's gonna take --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  Not when we have the -- [inaudible] yeah [PAUSE] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  It'll never be the way it was.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, um, I'm sixty one years old --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I remember back --
R:  And where do you live again, you told me?
L:   -- when --
R:  Where are you now?
L:  -- you know, you could go out in the streets, you could walk down the street in dark and um --
R:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.  I live out --
L:  -- you weren't afraid of anything.
R:  -- here near um -- I live out in --
L:  -- you know, but nowadays --
R:  -- [inaudible] Long Island, but I was raised --
L:  -- you don't know who you can trust and who you can't --
R:  -- in Queens and I used to go ride with the fifty ninety bridge and always into the city and then --
L:  Oh, in [inaudible] Dusky, it's about --
R:  -- I came out to Long Island --
L:  -- thirty five miles from Cleveland --
R:  -- and ah we used to as young girls, like --
L:  -- Ohio.
R:  -- we used to go to dances --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in a group and nothing ever happened.  I -- I mean when I hear -- nothing, now we walked home, we walk -- we didn't have cars, we came on the subway --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- we went out on a subway at night -- I mean I don't [inaudible] out at night -- but we were out a few hours, you know, no longer than two o'clock and ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thank God, I mean, I'm --
L:  Un-uh.
R:  -- I -- I -- I felt safe.  And now when my daughter goes some place or my son, or my granddaughter --
L:  No, I know.
R:  -- I don't know what [inaudible] what come back, what's gonna happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If they go traveling on -- on the railroad or anything like that.
L:  No.
R:  I don't know, I just -- I don't even know if we -- we need -- people that went through this could really help, you know, this um what going on, we don't even do things --
L:  You're scared.
R:  -- [inaudible] where we could help somebody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but let them know that we better get a little more on the ball here --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and not, you know, let these things happen and let these people --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- just get in here without, you know, really check 'em out.
L:  It's just --
R:  I -- I do feel very bad and the Twin Towers, I know I felt bad with Pearl Harbor --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but this hit me more because I was affected because even my son worked around that neighborhood --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and what he had to do in order to get home, luckily he did, he had to go over the fifty nine street bridge, walk over there -- they had to walk over the [inaudible] bridge --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then get trains --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to go to Long Island, whilst they were able to.  It was very, very, very sad and bad --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and people I don't know how many people we know that maybe talked to people have died and really close to, you know, us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are, you know, [inaudible] and children and grandchildren, or whatever they are, somebody always knew somebody that could do something about it.  And the only thing I can think about it is that if all of us, like you and I and all of us that we hear of anything that's not going right and tell them, we could write right away and voice our opinions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think sometimes that might help --
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  -- to get a group.  Like [several inaudible words] do you belong to the [inaudible]?
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  Yeah.  When I go to the --
L:  They know somebody.
R:  -- meetings they honestly tell us, you know, when things are going wrong, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all the [inaudible] write to them, ask their or whatever it is that bothers you and you can k- have to keep doing that, us, because we don't -- they don't hear from us something like that, they'll just whoever's in charge, like everybody else, like they go and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do what they want to do, because they're groups, monopoly, we're nothing.  And we're the ones that pay all the taxes.
L:  Yes, I do.  Yes.  I do.
R:  Right?  We pay for everything we get.  I mean, even our social security t- I mean all of a sudden, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they give you one -- they give it to you one -- the next minute they're -- they've got to take away the [inaudible].  You can't go -- you can't get any help from them.  They're trying, right, Medicare, they're trying to get us something, I don't know what they're going to give us, I don't know what it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're always talking.  Always talking.  But I don't [inaudible] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- anybody doing anything.  So, I think that --
L:  Right.  Answer.
R:  -- the best thing for us to do is sit down and write letters and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- call, phone calls and get started on what we deserve --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and like I said, my husband --
L:  I know.
R:  -- was um [inaudible] more now to do with -- was your husband in the service?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  He was in the service, he was in Germany --
L:  Un-uh.
R:  -- and they picked him to ah drop all men that were w- were fighting there ah food supplies.
L:  Right.
R:  So, he could have been shot down, I mean I'm lucky --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- lucky like -- I didn't know him and [several inaudible words] so they gave him a medal, okay?  So, what does this medal mean, I mean really?  If you go to the school, the veterans and [inaudible] about it or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they won't even acknowledge it.  They'll give you a certificate.
L:  No, my husband wasn't.
R:  Who needs this?  But if you say that he risked his life or something like that.  Is that right?  No.  I -- they don't get r- no recognition and then [inaudible].  I was really proud of it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I told everybody about him.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  I do, I got the medal, I got his picture --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- made -- I didn't know him, they put his little thing in the paper, you know, and ah --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and that's about it.
L:  Right. [PAUSE]  Mhm.  [PAUSE] No. [PAUSE] R- [PAUSE] Mhm.  [PAUSE] No, it isn't.  [PAUSE] Oh yeah.  [PAUSE] Mhm.  [PAUSE] Mhm.
