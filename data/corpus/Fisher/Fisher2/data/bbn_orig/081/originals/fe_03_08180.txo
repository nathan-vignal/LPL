R:  Hi, my name is Tony.
L:  Oh, hi, my name is Penny.
R:  Penny?
L:  Pen- -- like the coin.
R:  Penny, okay.  Hi, Penny.
L:  Hi.  How are you, Tony?
R:  Uh, I'm not doing too bad.
L:  Uh, well --
R:  Where are you located?
L:  I'm in Portland, Oregon.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in, uh, living in Ohio.  
L:  Oh, gee --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- okay.  
R:  Yeah, I guess we just have to talk about family values and I heard her say about the divorce rate, but I couldn't catch the rest of it.  It was kind of very --
L:  Yeah, [MN] it was something about how the divorce rate in America has changed your way of thinking about marriage, or changed your [MN] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- views of the institution of marriage.
R:  Okay, well, that makes sense.
L:  I think that's what it said.
R:  Okay --
L:  So --
R:  -- well, I -- you know, I think family values are very important myself.  I'm a single person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, never been married and I can attest to the fact that, you know, the divorce rate in -- in a lot of my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- friends, seeing them get married, divorced, get divorced again [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it really has, uh, made a difference in my decision to really not get married, because of the -- the sc- -- you know, I'm scared that I would -- that would happen to me.
L:  So, you think you'll never get married as a result, or are you just being extremely cautious?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I -- I possibly would, you know, would get married at some point.  But I -- at this time, I'm kinda leaning toward not.  [SIGH] Um, I just see so many people [MN], you know, getting divorced and I -- my family values are that if I was to get married --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that was -- that would be something that I would not wanna do.  That would be the absolute last resort.
L:  Well, uh, I'm -- I'm actually a divorced person, and -- and I think [SIGH], you know, and I believe very much, actually, in family values, and I do think that there is a place for divorce.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I do think that people make it a bit too easy.  Um, you know --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- to be happy and -- you know, and -- I mean, of -- of course, you know, I don't [inaudible] the notion that happiness is an important value, but I do think it's not that simple to achieve no matter what your marital status is, [SIGH] and I certainly think that [MN], you know, uh, relationships are difficult.  So, if you're not willing to work at them, then they're not going to work.  And I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I feel very badly for my children, frankly.  I have two -- [several inaudible words] their father has remarried and he has three little ones[?] and my girls are college, so --
R:  Are they?
L:  -- [several inaudible words] [SIGH] but, you know, it was terrible for them.  But, you know, what's so great -- [several inaudible words] they've been forced to have to deal with all sorts of stuff because of the failure of their parents, and I feel terrible about it.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, because it wasn't easy for them to go between houses and [MN] -- in fact, my youngest was just [inaudible] she's my -- my -- recently moved to Washington D.C. [SIGH] and she's living with him this summer and doing, uh, working in D.C. and --
R:  Uh, okay.
L:  -- she's telling me that she's having a recurrent nightmare about her -- where she's yelling at her stepmo- -- she's never really lived with them before, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just for weekends, so this is like the longest time [inaudible] with 'em.  She says she has these nightmares where she's screaming at her stepmother, telling her all the things [MN] that she's ever done [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and so I -- you know, I think that, um, your -- your -- your perception that it is -- it is a serious business, um, and [several inaudible words] and that, uh, [SIGH] and -- and your, uh, reservations about doing it I think are -- are very smart.  But I do hope that, you know, 'cause I believe in marriage, I believe in family, I believe in having children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just think that people should take it seriously.  Don't, you know, [MN] -- I mean, d- don't --
R:  Right, and -- and I agree.
L:  -- get married if you're not willing to work hard at it.
R:  Right.  My family values are that I would -- like, for instance, I would love to have kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I would never do this, and I know it's re- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- done regularly now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is to have kids out of marriage.  But to me that would be something that I would never wanna do, so [SIGH] [MN] it's -- it's just kind of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- tough call.  Now, your -- does your other child live near you?
L:  No.  Both of my girls are actually -- uh, well, right now, they're both going to be on the East Coast.  My youngest is going to college at the University of Pennsylvania and my oldest is working at University of Maryland.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, that's hard.  I mean, it's nice for them, as in their dad has recently moved to the East Coast, since both of them are there, [several inaudible words] nearby, but -- but, um, I mean, there's the whole other thing about family in America is com- complicated enough.   Uh, they love Portland, like, it's a great place.  Have you ever -- you ever been here?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  It's really, it's -- I'm from the East Coast originally, and -- and I just -- I love Portland, it's a beautiful city and it was a great place for my kids to grow up.  And they feel that very much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- having spent time on the East Coast now.  Not that they don't like it, but they really love Portland [inaudible].
R:  How long have you been -- where on the East Coast did you live?
L:  I -- well, I grew up in New York, but I lived in D.C. --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- before we moved out here, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't like D.C. at all, you know, and it's --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- it's a very artificial place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I'm very interested in government, but it's very artificial and people take it much too seriously.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't do anything real there, so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's a very [inaudible] place, people, you know, are coming and going.  And I really didn't raise the girls there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I really didn't.  Um --
R:  You raised them?  So, you've been in Portland, oh, quite a long time?
L:  Oh, yeah, a long time, yeah.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Grew up here.  I been here twenty years, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so [several inaudible words], but it's like, you know, I, um, I became more of a believer in some of the family value concepts because of what happened to my life, and I -- [inaudible] I think people should necessarily always stay married, but I was just [SIGH], um, taken aback at what happened to me and how little say I [several inaudible words].  Although I take some responsibility that my marriage didn't work out, I -- I [inaudible] -- I wasn't exactly given a true chance to do anything about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] he was, uh, ready to go.  He was already ready to go, and he'd already kind of arranged a life for himself, which I just think is disgusting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- frankly.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and I'll tell you, [inaudible] my other little family value thing, and it's just that I understand that it's primarily the responsibility of the [inaudible] in the relationship, but I think people who interfere in other people's marriages are very -- you know, I'm -- I'm [several inaudible words] about my ex's wife who was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- his girlfriend before we divorced, before I knew of her [SIGH], you know, than she is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, people think, "Well, it isn't her fault" [MN] you know, between you and -- and I think -- you know what?  It's disgusting to do that, and people should really be looked down upon who do that, I think.  People don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, I mean, I think my ex should be looked down on more, because he had kids and whatever, but [SIGH] you shouldn't interfere with somebody else's relationship.  You shouldn't, it's disgusting.
R:  Right.  I have a [SIGH] -- I work for a -- a pharmaceutical company, I'm a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- district sales manager. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And one of my representatives has four kids -- four pretty young --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  -- for the most part, they're young, all below ten, I believe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he got divorced about two years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause he was messing with someone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when he worked at a -- a laboratory.  And one of the technicians there [SIGH], you know, and that's -- and I agree with that, 'cause that's -- that's not right.
L:  And -- and obviously he is more responsible than the other person is.  I just -- I'm just always sort of blown away at how people could think [SIGH] -- and she certainly doesn't think she has any responsibility to me, she never apologized to me, and [SIGH] -- and I think she owes me an apology.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, [SIGH] you know, I just [inaudible] sort of minimum thing you should do to somebody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for -- for -- for ruining their life, but, you know.  I, you know -- I mean, I -- I do also understand that about how important certain things are because of things that happened to me.  I mean, I think my girls learned a lot through this, and [SIGH] -- [MN] I don't know what will happen with them getting married or not.  It'll be interesting to see --
R:  Yeah, I was gonna ask -- are they close in a relationship themselves at this point?
L:  Uh, my youngest daughter has -- has -- has a boyfriend [inaudible].  But she had a boyfriend -- it's interesting, she had a boyfriend, v- [inaudible] very nice boyfriend.  She will not let anybody -- jerk.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you act like a jerk and she's, "I'm sorry, you know, I'd rather be your friend, leave me, goodbye".  [SIGH] Uh, she's very, I don't know, she really respects herself and she -- she's very good that way.  But she has a boyfriend and they -- her, um, uh, and he's a wonderful kid, and he went to school in Missouri --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's from Texas.  And she went to school in Philadelphia from Portland, [several inaudible words] and lived in my basement [several inaudible words] but they really broke up basically because they realized they really couldn't see each other, and they couldn't develop the relationship, and there was school and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was too [SIGH] -- too hard to do [several inaudible words].
R:  Sure.  
L:  And I -- I thought that was -- that was good.  And her boyfriend's a very nice boy, and he seemed [several inaudible words] their kind of relationship they'll often call -- I have, like, calls coming at midnight on a Saturday 'cause, you know, my cell phone is cheap then and I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words].  Anyway, she would be at the library --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I'd go, "Karen, are you still dating?", "Oh, yeah".  I mean, they just, you know, they had their priorities very straight.  But in terms of long term, I don't know.  I think that it's going to be an issue for her.  She is very -- [several inaudible words] that she doesn't let anybody -- she's very strong and she doesn't let anybody [several inaudible words].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- self respect, but, I don't know [several inaudible words] 'cause [SIGH] -- [several inaudible words] good kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  And I -- and [MN] they don't want [several inaudible words] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't think that's -- again, sometimes those things happen.  In general I don't think that's the way you should plan it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I think -- I -- I also, I think it's [inaudible] deserve the best, and the best is to have family.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  So, your parents stayed married forever and all that stuff?
R:  Yeah, yeah, they've --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- been married for I don't know how long now, forty years or something like that.  And I'm an only child --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they live very close to me, only f- five miles away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, if your family's tight, then, you know, my grandmother's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- here.  She's [MN] just turned ninety two, so --
L:  Wow, you're a lucky guy.
R:  Yeah.
