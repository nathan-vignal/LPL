L:  Hi.  My name's Barb.
R:  Hi.  I'm Carolyn.  How are --
L:  Hi.  Nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
R:  Nice to meet you.  How you doing?
L:  I guess I'm okay.  Fighting a little --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- bit of a cold but otherwise all right.
R:  Oh, it's a terrible time to have a cold. [LAUGH]
L:  It is truly a terrible time, yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You should never have to come home from work and have hot soup [LAUGH] at the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- beginning of July.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] That's r- -- hot -- are you in a hot pa- -- a hot part of the country?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Pennsylvania.
R:  Pennsylvania?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ew, that's pretty nasty. [LAUGH]
L:  Where are you?
R:  Ah, i- -- near Seattle.
L:  Oh, wow, you're way the other direction.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Completely other side of the country.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, what are your ha- -- hobbies?
L:  Well, I work in the library so, obviously, I'm a huge reader.
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  And I love my computer and I'm a TV and music, type of, junkie.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh, those all keep you very, very busy.  What kinds of things do you like to read?
L:  I'm mostly a fiction person, love story, romance, true to life --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- mystery.  I'm not a non fiction reader.
R:  Those are fun.  I like the combination, like, ah, historical fiction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a great way to learn about history.
L:  That's funny -- I just had a patron ask me today how I could locate historical fiction books for her -- most of our collection isn't cross reference that way.
R:  Yeah.  That's a pity.
L:  And she said, "But I don't wanna read, you know, current day things.  I wanna read -- like you said, read and be able to learn something from it or --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- go back and reference a particular person in a historical fiction setting".  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was, sort of, at a loss as to how to help her --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because our se- -- our section isn't set up that way and I don't usually read that.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if it's something that I read and they come in and ask about it then I'm in great shape.  But if I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't read it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- then I just end up looking really stupid because I say, "Well, I'm sorry but I'll -- you know, give me a name and then I'll try to find more people like that one".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is basically --
R:  That's --
L:  -- what I start with.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, I think there are some lists around too.  'Cause I, kinda, was in the same fix -- I wasn't quite sure how to find them and, ah, went into the library and I think I did find one list at the library that I was at just then and they had, oh, half a dozen.  And then, you know, picking up a, um -- the authors, like you said, and trying to find others that [inaudible] to it is where I went from there.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, ah, it's not easy.
L:  Well, w- --
R:  But there's a lot of them out there if you just happen to know what they are. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I don't know.  This woman in particular mentioned one and said, "I've -- I've read some of her work and she writes in the style that I would like to read --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- but these books aren't those". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  I said, "Oh, okay".  Let me go back and try to figure that out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, "You w- -- you wanna read more of how she writes but you don't wanna read about these particular people that she's writing about?"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, without -- like I said, without knowing the exactly --
R:  Well, see, there -- that's where your, ah, computer, ah, skills come in.  Then you get on the internet and start doing searches based on --
L:  They do.  That's what I told her.  I said, "I'm gonna have to go to Barnes and Noble or something and just start cross referencing".
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause we have a new computer system at the library so I can do that but it's only --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for the books that we've put in since last year.
R:  Oh, pooh. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, the system before was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- still the antiquated microfilm and all that stuff and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they weren't about to s- -- put subjects with their books.  You're lucky you got an -- an -- title and an author.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's --
L:  So, we're trying to put more with it.
R:  What a frustration. [LAUGH]
L:  Defin- definitely interesting.
R:  I read a --
L:  What are your hobbies?
R:  Um, well, I'm a quilter.  That's a -- a big hobby for me.  And I love gardening, which -- when this call came in I was standing here at the sink stripping leaves off of lavender that I just picked.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, it's a very fragrant pastime at the moment. [LAUGH] And, ah, a couple of days ago I went with, ah, friends of mine to a -- a place, oh, about a hundred miles from here, where they have a lot of lavender fields and, ah, quilt shops.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, we made a day of it hitting the lavender fields and I bought a couple of lavender plants and then going to quilt stores and buying fabric.
L:  Oh, my --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- goodness.
R:  So ...  Quilting can be a very time consuming hobby.
L:  I was actually online trying to find a file for something that I did -- I work at -- I work for the library but I also work for the library board --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the Board of Directors and I had to do a project.  Tonight I'm trying to access [LAUGH] a Publisher address list that I cannot find.  So, I'm about ready to scream down the hall for my teenage son to come down and try to find it for me --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- otherwise I have to recreate it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- throughout the evening and I'm really hoping I don't have to do that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know it's in there somewhere.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just finding --
R:  You've --
L:  -- it.
R:  -- lost it on your computer, huh?
L:  And I -- I'm very good at finding it 'cause that's -- you know, I enjoy doing that and h- --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and having -- and especially having it all set up, if I -- I have it I know it's saved in there and I just can't figure out what in the world it was saved under from last November.
R:  Oh.  Have you, um, done a search that will actually go through the files and look for keywords?
L:  I tried.  I tried looking for one of the people's names 'cause I thought that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- would be a really obscure thing that you wouldn't just find this -- you know, this very odd name and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it pulled up, you know, a million different things so I have to --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- just start going back through there and if -- if I can't find it I'll just have to retype them all.  But --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I have the addresses, I just don't wanna have to go through the pr- -- the process of actually retyping them all back in there.
R:  Was it a Word document or something like that?
L:  I'm thinking -- at -- at the top it says Publisher Address List but whenever I search my Publisher files, I can't find it.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what -- what exactly happened to it.  And, like I said --
R:  M- --
L:  -- it was the beginning of last November so it's not like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was last month and, you know, right on the tip of my tongue where I had it.
R:  Right.  Oh, how frustrating.
L:  But as long as I have the whole evening and tomorrow morning to find it, I can always recreate it.  It's only about seventy or eighty names and I have the address and so it's just, basically --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- inputting all that information but I just didn't wanna do it.
R:  A- a-  that's what -- really how you --
L:  Plain and simple.
R:  -- wanna spend your evening though, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  No -- only way I wanna spend my evening, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- fighting a cold, drinking hot tea and typing out address labels.
R:  Pooh.  Pooh.
L:  Much more fun.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, hey, then -- then the music comes into play, right?  You said you were a music lover --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- right?
L:  I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm a -- sort of, a country music, easy listening, sort of, music person.
R:  Oh.
L:  What type of things do you listen to?
R:  Oh, a lot of different things really.  Um, I'm not really into rock n roll too much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Although, you know, there's exceptions to everything.
L:  Definitely.
R:  There's -- I can't really say any one particular kind because I like so many different ones.  I love, like, musical theatre --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, Broadway, kinds of, things.  Um, some of the -- the country stuff I enjoy.  I -- I like Dolly Parton -- I think she's cool.
L:  Mhm.  She is cool.
R:  Um, I like a- -- yeah.  I like singers from the forties and the fifties and things like that from my parents' era.  And, ah, rap is the one thing I really avoid. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm with you there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And thankfully --
R:  It's just --
L:  -- I don't have a child that likes it either so --
R:  I --
L:  -- I'm in good shape.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a little too intense for me.  But, other than that, ah -- in fact, we were just downloading music from the internet here a few days ago and it was funny what I was coming up with 'cause I was doing stuff from Danny K --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, ah, Jimmy Dean and Burle Ives and, ah, Abba, ah [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.  Nice --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- cross section. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's -- it's interesting that way.  You don't get too bored with any one kind.  That's what happens is I get bored if I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- listen to one kind too long.  It just gets old and irritating.
L:  We do that a lot.  We download things and my -- my husband was laughing because he listened to my sons and my son's fi- -- my oldest son's fifteen and he said, "He has the strangest taste in music".  I said, "No, he just has a really different --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- taste".  You know, because some of it's what you're hearing on the radio now that the -- the, you know, teenage kids are listening to but then the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- next song is Billy Joel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And three songs later it's James Taylor.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he said, "This is the weirdest mix".  He said, "There's Ella Fitzgerald on his MP three player".
R:  Yeah.  I have some of that too.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And -- you know, and it's just this -- you -- it's so much fun.  It's more fun to listen that way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you don't get locked into -- you know, he doesn't mind some of my country but he would never just sit and choose to listen to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if he can select, you know, five songs and mix them in with five songs from The Eagles or he hears -- you know, he loves American Pie by Don McLean --
R:  Oh, I hate that song.
L:  -- even though for years --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he -- for years he thought Billy Joel sang it.  I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- said, "N- no".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he didn't realize.  He had downloaded it and whoever put it on the site listed it as a Billy Joel song.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] that's funny.
L:  So, that's what he saw and that's what he has instant- -- I said, "That is not Billy Joel.  How could you --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- listen to Billy Joel and think that Don McLean is Billy Joel?"
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know --
L:  You know?  And --
R:  -- if you don't know the artist, you know, you can accept most anything.
L:  No, he -- you know, he really -- to him, it didn't make any difference until --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- he heard more Billy Joel then he realized that he was wrong.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, but this is so much -- it's such an interesting way to -- to do that.  We download things and I'll make CDs.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And a- another hobby I have, I like to walk.  So, I'll put my CD player on and I'll make a jazzy CD, you know, that I can walk to that has a lot of upbeat songs to it --
R:  Oh, that's a good idea.
L:  -- to keep me going and -- and he laughs at me now 'cause he said one of -- the easiest way to irritate me is to put my CD that I listen to in my car and put it on random order.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because I know -- you know, even though I've --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- made it and it's all different music --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as one song ends I know what the next one's gonna be because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I listen to it over and over again.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And he said, "Oh, I can really play with you.  If I put it in the car and put it on random order --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- you start to sing the next song and it's not there".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They've now learned that that's a little way to irk me is to throw my CDs in a -- you know, in a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- strange pattern that the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- songs aren't where they're supposed to be.
R:  I actually like them in random order.  I h- -- I don't like the predictability.  Even if I have a compilation of a -- a bunch of different ones, I'd rather even mix those, like, on the random order.  So, he wouldn't have any fun playing tricks on me.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My -- my husband and my kids love the random order thing and I'm -- I need the predictability.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I need to know exactly what's coming up next.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, to each his own, you know?  Whatever --
L:  Definitely.
R:  Whatever works.
L:  And I do a l- -- I do a little bit of gardening.  In fact, I have some plants outside I told a co worker today, I said, "I have to plant some Hosta plants" and she said --
