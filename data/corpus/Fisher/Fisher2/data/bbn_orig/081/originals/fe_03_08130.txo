L:  Hi, my name's Jennifer.
R:  Hi, my name's Tristen and I'm north east Pennsylvania.  How are you doing?
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I'm in north east Ohio, so --
R:  Oh, isn't that so funny?  Ha.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] what an appropriate topic for Independence Day, huh?
L:  Right.  I was going to say, happy fourth of July.
R:  Oh sure.  Um, you know, I missed the first part of that question, though, what did it say?  "How would you react during a terrorist attack?"
L:  Yes.  It says, "How would you react during a terrorist attack?  And how um would you handle it I think exactly?" is what it said.
R:  Oh my gosh.  Oh, I don't know what I -- I -- [inaudible] and I ah we go over that scenario and we talk about [inaudible] [LAUGH] like if it ever hit home, but I think it's really unlikely because we live in a very rural area, so [LIPSMACK] I um -- I don't know.
L:  Well, w- I live in a suburb of Akron, I don't really think that there's, you know, anything here that they would really be interested in --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- but that's something that you never know and -- and --
R:  Well, how far's Gary Nuclear Power Plant from you?
L:  Oh, it's um -- it's a ways.  It's -- I think it's down --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- by Columbus.
R:  Are you downwind from it too?
L:  So, it's a couple of hours away.
R:  Guess so, huh?  Yes.
L:  Mm, yeah, I guess.
R:  Because I say that ah -- that wasn't --
L:  Yeah, I wasn't even thinking about that.
R:  -- in the newspaper anyway, in Erie[?] newspaper, Erie's not too far from Akron.  Mm. They were talking about that in the unlikely but possible event of an -- of an attack on the nuclear power plant in the country.  We're downwind from the nuclear power plant -- [inaudible] nuclear plant as well, so I don't know.  Hopefully, that would never --
L:  Oh.  I guess that would be a very big concern.  And I wasn't even, you know, really concentrating on that.  I was thinking of, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- what was in the -- our immediate area here that they would um be interested in.  But you never know.  I mean, those kind of people, they -- you don't know what they might just go after, every federal building in every city, or they could, you know, decide to do anything, I mean it's -- it's scary, but I don't think --
R:  Sure.  In fact, I was kind of anticipating --
L:  -- you can um, you know, just put your life --
R:  -- that, especially after the --
L:  -- on hold because of it.
R:  -- September eleventh attacks, there would be, you know, small cells coming out of the woodwork and attacking places like that.  I mean I -- I think ah everybody was expecting the unexpectable and that -- that was definitely a possibility.  [COUGH]
L:  Well, it was really hor- yeah, and it was so horrible and I'm -- I mean I know that something has to be done but I'm one of those that I think, "What do we accomplish by killing people for killing people?" I mean, they need to be punished and it seems like that's the only thing that can be done, so you know, and then in -- in the paper today, what, they've got a twenty five million dollar um [LIPSMACK] reward for Saddam Hussein and um so much for his brothers and I think, "Oh, this is just unreal" you know, they've --
R:  I don't think they ever will --
L:  -- sent our soldiers over there all that time --
R:  -- it's like somebody trying to get to the president, I think --
L:  -- and I really felt they would never find him, so --
R:  -- you know, I mean I think they have to -- they -- you know, maybe they don't have ah, you know, d- developed country that we have, but as far as technology --
L:  Oh, yes.  Yeah I --
R:  -- and protecting their president, I think that they have just as much as we do.  And if, you know, they are -- you -- you know, you have to go by what you see on the news and you just imagine like I -- I don't really know a really tight network of tunnels --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and buildings and places that he could rush to, just like our president can be.  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  See, when um --
L:  So --
R:  -- and when those September eleventh attacks happened --
L:  -- I don't know.  All you can do is --
R:  -- they -- there was an article in the paper --
L:  -- just everyday pray that ah --
R:  -- about the potential of a [inaudible] --
L:  -- that it won't happen again --
R:  -- [inaudible] nuclear plant disaster --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- and people around here started to buy the -- what do you call that, activated iodine?  So in the event of nuclear fallout you can take iodine so it doesn't get absorbed into your thyroid, so you won't get thyroid cancer.  So, people did buy that up and my father was one of 'em, you know, my father's from that generation that, you know, they did practise --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in the fallout shelter, they had masks, they got under their desks and ah I don't know, I think it was more real for him because of the -- the cold war and the iron curtain.  He -- he remembers more of that than I do -- and I'm thirty, so it was just falling apart as I became an adult, you know.  [PAUSE]  Mhm.  Oh no.
L:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE] Well, I'm fifty three, and I hate to have to say it, but anyway, no but I remember in grade school how we used to have every week we had um you know drills and ah we would have to go in the hallway and, you know, put our heads down and put our arms over our heads and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I always thought, "Boy, this is so stupid" you know and then, you know, after that happened, I thought, "Well, it wasn't so stupid after all" --
R:  I almost think though some of those drills they got as a comfort device --
L:  -- but, you know, you worry about your --
R:  -- as what good is --
L:  -- your kids --
R:  -- shuffling into a hallway and getting under a desk going to do --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- in the actual event of a terrorist attack?
L:  Well, you worry about all your family.
R:  Nuclear, biological or chemical.
L:  That's the truth.
R:  On, you know, [LIPSMACK] and even the day of the September eleventh attacks my kids were in school and ah you know I'm almost embarrassed to admit it, but I picked them up from school, I didn't know what would happen, if there was a wave of panic --
L:  True.
R:  -- and I guess that's how it starts --
L:  That is.
R:  -- you know, people rushing to get their children.  But I guess in Pennsylvania they enacted a ah there's -- oh, what is it called?  It's part of the homeland security and part of the FIMA[?] what they do --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- like ah they have actual guidelines in the event of a terrorist attack.  Anybody [inaudible] and it's in a code of laws that was just recently passed, anybody trying to remove their children from a playground in the event of a terrorist attack will be shot.  Parents or other.  You know, so they just um -- there -- there's an entire code and guidelines in the event of a terrorist attack in your area that you must follow because then FIMA takes over, so hm.  [PAUSE] 
L:  I -- I don't get the paper everyday and I mean there could possibly be something here that, you know, I'm not aware of --
R:  Yeah, Gulf War, Desert Storm.
L:  -- but um -- I know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a few years back when ah the Gulf War, what was it called then, I can't even r- -- yeah, Desert Storm, well I worked for a doctor that was from Syria and um, you know, they had even said to us that we should be careful of anybody that came around, you know, and it was like, "This is ridiculous", you know, because his -- all his friends, you know, he had doctors that were friends from Pakistan and [LIPSMACK] um Iran and everything, so it was like, "Okay, who are you going to know that walks in is, ah, whether they're friend or foe?" you know, what -- what will -- would you do?  So, you know, we just went on as -- as usual and we had a security system where, you know, we could -- there was a button that we could push, you know, which would -- that was just part of our regular security system, but they had said they thought that ah individuals from countries over there --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- would be more likely to um be harmed, you know, and he -- he's -- he's been in the United States for years and married here in the States and has five children and ah so, you know, that was -- at first that was a little, you know, scary for us then and I thought, "Well, what are we going to do about it?  There's nothing you really can do, you just, you have to go on" and ah I mean my heart goes out, I can't even imagine the -- the sadness that these families have gone through from September eleventh and especially the news media, how, you know, they've got to talk about body parts and this and that and unfortunately, you know, they ah -- they l- that's what they ah [LIPSMACK] you know, dwell on is all these things.  They want to ah
