L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Tori.
L:  I'm Michelle.
R:  Hi, Michelle.
L:  Ah, well, ah I personally have no issue with companies doing spot checks.  I think that it would be a good thing, actually.
R:  Yeah?  Um, well, I'm in Canada --
L:  Oh.
R:  And ah we're just sort of I think in the process of trying to decriminalize um marijuana anyway.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so, if we decriminalize then I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, it would still make it illegal, but it would just make it a lesser charge, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] -- ah --
L:  Are you referring to medicinal purposes, or just for socialization?
R:  Socialization.  Just decriminalize it.
L:  Right.
R:  Doesn't make it legal, it just it -- it would be a fine as opposed to a prison term equal to somebody who's dealing coke or something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah like -- 'cause right now, people that are get -- that get caught with marijuana ah go to jail as l- longer than somebody who rapes, which doesn't make any sense to me, but I suppose we're supposed to be talking about drug testing [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, drug testing.  Actually, I don't agree --
L:  You don't agree?
R:  -- with drug testing.  No, I don't.
L:  And --
R:  I think it's an inbr- invasion of privacy because I -- I don't think it should be as illegal as it is, um, maybe -- maybe alcohol should be illegal and if alcohol were illegal, then I'd probably have no problem with marijuana being illegal --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Whoa, they picked a subject that was really close your heart [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well -- well, I can honestly say I've never ah attempted any type of a drug, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah it -- I guess from my standpoint it could all -- I -- they could check me any day of the week, so it really would not affect me, or I would consider it to be an invasion of ah of my privacy.  And I guess it also depends upon if you know this going in, whatever position, I mean, you know, it's choices that we make in life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, if we -- if we take on certain positions where this is something that is going to happen, then I feel that we have no other alternative but to accept it --
R:  Mhm.  I agree.  I agree.  If you take on a job that -- that tells you that they will be doing random drug testing, then you have made the choice --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to -- to have -- to, you know, have that happen to you.  But I think what people do on their own time is also um nobody else's business and if some r- somebody were to, you know, engage in illegal drugs, even though it's illegal, um, you know, so is speeding, but ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if somebody were to engage in -- in ah, you know, drugs on the weekend, how is that going to affect their job on a Monday to Friday basis?
L:  Well, you know, everything is relative.  I -- I -- I assume that depends on ah the person and the amount that they indulge in, just as you mention with alcoholism.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Some people can drink on the weekends and not have ah necessarily an addiction during the week whereas we know that you know a- all of these car crashes are caused by, you know, these people driving while intoxicated.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you know, I -- I guess it's -- it's a matter of, you know, some people, their tolerance level is higher than others, so it's really relative, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whereas you may be able to be fine or someone that you know may be fine with the um [LIPSMACK] you know, certain um drugs for ah pleasure, or whatever, where others just could not simply handle it.
R:  Mhm.  E- and I suppose it's hard too because I -- I do believe there's ah a big difference between I don't know even -- I don't even know what the drugs are they do these days, like E or -- or whatever they do at the raves and --
L:  Oh, Lord.
R:  -- um -- and I don't know, coke, I think there's a huge difference between those very hard drugs and something soft or like marijuana.  So, if you're --
L:  Well --
R:  -- drug testing for -- for opiates or -- or cocaine, that is different to me than t-
L:  Well, unfortunately, unless you're a purist and you're -- you're doing it yourself, ah, from what I understand, they are mixed --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- with other additives.  So, you really don't know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- fully what it is that you're, you know, that you would be taking in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're taking a risk.
R:  I suppose, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] You know, anyway, because it could be laced.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that -- that's also one of the -- the big things out there, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] but you know, again I guess I see it from my standpoint, um, unfortunately ah I embrace that because whereas again you're saying casually weekend, u- u- you know, while you're not working or whatever, however would you want a pilot under the influence?
R:  Absolutely not [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  And I understand maybe that there are jobs where it maybe is essential --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but at the -- at the same time let -- like, um, I don't know exactly how long things stay in your blood, but I believe that say something as soft marijuana will stay in your bloodstream for up to thirty days, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even if -- I think they b- ah -- the last Olympics, they got ah -- they got one of our um our skiers or -- or one of those guys in the Olympics and he lost his medal because they found THC in his blood.  Well -- and he said that he was at a party --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well, I mean, who knows what kind of truth there is to that, right?  But he said he was at a party where everybody else was smoking it and it would have just gotten into him that way.  So, who knows the effect like if it's really a true test.
L:  Right.  Well, we -- we also know that nothing is a hundred percent and, you know, they can do toxicology things and it picks up something else, you perhaps could be on a medication that would also give you, um, you know, an indication of --
R:  A false positive.
L:  Right.  Of there being something there.  So, I guess though the things that would have to be considered and again if you have proof of that, then that should not really be held against you, but I guess the whole thing is that you have to weigh, you know, you're thinking of yourself and perhaps those around you that are able and capable of handling it, but think of those that are not and, as I said, there have been incidences of late with pilots that have been very high and --
R:  Mm.  What are they testing for, though?  Like, when these pilots -- what drugs are they getting positives from?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, even the alcoholism, there was a big thing about them being even intoxicated --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's a drug to me as well.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  Um, even being, you know, drunk in the cockpit is not cool.
R:  Well, being drunk, stoned, high anything in the cockpit isn't cool.
L:  That's correct.
R:  And -- and I don't believe it's cool to be any of those things while you're at work.
L:  Well, but see then you -- you -- you when -- you know, you leave the door open for them to state that, "Well, it was five hours ago, so I figured it would be okay by now" and different things like that because again whenever you take -- you can take all of us and give everyone a tylenol or an aspirin and it's not going to work a -- work on us in the same manner --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at the same pace.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  So, again, it goes back to whether or not you're capable of handling and others, you know, that -- that's a big can or worms to open up [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  I guess it -- it does become a fine line and it is difficult to say.  I -- I think there are a some jobs where it is necessary.  I think most jobs it's unnecessary.
L:  Because I also agree with you on the alcoholism in terms of um, you know, I think that there should be -- I personally think that there should be stricter guidelines behind that because I feel that when a person goes down and bends their elbows, to me I equate that with putting a bullet in a gun.
R:  Mm.
L:  And you go out and you, you know, you get behind that wheel.  When you're turning that -- that key in there, you know, it's like you're playing Russian Roulette --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, absolutely.  I agree.  Yeah, it's a -- it's a tough call I think.  Ah I think it's illegal in um -- well, I'm not sure if it's illegal, but I know somebody who works for the Federal Government and they have said that the Federal Government cannot -- cannot legally test their Federal employees --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and so -- and I -- I also know my husband's worked for a um construction company where he was subjected to random testing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.  Like I -- I think it's almost against the law, but everybody just does it.  It's again- I say, I do believe in this country it's against our rights just because I -- I know somebody who works for the Federal Government and that's what he told me --
L:  [NOISE] Well, again, you know, things are changing.  Before you're hired you might have to sign a disclaimer or something saying that it's --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- okay, you know, because so many things are changing now and they really have to keep up because there's so much loss, you know, happening with, you know, people that are just not doing -- not performing appropriately for multiple reasons.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know, but [NOISE] it would not hurt me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It would not harm me.  But I hear ya.  So, what part of Canada?
R:  I'm from Alberta.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I know actually this is gonna -- this is a problem right now between the States and Canada because Canada wants to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- make this decriminalized and the Americans are very um --
L:  [LAUGH] Against it?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm from Maryland.  So, I see the effects of the, yeah, the marijuana usage and, you know, if -- if you go into the district and, you know, you can see the people hanging out.
