R:  Hello?
L:  Hello there.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  [COUGH]  Excuse me.  Pretty good.  My name's Bridgette.
R:  Bridgette?
L:  Yes.  
R:  My name is Kendra.
L:  Hi Kendra.
R:  How are you?
L:  I love that name. [LAUGH] Pretty good.
R:  Oh, thank you.
L:  You're welcome.
R:  Now, what State are you in?
L:  I'm in Michigan.
R:  Michigan.  I'm in Ohio.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, we're not too far [LAUGH].
L:  No, we're almost neighbors [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  So [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH] --
L:  S- --
R:  Okay. I missed what her first question was.  I didn't -- something about divorce.  But I -- I didn't quite catch -- I was having a hard time understanding her.
L:  I -- well, it was sort of an odd question, if I heard correctly.  It was, "How has divorced changed -- h- has it changed how you behave or act?" or the divorce rate, I guess, which I thought --
R:  Hm.  That is kind of a strange question.
L:  Mhm.  Because it's like, well, um, okay, it would affect me if I were divorced --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  -- but I don't know that I e- e- --
R:  I'm not divorced.  I -- I --
L:  No.
R:  -- obviously you aren't either, from your response there, so -- and my parents are not divorced --
L:  Oh, same here actually.
R:  -- ah, so I guess it really hasn't really affected me personally --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Um --
L:  I mean, I know of some peo- --
R:  And I can -- and none of my friends I mean, amazingly, none of my friends even have parents that are divorced.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, that's -- I know that's probably unusual --
L:  I think it is.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in today's age it would be.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And my husband's parents are, you know, they just celebrated their thirty ninth wedding anniversary --
L:  Th- 
R:  -- so --
L:  [MN] My husband's parents just celebrated their fiftieth.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's awesome.  That's so awesome.
L:  So it -- you know -- yes, isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, and then the second one was something about um [LIPSMACK] oh, silly, now I just lost it.  I should have written this down as she was saying it --
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- does it change your feelings on the institution of marriage?
R:  That's right.  Um, no.  I still feel that the marr- marriage is ah between a man and a woman and that's the way it has been and I think that that's the way that I will feel that it will always be.
L:  Mhm.  And e- the fact that there are a certain number of people getting divorced really doesn't -- to me at least doesn't change that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's unfortunate and I have -- I have sympathy for those who are going through it --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- um --
R:  I take that back.  My -- I guess my brother in law's ah the man my sister married, his mom and dad divorced when he was just a young kid --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- obviously I didn't know him at that point, but um, but you know, they even -- I have to admire them because they really um [LIPSMACK] had made an effort and he remarried, she never did, and um they're -- they're still friends --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and they've made that effort to be friends for their son --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and so they can be in the house, I mean we were just at their son's um [LIPSMACK] their grandson's um fifth birthday party and they've made that effort to all be there and not, you know, fight.  They get along and they get along well.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, you know, I -- and I hand that to them, for that.
L:  Yeah.  And it's tough to do because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I've several friends who have divorced ah my -- my -- like my husband's family, he's the youngest of five --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and even though his parents are not divorced, his brothers have, well, let's see.  There, see, there are five of them and there have been one, two, three, four, divorces.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I mean, recently there's been [SIGH] they haven't been untouched by it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you know e- [SIGH] even they, I think, would say [SIGH] it's not that that was a good thing or something that they would have chosen or wanted --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and I don't -- I don't know that people -- I don't think people are taking marriage any less seriously, um [MN] --
R:  No, I think they honestly feel they're in love and they're going into it for the right reasons --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, for whatever reason it hasn't worked.  Now, how many years have you been married?
L:  Ten.
R:  Ten.  We've been married thirteen --
L:  Well --
R:  -- we just had our thirteenth --
L:  Congratulations [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, thank you [LAUGH] thank you.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, but you know, even through some of the tough times ah I've -- divorce wasn't even a word in our vocabulary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it was just, you know, we'll get through it, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Just --
R:  -- we'll do what we have to do to -- to work around it and ah -- and it wasn't even a e- a thought in our -- either of our minds.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... I guess I've been very blessed.
L:  It [SIGH] and, you know, it [SIGH] I -- I was talking to a friend of mine who did, well just sort of walk away from her marriage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it wasn't [SIGH] e- [SIGH] how do I put, it was one of those things of, "Well, there's too many sacrifices and you shouldn't have to sacrifice" --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and all I could think of is, "But sacrifice isn't a bad thing" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it's [SIGH] --
R:  I agree.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- marriage is something that has value and so you pay a price for it.  It's -- it's [SIGH], you know, would we value it as much if there weren't struggles.
R:  Right.  Absolutely.
L:  You know, and --
R:  I think you do have to have struggles.  I think every marriage has struggles.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah --
L:  Other- yeah.
R:  Makes it stronger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In the end, so --
L:  And -- and more interesting I think [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, absolutely [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You can at least ah hopefully go back and ah and reminisce --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- on the -- on the bad times and ah realize that you've grown and you've learnt from your mistakes or learned from the hard times and ah you've made your marriage stronger from that.
L:  Hm.
R:  And unfortunately I think sometimes people do just tend to hit a hard spot and then don't work that -- work through it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or aren't willing to.
L:  Or decide, "Well, we're incompatible".
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Um --
R:  And ah thankfully ah you know, and neither of our parents were divorced and I guess they just raised us to -- that marriages are forever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah --
L:  And [MN] and you know, given what I've heard from people and what they suffer when they go through a divorce, thou- that pain seems so much greater than any of the difficulties that happen in marriage.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially for the kids, too, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel so bad for those that are divorced that have kids, they're the ones that um, you know, they don't understand and they're innocent bystanders in the whole thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, my prayer is that they -- the parents just, you know, do what it takes to make it work for them and realize that they're not the cause of this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I taught -- I used to teach school and I had a lot of kids --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- you know, with divorced parents, but um even that wasn't [SIGH] it wasn't a high number when I taught.  I -- I haven't -- well, I guess I haven't taught in about maybe nine years, ten years now, so I guess that was a while ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm getting older, I guess.
L:  Well, you know, it's funny how that sneaks up on you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Isn't it? [LAUGH]
R:  Everybody else is getting older, but I'm not [LAUGH].
L:  That's right [LAUGH].
R:  What are you talking about? [LAUGH]
L:  So old?  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How old are -- do you have kids?
R:  I do.  We have two, one is three and one is ah fourteen months.
L:  Wow, very --
R:  The -- and we were married for nine and a half years before um our kids came to us through adoption, so --
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  -- one of those struggles that we went through [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  And -- and you know what, those aren't easy ones.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's um [SIGH]
R:  But, you know what, I wouldn't trade those kids for anything.  I -- I -- we couldn't love 'em anymore, you know, they're the best --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thing that has ever come out of our marriage, you know, and --
L:  Wonderful.
R:  -- there's those -- that was a hard thing to go through but I -- in the end we ended up with such a [LAUGH] a blessing and -- and two --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- wonderful kids.  
L:  Good.
R:  How about you?
L:  We have one.
R:  One?
L:  He's five [LAUGH].
R:  Five [LAUGH].
L:  So --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it -- like my husband's a stay at home dad.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  So it -- yeah.
R:  That's neat.
L:  And he -- he always wanted a big family, so --
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  And we thought, well, we'll work on that [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] if you're -- you know, if you're willing to stay at home with them, [LIPSMACK] okay [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, that's neat. That's great.
L:  So --
R:  My -- I'm a stay at home mom, so um --
L:  It's such a -- I don't know how you all do it --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- um [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There are days --
L:  You know, you, my husband --
R:  -- that I wonder too [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My husband gets home and I'm going, "I need a break" [LAUGH].
L:  [several inaudible words] Adult conversation, can we?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, exactly.  I call my friend who has three and I'm like, "Please, I need an adult to talk to" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm about sick of singing the Barney song. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] He's a --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- a little boy or little girl that you have?
L:  A little boy.
R:  A little boy.
L:  Mhm.  Well, five year old.
R:  Right.
L:  He wouldn't call himself little. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's probably true, yeah.  My daughter thinks she's -- she's getting bit too, and she is.
L:  At three?
R:  But --
L:  Yes, three is very big. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's right [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But you know, it -- they're just such a blessing and, you know, that was a really hard thing for us to go through --
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- but we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, actually we do have -- know somebody who they were not -- unable to have a biological child and they divorced over it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And um, you know, that wasn't even a thought in our minds --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was just, "Okay.  What's the next step?"  I guess, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- great, we get to adopt.  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It wasn't, "We have to adopt", it was "We get to adopt".
L:  Get.  Yeah.
R:  And um it -- you know, like I wouldn't trade it for the world, so ...
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- they're -- certain- certainly blessings in our lives and um, you know, that -- that was a wonderful thing that came out of a struggle in our marriage, but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, it's just so sad to see when people just give up --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Especially because I do, well and you do
