R:  Hi, my name is Marion.
L:  My name is Lisa.
R:  Hi, Lisa.
L:  Hi.
R:  [MN] I guess we're going to talk about values.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  This is my first time.  So ...
L:  Yeah, this is my first time, too.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I guess they're talking about divorce more or less, how it affects the family values and um I don't know, I feel very strongly that it does affect the family values and the family.  How do you feel about that?
L:  Yeah, that's -- I think so too.  It affects the children.
R:  Of course it does.  Um, of course I'm older, I'm in my seventies, so um we've had a very stable marriage.  Of course, not that my kids didn't ever have problems, they did, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but I think I see it moreso in my grandchildren because I have three divorced children with children and right now I have a [MN] grandson going through a really, really bad time.  Just so full of hatred and I really think it's because of what happened with his family.
L:  Yeah, my husband, he was married before he got with me and he's got two daughters and so we know first hand what it does to the children because we don't hardly have a relationship with them.  They live over two hundred miles away with their mother and --
R:  Well, that's even harder, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And ah, I don't, now I look around and I see the girl across the street's divorced and she's got a girl, a little girl and, you know, she seems, because she's only going into high school this year, trouble may be ahead, but she seems to be very well adjusted, I think because she has a good relationship with her father.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which I think is unusual.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because he lives here -- around here.  So, she can go there ah during the week and she can go on weekends and, you know, that's a lot easier --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  It's just hardest on the kids is --
R:  It's tough today on kids, you know.
L:  Mhm.  [SIGH]
R:  And your husband um doesn't see the children that much?
L:  No.  He used to in the beginning, but [SIGH] it just turned into all they do is fight, him and his ex wife fight all the time and it's just [SIGH] where I'm in the middle, I, you know, I pretty much I try to be the one to get him to get along for the kids' sake and this, that and whatever.  But --
R:  It's just not the same when they don't live with their parents, right?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  And it's just the issue of child support also, that, with divorce, that factors in and it's just --
R:  Yeah.  Everything factors in.
L:  And it just makes --
R:  Well, we have lots of divorce in our family, so I see yeah, yeah, my husband and I have been married fifty years next year and -- but you don't see that today, so we're probably going to be ah an item because, you know, there's not --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- everybody's divorced or they don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know what's wrong with this world.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.  And his parents were divorced, so --
R:  Were they?
L:  Yeah, so he -- I don't know, they -- they say that that matters, like if the -- if you come from a divorced family then it -- then you'll --
R:  Then, how was your husband through that divorced family?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  How was your husband?  How did he survive the divorced --
L:  Ah, he doesn't have anything to do with his mother today.  She left ah the family when he was eight years old and so he --
R:  Oh, that's very difficult.
L:  -- so, I mean, that could be the reason, you know, possibly why he ended up getting a divorce and now me and him are together and [LAUGH] I don't believe in it, though, I don't believe in divorce at all because my parents stayed together and --
R:  Did they?
L:  -- still are together and --
R:  Yeah.  Well, there's still -- but I guess demands are so hard today, like lifestyle's so different, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and of course I never worked till my youngest child was like twelve and today everybody's working and I think the family, the values go and nobody's home.  You know, the kids are coming home alone and then they get --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in trouble, they're on the computer and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a different lifestyle.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  And you can't help that, people have to survive.
L:  Yeah, and nobody sits down for dinner anymore either together, that in the day it's just easier --
R:  No.
L:  -- just to go get fast food and head out the door and --
R:  Yeah, the kids are here and they're there and they're all around and it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, it's true, there's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not the same, but hey, nothing stays the same, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I look around, I do see some people, really have a good family life even though they're divorced.  I don't know, maybe it's just the kids and some other, you know, make up.  Some kids are more, you know, I don't know, more steady and have --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- more commonsense and others don't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But whatever, but, ah as I say, I see a big difference in it.
L:  Mm.
R:  But it's not going to change, right?  It can only get worse.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Now, where are you from?
L:  Kentucky.
R:  Kentucky.  Wow.  I'm from New Jersey.
L:  Oh.
R:  And um, you know, it's a lot of -- ah but I have a -- there's a lot of money up here and I see the people that ha- you know, even with the families that are not divorced, I see kids in trouble because they have so much today --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kids don't have to work, the mother and father hand them money for cigarettes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and --
L:  Give them everything, yes.
R:  -- they  have everything and -- and they're no better off than the, you know -- so there's problems in ever family life, it's not even just divorce --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think it's more so in --
L:  It just makes it hard on -- well, I guess it makes it hard on the parents also, but just --
R:  It's very hard and my son having to follow his -- his son --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and he's really, really bad and he hates his father, but you know, it's a terrible family, he has no life --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and he worries about him, "Where is he tonight?  Where was he yesterday?" you know and, "I think he's doing drugs" and it's hard on everybody.  Nobody wins, everybody loses.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's tough.  How old are your children?
L:  Ah, four, two and four months.
R:  Oh, you got a long way to go.  This is the best time to enjoy them.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because this is the time they don't give you any problems.
L:  Oh they do though [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well, not that kind.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You think you got problems now, wait till they're fifteen and sixteen --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that was the best time of my life, when my kids were little.  I could tell them what to do, what to eat, how to dress --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as soon as they got out on their own, forget it, everything was lost.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And ah I guess I was probably very strict where the parents are not that strict today.  But, you know, kids need discipline --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ah you've got a -- a good life right now.
L:  [MN]
R:  I hope so, anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's good.  How long do we have to talk on this?  I think it's ni- eight minutes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Am I doing all the talking, or what?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How's the weather down there?  Hot?
L:  Yeah.  It's hot.
R:  Yeah.  It's very hot up here too.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So ... just reading a good book and ah kinda keep cool.  Thank God for air conditioning.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  And ah the school's are out down there, right?  So the kids are all out now?
L:  Yeah, they've been out four --
R:  Mhm.  And that's another thing. The kids don't work up here.  I don't know what it is.  The kids next door, there's two teenagers, they don't work, the kid across the street doesn't work, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I was their age I was cleaning houses.
L:  Or they don't even -- they don't get out of the house anymore, they just stay in the house in the room, play on the computer and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and their Nintendos and they don't get out and --
R:  Exercise.
L:  Yeah, that's [LAUGH] --
R:  I mean, I thought you'd have swimming.
L:  I used to get out and ride a bike all the time and that was my favorite thing to do and now it's --
R:  Now they have nothing to do but sit at that computer.  That's not a good thing, too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if it's not monitored, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I worry about that because I have a granddaughter also that does that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and somebody said she was talking to some strangers and I said, "Oh, my God, that's the worst thing in the world" but, you know, who's home to supervise?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  That's the whole thing, you know, it's -- it's just -- I guess the family values are not good today.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I think we were better off twenty years ago.  I think my kids saw the best of it.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  And um [LIPSMACK] anyway, when you get to be seventy four you look back and you see a lot of changes, you are probably young --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so you haven't seen those changes like I have and --
L:  I'm twenty seven.
R:  Yeah, you're -- oh, you're only a kid.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd kill to be twenty seven.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But you don't see those changes.  You know, we had a wonderful childhood and I think my kids had the best of it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because I was home and it -- all their friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- parents' were home, but now it's a whole different ballgame.
L:  Yeah, that makes a big difference too if the -- well, I stay at home with my kids, though, so it helps this --
R:  Well, that's a wonderful --
L:  -- mothers have to work -- 
R:  -- thing.
L:  -- if both parents have to work, then that makes stress too in the house and --
R:  You're -- it's a wonderful thing that you could be home with your children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But probably a time will come when you won't be able to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As they get older and they want this, they want that and you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and of course, you know, everybody has to work today --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's very hard to, you know, keep the kids in check, make a living --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- keep everybody happy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's it.  So, this is my first time on this, so this is how it works.  You always talk to another person.
L:  Yeah, I guess, this my first time --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- too.
R:  Oh, my daughter did this and she [inaudible] gave [several inaudible words] expect to get a phone call today.
L:  Mm.
R:  But that's a good subject because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're my age, you see a lot going back and back.  Anyway, and what do they do, cut this off at ten minutes, is that what it is?
L:  I'm not even sure.  I'm just [LAUGH] --
R:  Are we going to talk forever?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm trying to talk, but [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.  I know it does work because my daughter got a check, I -- she got a check, so I guess it must be a legit --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, that makes you feel better, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you are working, right?
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm working hard.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, your husband doesn't see these children at all that he has with the first wife?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  [MN]
R:  Does that affect the children?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Do they want to see him?
L:  Well, not anymore, no.  They --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- well, the youngest one does, but the oldest one, she refuses to, so that [SIGH] she pretty much makes the rules [SIGH] the oldest one does and --
R:  Well, you know what?  That's going to eat her alive as she gets older.  Because I have a lot of [inaudible] divorced kids, I have a girl that's eighteen and, you know, her father doesn't talk to her and it eats her alive because she really wants to have a relationship with him, but, you know, he's got the second wife and she's kind of bitchy.
L:  I mean, we have tried.  I have tried more than any of them.
R:  Have you?
L:  I -- I have tried so many times to, you know, just to talk some sense into him and tell him, you know, that this isn't right, you don't need to do that and --
R:  Who's fault is it?  His or hers?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Has he made the effort?
L:  It -- I think it's both.
R:  Yeah?
L:  He's made the effort and he's tried, but she makes it pretty much near impossible and then on top of that just -- there's always just the battle with child support and --
R:  And they get stubborn after a while, you know, they get ornery.
L:  Yeah.  It --
R:  Both sides, not just --
L:  Yeah.  Both.  Both. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but you know why it eats the kids alive, because that one daughter just so upset because her father won't talk to her.
