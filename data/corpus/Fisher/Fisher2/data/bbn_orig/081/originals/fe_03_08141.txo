L:  Hi there, I'm Pamela.
R:  Hi, I'm Barbara.
L:  Hi, Barbara.  How are you today?
R:  I'm good.  How about yourself?
L:  Very well, thank you.
R:  Good.
L:  Have you ever watched any high profile criminal trials on TV?
R:  Well, I guess the highest profile I can think of is the OJ Simpson trial.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Definitely watched some of that.
L:  I did too.  I watched a bunch of it.
R:  An- --
L:  How many years ago was that, anyway?
R:  Um, it had to be at least seven years ago, I think it was seven or eight because it was right when I got married, so --
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  And I remember --
L:  So, do you --
R:  Oh, go ahead.  
L:  No, go ahead.
R:  Um.
L:  You -- you remember what?
R:  Oh that -- that when they were doing the verdict I was at work and I worked at a call center and at that moment when they were issuing the verdict, no calls came in at all [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and usually it was pretty busy, so, everybody was watching [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  So, what is your general feeling about it?  Do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing?
R:  Well, I mean I guess I don't know enough about the law, but I don't think it's a bad thing.  I think that a lot of people are interested in that 'cause we tend to be in like a voyeuristic society a- especially w- when you see all the reality shows that are on TV now um --
L:  Yeah, I love the reality shows [LAUGH].  I kind of think --
R:  Oh, me too --
L:  -- it's a good idea too because it gives um it does give people the, you know, the ordinary citizen an opportunity to learn more about how the courtroom operates.
R:  Exactly.
L:  As long as the um -- one of the negative things, I guess, is the -- is the fact that these people are going to get all this publicity --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- you know and -- and some people may -- may do bad things, you know how it is, sometimes people do bad things just because they need the attention.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  But um I don't know if I've watched other high tr- you know, high -- I can't remember what the -- high profile, sorry, um, trials, but I know my husband and I like to watch um the Law and Order on Sundays in the summertime, they always have a real case and like you said, it really is neat to watch like because that's a real case that's really how it works in there, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, to see like ah lawyers giving the depositions and such, whatever they're called [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I remember um [LIPSMACK] that little young woman who was the au pair from Europe, from England I think, or Sco- England or Ireland or Scotland, wherever she was from, that was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah on trial, I remember a lot of that.  And I do like to watch, I watch -- I get myself on while I'm surfing sometimes I end up on the Court TV channel --
R:  Right.
L:  -- watching some of those ah I -- and I think it's interesting um from the psychological point, I guess, I find that -- and also the same reason why I watch the reality shows, too.  I love studying the psychology of how people behave under these circumstances.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um and I thought that that young woman, um, handled herself very well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't -- I don't know.  I believed her, you know, I believed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I guess it -- I guess it would also tend to sway people's opinions one way or the other about the -- the guilt or innocence of people just because of their demeanor --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on television.
R:  I agree.
L:  I don't know how that would hurt anything, other than to, you know, 'cause they're not going to be on -- in the court -- they're not going to be on the jury, anyway, so --
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I -- and I think --
L:  So, I guess that's a good part.
R:  Yeah.  And I can't -- I can't think of any negatives except for ah, you know, I don't know if it would happen, but if there are any type of mistrial or something like that and they have to try it again where if it were um publicized then they might have a harder time finding um you know people for the jury, you know, not having heard anything about it before.
L:  Oh yeah, for sure. [MN] Yeah.  Now, how would you feel if something happened to you and you were charged with a -- with a crime?
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  Of course you would be innocent [LAUGH].
R:  Right. [LAUGH] I know, like I d- --
L:  But --
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
L:  I sure wouldn't want to be on -- on TV in that case, but I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I feel it's like, you know, it's a -- it's a -- is it an invasion of -- of privacy to an extent, because, you know, maybe these people are guilty, but a lot of people just assume that they're no- that they're -- I mean, they're not -- they could be not guilty, is what I mean to say.
R:  Right.  Right.  I understand.
L:  But a lot of people assume that they are guilty just because, you know, they're in that courtroom and they've been charged.
R:  Right.  That would be hard because I mean it kinda brings into defamation of character if you were, um, not guilty.  Even, you know, even if the -- if the jury found you not guilty and you truly weren't guilty, not just a matter of, "I don't know what the jury was thinking" [LAUGH] but um --
L:  Yeah.  So, yeah, you're right --
R:  -- that -- that would be hard.
L:  -- it does.  If it's a -- a lot of people are ah -- you know, they don't bother to -- they get the first thing in their mind, your -- your character is besmirched forever.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Oh, for example, back in the um in -- I'm here in California and I know I wasn't here at the time, but I remember that there was a nursery school, um, childcare place that was at the mother and a father and the kids, or somebody, were all um charged with child molestation --
R:  Yeah, I think I remember that.
L:  -- and it turned out that they were all innocent, but they ruined their lives.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, I don't remember if that was -- if that was um on TV or not, it was televised or not, but certainly, you know, even if it wasn't, it had enough ah press --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- to ruin, I mean their lives were ruined forever.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  And I also think of like --
L:  So, I guess --
R:  -- um --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- the -- the Olympic um thing in Atlanta where I think his name was Richard Jewel -- I just remember his last name was Jewel --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I was in Atlanta at that time.
R:  Oh, were you?
L:  Richard Jewel, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, I mean and --
L:  But he was -- he was never officially charged, was he?
R:  No, but the -- I mean, they televised it like right away and so you know, apparently it really ruined his life because that's all people remember.  They don't remember the actual person that was -- I -- I'm pretty sure that they caught the person, but I -- I just know --
L:  Yeah, just -- just recently, yeah.
R:  -- I -- but I know that they um -- they did prove that he didn't do it, but that's not what people remember --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so ...
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, he was ruined too.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  He was ruined.
R:  Yeah.  That would be -- I didn't really think of it from the point of ah the person being accused, if they were not guilty.  That would be very difficult, you know, let alone to stand a trial and, you know, feel -- already feel upset that, you know, "I've been wrongly accused" but then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you had it televised, that would just, you know, just perpetuate your shame [LAUGH].  Even though you didn't do anything [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And ah and, you know, there's so many cases today where people do um, you know, the kids have such control over their parents, they can accuse the parents of -- of child molestation knowing that they'll get them in trouble ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they could -- that could again could ruin someone's life, or a mother could say something about her husband if she wants a divorce, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but so many -- it's -- it's so easy to -- to bring charges --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if they started televising, you know, the run of the mill case, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you could ruin a lot of people's lives.
R:  Oh yeah.  And it -- it's kind of a modern day witch hunt [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where, you know, things are being accused when they didn't really happen --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but people um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- being convicted, if you will, of -- of whatever, just because somebody said something.
L:  Right.
R:  Things that are hard --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to prove otherwise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  What -- have you ever studied -- you said you had not studied law or anything?
R:  No.  No.  I was an art major, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] very far away from law [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.  And which city are you in?
R:  I live in Huston, Texas.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm right outside of Los Angeles now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I'm from -- I'm from Georgia originally and I know I -- I know that there was also another famous case on in Atlanta with the um the child murderer, you know, they raped and murdered --
R:  Oh.  I remember that.  Yeah.
L:  -- young -- young boys.  I think it was mostly young boys being killed, um, in the ah African American community --
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Wayne Williams was his name.  See how we remember their names?  And that was, gosh, that had to be --
R:  That was a long time ago, because I was a child.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I  -- I was visiting --
L:  That had to be in our --
R:  Mhm.  I remember, I probably --
L:  And I remember his --
R:  -- was about ten or twelve.
L:  Gee, that's amazing how we remember their names.  I mean, and you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- whether he's guilty or not, you know, but I guess that's up to God to p- to take care of that punishment, but my goodness, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he was certainly --
R:  And it's a --
L:  -- he -- they wanted somebody bad [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.
L:  So that -- 
R:  Because I -- I'm sure that the -- the -- the different police departments et cetera that are investigating feel like, you know, they're under the microscope too because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they have the wrong person then, you know, they just let the -- the right person go free or, you know, let them go about their business and not be punished for their crime, so --
L:  Right.  So, I guess, you know, to -- to summarize what we've said is kinda -- we kinda do enjoy the ah the fact that -- that ah we can watch these type of things on TV because we do learn about the cour-
