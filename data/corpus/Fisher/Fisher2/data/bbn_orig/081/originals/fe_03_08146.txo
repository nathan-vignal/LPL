L:  Hi, my name is Gloria.
R:  Hi, my name's Marissa.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.  So --
L:  So, we're to talk about drugs?
R:  Apparently [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm all for random drug testing --
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I think that if you're working you definitely should -- well, I just don't think you should do drugs period, but, you know, if you're at work, I'm just -- I'm all for random drug testing [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I -- I have to agree, um, although I've never indulged in drugs, um, there are many companies, many jobs that you do that you have to be fully alert.
R:  Absolutely, my --
L:  [MN] And especially if you're working around um machinery, or -- or driving heavy equipment --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And -- and I think um if people know that they could be tested at any time, um, I th- I think maybe more cautious about it --
R:  I --
L:  -- not be using it.
R:  I agree.  I -- and you know I -- I work in the kind of a medical field and, you know, I know people that have, you know, smoked weed and stuff at work and I totally think they should have done drug testing, just random, and I know people that it bothers them that they do random but, you know, if you have nothing to hide, then you shouldn't worry about it and --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and who cares?  You know what I mean?  It [SIGH] it kills me that people are so upset about drug testing, I mean you just shouldn't be doing drugs when you're at work.
L:  No.  No.  You should not.  And if you --
R:  Me -- 
L:  -- if you are, and you get caught, well then, you don't deserve to have that job to begin with.
R:  Exactly.  It's your own fault.  You should have thought of that [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- in the first place.
L:  I -- there's certainly, you know, people out there who are not on drugs who could use a job.
R:  Absolu- -- oh yeah.  Definitely, there's a ton of people out there but, you know, I just know I'm -- I'm all for it.  I -- in fact, I think that they should do it more and more.  I wish my company did it, but they don't.  So --
L:  [NOISE] I've only ever had um one job where it's -- they tested you before you were hired.  But then they never tested anybody after that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, if you knew that you were going to be tested --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and you were taking them, um, you stay off them for a week or so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess that's all the longer it takes and um you're fine and then you're in that job and everybody else's lives could be in jeopardy.
R:  Exactly.  Well, and like I said, I, you know, I work in the medical field and so we deal with people's lives --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and their lives are put in jeopar- you know, jeopardy.  I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and you can't, you know, you just can't focus like that and yeah, there's just much better people to do the job rather than people that feel the need to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that do drugs and worry all the time about drug testing.
L:  I know.  Um, three years ago I had major heart surgery --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I certainly would not have wanted somebody taking care of me afterwards who was taking any kind of drugs.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah, just the thought is -- makes me sick --
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's scary.
R:  It is.  It really is.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, and you know, you see people that are on drugs and can't -- basically can't even really function without them, but they're not functioning on 'em and, you know, my field hires people like that 'cause we go through so many people, it just kills me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's -- it is, it's scary.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  But, yeah, I'm -- I'm all for drug testing [LAUGH].
L:  And I don't consider it an invasion of privacy.
R:  No, not at all.
L:  I really don't.
R:  And I think that a business has every right and it's -- no, it's not an invasion of privacy, they have every right to know if um, you know, their staff or employees --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are doing drugs and [NOISE] here, talk on that one.  But, um, yeah, I just -- it is an inva- -- it's not an invasion.
L:  No.  Not at all.  Like you said earlier, if, you know, if you're not taking them, you have nothing to worry about.
R:  Exactly.  But, ah, yeah --
L:  I mean, there's -- there's so much of it out there today.
R:  There -- oh, there is.  There's a ton of it out there and, you know, you just never know anymore and --
L:  No, no, you really don't.
R:  Yeah.  So, sometimes that's the only -- I mean, and sometimes people can be on drugs and you think that they're semi normal and that they're okay and they're not.
L:  They're not.  No.
R:  Yeah.  So, why not just make sure, you know?  Have that -- that one step further.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But ...
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't really know um too many people that I think would object to having it done, or who would look at it as an invasion of their privacy.  But I don't really know of anybody who -- anybody, actually, I said not too many people, but actually I don't know anyone who --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- who would object to it.
R:  Like I said, the only people who I know who it would bother are the people that are doing drugs.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  Anybody I've ever talked to, if they're doing drugs, it totally bothers them and they um, you know, think it's an invasion and et cetera, you know, and -- and ah -- but everyone else that doesn't do drugs, they -- they don't care.
L:  Like I'll tell you the truth, I don't know how they can exist with taking drugs --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because ah again, referring back to when I -- when I had surgery, um, there's so much of my stay in the hospital that I absolutely do not remember, ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- even to this day, you know, I'll be asking my son, or my daughter in law, questions --
R:  Well --
L:  -- and I know it was because of the drugs they had me on.
R:  Yeah.  Like you think about it and just semi mild, you know, pain medications, I mean I've had my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- share of surgeries and, you know, just even pain medications that people get addicted to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I can't think when I'm on 'em.  I can't function, I'm just totally out of it and, you know, and people do this all the time and work that way --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I -- I certainly would not want to be working with someone like that.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely not.
L:  You know, especially depending on -- I mean, suppose you were a police officer --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- you don't want somebody like that backing you up.
R:  Well, exactly.  But just, yeah, scary.
L:  It is very scary.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  But it doesn't look like it's ah letting up at all, either.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, I just -- I think more and more businesses need to take that next step because drugs are all over the place --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so ... ah it's just sad.
L:  It is.  It is very sad.  And like I said earlier, there's been a lot of people who could do a very good job without taking drugs --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- let them have those jobs.  And -- and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people who choose to take drugs, let them lose their job and do without.
R:  Yeah.  And let, yeah.  But, you know, they need the money [LAUGH].
L:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, they do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's for sure.  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, it's just sad that they have to take away from everyone else to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do that, you know, and I don't know, it's just -- it's terrible.  It's not very fair to anyone.
L:  No, no, it isn't.
R:  But, yeah, I'm -- I'm all for the drug testing and everything, bring it on, you know, and if you have nothing to hide then I think everybody would feel that way [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But ... I --
L:  Yeah, I'd like to see more of it.
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I -- I -- like I said, especially in my field, you know, and we deal with medications and ah psychological me- medications and things that staff could be stealing and taking and just saying that the clients have been taking 'em, you know, and that's scary.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, you'd think that they would do more drug testing in my field and they don't.  I don't understand it, but --
L:  Yeah, I do.  I would think that would be the very first field --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that would, ah, you know, really come out in favor of it.
R:  Yeah, there --
L:  I mean, that's lives you're dealing with.
R:  Well, you -- you'd think they'd just -- but they don't, you know, they ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in fact, I have never been -- I've been in my field for over six years now and not once have I been tested for drugs and I mean it wouldn't bother me if they did it, of course --
L:  If they did, right.
R:  -- but, yeah, they just have never done it.  So ... I don't know.
L:  [MN] The funny part of it is that the company that um that I worked for that did have the drug testing before you were hired was a very small company.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we didn't do anything, I mean, that was dangerous or involved anybody's life or ah you know, where if you were on drugs you would hurt someone, yet that was the company that wanted it done.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- it -- it just, you know, struck me as I mean, I worked for um my last job I worked for a landscaper --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and those guys were coming, if they ever pull a drug test there, they'd lose their whole crew in one day --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because those guys just, um, they -- they'd come in and I mean you know they were high --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they're out there with the -- the lawnmowers and the um, like small backhoes and -- and bulldozers, not large ones, but they still, they -- they could hurt someone.  And um now he -- he didn't believe in that.  As long as they showed up for work and um brought the equipment back in one piece.
