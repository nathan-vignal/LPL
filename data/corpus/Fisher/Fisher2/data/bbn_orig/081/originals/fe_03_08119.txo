R:  Hey there.  Rick from, uh, Denver, Colorado.
L:  Hi, Rick.  I'm Barb from Phoenix, Arizona.
R:  Nice to meet ya.
L:  You too.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, um, I'm sort of biased on this subject 'cause I'm a smoker.  So, um, this should be an interesting conversation.
L:  Well, I too smoke.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, at least we won't get into an argument. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  No, we won't.
R:  Um, I don't know.  I guess I'll start off.  As far as the banning of -- of public smoking in public places, um, I don't know.  I mean, if it's in a closed in area I can agree with that because I don't wanna, you know, give anyone else, you know, secondhand smoke and I don't wanna force my habit on anybody else.  But in regards to, you know, an open air, you know, place where, you know, you're not getting the secondhand smoke I do- I don't know.  I just think that's sort of a little Nazish[?] to be honest.  I think that it's a little too strict.  I think that, uh, you know, by people imposing their will upon, you know, other people and, you know, what they think is right and what they think isn't right, I don't think that   You know, I think that takes away from individual freedom.  So 
L:  I totally agree with you.
R:  Do you?
L:  Absolutely.  I, um, [COUGH] as far as   Like you said, in a closed in area I can agree with that, mostly because of children.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay?  Um, if it's strictly adults I -- I can still kind of see it.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  I realize they don't wanna smell it.  They don't wanna smell it when they leave.
R:  Right, but I -- I don't know.  It's like sort of when you go into a bar.  It's like sort of the atmosphere you expect.  You know what I mean?
L:  Well, exactly.  Exactly.  Um, I can see why they don't want people smoking like a cigar in a closed in place.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay?  But [MN], yeah, j- -- I agree totally.  If it's a -- if it's a bar I think you should be able to smoke but in these restaurants and things, especially family ones, I -- I can agree with the fact that they don't want you smoking in them.  Um, but just like you said too in -- in the outside area, the patio areas and things like that I think definitely smoking should be allowed.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I know we had an incident up here where they've -- they've got a -- a patio area and a lady was just totally upset because she felt she should be able to sit out there without smoke.
R:  Hm.
L:  And, of course, everybody else felt they should be able to sit out there with a cigarette and she can go inside.
R:  Right, right.  I don't know.  I -- I think it's like -- you know, it's like, you know, what's the next step after they do something like that, you know.  If you stink, you're not allowed in public places?  You know, if you --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know, if you say harsh, you know, language; you're not allowed in public places?  I mean, I do- -- I don't know.  It just [SIGH] -- it just seems that, you know, it's just getting so -- I mean, I can understand why people don't smoke, they don't like smoke.  Um, you know, but it's -- it's -- I mean, where -- where do you -- where do you cross the line?  Where do you draw the line?  You know.  I don't know.
L:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We don't smoke in our house. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and -- and that's -- that's for many reasons but mace, uh, mostly it was because of my kids.  Um, and now that they're grown it's because of their kids.  Um, but a- -- but that's our choice.
R:  Right, exactly.  Exactly and it's your property.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, it's   You know, and -- and -- and, you know, I can -- I can understand the argument that it's, you know, hazardous to your health but then again, I mean, what's the next step there?  I mean, do you -- do you outlaw sun tanning? [LAUGH]  I mean --
L:  Well --
R:  Sun tanning is --
L:  They should.
R:  You know, seriously.  I mean --
L:  They know sun tanning causes cancer.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  And they know that several of the food additives cause cancer.
R:  Right.  Saccharin.
L:  Uh, it's stupid.  They know that if you get into a car and drive you can get in an accident.
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah.  It's -- it's just gone too far.  I truly believe that the constitution has just been misconstrued and pushed around to meet other people's --
R:  Well, the majority.  I mean, it all comes down to what the majority, or the what they call, you know, the silent majority, what they think other people should do and I -- and infringing on a personals -- on a person's personal liberties --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It just goes -- it goes too far.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It truly goes too far.
L:  Absolutely.  I don't think the constitution was meant to be [NOISE] twisted the way it's being twisted. [NOISE] 
R:  No.
L:  I think it was a very general thing that these people are taking too far. [NOISE] It's -- it's, uh, it's insane.
R:  And as far as --
L:  And I'm having a cigarette now and nobody's gonna complain about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know, it's sort of like prohibition, you know, when they outlawed alcohol, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, people did it anyway, huh?
R:  Exactly.  It's not -- it's not gonna stop anybody.
L:  Same thing here with these taxes they're tacking onto cigarettes now. 
R:  Oh, god.  Well --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's just it.  I mean, every   I mean, they're making it difficult enough for smokers to, you know, smoke or, you know.  I mean, it just -- I don't know it ju- -- I think it's ridiculous that, you know, it -- they pick one thing and they just, you know, you know, they sort of just themed[?] on it.  They just -- they just obsess on it when [MN] I don't know.  I mean, they know that there's been studies done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, that second hand smoke can cause cancer but, you know, I --
L:  But I don't know if you've read lately but they've been saying, "No, maybe it doesn't".
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, I've been -- I've been [NOISE] reading some articles and I don't know what station I was watching, I heard it on there and that made me kind of look online for it --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and I saw a couple of different articles on line where they said, "Well, maybe we were wrong".
R:  Wow.
L:  So, [MN] you know, I don't know either way whether it does or not but   Uh 
R:  But then again in an open air area I seriously doubt I'm   You know, I would bet -- I would bet anything that out in a park or, you know, out on the street the carbon monoxide you're getting from the -- the cars driving by is probably more harmful than the cigarette smoke of a person walking by.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [MN] In all seriousness.  I mean, are you gonna outlaw, you know, um, um, you know, uh, gas burning engines because of the carbon monoxide?
L:  They could try. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean -- I mean, in, you know, and it would -- you know, and that gets you -- gets me into a, you know, an entirely different subject of, you know, when it comes down to it.  You know, people can die as long as it's economically efficient.  I mean, that's what America's based on.  It's based on money.  So, I mean, it's   You know, if -- if -- if they could convert, you know, all the cars to electric I'm sure they would if it didn't cost much but it's gonna -- it would cost a bundle and there's no way they would outlaw it because of the cost involved.
L:  Right.  And because most of the politicians like to ride around in great big huge vehicles.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know, [MN] I don't know.  I just -- I just think that it's all come down to an obsession of people that don't smoke.  You know, these --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or -- or even worse, the people that quit smoking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean, they're -- they're just, you know, they're worse than people that, you know, never smoked, you know, at all in their life.
L:  Oh, I know.  I know.  They surely are.  Well, I was reading, uh, gosh it was a couple of months ago [NOISE] where there were these, uh, animal rights activists [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that were complaining because, uh, they said that their animals were getting second hand smoke.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my god.
L:  And I'm like, "Where the hell are your animals getting it?" [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that's a riot.
L:  Now, I know they're not in the restaurants. [LAUGH] You know. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] That is too funny.  Are you kidding me?  Really?
L:  No, no, no, no.  But it's just like down here we have a law, uh, you can't have your dog or any animal in the back of your -- your pickup truck but there's no law about having your children back there.
R:  Really?
L:  True.  My -- my hus- --
R:  That's -- you know what that?  That is just so par for the course.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  People caring more about, you know, their dogs than they do sometimes their kids. [MN] I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I swear. [SIGH] You know, that's just a -- [MN] I think that's just hilarious and sad at the same time.
L:  Well, I love my dog too but if I'm in the car with a cigarette, he puts his nose out the window anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Regardless of whether you're smoking or not.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it's and -- and you know anybody that gets in my car whether they're a smoker or not, they know that I am.
R:  Right.
L:  And they have the choice to get in and I've never had a non fo- smoking friend say, "Well, I'm not gonna get in your car".
R:  No, I mean, and plus I, you know, when I have somebody in the -- in the car I roll down the window anyway.
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  So, I mean, it's not like the car's getting --
L:  I do too and I don't -- I don't necessarily smoke if there is a non smoker in the car but 
R:  Right, same here.  I mean, I try -- I -- I think -- I think most people nowaday -- in all seriousness I think most people nowadays who smoke are courteous smokers.
L:  I agree.  I agree.
R:  [MN] Really.
L:  And I think that those that aren't are probably just so fed up with everything that they don't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You know, i- it's, uh --
R:  You're made to feel like a heroin addict or something sometimes.  I swear.
L:  Yeah.  I know the, uh, Military Commissary a few years ago wanted to quit selling cigarettes.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  I was in the Marines.
L:  Oh, I'm retired Air Force.
R:  Are you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  And I
