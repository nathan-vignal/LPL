R:  Hello?
L:  H- hi, I'm Christina.
R:  Hey, I'm Marius.  
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  [MN] Nice to meet you.  Do you understand what's today topic?
L:  Uh, yeah, it's the censorship and in -- in public and private schools, I guess, to, um, censor what they can and can't read, I guess --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- is what it is.  
R:  [NOISE] Okay, so what do you think about it?
L:  Well, um, I went to a private school and, um, you know, we had certain books that -- that we had to read for class, and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they were -- they were all good choices, but, um, I remember that -- that, uh, you know, reading, like, in some schools, they wouldn't allow certain books because of certain words that they would use, or because of certain topics.  And I don't [SIGH] -- I don't know --
R:  What --
L:  -- what -- I'm sorry?
R:  -- what kind of books?  What kind of books [MN] they didn't allow?
L:  Um, well, we, uh, for example, in high school, um, there were some books that -- that we had to read, uh, there was one called Their Eyes Were Watching God, by Zora Neil Hurston --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was -- it was about, um, uh, slaves, I guess, during, uh, during the eighteen hundreds.  And they, um, [LIPSMACK] you know -- and -- and the book was -- was very difficult to read actually, because the dialect was -- was exactly the way they spoke, and so it was very phonetic as opposed to the way the words are actually spelt.  So, you would get a really good feel of what they sounded like and in that respect I thought the book was excellent, it was just very hard to read.  But we had a lot of good choices in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the books that -- that we were given, so -- so that was, you know, good for us.  We didn't have a lot of, you know, censored books that we couldn't read.
R:  Okay, but do you agree with the idea of censoring books in, uh --
L:  No --
R:  -- in school?
L:  -- no, I -- I don't, I don't.
R:  [MN] Okay, me neither.
L:  Okay.
R:  We've got the same, uh -- I'm -- I'm asking [MN], because I believe that, uh, everyone should be able to read whatever he wants and then [SIGH] he will decide if [several inaudible words] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- your learning experience.
L:  Exactly.  Because, I mean, it's not like -- just because they censor the book in school, it's not like you can't go to, let's say, the public library or somewhere, you know, a book store, and buy the book and read it yourself.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] You know, it's like they're trying -- you know, the -- it's almost like they're taking the choice away from you.  They're taking the, [SIGH] you know, decision to read it away from you and they're telling you what you can and can't read, and I don't agree with that.
R:  And do you try -- at your school, do you try and talk to the management about some things like this?  About censorship and [MN] so forth?
L:  Well, I -- I never actually did, because, like I said, you know, we never had a problem with that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not like they would say, you know, "Oh, you can't read this".  They actually encouraged us to -- to read as many books as possible, you know.  Over the summer they would give us, like, some books to read and, you know, we would -- we would discuss them and have discussions on them and -- and -- and, I mean, some of these books were not [SIGH] -- you know, because a lot of times they -- they, you know, censor books because, like I was saying, you know, certain word, you know, like a -- like a, you know, the word that they -- that they call black people, you know, starting with an N.  I don't exactly wanna say it right now, because this is being recorded, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, a word like that, it's like -- it's not like they don't know it exists.  It's not like some of these topics they don't know exist --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if you censor it, they're gonna wanna read it even more.  And it's just -- it's like with anything, you know, it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [MN] it's a forbidden fruit.  The more -- the more you take it away, the more they're gonna want it, you know?  
R:  Yeah.  You're absolutely right [LAUGH].
L:  That's what I say.
R:  Okay, I read an article, uh, [MN] I don't know, a few days ago, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- about, um, [LIPSMACK] [inaudible] -- there's some guidelines, [SIGH] when you publ- -- when, uh, they publish, uh, books for kids, by teachers, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] they -- they're not allowed to show pictures with, uh, with, like, one woman in the kitchen --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or, if it's a group picture, it has to be [MN] at least, uh, twenty five per cent [inaudible] should be, uh, minorities.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And do you think this is, uh, censorship or not?
L:  Um, I -- I think it is --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- because I -- I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to almost -- it's -- it's such a silly concept really, because all these things that they're trying to censor -- you know, the world has become so, you know, quote politically correct --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that, you know, they think that they have to do it a certain way.  And what they don't realize is a lot of the time people don't care.  I mean, it's not like, you know, we don't know what's going on.  It's not like we don't know, you know, what the opposite of that would be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  I mean, it used to be that the woman's place, you know, was in the kitchen, but, you know, with women's rights and everything like that, now it's not.  And that's just the way it is.  [SIGH] But just showing a picture of a woman in a kitchen doesn't, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we know that's how it used to be, and, you know, that [MN] -- I don't -- I don't understand what the point of that is, you know?  
R:  [several inaudible words] argument is if they keep showing pictures like this, uh, you have in your subconscious, you know, and the image of the women in the kitchen [SIGH] so you'll always associate, [MN] uh, the women [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, you know -- you know what that does, though?  That undermines the hu- -- a human being's intellect.  That undermines --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- your -- your, you know, i- it makes you -- it makes you basically think that they're -- they're calling you stupid in a way, because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, it's like, you know, you should be smarter to -- to know.  You know, you should know better than that, and it's like --
R:  I totally agree with you [LAUGH].
L:  -- you know?  I -- I mean, just out of curiosity, where are you from?
R:  Uh, I'm from Romania.
L:  From Romania?  I'm -- I'm -- I'm Polish.  I -- I was born here, but, uh, but I'm first generation, so I speak Polish, and I was just -- I was just curious about where you were from.
R:  Mm, yeah [MN]. 
L:  Well, how -- I'm just curious -- how -- how is all of this kind of situation in -- in Europe, because I don't know, you know, that -- that much.  Is it --
R:  The censorship?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm -- I'm sure it's a lot less, right?
R:  Yeah, [MN] we have no problems, no, uh, in the whole Eastern Europe.  The press is free, right now --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- so I think this is, like, the main, uh, I don't know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the -- the most important thing [several inaudible words] after -- after all this communist power.
L:  Right, right.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Because I know -- I know, like, every time I -- I've gone to Poland in the last few years, you know, I'm always [SIGH] so cert- -- you know, surprised that it -- it's -- and I see so many [MN] -- so much less of the problems that we have in America --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, in -- in Europe.  Like, they don't have a [MN] -- all the -- the sorts of problems we do, because I think that that's definitely one of the reasons.  They don't try [SIGH] -- they don't try to limit you unnecessarily.  They don't try to tell you, you know, as much, what you can and can't do, should and shouldn't do --
R:  [MN] Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  And I --
R:  It seems the same in the whole Europe.  It's not only in the Eastern Europe, it's much more --
L:  Yeah, and all --
R:  -- liberal than here [LAUGH].
L:  -- [MN] exactly, exactly.  Like, for example, you know, another topic of censorship is, of course, you know, what -- what you can and can't see on TV, you know, what they can and can't show, et cetera, et cetera.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think, like, for example, you know, [MN] just showing, like -- like, let's say, like, nudity or -- or, you know, certain -- certain types of scenes like that.  I just think it's so much more -- they're so much more open minded in -- in Europe, and they don't make as big of a deal about it.  Here in America --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's like, it's -- it's -- it's -- we're like hypocritical because, you know, we have, let's say, all this pornography and all this other stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But on the other hand we're such prudes as a society, everything is so prudish, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Oh, no, you know, you can't see a breast.  Oh, no, they're showing that", you know?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, "Oh, my gosh".  Come on, the bigger deal you make about it, then the bigger deal it's gonna be.  And people are gonna, you know, turn it into that and I just think that's so stupid.  
R:  [MN] Yes.
L:  You know?  It's -- it's -- it's -- it's just [SIGH] -- it's just, it's -- you know, it's -- it's silly.  It really is silly.  And I -- and [MN] it's -- it's always so, you know, obvious, and -- and I just, I don't know.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, like -- like, last night I was watching -- I was watching a program, it was on -- on Comedy Central, it wa- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was a comedic thing, it was one of the, um, [SIGH] the Flyers Club Roasts that they had, and -- and I think it was, uh, either for, like, Jerry Stiller or, um, I can't remember who the other person was, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, every -- they -- they would curse and, I don't know, you know, what the prob- -- you know, I understand that, you know, when -- if it's like a, you know, it's a family channel, you know, that -- that people, you know, don't want their kids to be listening to people, like, cursing and everything, but then again [SIGH] if it's late at night, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a lot of, you know, kids are already in bed, and it's -- and another thing, it's not like these kids don't know these words, and it's not like they're not already using them.  I -- I see all around, like, just walking around, I see little kids, like, ten year olds that are -- that curse more than I do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  And they're -- and yet, they're trying to limit the amount of cursing or -- or whatever that they're listening to on TV or hearing on the radio.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's like, "Come on, are -- are you really, like, blind?"  It's like people have, like, blinders over their eyes.  They don't realize [SIGH] that these kids already know the words, they're just not gonna let their parents know that they already listen to all this stuff.  That they don't listen to it at home because their parents don't let them, [SIGH] they'll go somewhere else and listen to it, you know?
R:  Yes [MN] --
L:  Or to see it or whatever.
R:  -- because everything -- everything's always freely available on the internet, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they can have access to everything there.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  And I just, you know, it's -- it's -- it's -- it's absurd, really.  So, I -- I don't agree with censorship.  Maybe [SIGH] -- maybe in extreme cases, you know, something.  And another example also of it is, like, in -- in the news, I mean, even in the news it comes into play.  Like, for example, after September eleventh, I remember --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I was here, uh, when it happened, and, uh, you know, on TV they would show you certain things but, you know, obviously there were certain things that they would leave out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because of the sensitivity of it.  Because, you know, especially here in New York, you know, people, you know, didn't necessarily wanna see all that stuff, because we lived through it.  You know, we were right there [SIGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I remember, I went, like, in December, like, a few months later, I went to -- to Poland, and I was watching the news there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they were being so much more graphic in -- in what they were showing, and the footage that they were showing.  I mean, they were showing people that were really bloody --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just, kind of, you know, they were showing more, you know, of the people, you know, jumping out of the buildings.  And I mean, they were being a lot more graphic with it, and, I mean, even in the -- what do you think about censorship in the news?  I mean, we all have a right to know what's going on, you know, so don't --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  -- don't tell us, you know, don't -- don't take away the choice of seeing it.  I mean, we can always turn off the TV or change the channel if we don't wanna see it, but [SIGH] don't take that option away from us.  You know, what do you think?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I -- what I saw here on the -- here on the news review was --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they don't -- they have, um -- it's like, um, indirect censorship.  They only show, like, local news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] on all these, uh, channels that I get.  I don't have cable at home, so I just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, [MN] get whatever, uh, whatever is available on the free market.
L:  Right, okay, right.
R:  So, I [MN] only see the weather [LAUGH] --
