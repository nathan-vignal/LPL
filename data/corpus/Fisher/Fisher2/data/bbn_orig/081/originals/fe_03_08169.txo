L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- she thought it was -- she thought it was a lot of fun, yeah.
L:  Good, because I was kind of scared about giving my social security number on the Internet.
R:  Yeah.  No, no, I understanding is there it's extremely secure.  We don't have to worry about it at all.

R:  Yeah.  So, I think -- I think it's kind of a neat thing.  I'm going to have my son do this too.
L:  We just talk for ten minutes?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just talk for ten minutes about that, about that subject. But do you know what, I had a hard time understanding her questions, is it --
L:  Me --
R:  -- an echo --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know what [inaudible] family values and [several inaudible words] you think the divorce rate has um --
L:  That's what I heard, too, divorce rate, something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Has --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- how -- how it's affected our lives.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, has it affected yours?
L:  No.  My parents are still together.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's excellent.  Well, it's affected mine --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- because I'm divorced.  I'm married now, but yes, I'm -- I'm divorced and I -- even got -- I think it's [inaudible] affected ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I bet you know a lot of people who are divorced, a lot of people whose um parents are divorced?
L:  Oh, I know [inaudible] people, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Now, that -- that -- that's [inaudible] um, well where -- where -- well, not -- I'm not [inaudible] asking you where you went to school, how did you go to school?  You went to r- high school and graduated then you're in college now?
L:  Yeah.  I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, I graduated in two thousand one and now I've just finished --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my summer yeah at [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  -- going into my junior.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's very good.
L:  Thanks.
R:  Well, both my kids were home schooled.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes, they're -- and they're both in college now, but um what they found when they got out into the world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, was a lot of -- lot of people, you know, whose parents have divorced --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it isn't -- it wasn't so much that I protected them from that, you know, they -- we just didn't see it.  There were -- most home schoolers that we knew, not all, but most of them, you know, were from um two parent families.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but -- but it was real -- I think it -- I think it has affected everything profoundly.
L:  Oh, I'm sure, I mean --
R:  You know?  So, well how d- -- does it -- well, you see, I'm asking you this before you're -- you're that age, you're twenty years old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  Does it affect your view of marriage?
L:  Oh.  Completely.  Actually.
R:  What do you think?
L:  Um -- [MN] well, I think it's kinda sad that with the percentage now, fifty percent of America --
R:  Well, that's what -- yeah, that's what they say.
L:  -- um, is divorced and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean my best friend actually went through, her parents got divorced --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- after twenty five years of marriage.
R:  Oh.  Oh.  That's awful.
L:  Yeah.  So, she w- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she was fifteen at the time, with a brother --
R:  Oh my.
L:  -- who was fourteen and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and eleven, I believe.
R:  Oh.  My goodness.
L:  Yeah.  So I remem- --
R:  My goodness.  That means they waited long enough to have kids, too.
L:  Ah, yeah.  I guess so.
R:  You know?  And then still -- and then got divorced.
L:  Yeah.  It was twenty three marriages --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- twenty three years.  But regardless, it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a pretty long time [LAUGH].
R:  That's right.  It was a -- well, that is.  That's a long time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.  That's really -- 
L:  So --
R:  -- that's -- mhm.
L:  Yeah, she was my best friend, so we went through all that together.
R:  Oh, that was horrible.  Bet she was devastated, wasn't she?
L:  She -- she was actually, I remember we went to summer camp together, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they came up to camp to tell her --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about it and it was just the whole dramatic experience, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  They came and told her at summer camp?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  They couldn't even wait till she got home?
L:  I guess not.  I don't know.  I think she was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- suspecting something, but they just kind of --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, that's right.  Don't think that when you're that age, too, when you're fifteen, that it comes at a total shock, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  It still wouldn't be pleasant.  But --
L:  But it was, you know, her summer and everything.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Right.  But you have -- but you have two -- you have two parents still -- still together, huh?
L:  Yeah, they're still together.  I have --
R:  Very, very good.
L:  --I have an older brother I mean --
R:  That's good.  That -- that's good.  They're likely to stay together.
L:  Well, yeah, I'm sure about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They definitely -- because, oh, I mean, it doesn't mean [several inaudible words] you know [LAUGH].
R:  No.  Oh, you -- but you have problems.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's what life is, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Life is, you know, problems et cetera, but it's a matter of working them out instead of getting divorced.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes, because it was --
L:  So you have children then?
R:  Yes.  Yes.  I have children, yeah.
L:  With your first husband?
R:  Yeah, with my first husband, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yes.  And ah they're ah well twenty two and nineteen.  My daughter's almost twenty.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And um, you know, so they're really the same age as you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um and it was um -- I know it's horrible.  It was horrible for them.
L:  Mm.
R:  [several inaudible words] I always tell them, don't um -- it's horrible --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- it's just horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Don't get divorced.
L:  Do you still keep in touch --
R:  You -- now don't --
L:  -- with your ex husband?
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's relatively amicable.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, amicable as can be.  You know.  But, no, he's a good dad, you know.  He's -- he's always, you know, always seeing 'em and taking care of 'em, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you know et cetera.  So it's not like it is with a lot of them, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, so many of my friends, I -- I can't even imagine the kinds of feelings that their kids are growing up with because ah they have contact with their fathers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no, none at all.  Their fathers didn't pay child support --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I get why my husband.  Um, his parents were divorced.  P- probably at about that same age as your friend, I think he was maybe, he was probably fifteen or sixteen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he had a younger brother and sister and um oh I mean when his father was gone, his father was gone --
L:  Right.  He never talked to him again.
R:  -- you know.  Yeah, that's it.  I mean, he -- he did, but not there was no -- he wasn't a father after that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, he never paid child support --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'll tell you, it's a -- it had a horrible effect on that family.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I mean I -- I think the family was having its troubles anyway.
L:  [MN] Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  You know.  But it just -- it just had a horrible -- it had a horrible effect on him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, not to have a father around.  And eventually his mother remarried, you know, and married to a very nice man that she's still married to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's um, I -- I don't know.  I think it has a worse effect and I can't help but wonder, you know, especially, especially, you know, from -- from um well kids, I'm sorry to use the word --
L:  That's okay [LAUGH].
R:  -- kids like you --
L:  That's okay.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, um, who feel this the what you think of marriage.  I mean, do you think of it as permanent?
L:  Personally I like to.  You know, I still -- I have that ideological sense that it's, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] kind of thing [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Well, that -- that doesn't quite happen.
L:  No.
R:  You know --
L:  You know, I think that --
R:  -- oh, they sweep you off your feet, but --
L:  -- I think that's kind of disturbing because, you know, in the movies kids grow up, they see pop culture with it's [inaudible] you know, like happy marriages and everything and they think that kind of --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- distorts reality for them.
R:  Right.  Well, do you know what to, I think, because people don't maybe understand what happy marriage is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Happy marriage doesn't mean you never fight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, and that you don't have serious problems --
L:  Right.
R:  -- happy marriage means you make a commitment to each other [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  And you stay together and you get through those bad times --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know and -- and here I am talking, I'm divorced.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  But it -- but it's [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I learned some things.
L:  Would you -- would you [inaudible] --
R:  You know, I -- I t- I -- I learned to ah don't be stupid.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know.  That it's ah -- it's a precious thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  You -- you -- you find someone that you love who loves you, it's a precious thing.  But that it takes an enormous amount of work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  And that -- but it's not -- that a lot of people say it ah w- w- means it's difficult.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it doesn't.  That's not what it means at all.
L:  Right.
R:  It just means it's work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, realizing that somebody else is different and the communication is difficult.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you just -- you just work at it.  You know, you just keep working at it and you decide that you're going to work at it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No matter what.  You're not going to -- you're going to give up, you're not going ah -- you're not going to look elsewhere, you're just going to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're going to stick with them no matter what.  And then you reap the benefits, I think.
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, I think to me --
R:  What --
L:  -- it's just the idea of, you know, picking one person to spend the entire -- your entire life with.
R:  Entire rest of your life with.  Yeah.
L:  You know.  And what's the average age now, twenty five, twenty six?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's not even a quarter --
R:  That's right.  Yeah --
L:  -- like more than -- little more than a quarter of your life, you know, so --
R:  That's right.  Exactly.  E- e- exactly.  Have you been involved in a serious relationship?
L:  Yeah, I've been involved in a couple actually that kind of bit me in the butt in fact, but I've --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that I've kind of thought, you know, well this is the guy, this is the guy, this is the guy and I think that's what scares me about marriage, the divorce, is that there's this preconceived notion --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that you need to find this guy that's, you know, perfect man, this perfect family.
R:  The perfect one.
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's right.
L:  He needs to fit the qualifications and it -- it doesn't work like that.
R:  No, no, it doesn't.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Does -- doesn't.  It doesn't quite work that way.  But it's still very pleasant, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, I truly thought I would never get married again.  I'll tell you that.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You know.  I really did think I would never get married again.  It -- it took me completely by surprise to meet somebody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I wasn't looking, I wasn't --
L:  You -- you know, that's how everyone says it happens, when you're not looking.
R:  Yes.  Yeah, really, and you know, I didn't really believe people [LAUGH].
L:  I don't either, to be honest.
R:  But yeah, you know, I didn't but -- but apparently they're right.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because -- because everybody I know says the same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that -- that really that's how it is when you're not -- when you're not looking, you're not -- you're busy concentrating on life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, on what you -- what you have to do.  You say you're stu- you're studying journalism?
L:  I'm a communications and journalism major, yeah.
R:  Oh, how, that's very inter- what would you like to do?  I realize this isn't on the topic but --
L:  It's okay.  
R:  You know.
L:  I don't think they'll kill us --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I think I'd like to go into broadcast news.  Right now I work in production at um --
R:  Mhm.  Oh, how interesting.
L:  -- yes, really -- I work at As the World Turns, the soap opera.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's fantastic.
L:  Yeah, it's so much fun.  It's really great.
R:  I've a -- oh, you know what, you're going to meet wonderful people like --
L:  Oh, thank you.
R:  -- too, you are.  Oh, you are.  You're going to -- you're going to meet so many interesting people.
L:  You know, it's fun as far as production goes I don't do much, I'm just, you know, run -- gofer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- do this, do that, but --
R:  Oh hey, that's great though.
L:  -- everyone's got to start somewhere, right?
R:  That -- oh, yeah, that's -- that's exactly right.  Everybody does have to start --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- somewhere.
L:  So --
R:  Oh dear.  And then, to get us back on the
