L:  Alyssa.
R:  Hi, it's Maryanna.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good [NOISE].  So, what do you think about smoking ads and -- and all the things that they're trying to ban?
R:  Um, I think, you know, I think it could be -- it's [SIGH] I'm not a smoker, so [LAUGH].
L:  Well, neither am I [LAUGH].
R:  So, I think it's kind of you know good because ah you know I -- I hate it when you go out to eat and there's people smoking and even --
L:  Yeah, 'cause even -- even -- unless the restaurant basically has two sides, with a wall in between, you can still smell it.
R:  Yeah and you can even sometimes you can even smell it when there's a smoking section and a non smoking section --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you're seated like right along the middle.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Or you go in and it's smoking, non smoking or first available and to get into smoking is like two minutes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and non smoking you have to wait, so you end up going over there and [LIPSMACK] yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- I'm totally for it.  I don't -- I don't really mind if people do it outside as much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but indoors I think is just -- is just too much for people who don't smoke and -- and because of the second hand smoke, all the studies that they've come out with with that, I don't -- I just don't think it's fair to people who don't smoke that don't want that in their lungs or the kids.
R:  Exactly, yeah, that's what I always say, like I don't have kids but like you see all these families that go out to eat and then you have to like you know either walk through a smoking section --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you know, they know what it's doing to adults and that --
L:  But --
R:  -- and can you imagine a kid that's around smoking?
L:  Exactly.
R:  What they're going to be like in like twenty years or whatever.
L:  Exactly.  Uh-huh.  Because I have some friends who smoke and they smoke right around their kids and I know, I mean like in- includes cars and everything and you know those kids are getting it in their lungs and then, I mean my Mom my wh- -- the whole time I grew up, but basically threatened to chop my hands off if I ever did it myself [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  So, I didn't -- I didn't -- I never did, but um I have a lot of friends who do and I just -- I don't think, I mean, everybody should have the freedom to do what they want to do in that respect but I just think when it -- when it +impugns on other peop- -- other people's um, you know, good time out for the -- I just don't think it's a very good idea.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I can't stand either how like if you go out to a bar, whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you come home --
L:  How you stink when you come home.
R:  -- and you reek, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like you can't even like, you have to take a shower and wash your hair the next day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just to go to work, because --
L:  Or even to go to bed.  I can't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if I go and something if you're wearing something that's -- has to be dry cleaned --
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then you have to -- I hang my coat outside when I go to places --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- smells like smoke.  Yeah, I'm the same way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And a lot of people like to -- to drink and smoke in a bar and stuff, but there's a lot of people who don't, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And my Grandma died of lung cancer two years ago, strictly from smoking all her life --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and so I'm hoping that puts a -- I mean, my son saw her go through hospice and my Mom's house and everything and I totally told him that's what it was from and -- and hopefully he'll -- he'll remember that, but my Mom stopped smoking the day that she found out her Mom -- her Mom had cancer and she hasn't smoked since.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- these kids are starting, I mean I'm -- we go to the movie theaters and we see these kids like eight and nine --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- out there smoking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so --
R:  I think the -- you know, like you s- you said that your -- your Mom stopped smoking like I think that there should be more like -- there has to be like celebrities or some people that are dying of lung cancer --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- and that somebody should kind of like be -- you know, the spokesperson to be like --
L:  Like --
R:  -- you know, instead of all the smoking ads and all the smoking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like you go out to a bar, I've -- I can't even tell you how many times like Marlboro or Parliament, they come up to you in the bar and they want -- they give you lighters or they give you like --
L:  Really?
R:  -- like windbreakers, yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  To sign up --
L:  Where are --
R:  -- on their mailing list.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  And like they send you all this, like when I was in college I did it because I was like, "Oh, cool, free stuff".
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I've heard about that.
R:  And now I'm on like a mailing list for Parliament.  They send me like junk all the time.  
L:  It --
R:  They -- they never send you cigarettes, but it's like you know --
L:  See, I think it's a good idea too that they're raising the cigarette tax --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it's making the people who smoke mad [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.
L:  And they're not wanting to buy it, but you know, you know, if that's what it takes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- but I don't know if they -- they don't have smoking ads on TV for -- for smoking though, do they?
R:  Mm --
L:  I think it's just magazines from what I've seen.
R:  Yeah, just magazines and like they have billboards and stuff.
L:  And then I like -- have you seen that new um [LIPSMACK] campaign --
R:  The t- -- the truth campaign? [NOISE] 
L:  Ah, I think -- I'm not sure if that's what it is.  Something about stop or something.  It's on the Internet, oh, something with your hand.  I've seen that on there and that like -- it -- it's usually kids and -- and celebrities --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like teenagers and stuff --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- saying that -- oh, stand.  Stand up, I think that's what it's called.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, what's the truth campaign?
R:  [NOISE] That's like the things on -- they're like really weird commercials.  Like they have the -- how these people and they'll dump like all this paper and they say, "This is what a billion dollars looks like and this is what, you know, cigarette people profit from yearly" --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- like it's these strange like really weird like things and then there's like one with like a -- like a baby doll and it -- it says like, "Which doll -- which -- if this was a real child, which one would you prefer?" and one's like really, really small and one's like a normal sized baby and it's like --
L:  Oh, if you're pregnant.
R:  -- this is what you -- you -- your baby will look like if you smoke when you're pregnant, or whatever.
L:  See, yeah, I think -- I think those are good because it -- it shows people for real because people think, "Oh, if I smoke then no big deal" --
R:  Right.
L:  They have everything that they need to keep me fine when I'm pregnant.  I -- I go by this billboard that has this woman who's very, very pregnant on it and -- and you can see through her blouse to her belly, she's w- -- I think she might be wearing like a nightgown and it says right above it, non smoking section, which I thought's a pretty good ad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I didn't get it at first and then I realized what it was, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I know that there's people who -- who can get in trouble for -- if they do drugs while they're pregnant --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they find um drugs in the baby -- who's there?  They find drugs um in a baby's bloodstream when they're born, they can actually be charged but ah they don't do that with nicotine.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm sure that there's got to be some study that when the kid comes out that there's something, because the nicotine's very addicting, from what I've been told.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, see I'm -- I actually live in Philadelphia but I -- I go to New York pretty frequently --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you can't smoke there the f- there you can't smoke in like bars or restaurants.
L:  Really?
R:  And apparently my Mom was telling me that um even if you go outside the bar, like you can still get a fine on the street.  Like you can't even smoke on the street.
L:  Really?
R:  Like right outside of the front of a restaurant.
L:  Yeah, they're getting real strict where I work.  Um, they had all these different things for smoking and -- and the -- outside and -- and um then they kept taking it down further and further because people were complaining, plus people were just throwing their buds in -- in the summer -- I live in Ohio and when we have those droughts --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, they drop 'em still lit and it was catching stuff on fire.
R:  On fire, right.
L:  And so they had -- at one point they had it where you had to go out in your car and smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and now they have [LAUGH] they have this little squared off area outside the dock that has um orange cones around it and that's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the only place that you're allowed to smoke.  But, you know, when people come and get on the elevator --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it just reeks of it.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  And you're on the elevator like, "Oh, I can't handle this" [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  And like, you know, years back they used to smoke inside when you were working.
R:  Right.
L:  And people who didn't have offices if you were working in cubicles, I just cannot imagine that.
R:  Oh, I know.  That's disgusting.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I think -- I'm thirty three and I don't think since I've been working which was since I'm, you know, fifteen, I don't remember people smoking within offices.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I know just not too long before that that was a very common thing.  I mean, in my Dad's office we used to go in and people would be smoking cigars.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I -- I haven't -- I'm only -- I'm twenty six --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I haven't -- I've never seen anybody like kind of smoking inside, but it's still -- I just --
L:  Well, I know, people where I work, well, they have to take, I mean we're allowed two breaks a day and a lunch, but they take four or five.  Because they have to go out and have a cigarette.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And they have to have a cigarette after they eat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have to have a cigarette if they're out drinking, you know, it's all associated with certain things and then a lot -- I've had a lot of friends who say, including my Mom, that -- that it's -- if they quit smoking, they'd gain weight.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because if -- if they don't have that -- that cigarette in their mouth all the time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so they eat.  But I've had a lot of friends who -- who um start smoking just so they can lose weight.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  It's like, yeah, you'll lose weight, but you'll also have cancer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I think if they showed like what an actual lung looked like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of like a black lung --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for -- for people who um have been smoking for a long time, what it looks like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I've heard really no matter how old you are, if you quit smoking it can start taking like ten years at a time off of your like smoke life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  From what I've heard.
R:  Ah, I remember reading so- -- I think I read that somewhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We used to have like these prevention things in school like when I was in elementary school, about smoking and like drugs and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they showed us like a video --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um where they showed us like a lung and it was like, it's literally black.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, disgusting.
L:  Oh, I mean I've told -- like, well, my best friend smokes a lot and she went through my Grandma's cancer, I mean we found that my Grandma had cancer in July, found out it was f- um, stage four cancer, which there's -- there's no way to help someone with that and she was seventy nine and um they said six to eight months and she died two months later.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  And ouch, and um I f- I thought that would -- that would really -- because my -- my friend was very close to my Grandma as well and I thought that that would help her and it didn't -- didn't touch it.  Now, my Mom stopped --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, that day, um, that we found out and it was like right around July fourth a couple of years ago and she's wanted it here and there, but whenever she thinks about her Mom -- because she basically for the two weeks that she was in her lower level with um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hospice, she was trying to catch her breath the whole time --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and -- and till the day she died she would just yell out, screaming, because she had no more oxygen left --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she thought it was her time to go.
R:  Right.
L:  And then -- then you know, they woke up one m-
