L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  M- --
R:  Who's this?  S- --
L:  This is Linda.
R:  Hi Linda.  My name is Brenda.  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Hey Brenda.  Well, it's gonna go one or two days; either you're a smoker so you're all for it or you're a s- -- non [LAUGH] smoker like me and you totally hate it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, which one is it? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I have to tell you, I'm in --
L:  M- --
R:  Which, da- -- people say ex smokers are the worst [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm an ex smoker but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't -- I don't agree with banning -- I really don't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I guess I'm one of those, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ones that are contradictive to the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, scenario of an --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ex smoker.  Ah [LAUGH] -- ah, you said --
L:  So, does a- --
R:  You said that you're --
L:  O- --
R:  -- you're against --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're against the b- --
L:  Yeah.  I've never -- never smoked.  Did the old, you know, hiding out in the tree house, kinda, thing as a kid. [NOISE] I thought it was disgusting then [NOISE] and so I [NOISE] never did smoke.
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah, I totally hate it.  I think it should be blan- -- [NOISE] banned from the whole planet. [LAUGH]  You know?
R:  Yeah.  See, that's what I mean, I --
L:  I would just --
R:  -- I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think that people have a right to do what they wanna do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, I mean, that's just what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- makes us what we are but I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think that we should be, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- confined into one area with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- smokers if you are a non smoker because of the second hand smoke and all that stuff.
L:  Well, I guess, I -- I would be a little more l- -- you know, liberal to it if -- if it wasn't -- if it had any good in it, you know what I mean?
R:  Oh, yeah.  No, there's no good in smoking.
L:  I mean, there's all this cancer and -- yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's -- I --
L:  'Cause it's -- even the second hand smoke is bad so --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I mean, if it was just, like, you know, they want to have a hamburger and it was their prerogative [NOISE] but this is something that just has [NOISE] no [NOISE] purpose, you know?
R:  Yeah.  No, I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- happen to agree.  Like I said, I'm an ex smoker --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and I do agree that it is a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- disgusting, terrible habit and --
L:  [LAUGH] It's just really --
R:  -- you know, you could die.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, this is why I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- quit.  But don't get me wrong --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's, like, I always have that desire to smoke --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I don't because I -- I quit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, I just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know it's better for me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But as -- as far as the banning --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.  I don't think that they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think that anybody has a right to tell you you can't do something.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I -- I guess it's the same thing, like, ah, you know, if riding them -- not wearing your helmet when you're riding a motorcycle -- it's your own prerogative.  If you wanna be an idiot and slam you head against [LAUGH] the pavement [NOISE] l- --
R:  Exactly.  No, I totally --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I totally --
L:  They ha- --
R:  -- agree with you.  I think that if -- if somebody wants to smoke -- I mean, there used to be -- I mean, I'm sure you're -- y- you don't sound like you're a teenager --
L:  No, I'm almost [inaudible].
R:  You know, there -- there used to be, um, places -- you know, you have a smoking section and a non smoking section.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now, it's, like, everywhere is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no smoking. [NOISE] And I b- --
L:  Well, I -- I think that used to be because they didn't realize how harmful it was.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Right.
L:  And so, now that we've gotten smarter and more educated we know there's nothing good in it so what's the point of having it?
R:  Right.  But then --
L:  You know?
R:  -- then it's hard because then, of course, the people -- there are consumers that go out to eat that are smokers that if they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wanna sit in a smoking section filled with smoke killing themselves, they should be allowed to do that.
L:  Oh, that's -- that's the worst.  I hate that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like when you go to a restaurant, "Smoking or non smoking?"  And, of course, you ask for the non smoking and they're -- that's right against the bench of the smoking so it's, like, that's [several inaudible words].
R:  Well, yeah -- no, it shouldn't be right there.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I agree with you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There should be some, kinda, wall or something.
L:  You know, and you're trying to eat and you're g- -- you get -- you can still e- -- I can smell a cigarette when I'm sitting in -- in a stop light and I have my windows down and the guy in s- -- front of me has -- is smoking in his car.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I mean, so, you know, in a restaurant it's not gonna --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you're gonna have to just not even have it in the restaurant, which is, like, what they're trying to do -- totally ban it.  But --
R:  Well, they pretty much --
L:  But it's, ah --
R:  -- have been -- well, I -- what -- what state are you in?
L:  In Florida.
R:  Yeah, me too.  I'm in Florida --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I was gonna say, they pretty much banned it.
L:  Yeah, they have here haven't they?  Yeah.  They really gone --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, they did.
L:  -- crazy with --
R:  I mean, of course except for, like, those outdoor type of atmosphere ones --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that, like, it looks like you're outside at a bar type of thing.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm in South Florida so everything's on the, you know, little beaches and stuff that -- that go drive and all the [inaudible] so --
R:  Is it banned --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there?
L:  No.  I mean, like you say, inside the restaurants you --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- for the most part, yeah but outside when you're sitting on the little -- you know, wa- -- looking at the people w- walking by and stuff --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- the cabanas and stuff, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  And --
R:  -- that's where --
L:  Which is okay.  I mean, ah, that's better.  I still don't -- I -- you know, I'm -- still don't like it but the [inaudible] with alcohol.  I mean, I'm such a [LAUGH] -- I'm such a terrible person so --
R:  Yeah.  But they have to -- they have to be able to smoke somewhere.  They're not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, I like -- I -- I agree with the -- okay, you shouldn't smoke in the restaurant right next to a table that's not smoking and has a young child.  But I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you're going to a bar and you're smoker, because I --
L:  Yeah.  I can see how that would be --
R:  -- I am an ex smoker --
L:  That one's hard.
R:  -- how could you not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have a cigarette and you're --
L:  I- --
R:  -- sitting drinking?
L:  Yeah.
R:  As a smoker, you -- you -- that's what you do.  So, I mean, then the --
L:  Yes.  Going to a bar, drinking and smoking h- -- it probably goes together, you know, like --
R:  No, it does.  It d- -- I mean --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- I -- I do know that.  It -- it does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean, then they're taking away from the -- you know, from the places that are encouraging people to come in and drink --
L:  Yeah.  They're gonna have to just, ah, go to, like, smoking bars [LAUGH] and non smoking bars --
R:  There you should be a smoking bar.
L:  -- is what it's gonna come to.  Yeah.
R:  There really be should.  I mean, seriously.
L:  It is.
R:  There should be.
L:  'Cause even -- you know, I even b- -- you -- you know, in my twenties, y- you know, I used to go out and hang out at bars too and, of course, there was the smoke --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and whatever and I just dealt with it 'cause I was young, I didn't care.  But now, you know, I'm almost forty, if I went to a bar and I'm not a smoker --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- e- -- I wouldn't even enjoy myself --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if the place was just to- -- I mean, I can even remember then, the place totally fills with smoke but --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- you know, I would -- I would like to have a no smoking bar even and just -- you know, go listen to the -- the band on a weekend --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, have my little drink or whatever and y- -- or no drink or whatever, you know, my little nachos and stuff --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but not have to smell the smoke along with it.  So, it's -- yeah, it's getting to the point where you're gonna -- it's gonna have, like -- like, you know, like, the gentlemen clubs or whatever.  The s- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  The cigar clubs where now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're gonna have just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- regular [LAUGH] cigarette --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- clubs.
R:  M- -- I -- I [NOISE] --
L:  M- -- so [LAUGH] --
R:  I -- I totally agree with that because I do think that if they had a bar, like, that was for smokers and a bar that was for non smokers, I think that everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would be happy --
L:  Yeah.  Really.
R:  -- and that people would go where they want to without there being any problems with either end.  I --
L:  Course, this you have your friends that are smokers that can't go party with your non smoking friends so it's complicated.  Yeah.
R:  There you go.  Then there's another issue there.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think -- I think fifty years from now, I'd really be surprised if there's still c- cigarettes on the planet.  M- -- you know?  'Cause --
R:  Oh, no, they're not getting rid of them.
L:  I don't know.  I mean, the big -- 'cause that [several inaudible words] --
R:  I mean, the big companies, I mean, R.J. --
L:  Yeah.  I think it [inaudible] --
R:  -- Reynolds is trying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how horrible it is for you.  But, I mean, they -- they make billions and billions of dollars a year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They don't want you to stop smoking.
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and the pharmaceutical companies make big money off people having cancer too really so --
R:  Well, now, actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the- they have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- websites on the computer that tell you that, you know, smoking will kill you so they can't be sued.  They can't be sued anymore if you got cancer --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or anything due to smoking 'cause they -- they have it all on the internet.
L:  Openly admit it.  So, now, smok- --
R:  They're covering their butts.
L:  Smoking we don't -- yeah.
R:  They're covering their butts.
L:  Yeah.  But it's so ridiculous that s- -- they can get away with something like that, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're telling you, "By doing this you're gonna have this happen, this happen --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- this could happen".  But now, they can't be sued anymore.  They've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lost so much money to people suing for cancer and defects --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and this and that, that now they -- they can't be sued anymore because they put themselves written down on the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on the internet.
L:  So, now, they --
R:  Which they're smart.
L:  -- say, "Smoke at your own risk" or whatever, right?
R:  That's it.  Sma- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just, like -- yeah, just, like, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- drink at your own risk --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- drive at your own risk.  I mean, they -- they really are.  They're -- it's such a commercialized thing that, I mean, they don't even need to have advertising on a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on a television or anything telling people to smoke.  It's just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something that y- --
L:  Well, if you imagine the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the amount of money the medical industry makes because of it and -- you know, cancer, the emphysema and all the other hundreds of things because of --
R:  Yes.
L:  Jeeze.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a big -- yeah.  I can see --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- why it -- they can't just get rid of it, you know?
R:  No.  I mean, the --
L:  But it's funny, you know, like -- like, you know, I remember when I was a kid, you know, the red M and M's cause cancer so [NOISE] boom, within a day, you never saw [LAUGH] another red M and M's for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what was it?  Eleven years bef- --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- came out again?
R:  I remember that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  That's right.
L:  It was eleven years later they figured out how to make it without the cancerous stuff in it so then we have red M and M's again.  But --
R:  So, why don't they do that --
L:  -- they need to [LAUGH] --
R:  -- with cigarettes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's the problem?
L:  These cigarettes -- I mean, people die [LAUGH] left and right but they're still right there and it's not --
R:  Exactly.  I mean, they do the lo- --
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  -- the low tar, this and that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They all read the --
L:  The --
R:  -- same thing, they could all still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do the same exact thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, they're obviously --
L:  Just [inaudible].  Yeah.
R:  There's something in there that they just don't wanna take out for whatever reason it may be.
L:  Yeah.  Until the --
R:  But, no, I -- I --
L:  It's the part that addicts you to keep you g- -- to the smoking.  That's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- yeah.
R:  No.  Like I said, I haven't smoked in about four years.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  And I -- if I'm in an environment where there's people smoking, it's --
L:  That must be tough.  Yeah.
R:  -- it's ve- --
L:  M- -- yeah.
R:  -- it's, like, instantly, I wanna light up a cigarette.
L:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] stop smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  And I have to stop -- yeah.  I mean, I have to stop and say to myself, "Wait a minute, I -- I don't smoke anymore".  So, I do understand the both sides of it because it is, it's such an addictive thing and it's -- it's for addictive personalities because --
L:  Yeah.  'Cause someone in my family smokes too and I just never did so, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I seen it all around me but ...
R:  Well, no, you're very --
L:  M- --
R:  -- fortunate not to because then you --
L:  M- --
R:  -- don't have that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that inner desire --
L:  The urge --
R:  -- to do it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even though it is disgusting.  I totally --
L:  And my --
R:  -- agree.
L:  My husband has asthma so he never did so that's good. [LAUGH]
R:  My husband has asthma and he does --
L:  So --
R:  -- smoke.
L:  Oh, he does?  Doesn't [LAUGH] it kill him?
R:  My husband is just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My husband is a smoker --
L:  With asthma?  Well --
R:  Well, we both smoked.
L:  Hm.
R:  I quit and he didn't.  So, he's still a smoker and he has asthma.
L:  Well, then when you kiss him and it tastes like smoke, does- doesn't that make you wanna [LAUGH] have a cigarette?
R:  A- always.
L:  Do- -- [LAUGH]
R:  Always.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- an easy thing.  It really --
L:  Y- -- oh, yeah.
R:  -- isn't.  That -- that's why it -- it's -- it's a hard -- it -- smoking is a very hard topic, especially with me --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because I -- I'm on both ends of it and I know --
L:  But --
R:  -- if I -- if I would know that nobody would know and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I wouldn't affect my -- my child and I'd light up a cigarette and everything would be okay, I would do it because I'm that, kind of, personality.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But there's just too many things involved with smoking.  'Cause I remember the coughing at night, you know, the not being able to breathe -- I remember it.  So, that's what stops me from doing it so this whole issue with banning smoking, i- it's -- it -- you can't do it.  You -- I mean, they will do it but they can't do it completely.  It's like they're not gonna stop the market --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- for smok- -- for s- -- for --
L:  The --
R:  -- selling cigarettes.
L:  They'll have -- they'll have, like, the old speakeasies in the day of prohibition.  People will be sneaking around doing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- illegal smoking [LAUGH] for your --
R:  "Hey, you got a pack of cigarettes?"
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, for --
R:  "I'll buy 'em from you".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Fifty bucks? Give me a b- --"
L:  Be a hard player. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No, it's --
L:  That's what a --
R:  It -- it is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It is the truth.
L:  Guys in the back alley selling cigarettes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I could see that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I really can.
L:  It -- yeah.  Like, [several inaudible words]
R:  Because they're not gonna stop.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's too much --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's too many people in this world that are smoking.  I mean, they're doing really good things with advertising now with, you know -- with the kids, like, "Don't smoke" and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- showing these commercials with how much money they're making and pro- --
