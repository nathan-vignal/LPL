L:  Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm a nineteen year old college student, just kind of hanging out this summer.  I have a part time job.  Nothing too complicated [LAUGH].
R:  Hi, I'm Amy.  I'm a twenty two year old um part time receptionist.
L:  Mm.  Where do you live?
R:  Um, California.
L:  Oh, I'm over in Michigan [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you're pretty far away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  This topic.  Well, the first question they asked, they asked something like, "How does it ..." like, "Did it change me?" or "Does it affect me?" the divorce rates.
R:  Hm.
L:  Was that the first question?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Well, personally, I don't think it has affected me very much.  My parents are still together, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't really feel the thing and I don't -- I have friends whose parents are separated, but it seems that in their situations it was probably for the best, but I don't know, have you been affected by the, you know, increase in divorce rates?
R:  Um, no because I'm -- I'm basically like you, my parents are still together and I'm not married and so it really hasn't affected me at all, no.
L:  Yeah.  Um, do you think that it's like good that people are getting divorced, do you think it's just like an openness with themselves and admitting that maybe they're not the right ones for each other and that they should move on, or do you think that maybe people should try to work through problems and, you know, stay committed like they did, you know, the -- like they promised in their marriage vows?
R:  Yeah, I think people should work on it and try to stay together because I -- I actually feel that that's something that they should, you know, um, be able to know the other person before they even make the commitment to get married.
L:  Yeah, that is true.  I know a lot of people like, you know, they go through one big problem in marriage and, you know, they think that it's all over --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I think that really stinks because then -- I think people should learn about each other's limits before they get married also, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Mm.
L:  And I think a lot of people now get married, I don't know, maybe they're not ready when they get married.  My boyfriend and I fight all the time, like we get into these nasty arguments --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, you know, at first I thought, "Oh, man.  This is horrible.  We're not right for each other" but after a while you kind of like, I don't know, you learn about each other and it's really nothing anymore.
R:  Yeah --
L:  And I don't know --
R:  -- and it's -- it's good to go through that stuff before you get married, that way, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you won't end up in divorce.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Like when I was younger --
R:  Learn --
L:  -- I used to think that, you know, the best kind of relationship was one that you didn't like, I don't know, it was perfectly smooth and nice and everything like that, but, you know, you do go through rough times and, you know, those things are probably definitely going to happen and you learn -- I think you have to learn how to deal with it before you get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like heavily involved, but that's just my take [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It's good to go through it, like I said, before you get married because at least you can have everything open and you know the person, you know, that problems that you can work through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before you get married.  Yeah.
L:  Are you like involved with anyone?
R:  Um, no, I'm actually single.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  See, this is like my -- probably my third, I guess, really serious relationship, but this is probably, I don't know, we've been together for almost two and a half years, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's -- it's really cool.  Yay.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever been like in a relationship before?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I -- I don't know, I just like to -- I like to remain single.  I don't know.
L:  Oh, that's fine.  Sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I wish I were single again [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, but it's, um, the divorce rates are going up a lot and that's just for people I guess being inexperienced and -- and just jumping --
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  -- into marriage.
L:  -- I really don't know.  I think I -- a lot of people, especially women, are kind of like over indulging themselves and, "I'm a woman and I have the right to choose now, unlike before" --
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know.  Maybe they're kind of taking that approach instead of thinking, "We can get through it because I made a promise" and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I don't know.  And I -- I know that there's a share of people that really can't, you know, handle the relationship and it's probably best if they did get a divorce, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and to my -- you know, I'm under the impression that it's a lot of young people who are getting the divorces, but I'm not sure.
R:  Yeah.  I think so too.  Yeah.  A lot of young people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH] That kind of stinks, because I think a lot of those people aren't ready.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  What was some of the --
R:  And then they --
L:  What?
R:  I'm sorry, they just jump into it and then just think that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Well, we've been together this long, we should be married" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so --
L:  I think my little sister might be getting into that, but I don't know.  It's her first love, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she's going like headfirst into it.
R:  How old is she?
L:  Ah, she's sixteen, I think.
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, she's pretty young and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's kinda scary.  But the guy that she's dating, see my boyfriend, whatever you want to call him, he's -- he's pretty well to do, like he's getting a -- he's double majoring in math and physics and stuff and he's a nice kid, but he's really quiet and he kinda, you know, my f- my grandparents really don't like him because they say, "He never talks, he's --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- you know, he's so secretive and stuff" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But my sister's boyfriend is just like, you know, he's really nice in front of my grandparents so they love him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, you know, he's in this band and he does all this freaky stuff like claws himself and drugs and all this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, kind of low stuff, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that's really -- and my sister, I don't know why she likes this guy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I guess you can't help it when you fall in love.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's -- it's kinda scary because I don't know what's -- what he's going to be like when he gets older.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Is he older -- a lot older than her?
L:  Oh no, he's -- he's a year younger than me, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- well, he's either seventeen or eighteen.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  He's a year younger than her -- er, older than her.
R:  Hm.
L:  But I don't know.
R:  Hm.
L:  She's never had a boyfriend before, but she -- he's had like a few girlfriends that he was pretty serious with, so I don't know.
R:  Mm.
L:  In a relationship, like do you prefer to have someone with the same level of experience as you with relationships, or someone, you know, maybe who's much more experienced, who could take care of you?
R:  Um, yeah, I would say I think so, yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I always say that I would like to have somebody that's a male version of myself, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess, yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  But -- that's cool.  Oh, I found my sister's driver's license.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was just sitting on the table.  But, yeah, I couldn't handle someone who was like much older than me, or had much more experience than me, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know.  I would like it to be w- both on the same ground, kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  But ... hm.
R:  Is your sister talking about marriage, or is she just ...?
L:  I think she kinda hints at it.
R:  Mm.
L:  There's this thing that my grandma bought her that she hangs in her room.  It's this little like craft that has ribbon, it says, "Men with pierced ears are better suited for marriage.  They've experienced pain and bought jewelry".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's just a little thing that hangs on her wall, but Molly has this like apparently he bought her a little ring and, you know, she talks about hee hee hee, "We're gonna be together forever" and blah, blah, blah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  With my first love it was kinda, you know, it was kinda serious, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with your first love you always -- the emotions are just overwhelming, but I don't know, it wasn't like that.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Where we knew we wanted to get married and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] How is it, being twenty two and like, do you have a lot of friends who have gotten married or --
R:  Um --
L:  -- are most of them kind of waiting?
R:  I think a lot of my -- yeah, a lot of my friends are like me, I don't really have any friends that are my exact age that are married --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but um it's pretty cool, you know, it's nice [LAUGH] to be twenty --
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And do they think like -- are they aware of the divorce rates and is that kind of affecting their ah decision to wait to get married?
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  Because I think it's definitely affected me.  Because I -- I want to make sure that I don't get divorced.
R:  Yeah.  I think a lot of people now are like more scared of that, too, like a lot of younger people, even though they still get married, they are um afraid of the fact that their d- their marriage will end like in a failure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is like divorce, so I don't know.  They -- a lot of young people don't want to get married, but then you still have a lot of -- a big majority of 'em who are just ready to rush into marriage.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  But I know with me like I prefer just one person my whole life that I commit myself to and I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of people who, you know, want to go around a little bit before they settle down, but mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd like number one, just one person, my entire life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm really, really attracted by that idea.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And luckily, so is my ah significant other.
R:  Mm.
L:  It feels weird calling him a boyfriend, because I've known him for like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- since I was in second grade, so [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But that's good, it I mean, it -- sometimes it works out for the better with someone that you've known for a long time and that's the only person, you guys have both been together for a long time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and marriage is probably going to be more successful that way.
L:  Yeah, I -- I really hope so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we're kind of open at this time, like because we're so young --
R:  Yeah, you guys are young.
L:  -- I mean he's -- we're both nineteen and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I mean things change, well, you might get older and I don't know, we're planning to go and live together with his grandmother in Massachusetts --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, that's like, I guess, one step, you know, one big step in our relationship, living together, so we'll see how that goes, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Have you ever lived with like anyone else besides your family?
R:  Um, no.  No, I ah -- no.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, neither have I, really, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it should be interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a --
L:  But I do live with my grandparents, which I guess I could count, but --
R:  Mhm.  That's a big change, to live with -- well, that's -- that's how you can find out about another -- the other person too, you know, is how --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well you can live with them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Be able to get along with them.
L:  But, it will be very nice to get out of the house.
R:  Yeah.
