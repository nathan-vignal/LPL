R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello. [NOISE]
L:  I'm Marty.
R:  Hello.  Hi.  How are you? 
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, the topic is, um, how we react when there's a act of terrorism.
L:  Uh, terrorist attack, wasn't it?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Something, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think we would be panic.  Right?
L:  [LAUGH] I know I would. [LAUGH]
R:  There's no way then we will be calm.  Maybe -- maybe we have to be calm so that we can think clearly what we should do best and everything.  But naturally it will be panic everywhere, right?
L:  I think so.  I think for the majority.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know that I would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It depends on the type of the attack too, I guess.  You know, I mean, if it was some kind of gaseous cloud I mean [NOISE] --
R:  Okay, so --
L:  I don't know.  It'd probably not be as bad as a bombing or something of that nature.
R:  But for gas you will be like fainted, right?  Or, die. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Right away.
L:  Yeah, I guess so. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you don't have time to be panic.
L:  Yeah, that -- maybe that's the key.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't --
R:  Just a sudden death. [LAUGH]
L:  It's really hard to -- hard to imagine what you'd really do.  You know, you'd like to think what you would do but [NOISE] not what you'd probably do, right?
R:  Yeah. Uh-huh. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, have you -- when the, um -- do you have any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- experience, um, like those related to like, um, terrorism attack or something like that?
L:  Like in the what?
R:  Like, uh, I don't know.  Maybe not really terrorism but something really bad happened to you?
L:  Uh, yeah, kinda.  You know, I been in -- in, uh, panicky situations.  Uh, you know, maybe some [NOISE] woods type fires. [NOISE] I know, uh, with me one time I was in, uh, when I was in the Navy I had [NOISE] a, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We had, you know, fire --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fighting school [NOISE] and the -- my breathing device quit working and the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- instructor just reached over and unplugged it, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So that I was breathing the air -- the smoke and stuff that was in the room --
R: Uh-huh.
L:  [COUGH] That was kind of panicky for a moment but, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] Actually it, you know, maybe -- maybe in [NOISE] -- in some of those cases you just realize what you gotta do and just do it anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  How about --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you?  Any -- any experiences with the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- car wrecks --
R:  Um --
L:  -- or anything crazy?
R:  Um, nothing really. [NOISE] Thank god.
L:  Yeah.  No kidding?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so, um, but I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I kinda being prepared now if something happens like terrorist --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, attack or something because   Well, you see a lot of articles -- you read a lot of articles about what you should do when something like that happen, right? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you're more prepared now than maybe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like ten years ago.
L:  Yeah, just right out of the blue type of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause you're actually ex- -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We're all kind of on the edge half way expecting something now, aren't we?
R:  Uh-huh.  And also when you're going [NOISE] somewhere new some- sometimes I kinda check where are the like exits, fire exit, or emergency --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- exits.  Like checking, uh, where I should go when something happens because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- yeah, I feel es- +especially when it's like a public space where a lot of people and you don't know.  Maybe the terrorists will attack this.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, we don't know, right? [LAUGH] 
L:  No, you never know what they're gonna do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If, you know, if there is gonna be 'cause --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't, you know, I can -- almost another thing about it is that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm thinking to myself, you know, "We're really --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, when they had us worried that there was gonna be a lot of terrorist attacks after that -- after September eleventh a couple of years ago, you know.
R:  Uh-huh, Uh-huh.
L:  And then now I haven't seen anything --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- new.  Have you?
R:  [NOISE] Um, no.  I hope not but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we have to be prepared because --
L:  Right.
R:  They are still there. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Right?  We don't know.  And sometimes when things the least -- or like -- or like when we are -- we are not really expecting anything like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It seems like everything's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- calm.  Everything is okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then "Boom", something happens.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  Uh, maybe that's what they're waiting for us to -- to drop our guard, huh? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So when we are very alert like there are a lot of article on the paper I think, "Okay, that's okay". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And right now is a lot of, uh, police and like the guards everywhere.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I don't know.  It's sort of good but sort of, "Okay, this is not a safe place feeling".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
L:  Yeah, it's not   I don't know.  Um, I think that, uh, [LIPSMACK] as far as the way that -- the way that we react in it compared to, uh, the way we know now [NOISE] to expect that sort of thing.  And you said you looked  at the fire exits and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [COUGH] Kind of plan --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a way out. [COUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, if you consider that, you know, an awful lot of those people in the World Trade Center --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- situation kept their cool, clam.  You know, they -- I mean, a lot of 'em panicked but then there were also a lot of hero type people that -- that managed to realize, "Okay, this is a -- this is not a time to lose your cool".  So I guess we'd all -- probably a fifty fifty thing.  Probably just a [NOISE] -- a wild [NOISE] roll of the cards --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as to how we would react really. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  As individuals. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] But, uh, [NOISE] yeah, I think the fact [NOISE] that they [NOISE] -- they haven't [NOISE] -- haven't done anything [NOISE] kind of to me makes -- makes [NOISE] me think that they've kinda lost [NOISE] their interest but then [NOISE] who knows? [NOISE]
R:  Well, you never know.
L:  [NOISE] Where -- where do you --
R:  Don't say they lose interest.  I don't think so.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, where do you live at?  Do you live in a --
R:  New York.
L:  -- large city, or [NOISE] --
R:  New York.  Where do you live?
L:  New York? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] Well, see I live in Oklahoma where [NOISE] we don't really --
R:  Oklahoma -- oh, ooh, oh, there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was a [NOISE] -- this bombing --
L:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- a while ago, right?
L:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE] Had that --
R:  But they got him, right? 
L:  Huh?
R:  [NOISE] They got the, uh --
L:  Y- y- yeah, they con- -- you know, that's -- you know, I guess it just shows you, you know, even in the [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Even way back here in the boons- --
R:  Oklahoma, is it, uh, tornado?  A lot of tornado over there?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah, we have tornados [NOISE] all the time here. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, so it's not a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's natural terrorism. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we don't even -- we don't even consider those a -- a major deal hardly here.  You know, I mean, you know, you -- you won- [NOISE] -- you watch the news and you see that okay, there's a bunch of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- bunch of tornados happening and you kind of keep an eye out for it but [SIGH] what do you do?  You know.  You can't really [NOISE]   You can't run and hide very well.  If it's --
R:  Well --
L:  -- coming right at you -- you try to [NOISE] find some safe place but that's about it. [NOISE]
R:  So, every place -- every house has like a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- safe basement --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something like that?
L:  Uh, [NOISE] no.  Huh-uh.  Not really.
R:  Not really?
L:  No we don't --
R:  How come? [NOISE]
L:  -- have one.
R:  So, what happens if [NOISE] the -- your like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Your house got 
L:  [NOISE] Well, the trick is like you -- you know, you're supposed to go to a -- to like, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like in our case we go to -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We'd -- we have had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- situation where there was -- we thought there was a tornado, you know --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- heading right our -- our way and what we did --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- was we went to our utility room and [NOISE] -- and, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  Which is the fartherest [NOISE] away from the direction that [NOISE] tornados come from.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, because it is very predictable, right?  Because --
L:  Yeah, you know what direction they're gonna come from.
R:  -- you know when it's coming.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know that and you --
R:  Mhm.  So, you can be --
L:  You're watching the weather a lot of times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Of course the one time we actually did think we had one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The [NOISE] -- it was first thing in the morning and nobody had been on [NOISE] as -- was watching TV --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so therefore [COUGH], you know, it was kinda like we just heard the -- heard a roar type --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- sound and I got up and woke e- -- I got everybody woke up and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We ran in here and it turned out it, you know, it -- it was pretty close to a tornado [NOISE] because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we had hail stones about the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- size of basketballs --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  So, is it like the movie Twister, or something?
L:  Sometimes they are.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you have the alarm that wakes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everybody, right?
L:  Right.  Yeah, when --
R:  So --
L:  -- it's a   Thing is though is that [LIPSMACK], you know, here in Oklahoma where I live --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, you know, you're kind of, uh, [NOISE] you know, you -- you may be near town but [NOISE] as far as it goes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, maybe you're still like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- three or four miles away from the nearest siren.
R:  Ah.
L:  Which means that you can hear it fine on a clear day [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if you got rain pounding down and the [NOISE] wind howling pretty loud and stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Sometimes you don't hear it anyway. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Ah.
L:  When you sort of hear it then you get a little -- you go, "Uh-oh, oh my god, that's the --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's the tornado siren".  You know.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So that really gets you moving but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's kind of a crazy deal but --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  We don't even -- like that -- that is kind of like terrorism though.  It's kind of a natural form of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- terrorism. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  So, but okay I don't think I'm going to Oklahoma. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It's not scary when you see it in the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, in the movie and the oh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- news.  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  But they like to make the movies.  They gotta make the movies.  You know, and you gotta keep in mind that movie Twister --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Those people were actually chasing down the storms, you know.
R:  Yes.  Some people are -- I don't know what's in their minds. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's kind of neat though because they had, you know, they had the ability to -- to track 'em and they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- knew right where they were so --
R:  Yeah, and they have the guts.
L:  You know, that's be- -- [LIPSMACK] better than sitting in your house hoping that it doesn't hit you, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know. [NOISE] It's crazy.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But --
R:  Okay, so back to the terrorism --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, what, um, the topic was   What is it?  Um, what we should do not to be panicked, right?
L:  [NOISE] How we -- how would we react I think and --
R:  H- --
L:  -- what else?
R:  How would we react?  Of course trying to be safe.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Trying to be -- I don't know.  Yeah, when something happens of course you -- is for me I think I will try to save myself first not anybody else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  No kidding.
R:  Not like the fire fighter --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trying to save -- rescue the people.  Oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Not me.  Not me. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  You just wanna get out of the way.  Let somebody[?] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- save theirselves, right?
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  That's good.  I -- that's not a bad thing either, you know.  I don't think I would try to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not unless I was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like you said, you know, the fire fighters they know what to do.
