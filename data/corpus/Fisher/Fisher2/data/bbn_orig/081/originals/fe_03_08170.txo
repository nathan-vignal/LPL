R:  Hey, where'd the tone go? [LAUGH] Did you hear the tone?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Did you hear the tone?  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Just barely.  Can you hear me?
R:  Just barely [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, golly.  I couldn't even hear what they said the topic was, it was so low.
R:  The topic, um, was basically marriage in the United States and if the status of the divorce rate has influenced um your views on marriage.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] I just barely could hear a little bit on there, I don't know whether it's on this end or what it is but and I -- you're way far away [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I actually possibly could be, but [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it could be that too [LAUGH].  Um --
R:  Well, honestly, I don't think that um it has influenced my decision about marriage or, you know, my concept of being married just for the fact ah every situation of marriage is different.  And that I'm not going to go round and live my life according to the status of the world because [SIGH] huh, the world's in a mess already [LAUGH].
L:  Boy, you say that again [LAUGH].
R:  Don't n- doesn't need my help or influence.
L:  Boy, it doesn't mine either.  That's for sure.  I have to agree with you.  I'm not going to let that be an influence on [MN] my opinions as far as the um marriage is considered.  I think that's something that each individual has to choose and decide and um as far as government and state and things and -- and opinions, ah I -- that doesn't influence my view one way or the other.
R:  No, it doesn't.  I mean, everybody has to think for themselves and if they honestly don't, then I think we're in a bigger mess than I think we already are.
L:  That is for sure.  That is a certainty.  Ah, we've just, ah, I don't know, it's just so much out there that so many people who don't stop and think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, about what --
R:  It all consists of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Before they go jumping both feet in.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do.  They don't give it a full consideration before they do it and --
R:  They just think, "Oh, we well we get along great and" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some even to the point of, our intimate life's great, we know we can live off that and it's like, "No you can't" [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no.  Huh uh, don't work that away.  It takes a lot of perseverance and a lot of --
R:  Patience.
L:  -- sticking things out that -- that you don't really want to stick out [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  In order to make it work.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Oh.  And it's ah -- it's not a fifty fifty, it's a ninety ten on both ends [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I know.  And it seems like you're always giving and the other person's like, they're always giving and it's -- it's a never ending cycle, but you have to do that, otherwise it doesn't last.
L:  That's correct.  That's correct.
R:  And if it doesn't last, what's the point of h -- you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, if you couldn't have seen that beforehand, that it wasn't going to, what makes you think well, except for a lot of them don't think [LAUGH].
L:  That's it.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's like you said, they jump into it, think, "Oh well, you know" and then, "It's easy to get a v- divorce nowadays so, you know, we -- we get into this, we don't like it, well, you know, we'll just go" --
R:  It's so common.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's not anything that's um, they don't think about God giving them this um opportunity to be together and everything and then they just think, "Well, we'll just throw it out the window" and --
R:  Yeah.  They -- they don't cherish it.
L:  No.  No.  It's not -- it's not a cherished --
R:  I don't know if it's just the way they're being brought up because their parents are always in a bad relationship because the mom doesn't know what she's looking for because she was so young and you know, you could go around the whole story, shebang of why mama's doing all the things she's doing and now that she's influenced her kids to the same concept and it's like, you know, when are these parents going to step back and say, "Hey, look, you know, I'm supposed to be the role model for these guys and I'm being just a big a jerk and --" 
L:  Yeah.  Right.  I'm not --
R:  "-- statistic is everybody else is"
L:  [MN] They're not really being a parental role, um --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, they're -- that's -- that's the one bad thing about it.  I think that with ah the younger people and the younger generation and how they're getting married, ah and then you -- you take them thinking about what they're -- well, they -- they get into it when they're younger, they see that, well, the next generation jumps into it, they don't even stop and think, you know, the consequences that comes about. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] No, I mean, I mean people try to give these kids some good examples, but I mean they examples they have are mom and dad and Hollywood nowadays.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  And Hollywood gets it just because, like, the Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they were married almost ten years and by common law, you know, now they actually have to share everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so they got a divorce.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's like, they were happy.  What's wrong?
L:  What happened to it?  Yes.  What happened to that um love that -- that was supposed to be there and was so deep for that many years?  I ah -- w- heard a discussion today on ah TV and they were ah -- a couple were talking about ah this was his second marriage and her first and they were talking about they knew each -- each person, they'd only known each other for two weeks and decided that they were going to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um get married and now they're wondering why there's problems and troubles, you know and I thought, "Two weeks.  That's not enough time to even go out and discover anything, you know, before you decide to spend a lifetime commitment with somebody" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and um --
R:  I mean because I can honestly vouch for myself, my husband and I, we m- about -- knew each other about as long as we dated, and it wasn't for very long.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And our first years of marriage was just like, I'm honestly surprised we didn't end up getting divorced.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But we decided this was something that we wanted and we both ended up working very hard and feeling like, you know, to some degree losing each other as to who we were so that we could gain each other --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's something that they don't understand nowadays.
L:  No, they don't.  They --
R:  Is you've got to lose yourself, you know, to gain that other person.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  You do, you have to grow through the relationship in order for it to work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's no amount of government, state, organizations or anything that can teach you that --
R:  No.
L:  -- you've just got to be willing to get in there and persevere and work.  [NOISE] And um unfortunately it's like it's just like though with everything else it's too easy to get out of anything that there is --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, financial burdens or anything like that, if -- if they don't -- you know, if you don't like it, hey, well, go to the courts and get the um -- um bankruptcy or --
R:  Hey, I don't like you, let's get a divorce [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's like [NOISE] like, what's -- what's [LAUGH] so, I don't know --
R:  And the --
L:  -- it's ah -- it's a difficult --
R:  And the judge asking, "Well, what's the reasoning?", "+Irreconcilable differences" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's -- and it's like, what does that mean?
L:  What is that?  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, I mean, no one's going to get along.  You've got to ah [PAUSE] --
R:  I mean, heck, at that rate, could I divorce my par- well, I can do that now days, but [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you can [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  When I was younger, heck, I didn't get along with my parents.
L:  Well, nobody does.  Nobody.  I mean, they're always going to be your parents and you -- when you get older you start realizing.  When you're the parent, you know what they've gone through too.  But [NOISE] but you don't get [SIGH] I mean, you know, you d- when you're young, oh, no way.  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah, it's like they are the worst parents in the world.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They don't understand anything [LAUGH].
R:  And to some degree so p- so many parents are out of the loop with what their children do because they're so involved in the status of the world, they've got to keep up that quo[?] nobody can be lower middle class or upper lower class or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you -- you have -- even lower class, just to be with the family instead of at the job place.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Because then they're fulfilling that job status.
L:  Yes, sure is.
R:  And then it turns around to being a divorce status.
L:  And then, there you go [LAUGH].
R:  And then it just cy- the cycle begins all over again.
L:  It certainly does.  And like we said, when the parents doesn't have a role model for the children, then there's not anything that they have to look back towards and -- and try to work towards, you know.
R:  Yeah, there's no --
L:  I'm not just blaming the parents, I mean, you know, there's -- there's --
R:  There's no positive role model in their life.
L:  No.  Huh uh.  No.  But it could be, you know, even back through grandparents and things, the generations ago grandparents wouldn't have even -- well, they had no idea what a divorce was [LAUGH] you know, I mean, you got in there and you stuck with it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But um --
R:  Well, I knew what a divorce was because my parents, they got one right after ah when I was still a young little girl --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and ah so I knew what it was.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And my friends were like, "Your parents are divorced, what's that mean?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it's like, you gotta constantly tell them and then all of a sudden you get older and "Hey, your parents are divorced?"  "Yes" "So are mine" and it just became a common --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- denominator between everybody and it's like, "Yeah, well my dad's had three wives now, how many's your got?  How many's yours?"
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And it's almost like a compe- competition, you know what I mean.
L:  Yeah.  That's your way -- that was a conversation.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this, I mean, well, I'm going to this mother's this weekend and that dad's next weekend and I'm going here and I'm going to do that and -- and so forth --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
R:  And grandma's got me in between all of that because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah, grandma's got me most of the time [LAUGH].
R:  That's because mom and dad [several inaudible words] they want me, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, right.  Right.
R:  And -- and you look at them and you go, "I wonder why you're so messed up" I mean, who's the constant role model?  Grandma and grandpa, which -- no offence --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to grandma and grandpa because I love mine.
L:  Oh, yes.  Oh definitely.
R:  But they -- they're raising is done.
