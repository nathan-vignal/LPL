L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Diane.
R:  Oh, I'm Tammy. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.  Are --
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Oh, pretty good.  It's [SIGH] warm weather today so I'm having a nice day. [LAUGH]
L:  W- what are -- where are you?
R:  Wisconsin.
L:  I'm in Louisiana.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm in up- w- -- Upper Wisconsin and we've had it in the high eighties the last few days.
L:  Oh, we're pretty hot over here too.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess we need to talk about smoking though, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  U- um, well, how do you feel about, ah, sm- --
R:  Um --
L:  -- banning it in public places?
R:  I am, kinda, for it because nobody in my family smokes so when we go, like, into a restaurant or something I sure wouldn't wanna breathe it while I was eating.
L:  Right.  You see, I -- I -- I do smoke but I don't -- I feel that banning it is fine.  I don't -- I don't -- I'm the type of person I don't like to smoke around people that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, especially people that don't smoke.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, I mean, 'cause I understand.  I know -- you know, to bother somebody, especially if they're eating.  So, I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- think it's fine if they would ban it in all public places.  That -- that really wouldn't even concern me.
R:  I -- I, kinda -- I thought it was surprising to see that, like, in New York they banned it from bars and that's where you expect people to be smoking when they're drinking.  So, I'm not sure I'm -- not that I -- I smoke so it doesn't really affect me but for other people, I'm -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that -- that's a little -- I didn't know they did that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a -- it's a law now.  Um, my dad smokes so when he came up to visit us and he -- we went to a restaurant and there was no smoking and he had a fit and it was really embarrassing.
L:  Right.
R:  And he's, like, "I'm not ever coming back here again" and I'm sure they probably didn't want him back. [LAUGH] But, you know --
L:  Well, I find that the older generation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are more -- 'cause my father in law, he's like that.  He will light a cigarette -- you know, he would light a cigarette, if he could, in church. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I mean, 'cause it's just -- it's such a --
R:  It --
L:  -- habit for him.
R:  Yep.
L:  And -- and they -- they were saying we needed to talk about the -- the -- the ads, you know, like, with the cancer and all and that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that does -- I think they need to keep doing that, especially, like, with myself 'cause I know I need to quit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and when I see that it does make me aware y- you know --
R:  I, um -- I like --
L:  -- that it is bad.
R:  Yeah.  I like seeing the ones, um -- when -- like, when my kids are watching TV with me and the kids come on saying, "Oh, yeah, the cigarette companies are trying to get us to smoke but we're not gonna fall for it" you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And that sorta thing.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I used to smoke but I only smoked, um, like, socially and I didn't have to have my cigarettes and when I quit, I quit really easily.
L:  Well, that's good.  That's --
R:  So --
L:  That's really [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that was nothing, you know, to me but I know there are people like my dad -- oh, he was up to three packs a day and I just -- uk.
L:  Right.  Well, you see the ads I think are good for the fact that I did start smoking when I was a teenager --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- because I thought it was, you know --
R:  Cool?
L:  -- cool and -- and my friends were doing it.  And the deal how, you know, you can't buy cigarettes -- I think you have to be eighteen?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if that would've been like that when I was, you know, fifteen, sixteen, lighting cigarettes, then it would've been a little bit harder.  I probably --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  I g- -- I would -- I wish I wouldn't have never picked up that first [LAUGH] cigarette [LAUGH] and did it. [LAUGH]
R:  It is really -- it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Just -- your clothes smell and everything.
L:  Right.  Right.  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And -- and it's hard 'cause, like, my little girl, she'll see the ads --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she'll tell me [NOISE] 'cause, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she's aware and she knows from me smoking, by seeing this, you know, "Mama, that's bad.  You shouldn't do that" and --
R:  Yeah and it makes you feel bad? [LAUGH]
L:  It does.  It does.  But I mean, it is good that they're doing that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, hopefully, the -- the younger ones won't -- you know, they won't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smoke.
R:  Y- -- right.  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  I know.  I find it hard to believe that anybody i- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- i- in this day and age would actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- start smoking that never smoked before because there's so much --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, th- there's so much information out there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of how it's bad for your heal- -- and they're up to, like, three fifty a pack around here.  I don't know how much they are by you but who can afford it?
L:  Right.  That's a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's about it.  Th- -- about three fifty, four dollars usually.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.
L:  It -- it's [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, if you smoked a pack a day, anybody -- oh, ha- -- how could -- oh, I just can't understand. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I can barely keep --
L:  I --
R:  -- milk in the fridge sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Right.  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  But, yeah, they've been -- ever s- -- I -- ever since I've had my kids in school -- and the oldest one is sixteen -- I can remember it always [NOISE] ...  In fact, one time they had a thing when they were saying that, um, smoking was, like, a -- doing drugs and one of my kids came home and said, "Mom, you're doing drugs" and this is a long time --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ago and I -- I was, kind of, offended at that because it wasn't like it was illegal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But still, I -- I guess they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting the word out so ...
L:  Right.  Well, it -- i- it's --
R:  Ah ...
L:  -- good that they do do that.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] I would hate to say any -- and I was, ah -- I was the only one out of four kids that smoked and my mom didn't smoke but my dad did.  So, I guess ... I don't know what the reasoning is there.  But like I said, I didn't even stick with it. [NOISE]
L:  Well, that -- right.  I mean, it was not --
R:  So --
L:  -- like you say you did socially.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] But I -- I don't -- I don't -- I know people angry that y- you know, like, my father in law, these heavy smokers that when they go into places they wanna be able to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- light their cigarette and n- --
R:  As soon as they get done eating it's, like, "Oh, time for a cigarette".
L:  Mhm.  And you see, we ha- -- I don't know -- do you have casinos --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- where you're at?
R:  Yeah.
L:  In the casino, I mean, as soon as you walk in it's just a big smoke cloud.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And they had some, ah -- the workers at the casino here, they were -- I think they sued the -- the, um -- it's a boat -- The Treasure Chest it's called, I think they were suing some of the workers because they had to work around so much smoke.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I just, kinda, look at it as you shouldn't have took the job.  You know --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- what the environment you're going in.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I mean, n- -- there's no w- -- people gamble, they smoke.
R:  [NOISE] And -- yeah.
L:  And it's just like if they drink, they smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  That'd be like an alcoholic taking a drink there because people are drinking too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, at least up here anyway they sell drinks and stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, they give it to you, ah, here.
R:  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  You know, if you sit down at a machine, here they come --
R:  Yup. [LAUGH]
L:  -- offering you drinks. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The more money the merrier.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I guess I -- I guess I would say I'm for all the anti smoking ads and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.  And I'm for it too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and especially me being a sm- -- a smoker and I am for it, you know, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think it would be for the best --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to keep it out of all the public places --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially knowing how bad it is.
R:  Right. [NOISE] Right.
L:  How long have you been doing this?  The -- the calls?
R:  Um, oh, I think since, like, last fall and you're actually my -- the third [NOISE] person I've talked to.  I- --
L:  Yeah.  Th- -- you're my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- second person and I guess I started about a month ago.
R:  Oh. [NOISE] And how many times have you done it?
L:  Ah, you -- you're number two.
R:  Oh.  Um, it seems like they call on Sundays, which I probably told them too, but lately, we haven't been home so I always hear a message that they called.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, I've been missing them, like, the last three or four weeks.
L:  I've been -- they've been calling me on Fridays ha- --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I've been missing them.
R:  Well, I keep hoping, "Well, I hope they'll call back because --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- you know ..."  But --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I d- -- I don't know how long you have to do it to get paid.  I haven't gotten paid yet but maybe --
L:  No, I h- -- I haven't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- either.  I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.
R:  But its, kinda, fun, ah, talking to somebody in a different state.  You never know who it's gonna be. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Oh. [NOISE] So, anyway, did you -- I think I stated my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, what was I gonna say?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, going into the gas station -- I'll just run into the gas station here and -- like, for a gallon of milk and the whole [NOISE] thing will [NOISE] be, like, a big cloud because [NOISE] the cashier stands back there and smokes for his whole shift, you know?
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  And it's just disgusting because I'll -- you know, I'll [NOISE] go in and buy my milk, come out and sit in my car and I can just smell it on me just from being in there for less than five minutes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that should --
L:  A- --
R:  I think that should be illegal but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.  Well, people shouldn't be allowed to smoke when they're working a- --
R:  And not only that but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they sell, like, um, fresh bakery and stuff [NOISE] you got -- that stuff [NOISE] just sits there --
L:  Right, in this [LAUGH] --
R:  -- and it stinks. [LAUGH]
L:  You don't wanna buy it, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Not that I need it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  I have the same problem.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That was one of the reason I [NOISE] thought it would be cool to smoke when I was young was [NOISE] 'cause then I wouldn't eat so much.  Oh, like I really needed to lose weight then. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But when you quit smoking then you just wanna eat more.
R:  Yup.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So -- I don't know.  The doctor --
L:  'Cause it --
R:  The doctor always says it's better to be a little bit overweight than to be a smoker so I always take comfort in that. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But anyway, I would just hate to see any of my kids smoking.
L:  Right.  I feel the same way.  And, like I said --
R:  Once they grow up, I mean. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If they did it now I'd crack 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How many kids you have?
R:  Um, four t- -- four of 'em and they're from sixteen to two so --
L:  Oh, my goodness.  You got a --
R:  Yeah.  The last -- the last two were little surprises so ...
L:  [LAUGH] I have --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- one and she's five.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  She's five?
L:  Five.  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I had just one.
R:  Oh.
L:  I would like another one. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sometimes I think that too and then I think, "Oh, then I have a whole eighteen years again to go through".
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  It's, kinda, cool now they're all spread out I have this old sixteen year old and then this really young two year and it's really neat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ...
L:  Well--
R:  A- a- --
L:  -- the sixteen year old can help you with the younger ones.
R:  Yeah.  And he is a good help -- I have all boy- -- all boys.  I wish I would had a girl in there but that didn't come out so ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But anyway, I'm pretty -- I -- you know, how -- how many kids can you afford anyway, really?
L:  Oh, i- -- I know.
R:  So --
L:  Ah, that's one reason I -- I still have one. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  You gotta --
L:  And, ah, it's a girl.  I mean, you have all boys.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Girls are so [LAUGH] expensive. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, that's what I hear.  I hear they're harder to raise too and everybody says, "Oh, you're so lucky" and I always think, "I don't know about that". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] No. [NOISE]
R:  But ...
L:  We ran outta stuff to talk about with smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  And they -- it seems like ten minutes is too long.  They should make it, like, seven minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Well ...
L:  It's been about ten minutes I think.
R:  Yeah.  It has.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She said she'd let us know so ...  What w- -- oh ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What -- what city are you in?
L:  Ah, n- -- I'm in Kenner.  We -- we're right outside of New Orleans.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  I can hear your accent definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So, what, you said Wisconsin?
R:  Yeah.  I'm all the way up in the Northern Vilas County before you get to Michigan -- Northern Michigan -- or Upper Michigan.
L:  There's some -- so you're not used to ho- -- any hot weather?
R:  Well, we -- the seventies is good for us.  When it gets above, like, eighty and higher then --
