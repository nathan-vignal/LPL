L:  [NOISE] Hi.  My name's Miguel Bernard.
R:  Hi.  I'm Bridget.
L:  Hey, what's up? [NOISE]
R:  Oh, not a whole lot.
L:  I guess they want us to talk for ten minutes.  Is that how it works?  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, we talk for ten minutes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about the topic.
L:  [NOISE] And it's what?  Smoking in bars, right?
R:  Um, it's smoking in general and banning smoking and, um, programs to stop smoking and ads --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to stop smoking.  
L:  They're -- they're banning the programs too?
R:  Well, there's -- there's -- there's programs that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, like, um, in New York --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- City they recently, um, banned smoking in --
L:  Yeah, in bars.  I know.
R:  In bars.  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but I guess, you know, I live in Indiana.  I don't know where you live.
L:  Oh, I live in New York.  So, I -- I know all about it [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  But they're looking at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at more than just that. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They're looking at, you know, the programs that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, like TV ads that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- encourage people not to smoke --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  And, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How effective do we think those are?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And what do we think about that?  And 
L:  [NOISE] Well, I mean, I have friends that smoke so [NOISE] they -- they feel like a little, you know, pissed off about it.  I think it's great, man.  I go to a bar or a -- a club now and I don't have to come off smelling like cigarettes.  It's cool. [NOISE] So, I'm fine with it.  You know what I'm saying?  So, you know, I don't -- I don't have like a big problem with it.  Man, I feel kind of bad that all my friends have to get up and go outside to smoke but honestly it makes it easier for you to sneak into clubs and stuff though. [LAUGH]
R:  How's that?
L:  'Cause all you gotta do is like, "I was outside smoking".  
R:  Oh.
L:  So, they're losing money.  These p- -- these -- these, uh, restaurants and stuff.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know what I'm saying?  So, it's like --
R:  "I was just outside having a smoke".
L:  So, you know.  So, they're the ones -- that -- and that's another thing that restaurants are hurt by it 'cause of that.  'Cause a lot of people like to smoke a cigarette right after they eat and stuff. [NOISE] So --
R:  So, there's absolutely no smoking in the restaurants period now where you live?
L:  Yeah, at all.  In all of New York, man.  It's against the law. [NOISE] 
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, so 
R:  'Cause we still have smoking and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no smoking sections.
L:  Yeah, so, you know, enjoy it while you got it. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't smoke.  In fact I have asthma really bad.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, I mean --
R:  And so --
L:  I mean, I don't --
R:  It wouldn't -- it wouldn't hurt my feelings if they said, "You can only smoke --"
L:  If they cut it out, right?
R:  Yeah, "You can only smoke fifty feet away from entrances away, you know, you know, a building".  
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Because, you know, that just drives me nuts to walk --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- up to a building and it's like, "Oh, god to get into this --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- building I have to walk through this crowd of fifty smokers on their break". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That sucks too.
R:  Um --
L:  They're actually thinking of banning it on the street too now. [NOISE] Like in front of bars and stuff.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  They were talking abou it.  They were talking about how like, you know, like that same thing.  That people are getting annoyed by it and, you know.
R:  I don't know.  I think there's a   As long as it's legal I think there's a limit.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  It's not like smoking impairs their ability to drive their car, their ability to do any of the other functions --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in their life. 
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  You know? [SIGH] It annoys me when I have to walk beside someone who's smoking a cigarette but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I can slow down, you know.  It's not like I'm +sitting -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sitting at dinner and seated at dinner.
L:  Right --
R:  And --
L:  I'm -- yeah, as far as the aspect of it being inside of a restaurant, I'm glad it's out.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, and the same thing with clubs 'cause clubs is like [NOISE], you know, the same --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thing, you know, you go in a club, you hang out there for a few hours.  Even if you don't smoke --
R:  And you come and you walk out and you smell like -- you smell like you smoke.
L:  Yeah, you come out and you smell like a -- you smell like a cigarette, man.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I don't like that.  Um, and it -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It irritates my asthma and it limits the places that I go into.
L:  Exactly.  So, you can go to a club now and not have a problem and [MN] --
R:  Wow.
L:  Not only that.  The air's fresher, you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  And -- I mean, I guess -- I guess the only -- the people that probably wouldn't know[?] probably be like the pot smokers.  Like you can't smoke at all in the club. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, if they wanna smoke pot it's like, "Oh, you're gonna get caught, man". [LAUGH] [NOISE] But, um, [NOISE] yeah, all the smoking on the street.  I don't think they should take it out of the street though. 'Cause I mean the street is like --
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm -- I -- you know, I'm sorry but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The street is the street.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, I can see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, not letting people drink on the street y- -- that's a whole different story.  That's a public intoxication.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's a drug.  It's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah, actually I'm kind of -- I mean [NOISE] --
R:  But --
L:  I think if somebody -- I think you should be able to have at least a beer, man.  I mean, if 
R:  Here you can't -- you can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- walk down the street --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and drink a beer.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I mean, you could have it in a cup or something. [NOISE]
R:  No.  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You're not supposed to be allowed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to have it in your car.  You can have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  A passenger could have it in the car but you can't.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [COUGH] Um --
L:  I'm against drinking and driving though so it's like, you know, I don't know.  Whatever.  The trains are fine though 'cause there's trains all over New York so you can just grab a train or a cab.
R:  Yeah, see we don't have a -- a pub- public transport system like you guys do.
L:  Yeah, you guys have to like really -- whoever's go- -- somebody definitely has to be a designated driver.
R:  Yeah, we have to have designated drivers. [LAUGH] Um, but --
L:  Plus out there there's like no -- no street lamps, right?  No street --
R:  Of course there's street lamps. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but I'm saying though like when you get like I don't know.  You live in a city?
R:  I live in [MN] -- yeah, I like in a city. [LAUGH] Lafayette, Indiana.  I mean, it's a --
L:  All right, see you're cool in the city.  I'm saying when you start going out.  Like I mean when I go to Long Island and it's like gotta put the high beams on, man. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, there are places where there are less street lights than like in -- in town but --
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  But they're still street lights. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know that.  That's what I meant.  Like when you go out of town like or at least towards the -- the outside part of town. [NOISE]
R:  You know, driving -- driving between like Lafayette and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Indianapolis --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, there's -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You can use your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- high beams because there's nobody. [LAUGH] There's nothing.  There's, you know, there's no -- there's no other cities and all that kind of stuff.  Um, but  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I think you should be able to -- I think you should be able to smoke on the street.  I think --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- you should be able to sit out in front of your apartment and have a cigarette.
L:  Yeah, did you hear that they were thinking of taking it out of the apartments too?
R:  I did hear that.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's a trip, man.  I mean, like, uh, you can't even by like free in your own --
R:  I did hear that.  That there's a Judge right now waiting to decide on whether or not to take it out of the apartments.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's insane.  That's a little too much and I think that they're pushing the, uh --
R:  Well, it depends on how the apartments are -- are connected.  If my -- if my air c- -- if my air is connected to your air and --
L:  Oh, you're talking like a central, uh, AC unit or something, right?  Or how would -- how would my air go into your air?  How would that happen?
R:  Um, I used to live in a set of apartments --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where, um, the -- like I have a window unit to cool my apartment.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but the apartment --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I used to live in I also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had a window unit but, uh, the -- like the air under the doors --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything went -- was a common hallway.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, people smoked --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the hallway.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It would come in under the doors.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
R:  Um, and there was a -- a duct that went from one apartment to the others that -- and -- that had at -- had at one time, I guess, carried heat because they didn't used to air condition these apartments.
L:  Oh, so you had to leave your window open?
R:  Yeah.  Um, and so at one time used to carry heat.
L:  So, the person downs- -- they lived down stairs?
R:  What's that?
L:  Did they live downstairs, or next door?  How -- how --
R:  And, um, but if the -- if the people next door to me had smoked --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then the smoke from their apartment would've come into my apartment.  It turns out that I didn't have any neighbors --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that smoked.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, but our -- the airways were all connected.
L:  Oh, really?  So, that -- that -- oh, so then that -- that's based on the building then.  That's not really based on like --
R:  Right, right. [NOISE] Um, and the apartment I'm living in now, no, it wouldn't make any difference except that the last apartment I moved into, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It took me two years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get that apartment to smell decent because for --
L:  To smell decent?
R:  What's that?
L:  To smell decent, you said?
R:  To smell decent.  A smoker lived there before I did.
L:  Oh, wow.  Interesting.
R:  And it took two years before I could like put my towels in the linen closet.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  I'm serious.
L:  Wow, that's nasty. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, because I -- if I put 'em in the linen closet then it -- within twenty four hours they would smell like cigarette smoke.
L:  Yeah, that's true, man.  I didn't think about that.  I mean, and --
R:  And --
L:  -- now that I think about it that's true, man.  Somebody's house that smokes a lot that would probably like 
R:  And it took two years and then I tore my knee up and I had to move to a new apartment 'cause it -- I had to move to a downstairs apartment.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but oh, it was awful.  You know, it took two years and by the time I get everything, you know, everything had finally aired out and -- and I could actually --
L:  Yeah, you messed up your knee, right?
R:  -- use my linen closet.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, I couldn't live there any more. [LAUGH] I was so bummed.
L:  Yeah, that's funny.
R:  Um, but   So, I mean, there's -- I can see a basis for banning smoking in -- in apartments because you walk in and -- and you move into an apartment and -- and the -- the person who moved there -- who lived there before me left all their cigarette smoke and I lived with it for two years.
L:  Wow.  Yeah, but I mean -- I don't know, man.  I go to a friends house that -- that smoke on a regular basis and I don't know I don't get that -- that sense like that -- that   It depends on the person, man.
R:  It depends on how much they smoke.
L:  Yeah, I mean, my -- my -- I mean, I gotta friend that -- I mean, he smokes like a pack a day or whatever but like, you know, like I mean even though he's trying to cut down but I don't -- I don't think that   Like when I go to his crib, or his apartment rather, like it doesn't -- doesn't stench of cigarettes.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So, I mean, I don't -- I think when he would move out I think it'll be fine.  I -- I think -- I think that somebody was really a slob and -- and a cigarette smoker. [LAUGH]
R:  I think it was a combination of both.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Someone smoked a lot, an incredible amount.
L:  [NOISE] Right, yeah.  They probably were real like --
R:  And never opened the windows.
L:  Right.
R:  And never turned the air conditioner on and was a total slob.
L:  Yeah, there's people like that.  Sometimes when I see somebody driving their car and they got the AC on and they smoke with the [NOISE] cigarette in there.  I'm like, "Are you crazy?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "You're doing double the damage".  So, but there's other people that I see dri- -- that -- that open the window and they have the cigarette outside --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they driving with the cigarette on the outside, then they smoke it and they'll blow the air out.
R:  But --
L:  You know, so --
R:  And --
L:  Yeah, it depends.  I mean, they o- -- obviously it sounds like they locked themselves in there and just kept smoking.
R:  But -- and as for
