R:  Hi, my name is Pumpidge[?].
L:  Hi, this is Michelle.
R:  Hi, Michelle.
L:  Hi.
R:  I quite could not understand, I thought it was censorship?
L:  Mhm.  Um, she said that it's censorship um like in schools like should public and private schools be allowed to um [SIGH] prohibit certain books from being read?
R:  Oh.
L:  That was the topic.
R:  Oh, personally I did not know that [NOISE] schools did that.
L:  Right.  I mean, I don't know what books they're talking about exactly --
R:  Uh-huh.  Same here.  I don't know what books um are -- are banned from reading.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I believe maybe it's porno or what?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Or is just like some sensitive books [NOISE]?
L:  Um, I don't know exac- I mean, there's certain -- there were certain um problems with like pr- ah -- private catholic schools --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not allowing like sex education and things like that --
R:  All right.  Oh -- okay.  Okay.
L:  -- but, I mean, I don't know if they're talking about that --
R:  Or if it's religious beliefs.
L:  Yes.  And -- and if anythi- -- you know, they -- I don't know how it is now, but they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- would even -- they would only teach um, you know, the creationist theory, not the evolutionist theories --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in catholic schools and things like that --
R:  Oh.  I had --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- no idea about that.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't study here.  See, I -- I was raised in India --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so my entire education was there, so I really don't know what they teach or don't teach here in schools.  My kids are small, they don't go to school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I don't know.  But um ah, what do you think?
L:  Well, I went to public school, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um I don't think there was really the -- I mean, all schools like have their basic curriculum anyway --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't know nowadays what kind of -- because they pretty much have the standards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they -- they teach with the -- the certain books with you read, like everybody basically reads the same things and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the -- in gr- -- I know like for a while um like I'm only nineteen now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm still in school actually like in college, but um I -- I read Catcher in the Rye in high school and I remember hearing like my teachers say that it used to be banned --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- from high schools --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and things like that.  And, you know, now it's like this classic that everybody reads in school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ah it's -- it's like --
R:  Some -- some point of time ago it was banned.
L:  -- yeah.  Things change over time, you know, like things that were once considered very controversial --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they don't become so controversial after a while and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's -- it's weird, but I mean I think that schools, they know what kind of topics they're teaching and they know what's appropriate really --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, you know, I don't think it's necessarily like censorship, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know.  How is it in India, like the --
R:  Um, no, I -- I really don't know if it was that big a topic.  We, actually, in India the way it -- it worked was we had our own syllabus and we had textbooks to adhere to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We did not have reference manuals like um like I've seen kids do here and they to the library and ref- refer to stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they work on proj- it -- it -- as um um when I grew up and I was studying, it's good if you do some extra research and um about the topic that you're learning, but you're not expected to.  You have a textbook and questions always are asked from the textbook.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Everything is chapterwise and you learn that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you study that and it'll be based on what -- what was taught to you.  So, it is basically all syllabus based.
L:  Right.
R:  It's not as wide as, you know, I've heard it is here, but I don't know.
L:  Right.  Well, I don't know.  I think um [LIPSMACK] the textbooks here, like especially the history textbooks --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- here are very, very conservative --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they're very um just kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- focused on, you know, American history and European history and that's it --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  -- I think if there -- like a lot -- I think Latin American history --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and Asian history --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- is h- very much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ignored --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  -- there's only like little blurbs about certain things, certain conflicts and things, because you learn American history and European history for so many years, you start in middle school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- here and like you know and then you repeat the same kind of courses, more in depth, in high school.  You -- you --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you do American history again and European history again --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But you never really fo- -- it never focuses on other parts, you know, you have like, you know, the wars and the development of, you know, the American colonies and everything like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's basically all you learn in high school and then if you want to go more in depth in history I guess you'd have to wait till college, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where you can do any history, you can learn about Latin American history, you can learn about Asian -- Asian history or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- any kind of history you want.  But otherwise it's -- it's very much ignored and it's just kind of like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- centers around that and I don't know --
R:  Okay.  Well, that is interesting because here if -- if it is -- it's good to be focused on a particular um ah part of the history but I guess because it's mostly inhabited by people coming from Europe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's why maybe over the years when the proportion of people from other regions increases.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they'll have a better ah say, you know, it's -- it's just like ah more people concerned that area, so it'll be more focused on that area.
L:  Yeah, because everybody thinks that, you know, they're kind of -- that's the most important history because it pertains to -- to them, you know, to --
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Right.
L:  -- like, you know, England and -- and -- and America, that whole -- and that's the main focus, but I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it just like ignores a lot of other influence on the development of the world and things like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I don't know, you never -- I mean, Africa is totally ignored and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- you know, other places, so as far as history goes, I think it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's pretty conservative and like even the, you know, the views of the textbooks of course, how they present everything is conservative and, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it has all the -- naturally going to favor like the US and you know of course if you go --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to Japan, to the schools or something and they're teaching history --
R:  There you have it [LAUGH].
L:  -- like the world war or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's going to be a totally different --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- perspective and, you know --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  But um and as far as like English classes go, with like literature --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I think they basically teach like the standard, like kind of classic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- books or whatever that aren't that controversial but, you know, you can get something out of them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, they teach like read Shakespeare and, you know --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- different things like that.  But yet again, like the authors that you read are mostly going to be American --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or European.
R:  Oh.
L:  In high school anyway.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I mean, I guess it's just ah the level of education.  Like once you go to college and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's you -- you're going to be exposed to a much larger --
R:  Right.
L:  -- larger area of work that you can study, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can study different authors from every region of the world and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so ...
R:  I -- I also think that maybe it is because um English is not so predominant in the other ah like English actually in Europe also English is not very predominant because every country has its own language, doesn't it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like dutch and ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- French and their major...  When you say European, do you mean English or do you mean entire European?
L:  Well, like what we study would m- we mainly study like I guess English authors or American --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but I mean there's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- also like you could read in translation --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like yeah --
R:  Excellent works of art from other regions are ignored.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I think so.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  Until you get to college and start --
R:  Right.  Right.  See, I -- I -- I probably am not the right person for this topic because I didn't study here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I have no clue, I have absolutely no clue.  But I see around and what I hear that's -- that's what I base it on, but you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I could hear the wrong things.  I could hear an opinion and not a fact --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if -- if it's based on religion, I -- I wonder what -- what -- what one should do if um if -- if your religious beliefs are totally against say, you know, like I believe catholics -- like you were talking about -- w- doesn't it create a conflict thought like at church or at home if somebody's trying to raise you on a religious ah basis, they'll teach you something and then it may contradict, or is it just reading, or is it taught at school, something that is against a particular religious belief?
L:  Um, well, I know that's like the conflict there is um in catholic schools they didn't want to teach certain things that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, like especially, you know, years ago in the south like, you know, they didn't teach evolution and things like that and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then, you know, those students are at more of a disadvantage because I mean they could still have their creationist beliefs but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if you're not even -- if you don't even know about this other information --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know and other people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- are learning it, you're learning so- you're -- you're at a disadvantage, because you're not --
R:  Right.
