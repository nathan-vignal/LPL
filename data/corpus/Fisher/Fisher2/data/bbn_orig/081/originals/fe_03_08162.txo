L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm John Porterfield.
R:  I'm Caroline Hall.
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  Uh, I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, good for you [MN].  [SIGH] How do you feel on the topic today?
R:  Uh, divorce hasn't affected my family at all.
L:  That's good.  I have --
R:  What about for yourself?
L:  -- I've had divorces myself --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and in my family.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, do you --
L:  But everybody seems to have resolved it, and everybody seems to be healthy.
R:  Well, that's -- that's the good way to approach it.
L:  That's right.
R:  [MN] Um, everybody doesn't have that healthy attitude.
L:  Well, it's part of life, I guess.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, it is.
L:  Unfortunately.
R:  And it's -- yeah, but it's better, I think, to [SIGH] dissolve a relationship and move on, than --
L:  Hold on [inaudible] unhappy or unhealthy one.  
R:  That's right, because that makes everybody else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- miserable if you -- and --
L:  Are you married?
R:  -- you get yourself in -- yes, I am.
L:  Yeah.  Are you happy?
R:  I am.
L:  That's good.  I happen to be divorced.
R:  Well, um, there's nothing wrong with that.
L:  No, no.  It's been a long time, ten years.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, how do you think that it has affected everyone [MN] elsewise, though?  
L:  Well --
R:  Otherwise?
L:  -- I don't think that it affected anybody at all.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] Yeah --
R:  But other than yourself personally, what --
L:  No, I've had a little time to think a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And make other relationships.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which are very satisfactory, much better than [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  Not marriage, but relationship --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- friends.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think everyone has to have someone to relate something to.
L:  That's part of life.
R:  It is.  I just -- I don't think we're supposed to be by ourself [SIGH] and live by ourself.
L:  I have a cat.
R:  But with no one to talk to, no one to relate anything or no one to enjoy anything with.
L:  Well, there's certainly affection round the place having a cat.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Yeah.  Any pets?
R:  Uh, we do not.
L:  You should --
R:  We have had -- we have had, but [SIGH] --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- um --
L:  They -- they -- they leave you after awhile.
R:  Yeah, they do and then when you travel it's difficult to put 'em somewhere.
L:  It certainly is, it certainly is.
R:  So, we just decided, uh, once they were gone we did not replace.
L:  Well, it's nice to have while you have though.
R:  Yeah, they are, and they're a lot of company.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, and I think they -- they help you -- help life as well, they're good and healthy for you.
L:  Living alone in New York, in an apartment in New York --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a multi apartment building, my cat is very helpful.
R:  I'm sure.
L:  Anyway, back to the topic --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- of divorce.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I know someone who got divorced, because, uh, they expected more money coming in than they got.  And, actually, after the wife spent a few years in low income situation, she decided to quit.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's not my personal one, it's one I know of.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She felt that he had lied to her.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Actually, what happened is something he was expecting to come in did not come in.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that can -- that can happen.
L:  That's right.
R:  Uh, and sometimes people are very -- or feel like they're being deceived.
L:  Mm, right, right.
R:  Um, when anything that doesn't go the way they expect it to, then I think quite often people look [SIGH] for something else to blame.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Rather --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- than looking at themselves for --
L:  Well, that's so true.  You are completely correct on that one.
R:  It takes -- it takes two, and there's always two sides.
L:  That's right.
R:  But you can't just blame one side.
L:  No, and you never know what'll happen as time goes by, too.  
R:  That's correct.
L:  People change.
R:  They -- that -- they do.
L:  They change a lot.
R:  And people don't always change together.
L:  That's right.  Some get older faster than others.
R:  That's -- that's very true [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And your expectations, what you expect --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- often changes.
L:  And you cause -- sometimes you feel the -- you're just [inaudible] caused by the other person.
R:  That's right.  
L:  [MN] Well, this is very interesting.  I have never participated in one of these before.
R:  Well, this is my second one, so, um, it's -- it's sorta interesting.
L:  Right [MN].
R:  To see --
L:  I suppose it's being recorded at the moment?
R:  Uh, supposedly, yes.
L:  And they get our accents and our voice?
R:  That's correct.
L:  And our thoughts?
R:  That's right.
L:  [MN] 
R:  What did you do? [SIGH]
L:  What?
R:  What was your profession?
L:  Television.
R:  Television?
L:  In -- I worked in the television industry a long time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Since nineteen thirty four.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It puts me way back then.
R:  Well --
L:  When the television pictures were --
R:  First [MN] out there.
L:  -- well, they had only one little postage stamp size.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that was before I was here.
L:  Well, unfortunately --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- unfortunately not before I was here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Anyway, yeah, but life is very interesting.  It has its problems, it also has, [SIGH] you know, it also has its successes.
R:  That's correct.  And you have to take the good with the bad, and I guess if everything was always perfect we could --
L:  You sound very optimistic.
R:  -- not -- well, you have to be.  Why not?
L:  Right.  It's a happy person.
R:  You know, if -- if everything was -- but if everything was always perfect, how could you enjoy it?
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, it takes some of the other --
L:  Yeah, to have a contrast --
R:  -- to make you appreciate the other.
L:  Yeah, have a contrast.
R:  That's correct.
L:  Very interesting.
R:  Uh, how many children do you have?
L:  I have a great grandson --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and two grandsons --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- one son.
R:  Well, that's an -- are they all living in New -- in New York?
L:  No, they live in various places.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My son is in Washington D.C.
R:  Well, that's not too far.
L:  And his son is in Baltimore, and his son is in Baltimore.
R:  So, they're not too far away.
L:  Not too far.  I see them once in a while.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is very nice.  You wonder how to explain yourself to a great grandson.
R:  Well --
L:  In other words, you know the great grandson at the age eight doesn't have a who the hell you are.
R:  That's right.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] Who is this character with the white hair?
R:  [LAUGH] That he sees occasionally.
L:  That's right. 
R:  It -- it's difficult for them [MN] to put everybody in perspective, whenever they're not in close proximity.
L:  That's right.
R:  Mm.
L:  And you're like a stranger.
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's right, because, um, they really can't relate it to anything, tie it to -- they can say, "Oh, yeah, you know, this is -- this is my --"
L:  But your ego says you have to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you feel sorta honored about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Feel sorta great, you hopes he's successful and healthy.  You hope his mother is fine -- who is divorced from his father --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but that's another story.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She, uh -- he is lucky to have a very good mother.
R:  Well, that's good.  
L:  How about you?  How many children do you have?
R:  I've got five.
L:  How wonderful.   All live within the area?
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, they're scattered.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, one in New Jersey, one in Kentucky, [LIPSMACK] two in South Carolina and one in North Carolina.
L:  Well, great, great.
R:  [MN]
L:  Must have a fu- -- family reunion once a year or two.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like Christmas and Thanksgiving.
R:  At one or the other, we tr- -- all try to get together.
L:  Isn't that great?
R:  It's not always worked that way, but sometime [MN] during that period of time we do.
L:  Well, you must have a wonderful time with them.
R:  We do.
L:  Good.
R:  Just the way [SIGH] you would like for it to be.
L:  That's right.  Well, that's --
R:  But, as I say, you just --
L:  -- you're a lucky one.
R:  -- you just don't see them as often as you would like to, since they are so scattered.  
L:  That's right.  But fortunately there's the telephone, other things --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you can talk to them --
R:  That's -- that's true.
L:  -- if you feel like it.  
R:  [SIGH] That --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- is a g- -- easy way to communicate.
L:  Right.  There's a certain amount of self consciousness in talking [SIGH] to you on a recorded telephone call.  [SIGH] You have to act a little bit.
R:  Right.
L:  If they're recording this for speech, you wonder if your speech is acceptable [LIPSMACK], or you wonder if they were saying, "Oh, my gosh, this fella isn't worth a darn".
R:  Nah, I don't think that.  I think they're really more after [SIGH] thoughts and --
L:  Speech accents --
R:  -- and the speech pattern, right.
L:  Right.  Well, yours is very nice, you're a pleasure to talk to.
R:  Well, thank you.  I've enjoyed talking with you.
L:  How many people have you talked to on this ...?
R:  You're the second person.
L:  The second person.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  I just joined today.
R:  Oh, well, if -- you were lucky then.
L:  And [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] someone else too.  [several inaudible words] have an interesting speech pattern because she was from England --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- refugee.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So her voice'll be a little different than mine.
R:  Yeah, they have a very distinct [MN] accent.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I was born in New York and raised in Texas.
R:  Oh, so that's a mixture.
L:  That's quite a mixture.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Texas is a wonderful place.
R:  A big place, yes.  
L:  And the people there are very nice.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think you find people nice everywhere.
L:  I went to school in Virginia, Roseberry School in Virginia, and back to night college in New York.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  New York's an interesting place.
R:  Yes, it is.  What part of --
L:  You ever -- you ever visited?
R:  Yes.
L:  Right.
