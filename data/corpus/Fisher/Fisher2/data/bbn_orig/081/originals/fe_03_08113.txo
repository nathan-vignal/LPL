L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Julie.
L:  I'm Mikey.
R:  What's your name?
L:  Mikey.
R:  Mikey?  Hi, Mikey.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  All right.
R:  What's the topic for today? [NOISE]
L:  It's, um, how do we feel about the ban on smoking in public places and how do we feel about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- quit smoking programs et cetera, et cetera.
R:  Oh, okay.  What -- are we supposed to, like, uh, [LAUGH] well, which one are we supposed to talk about first? [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  I -- [LAUGH] I -- I don't know, I guess the, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ban on smoking in public places.
R:  Okay.  Um, I think it's really important to ban smoking in public places because --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  Because, like, someone, like, who's pregnant or who has, like, pulmonary edema or chronic obstructive pulmonary --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like people who have, like, issues with smoke and, like, they're hungry and wanna go eat, I don't think it's right that they have to, like, involuntarily be in -- in an atmosphere that it's harm -- you know, potentially harmful.
L:  Hm, but -- but what if, um, what if a bar wants to allow smoking and only -- it wants -- it wants to be a place -- like, say the owner of the bar wants it to be a place where smoking is allowed and then that's explicit?  Should --
R:  You know, I think -- I think in a bar that's, like, an isolated, um, [LIPSMACK] I think in a bar, like if you're going to go to a bar, you have to assume that there's going to be smoke there too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think if you wanna -- if you wanna drink and -- and not have smoke, like -- like, that's the only exception.  I used to -- 'cause I used to work in a bar --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I mean, c- checkout beer and sit in your living room in front of your TV and drink if you don't wanna be -- hold on, Sophie, I'm on the phone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you don't wanna -- you know?  If you don't wanna --
L:  But the -- the --
R:  -- be in a bar.  I mean, I think a bar is the only exception.  I think a [NOISE] restaurant definitely -- definitely --
L:  It -- I don't --
R:  -- shouldn't --
L:  -- I don't think that it's right to force the restaurant to, uh, to -- to dictate a restaurant's policy on the issue, 'cause I think a [MN] -- say a restaurant wants to be a, you know, a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a top class place slash [LAUGH] cigar bar, you know, it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or something like that.
R:  Hm.
L:  They're making the regulations in a way that, ah --
R:  Yeah.  What about, like, having a separate section, like with the -- a closed door for smoking and then, like, a separate non smoking section?  Like, now it's just kind of, like, sectioned off by the area, but maybe if they had, like, an upstairs for smoking and then a downstairs for non smoking, do you think that's, like, more reasonable --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- then, that it --
L:  -- I mean, I guess -- I guess it comes down to if you want -- if you wanna make the rules in favor of non smokers or if you wanna make the rules in favor of -- of restaurant owners' prerogative --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and I th- -- I think it's -- I think it's more important to let the restaurants dictate it.  I don't think the government needs to be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- involved necessarily --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Now, what are the other two things that we have to talk about?
L:  Um, one was, uh, do we think that they should have all the m- -- quit smoking now plans for, uh, and ma- -- do you think groups and things like that are effective, I think.
R:  Oh, like should the government put for- -- towards, like, funding for these things or --
L:  Yeah, I guess. [MN]
R:  I don't e- -- I -- you know, I -- I wasn't even, like, listening to them. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, [LAUGH] she went through it so fast anyway and in th- that monotone.
R:  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I couldn't even hear it.
L:  But --
R:  Um, but, yeah, I think quitting smoking, I think you have to be, like, you know, dedicated to it.  I think if a person doesn't wanna do it and they're, like, you know, really negative about it, it's not going to work no matter what you do.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But it's a person's right to smoke.  It's, I think, their individual choice.  I think, you know, that those warnings are, um, on, you know, blatantly on the cigarettes and I think there's been more of an emphasis -- emphasis on the health hazards related to smoking.  I think any, you know, normal, like, halfway, you know [NOISE] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- normal person will be able to make their decision for themselves.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  No one's gonna quit, no one's gonna quit, you know, because their health insurance company is giving them two hundred and fifty dollars.  I mean, someone's gonna, you know, quit if they really want to or if there's a reason, like if they're pregnant, if they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have a heart condition, you know, if they're overweight, blah, blah, blah, blah, but I don't think people are gonna quit because there's programs and money or whatever. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, like I -- well, I think -- I think I agree with that if people wanna quit, there should be easy ways for them to.
R:  Right, like, if people wanna do it and they've made the first, like, step, it's a conscious choice, then I think there should be more, like, programs and outlets and -- but I don't think we should force it on people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- like as a society, be, like, "Okay, quit smoking because, you know, because we have these programs and there's funding for them" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think people -- as long as people are doing it where it doesn't hurt other people, I think that's fine.
L:  Hm.
R:  Um, but I don't think -- like, is -- is there really a link between secondhand smoke and, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like lung cancer, I mean, have --
L:  There's a -- there's a -- there's, like, if it's -- if it's -- I can imagine if you work in a bar then, yeah, you're probably taking in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a lot of smoke.
R:  But has there ever been, like, real, like, proven studies?
L:  Yeah, there has been, but it's all -- it's all minor, it's, you know --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- if you pump -- if you pump secondhand smoke into a rat's cage for, like, a couple of hours --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then the thing's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- gonna -- but it's, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I don't think there's anything majorly conclusive.  I think people have sued about, "I grew up in a home where you smoked and now I have cancer, and so I blame you" and I think people have gotten settlements out of that.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you have to be exposed for, like, a really long time.
L:  Yeah, it -- you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, if you go into a restaurant, and the only thing is --
R:  And have, like, an hour dinner, I mean, that's not gonna give you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your lung cancer.
L:  And that's the thing, the only thing, it's, like -- like, the non smoker doesn't say, is that it's a nuisance and that's fine --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I think it's --
R:  You know what bothers me about smoking more than anything?  The way people just, like, take their cigarette butts and, like, just throw them.  Like --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- that -- that bothers me more than, like the actual smoke itself.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah, I just think it -- it looks really, like, ugly and disgusting.  Like you'll be in a playground with children [NOISE] and you'll see, like, filters and, like, people's mouths were on them and I just -- I think that's really nasty, like, I think there should be more laws about that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- than the actual smoke.
L:  Hm.
R:  But ...
L:  Yeah, I don't even -- I hardly ever --
R:  There was, like, a third thing we were supposed to talk about too, but I don't even --
L:  Yeah, I'm not completely sure what it is, but it doesn't really matter anyway.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  So, how much more time do we have?
L:  I don't know.  I didn't look at the clock.  But --
R:  So, do you live in Philly?
L:  No, no, no.  I'm in --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- New Jersey.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, shut up, Mike. [LAUGH] My boyfriend's, like, "Do you wanna go out some time?" [LAUGH] Um, all right.  So, let's talk about smoke.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay, u- u- u- um, let's see.  What else can we talk about?
L:  Um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- so, yeah, the -- they banned smoking in --
R:  How about, like, making cigarettes like -- like m- -- filtering them more and making them a lot low tar, like having the same effect as far as, like, the nicotine e- entering the bloodstream is concerned, but making them more, like, environmentally safe?  Do --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you think that --
L:  -- I don't know.  I mean, the thing is --
R:  -- like, worth --
L:  -- smoking is, like, uh, it's like -- l- like people are going to do it --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and no matter w- -- but if -- I think that it has to gradually find its way out of -- out of --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Like there's no, like, one major step in it and raising the prices --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they're gonna have it legal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just, like, it -- it'll be like prohibition all over again, and I think --
R:  Yeah, it'd be like --
L:  -- I think it's just like --
R:  -- just raising the price of alcohol, e- exactly.
L:  It's the same thing with pot, like -- like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you keep it illegal and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and people are gonna do it one way or the other.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And -- and then that's going to spur on even more illegalities. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like smoking, like, the more --
R:  But I think the whole debate though with smoking is the secondhand smoke, like when you're drinking alcohol, only that person who's taking the sip is, you know, consuming the alcohol --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, yeah, there's indirect negative effects with, like, drunk driving, blah, blah, blah, blah, but --
L:  I don't think, like --
R:  -- uh, it seems the whole --
L:  -- yeah, see, I don't think secondhand smoke is that --
R:  Smoking -- what's that?
L:  -- is that big an issue.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I think I'm -- my pho- -- my phone is, um, dying here.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, we're heading -- heading north.  Um --
L:  You --
R:  -- anyway, yeah, and -- and the same thing with pot, like people are going to be in their home and smoke pot, but you're not gonna, like, you know, see somebody in a public place smoking pot, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But with cigarettes, I mean, it's anywhere and everywhere and there could be, like, tens of --
L:  Hello?  Hello? [PAUSE] Hello? [PAUSE] Oh, man. [LAUGH] We're supposed to get, like, ten bucks for this. [LAUGH] Ah.  Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot. [PAUSE] So, what, some -- some college kid is going to come and listen to this tape sometime?  Is that the deal?  Are -- are you listening to this right now?  Hello, are you dictating what I'm saying? [LAUGH] I'm going to try to hold out for the ten minutes, although the phone conversation's actually over.  I kind of hope it's recording.  So, you're at, what?  [inaudible] what you do?  I like it there.  It's nice.  That's good.  Um ... do you guys have any, uh, good fast food there?  Yeah.
