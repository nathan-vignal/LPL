R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Good.  My name is Freda.
L:  I'm Debbie.
R:  Hi Debbie.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  It's nice to meet you too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wasn't quite sure what they said our topic was, divorce?
L:  Family values and if, I think what they said is family values and if um the high divorce rate has changed our way of thinking.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Something like that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, it's been this way forever, since I've been a kid and I'm forty six, forty seven now, so --
R:  Yeah, I'll -- I'll be forty five in September, so, yeah, so that's about all I can remember.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My parents are divorced.
L:  Oh, and my parents aren't surprisingly enough.
R:  Really?
L:  Well, they're not alive anymore, but maybe the --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- maybe that's why they're not divorced [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, but yeah, no, um, they weren't so um one of the few families.
R:  Right.  Yeah because it -- it's kind of rare these days, that's for sure.
L:  It is, yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Um I guess it's easy for people to have a relationship, or to get into a relationship --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if it doesn't work out --
R:  They --
L:  -- actually these days, nothing's really wrong with divorce, you know it's --
R:  No.  It -- it's so easy.  It's easy in, easy out.  And um --
L:  Y-
R:  -- people don't even -- they don't e- they -- they -- they will quickly get into a relationship and -- and -- and give the false family hood even, you know, um, have kids without getting married, get married have kids, walk away from it so easily.
L:  If there -- if there are kids involved, it makes it a little more difficult, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but if there are no kids, then it's really no big deal, I don't think.
R:  Right.  Right.  I know um --
L:  So --
R:  -- I live in Florida right now and the school system that we're in um we have a high divorce rate, so there are a lot of single mothers --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Um --
L:  That's a tough job.  I have a friend who's a single mother --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- very, very tough.
R:  It's very tough.  And I mean, a lot of these mothers have three and four and five children --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Yeah.  And um I didn't realize that women were having so many kids still today.
L:  How did they, yeah, well, I -- they're not -- I'm from New York, they're not in New York --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- there's no way that they are in New York.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know, maybe things are different in Florida as far as that goes.
R:  Well, they -- I didn't think that they were ah we're from New Jersey, we've only been here about four years --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I was very shocked.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's a huge amount of children.
R:  Right.  And then to be doing it by yourself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then I am finding that um they have a couple of different fathers, so --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- yeah.  So, that is a values issue, you know, where um I guess this is where our question comes into view, um, that some of the values are very different.
L:  Well, has it changed the children, do you think?  Like the children's --
R:  Almost definitely.
L:  -- attitude, is that what is so wild?  I mean, we were wild, I guess, when we were growing up, but --
R:  I think our wildness was a little different because --
L:  I --
R:  -- the way these children are --
L:  Now they just don't seem to have any kind of discipline or any kind of respect.
R:  That's very true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and that's -- I see that all the time.  I'm President of PTA here at the elementary school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and some of the things that come out of these first grader and second grade mouths and --
L:  It's shocking, right?
R:  Extremely shocking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then when you call the parent or parents in, their response is appalling even [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't think that anything's wrong with it, or that -- that it's deserving, um, yeah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's sort of peculiar.
R:  Yeah.  So, I'm wondering if maybe because of -- of some of this, you know, there's a lot of parents too are very young parents and maybe they've come from divorced families --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and um -- and maybe because of the values that they were raised on or what they saw, maybe that does have something to do with it.
L:  It's an interesting -- it is an interesting question, yeah.  Um, it's funny because I -- I'm not married, but I've lived with someone for twenty five years, twenty six years.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it seems to work very well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, there's just a certain mutual respect --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if there's a problem with something -- and of course there are always problems -- --
R:  Problems.  Right.
L:  -- you know, you talk about it and you try and work it through because --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- he means something to me and I mean something to him.
R:  That's right.  Absolutely.
L:  You know, but do people leave marriages too soon, do you think, these days?  I wonder about that.
R:  Um, you know, sometimes I um I have a few, you know, a couple of friends that, you know, have divorced and stuff and -- and I think sometimes when the going gets too rough it's easier -- they find it's easier to walk away.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I am married, my husband and I have been married um thirteen years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we have two children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um, you know, we hit some rough times, but, you know, we never consider leaving each other.  Um, and --
L:  I mean, everybody's got rough times, it's part of having a relationship.
R:  Exactly, you know, you have to work through that --
L:  And part of growing --
R:  -- exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and you have to work through that.  You have to decide what's important and you know --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- we were important --
L:  -- exactly it.
R:  Yeah.  We were important to each other and our family was important.
L:  Maybe we don't know what's important anymore.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe a lot of people just really don't know.  I don't know.
R:  Exactly.  Maybe they get into the relationship for the wrong reason, you know --
L:  Yeah, a lot of people --
R:  -- sometimes people --
L:  -- do.
R:  Mhm.  A lot of --
L:  But a lot of people do it for a long time, I think, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We all want to be taken care of or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, people are -- of course people are lonely --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um --
R:  Right.
L:  But the fact is, it's really got to be with the right person or it's simply not going to work.
R:  That's very true.  That's very true.
L:  So ...  Yeah.
R:  You know and years and years ago remember when the marriages, you know, you -- you were promised to someone by your parents, you know --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- or your father and you may have been promised before you were even born and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you didn't have a say or a choice and remember those marriages used to last.
L:  Well, they still do that in certain places.  
R:  Right.
L:  I traveled a lot in the East --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um, in India they still have arranged marriages --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and a lot of Indian people who come here still have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- arranged marriages and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for some reason it seems to work.  Isn't that the weirdest thing?
R:  It because, you know, one party has no say [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, do they not have a say?  Ah, the women who come here seem to be quite strong, believe it or not.
R:  Are they?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  They --
R:  Because see that was the part I was always curious about.
L:  -- if they come here -- if they c- maybe in India it's different.
R:  Okay.
L:  But if they come here, obviously the family has money.
R:  Right.
L:  And if the family has money, the woman is not going to be somebody who's just going to, you know, take it, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah take anything --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, they're -- they're going to be stronger women --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um because they have the education --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have the Western schooling --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But yeah, it -- it does seem to work.  I have a family, actually a really strange thing.  The guy is without a doubt gay, I mean he's just --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- discussed it with me, the whole thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yet his p- you know, such shame or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so his p- and his parents didn't know that -- that he was gay and his parents arranged a marriage for him.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he's married --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's ah got a kid and he, you know, loves the wife --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you know, they have a very -- I think they have a happy marriage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But um the guy is gay.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it's like, I don't, you know, h- 
R:  An obligation.
L:  -- I don't know, maybe they find a different way to live with stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the -- the --
R:  Obligation and he honors it and he's found a way to love her and --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  So ah --
L:  And -- and um just different e- family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, that's family values also.
R:  There's values.  I was going to say --
L:  It's -- it --
R:  -- that's values and he's sticking to his values and um and his promises.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  And that means a lot.
R:  That means a lot.
L:  Yeah.  And people don't --
R:  And see, we Americans --
L:  -- stick --
R:  -- we're very lax when it comes to things like that.
L:  Oh, totally.
R:  We're very lazy and lax.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we take the easy road with everything and so many of us -- and I say us not meaning necessarily myself, but just so I don't think I'm superior -- --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but we always thing somebody owes us something and, you know, just want the easy way with everything.
L:  Yeah.  And we -- yeah.  And we want it to be our way and only our way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I used to work in a law firm and um I mean these people just did nothing, so lazy, such poor --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- workers --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and they just didn't get it.
R:  That's right.
L:  And I'm thinking, "You're getting paid, why don't you just put in an honest day's work" --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I was always making less money than them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They'd go to the movies during the day.
R:  Right.
L:  And they're the ones bitching.
R:  I know.
L:  It made no sense.
R:  I know.  It drives me up a wall.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I have --
R:  Drives me up a wall.  And you ask them to do one thing, "That's not in my job description" --
L:  No, they don't want to, "That's not my job".
R:  That's not my job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just --
L:  We -- we have --
R:  -- kills me.
L:  -- left a lot of values --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in this country, unfortunately.  I don't know if it'll bring us down.  It -- it actually probably has already brought us down.
R:  Oh, oh, it most definitely has.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't know that we'll ever be able to recover from it.
L:  Oh, probably not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably not.
R:  Uh --
L:  Um --
R:  Spiralling in the wrong direction.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, how do we get the values back?
R:  That's a good question.
L:  We had -- it's -- I live in New York and I live very close to the Towers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where the Towers were and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, it's amazing how kind people were --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for a month afterwards --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's like our values just turned back --
R:  Yeah.  I was hoping --
L:  -- to what they used to be.
R:  -- so much that that would last.
L:  What?
R:  I was hoping so much that that was going to last.
L:  No.  Yeah, well, so were we.  Um, it lasted a month.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then people were nasty.
R:  Again.
L:  It was so amazing to live in New York at that time.
R:  At that time.
L:  It -- it was actually in -- in a way it was a blessing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that this happened --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because it turned us around --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and taught us what's important -- 
R:  Important.
L:  -- and taught us our values again --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which we lost immediately.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Which is very, very sad.
R:  Very sad.  Very sad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  And -- and that's all over because I even notice it down here, you know, because I'm in um South Florida, very close to Miami --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, so, you know, we have the Hispanics, the Haitians and -- and some of the Arabs, I mean, because you know you've just got all these cultures just diving into this area --
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  -- so you have so many different prejudices, you know, coming in over here and it's -- it's very horrible to see sometimes and the things that some of the kids have to go through --
L:  Oh, it's horrible.  Yeah.
R:  It's --
L:  It's totally horrible.
R:  Yes.
L:  I travel all over the world and um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I go to a lot of south e- a lot of third world countries and a lot of south east asian countries and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the -- the thing you learn from travel is that people are people --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you know, we're all really the same --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we actually all have the same --
R:  Right.
L:  -- exact values.
R:  Values.  Right.
L:  You know, but we sort of lose them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or something.  We all want the same --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- happiness and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- peace and joy and simplicity and family --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and food --
R:  That's
