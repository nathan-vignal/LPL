L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  This is --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- Kate.  Who is this?
L:  This is Judy Ratliffe.
R:  Hi, Judy.  I -- I didn't hear what they said about the second of the um thing.  I heard that we're supposed to talk about ban- ah banning smoking in public places, but I didn't hear the second half of it.  Did you hear that?
L:  Yeah.  The second half was banning smoking in public places and if ah helplines and help clinics and things like that are really worth, you know, doing, if it helps people quit or not.  Ah, that's something I don't know.  I've smoked since I was a kid and I've tried all kinds of things and never been able to quit yet, so I don't know whether it helps or not.
R:  Ah, I was a um, a three pack a day person and I quit.  I quit about twelve years ago.
L:  Did you?
R:  Fourteen years ago.  Oh yeah.
L:  Do you feel better?  So, do you -- do you really think then by ah banning smoking in public places that it really is a health thing, or --
R:  Oh yeah, I -- I -- you know, I don't know if you're a mom or not but when you go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- through the whole process of raising your kid and watching over them and stuff like that and you hear that secondhand smoke is more dangerous than actually inhaling the [inaudible] yourself, I -- I really get angry at people who you know smoke in front of my child because it's sort of like, "Okay, if you want to do that to yourself, that's fine, but if you're going to be putting your secondhand smoke on this child that I've raised and kept safe for all these years, then it becomes an issue with me".
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] I can understand that.  I can understand that.
R:  Mm.
L:  I understand the whole idea of trying to keep the kids from smoking.  I agree with that, um, I have an older daughter, she's --
R:  Yeah, unfortunately --
L:  -- twenty seven.
R:  -- they learn from --
L:  I tried to keep her from doing it, but --
R:  -- their environment.
L:  -- it didn't help.  She smokes --
R:  And if you --
L:  I have a --
R:  No, but I mean if you use -- if you use like I --
L:  I -- I don't think it was all from --
R:  -- used to use smoking --
L:  -- me.  She --
R:  -- to relieve --
L:  -- has a lot of friends --
R:  -- stress.
L:  -- that smoke and everything --
R:  And so that was my --
L:  -- too, so --
R:  -- method of -- of what I did when I was stressed I would take a cigarette out and I -- if the child did not know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a different way to handle stress, that's the first way that they're going to learn to use.  Now, if they're taught other ways of handling stress then I think that even if they're in an environment with smokers they will -- will have other patterns to emulate. [PAUSE] 
L:  Well, I've always taught mine that if they get to where they're that bored they'll get on their bike and ride or ah my oldest one just has plain roller skates, my youngest one has roller blades and like I told 'em, there's always something to do.
R:  Well, how do you feel about um the bans --
L:  Whether it's getting on their bike and going --
R:  -- in a lot of places, because you're still --
L:  -- to ride or getting on your skates --
R:  -- a smoker?
L:  -- and going skating, you know.  Besides, the [PAUSE] -- um, I think it's rather discriminatory.  I think the way that um our McDonalds up on North Vermilion[?] here in Danville[?] first did it was really the best way, they put in a ah private section with glass around it and a door ah to where smokers could go in there and smoke and then they jumped on the bandwagon of absolutely no cigarettes at all.  Um, to me everybody else yelling discrimination about all the other stuff, I think a smoker has a right to yell discrimination too.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know --
L:  But I can also understand --
R:  -- if you ever saw that [inaudible] but --
L:  -- the other side about people --
R:  -- when I was smoking, I was --
L:  -- saying, you know, I don't want your secondhand smoke --
R:  -- fully aware that it was --
L:  But I -- I still think it's rather --
R:  -- a slow way of committing suicide.
L:  -- discriminatory.
R:  I mean, there was no question in my mind that this was you know a -- a sort of a self abuse kind of a thing um and you know I took my satisfactions over the fact --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that it felt good, you know, it -- it raised my um ah ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sugar levels and it provided all kinds of -- of biochemical you know changes in me that -- that felt good and it also made me not want to eat and kept my weight down, which was neat.  I -- I liked all of those aspects of it.  But I'm not -- I never pretended this was any kind of a healthy ah or a positive sort of a -- a thing and I -- I all -- felt like it was my own addiction, you know, or a very serious addiction and so um when I did get in situations where people would ask me not to smoke, um, you know, I would struggle with it because I was very seriously addicted, I mean you -- when you're smoking three packs a day, you're seriously smoking.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]  [PAUSE] Yeah.  Yeah. [PAUSE] 
L:  See I -- I still only smoke a pack a day, even though I've been smoking now for probably thirty seven years.  So, um, if -- that's like I have a brother and sister in law that he quit smoking a way back, way back, I mean probably twenty seven years ago, it's been a long time.  And everytime I went to their house I wouldn't smoke and they told me, "No, you can" and I said, "No, I won't.  This is not a smoking home.  I'm not going to come into your home and stink it up with cigarette smoke."  So, I'd step aside.  Um, I even did that with my Mom and Dad for --
R:  So, when you go to a restaurant and they have a --
L:  -- quite a while.
R:  -- policy there of no -- no public --
L:  But ah --
R:  -- ah smoking --
L:  -- I've never ever had disrespect --
R:  -- in public places, you -- you feel --
L:  -- for people who don't smoke.
R:  -- that --
L:  -- that's why I don't like the way --
R:  -- it's discriminatory rather than --
L:  -- smokers are treated.  I know what --
R:  -- it would be like --
L:  -- I'm doing --
R:  -- at your parents' house --
L:  -- you don't have to berate me like a child --
R:  -- where they'd smoke saying that you would [inaudible] --
L:  -- and ah that's what I get upset about. [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah, my -- my friends smoke do that.  I think that's the -- you know, they have restaurants saying that they'd still allow it and that's where they go and ah they um um are, you know, find their space getting smaller and smaller ah --
L:  Um, most of the time I won't go where you cannot smoke --
R:  -- where they can go.
L:  -- at all.  I usually go where they do have ah sections where you can. [PAUSE] Right.  [PAUSE] 
R:  Well, the -- I've worked in the um [MN] in --
L:  Well, you know, if it was to where --
R:  -- the health field as a -- a scheduler --
L:  -- there was only like ten smokers in the world --
R:  -- and one of the things I found out is that --
L:  -- you know what I'm saying?  Okay --
R:  -- sometimes there are laws that --
L:  -- I can understand that --
R:  -- are in place --
L:  -- I would then respect you on that --
R:  -- that [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- but there's still quite a few smokers --
R:  -- for instance like a helmet law --
L:  -- out there and -- and ah --
R:  -- but when you go --
L:  -- I just --
R:  -- up onto the wards --
L:  -- I don't know, a lot of times I -- I --
R:  -- and you see all the people that didn't wear their helmets --
L:  -- just feel like they're trying to berate us, like -- like --
R:  -- that are now wards of the State --
L:  -- children.
R:  -- and it'll be paid for by the State for the rest of their lives in -- in a vegetative state, I think the same thing could be said of -- of smokers as well, you know, that you know you're going to get to a point where you're going to have serious um yeah and -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- most people are not going to have the money to be able to pay for these kinds of ah services that you're going to need and so it becomes a public burden.  And --
L:  Forever. [PAUSE] 
R:  Well, I -- no, I'm -- I'm fully aware of that --
L:  Consequences.
R:  -- no, I'm fully aware of that.  I -- I -- I have seen the list of States that have --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- um, you know, ah accepted the payments from these um smoking lobbyists --
L:  But there on the other hand, that's why all these States sue the tobacco company --
R:  -- and um --
L:  -- and now --
R:  -- that they have er- --
L:  -- all these people that --
R:  -- that is earmarked for that has mostly gone into education --
L:  -- asked them to get that money, where's their money getting their help on their medical bills?
R:  -- um, of the young, but there's very little --
L:  They're not getting it.
R:  -- been set aside for --
L:  The State is keeping it for other things.
R:  -- helping older smokers that are going to be --
L:  Check it out sometime, check and see how many --
R:  -- facing long term consequences with our help.
L:  -- of those States are using that money.
R:  And that -- that's probably why there's a lot of State um emphasis right now on trying to get social security and all of those other public works programs sort of in place because to -- already spent the money, you know. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Right.  Right.  I think it was ah -- I think it was just a pretty crummy way of the States doing what they did.  I -- I think if they were -- actually cared about these people that were saying um, you know, um "I smoked all these years, the cigarette companies made it sound good" which I think is foolish, I think anybody who says that, to me you better watch everything they do because I knew way back in the -- in the ah seventies and that when I started smoking it was not good
