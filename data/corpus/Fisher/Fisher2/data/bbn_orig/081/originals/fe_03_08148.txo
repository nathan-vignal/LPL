R:  Hi.  My name's Alex.
L:  Hi.  My name's Lyn.
R:  Hi, Lyn.  Uh, [SIGH] well, I'm at -- I just got a DLT which is a [inaudible] transportation, uh, I just got tested about a week ago and scheduled to get tested again, um, mm, let's see in about another, uh, [LIPSMACK] fourteen days.  So, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I just got a class A which is a CDL license, commercial drivers license, a tractor trailer license and it's a lot of responsibility.  Um, you really have to have your wits about you.  Uh, stop and go traffic and [inaudible] work on physics, uh, inertia and gravity and its sort of weight and if you're not on top of it, uh, you know, you could really hurt somebody.  I mean, the truck doesn't get hurt but [inaudible] around you can get hurt and if you're taking it too, uh, too fast a speed or, uh, or you're not familiar with the road, uh, you can really get yourself, uh -- as far as like something like -- I also worked for an airport [several inaudible words] Airlines for a while as a [inaudible] and I got [inaudible] a lot there too and the problem with that was [LIPSMACK], uh, we lost a, uh, [LIPSMACK] we lost a door over, uh, the ocean, uh, uh, when a plane was on its way to Hawaii and a, uh, stewardess got, uh, got sucked out of the aircraft and, uh, we really got tested and we got enquired --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- about, you know, how we locked the door and the method in which we used to lock the doors a- and, uh, it's a lot of responsibility.  I mean, people put a lot of, uh, uh, trust that, uh, you know, you know your job and you're -- and you're doing it properly and -- and there just isn't any room on the -- on a flight deck with all the aircraft coming in and change over and, uh, the intake that, uh, these jet -- jet aircraft are capable of and when they can suck you right into an aircraft if you're in the wrong place, I mean, they -- [several inaudible words] how close you can be to an aircraft actually painted on the surface of the envelope on the ground there where the -- where the plane parks and, uh, if you're too close when that jet starts, uh, uh, winding u- -- winding up it -- it can suck you right in and it's happened to a few guys, uh, that we've been told throughout the United States.  So, um, drug testing, uh, when you have responsibilities like that are, uh, I think [inaudible].  But, uh, a lot of companies, uh, test you if, um, y- y- you're not, you know, responsible.  They just test you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or -- and go through your criminal history and go through your financial history and, uh, simply because, uh, [LAUGH], uh, they wanna know the person that they're hiring.  Well, how much privacy do you have, and how[?] much do you owe the company that, you know, just down the road might just like kick you out in the street [inaudible] taking best years of your life, you know?  Uh, you know, people, uh, party festively and, uh, on -- on weekends and -- and, uh, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe it's a deterrent.  You know, maybe it saves their lives.  Uh, I don't know.  Um, what are your feelings? [PAUSE]
L:  Well, at, um, my place of employment they don't do drug testing but it's an insurance company.  So, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't have a problem with it.  Um, I think anything that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- works for the good of the most people I'm fine with it and that philosophy goes in other areas too.  So --
R:  Well, in other words somebody could -- could just, uh, you know, do a witch -- a witch hunt on you and say, you know, "I've got a problem with person -- I think that person might be, you know, taking drugs or you don't seem like the right", and then somebody someone walks up to you and says, "Listen, we'd like for you to -- to the bathroom and have someone accompany you there and give a sample".  I mean, that's kind of invasive. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah, but I think the -- the testing should just be, you know, like when you're hired or like you're saying in areas of -- of responsibility that -- then they can do it, you know, randomly but other than that; no.
R:  Well, I -- I don't -- if you're hired initially with the company, uh, especially an insurance company, I mean, they're the ones that are demanding all this, uh, they're the ones with the loudest voice here.  They're making these companies test everyone and put -- and then the cost of testing is forty dollars a test and they're saying like, uh, "You know, before you hire this employee, whether it's, uh, uh, uh, an administrator or a, um, uh, someone who, uh, is responsible for a powered -- a powered, um, uh, vehicle, uh, we want that person tested and we want it in the record".  Um, that's sort of like, uh, +invasive.  Uh, I -- because they're starting to intrude on what you do with your life and how you live your life.  Uh, I'm not saying that, you know, you -- anyone can go out and do whatever they wanna do but, um, people are entitled to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, make their own choices and there [inaudible] -- there are laws, you know, to protect[?] the mass and you're right, you're correct that, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The overall, uh, uh, the job o- of the government is to protect the majority.  Yeah, I believe in that.  But as far as like how, um, how much of your [inaudible], your ability to, uh, have your own personal life and how much a company can infringe on that, um, that's questionable to me.  Uh, I -- I'm not saying that, uh, uh, it hasn't in the past.  It has in the past.  People have like, uh, you know, throughout -- at least since the last thirty years, uh, been [inaudible], uh, at least --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- weekend hippies.  Uh, they would go out and they -- and they would like be in San Francisco where I -- initially [inaudible] San Francisco and they're like -- they were these teachers and these professors and they were out there [inaudible] and, uh, handing out, uh, LSD to these people and then they returned to their suit and tie on Monday morning.  Now, uh, now someone would come along to them and say, "Look, we want you to give us a sample".  Uh, then that does infringe on their ability to, uh, what was called, uh, revolution of the sis- -- sixties and their revolution [COUGH] meaning in turns of [LIPSMACK] ability for culture to change.  And our culture changed a lot since the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sixties.  The standards of -- of living and our -- our -- our cars and our -- our -- our -- our music.  It all changed, uh, there pivotally at the sixties and, uh, that would have infringed on -- on our ability to be, uh, have [inaudible] behavior, uh, which was occurring at the time.  So, it stifles us.  It sort of like, uh, blocks us, uh, from -- from freedom to decide whether or not we wanna be left or right.  Uh, it sort of makes everybody right and, uh, and everybody has to kind of follow on whether they don't get to, uh, to participate in, uh, fulfillment of the constitution which is your right to, uh, happiness.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Uh, uh, what does -- I'm not saying that [COUGH] it's right or wrong because I have two children and I'm concerned about who influences and what influences my children have, uh, because I want the best for 'em.  You know, I wanna see 'em, uh, uh, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] education and throw it down the tubes because they're not paying for it --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  You know, I don't wanna see any tragedy happen to 'em because I love 'em, they're my children.  But at the same time I -- I -- I want them to be able to make choices on their own and the choices that they make I hope that they -- they develop them in home under the guidance that we gave when they were younger.  Uh, my daughter asked me -- she's graduating from high school.  She's eighteen and she said[?], "Dad, can I have a beer party[?] at your house?"  Um, well, in this State it's twenty one.  You know, you can't drink until you're twenty one and so, um, that was really a bothersome question because, you know, I don't want her to learn how to drink in the streets or, uh, or at least not give her all the facts about alcohol, it being a drug and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how it can affect you and s- -- I wanted her to have some guidance there but at the same time I don't wanna be the one sponsoring and having to look at the other parents that are gonna arrive and say, "My child's been drinking at your home with your approval".  Uh, I think I have a tough time facing a -- a Judge at that time. [PAUSE] Oh, yeah.  You can find yourselves pretty well, uh, losing just about everything that you've earned.  Uh, if some parent felt that, uh, that was [inaudible] out of line.  So, that's a difficult thing.  Do I inform the parents before I allow them to come to my house?  Uh, [SIGH] uh, uh, the -- or do I allow my daughter to go out and --
L:  No.
R:  -- and learn how to drink in the streets, uh, or behind somebody's pavement --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, you know, I mean, I want her --
L:  And they're cracking down so, too.  You know, that you're a resp- -- the responsible party.
R:  -- to be in control and her want her to understand that drinking's a drug and that, uh, you know, you have to take it in doses as you would any other drug.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, but I can't do that if, uh, if I can't, uh, uh, be part of her social life because she's gotta keep it away from me.  She's gotta, um, uh, because she felt that I'd, uh, I'm -- I'm -- it's against the law and so she's not gonna tell me she's breaking the law.  Uh, and -- and drinking leads to other things so hopefully not lead to other things but, you know, it's, uh, present time and you got yourself [several inaudible words] as the people that are influenced.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I would hope that she have a clear idea of, uh, responsibility to herself and her body and -- and that, uh, she's taking, uh, something natural to her.
L:  Mhm.  Right. [PAUSE]  Yeah.  A- another area that I'm glad it's a drug -- drug test-
