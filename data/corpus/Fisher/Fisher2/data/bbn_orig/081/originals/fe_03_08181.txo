L:  Hi, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- this is Quentin.
R:  Oh, yes, my name is John [SIGH].
L:  [MN] John.
R:  Uh, I'm ha- -- having a difficult time understanding what the recording told us --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the topic of discussion is.
L:  [LAUGH] The topic of the discussion is -- yeah, I know, I understand the -- um, family values.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And I think how does -- another part of it was how does, like, the current divorce rate [SIGH] does -- has it affected your views on -- on marriage.
R:  Oh, oh, that's what they were saying.  It sounded garbled.
L:  Yeah, I know it did.
R:  Uh, well, I suppose --
L:  It was -- there was a little more to it that I -- I missed.
R:  Oh, and, yes, something about, uh, do we think marriage is, um [LIPSMACK], oh, I forget.  Uh, they don't do a good job of explaining what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the discussion topic is.
L:  I guess how to -- I guess it's just about, yeah, about marriage and family values.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, yeah.  Well, I guess, you know, when there are children involved --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, divorce makes it very difficult for the children.
L:  That's true.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, but I guess if there are no children at all, then the divorce is simply between two adults who no longer get -- get along.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I don't imagine that's all that damaging.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Do you think, uh, part of family values is kind of staying together to -- to -- because of the kids?
R:  [SIGH] Well, that's what a lot of people advocate, uh, [LIPSMACK] when they hear that people are in rocky waters or thinking of separating.  A lot of people, uh, [SIGH] uh, say, uh, "Oh, I told them they should remember the children [SIGH] --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- they should stick together until the children are graduated from college and they're on their own --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- or until they're age twenty one" or this or that.
L:  [MN]
R:  And, uh, I've heard people say that, uh, [LIPSMACK] parents should remain together, even though they may not be able to, uh, uh, they may not like it, uh, until the children are grown and on their own.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] I guess there's -- for me, I don't think there's any hard and fast rule, because people live their lives differently, but, um, it -- it seems like a lot to ask of -- of a person to stay in a marriage for that long.
R:  Oh, yeah, especially if they realize, uh, when they have small children, [SIGH] that they're no longer compatible.  Or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that their marriage was a mistake.  And then they're looking at fifteen years, uh, stretching out ahead of them [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with a partner who no longer appeals to them. 
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  So, it's a tough struggle.
L:  Yeah, and who knows if that is even better for the kids?  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, yeah, I don't think there -- they've been doing many studies though, on that topic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about whether the children of, uh, early divorcements are as well adjusted as other children.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Although maybe one of these, uh, research groups might take that up as a topic.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] Maybe.  Um [SIGH] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I didn't get the feeling though that the divorce rate was, um, [MN] very high lately [SIGH].
L:  I, uh, I heard it say that it was something like fifty per cent.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It sounds -- that sounds awfully high.
L:  That does sound really high.  I don't know if it's true, um --
R:  [MN] Maybe that's in -- in a certain area, like in New York City, uh, the divorce rate is something like that. 
L:  [MN]
R:  It can't be nationwide.
L:  That could be.  I know -- I know people are getting married later in life now though.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Maybe that's just as well.
L:  You think that has something to do with the, uh -- I guess that has something to do with education being -- people going to -- people get educated for longer --
R:  [SIGH] Uh, well, that's true.
L:  -- than in the past.
R:  Yeah, because when they're in college and then if they go on to graduate school or to professional studies --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Mhm.
R:  -- um, yeah, they generally spend more time in school with their, uh, scholastic work, less time available for horsing around or dating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that might cause them to simply postpone marriage, and, uh, get married when they're thirty instead of when they're twenty two.  
L:  [MN] Interesting how the, uh, [SIGH] how the market -- the job industry or whatever affects the family.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah, that's, uh, that's certainly a good, uh, point, you know.  [SIGH] Um, i- it's very demoralizing to the worker, especially if it's the, uh, the husband and the father --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, to become unemployed and then have a difficult time [SIGH] obtaining a new position --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or if they're in a, you know, self employed type of situation, uh, floundering about for lack of customers or whatever.  So, it's very difficult for the children too.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And I'm sure it's a greater --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- strain for the parents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They do have to try to keep up appearances, and [SIGH] always seems like everything is so expensive for children nowadays.  Nothing is a dollar.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Everything's at least five or ten.
L:  Yeah, I -- [MN] it seems like -- I w- -- I get the impression that sort of traditional family values really more for, like, an older world.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, well, I guess so [MN] --
L:  'Cause --
R:  -- maybe they had people like me in mind [SIGH] --
L:  -- I mean --
R:  -- people of my age and generation.
L:  -- oh -- well, I think that -- I think that the male -- I think the man of the house is not necessarily, like, the breadwinner any more.  And so, that changes things up a lot.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, well, not primarily the way it used to be in earlier -- in earlier generation.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  There are more women working now outside the home [LIPSMACK] and, uh, many of them are actually quite successful --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a- and they're even more successful than the husband in the, uh, money department [MN].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Although, you know, actually [MN] one of the advantageous aspects of both parents working, [SIGH] um, there's two pay checks coming in.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it -- it's easier to provide for a higher standard of living for the family [SIGH] and, uh, you know, get more things for the children when there are two incomes showing up every, uh, every pay day in the house.  
L:  That's true.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, and I think that also helps to cushion the blow of unemployment if one or the other parent does become unemployed.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Previously, uh, the wives used to stay home, it was only the husbands who worked, [SIGH] and when they became unemployed, wow, that was a real disaster.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But nowadays if they both work and they're both doing full time jobs [MN] it's not as harsh a situation when one of them becomes unemployed. [SIGH] At least there's, you know, the salary of the other one [SIGH] to tide them over for a while.
L:  Mm.  [SIGH] Um --
R:  It's probably awful if they both become unemployed together.
L:  Well, yeah.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's probably when they start getting on each other's nerves, I imagine.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's probably true.  Um, family values.  Are you from the city?
R:  Oh, yes.  Actually, I live in New York [MN].
L:  Mhm.  I -- it [MN] -- I -- I'm -- I didn't grow up in the city, but I see kids who grow up in the city, and it must be -- I don't know, it's such a -- it's just a different childhood.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think it --
L:  I -- I -- I feel -- I feel like they're so exposed when they just walk down the street.
R:  Uh, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I think it's a little more dangerous [SIGH] and I think it's a little more [LIPSMACK] -- I think the -- I think that children nowadays become more knowing [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at an -- at an earlier age [MN].
L:  I won- -- I wonder how knowing they really are though.  [SIGH] I wonder if it's sort of, uh, [inaudible] I mean, [MN] they don't know enough [MN].  I mean, like, they -- they know, but then they -- they have this kind of [MN] unqueried grasp of things.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, well, judging --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- from the o- -- I don't have any children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I only go by observation and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what I see with my own nieces and nephews.  [SIGH] But they seem to be pretty tuned in to, um, to [LIPSMACK] what the father does, what his earnings are, what the mother does, what her earnings are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they seem to have a clear idea of just how far they can go [SIGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not one inch beyond [MN] and, uh, uh, they seem to be fairly knowledgeable, I think, about a lot of the, uh, social trends that we see in society.
L:  You think that -- that is different than --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- children of twenty, thirty years ago?
R:  Oh, yes, certainly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, when I was a kid we were so ignorant it was pathetic.
L:  Really?
R:  [MN] We were in -- we were happy, we were blissful.  We didn't know anything about it.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  When I was a kid, fifty years ago, I didn't know what my father earned.
L:  Wow.
R:  Didn't matter, either, I always had whatever I wanted, so --
L:  Yeah.  You --
R:  -- it wa- -- it was a different world back then [SIGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, actually, it was easier in those days for the man to support a family.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, in those days one salary went far.
L:  Mm.
R:  Nowadays, um, I haven't -- I don't know how they could manage it [SIGH].
L:  Right.  No, um, I think the whole job market is becoming more of a temp work --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and freelance work.  And, uh, jobs without benefits and there's so much more of that.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.  [MN] That's one of the -- that's -- that's actually, um, [LIPSMACK], I think that just an old, indust- --
