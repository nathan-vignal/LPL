L:  Weird.  Hello, my name is Sylvia.
R:  Um, my name's Sharon.  Ah, I'm from ah -- I live in Kentucky.
L:  Oh, I live in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What do you think of the topic?  I think it's kind of a strange one.
R:  Yeah, a little bit strange.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because they -- they can come up with some pretty ch- strange topics, though.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  The last conversation I had was on hobbies and so that was a little bit easier, but --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've had that --
L:  -- I guess in terms of high profile trials, I'm sorry, it just seems a little funny to me.
R:  Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
L:  Um.
R:  I know, about the only one I've really even watched was OJ's --
L:  Yeah, I watched that one --
R:  -- trial.
L:  And I guess the Lacey Peterson trial, I kept up with even though it seems like I don't really want to.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- can't seem to help myself.  Um --
R:  I ah [LAUGH] yeah, you -- you kind of get addicted to ah the trials, ah, you know, once you start kinda watching them, but I don't know.  I -- like I said, I -- it's like you said, it's a strange topic. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know I --
R:  I g- --
L:  -- I guess if I had to -- had to say anything about it, I would think they probably shouldn't be televised because  I think it compromises um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the defence and ah I think it causes information to be leaked out that probably shouldn't be in ah occasionally can taint the jury if they have to ah you know find new people or --
R:  But, even though they're -- even though they're not supposed to pay any attention to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what -- what's on TV or ah in the paper or anything, people's human, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're -- they're -- they're only human, so it's kind of hard not to be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- influenced ah I know I was on a jury ah you know once and you know they tell you to rule out something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if that's -- the objections ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- upheld and but it's already planted in your mind.
L:  Right.
R:  A- --
L:  And I think if you know the public wants you to vote, or not vote but [SIGH] um decide a certain way, it's kind of hard to kind of sway yourself from that --
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  -- ah --
R:  -- no matter how -- how -- and like the -- the -- but then again, I -- I don't know, high profile people are out there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before the public, you know, the public's interest in what goes on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with them and so --
L:  I think it's sad that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah it's taken such ah -- ah entertainment side of things, instead of it being --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- informative and people wanting to see justice done, it's -- it's become entertainment for us and --
R:  Exactly.  And then the lawyers --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- play to it, too.  I mean --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they -- they don't take it to be a lawyer as much as they take it to be on -- in the spotlight.
L:  Right.  There's this new --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- show, I don't know whether you've seen it or not, it's ah a branch off of Law and Order, but um it's like live trials --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's unscripted, um, real people, real lawyers and you can tell --
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.  And it's -- I don't think it's a very good show.  But I -- I watched it once and you can totally see if the lawyers play up ah want things to be more dramatic, dress and act a certain way --
R:  How they're -- yeah.  How they're acting it.
L:  -- yeah.  I -- I think it's really detrimental to the whole process.
R:  Yeah.  Making a mockery out of it, more or less.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've never seen that stuff on TV.
L:  [LAUGH] I wouldn't really recommend it, but --
R:  Okay.  I won't watch it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I guess the -- the trial that I -- just the Lacey Peterson thing, I ah -- I don't know and just the whole circumstances of it, I -- even though --
R:  Now, is that the guy that -- the guy that killed his wife?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  On Christmas Eve?
L:  Right around it, yeah.  And she was like seven months pregnant.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And I -- 
R:  Now, I've been watching some of that, too.
L:  No, I mean he hasn't -- he hasn't been tried, we haven't seen any of the evidence, but at this point --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] when they finally caught him and the way they caught him, I was like, "Oh, I don't care if he fries or not, he deserves it" --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I know I shouldn't say that, but --
R:  Well, anybody --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- p- that was -- that was kinda strange from the very beginning, any -- anybody that ah would go on a camping trip on Christmas Eve with their wife six or seven months pregnant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, that just didn't add up [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  But --
R:  He really wasn't a very smart murderer, really [LAUGH].
L:  No, not at all.  But um --
R:  But --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it was splashed all over -- really Fox News, I think.  Um, and every -- every time you'd turn on the television, it's like there were lots of other things that were going on at the time, um, in particular, you know, the impending war with Iraq and um --
R:  Yeah.  That's what I --
L:  -- you know, the economy and stuff that's going on in the -- just the legislative plans of government just kind of all got preempted um so we could all watch that and um --
R:  Yeah.  That -- that didn't make a lot of sense, did it?
L:  No, I don't think it did at all.
R:  Like -- no, I agree with you.
L:  Um, I think Court TV is just -- you know, again it's like I -- I know I shouldn't watch it.  There's certain things where I'm like, I don't -- I don't know why I'm watching this.  I can't -- I -- I -- I think it's horrible, just it's kind of like um passing by um an accident and you feel like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, turning your head --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but ah, yeah, I don't think -- I don't know, I just think it -- it really taints matters, especially when they really start pumping stuff out before they even have an indictment yet.  You know, I --
R:  Well, that's right.  And they don't ha- they don't have a jury yet, either, do they?
L:  Yeah.  At that point, no.
R:  Do they -- have they?  E- yeah, that's -- and that's what I'm saying.  That everything that's on TV and everything, it has to influence the jury.  M-
L:  Right.  'Cause you can't --
R:  Even though it's -- yeah, even though you say you're not going, you know, you're -- you can be unbiased, I just can't hardly believe people can be.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  I was in um, God, I think it was eighth grade, when the OJ Simpson trial was um being broadcast on television --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and we watched some of it in my um social studies class and ah I -- I think that was just one of the most polarizing horrible things I've ever seen [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I don't know, I think in some ways I think it would have been better if you could just hear it over the radio, just the smug look on people's faces, it was just, oh, horrible.
R:  Yeah, it was.
L:  But um -- I don't know, I don't --
R:  And then --
L:  I think it --
R:  -- ah, it was just -- it was just kind of a circus, I thought.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  I think -- and things got totally blown out of proportion and people weren't paying attention to the right things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um --
R:  And that was the lawyers' purpose.
L:  Yeah.  True.
R:  Yeah.  The --
L:  That's -- that's their job.  That's why you hire 'em, so --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't know.  I -- I'm trying to think of another high profile case.
R:  Yeah, I'm not --
L:  That's been in the news lately.
R:  I can't think of too many that's ah --
L:  No.  I mean I guess um, it's not a high profile case because they haven't brought any of these people to justice yet, but um I guess in terms of ah the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, I think that's probably not getting enough attention in the news --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because there are -- I think it's like six thou- not six thousand, excuse me, six hundred people that are being detained and um I guess when you're a military detainee you don't have -- you don't get the same treatment --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that you would in terms of having a fair trial and so --
R:  Yeah, they do it on their terms.
L:  Exactly.
R:  L- yeah, that's --
L:  So, they could just be down there indefinitely and ah I was reading ah the news the other day and apparently there is um [LIPSMACK] a small number of ah British citizens that are stuck down there and there's nothing the British government can do to get them out and --
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that -- wouldn't that be terrible, I mean --
L:  I mean, if -- if you didn't do anything.
R:  Exac- 
L:  Especially um they rounded up um a lot of people, I guess Middle Eastern people, they had Middle Eastern men go and register again with the INS and then a lot of those that did were deported, regardless of whether they did anything or not, just the fact that they'd gone in and registered was enough for them to get booted out of the country.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And I think things like that, you know, I understand that we're at a heightened point, um, of security --
R:  Security, yeah.
L:  -- and um we need to pay higher attention and um, you know, we need to do background checks on people, but I certainly don't think that's fair, I don't think that um we should completely circumvent the constitution --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- so --
R:  There's a fine line, you know, that you've got to -- of what's [several inaudible words] for our safety --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then you can cross over and be an invasion, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's -- it's a tightrope --
L:  I --
R:  -- type situation.
L:  I guess if -- if that were to be high profile, I -- I wouldn't object to that, but I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in certain cases, I think it's very intrusive to the families especially and, you know, [LIPSMACK] children in the families, I don't -- I don't think ah [LIPSMACK] I don't think the news media thinks about them at all.
R:  Well, that -- that's like the -- ah that's like the Kennedys I know there are books out about them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, let the poor people rest in peace.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know?
L:  I -- I think that's horrible --
R:  Ah --
L:  I don't -- I don't even know why someone would do something like that.
R:  You know, that's -- and negative things, it's about high profile people after they're dead, I mean, they're dead.  Leave them alone [LAUGH].
L:  I think there's -- there's no need to try that in the court of public opinion, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, what -- what could we possibly say other than, "Ooh, that's just in poor taste", you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I --
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know.  Oh, did you hear, um, it was in -- in the news, I think about a week and a half ago, um, [LIPSMACK] ah the police chief who was in charge of um [LIPSMACK] the Melville Sniper case wanted to write ah a book about ah his involvement and they wouldn't let him because they said that he had some sort of gag order placed on him because he was the sheriff or what
