R:  Hi, my name's Mary.
L:  Hi Mary.  My name is Sherry. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi Sherry.  So, what do you think you'd do?
L:  Um, well, that's one of those kind of things you hope you're never faced with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, I'd like to think I would be calm, but probably I would be terrified and in a panic.  Ah one thing that might make a difference is whether I have my kids around me or if it was just me --
R:  Right.  I don't know.  I think the first thing for me would be I would be calm and kind of like in denial, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it would be hard to accept.
R:  If it -- if it actually -- if I started to get hurt, like if they -- if they came and they started to hurt me physically, then I would start to panic.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I think that would make a big difference, whether there was physical torture or, you know, your life was threatened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it was just property, you know, that kind of thing can be replaced --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe it's easier to -- to maintain a calm.  Have you traveled very much recently, since the terrorist attacks [inaudible]?
R:  No, I haven't, but um when that nine one one thing happened, I started having um dreams [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and one of the dreams I had was that I died in ah um car explosion, but I wasn't in the car, it had to do with a car blowing up and radiation spewing out.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  That -- that was two years ago.
L:  Wow.  Well, that -- I've been through several airports since then and different places like ah Pearl Harbor or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, NASA Headquarters, things like that and -- and the security, it's very interesting how much they make you go through as far as screening and, you know, metal detectors and all that kind of thing.  And it's amazing to me that even after all those kinds of things apparently they still have people trying to be inventive that can get on a plane and -- and have other weapons or, you know, it -- it really is a frightening thought.
R:  [inaudible] Well, the thing that's frightening, really, though is that the government could be in on it and it could be a covert plan, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Mm.
R:  That -- that's the frightening thing because if it was just the terrorists and then they came and attacked us, that would be one thing, but if -- if there's a whole lot of different issues going on that set it all up, that -- that's what's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even scarier.
L:  Well and -- and I think that's one of the things that would bother me the very most about it and probably why I'd be the most terrified is because usually the terrorists are cowards and they're not attacking who they have issues with, like the government, it might -- you know, they -- they pick on innocent people who really have no control over the -- their grievances and problems.  I think it's a real cowardly thing they do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  [SIGH] Well, you know, you wonder why people never grow up.
L:  Well, that's true.  I -- I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  You see kids doing things like this and then they grow up and then they become mean people.
L:  Well, that's -- yeah.  
R:  You know, bad -- bad kids grow up to be bad people if they don't get reached early.
L:  Well and I -- I think --
R:  But in those culture --
L:  -- I think it in a lot of those kind of cultures, like you're mentioning the terrorists come from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they train their children to be this way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  It --
R:  Yeah.  And that's what's even scarier.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know.
L:  Because you never know when you go somewhere if they've got those kind of attitudes.
R:  So, you've been in another country lately?
L:  Um, well, I -- I just got back from Hawaii not too long ago and I -- I really noticed then how much tighter security was, going through the airport, you know, um they frisked my whole family and we don't look mid Eastern, my daughter is extremely fair --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and very blond and she had to go through a metal detector and be frisked twice and --
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  -- you know, they made us all take shoes off and run 'em through metal detectors [LAUGH] I mean, it was -- it was pretty tight security and I thought, "We've sure given up a lot of freedoms and rights because we're --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- I guess everyone is afraid of what could happen", you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you want to feel safe but it -- it's kind of frightening to think that not too long ago we had gone to Florida and it was the same kind of thing, there was so many checkpoints and going even into places like Disneyworld they searched all your bags and carry ons and -- and I know when we -- when I mentioned we were in -- in Hawaii, we went to Pearl Harbor, they wouldn't even let you carry a purse or a fanny pack or anything.
R:  Wow.
L:  You -- I mean, you could carry a camera, but it had to be a small one.  No camera bag --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- out to the Arizona Memorial to -- because I guess they're so worried about what someone might do in a terrorist attack and it -- it really --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- has infringed on all of our privileges and rights.
R:  Well yeah, and you don't know whether um Saddam Hussein or the other -- the other guy is gonna try something um --
L:  Or any of their follower --
R:  -- on a holiday or some- --
L:  -- yeah.  Well, and -- and that's frightening, especially when we have big celebrations like today and large gatherings in stadiums to shoot off fireworks and that kind of thing, you never know if they're going to use this as a -- a place where they think they can make a statement.
R:  Mhm.  This one place I -- I was living in Missouri, they -- at the local town in the carnival they were having somebody was threatening that they were going to shoot off a bomb or guns or something --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- right while the fireworks were gonna go, so it's kind of -- I think scared some people from going there at that time.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I haven't noticed too much here in my local area, people being real concerned and not going to, you know, big crowd things.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Utah.  We just had the Olympics here and --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  -- and I can tell you about terrorist threat there because there again there was awfully tight security --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fortunately no problems, but, you know, places like um we have a -- a big fourth of July celebration called Stadium of Fire --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you know there's a lot of people --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- going to it, I haven't heard anyone that's afraid to go because they're afraid of terrorists.
R:  I'm in --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  -- Idaho right now.
L:  Oh, is that where you live?
R:  That's where I'm living now, yeah.
L:  Oh, what part?
R:  I've been here for eight months.  Um, Pocatello[?].
L:  Oh, I -- I know that area pretty well.  My sister lives in Blackfoot, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we drive back and forth past Pocatello.
R:  Yeah.  I don't drive, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I walk and I take buses.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's kind of a handicap nowadays, isn't it?  Not to be able to drive.
R:  Mhm.  Well, that's why I moved somewhere where I could take a bus --
L:  Yeah, you need a good --
R:  -- where I lived in a small town in Missouri there was nothing for me there [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'd been in Missouri for thirteen years and I was there when the nine one one thing happened and um and I moved out here eight months ago.
L:  Hm.  So, are you liking it there?
R:  And I like it a whole lot better.
L:  You -- you like it?  Climate wise and things?
R:  I like it here.  I wish that I'd been here to begin with.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think h- have you been through the winter there yet?  Yeah, you have, huh?  So, was it --
R:  Have I what?
L:  Have you been through a winter there yet?
R:  Yes.
L:  Did you find it real cold?
R:  But it was mild, they -- they say it was a mild winter compared to usual.
L:  Yeah, I think last year was.  Where my sister --
R:  But even so --
L:  -- lives, they get pretty cold.
R:  -- even so, the dry cold is a lot better.  And dry snow is a lot better than the humidity in Missouri.
L:  What part of Missouri were you in?
R:  Well, I was in the south for most of my thirteen years there and I finally got used to it and then I moved up north, by Kansas City --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then the heat and the cold both were so different that I could hardly stand it.
L:  Hm.  Yeah, it's a lot more humid there, isn't it, than it is in this part of the country?
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I'm originally from California, so ...
L:  Oh, well so you're used to more the dry heat, aren't you?
R:  Well, yeah and in Missouri I got to where I finally got used to the cold, but or the heat even, down in the south, but then I moved up north, it would be up to a hundred with the humidity and that I just couldn't handle.
L:  Oh.  Now, that would be pretty bad.  I -- I don't care for the humidity, I -- I like the dry [LAUGH].
R:  But what it is is when it's really super hot then that's when most of the crimes happen and I think on that nine one one thing it was hot that day, probably.
L:  Hm.
R:  What do you think?
L:  I don't know.  I -- I hadn't really --
R:  I know that I hadn't turned the news on, because I don't wa- never turn the TV on in the day -- morning and I got online and then the people in the chatroom were all telling everybody to turn on the TV because um -- because of what happened and then I -- I had cable at the time and I turned it on and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- "Oh boy" you know, that was just so wild.  So --
L:  What chatroom were you on?
R:  Yeah.  Huh?
L:  What chatroom?
R:  Oh the L- LVS chatroom in Yahoo.
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  And ah --
L:  I ah -- I had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just driven my kids to school and
