R:  Hi, my name's Shelley.
L:  Hi.  My name's Debra.
R:  Hi Debra.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  So, you know the topic of the day?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Do you want to start?
L:  Um -- I --
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  I haven't done it before.  Have you?
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I have, actually on my third call. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So ah --
L:  You can start [LAUGH].
R:  The subject of the day is ah family values, has it changed the way that you are, in your life and do you think that ah that it's changing because of the increase in the divorce rate in the United States.  Well, I live in Canada, but I'm sure [LAUGH] I'm sure it's the same there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I would -- I would say ah definitely, like family values you pretty well have to have families to have family values, do you agree or what's your view on it?
L:  I -- yes, I -- I definitely agree with that --
R:  So, how have you -- how -- how it is like say in your community, do you -- like I -- I've just got back from traveling today and actually one of the last places that I was at and they were saying, "Oh yes" you know, "It seems to be a real common thing like and sort of the baby boomer generation" their kids have sort of like grown up now, leaving college and it seems there's this huge rash of divorces.  Are you noticing anything like that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in your area that you live in? [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah um [LIPSMACK] um I have kids that are fairly young and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a lot of their friends come from divorced homes and I think it's very sad for the kids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they're torn between the two households and they don't have any roots um and I -- I feel --
R:  So, do you f- e- --
L:  -- it's a big detriment to our society --
R:  -- part of the thing that I see that say like was different for example when my parents, you know, like last generation, like divorce wasn't so common, but women didn't work out of home, so it was like sort of people I think tended to more work together, whether it was good or bad, I don't really know.  Like I know that, you know, that things weren't as [inaudible] say family v- like if a woman was in a bad relationship she would stay in the house rather than move out.  And I don't disagree with those options, but I do think that because women have money these --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- days that people tend to sort of like ditch relationships a little faster than they would have twenty years ago when people stayed together for all these --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- for these all these other reasons, the kids, the money, the -- so, it's kinda changed that way, too.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Yes, I think you're right.  Um, it does give women more freedom to choose those types of options --
R:  Right.  And do you -- do you think --
L:  -- and I think they're exposed to more --
R:  -- people sort of like expectations --
L:  -- when they're working outside the home --
R:  -- of what we think a relationship is supposed to be has changed --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- over the years, too?  Yeah, definitely.  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Probably from television and -- and --
R:  So --
L:  -- movies, which is another problem.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the young kids of today, they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they don't learn any commitment to anything and it's just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a throwaway society and that's actually how they probably --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- go into these marriages.
R:  But you sort of see that too because it's sort of like --
L:  Without much --
R:  -- "Oh, you're here to make me --"
L:  -- thought of longevity --
R:  "-- so happy" and sort of like what values, like the thing that I've noticed and then knowing friends who are psychologists --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they say it is that because ah men in our society haven't reached that level that women have of being able to like say [several inaudible words] to open it up and admit to our problems, and she says that men don't have that outlet, be able to admit, she says that they have casual relationships --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but have deep meaningful relationship is sort of lacking.  So, when you look at that and you compare that to our families, it's just starting to change where men are taking a role where, you know, like the father's approach was to talk to, not just the breadwinner, you know, sort of a different ah -- different role.  I know because my dad I never talked to.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mind you, we considered him to be, you know, an outstanding father, you know, it seems like dads these days are expected to be whole different --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I do.  I definitely do, but it's a slow -- it's a slow time coming and I sort of wonder if --
L:  So, you think that it's a change for the better?
R:  -- I don't know if you -- like we all have like these expectations of, you know, like, "Oh, we're supposed to be rewarded with money", you know, like we've got this Hollywood image like, "Oh, we're supposed to have money.  We're supposed to have happiness.  We're supposed to have the perfect kids or the --" and you know what, life's just not like that.  Kids get sick, things happen.  Your husband loses his job and all these other things and so like, if you had this ideal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you think, "Oh, well, look, my life isn't working because the kid is sick.  My husband's not making all this money.  We're not living in this house.  We're not" you know and tend to ah deteriorate family values, what's really important in life based on what society tells us is important in life. [PAUSE] Mhm.  And we tend to want some sort of like -- like if we haven't achieved certain financial milestones or material milestones --
L:  I -- I think that the key factor is --
R:  -- in our life, we deem that as being --
L:  -- exactly what society tells us.
R:  -- happy or successful is -- a good example of this the other day.  A woman in a beautiful Jeep Cherokee, you know, ah --
L:  True.
R:  -- four by four, right, there were two small children in the back of it and I thought, "Oh", you know, she was dressed so nicely, her hair was perfect, she was dressed lovely, her vehicle was just, you know, gorgeous and there she is and she grabs at the one little boy out of the back of the door and then grabs the daughter out and she's standing on the street --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- screaming and yelling and screaming and yelling.  And I thought to myself, I thought, the value and the price of the kids just spilt pop in your nice car --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and yet, you know, this is how it made you act.  Is it really worth it, having that nice car when you have kids?  You know what I mean?  Kids spill.  So, sort of how do we treat people based on what to is another thing, like just to keep -- keep it all up, keep it all nice --
L:  That's --
R:  -- whereas I think that's sort of our grandparents --
L:  That's really true.
R:  -- had more of a I -- I don't know, like you didn't have a lot, so you tended to, you know, like you valued your family, you valued your children, you valued your friends, it was sort of like and -- and what I heard too these days is people buy insurance companies whereas before --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- they'd have less families.  Yeah [LAUGH] No.  So, it I- it has changed like as far as that goes, definitely.  I think that's going from being an agricultural based society to the now we've changed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to where we all live in our little nuclear --
L:  That's true.  That's a good -- 
R:  -- family unit.
L:  -- that's a really good point.
R:  So, we're all sort of isolated, separated from the lives of other people.  We don't let the li- we're too busy to let the lives of other people impact on us.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that tends to ero- and -- and yet, what I've heard too from statistically speaking is that say like youth crime and all that stuff is actually on the way down.
L:  That's right.
R:  So [LAUGH] it's not like kids are getting worse and yet that's what our impression is that every thing's just going in the wrong direction, from what we hear on the news.  Shut those TVs off [LAUGH].
L:  Hm. [PAUSE]
R:  It seems that they are the most --
L:  Right.
R:  -- effected --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- I know it ah --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it does seem to be and it's like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- kids will blame it on themselves.
L:  Yes, well I -- 
R:  No matter what.
L:  -- it's really sad --
R:  They just seem to think --
L:  -- how divorce does affect the kids --
R:  -- "No, something isn't wrong, well [inaudible] something to do with it" and talking --
L:  They don't --
R:  -- to friends of mine who've lived through having their parents divorce have said the same thing, they said, "No, for the longest time I really thought that I had something to do with it or if I only would have been better or done --"
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  "-- something different" [PAUSE] Right [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE] Right.  Yeah.  And, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it seems like ah -- I don't -- I don't know --
L:  And then if the parent remarries and has a new family --
R:  -- I sort of think that ah like for family values and all that stuff --
L:  -- the kid sees the new family as a --
R:  -- kids right from a really early age --
L:  -- as a unit and they're --
R:  -- need something and I -- I'm --
L:  -- just an outsider who's --
R:  -- not saying exactly -- something like --
L:  -- not really a part of that and it's really sad.
R:  -- an AA program, but in -- like a just that tw- a twelve step program, that's what I -- a twelve step program that starts in school that teaches them how to create values, how to solve problems without turning other [inaudible] violence, anger, stress, alcohol, you know, being a [several inaudible words] that's something that's lacking that we just don't arm people with the tools they need to be able to go out there and function.
L:  Mm.
R:  And yet we seem to think that, you know, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, you know, you know how to run -- run your computer, you know how to do this, you know how to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sit in front of the video game, you know how to do all these things, but we're not taking that real time to find out what we can do for people to sort of, you know, instill values in them because they're not getting at home.
L:  Yeah.  I think you're right about that.
R:  So, I do- it's a very complex subject today.  The last one I talked on was movies [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And today [LAUGH] and the one before that was minimum wage, so this one's yes, it's hard work.  Far more complex. 
L:  Mm.
R:  So, do you have any other thoughts on [PAUSE] family and divorce rates --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and [PAUSE].  Has it changed -- has it changed like say like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- all of the divorce rates like in all of this kind of stuff and deterioration --
L:  -- much easier.
R:  -- has it changed the way that you live your life?  I know that it has changed the way that I live my life, I'm planning right now --
L:  This one's depressing [LAUGH].
R:  -- to move out of the city, move to a small isolated rural community [LAUGH] just the very reason I got back from there and it was just --
L:  Well, um --
R:  -- wonderful because you walked down the street and everyone's so friendly and they all do know --
L:  -- well, I don't --
R:  -- what you're doing but it's just kind of nice not worrying about locking your car door or anything like, it's a real [PAUSE] 
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] Yeah.
