R:  Hello, my name's Tonya.  I'm calling from Hawaii.
L:  Hi, my name is Josh Bernstein.  I'm calling from New York City.
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, um, you heard the topic about, uh, sch- -- public schools or private schools?
L:  Right, and censorship.
R:  And censorship, yeah.  And now, what -- I'm a teacher, uh --
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yes.  And --
L:  So you've got first hand --
R:  Well, and it's interesting too because I'm a math teacher, but next year, because of the cutbacks in our students, I'm having to teach English for the first time, so this is a real interesting topic [MN] for me. 
L:  [LAUGH] See, I'm coming out of this from left field right now [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Um, so what's -- well, what are -- are -- how old are you?  Student or ...?
L:  Um, I'm twenty four.  I'll be twenty five in about a week and a half.
R:  And do you have any kids?
L:  Uh, no kids.  I have a girlfriend, but no wife and never been married.
R:  Okay.  So, what -- what do you feel about the -- being -- teachers being required -- um, um, students being required to read certain books in school?
L:  [SIGH] Um, [several inaudible words] of course I was required to read so many books when I was in school, I see nothing wrong with that.  It's not a problem when it's being censored, and [inaudible] told they can't read certain books.
R:  Uh-huh.  And so, in your school, [MN] in your school when you were required to -- did you ever have any issues with the parents coming?
L:  Uh, we never had any issues with the parents.  We didn't have any of that Catcher in the Rye hubbub that happened.
R:  That was [LAUGH] -- I was gonna say [MN] -- say about that.
L:  We never had -- I mean, I read that book, or the Great Gatsby I read, and I read all the classics in school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We didn't have a single problem.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I grew up in Dayton, Ohio, so it's not the most liberal place, but we had a pretty liberal school board, never really had too many problems.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.  So -- so as far as you're concerned, uh, the freedom of speech issue is the one that should take, uh, take precedence here?
L:  Uh, could you explain?
R:  Well, in terms of, um, being able to -- actually that's not -- probably not a poor way of putting it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but, um, as long -- as long as it's not pornographic, um, there's a -- there -- it should be not objectionable for -- I mean, in other words, it's not -- if it's not against the law [SIGH] it should --
L:  As long as it's not against [several inaudible words] but, I mean, some subject matter I feel is [several inaudible words] and you should be able to reach a certain age where you can make your own decisions.  [SIGH] And so [several inaudible words] forced to read Lady Chatterley's Lover in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- high school, I don't think that's appropriate in the least bit.
R:  Yeah [SIGH].  Oh, well, what would you -- if you were a parent, what would you do about it if a teacher -- and I'm not saying a teacher would do this, but you do have teachers that kinda go weird sometimes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so if that happened to you, and -- can you project what you would do?
L:  [MN]
R:  If you -- if you felt it was -- let's say they were asking your eighth grader to read [MN] a sexually explicit book and you didn't think it was appropriate at that time, [SIGH] what would you do?
L:  You know, I'd almost be inclined to let it go, because, I mean, I grew up -- maybe I'm a different case, but I grew up -- I was reading adult books when I was in third and fourth grade --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I was reading, like, sexually explicit books when I was really young --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I don't really think that hampered me as --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it helped -- I think it helped me as far as growing up more than anything else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Because that's exposed to those things, [several inaudible words] coddled and had to read all these, like, little kids' books all the way up until, like, ninth, tenth grade, [SIGH] when all of a sudden this door sort of opened and, like, all these new books --
R:  Right.
L:  -- were --
R:  Right, then officially you can read things, yeah.
L:  I mean, there was the library there.  The kids can go to the library and take out any single book, you know, so I'm -- if the teacher at the school's getting money from government or something like that, then they have a whole different regulation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] So then if a teacher was [inaudible] to my kid, I mean, I'm not really one for censorship in the least, so I'd let them read it.
R:  Yeah, well, [inaudible] personally, that's the way I am too, 'cause my parents were very open about all that kind of stuff [MN], and about sex too, and their [SIGH] -- their vision was never to not read anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they didn't push it or say it one way or the other, it was just -- it was left to me.  [SIGH] Um, I've -- I don't know what I -- being Hawaii, the -- it's pretty -- it's actually pretty liberal here.  The thing we have more than anything is, uh, probably the religious objections to things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For instance, if [SIGH] a science teacher wanted to teach, um, some kind of evolution thing that [MN] -- and really, [MN] assigned a book that said creationism is horrible --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or whatever, [SIGH] that would probably upset some people here.  [SIGH] But I don't s- -- I also don't think that's gonna happen 'cause of most of the teachers here are aware of that and don't do that sort of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's not a prob- -- big issue.  Although, I'm -- I -- I -- I was trying to figure out what would happen if, uh, I did assign a book and -- you know, 'cause you try to pick books that will fulfill --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- your [SIGH] educational purpose without ruffling any feathers [MN], like --
L:  So, how old are the kids that you're teaching?
R:  Um, well, they'll be ninth graders.
L:  Oh, ninth graders.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, man, I remember ninth grade [MN].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, and it's a -- and that, I think, is a particularly sensitive issue, because they haven't really gotten to where they can make their own decisions --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think, and -- and I can see how parents would [SIGH] care about what they were reading [SIGH].
L:  Mm.
R:  And I don't know what would happen -- you know, 'cause sometimes, too, teachers will assign a book and then there's, like, Huckleberry Finn, right?  You know, there's, like, a couple things in there that ob- -- people object to, and it becomes a big brouhaha --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you don't even know to -- you know, when you're reading it yourself, you don't even see that [SIGH].  So, I don't know --
L:  Because you almost forget [MN] --
R:  -- what would happen --
L:  Yeah, unless you get the viewpoint that people are coming from, you know, what they have and have not been exposed to [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  And also, a lot of them, [SIGH] um, I'm -- I'm no- -- we don't have that many in Hawaii, but I would think you might get parents who haven't really read the book --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they -- they -- they're not gonna read it because it's, uh, [MN] porn to them [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then how do you discuss it with them?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know? [LAUGH] If they haven't really read it.  I don't have -- I -- it's a difficult issue.  [SIGH] But I'd -- I think, as a teacher, right now we're so, um, [LIPSMACK] legally liable for things, 'cause there's so much stuff going on in the courts about our res- -- rights --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- our responsibilities, uh, as educators --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, I'm -- I -- I had some si- -- a situation with a math student last year, where [MN] the mother almost took me to court because [SIGH] the student was in a class that had sixteen out of the twenty three -- sixteen of them were special education students, 'cause they're trying to mainstream them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and this is a low level class [SIGH] and [MN] -- as a teacher, I could not rem- -- do remedial math --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and teach a class and have each six- -- each of the sixteen students have their own separate educational plan.
L:  Of course.
R:  But legally I'm responsible to do that.  Do you see what I'm saying?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Legally, because we have th- the special education program set up [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I have to deal with each individual special education kid.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I couldn't, 'cause of the volume [LAUGH] -- of the number -- and the mom, uh, we had -- when we had a meeting, I said -- she sa- -- I -- you know, "Your child needs some help with multiplication tables and stuff", [SIGH] but she said, "I want the kid in the class to learn the other stuff".  Well, you can't do both.  You don't have the time to do both.  But yet, legally I had to.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In other words, I had to do something that was impossible to do.
L:  Which is such a conundrum, you know, when people --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- expect you to do --
R:  So, I think of -- I'm sort of in -- I'm looking at this issue the same way.  I have to teach twenty five kids [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and yet I gotta be careful that any individual parent might take me to court.  You know, I have to really, really tread softly.  So, [SIGH] I'm -- I'm for trying to, you know, pick a book that I think is safe.  If it turns out not to be safe [SIGH], my view is I'll give that child another option.
L:  [MN]
R:  In other words, I'm not gonna -- I'm gonna pick my battles.  I'm not gonna make that one a freedom of -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- speech or whatever [SIGH] option.  But that's kind of a, you know, chicken's way out.  
L:  So, um, what books have you selected to read for next year?
R:  I haven't done any yet, because, um, I just signed my contract about a week ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I haven't even seen the textbook that they use.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it -- that will kinda dictate [SIGH].  And it could be that the textbook makes suggestions.  And if that's the case, I'll probably, you know, do -- do the suggestions that go along with any individual chapter that we're doing through the year.
L:  Now, is it more of a grammar class or more of a literature class?
R:  Uh, I don't know that either, because I haven't ever taught English before [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm -- I'm put in a situation where -- I mean, it's not like I wasn't good at it.  I was an AP English student, and I did a lotta editing in -- in my career as a systems analyst, but [SIGH] I haven't really looked at the specific curriculum --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, I don't have a problem -- I mean, I can go any -- any way.  But I'm sure that these days, the language arts programs tend to be [SIGH] very holistic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they bring in -- interdisciplinary.  They bring in social studies.  They're trying to even put math into the English curriculum so that the students recognize that they don't just go to a class --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they come out and their life is over with that class, you know, that they -- it's really part of their whole life learning experience.
L:  [MN]
R:  And because of that [SIGH] I think, uh, you -- you know, as long as you approach the standards, which are [SIGH] you need to be able to write and you need to be able to read --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and be critical, and -- and -- and do some of the things that they've always done, but they're doing them in a more activity oriented and, you know, like, interdisciplinary --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- approach.  [SIGH] So, I might even be using books -- um, I'm teaching in the same room [LIPSMACK] with another teacher who's doing US history [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we're thinking of doing some interdisciplinary things there, so it could be --
L:  What -- do you teach in the exact same room at the same time or different time?
R:  No, not at same time.
L:  Okay, I was trying to imagine.
R:  We're sharing -- right, we're sharing the room.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We're actually sharing a teaching line, and then we're doing help with special kids.  We're also sharing that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on the alternate days.  [SIGH] But we'll probably do some interdisciplinary stuff.  So, it could be that the English classes will be reading some kind of a, you know, history biography or something that both sets of classes can do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's -- that's kinda where they're headed.  And they don't put a lot of emphasis on grammar.  I don't know [MN] -- I mean, I'm a lot older, I'm fifty nine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so [SIGH] I -- when we were in school, we learned grammar as grammar, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- here's where you put the commas, and here's how you --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- conjugate the verbs, yeah.  But they don't do that any more, they do it more by -- I think more by example and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- teach sort of like, "Now we're gonna discuss putting periods at the end of sentences and we'll have today's, you know, thing.  We won't -- we won't make red marks for anything except if you don't have a period".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the next day you teach 'em one more thing, so -- but by the end they've picked it up, but not because they learned it in -- from a grammar book. 
L:  Mhm.  So, are you teaching in a public school or a private school?
R:  It's a public -- very, very public [LAUGH] school.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Our department of education is kinda like the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland, it's really strange [SIGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  So the lot of the teachers are kinda going nuts with this no child left behind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- law.  And the -- [MN] I just heard on the television the other day that in our state, um, twice as many principals as last year chose not to come back next year.  Most of them are just retiring at fifty five instead of, you know, most principals stay on much past fifty five --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and they're just bailing out, you know, because it's really --
