L:  Hi.  I'm Anna.
R:  Hi.  I'm Jennifer.  How are you today?
L:  Good.  Good, Jennifer.  How are you?
R:  Not too bad.
L:  [LAUGH] Good.  So, we're to talk about hobbies, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] The things that we --
L:  Um, [NOISE] what are your hobbies?
R:  Ah, well, that's what I was just thinking, "Do I have hobbies?" [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Yes.  Um, I think -- yeah, I think that it -- you know, everyone does.  You might not realize that they're hobbies though.  'Cause they're -- if they're just something you enjoy doing --
R:  That's --
L:  -- I think that's a hobby.
R:  And I would say then --
L:  You know?
R:  -- probably my hobbies are research 'cause I really enjoy --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- looking stuff up and finding answers to things --
L:  Oh, like, on the internet?
R:  -- um, on the internet, um --
L:  Is that how you ...?
R:  If you could see the --
L:  A- --
R:  -- library of books I own. [LAUGH] [NOISE] I am -- I'm a book --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- junkie.  I'm an information junkie. [LAUGH]
L:  That --
R:  And what do you do?
L:  Mm.  That's great.  Um, [LIPSMACK] my hobbies, let's see ... I don't -- I mean, I have daily ho- -- like, I l- -- I love to read too, you know, that's something I do every day and I like to watch movies and cook.  But things that I -- hobbies that I feel that -- like, I don't get to do every day but I would love to be able to but I just don't -- like, I love to dance --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I go running.  Um, so those are, sort of -- and I'm always looking to, kinda, get new hobbies.  I wanna learn how to knit really badly. [LAUGH] That's something I wanna do -- I want to become a hobby.  So, it's, kinda, j- -- I guess there's different levels of hobbies or ...  I'm not exactly sure but ...  But --
R:  Ah, I do [LAUGH] --
L:  -- I guess one of the questions was do you think that --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- everyone should --
R:  I think everybody --
L:  -- have one?
R:  -- needs one thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to distract 'em from everyday [MN] --
L:  Yeah.  I do too.
R:  -- stuff, you know? [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Right.  Right.  From work and from stress.  Yes.  I -- I definitely think everybody needs one.  And I guess ... trying to think ... I guess -- well, I work, you know, eight to five so I guess I spend -- I spend the morning before work and the evenings after work doing --
R:  Uh-huh.  I'm a full time college student and a mom of three. [LAUGH]
L:  -- my hobbies I guess. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Then I do get time though.
L:  Oh --
R:  Um, I probably --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- spend three --
L:  So, you definitely [LAUGH] don't --
R:  -- hours a day --
L:  -- have much time.
R:  -- on the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- internet doing research.  So -- of course, a lot of it is [NOISE] school related. [LAUGH]
L:  Three hours a day?
R:  Ah, a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of it is.
L:  What kind of thing- -- what -- m- --
R:  I'm in a nursing student --
L:  I- it is school related --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- is that what you said?
R:  -- like, right now --
L:  A lot of it is.  What kind of things are you researching --
R:  -- I'm doing -- I have a research paper --
L:  -- right now?
R:  -- due on, um, Hepatitis C.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  But -- but then I started looking at all the different kinds of treatments, which we didn't have to look at that and that was really interesting and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- then I started looking into genetic [inaudible], which is part of the research treatment they do and that's really, really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- interesting. [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
L:  Wow.  Wow.  Yes.  It's actually -- when you're researching on the internet I feel that you just, like, go links and, you know, you just learn about other things when you're trying to get to one thing and you end up finding out so much more than you, kind of, set out to find out about.
R:  I -- I don't think you really do that so much, um, I found in libraries and things like that.  You don't tend to do that 'cause there's not [NOISE] such cross referencing.  But on the internet you find that a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- more.  You know?
L:  Right. [PAUSE] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Unfortunately. [PAUSE]
L:  Mhm.  Could just spend hours and hours and hours on it. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  My favorite thing to do on the internet is to shop.
R:  That is so much fun.  Especially --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when you find that bar- --
L:  I love to --
R:  -- amazing bargain.
L:  -- find the best prices on things and then buy 'em. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Mhm.  I know.  I've tried not to get too into eBay but --
R:  I've been there and My Simon dom isn't half bad either.
L:  -- I think probably could but I don't let myself.  But I mostly [LIPSMACK] -- like, Half dot com -- do you ever go to that for books?
R:  Um, well, actually it just, kinda, goes through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the web and looks for the lowest price on any item you ask it for.
L:  Oh, My Simon dot com?  Never been to that one.
R:  It, kinda --
L:  Is that for books too?
R:  -- does the research for you in that aspect. [PAUSE] Uh-huh.
L:  Oh. [PAUSE]
R:  I'm --
L:  Oh, cool.  There's also Froogle dot com, which is part of Google --
R:  I like looking at stuff.  A lot of the stuff I research though -- I mean, I research everything.  Um --
L:  -- but it's Froogle and they do that -- that, kinda, thing too.
R:  Medical stuff is interesting for me --
L:  Oh, that's awesome.
R:  -- because I'm a nursing student.  Um, I have been -- oh, that's another -- I have another hobby I guess I have to admit --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I've been a professional tarot reader for the last nine years.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- anything -- anything that deals with that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, I'm always interested 'cause I'm in the process of writing a book on how to --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- read tarot cards.
L:  That is definitely cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Whoa. [PAUSE] Okay.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  I just got exci- -- I guess I just don't think about it.  I'm so -- I spend so much time busy running --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- from one thing to the next.
L:  So, r- --
R:  'Cause my youngest just --
L:  So, writing too is a -- could be considered another hobby.
R:  -- turned three weeks old yesterday.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] And my oldest is eight so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I get so busy sometimes I forget I do things. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, my god.  You have, l- like, a newborn baby in the house.
R:  Well, right now all my classes are -- I have this --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and this semester it's all set up to be all over the internet.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know.
R:  So, I can do all my schoolwork from home --
L:  What do you -- what does the little baby do when you're at school?
R:  -- and I don't have to leave baby with babysitter. [PAUSE] It's a he.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh-huh.  Little boy.
L:  Okay.  That's great. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Right.  Oh, that's good.  'Cause she's -- oh, is it a he or a she -- the little one?
R:  Um, the middle one is three.
L:  He? [NOISE] He -- he's so l- -- young.  Oh, congratulations though.  That's really cool.
R:  I'm going to school full time, I'm --
L:  And how old's the middle one?
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a stay at home as much as I can.
L:  Oh, and she's -- so, three weeks --
R:  And, um --
L:  -- three and eight?
R:  -- I used to do professional tarot readings.
L:  Oh, wow.  And you're doing school full time?
R:  I used to counsel a lot over the phone.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  It's -- you know, you can do all that over the phone -- I don't know if you knew that. [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Um [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE] --
L:  You can do tarot reading over the phone? [NOISE]
R:  Mm.  [NOISE] A lotta times --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you don't even need to do that.
L:  So, you --
R:  Um --
L:  How does it work then?  It's just what you --
R:  It just depends.  I've been, um --
L:  I know it's probably really, really in depth but, like, you just -- just from what someone tells you about themselves you can --
R:  One of the favorite things I used to do, um, I have a website that I've done a lotta stuff through -- no, I'm not plugging myself here -- and [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- but, um, when I would get people that -- I gotta lotta people who were, like, "Well, you just tell me what you can get about me" and you can lay out a card spread in such a way that it can tell you --
L:  No, no, no. [LAUGH] H- -- that's fine. [LAUGH]
R:  -- things about them in certain time frames in their past [NOISE] and then you can work forward.  And a lotta times we'd go through a person's past and tell them what you see, it will get them -- first of all, nine times out of ten, you can nail it on the head a- and with a good set of cards once you're comfortable with them.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's just learning to work with them.  It's not any different than --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Um, it's not hard either.  I've taught classes for the last three years on how to do this.  It's not that hard.  You can learn all of them --
L:  Whoa.
R:  -- on a visual key system.  So, when you look at [NOISE] the card, look at -- you know, you -- you in on, like, a specific aspect of the card that reminds you what the card means.  I taught --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a group of four women and one young man.  Um, the oldest --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the youngest person in my class --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seventeen, the oldest --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was fifty five [NOISE] and I taught them how to read a whole deck and be able to do seven different spreads within four weeks.  They had class once a week. [NOISE] And we met four hours.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  Four hours, once a week.  So, in sixteen hours you can conceive a [inaudible] on the entire deck --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of cards, what they mean and how to interpret them together.
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] And there are seventy six cards in a deck.
L:  Four hours, once a week?  Four -- or one hour once a week? [PAUSE]
R:  It's fun.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] A- -- um --
L:  Wow.
R:  Most of 'em wanted to learn it for fun.  I taught them how to set up their own website --
L:  Oh, my god.  That's really interesting.
R:  -- to, um, use it.  I sent them out each a research --
L:  That's a- --
R:  -- sh- -- [inaudible] it up --
L:  And then do these people who you taught, did they go on to --
R:  -- how to set up your own website, where to, um --
L:  -- do they have a business now or --
R:  -- market yourself through -- how to market yourself --
L:  -- or did they just wanna learn it for fun to show their friends?
R:  -- if you wanna work local, where to do that.  Recommended that they don't do it from their own home 'cause that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a bad idea 'cause you [NOISE] never know what, kinda, flaker[?] [NOISE] you might attract.  And, so, you know, taught them how to do it safely.  And, um, it's actually a lot of fun. [LAUGH] Um, I had [NOISE] -- what were you g- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh. [PAUSE]
L:  Right.
R:  I know anyone can do it. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, it's not like you have to have -- some people are better at it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than others.  But it's, like I've said to people before, anyone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- can play the piano.
L:  I bet it -- I bet it is.
R:  Not everyone is a great piano player. [LAUGH]
L:  M- -- and you think that anyone can do it or is it --
R:  And some people can practice forever and never --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get any better.
L:  Do you have to b- -- [NOISE]
R:  And it just depends on your interest.
L:  Okay. [PAUSE] Mhm.
R:  I guess it som- --
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.  I- -- [PAUSE] Right.  That's cool. [PAUSE] That is really neat.  So, that's a huge hobby then of yours.  I mean, that's something that you really, really like to do. [NOISE] Probably --
