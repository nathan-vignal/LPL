L:  Hi.  My name is Kim.
R:  Hi Kim.  My name is Rose.
L:  Oh, god, I finally get to talk to a live person.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.  They will t- --
L:  They always call me and I was, like -- nobody's ever on the line so --
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  But, ah --
L:  Let me guess, you're har- -- your -- your hobby is gardening?
R:  No, actually it isn't. [LAUGH]
L:  O- okay.  What is it?
R:  I -- I live in Florida -- it's too hot and humid here to garden. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  I live in Georgia so I know.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Who wants to garden?  I actually -- you know what?  I don't really have any hobbies.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  I don't.  Yeah.  I don't.
L:  There's, like, nothing you do just for you, just for enjoyment, like, quilting or --
R:  No.  I --
L:  -- watching movies or travel or cooking or --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- reading?
R:  I -- I like to read and I like to travel but, you know, as I've gotten older i- i- -- I tend to read less because my eyes are [LAUGH] st- -- kinda, hard to focus and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- probably I don't travel as much anymore because my husband passed away so it's -- you know, it's not as much fun --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- going by yourself.  So -- you know?
L:  What about bowling or something like that?
R:  No.  Don't like that.
L:  Well, you know what?
R:  No.
L:  Well, you need -- you need a hobby. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Ah, w- --
L:  If your -- I mean, if your husband passed and you're by yourself, get a hobby 'cause that's the best way to meet, like, new people.
R:  Oh, please.  That was my --
L:  No, I'm saying dating --
R:  No --
L:  -- I'm talking about just people that are friends that you can --
R:  Well, I still work.
L:  -- talk to and stuff.  It's not that you don't have kids -- friends --
R:  No.
L:  -- it's just -- it's a good way to meet new people.
R:  Yeah.  I still work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm active in church.  I mean, I do volunteer --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- work but --
L:  So, you -- you, kinda --
R:  But, yeah.  I mean --
L:  -- maxed out.  You don't have time for a hobby.
R:  I don't have time.  I -- you know what?  I used to do ceramics when -- when my children were small --
L:  Na- -- that was a good one -- I did that one too.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and, you know, I didn't work, I was a stay at home mom for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- many years and I thought --
L:  I did that too.  Well, I'm doing that now. [LAUGH]
R:  Th- that's great, you know?  A- and I enjoy doing that but as far as now, I didn't have time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I really don't.  You know, I -- I think it is -- I think it's important especially for men --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to have hobbies and -- and the reason I think it's important for men is because they identify themselves with their job.
L:  Right.
R:  That's who they are.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  My honey does that a lot but --
R:  M- --
L:  -- he's working on it.  I mean, he's doing the church thing and all that but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- let's see, he has a hobby ... well, he has a few of 'em but [LAUGH] the ones I can talk about are, like, fishing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  Well, that's his hobby. [NOISE]
R:  I -- I enjoyed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fishing for years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, my husband went.  It was my second husband that would go fishing -- he died too. [LAUGH] So, it was, like [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, no.  Two of 'em died on you?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  In ten years.
L:  That's harsh.
R:  Within ten years.
L:  How old are you?
R:  Well, I -- I'm fifty nine but my --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- husband that --
L:  That's a good age.
R:  -- died -- yeah.  He died l- -- a year ago in October was fifty four and the one that died before him was fifty six so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- one was older than me, one was younger than me so, you know --
L:  You're outliving 'em any way.
R:  I'm telling you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I --
L:  So, with work and -- what do you do for work?
R:  I -- well, I work for a insurance company.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  But --
L:  And you don't think you -- like, you need a hobby to take your mind off of that?  Like, what do you do just to, like, unwind?
R:  Mm ... [LIPSMACK] I would say read or go play with my grandchildren.
L:  Yeah, well, I don't --
R:  I've got six of them e- --
L:  -- think grandchildren are a hobby but I think --
R:  Well, yeah.  But --
L:  -- reading is probably your hobby.
R:  Yeah.  Probably the -- you know, I'm getting -- I work at a call center [inaudible] so I'm on a phone all day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I did --
L:  A call center? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  For --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- insurance.  I talk to, um, doctors and the claims that they do.  I --
L:  A- -- oh, yeah.
R:  -- speak to providers all day long --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with claims that they have.
L:  You need a hobby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sounds like a lotta dry, dusty stuff.
R:  Well, it -- it can be but a- -- then again, you know, um --
L:  My --
R:  I did work for the county --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I live in California -- I worked out there in computer operations and I loved it but my children were on the East Coast and so I retired at fifty five and moved to the East Coast.
L:  What city were you in --
R:  N- --
L:  -- in California?
R:  I was in San Bernardino.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I had my oldest child at, um, Monterey --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  -- and that was, like, my last duty station that I was in before I got out of the military.
R:  Oh, very good.  And how long were you in?
L:  Three years.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- --
L:  Long enough to go to exotic places, not kill anybody, get pregnant and come home. [NOISE]
R:  That works.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] My oldest daughter was in the air force and my husband --
L:  My honey was in the air force and my daddy, who --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- passed away about eight years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my real dad, he was a twenty year dude.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the one that died in ninety three -- my husband was a thirty year.  So, you know -- mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  But --
L:  So, you've seen --
R:  -- a- --
L:  -- everything?
R:  Yeah.  I loved it.  I traveled all over -- went to Europe.  I mean, I really did enjoy it and, um ...  So, there's a lotta things that, y- you know --
L:  I didn't get to do the Europe thing.  I got to do the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Korea thing. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  I --
L:  And that --
R:  I didn't --
L:  That was a lotta fun.
R:  And actually, my daughter's -- her hu- -- I have a set of twins now and one of the daughters that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was married to a navy guy and he was stationed in Paris at the American Embassy.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  So, after my --
L:  Sweet.
R:  -- husband died --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I went back to Europe again for six weeks to visit with them and -- you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You lucky duck.
R:  Yeah.  So, I really -- I mean, I've had a lot of things to do and sitting around and knitting just -- I don't have time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] You know what I mean?
L:  Sitting around and knitting -- you don't have time.
R:  I don't have time, [LAUGH] you know? [LAUGH]
L:  There are some of us that would, like, kill to know how to knit but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I haven't made it there yet.
R:  Not me.
L:  Think I'll wait to I'm, like, fifty something and then take it up.
R:  Yeah.  Well, by that time your eyes get bad so [LAUGH] -- you know?  And your mind goes so you don't remember --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you knit one pearl so -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  What do you mean goes?  Ah, mine's gone.  What are you talking about?
R:  Mine's gone. [LAUGH]
L:  I have k- -- I have a kid so -- I have, like, a teenager.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  My mind is mostly gone [LAUGH] already.
R:  You just have one teenager?
L:  Well, yeah, because I'm only thirty eight -- she's sixteen.
R:  Oh, that's not too bad then.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, no.  She's g- -- I mean, my kids are great.  I have the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- most awesome children in the world but it's, like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, you're saying your mind goes and I'm, like, "What are you talking about?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I had four teenagers all at the same time.
L:  Oh, no.  You're a brave girl.  I could not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do that.
R:  I just -- well, no, I just -- I had a daughter and then she -- when she was eighteen months old I had a set of twins and, you know, it's, like --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, before you know it they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all teenagers and you think, "Why am I still on this planet?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And ha- --
R:  So, do you ha- --
L:  -- have you done these surveys a long time?
R:  No.  Actual- --
L:  Have you ever gotten paid for [NOISE] 'em?
R:  No, actually I haven't.  One of the women at church gave me this and said I -- something about having three calls --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something like this and this is the third --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- call I've gotten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so ...
L:  But have you ever been paid for 'em?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, well, they do pay you for them.
R:  Well, I know they do.
L:  Mm.
R:  I -- I know.  I just haven't gotten paid. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I've been doing, like --
L:  'Cause I don't know how long it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- takes to pay but --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think this is, like, the second or third week I've been, you know, getting called so --
L:  Well, I've been getting calls for, probably, about a month but you're the first live body I've ever seen, like -- been able to talk to.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, that's --
R:  I- --
L:  -- kinda, cool because it's, like, "Man, it's about time".
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I've talked -- every, like, time I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talked to another person.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you have hobbies?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, do you do --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  What do you do for a hobby?
L:  I have -- come on puppy. [MN] My newest hobby is, like, a four and a half month old pup.
R:  Oh.
L:  M- -- come on.
R:  That would be fun.
L:  [MN]
R:  That would be fun.
L:  Oh, yeah.  She wandered up in the yard, her and her mom and they were not in good shape.
R:  Mm.
L:  But the pup was in real bad shape.  But no -- I have hobbies.  I -- I read, I, ah -- the web is, like, my worst hobby of all [NOISE] -- the internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I shop -- to me, that's a hobby. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I shop too.  Oh, and I do work out every day.
L:  Oh, see, you work out.
R:  See --
L:  I don't work --
R:  Well -- but --
L:  My work out is, like, you know, twelve ounce curls. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Straight a- a- -- glasses of ice tea. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No beer. [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  No, I -- well, I -- I just -- I got --
L:  So, I collect dolls too.
R:  -- going on a treadmill 'cause it -- it really helped a lot with stress, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I really -- so I work out every day for, like, an hour, you know?
L:  You go girl.
R:  And I was -- and I was just thinking, "You know, I should start getting -- start using weights and I could be a body builder".  My kids think you're -- you're losing it Mom.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You're losing it. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I collect dolls and, um, listen to music -- that's a -- like, a big thing for me.  I like music.
R:  C- -- no --
L:  I gotta have, like, music with everything.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I usually have my radio on all the time, you know?
L:  I watch movies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love videos.
R:  I don't watch TV.  I'm -- fact matter, I --
L:  TV I don't do unless it's, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Survivor or -- or Jeopardy.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I --
L:  Or something on PBS.
R:  Mm.  I don't even do that.
L:  But this is, kinda, cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm, ah -- I'm glad one finally went through 'cause I was, like, "Well, wait a minute, you know?  When is it gonna get this done the right way?"
R:  I don't know.  I've just e- -- w- what did I talk about with ...?  About eating out opposed to eating in or fast food and stuff like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then our hobbies and, ah --
L:  Oh, I would love --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would love to do that one.  As a matter fact --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what was really funny, when they called me on that one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was headed out the door to go out to dinner. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I like to eat out because it's -- it's convenient, you know?
L:  Yeah.  But there's only one of you, it's just a pain in the butt to cook.
R:  Yeah.  It really is.
L:  Well --
R:  You know?
L:  -- me and the old man, when -- when the kids go to my moms for the weekends, we get --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, um ... [PAUSE]
R:  Well, it's -- if you need a break, you know, I --
L:  We get to the -- no, we just get --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- like, "Oh, the heck with it -- we're going out to dinner".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we do that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  It's just great.
L:  But ...  This is funny -- I wonder if they take these calls and they go, "Okay, we get s- -- people started talking about hobbies and see what else they'll talk about".
R:  I don't know but it seems awfully hard to talk about just hobbies when -- especially when, I don't think -- you know, it's my life --
L:  Well, if you don't have any --
R:  I- --
L:  I mean, like, I collect dolls -- oh, yeah, I collect foreign money when I come across money, you know, from different countries --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Mm.
L:  -- um, collect those.  I collect foreign pen pals too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have [LAUGH] one from Pakistan, one from India, one from --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- Burkina Faso, um --
R:  How do you keep up with all of 'em? [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon me?
R:  How do you keep up with all of them?
L:  Oh, we email.  We email and we I.M. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have, um [NOISE] -- okay, what beetle? [NOISE] Well, he's gone now.  I, um -- ah, these are generally -- two are people I've met, like, on the web.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'll have Yahoo Messenger open and these people I.M. me and we just start up a chat.  Um, I have this one friend and we're, like, really -- you know, we're really tight.  I mean, he just went over to Canada from Pakistan and I missed him because I couldn't get up to Canada then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm sure if he decides to emigrate, I'll get to meet him and his lovely wife and their two darling daughters.
R:  Well, that'd be great.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] we don't, um --
R:  M- --
L:  My f- --
