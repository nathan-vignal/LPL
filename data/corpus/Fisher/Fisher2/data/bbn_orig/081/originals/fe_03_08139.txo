L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name's Kathy.
L:  Hi.  I'm Richard.  
R:  Hi, Richard.
L:  Where -- where are you calling from, Kathy?
R:  Illinois.
L:  [inaudible] I'm, uh, side of LA.
R:  Oh, right[?].
L:  Yeah, so it's about what?  Ten o'clock over there?
R:  Yes.  It's about five 'til ten here.  We have fire works going off and nine thirty every -- every town around me [inaudible] fire works. So  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It must be nice.  W- We haven't started here.  It's still light here.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Uh, what was the question of [NOISE] the day because she was [NOISE], um, fading[?] in and out when I heard her.
L:  It was breaking up real bad.  I think it said -- the last time I heard was, um, "In the case of a terrorist attack w- would you panic, or would you remain calm?
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Wow.  I -- you know, I -- it caught me by surprise.  Uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The last two times I talked it was a easier -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- easier topic.  Um --
R:  I think --
L:  I would, um -- I remember Nine Eleven vividly like it was last week.
R:  Okay.
L:  'Cause, um, it was -- it was very early in the morning here.  It was only like five o'clock -- morning and I don't [inaudible] why I was at a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- coffee shop and I looked up and there was TVs on throughout the coffee shop and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I looked and I said, "You know, that looks like, um -- it looks as though it was happening, um, in back in the three I think when -- when they tried to bomb those trade towers".  "But this one", I -- I said, "It looks even worse" and somebody's sitting there at the -- at the [inaudible] and said, "No.  This is live.  This is real and this -- this is today, you know, it's just happening now".  I could not believe it.  The first thought I had was, um, that it was a -- a terrorist attack.  And then when the second --
R:  Mm.
L:  And the second, uh, plane hit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then I was for sure, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We were under attack and I used to be in the Army when I was young.  I'm forty seven now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I -- I went straight into recruit[?] and I said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  " [inaudible] America's under attack and can I -- can I rejoin because our country is being attacked", and -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They said, "Well, you're -- you're just past the limit.  You -- you -- you can join until you're forty five and -- but do you know anybody else that would ?"  And so I went and called my friend and, um, took him over to the Recruiting Station.  Well, I don't know if any of 'em joined --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or not but, uh, that's the way I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- reacted I remember.
R:  Oh.
L:  I was -- I was -- I was -- I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so -- I was so -- I was like in shock, you know.  I just could not believe what had happened.  I -- I started to go to sleep at that -- that night and I could see those people jumping out the window, you know.
R:  Yes.
L:  And then after a while a couple of days went [several inaudible words] and I could actually hear those people saying, you know, the men were like, um, "My wife, you know, forgive me.  I don't wanna burn[?] like this.  I'd rather die quickly.  Please take care of the kids".  You know.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I would -- I would hear the women saying, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "Take care of -- take care of the babies for me", you know.  Like I was getting[?] madder --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and madder and madder.  So, I guess -- I guess my answer to that question would be in, uh, kind of a state of panic and shock.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A- anger and all those emotions I remember on September eleventh and the twelfth and the days following.  I just -- I just could not believe what was[?] happening.
R:  Definitely. [NOISE] I think I was in the same, um, boat that you were in. [NOISE] I was in a state of shock.  I was, um, [NOISE] had the TV in the kitchen on as I was making my daughter's breakfast before she went to school and, um, it flashed on saying that the first airplane went[?] through, you know, from the Tower and then they go, "Oh, my god, here comes another one", you know.  And then I knew we were under attack and, um, my first thing was the safety of my family came [inaudible] and I was, um, [inaudible] my daughter go to school or should I not?  You know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And that was my first response and I waited until we had more information about what was going on.  You know.
L:  So, you're a -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You're a -- you're a good mother like most mothers are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The first thing you think about are the kids[?].  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, um, I didn't --
L:  Yeah.  I [inaudible] nowadays now because we've gone through this and we have that terror alert thing on CNN and all the channels that tells you, you know, how worried --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we should be, I guess.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess I'm kind of, um, a little bit more a- aware and a little bit less, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  If it happened again, this time I guess I would expect more and I would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in less   I would still be as angry and that but I would be in less shock I think and I don't -- I don't know if I would panic as much as I did last time.  I think I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- would be more calm.  I'd call up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody to see where -- where I should be, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where I could [several inaudible words] the most and that's -- that's all I would do.
R:  And I -- I think -- and I think you're right.  I think a lot of us after we found out what's going on, our [inaudible] response is, "How can we help out?"  "Who can we help with?"  You know.  And, um, [several inaudible words] that was, um, my situation was, um, "How can we best help out?"  Whether it be financially, whether it be sending, you know, um, you know, food or -- or, you know, whatever they needed to that area.  You know.  So, um, I know --
L:  Yeah, my first -- my first response back then was even though I have Mexican heritage and all that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Still -- I still born -- born here and I feel more American than anything else [inaudible].  My first response was, "I will go to the border to make sure that we were not[?] attacked from the south and the people towards the north they could protect us from north and, you know, and the people on the [inaudible] coast protect there and the people on the east coast.  The people central[?] would be the ones that would [NOISE] facilitate all the -- that's the first thing I says is that we would make a -- like a big, big perimeter.
R:  Correct.
L:  So that nobody else could come in and so I guess that's what I w- -- I would still to this day unless -- unless we were getting instructions over the TV or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what -- that would be my thought I guess.  I -- I -- I don't know if I would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- panic.  I hope I wouldn't.
R:  Yeah.  I think our country is more, uh, set up for if there was a terrorist attack again.  What to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think nine one one was a wake up call.
L:  Yes, it w- --
R:  'Cause we were too relaxed and, uh --
L:  Well, the reason that we'd all go overseas to fight was so they would never come to our -- to our land, you know.
R:  To our sh- shores.  Yes.
L:  Yeah, and then it happened and then we -- I just cannot believe that somebody would come to our country[?], you know, to attack us here.  So, I -- first I didn't believe it and then now I do believe it 'cause it happened and so now we have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We just have to live like the rest of the world lives, you know, that a attack could happen at any time.
R:  Correct.  And I think I agree with you on that, um, uh, fact[?].  I first was in denial that this was actually[?] happening.  You know, you hear about the old video[?] stations where they're saying we're invaded by the martians or whatever and people believed this, you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And -- or -- or whatever, you know, the -- the radio and they know what was real and was wasn't and I thi- -- this isn't happening.  This is a joke.  You know, and I was waiting[?] for the joke to be over with.  Then we're[?] seeing this is real and people are really hurt.  We are serious trouble.  I was thinking, "I like in the [inaudible] area.  What is going to happen to Chicago[?]?"  And places were evacuated immediately.  The s- -- the, you know, tall storey buildings, you know.  There was a runway that we had in -- in -- a small runway for small pilot jets [inaudible].  They tore up that runway.  You know, so Chicago could not be attacked, you know, from that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- way.
L:  And the [inaudible] are even higher than the --
R:  Correct.
L:  -- Twin Towers I believe[?].  Yeah, so that would've probably been, uh, Mister Bin Laden's, uh, next, uh, target.  He would've had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the planes, you know.
R:  A- and I think the next phase I went through was grieving phase with all the parents, um, of children and -- and the wives that came on -- on the television, you know, that, you know, said their -- their husband was in, you know, an airplane and -- and they were -- they were killed and all this kind of thing.  I think that was the next state that I was in; a grieving state.  And then the next [inaudible] I went through was, um, how can I handle this?  How could I cope with this?  What can I do with -- with the resources I have to help out, you know.
L:  Yeah, I sent a -- I sent the little bit that I had in the bank, um, [inaudible] you know that fund and then  But that didn't feel like enough.  It didn't feel like I was doing enough so -- so I just started, um -- we had a memorial service at the church and -- and we would talk --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- about it and all that stuff and, you know, to this day we still pray for those -- for those people and those families, especially those brave ones that -- that caused the -- that fourth plane go down before it went -- before it got to the White House.  It was supposed to go to the White House.
R:  Correct.
L:  And they -- so they're -- they're like, uh, heroes for me, you know, those people that caused --
R:  Definitely.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Weren't they just great?  I mean, these guys --
L:  Yeah.  They [several inaudible words].
R:  -- that gave their lives though to --
L:  'Cause --
R:  -- save, you know, the White House.
L:  The President and all those people.  Yeah, yeah.  So --
R:  I mean[?], how brave of them.
L:  They knew they were gonna die and they still did it, you know.
