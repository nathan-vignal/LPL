R:  Hi, my name's Heather.
L:  I'm Laura.
R:  This is the first time I ever did this, so [LAUGH] um, I really have no um problem with divorce rates.  Me and my husband, we have a stable relationship and I think of a lot of the people having problems, but that shouldn't do individually, you know, we should make a point and not worry about other people's problems not --
L:  Yeah.  I agree --
R:  -- you know, worry about ourself and take care of home, then we can take care of other people.
L:  I agree.  I'm not divorced, I'm a widow and um I have a sister and a brother that are both divorced and, you know, it's -- sometimes marriages just don't work.
R:  [SIGH] I --
L:  And -- 
R:  -- I know that because I got a couple that right now my brother in law, he's in the ah process of getting divorce --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and a lot of people just don't want to put forth the effort, they -- when they get married, they don't realize what they're getting into --
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  -- they should realize what they're getting into and be responsible and take, you know, charge and a lot of people just -- they can't [SIGH] oh be in love and that's it, that's all it takes [LAUGH] -- and it takes a lot more --
L:  And I think a lot --
R:  -- it's a responsibility and being willing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to stick by each other and realize, you know, there's going to be some up and downs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that there's some ultimate, you know, lines you don't cross with each other and make sure you state that before you even get married, hey, you don't do this because if you do this, you're crossing that line.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what I told my husband, because I saw a lot of people get divorced and I told my husband, I was like, "You cheat on me, it's over" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's like, you have that option.  So, if one person ain't enough for you then, you know, that's it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I think a lot of people get married and think they can change the other person --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you can't.  The only way a person can change is if they want to change.  You can't make a person change and I think that's what happened with my sister because she's a cop --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she married this guy.  We told her, you know, "He's doing drugs, he's drinking, you don't need to be around him" and she thought, "Oh, he'll change when we get married" and you just can't change somebody like that.
R:  No.  You sure can't.  Ah --
L:  Mm.
R:  I see so much that I hm me and my husband we got married later, we didn't, you know, rush and everything he was o- he was pushing thirty, his dad laughed, he was like, "You going to be like me, boy" [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I mean, but it's like I'm glad we waited, we didn't rush into it and everything, we made sure we knew what we were getting into first.
L:  Yeah.  And I think that's another thing people ah get me -- you can get married in a couple of months and that's just not long enough to know a person.
R:  Not at all.  I told my sister the same thing because her, she's like first night she meets a guy she's in love with him, "Oh, we're going to get married" I'm like, "Holly, you don't know anything about this person enough" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But most people they just want to right away find somebody and it's like, you know, after the first thing when that first argument comes along, "Oh, he didn't do this or he didn't do that right" [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like, "Okay, it's over" and it's like, "Well, it's not so easy" --
L:  Yeah.  No.  And to spend your life with someone, you have to know that person because, you know, things happen and you have to be able to trust somebody and you can't develop trust in a couple of weeks.
R:  No.  Especially not, ah, today, the way diseases are going around and everything like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- our priest has um [several inaudible words] all the time and it's like, look, don't be in a rush, go to college, enjoy your life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, trust me, you make the wrong move and everything and rush too fast, your life might be over with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's like a lot [LAUGH] a lot of people it's like they don't get the chance to enjoy their marriage because they screwed it up too bad from the beg ah get go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah.
L:  And, you know, I've always heard that the first two years, or the first five years, or whatever, are the hardest and a lot of people don't even get through that, don't stick with it to get through it to get to the really good part --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, they get married and all they want to do is have sex and stuff at first, but there's more to marriage than sex.
R:  Yeah, that's -- there's a lot of time for -- and I tell my sister the same thing, I told her that she's a -- I told her she's -- I don't know it's a nice word to put it for her, I told her she's got to think a lot more than just in her pants, she's gotta think, you know, hey, is this the guy I love?  What if something happens to him?  What if he gets crippled?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- the only thing I could do with him is actually hold his hand.  Can you spend the rest of your life, because that's what you're going to be giving is the rest of your life with this person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I said you gotta be willing to do that and it's like that's just a g- that's a gift you got to share among each other, but one day, you know, the gift might have to run out, not choosing to, but things happen.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, things happen.  That's what my husband, we'd only been married a year and a half and he got cancer and it was like, you know, I married for better or worse, I was going to be there and I didn't want him to get cancer but, you know, he didn't want to get cancer either and I was there for him and if it had been the other way around, he would have been there for me.
R:  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Because I know how that is because I had a couple of people that died with cancer in our family and it's rough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm glad he had somebody by him --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because that's the worse -- that's when you really need somebody, that's what it's all about, marriage, is, you know, having somebody there when you need them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's like because that's what I think of my husband, as my best friend --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's like he's more important to worry, if I need a shoulder to cry on, or if he needs a shoulder to cry on or, you know, if I need a helping hand, I'm not scared to ask if I need it.
L:  Yeah.  That's like right now my Mom and Dad have been married for fifty four years and my Mom just had open heart surgery and that's really, you know, it's gotta be hard for him when, you know, they've been together forever, they've been together longer than I've been alive.
R:  Who?
L:  My mom and dad.
R:  Yeah, I know, I s- --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I said who, I know that's got to be really hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I could --
L:  Like I mean it was hard --
R:  -- I -- sometimes I just wake up and dream like, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if we're crying and I'm like -- he's like, "I'm right here", I'm like, "I know, I just had a bad dream and it's like -- it -- what I had to do without you, if you wasn't here".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I got so spoiled for him being around --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I just --
L:  Because I can't -- I can't imagine how my Dad or my Mom, either one, would do without the other one, because they've always been there.  And, you know, most of the time people anymore aren't married for fifty or sixty years because there's so much divorce because they don't, I don't know --
R:  Well, I know because we laughed, actually, because um the one I sent, ah, he don't want to get divorced but he -- his wife, he has no choice, she laughed -- they've only been together for a year and she's like, "Well, what did you expect?" she's like, "Did you expect us to stay married like your mom and dad stayed married all these years?" and he's like, "Yes" --
L:  Yeah, that's why we got married.
R:  -- and she's like, "Well, I'm having fun here and I met some new people, I don't want" because they're both in the service --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she just got um released and he's staying and he was getting a house for them as a surprise for her and everything and he's like, "I got a house for you, to surprise you, this way we can finally be together and you're telling me you're happy and you want to stay in North Carolina, you don't want to come with me?" and she's like, "No, I -- I'm having fun here, [several inaudible words] away and everything.  What, you thought we'd stay married forever?" he's like, "Yes" [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  That's why we got married.
R:  -- and it's like, that's what really people think nowadays, a lot of kid -- they actually, "Oh, well, my parents got divorced" it's like a, you know, you get married for a little while and then if you meet somebody new, you move on.  And it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this ain't high school.
L:  I think -- I know.  It's like --
R:  And we laugh because we really thought, it's like, you're jo- I'm a -- I thought he was joking when he said -- he's like, "I'm serious, she said that".  I'm like, "You j-" I was like, "No way".  And I was like, I couldn't believe that.  And Francis, my husband, he's like, "Yeah", he's like, "I hear that all the time" because he's a manager and he's like, "I hear kids like that all the time" and he's like, "I'm always preaching to 'em, you know, marriage is not like that, you're taking a, you know, a oath in front of God, you know, promising to be with each other" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's like that oath shouldn't be broken lightly.  And it's like most people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they don't -- they just don't have, you know, the discipline and the honor to understand what a oath means.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, nothing is important to 'em anymore.
L:  Yeah.  They think nothing's forever, but marriage is meant to be forever.
R:  [NOISE] But [NOISE] --
L:  How many k- --
R:  -- it's really, you know, I -- I know it's bad to say that you shouldn't really worry about other people's problems, but that's what a lot of people I -- it's like a soap opera with my sister and everything, she's worried about all her little girlfriends and it's like, "You've got to worry about yourself first" --
L:  Yeah.  Because then --
R:  -- before you can take care of anybody else, because if you -- if you bring in all your little friends' problems and everything, you will push away the most important side of it, is your relationship that you should be having right now and attending to that and making sure it's strong, this away, when hard times come, you've got that bridge, you know --
L:  Yeah.  And those little friends aren't going to be there --
R:  No.
L:  -- when you need 'em --
R:  Not at all.
L:  -- n- 
R:  [NOISE] Not one bit but sh- that -- they don't want to listen nowadays, kids --
L:  No.
R:  -- they don't want to listen, they know it all [LAUGH].
L:  They think -- yeah.
R:  And it's like, then they call crying, saying, "Oh, the -- oh, we broke up, we're not together and everything" and it's like, "Well, you know, I hate to say it, but I told you so".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's like, oh, that's the dreaded words they hate to hear, but it's like, "You wouldn't have to have heard it if you would have listened in the first place" --
L:  Exactly.
R:  People really, you know, they just don't take the bonds of marriage seriously --
L:  No.
R:  -- and -- and it's like I told my husband, I said, "I hate to say it, but I feel a lot", I say, "I'm glad in the way I did see it before I didn't"
