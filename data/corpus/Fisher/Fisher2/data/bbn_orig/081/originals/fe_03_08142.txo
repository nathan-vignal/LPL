R:  Gary Miller.
L:  Hi, Gary.  This is Jean Augustine calling.  I --
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  I can't hear you very well.  Can you talk -- speak up a little bit?
R:  Okay.  How's that?
L:  That's a little better.  Um, well, the topic is, uh, unannounced drug testing by companies.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I -- I think it definitely is an invasion of your privacy.  Um, I think that unless a person is, uh, not performing, you know, to their standards in a job, um, they have no reason to, you know, suspect, uh, drug use or alcohol use or any kind of use and I think that, uh, job performance should be the criteria, you know, for, uh, whether or not a person is kept at a job and not drug testing.
R:  Okay.  I -- well, I -- I don't know.  What -- what are we doing here?  This is, uh, new to me.  I, uh 
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  What -- what am I supposed to do here?  I don't know what this call is about.
L:  Are you a Fisher participant?
R:  Uh, actually my wife is.
L:  Oh, well, she --
R:  I thought[?] I would do this for her.
L:  It was supposed to be a Fisher participant, uh, that -- that was kept on the call.  Is your wife available?
R:  No.  Not right now.
L:  Not right now.  All right, I guess then that --
R:  Am I just supposed to give you an opinion here?  Are you, uh, or what -- what's, uh --
L:  Yeah.  We're supposed to just talk about -- this is a study on, uh, how, you know, a linguistics study, uh, by the University of Pennsylvania, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they track, you know, how people, um, uh, transmit information to one another.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know.  So -- so what's --
R:  Where's[?] --
L:  -- your opinion on the, um, unannounced drug testing by companies.
R:  Well, my -- my opinion is that, uh, it's, uh, it's not an invasion of privacy because, uh, we deal with this every day.
L:  W- wait just a minute, Gary.  I'm gonna have to turn this thing off 'cause I can't -- really can't hear ya.  Okay, that might be better.  I'm sorry.  Can you --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- start again?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't think it's invasion of privacy.  Uh --
L:  No?
R:  I think that anybody that does the drugs is a danger to somebody around 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, especially at work.  You know, in construction work like I do, uh   Yeah, it's, uh -- where, you know, you using machinery or whatever you h- have to be using.  Uh, tools that are -- are dangerous and, uh, I've seen it too often.  We've, uh, actually, uh, you know, let people go for, uh, drug abuse.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, I've offered to give 'em help -- help them get help first and -- and most of 'em I -- I've very rarely seen anybody get -- get off of it.  Anybody that'll do it at home seems like they'll do it at work also.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I didn't even look at it from that viewpoint.  You know, you -- you definitely have a point where, um, you know, even in factory work or something like that.  I -- I was -- when I was, you know, giving my opinion I was thinking only of offices.
R:  Yeah, now --
L:  You know?
R:  [MN] I -- I have seen people in small cases that, you know, light drug use or something that they are -- are able to function in the workplace and not be a real danger, you know.  It depends.  I mean, marijuana or something to that affect.  But, uh, you know, I've -- in my line of work we -- we go through a lot of people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I've seen, uh, you know, heroin abuse, uh, crack, different type thing.  And, uh, you know, I've actually seen somebody just pass out --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- right on the job.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, uh, yeah, it's -- it's pretty dangerous.
L:  Do they take the same kind of stand, uh, with alcohol abuse?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] on the job, yeah.  I mean, a- alcohol abuse normally is a little more   I- it seems like you can -- you can pick it better I guess because you can smell the -- the alcohol or something.
L:  Yeah.  You could tell if they're --
R:  You can -- you can -- you can, uh, you can tell a little faster if somebody's drunk.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I mean, yeah.  The same -- same stand would be on -- with alcohol abuse but that -- that's the problem is you don't see it like you would with, uh, the -- the drugs.  You -- you can have somebody, uh, you know, at first they might just tell you they're not feeling well or something to that affect and you -- but, uh, it depends on what -- what they're taking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh --
L:  Well, then -- then do you feel that, uh, you know, only in certain occupations that it should be allowed or ?
R:  I -- I don't feel in any occupation I mean that it should be allowed really.  I mean, uh, i- it's [SIGH] I -- I --
L:  No, I mean, I -- I mean, in cert- -- do you feel that only in certain op- -- um, occupations that drug testing should be allowed?
R:  No.  No.  Just a- any occupation it should be.  I, um, I mean, I guess I s- stated that wrong.  Any occupation that you should not -- or you should be able to, uh, the boss should be able to drug test their employee.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, I -- I -- 
L:  Even for o- office workers that are not, you know, they're not, um, impinging on the safety of others and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, if -- if you're paying somebody you're buying their labor.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  And who -- who wants to buy somebody's labor that's, uh, strung out in some way or not --
L:  Well -- well that's why that y- --
R:  -- up to peak performance?
L:  You know, well that's what I -- that's what I, um, said when I -- I said, you know, it should be on job performance.  So, you know, uh, most likely somebody that is, um, you know a drug addict or, you know, abusing drugs is not gonna perform up to their standards anyway but --
R:  Normally, yes I would say that.
L:  -- d- does -- all right, think about this.  So -- all right so they can fire them for that but what about the rest of us who don't use drugs that are submitted to these -- to these drug tests that we have to take or we'll get fired?
R:  Yeah.  I [SIGH] -- I guess it would be, you know, a pain but, uh, it's not that hard to, you know, put a little urine in a cup.  It's not that big of a deal I wouldn't think if you don't have anything to hide with it.  So, yeah, it shouldn't be that big of a deal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I --
L:  Well, I don't know.  I would be insulted, you know, to have to go through these drug tests.  Uh, just it --
R:  I would be too but if everybody else was going through it then it's just, you know, it's not a big deal.  If you were singled out for some reason then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then, yeah.  I -- I w- -- I could see it being ve- very insulting.
L:  Well, I, you know, I went to, um -- years ago   This is years ago.  Um, I went to an interview, uh, at some company where I would just be working in an office and before they would even interview me, you know, once I'd filled out the application, uh, they wanted a drug test.  You know?  And -- and I was -- I was very insulted by that.  You know, I mean, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I don't know.  You know, it -- it's -- to me it's the same kind of thing as, um, you know, uh, when you -- your -- your -- your boss is supposed to be able to, um, get your medical records because he pays for the medical insurance and, you know, then he finds out, uh, somebody's HIV positive and they get fired because there's --
R:  Right.  I --
L:  You know, because -- because they think it's catching or something.  You know, they're -- they're discriminated against.  You know what I mean?
R:  Well, I -- yeah, I -- I could see that being a real problem.  I mean, that -- nobody should have that sort of, uh, information.  Uh, yeah, unless it was some sort of thing that may be required, you know, or may -- may jeopardize, uh, you know, another person's health they're working with but, uh, your boss should not be able to get your 
L:  See -- see I'm -- what I'm afraid of is just on general principle that the more freedoms and privacy that we give up, the more they're gonna take.  You know, right now I read in a -- a newspaper article about that there is technology that is available that can track us and know our location twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty five days a year.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Now, that's scary.  That sounds like Big Brother to me.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, so -- and this -- this technology is being developed, uh, because of, you know, terrorism.  So, they say the ordinary citizen has nothing to fear.  You know, that, um, uh, you know, it would just be terrorists that would be tracked, uh, but, you know, what about during the McCarthy era where, you know, um, everybody, you know, who was, uh, affiliated with the Communist Party was bo- brought in, dragged in, you know, before congress to find out, you know, what their affiliations were.  You know, if they were, you know, all that jazz.  Um, you know, those people certainly did not have any freedom or, you know, p- -- you know, rights to privacy and, you know, rights to political aff- affiliation.  Uh, you know, I'm just afraid that the more -- as I said, the more freedoms we give up, you know, that the worse it's gonna be for the ordinary citizen that -- that does nothing but go to work, come home to their little house with their little dog and kiddies.  You know, um, w- w- we -- you know, we won't be able to move around freely.  You know, they'll be drug testing us.  We'll be like little robots that have -- have to submit to their questions.  "Well, why were you talking to that person?"  You know, uh, well, "Oh, you, you know, you shop at, uh, Lord and Taylors so you must make a lot more than your income tax, you know, papers say".  And --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, [LAUGH] it --
R:  I see your point.  Yeah, it's --
L:  It's kind of scary.
R:  But it -- I just think with the drug testing, yeah, it's, uh, I think an employer -- employer should be able to know what kind of person they're hiring and that can tell a lot about 'em.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I -- I definitely, you know --
R:  Even when[?] --
L:  -- see your point and I agree that in -- in occupations where, uh, you know, how you work could, uh, you know, be a hazzard for the safety of other people I -- I think definitely there, you know, uh, it should be but, you know, if you're --
R:  Yeah, well the -- the average person that you hire is not just a recreational drug user if they're a drug user.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's, uh, I mean, they're -- a- and I
