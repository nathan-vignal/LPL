L:  Hi, this is Marissa.
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Marlene.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  I'm just great.
L:  Good.
R:  Ah, I guess we're supposed to talk about smoking in public places?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Well, what do you think about that?
L:  Well, I don't know about you, but -- and I actually am a smoker, but I don't think that you should be allowed to smoke in public s- -- public places.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I, you know what, I'm not a sm- I -- I'm not -- I am a non smoker, so I sort of agree with you, but I think -- what worries me about it is that um so much of it is going on that the infringement on our rights and people's rights, it's got me sort of worried about that.  But, on the other hand, um, I sort of agree with you, ah I don't like to sit down, have smoke around me, but yet I think that the way they have it um right now, like you can sit in a non smoker's area or a smoker's area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that's the way it should be.
L:  Well, in the State that I live in, um --
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Well, actually I live in Kansas.
R:  Kansas.  Oh, my gosh.
L:  [MN] Why, where are you?
R:  That is g- -- I'm North Carolina.
L:  You're North Carolin- 
R:  Yeah.  Could you tell my accent? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I should have known.
R:  I know, you should have known [LAUGH].
L:  But it doesn't necessarily mean you're there now [LAUGH].
R:  I know, but I am.  I'm here in North Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina, in fact.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, there is actually not in our State, but in the city --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I'm in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have made it um non smoking in like restaurants and on hospitals and on school campuses and that --
R:  So, you can't even smoke in the restaurants now?
L:  In -- in the city.
R:  In Kansas.
L:  Correct.  Yes.  Well, I don't know --
R:  Are you kidding?
L:  -- of Kansas, but just in --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the city that I'm in.
R:  Are you kidding?
L:  No.
R:  Oh my god.  Well, here in North Carolina, now they have like areas you -- like, smoking or no smoking.
L:  Right.
R:  And so you can go into smoking areas or non smoking areas --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think that's right because, you know, we don't want to take the rights away from I- -- even though I don't agree with it, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who am I to judge if you should smoke or not?  I mean, that's an individual's right and --
L:  Well, I hear what you're saying about that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I also have issue about um e- -- and it's funny because I am a smoker --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I have issue with infringing on other people's health.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry, what'd you say, I couldn't hear you?
L:  In circu- -- um, I have issue about infringing on other people's health --
R:  Yes.  I don't like -- you're right.  You're right about that, now.  See, I -- I agree with you on that.  I do.  But, you know what I think it is though, so many times, when you're in restaurants and some people are so blatant with it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before um this -- this came about that they had um areas where you sat in and you smoked and then areas you had where you didn't smoke, they s- people that -- what bugged me so bad is they didn't care if you came into the restaurant with little children or a baby even. 
L:  Right.
R:  They would still blow smoke right your way.
L:  Right.
R:  That's what made me so mad.
L:  Well, and they have just proven that second hand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- smoke is -- is dangerous --
R:  Yeah, of course it -- you know what, it's as bad as smoking, you know, you know, I'm s- --
L:  It is.
R:  -- lighting up a cigarette.
L:  It is, and --
R:  But, there again --
L:  -- and I try to be real --
R:  I don't want to --
L:  -- conscious --
R:  -- take away people's rights because I think the government right now is trying to take so many rights away from our people in I do- -- I don't -- I don't want that to happen, but I also agree with you that um, you know, you need to -- everything in the smoking thing needs to be regulated.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I agree with that.  But you need to have your rights, you know, that's my thing.  I think the rights have got to be, um, upheld.
L:  And -- and I agree with that, but sometimes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- your rights begin to infringe on other people's rights, like --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Like --
L:  -- the right to clean air for other people, or --
R:  -- yeah, exactly what -- what are --
L:  -- I mean, if you --
R:  -- the rights of people who do not smoke, you know, what --
L:  Pardon?
R:  -- what are our rights, I mean, what is my right because I don't -- I've never smoked in my life, but my -- my husband smokes and my daughters well, one of my daughters smokes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah -- and, you know, that's okay, that's fine.  But yet, do not bother me with it, you know, go out of here and do it and just don't bother me with it.  That's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think that's how the non smokers want it.  They do not want to go into a restaurant and be bothered with it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even though they sit in a non smoker's area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah you can still smell it.  You can still, know -- you know it's there.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, you know, I -- I can understand what you're saying.  I really can.
L:  And it's -- it's funny that I say it as a, you know, as a --
R:  Yeah, because you do --
L:  -- smoker.
R:  -- smoke.  But isn't that great that you know and you are sensitive to people who do not smoke.  But see, you know what, so many people who smoke are not like you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They do not care.
L:  Right.
R:  They do not think about it.
L:  Right.
R:  They're thinking about only themselves and what they want to do and i- you know, if you smoke, fine, if you don't, fine.  You need to be away from them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even though the smoke like carries a- you know, carries over to like three or four or five, six tables, you know, they don't care.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah, I get what you're saying, I really do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I understand and I agree with you on that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think what I'm afraid of is that I'm so scared, I don't want to get so carried away with all these things that our government -- I don't want our rights to ever be taken away from us.
L:  Well --
R:  And that's what I'm afraid of.
L:  And I hear that, but I also think that, you know, they're not saying you cannot smoke in your own home.
R:  Well, of course not --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they would never do that, but what I'm saying is --
L:  No, but they're saying that you can't have -- they're trying to say you can't have guns in your own home or --
R:  See, that's --
L:  You know what I mean.
R:  -- what I'm saying.
L:  Right.
R:  Where's it going to end?  My god.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do not tell me I cannot -- and I don't have a gun.  But don't tell me people cannot have a gun in their home if they ch- if they so desire.
L:  Right.
R:  Even though I don't agree with that.  But do not tell them they can't because to protect their family or whatever, you know, if they do it in the right way and -- which I'm a- totally against guns, but I don't know, I'm just so paranoid right now and people should be aware of the government taking away so many of our rights.  We've g- -- we've got to really be careful about it.  We g- --
L:  You're right.
R:  -- I don't think we need to stand on a soapbox, but we need to -- we need to watch it and it -- it starts, it's like my Dad used to say so many years ago, "Marlene, you've got to be careful because it starts very small" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then it comes over the years it gets bigger and bigger --
L:  Oh, you're right.
R:  -- so, you have to watch the small things --
L:  Well --
R:  -- because then they beca- they be- -- they become big things and large things.
L:  Well, I just heard on the news --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's interesting that you say that, um, in Kansas we have the option, or we used to have the option --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to put our social security number as our driver's license number --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you didn't want it, you didn't --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- have to do it, right?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Now they're making it a new law that you have to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- put your social security number down.  Which I --
R:  Oh, what do you mean, like --
L:  -- a- --
R:  -- on your social security, ah, I mean -- wait a minute.
L:  On your driver's license.
R:  On your driver's license you have to put your social security number on your license?
L:  Yes.
R:  You've got to be kidding me.
L:  No, and it used to be --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like I said, an option and I --
R:  See --
L:  -- opted not to because I didn't want --
R:  -- that is what I'm --
L:  -- everyone in the world --
R:  -- talking -- an option --
L:  -- to have.
R:  -- because the law.
L:  Right.
R:  That's not right.  See, I'm telling --
L:  It's not right, again.
R:  -- you.
L:  They -- ah they can track you with your --
R:  See.
L:  -- social security number.
R:  And it comes with this smoking thing.  Even though I don't like it, I don't like the -- I don't smoke, I don't -- I don't agree with it, but it's not that.  It goes beyond that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It goes beyond what the government is trying to take away from the -- the American people.
L:  Well, mm -- so they --
R:  The rights -- the rights of our people, you know, it's like you say, in Kansas look what -- look what that's, you know, what's happened.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Ah --
L:  Well, and again, it comes about -- it goes back to prohibition and then --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- should we legalize marijuana and --
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  It's linked --
R:  I don't know who --
L:  -- opens up a whole can of worms.
R:  I guess Canada is the only place you can go smoke pot and get by with it, I guess, you know.
L:  Oh, where --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you can go to Amsterdam --
R:  I guess that's the only -- that's the only one you can -- you can go to Canada to smoke pot and not have to worry about it, but --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  -- what I'm saying is that, you know, I'm like you.  I agree that you got to really watch -- watch the laws and -- and not, you know, it's like the government is going, okay, one step beyond, and one -- another step and another step and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the smoking thing it's not the smoking thing, that's not the thing.  It's what it means and what and what -- where's it going to end.  What else isn't -- you know, what's next?
L:  Right.
R:  And so I agree with that.  I agree with the people that -- that think that and say, okay, I don't, you know, be -- so -- and I'm not liberal, I'm not.  I am so not liberal.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I'm so liberal --
R:  But --
L:  -- it's not funny.
R:  Are you -- are you really?
L:  Yeah.  And then here I say that --
R:  Oh, that's g- 
L:  -- about --
R:  I'm not.
L:  -- I -- I -- you know --
R:  But I'm just so, um, I -- I'm very dependent and I don't want anybody to run over me or take my rights away --
L:  And that's good.
R:  -- and maybe I am liberal, more than I think I am.
L:  Well, that, you know, I agree.  I think when it comes to smoking I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- may choose to pollute my lungs and put my life at risk --
R:  Exactly, right.
L:  -- but should I -- should I subject --
R:  Should you put that --
L:  -- other people to it?
R:  -- so you smoke.  Should you -- should you, because you smoke, put that on someone else.  If you blow your smoke out, who -- who are you -- who are you going to affect with that smoke?
L:  Well, anyone in the room.
R:  Exactly right.
L:  Anyone in the room.
R:  But see, you are so rare that you think that way.  Because most smokers don't even give it a thought.  They really don't.
L:  Oh, I do.  I do.
R:  I'm serious, they don't.  They don't care.
L:  Well, I think --
R:  And I think --
L:  -- it's bad enough that I do it that I just don't --
R:  Well, I think you're -- I think you're  a wonderful person, I don't even know who you are, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think you're -- I think you're great to feel that way.  You are.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Because there's so many people who do -- who smoke that don't care, honey.
L:  Right.  Oh, I know.
R:  They really don't.
L:  I know.
R:  But you do care and so therefore you'll look around you to see who's around you and if you have to go outside and smoke your ci- then that's what you're going to do.  You know?  That's what you're going to do.  Because --
L:  Well and that's what we do at home because we have children and we don't want smoke around our children, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we smoke outside.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
