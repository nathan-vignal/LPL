L:  Hello.
R:  Yes, hello.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you doing?
L:  Fine, thank you.  So, we're going to have a big debate on smoking, right?
R:  I guess we are today.
L:  Uh, you're a no smo- -- non smoker?
R:  Um, I'm a social smoker. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, I'm a chain smoker. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I -- I -- I -- I have no problems with smoking.
L:  [LAUGH] I have none either but, [SIGH] y- you know, I --
R:  I --
L:  I- it seems that, you know, we're a minority, they tell us, but we're supposed to talk about banning smoking.
R:  Well --
L:  I think the idea is terrible.
R:  Well, actually, I do too.  They should allow a spot in every building or place for people to smoke.  If the world --
L:  Well --
R:  -- the government let it happen and [inaudible] got out of hand, so now they gotta live with it.
L:  Uh, w- well, this -- this is the problem, it's -- we are actually the m- m- majority of the ones who do not complain.  We're not standing out there protesting everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that happens, right?  Smoking keeps us calm. [LAUGH] So maybe the non smokers should try.  But, see, I don't think this is right, I think everybody should have a choice and there is ventilation systems for smoking areas and most of the people who are complaining about smoking are going into the non smo- -- into the smoking areas --
R:  I've seen that happen.
L:  -- and complaining. [NOISE] And it irritates you.  They stand and, you know, it's -- it plainly says --
R:  Right.
L:  -- smoking.
R:  Oh, especially like in a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a -- a bar, for example.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, I know in the state of Delaware, you're not allowed to smoke anywhere.  But I'm -- I'm from, uh, Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I know that about Delaware.
L:  Oh, well, i- --
R:  Which I think is ridiculous.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  Well, they're not that bad yet in South Carolina.
R:  -- what about you, are you from South Carolina?
