L:  I've read a lot of 'em, I believe families ought to be together.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Should stick together, play games, go places, would -- it's hard to do round -- people do that a lot around here.  It's something we do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Watch TV together.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What about yours?

L:  I live in Kentucky.
R:  Oh, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I'm in Lexington.
L:  Oh, I'm in -- up here in Ashland[?].
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah, well, I'll say my parents have been married almost fifty years.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And, you know, so, we've been ah real close and real family oriented.
L:  Well, mine -- my both parents are deceased.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mine was ah -- mother died when I was um twenty two, I think it was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she's been gone a long time.  My dad died just a few years ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I don't have neither one of them, but I got a sister here and she lives with me and I got --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my daughter and my husband and [PAUSE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we, you know, we just more or less all live together here [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It's hard -- I don't know how -- what to say here, or what they want us to talk about.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't know.  Um, um, I would say that my sister has done a lot for me, you know, and we -- she has been real good to me, you know, I can always count on her.
L:  Well, that's nice.  Kathy's like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she's ah -- you know, she's -- she's here when I need her and she --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [inaudible] when I have problems and stuff.  My husband is disabled, so -- and well, she is too, but she -- he had a stroke, so it's not easy for him to [several inaudible words] and stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she watches the baby when I have to take her to the d- take him to the doctor and stuff and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just, you know, it works out pretty good.
R:  Yeah.  You know, um, I don't know what people will do, the people that get divorced so m-  -- I'm married and I have two kids, a daughter who's ten --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and a son five --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but [inaudible] daughter's my step daughter 'cause my -- my husband was married before.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But his wife's gone and doesn't have any contact with ah her daughter, which is really kind of strange, but um --
L:  That's sad, isn't it?
R:  It is.  It is in a way.  But I think better off if she just stays away.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, you know, people -- so many people are getting a divorce that um, you know, who are they going to count on when they get older, you know?
L:  That's right.
R:  There's going to be a lot of lonely people.
L:  Well, that's what I think of Christina, my little girl --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she's ah, you know, she's got her aunt here she depends on and, you know, momma and then daddy, you know, daddy's not well, but daddy does what he can and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and now he's -- we're all right here and we're all here for her 'cause she's the only one around, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there ain't a lot of children around, so she gets all the attention --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I know when we were little, I mean, the world revolved around the kids, like Christmas --
L:  Uh-huh --
R:  -- and everything.  I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was for the kids.
L:  That's exactly the way it is now with mine.  I mean, more or less it's just we, we have a ball, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at the holiday season, 'cause that's what she's enjoys and stuff, she, you know [PAUSE] we just take care of each other best we can.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Like when ah when we were going up, you know, things was hard, but my father and my mother stayed married, they was together for twenty five years before she passed away.
R:  Mm.  See, that's wonderful.  That's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  I don't know what people are thinking when they, you know, get married and then split up and get married again and [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I -- I'm -- my husband's my second one, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but they was -- I was married to my first one for eleven years --
R:  Oh, my.  That's --
L:  -- and had no children from the marriage --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and then -- and just lo- I think more or less, I don't know how to explain this situation, so [LAUGH]--
R:  Yeah, well, that's okay.  I don't think we've got that much time, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um --
L:  But --
R:  -- yeah, my um, my sister, I've got a sister who was divorced, she had one daughter --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and um was divorced and then got remarried and has two sons and then um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] but you know, in the neighborhood the kids that my kids play with --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a lot of them they live, you know, with just their mom or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and -- and sometimes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] their dad's coming over to pick 'em up for the weekend and --
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean there.
R:  -- you know.
L:  I -- I've set ah -- like a little girl that lives a couple houses down, well she did, she was an adopted, or -- not adopted, but she was a foster child --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- our little girl got real close with her and then all of a sudden she was gone and, you know, and I just felt for the little girl.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because she don't have a stable environment, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to be in.  You know, we d- we do our best for Christina, you know, everything she needs or wants and all this --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know.  And I can't see a child being -- I guess I'm being funny, I just can't see a parent not wanting a child.
R:  Right.  Just leave a child out there on their own and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and they go from house to house, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-uh.
R:  -- whatever.
L:  I -- I'd -- my husband has a daughter, a step, this is my step daughter and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- sometimes I think that she's went from one place to another place and I kept -- if I ever have a child, I will never, ever let her be a person that'd be here one weekend, here another weekend and there another weekend.  I just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and so far I stand good on that word.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband -- we get along good, you know, everybody else -- we spat, like everybody else, but that's the way it goes.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But --
R:  Well, I -- I've got a friend in Arkansas and um her sister takes in foster children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, they take in, you know, probab- and then they've adopted several of them --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- but they start out as foster children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, they take in foster children and then, you know, as they stay with them for a while then they end up adopting 'em [LAUGH].
L:  That's what I --
R:  -- so --
L:  That -- I want to do that so bad here, a couple of years ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I was so scared that if I did --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that then, you know, they'd come in and they would take them away for somebody else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I said, "That would kill me, it would just tear my heart out" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Sometimes they send them back to their own home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- where they, you know, have some problems --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think the -- the Courts really like to see them with -- with their biological family --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  -- if they can, but, you know, sometimes that's not the best thing, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I don't either, it's -- it's unreal sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just -- I mean, being at home with some of the parents that some of these kids have got is not good.
R:  Mm.
L:  I'm not saying that I'm the best parent in the world, but I'm not the worst either [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We all have our down --
R:  Well --
L:  -- falls you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  I -- yeah.  I know I could do things better sometimes.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yell too much, probably.
L:  That's me.
R:  But [LAUGH].
L:  That sounds just like me.
R:  Oh --
L:  But I -- d- you know, sometimes I get to -- she's so hard headed but she's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she's very sweet --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she's very loving, but she has got a hard head --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she gets that one thing in her head and she ain't going -- nobody can change it for her [LAUGH].
R:  Well, see, that can be a good quality.
L:  Yes, ma'am.  It can be.
R:  That can be a good quality.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because like we went to Kings Island and, you know, my kids, they didn't want to ride some of these rides and I thought, "You know, that's their basic instinct telling them, 'Hey, this is not' --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- you know, something good" and I'm like, I didn't want to make them ride because I'm thinking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you -- you know, [SIGH] if you go against that instinct, you might go against it when you need that, that instinct that tells you, "Stay away from this, it's dangerous".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I want them to kind of keep that [LAUGH].
L:  What I say to Christina, she tells me she's [inaudible] and I won't force her into doing it, you know, I say "Well, okay then --" 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- you know, it's up to you, honey, you're old enough to know, you know, what you want to do and what you don't want to do" --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- at one point.  You know, she said, but if it's something she wants to do, she's not forced to do, but --
R:  Yeah.  I was going to ask you how old she was.
L:  She's seven.
R:  Seven.
L:  And she's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she's -- she can be a handful sometimes, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- most she is for her age she's very intelligent, you know, she's very cautious of things --
R:  Uh-huh.  Is she in -- what in, the second grade, or --
L:  She goes to second grade in August.
R:  Wow.  Wow.
L:  So, but, you know, she's growing up real quick on me, unfortunately [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, um, I'm going to home school my kids this fall.
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I had actually thought about doing that because my sister was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, she was a substitute for all of my husband would teacher in New York where he was from --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I thought if ah, you know, maybe home school her --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but then I got to thinking, "She's an only child and she would be making" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know --
R:  [LAUGH] She --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- really wouldn't have much contact with -- with -- would she?
L:  Oh, she, you know, all she's got is her school friends and a few [inaudible] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- here in the neighborhood, you know, ah [several inaudible words] I think she'll be able to take her [inaudible] to a ah school
