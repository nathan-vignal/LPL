R:  Yeah, hi, I'm Max.
L:  This is Becky.
R:  Hi, Becky.  I didn't hear [MN] the whole topic.  Will you repeat it for me?
L:  Uh, censorship [NOISE] --
R:  On boo- -- something about books, though?
L:  Yeah, books.  Uh, do, uh, private or public schools have the right to censor books?
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, um, I believe that some censorship is always necessary because, you know, kids have fragile minds.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].
R:  But in general I don't think that books should be censored based just on other people's opinions, unless they contain some content that's really disgraceful.
L:  Mhm.  I agree.  I think that parents have a right to know what's in their ki- -- in the school's library [SIGH] and what their children are reading.
R:  Exactly.  But the --
L:  [NOISE] And they --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  -- and then if they don't approve, maybe they need to [SIGH] -- they need to read the books and, uh, discuss them with their children.  I mean, they [MN] -- you know, before they just say, "Well, those aren't good books" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they ought to know what their children are reading [NOISE].
R:  I mean, there was a time in this country when libraries were -- were banning Huck Finn, you know, and the -- you know, classics like that, because some people felt some of the content [SIGH] offensive, and obviously, you know, that's not right [MN].  Um, but --
L:  Yeah, well, if they ban something like that they have to ban [SIGH] -- I mean, there's a lot of Christian books being banned just because they don't wanna use those [SIGH] and I think that's wrong.
R:  I agree.  As long as -- as long as you explain to children that, you know, these aren't everybody's beliefs --
L:  Yes [NOISE].
R:  -- um, you know, they're just some people's beliefs, I think that the more children see, you know, the more diverse, um, topics [MN] children can read about, the better off they'll be in the long run.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] At the same time, you don't want a book in the library that teaches a child how to build a bomb [MN].
L:  No, [LAUGH] I agree there.  I think we've had too much of that lately.
R:  Mhm.  So -- so I guess it's -- it's a fine line, but, um, you know, because some censorship's necessary, but too much is -- is definitely a bad thing.
L:  Yes.  I think if we censored too many things, we're gonna have book burnings again like they did in [SIGH] [NOISE] -- I mean, the -- the [inaudible] like they did in Germany, and everything will be --
R:  Right, [SIGH] because --
L:  -- censored.
R:  -- exactly, because who's to say what's appropriate and what's not?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I think that -- I don't think that the country's necessarily doing such a bad job in that area right now.  I mean, I know that -- I think I had the opportunity to read all different types of books when I was in school [MN].  I didn't feel like I was censored all that badly.
L:  Oh, I don't think we were.  Uh, I think that they need to do a little bit more of it now [SIGH].  There wasn't a controversy over the books and stuff.  I mean, there wasn't a lot of [SIGH] --
R:  There was less controversy when w- -- twenty years ago, you think?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yes.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I've -- [MN] everything wasn't so open.
R:  Yeah, I guess that's true.
L:  [NOISE] Everything wasn't so open, I mean, homosexuality and [SIGH] -- and of course I grew up [SIGH] when they were just started desegregation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [SIGH] we didn't think anything about it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, and now [SIGH] the books like Tom Saw- -- I mean, like, [SIGH] um, what's the one with the black man in it and -- and, uh ...?
R:  Huck -- Huck Finn?
L:  Yeah, but there's one -- Brer Rabbit --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and all those.
R:  Right.
L:  We didn't think anything about it.  We just thought they were classics, and now they're making a big deal out of it being a black book and [SIGH] -- and bad for the kids and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, I mean, [SIGH] there's too many people making a big deal out of nothing when if they'd a just left it alone, no one would have thought anything about it.
R:  W- well, that's the other thing, is if you tell children, "Don't read this" the first thing they're gonna do is go try and get their hands on it.  
L:  Right.
R:  Whereas if you just leave it in the library, it probably it's not gonna cause much controversy.
L:  And I just really believe that -- I mean, there's books that I read when I was a kid that they're telling me now are bad, that I never thought there was anything wrong with them.  If they hadn't a brought it up I'd a never thought anything about it.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  It's [MN] -- no, I think that's definitely part of the problem [SIGH].  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's once you make a big deal out of something --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- the child is all that much more likely to -- whereas if you just let them discover it on their own --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things probably won't be as bad.  
L:  Uh, [MN] I agree there.  I think that we just [SIGH] -- that a lotta people have made too much out of too little, and they just need to leave things alone and let the children decide.  And, I mean, I think that -- that as parents, I have an obliga- -- as a parent and a grandparent, I have an obligation to know what my children [NOISE] doing.  But I don't think that we oughta [SIGH] -- [MN] we oughta just ban it just because [SIGH] it's got some content referral in it to a black or to [SIGH] -- you know, there's a lot more to be said about some of the other things that they're reading --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than that.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, if -- you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- to ban a book because there's someone black or someone gay in it, compared to the movies and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and television shows that our kids are gonna get -- go home and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- watch on -- on television, it seems a little silly in the year two thousand and three, you know?  I mean, [SIGH] every child -- just about every child now has access to the internet, and God knows what they can find on there.  
L:  Yeah, I mean if they're gonna do -- I mean, the -- I don't think they're gonna have explicit [SIGH] pictures in 'em like they do on the internet.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Like they -- I mean, you know, the -- [SIGH] I think that -- I had a hard time [MN] learning to read as a child [SIGH].  There were words that I couldn't, you know, I couldn't tell the difference in 'em.  Really, back then, they didn't know about dyslexia and all that, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it was just a deal that wasn't a big deal and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you either flunked or you passed.  I mean, you [MN] -- there wasn't this deal --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- about where you were, you know?  And [SIGH] they didn't make a deal about, "Well, let's find something for this kid that doesn't like to read so they will read".  
R:  Right, right.  No, they --
L:  You read what they gave you to read, and [SIGH] -- and if we'd [SIGH] just [MN] leave the kids alone and let 'em learn on their own --
R:  Could you hold on one second for me?
L:  Yes.
R:  Thanks.  
L:  [MN] Cut me off.  Well, okay.  Okay.  There, that feels better.  What are you up to, huh?  What are you doing?  You want some lotion on your legs too?  Hmm?  You want some lotion on your legs too?  You want some on you?  There you go.  Doesn't that feel good?  [NOISE] Hmm?  We gotta go wipe your nose again [NOISE].  There we go [NOISE].  Don't -- I'm sorry -- I'm sorry.  [MN] Let's look at the book.  You wanna look at the book with G?  Hmm?  There's a garden, and there's a garden.  I like the garden things.  [NOISE] Yeah.  Ninety nine dollars, dang, we can't afford that one.  [NOISE] Uh-uh.  Where're you going?  Uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh, no.  Damien, no.  [NOISE] [SIGH] No.  Well, hurry up.  Let's go and look at the book, okay?  [NOISE] [SIGH] Look in here, how pretty -- say, "Pretty".  I think he's gonna hang up and call the other line.  [NOISE] [several inaudible words]
