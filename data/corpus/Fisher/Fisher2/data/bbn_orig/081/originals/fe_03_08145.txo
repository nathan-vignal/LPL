L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  This is Kelly.
L:  Hi.  What -- I don't even know what this is.
R:  Um, it's some sort of research that some university is doing and they give you a topic and you're supposed to talk about it for ten minutes and then they compile, um, [LIPSMACK] compile all the data.
L:  Huh.  That's weird.  Uh, I don't -- I don't really know.  I don't really have an opinion.
R:  You have no opinion of drug testing?
L:  Well, I mean, I guess it would be an invasion of privacy.
R:  Well, do you think of -- the business have a right know?
L:  Well --
R:  Have you ever been drug tested?  Yes?
L:  Uh, no.  Have you?
R:  Uh, not by the current company --
L:  By your company?  Or by your job?
R:  But I mean if people are gonna do drugs there are so many things out there that they're gonna take to pass a drug test anyway unless they give very short notice.
L:  Well, I -- I figure, you know, somebody's gonna be doing drugs and you can't tell if they're doing them; then what's the harm?  You know, I -- if you don't -- don't really need to test somebody if like -- if it's -- if it's really affecting them that much you would just be able to tell.
R:  Yeah.  Well, but like train conductor.  If there's nobody really there to [inaudible] them then they test them so that they know. [PAUSE]
L:  Well, they ha- -- they have to talk to somebody throughout the day.  Somebody else who works at the country who would -- who would know if they're, uh, you know, using drugs.
R:  No, if you just talk to somebody I don't -- I have, uh, I probably would vote if I owned a big business and that I had a lot of liability I would definitely drug test because, well, like a driver for me that haul big explosives --
L:  What exactly would be the liability though?
R:  You know.  Yeah, drug test.  Yeah.  I mean, working at a McDonalds; I don't think that's a drug test.
L:  Okay.  Okay, yeah.  I guess it would depend on what the -- what the type of work it is.
R:  Yeah, but Walmart does[?].
L:  Well, yeah, they -- they don't do that anyway.  I don't think.
R:  And I think that in drug testing I think -- and I think most companies are like that.  They give us so much of a percentage before they're gonna fail you.
L:  And see I don't -- I don't know.  They -- what does it -- what does it matter, you know?  If they're gonna be 
R:  Yeah, you know, so many mano grams.  Depends on the company.  The company will decide what the [inaudible] failure [inaudible].
L:  Oh, really?  So, you can -- you can use a little bit and, uh, get away with it?  Is that what 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.  Well, um, what about like -- well I know like a lot of corporations who -- people who work in offices in cubicles and things like that drug test and -- and if you're gonna be doing that you're not gonna be really endangering anybody, uh, from some previous drug use.  Then what would be the harm, you know?
R:  No   Yeah   Like I said, it -- it depended on what liability I had and, uh, I think drug testing if -- I don't think just random -- I don't think drug testing [inaudible] job but I think if you see pattern going on of something then I think at some time drug testing.  I don't think it should be like outlawed that you can't do it.  No.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like if you notice somebody's doing it of course they're not gonna admit they are so you have to test them to be able to prove that they were.
L:  Right.
R:  So, in that aspect I'd say, yeah.
L:  But you don't think it should be, uh, mandatory for a   Okay, yeah.  Yeah, that's how I feel too.
R:  So, um, well [several inaudible words] but it's not an invasion of my privacy.  I don't do drugs any more so it doesn't matter to me.  When I was younger   I was younger, I did but always -- and they got all the stuff in stores.  You just drink it and it's   Yeah.  They got stuff that washes -- you can wash in your hair and it, you know, some [several inaudible words] hair samples now and they ask if you can wash in your hair and -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- they analyze for drugs.
L:  I mean, there's plenty of products that you can take to, uh, get rid -- get rid of the drug.
R:  It's supposed to be more, um, you know, you can tell 'em like okay with -- oh, in the last two weeks they used it but before that, you know, they didn't.  It like puts a timeline in your hair because your hairs grows a little each day.
L:  Hair samples?  What do they do with that?
R:  Right.  It's more detailed.  But, yeah, I've never had that test done and I don't think I would.  I don't think 
L:  Oh.  Yeah, okay.  So, it's more accurate I guess than using the   Uh-huh.
R:  But I mean, a few companies -- if -- if I was a business owner and [inaudible] liability.  I would go, "Okay, you, drug test right now.  Let's go now".
L:  So, when a -- when a company asks you to drug test is it, uh, do they ask -- well, can you -- if you say, "No", do you automatically get, uh, fired?
R:  You know?  If I was gonna do it that's the way I'd do it.  I'm not gonna go, "Okay, you're getting drug tested tomorrow morning".  Exactly.  So, what's the point of that?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, whatever.  Yeah.  And what amazes me is that people that do drugs still fail the drug test when they've had two weeks notice.
L:  Yeah, I guess it's --
R:  Like, me 
L:  Yeah, 'cause it, you know, it gives them time to --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think that if I was doing drugs and they said, " [inaudible] drug test right now", and go, "I quit".  That's it.
L:  E- -- yeah.  I guess there really would be none 'cause then they could just go drink the clear out stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I don't want you to fire me so I'm just gonna quit.  Yeah.  You can't say you were fired[?] for drug use.
L:  Yeah, by that time you -- if you know you're gonna fail you might as well just quit. [LAUGH] Save yourself the embarassment.
R:  But invasion of privacy I think is taken[?] a bit too far sometimes.  I don't think   I -- I think it has anything -- I'm not against or for drug testing just because it's an invasion of privacy.
L:  Yeah, might as well.
R:  Uh, I don't -- I don't think -- and I don't think --
L:  You should at least, uh, use it on your next resume or whatever.
R:  Um 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Well, but if I'm wanting the job then it's my choice whether I wanna go get drug tested or not.  You know, and if I want the job they're gonna tell 'em that they're doing random testing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've already agreed to it if I went work there.
L:  Okay, so you don't think it has anything to do with your rights? [PAUSE]  I guess i- it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It would be a -- an invasion of -- to privacy for people who don't have or see anything wrong with drug use, you know?
R:  But invasion of privacy would be going   That they just randomly picked me off the street and go, "Let's drug test you.  See if you're doing drugs".  Yeah.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Or you get pulled over for speeding ticket and they wanna drug test me.  Just 'cause I was speeding.  Now that's an -- I think that's more of an invasion of my privacy.
L:  That's true.  But, uh, yeah, [NOISE] you're right.  So, it r- -- it really -- it's really not an invasion it's just, uh, [NOISE] makes it difficult for drug users to get jobs. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  I agree to it.  Yeah.  Well, I should've kept a stop watch.  So, are you signed up this or did you just answer the phone?
L:  Yeah.  And you -- and you had nothing to say about it.  You couldn't, you know, do 
R:  Somebody -- yeah, somebody from your house had [inaudible] for it 'cause it's a website that you sign[?] up.
L:  Right.  Yeah, 'cause you, you know, that's not enforced -- or I mean, it is enforced.  There's -- these other things are just, you know, they ask you -- you already -- and you already know before.  So 
R:  And then they pay you ten dollars for e- -- call that you do.  Yeah.  So, somebody's making ten bucks off of your call today. [LAUGH] 
L:  I thi- --
R:  No.  Actually they're gonna -- they're gonna pick -- I don't know how many hundreds of people out of these initial calls; 'cause initially you only get three calls.  They're gonna pick certain people out of it that are gon- -- gonna continue doing phone calls.  They have -- forget how many more weeks of study they're gonna be doing.
L:  Well, they been calling here   I don't know.  We have caller ID and it says University of Pennsylvania.  They've been calling here for the past couple of weeks so I just picked it up and, uh, you know, this is what it is. [LAUGH]   Okay.
R:  Probably because m- -- you get, uh, you get three calls and they also get a number where you can call in.
L:  Really?  So --
R:  'Cause see I called in 'cause I missed my call yesterday so --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- they give you a eight hundred [inaudible] pin number that you call in and it connects you with somebody.
L:  Um, is it -- you know what they're gonna do with this research?
R:  And you call in and see what the topic of the day is.  Whether you wanna do it or not.  Yeah.  No, they give it to you when you sign up.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You call and like the other day the topic of the day was playing, uh, [inaudible] game.  Yesterday it was terrorism.  I didn't -- I didn't wanna talk about that.
L:  So, am I gonna be getting another call, do you know?
R:  So, invasion of privacy, drug testing.  I figured I could do that today.
L:  Okay.
R:  They record calls and   Yeah.  So, um   It comes up and it beeps and it says, "You have thirty seconds left.  Say your goodbyes". [inaudible]
L:  Oh, really?  So, they'll give that to -- they'll give that number to me after this call, do you know?
R:  I don't remember, uh, uh, trying to think what else I can say about drug testing.
L:  [LAUGH] It's, uh, hm.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, and I guess depends on what kind of drugs.  I mean --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You gonna 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think if it's somebody that's, you know, smoking and [several inaudible words] it's just like people that take[?] valiums.
L:  Yeah, it said that in -- in the beginning this is being recorded.
R:  You know?
L:  I gotta [inaudible] -- I figure it's gotta be ten minutes by now. [PAUSE] Oh, really? [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's really cut and dry kinda whether you're -- what your opinion is about it. [NOISE] Well, if you -- if it -- if it's a heroin user and you can clearly see that they're [LAUGH] falling asleep and whatever at the job [NOISE] then, yeah. [PAUSE] [NOISE]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, you know, there's plenty of, uh
