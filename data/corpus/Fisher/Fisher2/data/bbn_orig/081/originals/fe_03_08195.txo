L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name is Charles Gillatt.
R:  Hi, I'm Cindy.  
L:  Hi, Cindy [SIGH].
R:  Hi.
L:  Uh, well, I guess it's a hot topic these days --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about, uh, censorship or, uh, uh, about books -- what you can read or cannot read [SIGH].  Uh, [SIGH] I don't know.  I never thought about much [SIGH] as I was younger and going to school, but I think as I get older and I see some of the material that seems to be, uh, published, uh, I begin to wonder whether or not we shouldn't restrict, uh, uh, the reading of certain kinds of books for our youngsters in school.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, a- a good case of that would be, like, uh, several years ago when Madonna came out with her book.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, I'm not -- I'm not sure if you saw that, but, uh, I can't imagine if that was available in public schools.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I don't know if it -- if it was or -- or not.  I would certainly, uh, hope not.  I, um, [MN] I just find the, um [MN] -- I guess as we, uh, get older and think back a little bit about some of the things that we used to read about [SIGH] and, I don't know, some classics that I guess now some people are saying, uh, uh, that they're -- they're almost as bad, [SIGH] uh, but I -- I don't know.  Maybe it's the way they were written, and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the material covered just seems to me, [SIGH] um, is a lot different than, uh, uh, than what I read about today.  The kinds of books that -- that you -- you hear [MN] about that youngsters want to read [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- though, uh, I, uh, I don't know -- I -- I have, uh, [SIGH] some grandchildren going to school, and, uh, I do wonder about some of the -- the books they -- we try to encourage them to read, [SIGH] uh, and, uh, the -- it seems to me that, uh, we ought to encourage them to read a lot of material, [SIGH] uh, and I suppose it doesn't hurt to read something that's on the -- on the borderline, but [SIGH] I worry about, uh, them going too far out.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think that -- that, you know, the schools should monitor the books that come in.  I don't -- I don't know that it should be necessarily left up to just the school board to decide.  I think, you know, that the parents should be included in that.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  I -- I would agree with you.  Uh, because I think parents have to -- have to participate --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and take an active, uh, role in [MN] what their children are reading [SIGH].  Uh, it seems to me, uh, [SIGH] they, um, they [MN] bring a book home and, uh, the parent should be interested enough to find out, uh, what the book is, if they don't -- if they are not knowledgeable about it, uh, they certainly ought to at least scan it a little bit just to find out what it is -- what is in there.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  And if they have a question, it seems to me they would have the right to, uh, go back to the, uh, teacher or the school, um, probably the [SIGH] -- the school board itself, to question why that particular book, um, is being used.
R:  Mhm.  [MN] I -- it's weird.  When I was in high school, [MN] we weren't allowed to read the Bible --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in school, [SIGH] but in our school library there were books on, you know, all kinds of religions, like, uh, wicca and, you know, various other types of religion.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I just think that's strange.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, you mean you weren't allowed to read the Bible, what, in [MN] -- in your classroom itself?  Out loud or ...?
R:  W- well, we weren't allowed to bring one to school, and it -- one wasn't available in the school library.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but you could go to the school library an- and read about all kinds of other religions, but christianity, you know, they kinda --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, kinda pushed that aside.
L:  Yeah, that does, um, seem a little strange.  I don't think, uh, [SIGH] I'm aware of, uh, [MN] that kind of a situation either [SIGH] when I was going to school or [SIGH] from what I can hear about from my, uh, uh, children or my grandchildren.  Uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that just, uh -- I -- that seems very, very strange.
R:  Yeah, it was.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, [MN] but, of course, the problem is, I guess, with, uh, with the books, uh, just like anything else you go, [SIGH] uh, y- you -- maybe in a way you think you're sheltering, um, the youngsters from, um, from something that goes on in the world, and then you turn around and they might, [SIGH] uh, see even more ther- -- more than that if they read a newspaper or they read one of these, [LIPSMACK] uh, uh, magazines that you might see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the grocery store.
R:  Yeah, or --
L:  Or -- or --
R:  -- or watch it on television.
L:  [MN] That's true.  It's, uh -- that has opened it up so much more [SIGH] than -- than what it used to be, [SIGH] uh, and it just seems to me [SIGH] the other kinda books that you used to read, they were always action stories about, [SIGH] oh, adventure, sports, uh, um, uh, history --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- geography or something like that, that [MN] it could, uh, grab your attention and keep you busy, even as a youngster.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Though I -- [MN] I don't know.  I, uh, uh, I'm not that familiar so much with the -- the local schools at the moment, 'cause I don't have anybody going to school right here where I'm living, [SIGH] uh, but I know in the -- in the library, uh, [SIGH] they have problems on [MN] trying to control what kinda books that they have where [SIGH] some people, uh, want them to restrict books, um, and then as they try to exercise that, [SIGH] if you will, censorship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, then they have a problem, uh, because people don't believe in that.
R:  Right.
L:  They say it should be exposed [SIGH] to anybody who wants to, uh, to read it.  Uh, it's --
R:  Well, but the -- I think that may serve true for adults, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we're not talking about adults in school.  You know, I -- I do think that the schools should be allowed to censor it, but I don't think, like I said before, it should be left up to just a handful of people, you know?
L:  Mhm.  [MN] Well, of course the -- the, uh, the teachers ask the youngsters to go to the library to get material, or to get a book [SIGH].  They may or may not have a library at the school, [SIGH] uh, a lot of school systems use the public library [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, uh, they go to the public library and nobody's sorta looking over their shoulder to see what they've picked up or what they're sorta reading.  [SIGH] Um, there again, the parent has to become involved and participate, uh, and, if you will, control.
R:  Right.  I -- I wasn't aware that schools use public libraries.
L:  Oh, well, they have -- I mean, they may have a small library --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- in their school.
R:  I thought you meant, like, no library at all.
L:  Oh, I [MN] -- well, I guess many years ago, I went to a school where you didn't have a library [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  
L:  But that was a little different.  Uh, nowadays I guess they all have a library, but [SIGH] a lot of 'em are, um, if you will, um, th- they utilize the public library because it might be, [SIGH] uh, in the same, um, building, or the, uh, building right is, uh, adjacent to, uh, the -- the school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so it's a lot easier for them to make use of the, uh, public library.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's, uh -- that -- that of course throws a little different picture on it, uh --
R:  Yeah, it does.
L:  -- [MN] a little different issues, uh, that arise, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] but, uh, i- it's there and, uh, so, uh [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But of course, as you [MN] -- as you had mentioned, uh, the, um, the fact that the youngsters can go to, uh, uh, the movies or the TV [SIGH] and you -- it's so easy, [MN] let's say, to see, uh, on, uh, on a film, on a picture, on the screen, uh, something that you're saying, "Well, I'm not so sure you'd be reading about all that stuff".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you can almost see it, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, [MN] before you know it, on public -- on public television --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- or going -- going out to a movie.  It's pretty hard these days to [SIGH] -- to go to a [SIGH] -- a movie, even if it's -- I guess they call it PG or whatever, and yet you look at it and you see what's going on and you listen to the language, and you say, "Oh, my gosh, I --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- I thought this was PG" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  That doesn't seem to have the same meaning --
R:  Yeah, pretty much i- if you want to -- it's kinda off of the topic, but -- for today, but if you wanna see a movie that doesn't have, you know, anything at all like curse words or [SIGH] sex or violence or anything, you've gotta go with a G rated movie --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is like, you know, they used to have family shows like that on TV on the regular main networks.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Yeah, but now you -- you'd have to have cable and have one of the specialty channels --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know?
L:  Of course, you go with -- to cable, and all of a sudden you've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really opened [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- a whole new, uh --
