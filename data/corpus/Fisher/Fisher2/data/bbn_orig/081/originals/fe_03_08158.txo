L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Libbie.
L:  I'm Jill Philips.  How are you?
R:  Hi Jill.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Louisiana.  Where are you at?
R:  I'm in Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's not too far away.
R:  Oh.
L:  Considering [LAUGH].
R:  Ah.  Sounds pretty far.  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  What -- what are you views on the morals of today?
R:  Well, I was a little confused about what they said, exactly what we were supposed to talk about, something about divorce rates and ...?
L:  Yes.  They want --
R:  I got --
L:  -- to know if what our moral values are, and what -- has -- have our views changed on the increase of the divorce rate and on marriage and things of that nature [SIGH] in this time --
R:  I don't think mine has.
L:  Mine are.  I'm fifty six --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- I sound like I'm fourteen, but mine are [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.  I'm fifty five, so we're --
L:  [LAUGH] Then we're the same --
R:  -- we're the same.
L:  We're in the same category.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, our moral values are going up and we're getting -- I'm getting closer to my moral values because I don't want to be around some people -- and I'm not prejudiced.  I'm a Christian and I'm not a religious person, I'm just a Christian.  I believe in doing right.  And some of the moral values even in my church, I just -- I can't see.  I don't know what to do with them.  My -- my views have not changed, they've just gotten stronger.  And I don't keep my mouth shut anymore, I just open it and let it fly [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I guess as my [SIGH] as my kids have grown and well my third one is now living with someone before they were married and it's like, "Well, her brother's did it too, what can I say, but I don't have to like it" --
L:  Mhm.  That's my thing --
R:  -- um, you know, almost all my friends' kids have done the same thing.  It's just almost like that's expected now, but it still doesn't mean I have to think it's the right thing to do --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But it just ah [SIGH] you know, watching TV it -- it -- it does seem like it's really hard to ah instill what's really moral to our children when what they're seeing on TV is so different than what we um would like -- like it to be.
L:  And what -- what's portrayed in their life at school, where they spend ninety percent of their time, I mean where they grow up.  Let me tell you something.  When you start handing out condoms in school instead of saying, you know, "This is okay to -- to do this" that's exactly what they're saying instead of saying, "Accidents and safe, you know, it's safe sex" I've gone through that.  I've got one right now, my youngest one -- well, she's my step daughter -- but she's living with somebody, she doesn't intend to get married.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I have had my ah my daughter, my natural daughter, virtually when I divorced her h- my first husband, she came up pregnant.  I have a granddaughter that doesn't have a father and she got married to a -- a person that was really nice and he, you know, they've got three kids otherwise and he adopted my oldest granddaughter, but, mom, she tells me she's a mom.  Everybody does it.  I said, "But you have a Christian upbringing, you know better".  I said, "Your values are not, you know, like that" but, you know, when they're around that and they -- they have that kind of peer pressure and everything else, it's difficult.  I don't think we had it that hard coming up.
R:  Yeah, I just um I see so many young girls having babies outside of marriage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I mean, well they do have fathers too and my second son fathered a baby ou- before they got married -- they did get married -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then proceeded to get divorced a year and a half later --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but um [LIPSMACK] and my daughter, who was younger at the time, just said, "Mom, get over it, it happened".
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  But it just seems like it's just more and more and -- and it -- it's -- it's accepted now and it ah --
L:  I ah I didn't fuss at her, I loved her.  Now she -- she got offensive because I told her she had other options besides -- I wasn't saying, "You have to do this.  I want to know what your mental, c- you know, state of mind is" and things of that nature.  Man, I started a turmoil because I was liberated enough to say, you know, "Rach, what do you want to do?  Do you want to have this baby?  Do you want to get married to the fa--" "No.  I don't even know who the father is."
R:  Oh.
L:  I said, "Oh my -- talk about sick".
R:  Oh yeah, I can imagine.
L:  And then, then virtually, you know, her and her friends, "Well, Miss Jill, just get over it" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "It's no big deal".  All the girls that she hung around with did the same thing.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, it w- I knew, you know, it was peer pressure because that wasn't her, but the whole point is, you know, it -- like I was trying to tell her, she had a job, yes.  She was making her own money, yes, because I taught them that and I taught them responsibility and values, you know, things like that.  But the point was that she wasn't capable of handling her college, her job and that baby.  And I knew that.  And I asked, her, I said, "Do you want to come live with me?" "No."  Well, see, momma -- momma didn't let her do a lot of things that daddy did.  And the morals weren't -- his morals are partying and drinking and, you know, whatever goes, that's fine.
R:  Mm.
L:  Just hang loose, Jill, you're too tight.  And I look at him, I said, "We'll never get along" I said, "That's it", you know, sixteen years of this mess is enough.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I said, "No way am I" -- you know, when the moral value of virtually the marriage was gone in the sense of there was other women and -- and beating me and the kids and then we had lost a son when he was fifteen and a half, when I first walked out of the house and said, "I'm going to get a divorce" I presumed my children would come with me.  Because they would have a better atmosphere and quiet and everything else.  N-n.  "Daddy gives us hundred dollar bills.  You're -- you're poverty."
R:  Oh.
L:  I said, "What do you mean?" I said, "I can feed you, I can clothe you" "You are poverty, you don't have nothing".
R:  Wow.
L:  I mean, daddy -- then -- then when he -- when the divorce was over with, guess what?  He had -- he had his wife that he has now, girlfriend, firstly she was living with him.  She didn't feed 'em, she treated 'em hatefully.  She even gave my daughter drugs to OD on.
R:  Mm.
L:  Suicide.  She -- and guess who she called.  Mom.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Mom.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mom.  Wouldn't speak to mother for three years.  Mom.  "Mom, come see me".  Locked up in a hospital.
R:  Oh, your poor kids.  Wow.
L:  No, God just took me through it and my husband -- I had been praying a week.  I didn't know who I was praying for, nothing else, I was praying away, doing my work and everything else and my godmother called me.  She said, "Sis, I want you to sit down".  I said, "Okay, what is it?"  She said, "It's Rach".  I said, "What's happened?" and I wasn't upset or nothing.  It was just like the Lord had prepared me the week ahead of time, you know.  She said, "She's ODd"  I said, "You're joking."  She said, "No."  I said, "She had had Kirsten" -- see, that was my oldest granddaughter and I thought maybe it was because of that.  N-n.  No.  Something else.  And virtually her stepmother handed her a bottle of um tranquilizers.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then my husband -- I had been telling him, my ex husband, but, you know, the moral value wasn't there.  But guess what -- guess what happened, though?  Mom, mom knows what to do.  Mom knows how to handle it.  These people don't know what to do.  I got myself in trouble one more time.  But mom [PAUSE] call mom.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  I d- I -- I was halfway up the State, I had moved from -- from here and moved up the State, middle of the State.  Then she got mad at me.  Everybody was there, I had told her, I said, "I'm going to go pick up Jimmy" my -- my second husband and I said, "I'll be there as soon as we can get there, but" I said, "It's a two hour drive".  "Okay, mom".  When we got there, Brenda was there, my ex husband was there, my son was there.  All her girlfriends that, you know, in Court, you know, the -- the loose values where the parents didn't care, nothing else, and I walked in and it's like, "What are you doing here?" [MN]
R:  Mm.  This is after she'd called you?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  And -- and I had to go through the -- the locked doors and search and everything else to make sure that there was nothing that could harm her and who I was and everything else and they're sitting laughing and having a good time.  And this woman is sitting next to her, well my baby.  And she's the one that handed her the bottle of pills.
R:  Wow.
L:  Jimmy looked at me, he grabbed me.  I said, "Lord, forgive me, but" I said, "I -- I could strangle her right here in the hospital.  They could take her to the morgue and we'll be through with it."  But you know what happened?  I shut my mouth, I didn't say a word.  I sat down and I went to shaking and I said --something was said and I looked over at my ex husband -- because Brenda was smarting off and everything else and she was high as a kite, he looked at Brenda, he said, "Come on, let's go".  She said, "I'm not leaving Rach.  I'm spending the night."  He said, "Come on, let's go."  [inaudible] looked at me, he said, "Momma" he said, "If you need something, you call me, I'll be right out here."  I said, "Okay" I didn't think I'd need anything, you know.  Well, her girlfriend wouldn't leave.  I looked at her, I said, "Rach" I said, "Is there anything that we can do for you?" "No."  I said, "Well, why did you bother to call"
