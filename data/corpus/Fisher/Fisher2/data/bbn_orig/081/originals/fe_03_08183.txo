L:  Hi, [LAUGH] I'm Holly and I'm from [inaudible] area.
R:  Hi.  I'm Katy and I'm from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Have you gotten on any more of these calls?
L:  Yeah, I had one other one.  It was really interesting, actually.
R:  Yeah, that's what --
L:  [NOISE] --
R:  -- that's what -- I thought too.
L:  You too?
R:  Um, for the other one.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I -- and th- -- I've unfortunately gotten calls twice when I haven't been able to take them, but --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I've gotten so many calls and didn't realize it until I listened to my answering machine later [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm like, uh-oh.
R:  So --
L:  So --
R:  -- what do you think about the question?
L:  Okay.  Family values, do I think that the um divorce rate has affected me?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Probably um only because my parents are divorced --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I don't think that um [LIPSMACK] gosh, I don't know how I feel about that.  I don't think divorce is necessarily a bad thing as long as you know you're honest to the kids about it.  I'd rather have somebody get a divorce and be happy than have parents be absolutely miserable and then, you know, stay with somebody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just for the kids' sake.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  I just -- I guess --
L:  What about you?  What's your -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well, my situation is um my parents have been married for, well, it'll be thirty years in January --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but it hasn't always -- I know if it wasn't for my brother and I they would have prob- they would have divorced.  However, in retrospect, I think that it's okay because the circumstances made us a family again and so seeing it from that perspective, we were all kind of miserable for a while, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I know that my parents would be completely lost without each other, you know, they just wouldn't -- even though they drive each other completely nuts at time and I'm just like, "Oh, my goodness --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- why are they doing this?" --
L:  But --
R:  -- at the same time, you know, when thinking about it, especially now, I'm getting married in less than month so I'm thinking about it especially from, you know, how -- how am I going to handle this in the future since it's, you know, it's looming very soon not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not looming in a bad way, but, you know, just that the time is rapidly approaching and --
L:  You know, I guess I didn't give it much justice for thinking about it because, um, you're right, you've a very important point that you just made and it's, you know, your parents kinda stuck it out and ah stayed with each other.  There are a lot of people that get divorced without trying that hard and I definitely think that you need to try very, very hard and um you know you're -- you're getting married in a month.  I got married last year and I know that um not -- there are lots of times where things aren't a whole lot of fun, but if you try to talk things out, you know, the rewards are just a lot greater than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than not.
R:  Well --
L:  So --
R:  -- and it's interesting, too, I don't know about your husband, but my fiance's parents are divorced and he said to me not that long ago, "I could never see my parents together now" you know, that -- it -- and it happened when he was a sophomore in high school and we've been out of college a couple of years now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um and so I don't know, you know, I mean it's interesting to hear him say that.  They're -- his dad has remarried and his mom is seeing someone seriously now but it's -- it's interesting, you know, that their way changes your perspective.  I know that in his case it, you know, he wanted to stress how important it was for us to make sure that this was the right thing because we don't want to take it seriously and we both want to be committed for life to it.
L:  Right.  I don't think anybody ever gets married thinking that, you know, well, if it doesn't work out, I'll just get a divorce.  Like most people, well, I don't know about most people, but most people that I know ah really do try hard.  But, you know, it's interesting because I -- I hadn't thought about this either, but I should have said something.  It did affect me in a way because a long time ago -- I'm -- I'm in my thirties, I'm thirty two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I got married a little bit later but when I was about twenty one or twenty two, my view on marriage was that I would get married to somebody and then they would cheat on me and we would get divorced.  And then I just thought that would happen, because that's what had happened --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to my -- in my parents' marriage.  And it took a long time for me to -- to feel like the -- my husband now, I totally trust him, we have a very good friendship, relationship, everything, but it's -- I'm looking at myself now and I'm looking at myself then, thinking, "Well, you know, if you had married the person you were with when you were twenty one, then maybe you would have picked somebody like your Dad" you know, so yeah I guess divorce does --
R:  Isn't that interesting, too?
L:  Yeah.  It is interesting.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  I guess divorce does affect us.  Whatever we see our parents do, we kind of maybe mould our expectations.  I -- I guess I thought earlier in life that since my parents couldn't make it then maybe many marriages couldn't make it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's not always acce- --
R:  Well -- b- in my family, in my -- in my extended family we have a lot of divorces, I think, relative to a lot of families, but at the same time like my grandparents have been married for sixty five years, my parents for thirty --
L:  Sixty five, wow.
R:  -- we have another marriage that -- mm.  Another forty five in -- in my aunt and uncle, you know, so it's like we h- we kind of have this dichotomy of short relationships and long ones, but, you know, so I think part of me was always very scared of e- I don't know where it came from about being cheated on, but --
L:  You too?
R:  -- you know, just because I knew that my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my own -- I know that -- of my own dedication and I can be sure of that, but I always -- that's one of my biggest fears --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and even though now I'm --
L:  Too [LAUGH].
R:  -- completely trust John, and, you know, I -- you know, I -- I do -- I would never think that he would ever cheat on me -- and I feel completely assured about that --
L:  Sometimes you just know.
R:  -- I think it's still, you know, I mean it's still up until very recently it was something I feared.
L:  Right.  I totally understand where you're coming from because that -- that used to govern like, you know, it used to always be in the back of my mind that ah it was going to happen just sooner or later and now I don't worry about it at all.  But um, it feels good to -- to know that even if there are bad times he's not going to run out and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- look somewhere else.  But an old boyfr- you know, a couple of boyfriends that I dated would have.  And probably did. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm glad that you found someone that -- like that too, you know, and that's -- and I think -- I personally think that once we can see those things in our parents, we're not going to repeat -- at least to the same degree, the mistakes that they did.  And I --
L:  Yeah, I think you're right--
R:  -- and I think --
L:  -- this is --
R:  -- make our own minds better, you know.
L:  Yeah.  That's really -- that's pretty valuable, what you've just said.  It's true --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess it's so important to pay attention.  It's kind of like the value of reading history textbooks and learning about history the same ah why is that valuable also for -- so we don't repeat it and also if we learn from our parents and look insides of ourselves then we won't repeat our parents' history.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean th- I don't think your parents' history was the same as mine, but um it's always good to learn from other people the best we can.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  And I think that it's placed an even higher value on preparing to be married to each other, in my case, um, because we know what the results are if it doesn't work out for a while or if it doesn't work out permanently --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Was it a surprise when he proposed to you?  I always like hearing stories like that.
R:  [LAUGH] It was, actually because we had actually spent a couple of days talking about it and like trying to -- we were in -- we lived in Madison and met in Madison and um we have a jeweler in my family so we were going to go get it from the jewelry store in Milwaukee and he wanted to be very proper and ask my parents and things like that, um --
L:  Oh, it's so romantic, I love that [LAUGH].
R:  -- so, we talked about doing all of these things for a while but then it just wasn't working out for him to take my parents out and to get to the jeweler and my mom said over the phone, um, you know, "My answer is yes" even though he hadn't asked the question --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because we'd been talking about it, we just -- but then he's like, "Well, let's just ..." you know, since we were -- our plans got changed, he's like, "Let's just go wild and have a really time and enjoy one last, you know, meal that we can afford" -- because he's going to law school and um --
L:  I understand, yeah.
R:  -- he actually proposed to me -- he proposed to me after dinner.  So, it was -- it was definitely --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a surprise in that way.
L:  I bet everybody in the restaurant --
R:  But it was a lot of fun.
L:  -- was -- everybody in the restaurant probably was like, "Oh, how sweet" [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I don't know.  The waitress was definitely very disconcerted because I just started bawling right away --
L:  [LAUGH] She probably was like --
R:  And -- and she --
L:  -- "Is the food okay?" --
R:  -- she came and asked if we wanted -- wanted to see the dessert menu and -- and my fiance was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, "Yeah, definitely" and when she came back --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "You be the first to know that we got engaged."  And she was like, "Oh, good.  I thought either something really bad had happened or something --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- good"
L:  [LAUGH] She wasn't sure, oh that's so funny [LAUGH].
R:  How did you -- how were you proposed to?
L:  Oh, this is -- this is going to sound really strange, but um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my -- my husband he bought one of those giant Easter eggs and he --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- h- he hollowed out like a little hole in it and it wasn't even Easter time and I don't even know where he -- I -- it was probably like a month beforehand, so they were selling the things --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but it wasn't exactly Easter.  And we're -- we're Jewish, although we're not religious, so it doesn't really make a lot of sense [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- anyway, so he hollowed out the Easter egg and he put lots of little Easter eggs inside the big giant one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and in each Easter egg he put a candy bar.  And then he hid it in my closet and ah he did it the night that we happened to have had a -- a blackout, so like there were no lights on in the house and we were running around with flashlights --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I go upstairs and I'm like putting my clothes away for bed and I'm like, "God I'm a slob, what -- what's that stuff in the bottom of my closet?" because I try to keep really clean, I'm like, "Why's all that stuff there? What is that?"
R:  Oh no [LAUGH].
L:  And I look -- I look at it closely and I'm like, "It's a giant egg, oh my God" so I -- I go and I dump it out and I'm squealing with delight and I come and I -- I called for him ah -- we had company over, but the company was -- I guess he told them what was happening, so they stayed downstairs h- --
R:  Oh [LAUGH]
L:  -- in the blackout house, not -- like doing nothing, not watching TV or anything, um, so I started opening all the chocolate, you know, I'm like, "Wow, they're my favorite Snickers, this that, chocolate Cadbury eggs" and there was a little ring in one of them.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, it was like really -- it was a totally surprise because we hadn't been talking about it.  We hadn't -- like we had talked about it before, like a couple of years earlier -- we were dating for a long time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but we hadn't talked about it in a while, so that's why it was a total surprise.
