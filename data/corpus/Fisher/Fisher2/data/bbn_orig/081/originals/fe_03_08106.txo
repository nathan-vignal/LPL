L:  -- the main thing around here.
R:  That's good.  I just like -- I don't really have any hobbies, I just go to the gym mostly.
L:  Y- yeah --
R:  That's, like, my ho- --
L:  -- that could be considered a hobby, for sure.
R:  Yeah, that's, like, my only real hobby, I guess.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so why do you hike? [LAUGH]
L:  It's physical.  Uh, I really -- we -- the mountains aren't too far, so we go hiking a lot on the trails in the mountains --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- either go up to the lake or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I like to hike with my girls a lot, so --
R:  Oh, you have kids?
L:  -- we go.  Yeah, I have two daughters, so --
R:  Oh, okay, cool.  Yeah, I've been hiking when I was younger, but not for a long time.
L:  And it's a good -- it's a good, cheap family activity, so --
R:  Gotcha.
L:  -- and I have -- my other hobby might be the computer, if that's a hobby --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- playing games, so --
R:  Or playing, like, online and stuff?
L:  Yeah, I do play, I like to play a lot of cribbage online.

R:  Um, I just -- I don't know, all I do is go to gym, like maybe -- like an hour or two a day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's basically --
L:  Every day you like to go then, huh?
R:  Well, not every day.
L:  M- maybe?
R:  But, like, three day -- times a week.
L:  Three days a week?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you go to school, or do you like to go before school or afterwards?

L:  Uh, I'm a carpenter and, [SIGH] actually, I'm going to go some work up in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, so I'll be able to do [NOISE] quite a bit of hiking.
R:  That's good.
L:  It's a real beautiful place with lots of hiking spots --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's really more of a skiing place, but --
R:  Isn't that far -- is that far from where you live?

R:  Like, you -- you travel that far for a job?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Sometimes.
R:  That's good. [MN]
L:  And usually stay out on the job for a couple of weeks, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I should --
R:  Um --
L:  -- be able to get some of my hobbies in while I'm there.
R:  That's good.  You like to fish, you said?
L:  Yes, and I like to fish too.
R:  That's good.
L:  And camping --

R:  Yeah.
L:  -- figured out.
R:  You can actually go online and try to match yourself [LAUGH] -- match dot com.
L:  Yeah, I've tried that too.
R:  You have?
L:  Yeah, it's good and bad --
R:  It didn't work out?
L:  -- so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, are there -- are there crazy people on there?
L:  Yeah, not crazy.  I've never met crazy psycho killers but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but you meet some --
R:  Interesting?
L:  -- some odd ones.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  You have to -- have to be careful.
R:  I never tried that.  I don't plan on it right now, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I don't consider that my project car [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or hobby car.
R:  That's good.
L:  That's my reliable car.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  The other ones, which are money pits, which it's -- would be hobby c- -- hobby cars and I guess most hobbies are money pits, aren't they?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  As --
R:  Except for hiking.
L:  Mm, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, true, that's -- that's why I like that hobby, 'cause it's a cheap hobby.
