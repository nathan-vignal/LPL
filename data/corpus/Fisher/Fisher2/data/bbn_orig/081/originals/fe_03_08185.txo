R:  Hi, I'm Pamela.
L:  Hi, I'm Gabby.
R:  Hi Gabby.
L:  How's it going [LAUGH]?
R:  Good. [several inaudible words]
L:  This is my first call, so [LAUGH]
R:  It's a beautiful hot day here in sunny California.
L:  Yeah, I'm in Cali too.  So --
R:  Yeah, they gave me a different topic of the day than --
L:  Yeah the -- yeah.
R:  -- for this.  But -- so she said --
L:  What -- what -- what do you have?
R:  Well, she -- the first -- when I got on they said the topic of the day was family value -- maybe --
L:  Right.
R:  -- maybe it all tied in together.
L:  Oh, now it's divorce or something, right, the rising rate --
R:  Huh?
L:  Now it's something about divorce, right?
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  So [SIGH] ah I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think -- I think divorce um is -- is too easy for people to get today, but I think that people get married too easy, too [LAUGH].
L:  And for the wrong reasons, mostly security --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and um young --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some of them are way too young to um even realize what marriage really means --
R:  Exactly.  And they don't take the time to get to know each other.
L:  That's right.
R:  And I -- I was -- I was married when I was very young, I was only eighteen when I got married, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I was very mature for my age --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um my h- my ah ex husband and I just were -- we grew up, you know, as we grew older, we grew apart --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we -- we sincerely wanted different things in life and I think if people were to go through some of type of classes or training or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or even have a basic questionnaire that they have to answer before they get married, it would solve a lot of the divorce problem.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I agree.  I agree.  I was -- well, my first marriage was when I was seventeen, so I can relate [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And um, yeah, it wasn't too fun and we grew up, like you and I think that happens a lot, so --
R:  Yeah.  You know, I think --
L:  And maybe --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Maybe parents should, you know, be a little more open about, you know, talking about marriage and before you grow apart and not sugar coat everything so much, maybe.
R:  That would be a great idea.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I [inaudible] because the whole family is involved when it's, you know, when it comes down --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm amazed at all the people, they spend thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars on weddings and then, you know, six months later, or a year later, two years later, they're divorced and --
L:  Yeah.  I agree.
R:  -- um, I -- I don't think that that is going to inhibit me from getting married again when I meet the right person, though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, because I w- I -- I do plan to get married again --
L:  Really?  Mhm.
R:  -- and um -- but I will take the time to get to know the person and --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and ah you know, know what -- what they're all about before I make that commitment because I don't ever intend to be ma- to be divorced again.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I want it to be for life.
L:  Right.  Right.  I --
R:  I believe that --
L:  It took me -- it took me about five years to agree to another marriage.  I am currently married again, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it was different, it was very scary.
R:  So, you do you -- do you feel like the div- that the divorce rate would scare from you if you were, let's just say for example something God forbid would happen --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- do you think the divorce rate would -- would effect from you from making the decision to get married a third time?
L:  I wouldn't -- I would not get married a third time.  I --
R:  You would not?
L:  No.  Absolutely not.  I don't see anything wrong with it.  The reason I got married a second time was because I really wanted to have children --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I didn't have children with my first marriage, so um -- I plan on having kids and I plan on having my [inaudible] so God forbid if something does happen then I don't see another reason to get married again.
R:  Oh, very interesting.
L:  Yeah.  I don't either --
R:  So, it doesn't have anything to -- to do with the divorce -- divorce rate, it just --
L:  It -- it does --
R:  -- you don't --
L:  -- it does a little bit, but I also I don't really want to [inaudible] it again [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  And um I really don't need a piece of paper, you know, so --
R:  Ah.
L:  I can't do that really [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, okay.  I see.
L:  And that piece of paper's really not that important, it's -- it's more important that they're long and um I've discovered a freedom very important for me, um, if I say if I don't lose myself, in my first marriage I lost myself in it, lost all my friends and I really didn't like that, so --
R:  So, you --that divorce --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how did that affect your -- your family and your -- your value --
L:  Um --
R:  -- your -- the way people looked at you?
L:  Well, um, I got a lot of, "I told you so" because I was seventeen when I got married the first time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um and I moved and I grew up in Europe and then moved to United States for him, so a lot of people that was a mistake and then um, to tell you the truth, my extended family didn't know it for a long time that I'd gotten a divorce [LAUGH] I kept that under wraps --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- my mom -- yeah. [LAUGH] I was very embarrassed [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  Now, how long were you married the first time?
L:  Four years.
R:  Four years.  Okay.
L:  How about you?
R:  [MN] Well, I was married for nine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I've got two children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um -- and when I got divorced, I guess I was the f- I was the first one to get married in my family and the first one to get divorced --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and my family --
L:  -- no.
R:  -- and I have a very large family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um I actually think that made me closer to my family.
L:  Oh, that's nice, very good.
R:  Because, you know, they thought -- everybody sort of all pitched in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to help out and um and were good -- a good -- a good support team.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I d- I do believe um that the -- the ease of divorce has hurt --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the te- people don't -- people just don't try --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because it's just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- too easy to get a divorce, just go down and sign a piece of paper --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, basically no fault and [inaudible] good stuff, you know, it just makes it just way too easy to get divorced and people just give up too easy when they -- they -- if they worked at -- because I mean, my gosh, we do say these vows, you know, we do say --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "Until death do us part" and then it's just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like we forgot about those so [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  We -- we --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- forget about this -- those vows that we said --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, you know, good times and bad and then when -- and when the bad times come --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people run the other way.  I think that divorce is necessary sometimes, for example, if people are being abused --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it's something that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's -- it's a good thing because there's no reason for somebody to stay in an abusive relationship which is what I was in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um I -- by getting to know somebody for a long time and, you know, knowing what you want out of your life and sharing that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it can -- it can solve a lot of that problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before it even gets started.
L:  Very true.  Um, but also do you agree that people change throughout the years?
R:  Uh-huh.  Absolutely.
L:  And -- yeah.
R:  Which is one of the reasons why I think we should have to have an a- an age if we get married [LAUGH] to --
L:  Absolutely [LAUGH].
R:  -- because we -- we have time to grow and then we don't, you know, the d- again, the divorce is not something that's going to be as -- as easy with someone that you have for values with and you know, a life plan together with --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- and -- and I believe that, you know, that -- that the institution of marriage is something that God has given us as part of our -- our -- our -- our birthright --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's purpose for marriage and a -- and it's like you say, one of the reasons is -- is that we procreate --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah I think today so many people don't even bother to get married, even though they have kids or they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have kids first and then get married [MN] --
L:  Right.  Right.  And yeah.
R:  O- or they don't even, you know, it's like now -- nowadays it's so -- it's so affected that people just don't -- you know, they don't even think twice about it.
L:  Right.  Right.  Very true.  Very --
R:  And maybe and I -- and a lot of them use the -- the reason, you know, as the fact that, you know, they've watched parents go through divorce and how horrible it is and it -- because it was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was to go through a divorce.
L:  I agree.  I agree.
R:  Um, because I did -- I did [inaudible] very much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's really tough --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- being ah saying goodbye and admitting that it was a failure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of course you try to, because there are kids involved, you've got to try to ah remain mature adults and -- and get along for the kids' sake --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- and I think it does, and getting back to the -- to the family values thing, I think that it absolutely does, ah, affect um the -- the way our kids grow up and I'm like, you know, they watch their moms and dads get divorced and they think, "Hey, you know, this is -- marriage is not such a h- a -- a great thing after all because, you know, it -- it isn't" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It isn't forever, it isn't ti- till death do us part, so --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- we have --
L:  And I don't think marriage is for everyone, either, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think a lot of people, um, can be married, you know, and they shouldn't get married, um, [LAUGH] I was just [several inaudible words] um really a very dear friend of mine just got married and told me it would be [several inaudible words] "Well, you know, if it doesn't work, I can always get a divorce, right?" [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, my God.
R:  Mm.
L:  Maybe, it's not the, you know, best thing for you to do.
R:  And what do you think is the reason why, you know, today people I -- I -- I mean other than the fact that it's done so often, divorce is so prevalent, why do you think it is people don't try in marriages?  Do you think it is because it's just too easy, or what are your thoughts about that?
L:  I think it's our society.  I think women -- women have careers now.  They don't
