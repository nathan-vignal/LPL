R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  I'm okay.  I guess we're going to talk about family values and --
L:  I guess so.
R:  -- stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  I -- I didn't know that divorce had gone up.
L:  Well, actually, I had just because I -- I actually work for a d- divorce attorney.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's actually gone up in like thirty years or twenty years, or something?
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's --
R:  Who would think, because people used to get married much younger.
L:  Right.  Definitely and I think now the reason it is is even with, you know, people getting married much younger then, that was kind of their set -- set way and now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the reason people are getting married is usually to get out of their house, with their parents.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And so I've noticed a lot of times we actually have clients that come to us ritually, they -- they'll marry, divorce, marry, divorce --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- marry, divorce.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  And how old?
L:  Oh, goodness, I know [SIGH] I've only been in this like three or four years --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and but I -- I can tell just by looking at their files it starts at, you know, they probably married at twenty or so and then it just kind of went from there, you know, divorcing every five or so years.
R:  Oh my god.  I guess it's just an -- maybe it's too easy to get married.
L:  I guess so.  And -- and also, with all the -- the scapegoats people have, you get a pre nup --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and you just think you're safe.
R:  Yeah, people didn't used to get those things, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's like you're really not losing anything, it's just sort of like having a boyfriend or a girlfriend --
L:  Right.
R:  -- except you have a piece of paper so you get benefits and stuff like that and you're re- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's really -- it's very easy to get ah divorced and you don't really lose much, I guess.
L:  Right.  And you don't even have to have reasons now.  Many states you just --
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  -- you can just be separated for like, you know, thirty days or whatever and they say, "Oh, well that's irreconcilable differences and you can have a divorce".
R:  What's the difference between annulment and divorce?
L:  Annulment you can state that you've never been married.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, it's like a divorce or like the marriage never happened.
R:  Yeah, but who do you state it to?
L:  Um, you will go -- actually a judge has to annul it.
R:  Yeah, but it's like -- no, but I'm saying, what's it for?  It's like you don't normally you show somebody --
L:  Well.
R:  -- a piece of pa- anybody could say their married or not married.
L:  Right.  There's usually they -- they have limitations, like, you know --
R:  Or maybe it's a religious thing also.
L:  There are so like Catholics --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I notice a lot of Catholics you can only apparently not only but a lot of them will marry only into the Catholic religion --
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and they don't want someone who's been divorced --
R:  Right.  It might -- yeah.
L:  -- and so to marry in a Catholic church --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you have to -- you have to do that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, Gavin.  You lost your tooth.  Go away.
R:  Gavin lost his tooth?
L:  Yeah, we've been working with it for three days.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you've got good family l- family values there, I hope?
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes, I've been married for a year now.
R:  Oh, only a year?  How old are you, you're very young, then?
L:  I'm twenty -- I'm twenty four.
R:  Oh, you're a baby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm forty seven, or forty eight --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- something like that, yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  So, oh, for only a year.  Okay.  Well, I hope it lasts forever.
L:  Well, thank you.  Are you married?
R:  Um, live with someone for quite a long time --
L:  Really?
R:  -- um -- yeah.
L:  I did the same.
R:  F- for years and years and years and years and years and years.  So --
L:  Really?
R:  -- um, it's sort of like a marriage, I guess.  But we're not officially married.  Um, but it's -- it's worked.  It's worked for twenty five years, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah, it's quite -- it's worked quite well.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's what we -- we were going to do that for quite a while, I think we lived together for five years before we got married --
R:  So, it's the same thing, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the most important thing, to see if you guys can live together.
L:  Right.  And that's a big huge step, even just moving in together.
R:  Ah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- getting to know each other's habits and dealing with all the little stuff and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What was the other thing that we were supposed to talk -- if it's changed our views on marriage and if it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if it's changed, I can't think of what else they asked.
L:  I do remember if it changed our views on marriage, which yes it did on mine, definitely.
R:  R- e- --
L:  And I think that's why I waited so long.
R:  You mean, the eas- the easy divorce rate and stuff?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Really?  It really did change you?
L:  And it -- yeah.  Because it's so easy now and it just makes me wonder, you know --
R:  If it's the right relationship.
L:  Yeah.  And because you think, you know, used to be people would say, you know, "I want to get married because it's harder to walk away" no, it's not anymore --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- I- it's just like being boyfriend and girlfriend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if he wants to walk away, the only difference is he has to pay an attorney to walk away.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And so it's not that much different.
R:  Yeah.  It's interesting.  And things have totally, totally changed.  It's really unbelievable.
L:  Right.
R:  I guess when I was much younger, actually my mother was divorced -- she's not alive anymore, but my mother was divorced and she was born in nineteen thirteen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I guess she married when she was like twenty five or something like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um and it was totally scandalous back then, I mean you just simply didn't tell people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and even when I was growing up there was like a little shame to it.  Now, it's absolutely nothing at all.
L:  Right. There's no big deal.
R:  It's -- it's nothing.  It's perfectly acceptable.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  So, it is strange how -- how everything changes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah.  So, how old is your kid?
L:  He's five.
R:  Oh nice.  Very sweet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  A lot of work.
L:  It has been.  It's not been too awful bad because I was definitely blessed with a wonderful father for him.
R:  Yeah.  Oh.
L:  And ah so he's been --
R:  And that is a blessing, really.
L:  Definitely.  Because he's almost a mister mom.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Because I wanted to go to college and I wanted to do everything and that's hard because it was right a- right after high school that I had my baby --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that's, you -- it just kind of puts everything on hold and he helped that not happen.
R:  And because you were out of high school and weren't yet married --
L:  Right.
R:  -- this is like totally on the subject over here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what did your family think?
L:  They were actually, and you know, it's kind of run in my family the same thing --
R:  Oh really?  Oh, okay.
L:  -- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So it was perfectly acceptable, then
L:  Yeah, everything's happened -- right.  It's -- and it's --
R:  Great.  That's wonderful.
L:  -- just been that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the one that it didn't run in, I've had -- the other ones have been married about four or five times [LAUGH] so --
R:  W- oh, I see.  I see, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's wonderful and it's also wonderful for your child because he feels perfectly acceptable, like nothing's wrong.
L:  Right, yeah, he --
R:  So, that's wonderful.
L:  -- doesn't see anything different.
R:  That's -- and there is nothing different, so that's great.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Well, look, it sounds like a very accepting family and --
L:  It is.
R:  -- and like -- like you all do have great values --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so that's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where in Florida do you live?
L:  Um, I live in actually Arkansas.
R:  In Arkansas?  I thought you said Florida, I'm sorry.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, in Arkansas.  Oh, how nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it really hot there?
L:  Right now, it's not too bad.  It's only like ninety five or so.
R:  That's not too bad.
L:  No, no, actually it's not.
R:  Thank God.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At ninety five we're dying over here --
L:  Really?
R:  -- we're dying in New York --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's usually -- the heat index is much higher than ninety five.  I know here recently it's been the heat index is like a hundred and five to a hundred and ten --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and we have high humidity --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and so -- yeah.
R:  -- and it's always --
L:  It makes it worse.
R:  -- this way in the summer?
L:  Always.  Actually, this is a mild summer.
R:  Oh, I had no idea at all.
L:  Yeah.
R:  None.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh my god, how do you -- what are the winters like?
L:  The winters are either absolutely horrible, which just like the year before last we had a huge ice storm and so for a week it was nothing but ice everywhere --
R:  Oh.  Miserable.
L:  -- and -- yeah.  And then the next, you know, like a month later you're walking around in shorts.
R:  Oh.  Oh, how weird.
L:  Yeah.  It's really unpredictable.  You can't ever count your, you know, you say you'd get winter clothes, well our winter clothes are usually our summer clothes.
R:  Yeah.  And our, it's like w- it used to be very, very, very cold in the winter here in New York and all of a sudden it's just not, so it's like everybody's got all this major long underwear and fleece boots and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nobody ever wears the stuff anymore --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it's just not that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- yeah.
L:  I think it's like that everywhere.  I think it's just slowly been changing and evolving into something totally different.
R:  I think so as well.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I totally agree, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, um, okay, well, let's see.  What else do we talk about with marriage?  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  Probably the re- I guess we can talk about the reasons people get married --
R:  What are the reasons people get married? 
L:  Well, I've noticed it's --
R:  Well, for love, I hope.
L:  Yeah, and, you know what's sad, that's not really been it, r- you know that I've noticed like I said before, you know, people get married to get like if they're young, to get out of their parents' house.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And then I've noticed t- 
R:  Yeah, but they've always been doing that, even when I was a kid.
L:  Yeah.  And I think that was a little bit of mine, even though I didn't get married, I just moved in with him, that was my whole reasoning of going ahead and moving in --
R:  Well, I think that's so much smarter.
L:  -- [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Because you get to test it out.
L:  Right.  And I think so too.
R:  Although it's not ex- it's not necessarily -- now I guess it's acceptable, right?
L:  Right.
R:  To live together.  Yeah, when I was a kid, it wasn't acceptable to do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like you were just trash if you did stuff like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I did it anyway --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um and look, it's twenty six years later.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --yeah --
L:  Yeah.  And it's --
R:  So, I -- I think it's imp- it's a good way to get to know somebody without that stress of the commitment, this way you stay together if you want to stay together --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know and you make the -- you work, it's compromise and it's hard work, but um maybe we've lost discipline in the country, you know?
L:  I wonder.  Ah and I bet that's probably a lot of it.  And a lot of it, everybody wants choices now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when you marry, you really don't have a choice.
R:  No.
L:  It's just -- it's that way or, you know, those that maybe don't find divorce acceptable, you know, it's that way or no way.
R:  Yeah, but they're -- you're missing something when you don't learn how to compromise and you don't learn how to live with someone else and you don't learn how to -- I think compromise is such an important thing to learn.
L:  Right.
R:  Um and the only way to do that is by going through tough times and realizing that the -- the person is important to you and that you do want to stay together, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, I don't know.  Well, [PAUSE].
L:  Well, I've noticed that um a lot of times here recently -- especially round here and I guess in other places -- a lot of it's been when it comes to money, um, a w- either way, the men or the women, you know, they want to get married for the money, but they don't want to sign that pre nup.
R:  What do you -- um, the money, what do you mean the money?
L:  Like if the husband has --
R:  If -- if the husband has --
L:  -- a lot of money --
R:  -- more money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And even though it, you know, they may be in love, they also look at, "Well, I do kinda care for him, but he's going to be able to support me for the rest of my life".
R:  A lot of women are that way.
L:  Yeah.  And I -- and I think that's -- I think it's sad in some ways.  I guess it's smart in many because you know you'll be taken care of and -- and kids you'll have will be taken care of.  But would -- I would want
