R:  Hi, I'm Christine.
L:  Hi, I'm Michelle.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Good thank you.  Um --
L:  You sound young.
R:  Oh, I'm twenty five how are --
L:  Oh are you? [LAUGH]
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm thirty seven.  [inaudible]
R:  How old?
L:  Thirty seven.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you married?
R:  No, I'm not.  Um, I live with my boyfriend.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, I'm married and I have ah two ch- two -- um, kids.  Two children.
R:  Two children?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How old are they?
L:  Um, eleven and gonna be seven in about three weeks.
R:  Oh, that's great. 
L:  So, yeah, so, what do you think about the divorce rate, I guess that's what the thing said, the divorce rate?
R:  Divorce rate.
L:  And how it affects --
R:  Um, yeah, it asked if -- if um it influences my -- my -- I guess my views on marriage, the rise in divorce rate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess I have to say no, it doesn't because I think a lot of people rush into marriage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and maybe get married for the wrong reasons or, I don't know, I mean um I think part of the reason why I live with my boyfriend is to see if we're compatible, which I know they say that -- that, you know, living together r- like kind of raises the percentage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of divorce rate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but um I -- I don't think for us and I -- I don't think in our case that'll be true because I mean I -- I want to know if I'm completely compatible with someone before I actually marry him.
L:  Sure.
R:  What do you think?
L:  Um, I think like you said, it depends on the people --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and where they both are and what their intentions are and I think people don't realize that marriage is a lot of work --
R:  Exactly.  Work.  Yeah.  They expect it to be kind of like, "Okay, we're committed now, so everything will kind of be like, you know --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- a fantasy, like happily ever after" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's not.  You constantly have to work at it.  And --
L:  Well, I think that um -- I think that the divorce rate is sad, I think that people, once you make a commitment, you should try your hardest to really keep it.  I know there's sometimes extenuating circumstances, but I know it hurts children really bad.  My parents got a divorce when I was young --
R:  Really?
L:  -- yeah and so I think --
R:  My parents n- 
L:  -- that -- I think that people should just take it more seriously.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  I think people look into it like -- they go into it saying, "Well, if it doesn't work, we can just get a divorce".
R:  You know, maybe if the divorce laws were a little less lenient --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people wouldn't -- wouldn't see it like that, maybe they'd think twice before getting married, thinking well, you know, this isn't just like, "Oh well, if this doesn't work out, we'll get a divorce".
L:  Exactly.  I think a lot of people think that feeling's not going to go away and -- and instead of love really it to me isn't a feeling, it's a commitment that two people -- you make a commitment, you're not going to like that person everyday, which I'm sure you've experienced that even just living with him --
R:  Exactly.  Yes.  I have.
L:  -- but it comes back, I mean you just -- I don't know, my sister got married um -- the guy who married her said, instead of when you get married looking like you have this treasure chest and it's full of stuff and everytime something bad happens you take something out of it --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, and -- but then, before you know it, it's empty.  Instead of looking at it like it's full when you get married, look at it like it's empty and keep trying to put stuff in it.
R:  Yeah, you're right.
L:  And I just thought that was so cool, it's like that's really what you should do.
R:  Wow, that's really cool.  That is.
L:  And that way, you know, you have substance to fall back on.  It's hard.  My husband and I got married very fast and --
R:  Was there a reason for that?
L:  -- we've had a rough --
R:  Or --
L:  -- a rough time, so but I mean I think we have normal problems and you think -- you see couples and we're real active in our church and you see couples there and you think everyone, like they're so happy, the way they look, but everybody has problems --
R:  Yeah.  That's right.
L:  -- you know and you start talking to your girlfriends and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just think it's hard on kids.  I think it's not a good example for children.
R:  I know.  Once you have children, I think, you know, also the rules change, you know --
L:  Yeah.  You should really try because it hurts 'em.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, before you have kids, it's -- it's easier to cut the ties, but once you do have children, you bring children into that relationship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you really have to consider those children because you brought those children into the world and they -- their needs go before yours, I think.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And it's like, okay, you might be unhappy but, you know what, for the sake of those kids, you should try to make it work.  I'm not saying that you should stay together no matter what, just for the kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but those kids should definitely be an incentive in --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- making things work.
L:  That should be a big part of your decision.  I think that -- I think some States -- well, I know in Texas they --
R:  Is that where you're from?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's cool, what part?
L:  I know they have -- huh?
R:  What part of Texas?
L:  Um, I'm in Lake City, which is down by Galveston, it's in between Galveston and Houston --
R:  Oh, wow.  That's cool.  You're across the country from me, I'm --
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, cool.  Oh, I've never been there.  I've always wanted to go there.
R:  Really?
L:  I want to go -- I want to go so bad.
R:  You know, it's so funny because I still want to get out of here.  I still want to live in a small town --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but -- I am so sick of this city.  I just want to get out of here.  You know, you've probably heard about the Mayor and every -- but you know what, we're getting off the topic [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  I was going to say, are you born, you don't sound like you were born there?
R:  Yeah, I was.
L:  You were?
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't have a [inaudible] accent or anything [LAUGH].
L:  No, you don't have that nasal ...  Well, I think that --
R:  And not everyone here talks like that [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was going to say that in Texas you file for divorce and then you have to wait sixty days, you can't get it right then --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and then you -- and then if you have children you have to both take a class before it's finalized, it's kind of a new thing they have here.
R:  What do they teach in the class?
L:  Um, just what it's going to do to the kids and -- and stuff like that.  It's hopefully, you know, and the things you can work out and I think they ought to have like mandatory, you know, mediation or something for couples to go to and try to work it out, but I think a lot of marriages end today based on affairs outside of the marriage.
R:  That's true.  That -- that's --
L:  I think ah -- as much women as men, I think that -- because I think that really hurts a marriage, I really think it hurts someone.
R:  You know, I -- ah -- I don't know why people just can't kind of keep the fantasy and reality separate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I totally understand you've been together for a while, you know, you're going to fantasize about other people.  Why make it reality, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, can't you just kind of live that out in your fantasy life?  I mean, I [several inaudible words] thing like if -- if I want other people other than you, why am I going to make this lifetime commitment?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  I -- why do people do it, why do you -- why do you think they do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then later on do stray?
L:  Mhm.
R:  What's your opinion on that?
L:  I think that um [NOISE] I think men are more hormonal than -- I mean more sexual than -- than it's a need that they have --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- to have met, you know, it's just they're built that way.  And women too, but women as you get older, you'll see your cycle, you know, changes Mommy, honey I'm on the phone, hang up right away okay I'll be up there in a minute.  I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, that was so sweet.
L:  The dogs are barking and it scares them when the dogs bark --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because they're upstairs and I'm down here.  Um, but I think that -- and then when there's problems, you know, women, we're emotional, we want -- y'all quit barking -- we want um, you know, to be happy before we, you know, do that --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and men, they don't -- you could fight for an hour and then they're like ready, they don't care.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, to have um relations with you, so I think that if a woman, you know, I think that's where it starts is you grow apart in that area and then, you know, you meet someone who acts like they really care and they really know you and -- I guess, you know -- and then --
R:  Gives them that attention, that intimate kind of like, not intimate as in sexually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but intimate as in attention like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- listening to you and caring about you --
L:  And they haven't had those feelings for a long time --
R:  Yeah.  That's -- and -- and you know, men basically it's like something in a short skirt will turn their heads, so [SIGH].  It's really --
L:  Well, I think that um [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] that men um and women should just chill out and not think it's so easy because I think that society has made divorce easy.
R:  Exactly.  I agree with you.
L:  I mean, I have um friends that their husbands have left them for other women and it's -- it's just devastating to that woman and to the children and it's just a horrible thing.
R:  You know, see, what I don't understand is how a man can be with a woman and make that commitment to her, marry her, have -- bring children into the world with her and then leave her for another woman.  I mean, what is going through this man's mind?
L:  I don't understand how s- a woman can be the other woman, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- knowing that he did that --
R:  Knowing.  Knowing that he has children, that he has a wife.  I am just -- it's just -- it makes you think, this world is just crazy, completely crazy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where -- where are values, you know, where are the morals?  I -- I don't know.
L:  I think it's just become too easy.  I mean, I hear of people who have had two and three and four marriages, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but there are, I mean I know a lot of couples who have stayed together for a lot of years, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for --
R:  My parents, they've been married for -- I don't know -- thirty, thirty one years --
L:  Well, that's awesome.
R:  -- they're still together.  I mean, they've had their hard times.  They've had their ups and downs.  They've had their -- you know, they never actually separated, but there were times when they were about to, but they've worked it out.  You know.  And I think that's great.  I think that, you know, having my parents you know have that kind of relationship has kind of given me sort of like, okay well, I -- I want that too, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like if -- if I have problems in my marriage, if -- if it gets really hard, you know, I'll think about them, I'll be like, you know, if they could work it out, I could work it out too.
L:  Mhm.  And your boyfriend, what about his p- family?
R:  Oh, it's totally different.  Yeah.  His -- his mother left when he was young and he was basically raised just by his father and I think he -- he doesn't really um -- he's not as open or accepting to marriage as I am.  I think I want it more than he does.
L:  Yeah.  Well, he's -- how -- is he your age?
R:  Um, he's five years older than -- he's thirty.
L:  Yeah, he's still young.
