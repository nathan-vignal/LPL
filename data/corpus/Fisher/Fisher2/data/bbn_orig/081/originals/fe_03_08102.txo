L:  [NOISE] I'm sitting here watching TV.
R:  I'm on the internet --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- talking to friends.
L:  I'm on the internet a lot.  It's, like, one of my favorite things to do. [LAUGH] I'm probably on there [MN] twenty four seven. [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  My mom gets on it a lot so when she's gone I can get on.
L:  That's cool. [PAUSE]
R:  Did you have to listen to that music?

R:  [NOISE] You keep on doing that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I do that a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  I'm halfway watching TV and halfway not and ... tired and don't feel good.
R:  You have a hobby or not really?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you have a hobby or not really?
L:  Um, well, pretty much, just writing.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause I do a lot of poetry and stories and stuff like that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, that's, pretty much, my main thing. [PAUSE] I do it quite a bit.
R:  You like it ever since you were a kid?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I got into writing when I was ... probably in sixth grade -- [PAUSE] in the sixth grade.
R:  I used to write a lot but not any more. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I enter contests and things like that.  I won a two year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- scholarship --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a poem I wrote.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [PAUSE] You go to college?
L:  I'm going to be soon.
R:  Where at? [NOISE]
L:  I'm not sure yet.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I haven't quite figured that out yet.
R:  [LAUGH] My brother's going to college.
L:  That's cool. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] I think my hobbies are, pretty much, music and swimming.
L:  Swimming. [LAUGH] That works. [LAUGH] That's always fun.
R:  We have a pool friend[?] on --
L:  I haven't done that in a long time.
R:  You have a pool?
L:  Huh uh.
R:  I have a pool.
L:  I need one.
R:  It's hot.
L:  Yeah.  It's, like -- it feels, like, it's, like, a hundred degrees today but it's only, like, ninety something.
R:  It is a hundred over here.
L:  Pretty much the only hobbies that I have that I do a lot are writing and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going to the lake and stuff but I don't know if that can be counted as a hobby.
R:  You have a lake?
L:  Well, there's a lake not far from where I live.  I go out there whenever I can drive boyfriend.
R:  You have a boyfriend?
L:  Unfortunately. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not allowed to.
L:  Why not? [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause my parents don't want me to.
L:  [NOISE] A- -- so --
R:  But I've had one for four years. [LAUGH]
L:  That's cool. [LAUGH]
R:  And they still don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.  Yeah.  I was with a guy f- -- ah --
R:  Mysteries, you know? [LAUGH]

L:  Yeah.  How old do they want you to be before --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can date?
R:  I think they're gonna start letting me since I'm gonna be in high school.
L:  Yeah.  You'll be a freshman?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I remember my freshman year but I was fooling[?] --
R:  Was it fun or ...?
L:  Well, [NOISE] it can be.  It's rough adjusting to a new school. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] My brother went to this one so I'm really happy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I'm doing summer school and, like, I wanted to sit the class and they weren't gonna let anybody else but they're, like, "This is Andrew's sister".  They're, like, "Oh, okay, she can change".  So, I'm, like, [NOISE] "Yeah". [LAUGH]
L:  Y- -- that's cool.
R:  I, [NOISE] kind of, like school. [NOISE]
L:  I hated school.
R:  So, I guess a hobby can, kinda, be school. [LAUGH]
L:  Kind of.  That would work.  Well, I have another one but I don't do it as much anymore -- I love taking pictures and I got into a -- I was doing black and white photos and all that.
