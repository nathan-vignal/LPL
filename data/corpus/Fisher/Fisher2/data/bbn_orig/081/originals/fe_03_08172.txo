L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name's Cheryl.
R:  Hi, Cheryl.  And where are you from?
L:  I'm from North Western Pennsylvania.
R:  Hi.  My name is Rita and I'm near Dayton, Ohio.
L:  Oh, well, we're not too far apart then.
R:  Not really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I guess we're talking about family values today.
L:  [NOISE] I guess so.
R:  Um and the divorce rate and how oh dear, what was that second thing she said? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, how it affected your view on ah um the sanctity of marriage or something of that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the sanctions of marriage.
R:  I'm not really sure what they mean, but I really don't think that a lot of people are really willing to work things out --
L:  Oh, you know, s- yeah, come and go, you know, depends on who it is, I guess, some do and --
R:  Well --
L:  -- some don't and some try and [LAUGH].
R:  It also depends on what's going on, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean there --
L:  Are you married?
R:  Am I married?  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My husband's deceased, I married a second time.  And you?
L:  I w- I'm divorced.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I was married for fourteen years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um and it certainly changed my view.  I stayed in that marriage for fourteen years because I was raised in the church and believed that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you got married and you got married for life --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um but, seven affairs in seven years and --
R:  Exactly, some --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- some things you don't have to tolerate.
L:  Right.  And ah my husband had this habit of going for a pack of cigarettes and disappearing for three days or three weeks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or three months and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then he ah left in the middle of the night one night and --
R:  So, he made the decision for you?
L:  Pretty much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- pretty much, I mean when it came down to it, I was the one who filed, but [SIGH] um there was just no more, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just couldn't take it anymore.  That was in nineteen ninety eight --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um my views changed considerably [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I'm sure.
L:  I was really, really down on men for a while --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I didn't even ah date until nearly two years after our divorce --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Well --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- things like that, and alcohol, I think, you know, are justifiable but ah some of them get divorced just on whims, I mean they just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really don't want to -- they think that's an easy way out.
L:  Ah, yeah, as a matter of fact, um, a good friend of my family's, um, who did a lot of -- I hired him to do a lot of work on my house, he's like a jack of all trades, after my divorce --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ah he house sat for me and him and his little girl and ah he ah when I -- while I went on vacation with my parents and my children and I came back and he'd gotten me a dozen roses and -- and I was, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, you know, you're a really good friend, but I don't think of you that way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I never could.  He's on his sixth marriage.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  Sixth marriage and -- six marriages and five kids later.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think he finally found the right woman this time [LAUGH] but --
R:  Well, I'm glad.
L:  -- but and, you know, I mean it was just like, I don't know, these women just couldn't accept him for who he was, I guess.  He was a really nice guy and they'd just take advantage of him.
R:  Huh.  Too nice, maybe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  You know.  And ah I mean he'd -- his fourth wife, he and his fourth wife got divor- no, third wife, got divorced and then he got remarried, she got remarried then they both got divorced and then they lived together for like four years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um she left him for another man.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he is, he's just an extremely nice, polite guy but he's one of these guys who doesn't care to hold down a regular job --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not that he's ever -- you know, he's never failed to support his family, but he prefers to work for himself and if that's putting in windows --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at somebody's house today and fixing somebody else's television tomorrow, you know, and each t- I mean, and each one of his wives took him for everything he had --
R:  Darn.
L:  -- so even --
R:  Are you Catholic?
L:  No, I'm not.  I'm Baptist, actually.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if I was c- I'm not either.  Um, but if I was Catholic I may have a different view as well because, you know, it is such a terrible thing in the Catholic church.
L:  Well, in -- in the Baptist religion it's okay to get divorced --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's not okay to ever have another relationship with the opposite sex.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it's almost as --
L:  So, I'm sort of -- I'm sort of going against my religion --
R:  -- that's almost as bad as Catholic, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the Catholic religion you're just supposed to, you know, you made your bed, lie in it, take the abuse or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but according to scriptures in the bible, there are viable reasons for um divorce --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and those reasons are that your husband turns from God --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or your spouse, or that they cheat on you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ah -- but you're not ever supposed to have another relationship as long as they live.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, you don't know how many times in two years I wished my husband would die [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah?
L:  You know, my ex husband.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Many -- many times prior to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- our divorce [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Well, in the Baptist religion are they all the same way or ...?
L:  No, they're just like um --
R:  Certain --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- I mean because --
L:  -- it dep- --
R:  -- I have a cousin that's Baptist, they're very strong in the church.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She was Catholic and she married a fellow that's Baptist and they're very active in the church, so --
L:  Well, you know, some are stricter than others --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I mean like there's a Baptist church in Eerie, Pennsylvania --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I could go there and get married today --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but never in my --
R:  But your own church you couldn't?
L:  -- own church.
R:  Really?
L:  No.  Oh, no.  As a matter of fact, I didn't get married in my own church the first time.
R:  So, the --
L:  For the simple fact that my mother told the pastor that she and my father did not want me to marry my husband --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and because I was not abiding by my parents' wishes, he refused to marry me.
R:  Hm.  Interesting.
L:  Yeah, he refused to ah carry the ceremony.
R:  Must be a very strict Baptist.
L:  Well, not really.  I mean --
R:  No?
L:  -- you know, they dress like everybody else and ah but just, you know, certain things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, they -- I've never felt like anybody in the church looked down their nose at me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, you know, it's -- it's like going home to family every time I go to church --
R:  Huh.  Are --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- what about dancing and playing cards and this sort of thing?
L:  Um, card games are okay.  Not like poker, not gambling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but dancing, ah we really, I mean we don't really dance.  We don't have like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- chur- dancer at our church --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, we don't have yard sales or anything like that.  Any kind of fundraisers, that's strictly forbidden.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so that's ah you know --
R:  We go to a Methodist Church, but it's a very ah oh, upbeat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's almost like one of those services you see on TV.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And um they have a big youth center for the youth and they have dances and things that go on there all the time for the youth and it's just, you know, really upbeat and the music is, you know how a lot of churches are getting today and they --
L:  Oh, with the ro- christian rock?
R:  -- yeah, and they've been that way for years, but there's a lot of others that way now too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, my cousins used to ah go to christian rock concerts a lot.  My mom --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- would never let me go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But um --
R:  But I w- I don't know whether it's rock or not, would you call that da- [inaudible] christian rock? [NOISE] Oh, he supposes, [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  But, you know, it's really strange because I got married in a very strict Wesleyan Methodist Church --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is where my husband I got married.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And ah I mean, these people don't wear any jewelry other than a watch.
R:  Really?
L:  No wedding bands.  We couldn't have a ring ceremony.
R:  Oh.
L:  They have no televisions in their homes and the women wear dresses twenty four seven.
R:  And this is Methodist?
L:  Wesleyan Methodist.
R:  We- oh, lot of difference.
L:  They always have their hair up in buns --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they're never allowed to have their hair down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're not allowed to wear makeup or any kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- showy barrettes.
R:  They wear their hair a really different, don't they?
L:  Yeah, well, yeah, old style like --
R:  Kind of like a roll around the back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And but ah --
R:  We h- 
L:  -- they ah -- you know, they don't -- but they allowed my husband and I to get married in their church.
R:  Hm.
L:  I mean, [LAUGH] --
R:  It's hard to figure, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  Because that was his hometown --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he went to church there as a kid, so they allowed it.
R:  Huh.
L:  And I -- yeah, I found it very different.  As a matter of fact, the pastor later told me that we were the first couple that he ever married that got divorced.
R:  Uh.
L:  He was sure we would make it.
R:  R- just bec-
