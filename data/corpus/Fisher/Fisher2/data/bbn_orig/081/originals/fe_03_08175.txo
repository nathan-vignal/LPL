R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this Jamie.
R:  Hi, this is Fay.
L:  Hi Fay.  Glad to ah get to talk to you today.
R:  [LAUGH] It's always, you know, you never who -- know who you're going to talk to.
L:  That's true.  So, we're talking about divorce today?
R:  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.
L:  Uh-huh.  And if -- if the high rate of divorce has ah in -- ah -- changed our -- the way we look at marriage, did you understand it that way?
R:  Yeah.  That's pretty much what I understood too.
L:  You know, what -- what did you think?
R:  Ah, I don't -- that's -- as far as I'm concerned, I don't think so.  You know, I -- I think one's attitude towards divorce and other people's divorce it's just [SIGH] you know [SIGH] well, what I'm trying to say is you know, you got to take into consideration for yourself and your own attitudes towards marriage, or, you know a commitive relationship of any sort, anyway, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  W- what everybody else is doing doesn't necessarily inter- inf- influence what I think about different things.
L:  Right.  I -- I ah I agree with that.  I -- I feel like even though I feel so badly about ah the high rate of divorce, um, I myself have been married for thirty five years --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to the same person and I um very much you know believe in trying to work things out and -- and in marriage for the long term.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I feel like I do w- w- um look upon divorce with a little bit more, I guess resignation or not acceptance but the fact that it occurs and with a little bit less judgmental attitude than maybe I would have thirty years ago.
R:  Yeah, I think that --
L:  I -- because -- just because there's so many.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's true.  I think, you know, thirty years ago that was a big, you know, big deal, ooh, you got a divorce, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now it's, you know, it's commonplace, which I think the big losers on that deal is the children.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  You know, I think they're the real big losers there because, you know, their parents, you know, but not all parents, you know, you can't say everybody does it, right.
L:  Right.
R:  And [SIGH] but those --
L:  But we're looking at over fifty percent these days, aren't we?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Fifty percent of -- of marriages end in divorce and I think that that overall just seems to be such a -- a -- an acceptance of this happens and in, I think, you know, and a lot of people feel like it just isn't that big of a deal that you're able to, you know, if doesn't -- if you have a little bit of a tiff or you don't see things eye to eye, let's just -- let's just move on or ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what -- what -- so happens it's just amazing right now is um to be talking about this is one of our five sons um is in the middle of a divorce.  Ah, who -- we never thought that would ever happen in our family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ah his wife has just, you know, "I -- I don't love you and I -- I never have loved you and I've been pretending for nine years and so I'm going to move on and find my one true love" and I think that's a prevailing attitude, you know, if it just doesn't work out, or you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you -- you -- there comes a time in marriage where it begins to, you know, you really want to work out, settle into a life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if it isn't everything you fantasize, well you just leave.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that that for me that hasn't happened, but you see it happening and you worry -- I worry about my children and now we're sort of in it and never dreamed we would be, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your -- and grandchildren, if he has any children.
L:  Oh, two.  And here we are, you know, worried about our grandchildren and the effect of that and of course he is too, you know, for the rest of their lives --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that it sure seems that divorce um often runs in families.
R:  Well, I think, yeah, sometimes the pattern does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, you know, that -- you know, if -- if you grew up and mom, you know, you were with your mother and your mother was married three different times, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- that's going to be more acceptable than -- to you than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know someone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who you know, like you said you and your husband have been together for a long time --
L:  Right.  Very true.
R:  -- and so that's -- that's not the pattern that your -- your children were raised with.
L:  Right. That's correct.  And you hope that they -- that they will remember that, you know, and that they will not think that it's an easy, a -- an easy solution to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- difficulties which arise in everyone's life, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's almost that when people start to settle down into the nitty gritty of life, when things happen and -- and you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- want to reach down for what true love really means, they just don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They just say, "Oh, I want to go back to the fantasy of when I was twenty something" you know --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, that's, you know, that's immaturity.  But then, on the other hand, okay, you do have people who maybe thirty years ago stayed in a very bad marriage and they shouldn't have.
L:  Well, that's a good point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's excellent.
R:  Because it was -- it was diff- more difficult to get a divorce, you know, I -- we can both probably remember back to the time where if you really wanted to get a divorce you either had to show that somebody was unfaithful to you or you could go to like, you know, you'd have to go to ah Nevada to get a divorce --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- or Mexico, or some place like that.  And you know, not everybody had that availability like my niece has been going through a divorce and you know it's -- it's probably a good thing that she is because of just the instability of the guy she married.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, she made a poor choice.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Do you think that has ah any bearing that people think, "Well, if I make a poor choice, it's just easy to get out so it really isn't that critical that I make the right choice the first time"?  I don't know, do you think that --
R:  Well --
L:  -- matters?
R:  It might.  But I don't think anybody goes into it in that, you know, frame of mind, really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I think, you know, some people, you know, do do -- get disillusioned with their -- their partner they've chosen for what- various and assorted reasons, they think there's something better over there than what they've got, you know, but it -- to me it's, you know, you can chase rainbows all you want to --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I find ah we have done a lot of volunteer work with ah single adults ages eighteen through thirty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I have found that there seems to be a significant number of them who are very reluctant to get married because they have seen either their own parents or their parents of their friends or just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- society in general with so much divorce and they don't even um want to go there and so they choose not to get married because they don't want to go through that heartbreak and that life changing um situation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that happens when you get divorced.  So, they'd rather just not even get married.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know, I was thinking about something, you know, a minute ago w- you know, it's [SIGH] it may be easier to legally get a divorce, but I don't know if it's easier emotionally for some people at least.
L:  Yeah, I don't think it's ever that easy.
R:  No, I don't either, because you know it's sort of like, e- and financially man that could be [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I totally -- yeah, I -- I find that with all of this, it hasn't changed how I feel about -- about divorce or marriage or anything.
R:  Un-uh.
L:  Um, I -- I wonder if it has though changed the young people who are getting married today, changed their feelings, but I think a strong religious base is about the only thing that keeps you from um succumbing to those ah those feelings.
R:  Mm.  Maybe.
L:  No?  Do you -- do you think there's anything else that would keep people from -- from um altering how they look at at family and marriage, um, because of the high divorce rate?  Besides a religious ah background?
R:  Um, I don't really know.  I -- in general I don't know, but individually I think it just -- it depends upon your commitment, the individual's commitment to the relationship --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that [MN] [SIGH] that comes back to, you know, who can have -- I -- I've known many people who've had deep religious background and I'm sometimes appalled at what they do.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I go, "Okay.  Good, you go to church every Sunday, but you stole sixty thousand dollars from your mom.  Okay.  Yeah."
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know?
L:  Well, you know, that brings up a point, ah, you know, e- that perhaps that -- that some of today's ah values about, you know, are shifting ah because of the frequency of things happening --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and because the frequency of divorce, I think it does alter people's values.  A lot.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And maybe that's what's happening to ah ideas about divorce [MN] and -- and the family unit, it -- because it's so prevalent that it -- it is changing people's -- the way people act.  For me, no, personally ah but ah -- but for others --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think in this day and age it is.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I'm -- somehow I -- I really think it -- it all kicks back to the responsibility of the individual.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's the way I want to put it because I, you know, I know some -- some -- I know one mother that has two sons, you know, and she is not with the father, never has been, never will be and
