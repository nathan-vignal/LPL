R:  Well, did it affect -- did it affect your own life?
L:  Yes.  Um, not so much in a bad way.  I mean, [MN] my parents, um, really weren't meant for each other and, um, I'm glad that they found other people, and, [SIGH] you know, I've gotten to spend time with --

R:  So, it hasn't really affected, uh, you?
L:  No, I don't really [MN] -- I mean, I believe in marriage, but there's a point where I don't because there's so many people that, you know, can't stay together and can't stay committed [SIGH] or can't --

R:  [several inaudible words] -- I don't know what else we're supposed to do.  Uh, do you have anything else to say? [LAUGH]  Not really.
L:  Um, no, not really.  There's, um, a new law that they're trying to pass in Massachusetts about, um --
R:  That, um -- [MN] I didn't understand what you --
L:  -- same sex marriages and such.
R:  -- were saying -- and what?
L:  What -- what are your opinions on that?
R:  Oh, same sexed?  Oh, if they want it --
L:  Um, same sex marriages.
R:  -- you know, if they wanna, you know, be --
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  -- like that, that's up to them.  I mean, it does- -- it really doesn't, you know, affect me one way or another.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And how about yourself? [MN] Excuse me?
L:  Mhm.  Uh, I feel the same way, it's --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- I feel the same way.  It's their opinion and --
R:  [several inaudible words] passing a law in Massachusetts --
L:  -- whatever they wanna do with their lives, that's up to them.  Um --
R:  -- what -- not to get married?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] they're --
R:  [inaudible] get married.
L:  -- trying to pass a law so that --
R:  I don't even know if they have --
L:  -- two people of the same sex can get married.
R:  -- that in New York or not.  
L:  But -- 
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah, there's only a few states that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- actually have passed a law.  I guess it takes, like, six years to get it all [MN] done totally [SIGH].  But they're going through their first phase now [MN].  I went to a wedding at a church not too long ago, and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, [several inaudible words]?
L:  -- like, there the whole wedding was talking about how we should all be --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- against it and this and that, it was like --
R:  [NOISE] That's, uh, that's different [MN].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what else [MN].  I don't know what else to, uh, what else to say [MN].  
L:  Mm.  
R:  I think I'll -- I think [several inaudible words] five or six units.
L:  Do you know how long we've been on?
R:  [inaudible] uh, few minutes left.  
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know what else -- what else --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I -- 'cause I couldn't really hear that well.  What else do -- were we supposed to discuss?  Uh, yeah, right.
L:  Um, I couldn't hear it real well either, it was all crackly and then, um, just how it affects your view of [NOISE] --
R:  [several inaudible words] each other.
L:  -- marriage as an institution.
R:  You know, it should just, I just know, it should work out.
L:  Uh --
R:  [several inaudible words], you know, thing that happened, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  When you're married, you know, there's a lot of, uh, compromises.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  [MN] No, I don't know.  I don't know what else.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It all depends, if -- you know, if they're really, uh, they have a pretty good idea if, you know --
L:  You believe --
R:  -- because then if it doesn't work out --
L:  -- that people should be living together before they're married?
R:  -- yeah, then you don't have to marry each other [SIGH].  I mean, and, you know, I got, uh -- when I got engaged, you know, you didn't -- in that time they didn't believe in that.
L:  Mm.
R:  But now it's, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, now it's different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, my parents, uh, they would have -- they would -- they, you know, they would have had to wait for, like, that.  So, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- what about your parents?  Uh -- do they -- would they feel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, would they -- would they wanna live together?  Or you don't really know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, so this is your fi- -- oh, this is -- this your father's second marriage?  Oh, oh, oh.
L:  [SIGH] Um, I, um, my father, when he met my stepmother they lived together for about four years before they married.
R:  Oh, well, then they believe in that then.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right.  
L:  And then my mother --
R:  [several inaudible words], you know?
L:  -- before she married my stepfather they were living together for --
R:  Yeah, well, that's what they do, and that's what --
L:  -- about a year, but they had known each other --
R:  -- that's what they do today.
L:  -- for many years before.
R:  [several inaudible words] many of the couples.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They, uh, they live together --
L:  I think, really, to know a person you have to live with them, 'cause --
R:  -- before they get married, and then they get married, because I know somebody that just -- were living together and they just got married, you know, in the beginning of June.  So, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
