L:  Hi, I'm Stacey.
R:  Hi, this is Tina.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Oh, fine.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um --
L:  So, what do you think about drug testing?
R:  Um, I think it's a good thing.
L:  Oh, totally, me too.
R:  I think there's --
L:  Without a doubt.
R:  -- too many people out there that want jobs that, you know, if they want their job they need to stay straight and hang onto it --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and if they don't, then they need to get caught and let somebody else that wants a job take one.
L:  Oh yeah, for sure.  Like if there's someone that's going to be more responsible, you know, like you can't depend on someone that's doing drugs and if they are, you got to know --
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  -- like you -- they therefore have the right to know if like they have hired a loyal employee or if they've hired someone, you know, that's coming to work in the morning and then leaving at night and partying and smoking and drinking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, drinking is okay, but smoking pot and --
R:  R- 
L:  -- whatever.
R:  Right.  Right.  They, you know, you can't depend on them like where I work, in ah aviation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'll -- things for planes, you know, you don't want ah have somebody sitting next to you that is not straight and can't do their job --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- right and then wonder if that part's going to be in a plane or not.
L:  Exactly.  It's so -- it's not an invasion of privacy either because like if they're going to get a job then like their employer has a right to know what they're doing.
R:  Right.  You know what, it's usually right there on --
L:  But I think like --
R:  -- the applications that, you know, they're going to drug test.
L:  Yeah.  I think that um --
R:  So --
L:  -- they should start doing like those hair follicle tests on everyone though because there's too many other ways to get around like the urine testing.
R:  Oh, I totally agree.  What State are you from?
L:  I'm from Nevada, I live in Las Vegas.
R:  Oh, I'm from Iowa, I mean is drug use really heavy out there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Big time.
R:  Yeah it is -- it's getting worse here.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it's been around forever, but I think it's getting more and more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with ah people, you know --
L:  It's way big over here.
R:  What?
L:  It's pretty -- it's big over here.
R:  Yeah.  And I mean, a lot of people who -- they're getting into making that meth and everything and it's like, you know, that's bad stuff and you just don't want that around, you know, and around your kids or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- around if you go to a grocer-, you know, go to a grocery store or a Wal Mart or something, you know, you don't want ah be asking somebody for help and maybe have them flip out on ya.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Someone that's working somewhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like tripping.
R:  Right.  Oh, what else did they want us to --
L:  Um, just what we thought about it and is it an invasion of privacy?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I just totally agree with it.  And we've had some people that haven't passed their tests and where I work at too and they've gotten hired too and then you think, "Okay --"
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And then you think, "Okay, now you're really foolish, because why did you try to get a job here if you knew w- you weren't going to pass?"
L:  But wait, they got hired when they didn't pass?
R:  Well, they get hired through a temporary thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then they have to fill out all the pa- they're temporarily hired pending that they pass all of their tests --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so they get to like start their training and stuff 'cause it takes like up to a couple of weeks, depending on how it'll end up, their testing that they want to --
L:  So, they can like clean their act up and --
R:  -- do.
L:  -- they can get a real job?
R:  Yeah.  So ... and their tests came back that they haven't you know passed them, then they have to leave, you know.  How embarrassing.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, would you want to be known as the person who couldn't pass the drug test and ...?
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So.  Have you done many of these calls before?
L:  Just two, I done one last weekend, it was about movies.
R:  Oh, this is my third one that I've done.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I get my -- I get a --
L:  Have you --
R:  What?
L:  You -- I was going to ask you if you've gotten paid?
R:  Yeah, I got paid the other day.
L:  Sweet.
R:  So.
L:  They mailed you a check?
R:  Yep.  They mailed me a check and it had been probably a good month since I had done one, but --
L:  So, how much -- how much was it?
R:  It was twenty dollars.  I did two -- two calls.
L:  Right on, dude.  That's so cool.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  So -- huh?
R:  That was pretty neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But sometimes it's a little harder for I mean you can talk and talk about it, but if they give you only like one or two specific questions, it's hard to think about everything to say for ten minutes, you know?
L:  I know.
R:  Because when you --
L:  Like last weekend I can't even remember what the second question was.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  It's -- then they give you a topic sometimes that's so broad that you could talk about it for a long time and then you have to hang up and -- and you still could say more about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] but [PAUSE] so, do you work in a place that they drug test?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  Nope.  I never have.  I live in like kind of a small town, so only like big businesses, you know, like franchises or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like if you work in some of the [several inaudible words] that are all over the nation, they use drug tests there, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I work in like little small, family owned businesses.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I've been at my job for fifteen years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they did not drug test then and they have a policy that they can random drug test and they never have --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that I've known of and um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's just been the last couple of years when they've started hiring people that they've decided that they were going to --
L:  Why?
R:  -- start drug testing them.  So, that was different, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead they never came out on the floor and gotten anybody and drug tested them, but, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  -- it's always there that they could.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  I think it's totally fair, like, I don't know, it's not even an invasion of privacy at all.  I think that's like the -- if anyone ever said that, it's like you are so dumb.
R:  Hm.  Yeah.  But and we live in a small town, too, but we're -- we live at um -- there's a county nex- the county next to us, they're like um have been -- had the most mass drug busts like in the whole state of Iowa.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  Yeah.  And it's a very, very rural area where it's just all small towns, in fact you get to a big town like what we consider a city here, it's like an hour, an hour and a half in all directions around us.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I mean --
L:  Yeah, I live in like a -- I live like fifteen miles south of Las Vegas and we, in the town I live in, have like fifteen thousand people and they're like, most of them are old and we've had tons of [inaudible] meth labs out here, like --
R:  Yeah.  I think they --
L:  -- so many.
R:  -- go into places like that thinking that they're not going to get busted because it's out of the obvious.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  But they do do a lot of training around here with the officers and I think with like um the plants are like the factories and stuff like that, they're doing more training to help people recognize that more so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it's not just the normal smoking pot that you're going to be, as an obvious, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to people, you know, all pie eyed and stuff, they're not, you know, I don't know.
L:  How old are you?
R:  Thirty four.
L:  Okay.  I'm young.  I'm seventeen.
R:  You're only seventeen?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, goodness.  Yeah, I'll be thirty five next month.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm married, I have --
L:  I'm just a little baby.
R:  What, you have a little baby?
L:  No, I said I'm just a little baby.
R:  Oh, you're just a little baby.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was going to say, I have a little baby, so --
L:  So, you're like damn, you're young to have a little baby [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, no, not really.  Not anymore.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's more and more younger kids have kids, babies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, so --
L:  I know.  I get -- out here there's a lot of kids that -- or a lot of people that have children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like in high school.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Hard.
R:  -- I have -- I have four girls.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, my oldest one's twelve and my youngest one is five months.
L:  So, they haven't got to the stage of getting a job where they have to be drug tested?
R:  No, they haven't, but they do a lot of um like my fifth grader, like last year I think, they started with talking about um drugs more and more to 'em in school.
L:  Like DARE?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they do DARE out there, yeah?
R:  Like DARE.  We have DARE out here.
L:  Yeah, we do here.
R:  And um -- have you talked about DARE before, Taylor? Oh [NOISE] my one girl who is in fourth grade, she said they haven't talked about it very much, but, you know I think they need to do that.
L:  We did it in fifth grade.  Fifth grade is when we did it and we did it again in eighth grade.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But like I almost think DARE like introduces the kids to it, you know?
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  It's like, oh, use marijuana and this is what it is.  Don't do it, but now the kids know that there's something that they're not supposed to do and they're like, "Oh, shit, let's go do it".
R:  Right, because, you know, kids are going to be tempted.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I agree with that point too, it's like, you know, they need to be introduced, but how much do they need to be introduced to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, without 'em piquing their interest too much that they feel like they wanna test, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE] 
R:  [MN] [PAUSE] I don't know.  You said there's fifteen thousand people in your town?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  There's probably like fifteen hundred in our town.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's way small.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It's very small.  You said you lived in a small town, then you said fifteen thousand.  I'm like, ooh, that's way big to me, but --
L:  Wow.  That's -- I could not imagine how that is for your kids because like I've grown up -- I've lived here my whole life and like I've grown up with all the same people and like everyone knows everything about everyone else because we've all been together for so long, you know --
R:  Well, how c- --
L:  -- and you just get sick of it.
R:  Well, how big was like your school when you -- well, you p- -- have you graduated?
L:  Ah, no, not yet.
R:  You graduate this year?
L:  Yeah, there's ah, shit [NOISE] there's um like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably in my graduating class, like if I stayed at school at Boulder, there'd be like a hundred and fifty kids, maybe two hundred kids, in my class [NOISE].
R:  That'd be about like what we -- well, what was in my graduating class.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But like where my kids
