R:  I'm Rhonda.
L:  Hi.  Rhonda, my name's Mary.
R:  Um, you ever been married before?
L:  I have.
R:  Have you been divorced?
L:  No.  Have you?
R:  Yes.  I've actually been divorced twice.  I've been married three times.
L:  Are you married now?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I didn't hear the first part of her question.
R:  It was cutting out.
L:  Oh --
R:  I'm not so sure what it was either.  Because it was cutting in and out --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so all I know is something about has divorced changed the way you feel about marriage, being married and things?  Yeah.
L:  Family values and what not?  So --
R:  Um --
L:  -- do you have an opinion on that?
R:  Actually, no I don't -- I mean, I have an opinion, but I don't think divorce has -- has changed my family values or anything.  Um, p- people get divorced for different reasons --
L:  Did you --
R:  -- you know, I mean sometimes it just isn't going to work out, you know, sometimes the other [several inaudible words] but that, you know, that doesn't change -- didn't change my opinion on values or anything.
L:  Did you have children with your other marriages?
R:  I have children from my first marriage. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Mhm.  Did you find that it affected them in a negative way?
R:  Not really because they were two and five when we got a divorce and they're actually probably closer to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the man I'm married to now because we've been married for four and a half years than they are their father because they don't really get along with their father that well because he hasn't s- he has children by this -- because he remarried also and they, you know, really don't like to go see him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because he makes a [inaudible] in 'em. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah, I think -- I think -- does your husband that you have now have other children?
R:  No, he had never been married and didn't have children. [PAUSE]
L:  I think that makes a big difference, too, um, just I'm thinking, you know, here it is ten o'clock at night and we're just now getting settled in and we don't have to be split in other directions like you said, your children are --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ah they like the -- the nuclear family, they like your husband that you have now as -- as --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as a role model for um -- as being their father.
R:  Yes.
L:  And the person that's there at night when they go to sleep, that type of thing.  But I was just thinking, um, I think it doesn't affect maybe family values, but it does affect family structure if kids are pulled all different directions and just the -- the exhaustion and I know, I've got lots of friends that are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um in second or third marriages where they have combined --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- his hers and theirs type of thing --
R:  Right.  And so that was --
L:  -- and um --
R:  I made a conscious choice when --
L:  -- just the pure exhaustion of getting everybody in every direction but --
R:  -- I decided to be remarried that I didn't want someone else with kids because my kids were the most important thing.  Me, I wasn't for sure how I would feel about their children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how they would feel about mine if we, you know, each had our own.  And that was a conscious decision I made, you know, he had never been married and he didn't have children and he didn't want his own children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he wants kids, but he didn't want his own.  You know, so I was like, that's, you know, that's perfect. [PAUSE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  One's almost thirteen and the other one will be eleven.
L:  Oh, it is.  It is.  How old are they now?
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE] [NOISE]
L:  Those are some pretty crucial times, but you guys have already been married four years?  Cool.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, it's just my husband me, we've been -- we weren't divorced, but had we got married, we would have been, we were together several years prior to getting married --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and um [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just thankful that kids didn't enter the picture fifteen years ago when we were together.
R:  If he was married [several inaudible words] we were married three years before we had kids.
L:  And they finally came along just a few years back, but um --
R:  Yeah.  I d- and my second marriage was just a kind of one of those stupid things people do, so it didn't last and I knew it wasn't going to so, you know, [PAUSE] right and that's exactly, you know, I was like, "Oops, this is the biggest mistake I ever made" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and sorry, ah, you know, he had never been married either --
L:  Why waste anyone's time?
R:  -- and I'm like, you know, sorry, but it's not working and [PAUSE] [NOISE] --
L:  Ah, so many women just hang around hoping it's going to get better --
R:  Mn nn.
L:  -- going to get better.  And it doesn't.
R:  Right.
L:  And in their question that they asked us about whether it changes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- your family values, I don't think it changes it if anything, I think it shows what we want, um and like you said, what you would look for the next time around.
R:  No, I don't think it does.
L:  Um [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, because I mean I was from a divorced --
L:  I don't think it changes people's --
R:  -- I mean my parents were divorced and --
L:  -- I don't know that it changes people's values --
R:  I don't think I had any different values than my friends who, you know, whose parents stayed married, my grandparents were married, you know, I mean you know my mother wasn't expecting to get a divorce or anything and I -- people's values when they're young are usually about the same anyway, everybody wants to get married and stay married for the rest of your life, I mean, things happen, I mean that's just a fact of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's happened ever since the beginning of time.  So, I mean, I don't think that's values at all.  People can let it affect them --
L:  Sure --
R:  -- personally, which could -- could possibly affect their values, but I don't think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- generally speaking it affects people's values.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Do you think it's um mm people talk about the divorce rate, do you think that --
R:  Mhm.  I think if they made it more difficult to get a divorce --
L:  -- um kinda probe in your head since I fortunately haven't been --
R:  -- then people would not get married as easily as they did --
L:  -- in that position, but do you think um people are just more inclined to get out instead of stick it through?
R:  Mhm.  Because like my second marriage, I know if -- it would -- if I would have --
L:  Oh, I'd like your opinion on that because --
R:  -- waited because my mother pa --
L:  -- several people say, well that makes you stuck --
R:  -- we got married in April, my mother passed away nine days after I got married --
L:  -- and I'm with you, I think it just gives more forethought.
R:  If I'd have waited --
L:  Um --
R:  -- and my mother hadn't have been mar- you know, hadn't have passed away, had passed away before I got married, I would never have married him.  And -- because I got hit, you know, like right in the head with a sledge hammer like, ooh, my life has totally changed --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I was an only child and my mother was forty five when she passed away, you know, so -- and I was like ooh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that had a lot to do with me personally, you know, and --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- our marriage.  I knew --
L:  Uh oh.
R:  -- basically, walking down the aisle that that marriage wasn't going to work --
L:  Oh my.
R:  But -- but you know, I was to the point that ah everyone was there and my -- what was really good was my mother had checked --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- herself out of the hospital to come to my wedding because she happened to be in hospital when, you know, we --
L:  Did she really?
R:  -- one of those that happened.  And I couldn't do that for her, you know, but I mean she had done that [PAUSE] like you know, so I mean, not, you know, walking down the aisle, it wasn't working.
L:  Oh.
R:  [COUGH] And I pretty much told him from nn nn.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Pretty much at once that it wouldn't work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, you know, I was totally honest with him, I told him I didn't love him [PAUSE] he still had, he was -- he was [PAUSE] he was I don't know, pretty good about it [PAUSE] --
L:  Um, not that you weren't responsible for part of that, but um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- couldn't he have seen that coming [LAUGH]? You were in a -- a life place mm [PAUSE] well, talking about um getting a divorce, my husband and I, we lived together seven years before we got married and we've changed a lot since then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I just -- I'm -- I regret that but um we weren't in the same lifestyle that we are now and um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we accepted Christ about --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- mm eight years ago, but we've been together since eighty six and um just lived a really rambunctious life and it's nothing short of a miracle that we're together now and it's almost like a divorce when I -- I look at it that way, we had um split up and um the reason I mention that is the pain a -- and I don't believe that um -- I know it's something we, as a society, do to ourselves, but individually and personally, like you said, no one hopes for that, no one ever when they're growing up thinks that that's going to happen to 'em --
R:  Right.  It does.  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- um they think maybe they'll do something different so that it doesn't happen to them, but --
R:  [inaudible] [NOISE] --
L:  -- I find that um --
R:  Right. [several inaudible words] the -- this marriage --
L:  -- I don't know what I'm thinking of, the headlines and stuff we often --
R:  -- I knew what I wanted --
L:  -- missed the part that there's a lot of grieving people out there --
R:  -- I knew --
L:  -- so, I guess in the part --
R:  -- not who I wanted, but I knew what I wanted.
L:  -- that talks about changing your -- your opinion on family values it, if anything, it just makes you yearn for that that much more and wanting to um get it right the next time around [PAUSE]
