L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello? [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  My name's Colleen.
L:  I'm sorry, Colleen?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi.  I'm Pam.
R:  Pam?  Hi.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice meeting you.
R:  I --
L:  Um, I've never done this one before. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, this is my third one.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's real easy.  We just talk for a few -- for about ten minutes.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I caught the, ah, subject late but I think I heard that it was how do I feel about banning smoking in public places?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, being a hardcore smoker like I am, I hate it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I love it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, good, we'll have a good controversial talk. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm not into it.  I -- I used to smoke and, um, I just -- I can't breathe around it anymore. [NOISE] It just [NOISE] -- my allergies and, [NOISE] um, I've got asthma [NOISE] and [NOISE] it just doesn't work. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I can appreciate that but --
L:  And I -- you know, I hate going to restaurants and, you know, you either try to get in the sm- smoking section and non smoking section.  And I have a small [NOISE] son that, you know, I don't want him around it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Because he's at risk for developing, ah, asthma.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like yourself.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, I don't c- -- I don't [NOISE] care for it. [NOISE]
R:  Well, and I don't mind they ban it in restaurants 'cause you're not in a restaurant for more than an hour or two.
L:  Right.
R:  That's not a big deal.  But when they ban it in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where drinking and smoking, ah, kinda, go hand in hand ...
L:  Well, and they got one in one hand and one in the other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's, kinda, where I go, "That's too much.  That's ridiculous".  A- --
L:  And I don't mind it there because [NOISE] you know you're going into [NOISE] the environment that it's gonna be there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  And that's -- that's sh- -- everyone should --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- expect that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, that's just -- that's just, kinda, the way it is, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I just don't like it, like, where I work at.  You know, it's supposed to be a non smoking area but in order to walk into the building [NOISE] you have to walk [NOISE] through the smokers. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Really?
L:  A- and then, [NOISE] ah, it just [NOISE] clings to me all day and that's all [NOISE] I smell.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I don't like that [NOISE] because I have a hard time, like I said, breathing when I go through it. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Are they outside or inside?
L:  [NOISE] They're outside. [NOISE] We've got, like, a courtyard and --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- there's not supposed to be smoking there of course.  It says, you know, right by the sign, "No smoking.  Non smoking establishment".  And then there's a designated smoking area in two spots but those aren't good enough.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, they, kinda, overtake areas and stand under [NOISE] the sign.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that -- that's irritating. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I -- they've got a spot where, you know, is covered from the rain and then they've got a spot that is -- you know, [NOISE] has a [NOISE] picnic table [NOISE] and chairs and benches and it's really [NOISE] nice. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they cannot keep it to that and then there's [NOISE] cigarette butts all over the place.
R:  Ah.
L:  [NOISE] All in our landscaping they've just thrown their little butts everywhere and it's -- I mean --
R:  Yeah.  I don't agree with --
L:  -- our building's only a year o- -- [NOISE] not even a year old and it already looks awful because of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And to me that's rude.
R:  I don't agree with that.  Has the place provided --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ashtrays?
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  They --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- should be kind enough --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to put their butts in an ashtray.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I just got back --
L:  [NOISE] But they don't.
R:  I just got back from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Peru and the entire time I was walking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- around picking up other people's cigarette butts 'cause I don't care for that either.  I mean, I carry a --
L:  When --
R:  -- little ashtray.  I mean, it's [inaudible].
L:  That -- to me, that's rude.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I agree with you.  That is --
L:  You know, if you're gonna do it, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pick it up.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't leave your butts laying around.
L:  You know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They wouldn't like me throwing my diet Coke cans everywhere.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  And that takes about as long for 'em to -- both to decompose.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  I wish --
R:  A- --
L:  -- they would, you know, move --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but when the bigwig there is one of the ones in the middle of it there's not a lot that can be done.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.  What part of the country do you live in?
L:  [NOISE] I'm in Kansas City, [NOISE] Kansas. [NOISE]
R:  Kansas City --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Kansas?  Ah --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Deadwood, South Dakota.
L:  You're where?
R:  Deadwood, South Dakota.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What's your weather like?
R:  Well, it's been hot for the last --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- few days.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Nineties.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] We got up to, I think, ninety three today.
R:  Yeah.  I think we only --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hit eighty three today so that's --
L:  [MN]
R:  That was a nice change. [LAUGH] 'Cause ninety --
L:  I would love that.
R:  A- --
L:  And we've got fireworks going off like crazy and my son's scared of 'em so he runs --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and jumps in my lap as soon as they start going off.
R:  [LAUGH] Jeeze.
L:  Can you shoot fireworks there?
R:  Ah, no.  No.  I'm in middle of the national park, so no.
L:  Oh.  That would be [PAUSE] --
R:  No.  They do have --
L:  -- pretty down there.
R:  They do in ma- -- designated spots but that's it.
L:  [NOISE] That would be, ah -- you know, you still see 'em [NOISE] but then you don't have to worry 'em burning your house or the [NOISE] -- the forest [NOISE] down.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And luckily, we've had enough --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rain here so it's not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a hu- huge problem but -- but last year, we had forest fires [inaudible] so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was ...
L:  [NOISE] You had one last year?
R:  They even -- they even called some of them off last year --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- the fireworks displays 'cause it was so bad.  It was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so dry.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I -- I'm not into 'em.  They just -- they're pretty but they're just obnoxious.
R:  Yeah.  Too loud. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and they don't b- -- have any consideration.  I mean, they were going off 'til midnight last night and I had to go to work [LAUGH] this morning.
R:  Oh, jeeze.  Oh, that's not right.
L:  And I guess I'm just getting old and just don't like 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] I get it.  Yeah.
L:  Somebody at [NOISE] work today told me, "If, ah, they bother you and annoy you, you're just getting old".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess I'm old then.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's all --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- there is to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  But yeah, I agree with you about restaurants, they don't need to have it there.  You know, they used to be -- divided up the smoking and non smoking and -- and I could see where that doesn't really solve the problem.  But --
L:  W- --
R:  -- when it comes down to bars, that goes -- have you ever been out in California?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, they're starting to -- you can't have s- -- Berkeley, California started it first, I know, and I think it's spreading throughout California.  You can't even smoke in a bar anymore.  So, what are you supposed to do?  Take your beer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- outside and have a beer and [LAUGH] cigarettes, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Well, I mean, it's always been in bars [NOISE] and people know that when you go to a [NOISE] bar --
R:  There's gonna be smoke.
L:  -- there's gonna be smoking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you don't do it, don't like it, then don't go to the bar or [NOISE] make the bar where it's, you know, [NOISE] one section is [NOISE] non smoking, one section's [NOISE] smoking. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I've seen that done before and I've even seen, you know, some -- even here, they had one non smoking without, ah, gambling here in Deadwood.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And they -- they tried the non smoking casino for a while.  Of course, that didn't last very long. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, see, that's one of the reasons I don't go to the casino much.  That and I don't like to the lose the money.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, e- -- there's so much smoking and you can't even breathe.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Right.
L:  And, you know, our -- we've got the casinos here and you just -- we've got the riverboat casinos --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, [NOISE] it's every floor.  And, ah, one time, they were gonna do one floor that wasn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smoking but the problem with that was it was the -- one of the ones that had no machines that anybody liked.
R:  Oh.  Huh.
L:  And, like --
R:  That doesn't make much sense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You have to spread --
L:  So, I'm just not into all that.
R:  Yeah.  They gotta spread the machines that people like around.  Do you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if they're gonna do that.  And if they've got four floors, they could do the -- the different, you know -- could have a non smoking area.
L:  And then a lotta times too you had to walk through the smoking area to get to that one.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And that -- you know, they do that on the restaurants too -- the smoking area's in the front, the non smoking's in the [NOISE] back but in order to get there, you have to go through the smoking area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which, kinda, defeats the purpose.
R:  Yeah.  It does.  And then places should have, you know, some, kind of, an air filtration --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- system.
L:  They don't.  Most of 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't.
R:  Most of 'em don't and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And that's pretty --
L:  And then, you know, if they're gonna have that area [NOISE] then they need to have [NOISE] something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  There's all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kinds of those --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out anymore, you know, that really do clean the air of smoke.  You know, we've got a couple of 'em in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Alpine out of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Minnesota makes a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really good one.  And you just flip that on and, gosh, you don't know there's been smoke --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cigarette smoke in there, you know?  It really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really smells good and --
L:  Well, both my mother and my mother in law smoke and, you know, you can -- you smell it -- I can smell it on people --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- that smoke. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I know you can. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My mom didn't smoke and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, she sent me an --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- article of clothing and I sent it back to her and she said, "Hey, it smells like smoke". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I know. [NOISE] When my [NOISE] mom brings something over you can smell it on the -- like, the plastic baggie or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can just smell it on it.
R:  Yep.
L:  [NOISE] And she made some stuff for my son when he was [NOISE] first born, ah, some quilts [NOISE] and stuff and you could smell it on it. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I was always having to [NOISE] wash it before I [LAUGH] could even put it on -- near him.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But it did come out, right?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it does.
R:  Okay.  Good.
L:  It does but it just [NOISE] m- -- to me, it's gross.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it is.  It's not a good habit but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unfortunately, back when I started it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the thing to do.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Well --
R:  Marlboro Man and all of that. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I smoked for what?  Maybe two [NOISE] or three years.
R:  Did ya?  Yeah.
L:  And it was -- well, it was when I was going through my divorce and then the, ah -- my nerves were just shot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it does good for that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yup.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And if, you know ...  You're lucky you quit 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it's not easy to quit.
L:  [NOISE] Actually, it was really easy for me.
R:  Was it?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I got bronchitis and that as it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that would do it. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That was the [NOISE] last time. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Yep.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That would do it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I've got a bad cold and I should a just quit but I didn't. [LAUGH]
L:  M- --
