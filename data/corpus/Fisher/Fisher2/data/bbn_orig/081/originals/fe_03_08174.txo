L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello.  I didn't hear everything she said.  I know they said something about family values.  My name is Mary.  How are you?
L:  Hi Mary.  I'm Karen.  Where are you from?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.  I'm from New York.
R:  Oh, I love New York.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, it's family values and it says, the increase of divorce rate the moral affect you?
R:  Okay and she said, I heard her say something about um --
L:  How does it influence your --
R:  -- have you changed your attitude to marriage?
L:  Right.
R:  Well, I've been divorced [LAUGH] have they changed my a- yeah, I think so.  I guess that would depend on from when to when.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, yeah, it has.  Um --
R:  Your attitude has changed?  Have you been married, divorced or --
L:  Oh, no, no, it hasn't changed.  It, but you know, it changes how you feel and how you act.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I mean divorce does?
L:  Yeah.  To, you know, um in your own relationships.
R:  In your own moral relationships?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.  Um, you think divorce does that or do you think just the times have done it too?
L:  The times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the whole -- overall everything, you know, affects ah because it would all be um re- you know, when you see divorce all around you and everything, um, how -- when you're in relationships and everything, it would affect it because, you know, you think you don't want it to happen to you.  Unless it's, you know, for obvious reasons.
R:  Yeah.  Have you been divorced?
L:  No.
R:  No.  Yeah, that's true though.  I can remember before my brother ever got married he didn't want to -- he said something like um, everybody he was a best man for the w- their -- they divorced and it aff- --
L:  He didn't want it to happen to him.
R:  Yeah.  I think a lot of people are single, I don't know if that's why.
L:  Yeah, they wait --
R:  Um --
L:  -- or they get married a lot later.
R:  Yeah.  I -- or else, yeah, either they -- the one or the other or they s- they get divorced, they don't remarry, um --
L:  They just have relationships.
R:  They have relationships, but I wonder, you know, I think everybody has this -- has a fear of intimacy.  I think that's much more common.  Protecting yourself.
L:  Yeah.  I think that, I agree with, you know, because once you -- because of um, you know, the divorce rate and moral you know is how it affects you, I don't know, I think it does, but I think overall, you know, with the divorce rate all around the world then [inaudible] mo- a lot of relationships.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, the other thing is, when I was young, ah people -- I lived in a small town.  I was born in New York, actually, but um we lived in a small town -- and the only thing is my grandparents were immigrants --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and they moved into a town where there were other immigrants.
L:  Okay.
R:  And where they came and ah we had the same thing in New York, there were ethnic --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- you know, there was a little Hungary, there was little everywhere, little [inaudible], you know --
L:  And [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- there was all the -- all the neighborhoods, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and ah the thing is you would generally at that time marry within your --
L:  Your ethnic group.
R:  Yeah.  And so you didn't just have your own caring for each other, but you also had the, you know, parents, the family, the -- the [inaudible] family because you knew each other and then you had those ethnic things you belonged to, the hunky hall or whatever, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all these other things.  So, you had -- and then you also generally would marry within your religion and I don't seem much religion anymore either.
L:  No, that's taken away in a lot of situations.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's --
R:  So, you had other things that bound you as well and I know if like, having been through it, I will say that um it's not easy to get divorced --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then the thing is that if you get divorced and then you remarry, [inaudible] you could have just well as stayed married.  It's getting through the bad times.
L:  Right.
R:  Sometimes, I mean, you -- you're married to somebody who's like, what, ah -- you know, is ah serial killer or something, but most of the time they're just people and there's just -- we were promised there would be Prince Charming if you were good and you cooked and cleaned and washed and ironed, Prince Charming would come.  But of course that wasn't true.
L:  Right.
R:  And then, the same was true for men.  I think they're taught that you will work for the rest of your life and give half of your money to whoever's standing there when you get home.  And that's not really good either.
L:  No.  Yeah, you know and -- you know, but now it's, you know, everyone also is [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, everybody has -- where everybody has to share -- you have to like each other for different reasons.
L:  Right.
R:  And there has to be a lot there because there will be rough times, with anybody.
L:  Right.  Um, and it -- yeah, in any type of relationship then family relationships, too, I mean, it's the same situation.
R:  Yes.  Well, it does affect, you're right.  If you are referring to that in a very subtle way, but yes.  If you see your parents get divorced, or your friends, I'm sure it affects --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you and how you react to these things or how you want to do these things or if you want to do them.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I also think people don't talk.  It said family values initially, but I just don't think people talk enough about that before they marry.  I don't think they talk about if they want kids, how they want to raise them, things like that.
L:  No, I never did.  I know that.
R:  No?
L:  No.  Yeah, because you know that was -- you never thought it was important until after it happened.
R:  Mhm.  It just, yeah, I guess you say life will take care of itself, sort of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.  And then you come to realize, oh, they don't think just like you do [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you find out later on.
R:  And that causes trouble, you know.  A heap of trouble sometimes.  But then that's the thing.  I think if parents don't come together, I -- I think kids are better off if parents either one should back off and let the other one kind of be in charge, or else they have to really agree.
L:  Yeah.  And they -- all -- we don't always do that.
R:  No way.  It's impossible.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, to always agree.  But to have a basic philosophy about how to raise kids, and I guess when sometimes they get a little too um -- the idea is of course to raise them [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you -- and [inaudible] relationship you have, it's supposed to grow away from you, they're supposed to, you know, grow up and go away and that's just like against our nature.
L:  Um, actually now a lot of people don't even, you know, when they grow up, they don't go away.
R:  Either some kids, though, either -- either ah don't leave home or go back home.
L:  Yeah, that's a normal thing now.  You know, because you can't afford -- they can't afford to be out there.  But ah, but me myself [inaudible] you know, when I see all these people divorce, it does make me stop and think of a lot of things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, before -- you know, because um I -- I think of that and I don't want it to happen and, you know, just by little things that could happen.  You know, you could do something stupid and it could happen.
R:  You could do something stupid, I guess, but everybody does stuff stupid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean I guess that's the whole idea, is to have a relationship that's deep enough.  I'm -- I just think if I ever landed with anybody again I would want um to be close friends, best friends, more than anything else.
L:  Yeah, I think that's important.
R:  Laughing to me is the most important thing.  If a day, you know, going out in the world everyday stinks. [LAUGH] The world's hard.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Um, you know, people are nasty, stuff happens, ah things go wrong.  If you can come home and um be glad --
L:  And talk with someone and laugh, that --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  That's a big thing.
R:  Yeah.  But if they just add to the misery of the day, well then they're -- I don't -- I don't need that.
L:  Yeah, that's a good point.  Because, you know, we don't always think that way.
R:  Yeah.  A lot of times I think people just want someone, because we're trained like that.  You just want someone to be in your life.  But I d- I don't know, I think it's better to want a  quality person that's good for you [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah.  But then again, you have to have people who um, who make themselves like who they know their partner wants.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  And then afterwards they change.
R:  Of course.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. That's too true.  That's the thing, you know, they have a -- like a lot of single things around here and I w- and a lot of them are dress up things.  Well, I don't like to dress up.  I mean, I have to dress up for work everyday.  I would, at the end of the day, I want to be in jeans or I want to be casual --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so, you know, then I think, "Oh, yes" I go and I put on all this makeup and I do all this stuff and then that's not who I am.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not who I want to be, you know, and so I don't want to do that.
L:  Yeah, that happens and I mean well, like, you know, we get to be something we don't want to be, sometimes.
R:  Yes.  You always have to watch yourself because I think almost anybody it can happen to, you know, you want to please someone because you like them, you want them.
L:  Right.
R:  I guess it's hard not to do that.  And you surely --
L:  And you --
R:  -- you don't know if the other person's doing it.
L:  That's true.  And you know what, technically morally we're not doing the right thing that way.
R:  Well, we're not being true to ourselves.
L:  Right.  And to the other person because [inaudible] getting to know and care about someone who's an -- you know, who you're not.
R:  Yeah.  That's right.  That's exactly what I think, too.
L:  Hm.
