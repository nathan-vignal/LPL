R:  Uh-huh.
L:  M- -- but it's, like --
R:  No --

R:  Yeah.  Tissue paper, whatever I can get my hands on I use to scrap book.
L:  Ah.
R:  It's, kind of, expensive if you use the, um -- the Creative Memories stuff and all the -- the fancy stuff.
L:  Have you gone to some of those parties though? [COUGH]
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  No?
R:  I haven't.
L:  I have a couple of friends that have all these Creative Memories stuff and ... so, like, usually I'll go to their parties and I'll use, like, all the free [LAUGH] stuff that I'm allowed [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then I'll buy, like, some little token thing, you know?  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't cr- -- as crazy as some of my friends do and I have friends -- well, a lot of them it's 'cause they have kids and especially their first kid and so they just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- totally go nutzoid.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'm, like -- I don't have kids at this point in time and so ...  I mean, I keep pictures -- I do a lot of -- I go to theatre a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and see plays.
R:  You keep the tickets and stuff?
L:  Yeah.  So, I keep tickets and playbills and I like to volunteer a lot so I've -- I've those, kinda, pictures.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...  So, how many hours would you say you spend a week or a month or -- on it?
R:  Well, recently, 'cause it's summer and I have a lot more time on my hands, I've been spending many more hours working on it but during the year I don't have a lotta time to spend so, maybe like, an hour a week [LAUGH] if that.
L:  So, are you a student or a teacher or ...?
R:  I am.  I'm a student.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  So ...

R:  I will be a junior.
L:  You will be a junior?  What are you studying?
R:  Anthropology.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mainly archaeology.
L:  So, I guess, almost [LAUGH] going to -- I guess almost going to school is almost a hobby except it's more of a job than a hobby I'm sure.
R:  Yeah, it's more of a job I would have to say. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, do you have a special area of anthropology you wanna get into?
R:  Archaeology.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, I guess that's, kind of, a hobby right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I bet.
R:  Until I can -- until I can get a job.
L:  Now, have you been on digs?
R:  Yeah, I have.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yep.
L:  Like, all in the United States or overseas?
R:  Um, in Virginia mainly.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, it's been fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  So, have you always wanted to be archaeologist?
R:  Since I was probably a junior in high school --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I would have to say.  So --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- I've -- I've stuck with it unlike a lotta people that I know.  So.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, would you say it was a hobby that turned into a -- a b- -- desired profession?
R:  I w- -- I guess you could say that.  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Kind of, started out as, like, interest in history and everything and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess, it's, pretty much, a hobby. [LAUGH]
L:  That's cool.
R:  What kind of hobbies do you have?
L:  Well, I'm a librarian --
R:  A librarian?
L:  Yeah.  And I knew I wanted to be a librarian when I was ... oh, probably three to five years old.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  And so, I always knew and I had a couple of, like -- I had more -- I knew I had to get my masters to be in -- come a decent librarian but --
R:  Right.
L:  So, I had to figure out -- kids[?] that were doing, like, in my undergradding 'cause I knew I was getting my Masters in Library Science.  And also, I just survived undergrad and [LAUGH] there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- were times think, "This doesn't make -- worth it" and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I hung out and I got that masters so ...
R:  Good.
L:  I actually work in youth detention with kids in lockups so ...
R:  Oh, wow.  That's gotta be a --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- a trying position.
L:  Yeah.  It's a very [LAUGH] -- it's -- it was not what I expected. [LAUGH] I am -- I thought it was gonna be your typical, you know, summer reading program, um, you know, preschool story time mommy me lap sit and -- no, I'm working with kids in lockups.  Ah, but they're -- it's a real fun population and it's --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- also during the, um, s- -- well, actually, during the week, I -- I teach library skills --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, computer skills and how to use ... well, this week we're d- -- working on road maps so, you know --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- how to read a road map [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all the different little symbols and that, kinda, stuff.
R:  Well, that's useful.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we're in the life skills department so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- how to use a almanac, how to use encyclopedias.  There's -- 'cause there's some kids that are just, like, "Okay, what's the --"
R:  Whol l- --
L:  "-- why use an encyclopedia?"  You know?  It's, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It's down[?] and it's dirty[?].  It's really easy.  I'm -- I learn stuff about almanacs and Guinness World Records that I didn't know before until I had to start teaching these classes so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm always finding, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, new websites for them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so ...
R:  Right.
L:  And then doing reading and so ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  Well, that's neat.
L:  So, let's see, my hobbies are: I read, [SIGH] which is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, half -- half for work and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- half just because -- because --
R:  You enjoy it?
L:  -- I also -- I lead one book group and then I'm also in, like, a church ladies one.  I'm --
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  Yeah.  And I [SIGH] -- so, reading's a big one.  I do cross stitch.
R:  Okay.
L:  One of my goals is whenever one of my b- -- friends has a baby, I try to cross stitch a bib for her.
R:  Well, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  And it's a great thing where -- I'm trying to lose weight so I do cross stitch in front of the TV, you know, that way, hopefully, I won't eat as much food, you know, in front --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] of the TV.
R:  It keeps your fingers busy.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I do a lot of, um, volunteering.  I work, like, at one, kind of like a -- [MN] it's a professional theatre but it's more of a community theatre size --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I do, um, concessions for them.  So --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- whenever there's a run -- and there's, like, five or six shows a year -- I do, pri- --
R:  You work the stands?
L:  I do -- yeah, I work the stands, work the concessions.  So, that's pretty cool.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I -- we have a big thing called Folk Life, which is a gigantic Folk Life festival on Memorial Day weekend --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I've, like, worked for them and I've done a lot of volunteer work for them and I'm -- I'm always volunteering.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Whenever I hear something that just says, like, "Sure I'll volunteer"  And even at work with --
R:  So, that takes up a lot of -- a lotta your time?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  It does. [LAUGH] I'm always -- but, you know, you usually -- if you're willing to put in a couple of hours of volunteer time you can get behind stage and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, you can get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- free goodies or they'll feed you and so --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- you know, it w- -- it ends up both ways. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  Ah ...
R:  And this -- do you spend a lotta time cross stitching?  'Cause I know I tried to learn how to cross stitch and I was a failure at it just 'cause I wasn't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- patient enough.
L:  I think I started, like, in high school with the ones where it was, like, printed on the pillowcase and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you can still see that light blue.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And now I'm, kinda, to the point where ... I can't really do my own designs but, like, I'll take a -- a -- like, a little bit of one design and a little bit of another design and almost, like, my own picture kinda thing.
R:  Oh, that's a neat idea.
L:  Yeah.  Or, like, you know, if it's, like, "Okay, I like how this is done but I don't --"
R:  Mhm. 
L:  "-- don't like this wording" so I'll redo it and ...  So, I, kind of --
R:  That's --
L:  -- make it my own.
R:  -- impressive. [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  It's neat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  So ... Huh ... What, kind of --
R:  A- --
L:  -- um, [SIGH] -- what, kind of, sport hobbies do you have?  Do you have any -- to burn after all that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, energy from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- heavy? study? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I used to do gymnastics for a while --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and so I, kind of -- I try to do a little bit of gymnastics but it hasn't been successful.  Um, I like to play tennis --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- it's my biggest one and I just -- I just started running this year.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  So, I enjoy -- I've actually never thought I would say this before but I enjoy running. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  I know.  It's a big step. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's a big step but I'm sh- -- no pun intended. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I --
R:  Well, I -- I enjoy being outside and so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, like --
L:  So, do you, like, hike a lot or backpack or ...?
R:  I don't backpack.  I like to, like, walk.  I -- there's not --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- many places around here to hike where I am so --
L:  So --
R:  -- you don't really get a chance to do that.
L:  -- are you in, like, right in the city or ...?
R:  Um, I'm actually in Williamsburg.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, it's, kind of, really flat [LAUGH] for hiking.
L:  Okay.  So, it's more of a flat, long -- that's my, kind of, thing 'cause I don't do -- I have crabby ankles so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I like to -- like, there's a lake near our pl- -- um, the -- it's very popular -- it's called Green Lake -- and the -- the thing is to go to Starbucks 'cause hey, you know, [several inaudible words] is coffee --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you get your Starbucks coffee and then you walk Green Lake and -- which is about three miles.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, if you get a skinny, you know, latte you're actually, maybe, burning some calories rather than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just taking them in so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's usually very, very, very crowded, um, you know, w- --
