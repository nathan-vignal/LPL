L:  Hello?
R:  Hello. 
L:  Hi.
R:  Yes, hi.
L:  My name is Rebecca and I live in Michigan.
R:  Hi.  My name is Floyd and I live in Los Angeles.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, wow.  
R:  Yeah, I was, uh -- my phone, when the, uh, thing is trying to talk to me, it sounds like it has an echo, so I couldn't really hear the two questions.
L:  That's what mine has.  I think --
R:  I think one --
L:  -- it was about divorce.
R:  Yeah, first one was, I think, about divorce changing people's views, and the other one was seeing marriage as a -- a -- I don't know, something about the institution thing or something.
L:  Oh, maybe if you've [NOISE] changed how you feel.  
R:  Uh --
L:  Toward marriage, maybe.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, I had that, too, it was like bad feedback on it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, so -- but the -- you know, when I'm talking -- when I'm talking to someone else, though, I don't have that problem.
L:  Yeah, I noticed that too.
R:  [MN]
L:  I thought -- I thought it was my phone until, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] you came on clear.
R:  Right, right.  Mine -- I thought mine was like that too, but -- [SIGH] okay, let's see, the, uh, I'm still trying to click on that second one though.  Um, is -- what was that again?  It was about --
L:  I think it was if you --
R:  -- changing --
L:  -- if divorce changed your view [SIGH].
R:  Yeah, I think that was the first one.
L:  Oh, you think that was the first one?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And the second one had something to do about the institution.
L:  Oh.
R:  The institution of marriage or something like that, I don't know.  Uh, I think basically, [inaudible] [MN] we can guess that maybe these things happened in the past --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- way before, [SIGH] when society was forming, and it does seem like it's a new phenomenon for the, you know, the single parent family structure versus the nuclear unit.
L:  Yes.
R:  Versus gay and lesbian, uh, unions --
L:  Right.
R:  -- those kinds of things [SIGH].  But for me, personally, I really don't care.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know?  'Cause really the marriage is just, um, it seems -- like, most people say it's just a contract, and although it is very dear and sentimental and -- and does hold values, you know, um, we're seeing an increasing, uh, response to people wanting same sex marriages, total equality and all of that, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and basically, I -- I guess I'm for that, because [SIGH] I haven't even fell in love with anybody yet at my age, and, [MN] you know, I'm at this point to where I don't know.  [SIGH] Whoever comes and says, "I love you" first, I guess --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that they're gonna be it, you know?  And -- and chances are, with my luck, it could be anyone --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  I grew up most of my life, um, under the choice of being gay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I've also, you know, had a lotta relationships with women as well.  [MN] But I'm also a prude, so don't get me wrong --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [COUGH] thanks to my mom. 
L:  [MN]
R:  And, uh, you know, it -- it's just [SIGH] there -- there has not been one good for me relationship yet.
L:  Really?
R:  It's always been bad for me, so, [SIGH] yeah.  And I -- I just basically had to follow my mom's, uh, path.  She lived alone for a long time after she divorced my father.  Uh, she divorced my father because of infidelity --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so what else is new?  You know?  
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  So, I don't know if the [MN] -- the institution of marriage is -- is in trouble, per se, as far as it, you know, uh, abolishing it or anything like that.  I -- I don't see that happening, [SIGH] but, um, I -- I think they just, you know, people need something else.  You know, they need more than the truth and -- and I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] with family values and family planning and stuff like that, that's -- [SIGH] that's probably where we have to start, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to -- to try to get people to stop marrying for the false -- false reasons and having kids under false reasons --
L:  Well, sure.  
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  Sure.  And I do think people do value [SIGH] -- you know, there's a lot of effort that's involved.  I'm married, I have two children [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there's a lot of effort.  And it is not easy.  And, you know, sometimes I look at my husband and think, "Just go" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But --
R:  Can you imagine if you had ten --
L:  Oh [MN].
R:  -- instead of two? 
L:  No, no.
R:  [MN] 
L:  And -- and, certainly I -- I love my husband, but marriage is work.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know --
R:  It is.
L:  -- it doesn't just happen, like this is -- and [NOISE] had we given up, maybe, you know, I don't know.  I -- I think to myself, it -- you know, it's -- it's -- I think it's easier to give up than it is to continue to try. [NOISE]
R:  Well, it is, but, you know, you -- you have great blessings because of those kids and --
L:  Oh, absolutely.  [MN]
R:  -- re- regardless of what happens to them, you're -- you're gonna feel a completeness and a wholeness.  So, [SIGH] what is it that you tell yourself, you know, when it -- when it's getting rough?   How -- how -- what do you tell yourself that keeps you in the game?
L:  That I believe God has given me this husband.  I believe He -- He brought us together, and I have to [SIGH] do it jus- -- and my husband is not a -- he's not a -- a cheater.  He's not an alcoholic, he's not a drug abuser [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's not mean and nasty.  You know, I focus a lot on his positive attributes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the fact that I think I owe it my children and -- [SIGH] to -- you know, my happiness comes second to theirs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [SIGH] regardless of what he does that makes me happy or unhappy, if it's not, you know, addiction, abuse, so on and so forth --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] I owe it to them to give them the best possible start they could have. [SIGH] And I do honestly believe that even if I was completely miserable, and just the fact that maybe I stopped liking him, for example, [SIGH] I would still stay married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I believe for them [SIGH].  I -- I've seen, you know, children, so many of them -- before --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I stopped working I was a teacher, and [SIGH] the impact on their life when the mother has [several inaudible words] that I give mother a lot of credit, that she [SIGH] took care of you and raised you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- without putting her own -- you know, these -- these -- some of these people are just so [SIGH] in for themselves.  What about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- me?  My happiness --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- me, me, me [MN].
R:  [several inaudible words] the me generation [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  And that -- I think that that just produces another generation that's growing more angry, upset, you know, and [MN] --
R:  And take it out on their kids?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- and it's sad and it's, you know [SIGH] -- my faith does have a lot to do with it.  I think a lot, you know, because I have that -- all that prayer and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so on and so forth, and it makes me feel a lot better [SIGH].
R:  Well, you'll be happy to know that, uh, I'm -- me, myself, I'll -- you know, [MN] you already know my position and everything, I'm developing a software for family planning that will help people to gain the genders, uh, particular genders of the children that they would like.  Say if you wanted to have two kids, you wanted a boy and a girl --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's actually a law that, uh -- a natural law that exists --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I've finally formulated it, and so now I'm -- I'm seeking to have it put in software program.
L:  Really?
R:  Hopefully that'll be done by this year.
L:  Wow.
R:  And --
L:  That's very exciting.
R:  -- that's my contribution to, you know, to help people, uh, maintain control --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- in anything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that we don't go through all this crap of the throwaway kids --
L:  Oh, it's so sad.
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  It's so sad.
R:  You know?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  'Cause it -- someone asked me last night, said, "Well, [MN] if you're not gonna have a kid, why don't you adopt one?"  I said, "No, it doesn't work like that.  Uh, I have to have a kid first, and then after I raise that kid [SIGH] and then that kid leaves the home, then I will adopt".
L:  [MN] Really?
R:  But I have to make su- -- you know, I want -- it's more -- it -- it means more if it comes directly from you.
L:  You think?
R:  Not that I don't care --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, or have passion --
L:  I think some people --
R:  -- it's just that there's not very much I could do for a kid that -- that I have no, um --
L:   [MN] 
R:  -- connection to --
L:  Like the biological ties.
R:  -- spiritual or otherwise.  Yeah.
L:  Now, you know, it's funny you say that, because I have a friend who just adopted recently from Guatemala [SIGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, she was unable to conceive after, you know, say five years, I think it was, of trying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and she kind of, you know, she asked me, did I think I could adopt, and I think I'm against adoption for myself, although it would be second choice to my natural children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and she said she felt very strongly [inaudible] that all of a sudden she decided she wasn't trying any more, [SIGH] that she felt like maybe she was destined to be somebody else's mother --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- someone who didn't have a mother [SIGH].  She was the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- mother in her heart, kind of, so --
R:  Right, and that's good too, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, she --
L:  I wish I felt like that, to be honest.
R:  She took a negative thing and made positive, which was very good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] But I think, really, it's not -- you know, there's -- I always hear this crap, "Oh, we're fixing people one at a time" and --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  -- in terms of evolution, that's -- you know, it's never gonna be fixed.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think to really fix the -- the, you know, [inaudible] family by using up all this, uh, religious rhetoric or secular rhet- rhetoric, [SIGH] if you wanna keep it in such an indifferent attitude, that's fine, but I think the state is actually the one that really needs to, uh, come up to bat.  And, you know, because there are solutions and it can be fixed.  I just see a society that really doesn't want -- they make all these promises but they really don't wanna fix anything --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- because there's no money in it.
L:  [MN] Right, right.  
R:  Or something.
L:  Well, money is always the root of evil, really.
R:  But how could, uh, do you think Americans re- -- could really be like [NOISE] Chi- -- the Chinese and -- and invoke a law saying you can only have one kid, no matter what it is?
L:  No.  I don't think that would go over --
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  -- I don't believe it would go over too well.
R:  'Cause my software was actually developed in response to a question about population control, you know?  I got real sick and tired of seeing divorce and people using those, uh -- justifiably --
L:  Right.
R:  -- trying to use fo- -- force and coercion just to thin the herd, so to speak, and that's not right, you know?
L:  Right, they --
R:  I'm a very [NOISE] spiritual person, uh, in terms of I believe in Jesus, but I don't believe in today's church. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And, uh --
L:  Well, you know, today's church has veered so much off the path of the original Christians. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah [NOISE].  And Catholic, you know, they talk about they're against divorce, but look at what all goes on there.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  So, I just --
L:  I think that does --
R:  -- wish it could return everything.
L:  -- corrupt the institution of marriage.
