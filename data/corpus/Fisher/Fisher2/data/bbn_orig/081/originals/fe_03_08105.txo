L:  I know with traveling, I mean, we are --
R:  [NOISE]

L:  Yeah?  That's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wonderful.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I have been to Hawaii.  Um, I do [NOISE] love to travel.  It's just that people are really getting jealous around us that, um [NOISE] -- when we come back from vacation --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we're already planning another vacation. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  We're planning ours on the way back from, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, by the time we get home we are know -- we know where we're going [LAUGH] next time.
R:  Yeah.  Isn't that fun?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It's better getting depressed.  You have something else --
L:  Yep.  M- --
R:  -- to look forward to --
L:  Most definitely.
R:  -- even if --
L:  We have so much to look forward to, you know?
R:  Even if it takes you a while to, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- start traveling again.
L:  Yeah.  M- -- and I only get, you know, three weeks off for vacation so, um --
R:  Oh, that's a good amount.
L:  -- see with -- yeah.  Well, two of the weeks I like to spend traveling, um, and the other week --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, usually I putts around the house at -- at Christmas and Thanksgiving getting things ready.  Um --
R:  Oh, you're smart.
L:  So --
R:  Taking some time off through --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- well, through the hectic times.
L:  Yeah.  I'm a -- I'm a big Disney World fan so --
R:  The most.  Yeah.  I --
L:  I --
R:  -- love 'em too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've been trying to, um, ah, go down there, like, once a week -- not once a week but --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, P.A.  Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  I live in Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, do you?  Wow.
R:  And speaking of traveling, on Cape Cod. [LAUGH]
L:  I've never been there.  I heard it's --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Big tourist --
L:  -- gorgeous.
R:  -- attraction.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They'll --
L:  I have friends going back for the second time.
R:  Oh, no kidding?
L:  They're going -- yeah, they're going to Cape Cod this summer for vacation.  Yeah.
R:  Well, if you ever get with your friends one day it's a nice place to visit but don't --
L:  Oh, I heard.
R:  -- come in the winter.
L:  No.  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It is a- -- isolated.
L:  No.  I'm not a winter person anyhow.
R:  Me neither.
L:  I'm -- I'm a stay at home [LAUGH] body during the winter.  Yeah.  I collect, um, Boyd's Bears -- that's another one of my hobbies but --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- I don't -- you know, I've, kinda, slowed down there because you can only --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- put 'em so many places 'til you're, you know  ...  But --
R:  Yeah.  I had a Beanie Baby collection only because I liked them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, certain ones near my computer and then it got to be I have, like, ten of 'em, you know?  Ah, even if they're just different stuffed animals not exactly Beanie Babies but little tiny --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- things that are cute.  And then I started collected pigs.  For --
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  I guess it's a h- -- I don't know, is that a hobby?  Collecting?  Yes.  And --
L:  Yeah.  Um, I have a friend at church who probably has thousands and thousands of pigs.  Yeah.
R:  Now, I'm getting outta control with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a piggy calendar, I have piggy planters.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I have [LAUGH] piggy -- I'm getting m- -- like, I'm getting married, I got little mister and missus --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- piggy, you know, one with a veil and ... [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I'd -- I try to limit it because it's, like, god -- I live in a very -- we live in a very small house and it's, like --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- you can only put things so many places.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I try to contain my bears to one room.  That way, my husband doesn't feel he's being taken over by all this girly stuff.  You know how it is?
R:  Yeah, I know.  That's another thing --
L:  So --
R:  -- you gotta be careful of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I try to --
R:  I -- yeah, my, um, fiance started collecting hats [NOISE] and so those are congregated in the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- area where he has his computer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because those were everywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, there's some put away now because there was so many.  And he collects --
L:  Yeah.  Baseball hats?  Baseball caps?
R:  Um, yeah -- yeah.  But just from, like, where we went on vacation. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  We have to come back with a hat -- I kid you not.  You know?
R:  You know what else he comes back with besides the hat --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- is a leather jacket, like, from --
L:  Get out.
R:  -- like, Planet Hollywood --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, um, like, you know -- I don't think they had any Maui when we were -- we were down -- we were in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Hawaii too --
L:  We haven't done any --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- leather jackets.  No.
R:  No.  He got a hat though [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, so did we.
R:  -- from the -- Cheeseburgers --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in Paradise.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  We bought it in Maui. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah.  We went to Maui for a day and we did a cruise so --
R:  Oh.  Yeah.
L:  -- um, we cruised the island.
R:  See, one thing a- -- yeah.  Cruises are great -- I'm sorry, I probably keep interrupting you.
L:  No.
R:  I know we're gonna get cut off --
L:  No.
R:  -- in ten minutes.  Um, I love cruises -- that's where we're going on, um -- when we get married in Bermuda.
L:  Great.
R:  We're leaving Wednesday -- on a Wednesday and we're getting married on the Friday.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, the same thing.  It's -- I love Bermuda 'cause it's four days.
L:  Yeah.  That's great.
R:  You got the island.  Yeah.
L:  Friends and family going with or just the two of you?
R:  Um, yeah, we have -- I have two daughters and, um --
L:  Wonderful.
R:  I've -- our parents and --
L:  But they'll --
R:  -- a f- -- couple of friends.
L:  -- go on a cruise with you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is super.
R:  So, it's a total of twelve.  I mean, it's just a little party.  I mean, we tried to get more but it was, kind of, expensive, you know?
L:  Well, exactly.  And that's the way with, like, our friends and family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they really don't have the funds to just take off like we do.  Not that we're, you know -- we're --
R:  Right.  Exa- --
L:  We live comfortably, you know?
R:  Me too.
L:  And -- and we save all year for a -- a big vacation, you know?
R:  And some people can't even do that.
L:  I know.
R:  You know?
L:  I know.
R:  I know.  And that's why we get, kinda, digged by, y- you know, like, um --
L:  I know.
R:  -- relatives, "Oh, they're going again".
L:  I know.
R:  "Where are you going again?"  And then it starts --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- wearing on my fiance, like, you know, "He's going --".  "Well, Jesus, you know, we're not going anywhere for another -- for te- -- a t- --".  I'm, like, "Oh, give it up" you know?
L:  I [LAUGH] know.
R:  I said, "You relax when you go and that's the whole point".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Plus, you see different parts of the world.
L:  Exactly.  Oh, it's -- it's --
R:  I've ac- -- yeah.
L:  It's wonderful.
R:  I've been to Paris.  Um --
L:  Oh, have you really?
R:  And, um, I went to England initially.  I went to law school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we went for, like, a class trip believe it or not. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  So, um, we were supposed to stay in England and we had some time off so I went and saw Ireland, I went and saw Paris.  'Cause I figure I'm never -- I may never get back here --
L:  You might never er- -- exactly.  I know.  I have a --
R:  So --
L:  -- girlfriend in Belgium who wants me to fly over and, you know, stay a while but with the way the world is I -- I -- I said, "Ah, m- -- we'll see in a year". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  Flying, right now --
R:  You can't really --
L:  -- I'm not too crazy about.  I mean, I'll do it locally but, um, I don't really want -- wanna go overseas right now.
R:  Oh, with Bermuda, that's more of the English islands so I'm not that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- concerned but I know what you're saying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because god, they have such low airfares.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We met some people --
L:  I know.
R:  -- we were in Bahamas that wanted us to go to their vacation home in, um, [NOISE] ah, Italy and I'm, like, "Oh, man" [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah.  Any other time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Flying down to the Bahamas would not bother me really, to tell you the truth 'cause -- I don't know.  I'd -- I feel a little comfortable there but --
R:  Yeah.  We went for a week in January.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's our last trip we went on.
L:  That's great.
R:  But we weren't, like, actually financially prepared.  We had a bad winter.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My husband's a -- my husband to be is a contractor and it was just bad so --
L:  One of those times.  Yeah.
R:  -- we, kinda like, ate hot dogs and macaroni cheese. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] We stayed in the car and the h- -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and there's the beautiful Atlantis over there and, you know, we walked around and, you know, we had a few drinks but, god, the casino --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was killing us.
L:  Was it really?
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  We -- we enjoy that too.  That's, kind of, a hobby.  We try to hit, like, Atlantic City maybe twice a year, you know?
R:  Oh, I love it.
L:  And, um, you know, it's very easy to get addicted to that.
R:  I live close to Foxwoods.
L:  What's that?
R:  I live close to Foxwoods in Connecticut.
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  Well, that's the closest one --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I can get to.  Three or -- three hour [LAUGH] drive. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's about what it is here for us.
R:  Oh, no shit?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Excuse me.
L:  We usually take a --
R:  Kidding.
L:  -- bus down.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yup.
R:  We usually just drive down 'cause I don't wanna be contained a bus.  But the buses --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are fun.  I've been on them going to casinos before, especially the one at Atlantic City.
L:  Yeah.  Usually it's a bu- -- you know, forty others that know everybody, [LAUGH] you know?  So, w- --
R:  Oh, that's more fun.
L:  Yeah.  We're going with people that we know.  It's just -- you know?  But, ah, yeah, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- another hobby. [LAUGH]
R:  The only thing that happens around here for buses to Atlantic City is the VFW so they're all about sixty five and up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But we know all the people because --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- his mother's in the Women's Auxiliary and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, she goes all the time.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sh- -- I've hit, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for a thousand once.
L:  Ah.
R:  Um, seven fifty, my fiance hit.  Nothing, like, massive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know --
L:  We've hit five hundred.  That's -- that's the highest we've hit.
R:  That's -- that's fun isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  It is wonderful.
R:  Oh, my mouth drools.
L:  It pays for the trip, buy yourself a nice steak dinner, you know?  And we just live --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- it up then.  We figured, "Hey, no loss no gain" you know?
R:  Yeah.  If you hit early you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's money to play on.
L:  Hey, it's wonderful.  Most definitely.
R:  Oh, it is.  My mouth drools when I walk into a casino.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's pathetic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sometimes I can go and play on my lousy twenty bucks.  Your first twenty bucks you put it in the machine.
L:  I can too and my husband's, like, "You still have quarters left". [LAUGH]
R:  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Those are the fun times.
L:  By the end of the night and I still have quarters left. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And then if we go, like, with, um, the family and say someone's low, we call it the family pot --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- we'll just share.  We'll, you know -- so someone's always playing, you're not just standing there waiting or --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- bummed out. [LAUGH]
L:  We do that too.
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  Yeah.  But hobby wise, I guess, travel's my big thing.  I love to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- travel.  I love it.  I just love it.  My grandfather's been all over the world so I think it's in my blood, you know?
R:  Oh, could be.
L:  I mean ...
R:  I'd like to go to Fiji some day. [PAUSE]
L:  Maybe.
R:  But that's another a- --
