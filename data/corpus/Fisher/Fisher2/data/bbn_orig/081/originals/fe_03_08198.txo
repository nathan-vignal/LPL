R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  This is Cindy in Texas.
L:  This is Steve in New York.
R:  [MN] Quite a hot topic nowadays.
L:  Yeah, I guess.  I don't -- I don't know [SIGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] It's been a hot topic for a while.  I remember in high school I hadda write a paper about it.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, um, censorship, so, uh, I don't think -- I mean, I don't know.  I gu- -- I think that there has to be some kinda -- some kinda limit when they're in, like, grade school.
R:  Mm.
L:  But once they're in high school, it doesn't really -- I don't know, I think people should be able to read what the hell they want.
R:  Yeah.  So, you would be opposed to it?
L:  Yeah, pretty much.  What do you think?  Texas -- what do they do down there?
R:  Um ...
L:  They got strict laws on that kind of stuff, don't they?
R:  Yeah, well, I don't -- I don't have kids, so, you know, I'm not sure what they're doing in schools now, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that -- that, um, the books should be censored to some degree, uh, for grade school and possibly even middle school, um, but I don't think it should be left up just to, you know, a handful of people, like the [SIGH] school board or the, uh, school administration or something like that.  I think it should, [SIGH] you know, be determined by a -- a large section, you know --
L:  What, do you think the parents should have input on -- on that also?
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely, definitely.  And, you know, not just them, but community leaders and, you know, just a large sampling of people.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If you're gonna censor something, you know, that's quite a big step, so ...
L:  Well, that's true.  Well, have -- well, uh, when you went to school did y- -- I don't know how old you are or anything, but, um, [SIGH] I -- I'm -- I'm only twenty four, so I -- you know, I was in school recently.  I -- I -- we got a lot of things censored, but things that -- that were, like, silly.  Like, they -- they -- you would think -- I don't know, I thought were silly that they were censored.  Expl- -- I mean, books like Huckleberry Finn, like, books that we had to do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- censorship papers on [SIGH] that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, to me, made no sense right now.  
R:  Yeah.  Um, I had the same thing when I was in school.  Course, it's -- it's been a little while longer [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm thirty five, so, uh, but yeah, we had, um, crazy things censored, like you said, like Huckleberry Finn, or if a book had just a certain word that they thought would be offensive to -- to, um, you know, people of other races, just for that one word the entire book was -- was shut out of the library.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I don't -- [MN] I don't think that -- that that's right, um --
L:  [inaudible] outta the library, it also wasn't just outta, like, the school's -- it was just complete, like --
R:  No, I mean --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- I mean the school library.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  
R:  Yeah.  But I don't know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like I said, I don't have kids, [MN] you know, so --
L:  Right, yeah.  I don't have -- I don't have children either, but I mean, I can -- I can remember -- I mean, it's the same thing with -- the same thing with censorship with -- with the television or something.  It's -- it's -- I think it -- I think it comes down to -- I think it fully comes down to parental knowledge of stuff.  As long as they know what their -- as long as they know what their kids are reading, they should have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, it's -- it's their children.  They should have, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the right to, uh -- and, you know, to throw out their opinion on all that stuff anyways.
R:  Yeah.  Well, in -- and, you know, different -- different parents teach different things in their homes, so --
L:  Well, true, that's -- [MN] I mean, you know, that's what I mean.  So, you know, one parent might think it's -- it's a good idea to censor a book and another parent might say, "Well, what's the point?"
R:  Yeah.  Or, that -- that's a really good book, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Right, yeah, yeah, I know.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Like, maybe some -- some parents are completely all for it.  I don't know, I think that -- I think the parents would have [SIGH] -- I think that -- that the way that they should do it is -- is parents should have a really good part in it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, because if it is just -- I mean, I don't know, 'cause it's all bureaucracy an- an- and politics and all that crap come -- come into play with a lotta stuff.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  That's -- I mean, with schools and stuff, and it -- and [SIGH] half the time it has nothing to do with [SIGH] -- with the literature itself.
R:  Right.  
L:  And -- and the points that are supposed to be across.  I mean, [SIGH] Huckleberry Finn is written in a vernacular, like, in -- you know, in the way that it was, uh, she treated to write it the way that people spoke --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at that time, and that had nothing to do with anybody's race or anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like that, I mean, [MN] you know?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just the way it was.  But everything's gotta be, you know, public- [LAUGH] -- politically correct now.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's -- that's a big thing now.  
L:  [MN] I mean, and also, like, violence and stuff.  I mean, violence in books is -- I don't know -- I don't know effects -- I mean, 'cause I hadda write a censorship paper on [SIGH] -- I wrote a paper on, uh, [MN] The Outsiders, which is a movie also --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they made a movie out of it.  But, um, I mean, it has -- it's riddled with violence --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's about gangs.  And, uh, I mean, I think to some degree, like I said, a grade schooler shouldn't be reading it, but -- but if you're in high school, I mean, why the hell not?  
R:  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't make sense to -- to keep things out of the school library that you can just turn on the TV and see.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Or, you know, go to the movies and see.
L:  Right.  I mean, in how -- actually [MN] people are watching more TV than they're reading nowadays anyways.
R:  Right.  
L:  [SIGH] So, I don't know.  Censorship is -- is a big deal in general, but I think [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I wouldn't -- I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to, like, some kinda national rating system like they have, you know, advisory labels on records and things, um, just like movies are rated and -- and, you know, it's --
L:  Oh, just to let people know that this is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what you're getting.  This is --
R:  Yeah, you know, there're -- there're gonna be, you know, off color words in there, there're gonna be violence or sex or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then, you know, maybe can -- parents can stay a little bet- better informed that way.
L:  That's actually a good idea, yeah.  I mean, I'm somebody's thought of that, why aren't they doing it?  
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Who knows?
R:  -- politics, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [MN] we're kinda running outta steam here.  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] we're kind of agreeing, so it's, like, you're not ev- -- you know?  
R:  Yeah, that's true.  
L:  Um --
R:  I was hoping I didn't get somebody that I totally disagreed with, you know?
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  It would have been fun, then --
R:  Argue for --
L:  -- to argue for [inaudible].
R:  -- argue for ten minutes.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [SIGH] [MN] -- uh, let's see --
R:  So, basically, we both agree censorship -- censorship to some degree, but not just, uh --
L:  Well, censorship -- censorship -- I guess it's -- I don't know.  I don't even know if in some degree.  [SIGH] I -- I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I just think that -- I just think that [SIGH] -- that the -- that it should have to do with, I mean, [MN] it sho- -- I don't know who should be making the decision of -- of what people shoul- -- what kids should be able to see and what kids should be able to read and what they shouldn't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I don't -- I don't wanna make the decision, and I don't think anyone really else should either, except for maybe their parents.
R:  [MN] Okay.  
L:  Uh, I mean, I -- I mean, seriously, if their parents want them at, you know, ten years old to read smut magazines or something, let 'em freaking read it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I -- it's -- you know?  They're not my kids.
R:  Yeah.  Unfortunately, though, there are -- there are probably quite a few parents out there that would let their kids read that, you know?
L:  Well -- well, you know what, though?  That's their -- that's not, you know, that's them, that's not me.  And if they're provocative, I guess, and they shouldn't be -- I mean, if that's what they wanna do, then -- then, I guess [SIGH] -- I don't know though, 'cause then to some extent, the -- it's -- it could screw the kid up or something, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH] Maybe they'll go shooting people or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] See, that's the thing too, I mean, is -- is that why this is such a big topic?  Is that why we're talking about it?  Because kids are doing some crazy nowadays or what?  
R:  Uh, that's -- I don't know, that's the only thing I could figure.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Or could -- it could be about, you know, how they're, um, changing the history textbooks now to, um, take out certain parts.
L:  Are they really?
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Um, like, um, they're changing it to -- to say that, you know, like, when Thomas Jefferson was, uh, involved in writing the Declaration of Independence and all this, he -- he prayed for a long time, um, you know, asking God to give him guidance and things like that.  Well, they're -- they're taking that out of the textbooks --
L:  Oh, because it's religion?
R:  -- [inaudible].  Yeah, any mention of religion, you know, even us coming over here and founding this country because of religious oppression we were under over there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're taking all of that out.
L:  Wow.  
R:  So --
L:  That doesn't make any sense.
R:  No.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Man, see, I try not to keep up on what's going on [NOISE] with the world [SIGH] [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, uh, I -- I like -- I like -- [MN] I'm blissfully ignorant most of the time [SIGH] [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH].  I try not to watch too much news, but --
L:  Right, yeah --
R:  -- it can get really depr- --
L:  -- exactly.  I don't -- I don- -- I don't need to get depressed about stuff I have nothing to do with.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH] Um, but, uh, back to censorship, I would say, uh, well, yeah, pretty much.
R:  Like you -- you think, you know, parents should just call the shots and --
L:  Well, I think, yeah, I mean, I think if the parents are watching out for their kids in the first place then -- then, you know, whatever repercussions they would -- would occur from anything is -- is -- is gonna be taken care of by the parents if -- if they're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- actually paying attention [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe there should be some sanction on the parents instead of sanctions on what, you know, materials and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I guess that's a little harder, but --
R:  Yeah, that'd be a lot harder.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].
R:  But, you know, it's a -- it's an option.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [MN] Uh --
L:  Apparently it's not, 'cause nobody's trying it yet.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well.  They're not trying my idea of the rating system either.
L:  Yeah, why not?  
R:  [MN] Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, how easy would that be?  Come on, they're books, they've been around forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just take them out -- they wouldn't notice -- [several inaudible words] people that know probably every book in [SIGH] -- ever written [MN].
R:  Yeah, or people that have read the same book, you know, twenty, thirty, forty times.
L:  Right [SIGH].  [MN] I don't know, I think it's kind -- it's, I don't know -- well, see, censorship is -- is a big deal in general because it's, you know, freedom of speech and all that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all that jazz [SIGH] about, you know, constitutional blah blah blah.  But the constitution's getting all screwed up.  I mean, everybody's -- nowadays --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everything's --
