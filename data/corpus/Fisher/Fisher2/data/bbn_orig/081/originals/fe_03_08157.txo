L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Natalie.
R:  Natalie?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm Sharon.
L:  Oh, nice to meet you.
R:  Oh, same here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I --
L:  So, how do you -- go ahead.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I was just going to say, I'm not certain what the -- the topic of the day is.
L:  Oh, it's about the -- the increase in the divorce rate.  How does it affect you?
R:  Okay.  That's what she said when she came on, but they had told me while I was holding, ah, what I thought would contribute to family -- family values.
L:  Oh.
R:  And you're the third person, I mean, third try before they could get anyone to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to talk.  I was getting ready -- I'd -- almost forgotten them.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And my call waiting had beeped and everything else, ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  So, what are your thoughts on the subject?
R:  Now, on the increase of divorce, how has it affected me, right?
L:  Yeah.  How does it affect your opinion of like marriage and divorce?
R:  Well, of course it's too easy to get.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Very much too easy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I don't thi- -- I thi- -- I think that the people um say, "Oh, well, we'll get -- we'll get married and if we can get -- make it, we'll get a divorce" I think the attitude is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is too easy -- so I guess it'd also be it's too easy to get married.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Ah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I agree [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Other than that, I'm divorced, so I don't have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] too much to say as far as --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, ah -- what to do about it.
L:  Right.
R:  But ah I do think it -- it ah is, in my opinion, yes ah f- fam- family values and that have changed.  See, they threw me a curve because I -- I didn't know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so talk, I'll listen.
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].  Um, my opinion on divorce is exactly what you said, actually.  I'm going through a divorce right now and um if it was up to me, I would have hung in there and fought, you know, to the death to keep him and keep our marriage going, but he gave up very easily --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I um I really think it's too easy to get a divorce and I think you should have to go through some kind of counselling, whether it be church counselling or, you know, non religious, I mean for me, personally, I -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I prefer church counselling, but I --
R:  Well, same -- same here except I hung out till the last dog was hung.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it was miserable, we were miserable.
L:  Oh.
R:  It did absolutely no good and he wouldn't go to counselling whatsoever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he was happy the way things were.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Exactly.  How long were you married?
R:  Ah, thirteen years.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, ah, it was, like I said, it was -- it was the exact opposite, so those examples --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not [MN] don't seem -- didn't seem to make any difference, you know --
L:  Right.  Were you guys young when you married?
R:  No, no, no.  Ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was my second, ah, marriage --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so I had made up my mind I was not going to fail again --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- come no matter what, but it took me a long time to realize it takes two to try.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if one doesn't try and doesn't change and is just happy the way things are [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you kinda have a standstill, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what can you do?  And so -- and of course I knew he was going to fight me for everything we had --
L:  Oh, geeze.
R:  -- every i- -- you know, every stick of furniture, every item, ev- --
L:  Mm.
R:  Because that's the way he was.
L:  Wow.  So, are you -- do you think you'll ever get married again?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.  I -- I -- I have no intentions of getting married again.  Twice was enough and --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  -- ah I've gro- I've -- I've been divorced for about five, six years --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and so I've grown accustomed to being on my own.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Eating when I want to eat --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sleeping when I want to sleep --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all the -- the conveniences of not having to cater to a man --
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  -- and so -- ah -- ah -- a friend, a lover, maybe, but not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I have no intentions of ever getting married again.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, if you have, good luck, because --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I'm scared to death of it now, so --
R:  Well, that's what I mean.  I --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I have no desire to -- to get in that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- position again.
L:  Right.
R:  Come to the conclusion that a lot of it must be -- well, I was raised with old fashioned values --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he wasn't.  He had very ah open attitudes and -- and so forth and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah he didn't want -- he didn't really want to partake of the marriage, he wanted me to take care of it all --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- "Do what you want" you know --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and it didn't matter, just he did pro- he did give me his ch- paycheck --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but that was all he gave me [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  And so ah I -- I thought, "No", not never again, no.  I -- I have a bad ah made bad choices, I think, with marriage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I [inaudible] firstly he was -- the first one was a physical abuser, the second was a emotional and mental abuser --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  -- and I -- I said, he -- I mean in fact he said to me, "Well, you've had both now, tell me which is worse" --
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  -- and I said, "Well, the mental and psychological abuse is worse" I said, "When someone hits you, you know you've been hit".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "But when it's mental and psychological, you keep thinking 'Oh, he didn't mean that' --"
L:  Oh.
R:  "-- 'I took it wrong'" or different things in -- in that area [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] But ho- I'm -- I'm quite content to -- to ah live on my own.
L:  Oh.
R:  But ah you're -- you're afraid of marriage too, then?
L:  Oh yeah.  Well, I -- I got married when I was twenty two and now I'm thirty and I'm at the end of a divorce and it's like I thought he was the one forever [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was totally convinced of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so was everyone else around us.  So --
R:  Well, we -- we was the -- the -- [inaudible] because you see, I did it twice, you only done -- you've only been married once.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But with the second one, we were the ideal American family.
L:  Oh.
R:  The dog, the station wagon, the -- the -- the kid, the big house in the country I mean --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- everything.  And of course when -- when you get -- when you do get a divorce you end up losing everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- no matter how you look at it, you know.  And I just thought all those ah ten, twelve years that I worked I thought, no way, I'm not -- I'm not going to even -- I have no desire to own a home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I have no desire to get married again.  I'm in -- I -- I've been there, done it twice and I -- I -- forget it.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] I live in a high rise apartment.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I have a maintenance man that I just drop a little note and it's fixed, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I said, no, I have no desire and a- a- as far as um I think there's a lot of women that way.
L:  Yes.
R:  Once you become -- once you get past the first couple of years and you've learned to be on your own and to cope and manage and I have a garage and I -- that takes care of my car and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so ah it's just not worth the -- the -- the upheaval --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of going through marriage all and going through it all over again.  And I find that men today just do not -- they're not like my father [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, tell me about it.  I know.  Exactly.
R:  I mean, I had a marvellous father and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah -- he -- he worked hard, he was a good provider, he was a good father --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he, you know, all the -- the things that you would want and I -- I -- I -- I look and I look and I look at my friends' boyfriends and that too and I don't see anyone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really don't.
L:  I agree.
R:  I mean, I think [PAUSE] I think it's ah my opinion it's just a flaw in the um American male.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they were -- they weren't raised to be ah providers and --
L:  That's true, yeah.
R:  -- they -- they were p- pampered babies and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a- and they don't take responsibility, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can go on [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I agree.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's a big problem with my age group [LAUGH].
R:  There's no one available.
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know what the --
L:  This stinks [LAUGH].
R:  You know, the -- the -- the ones that are -- are -- are -- that was the problem with the second one, you see --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because it was -- there was no one available at the time and I had really thought, "Oh well, I'll just be divorced my whole life, it's the way I'm going to live" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then all out of the blue he came along and I thought, "Ooh" --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I mean, quiet, well mannered, everything.  Never raised his hand to me, very seldom ever raised his voice --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but he was very [inaudible] which I [inaudible] because I had not associated with that type of man --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- did not realize that he was withdrawn, cold --
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  -- distant and -- and everything that goes along with that, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so like I said, I -- and so I
