R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Yvette.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  I'm Jacquie.
L:  Good.
R:  You said your name is Yvette?
L:  Correct.
R:  What?  Sorry?
L:  Yes, Yvette.
R:  Oh, Yvette.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  [MN] Where are you from?
L:  I'm from New- well, [MN] originally from New York, but I'm in Jersey now.  And yourself?
R:  Oh, I'm in Florida.
L:  Wow.
R:  Way down here in south Florida.  Isn't that where most people from New York, New Jersey are?
L:  Yeah, basically, yeah.  Yeah, just about.
R:  Is down here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Except for I'm a native.  I'm a rare breed down here.
L:  Oh.  Look at -- I -- 
R:  There's very few of me.  [MN]
L:  Oh.  I just got back from there in May actually.
R:  Oh really?
L:  I went to [several inaudible words] to one week to Orlando.
R:  Oh, do you have family down here?  Or are you just at Disney?
L:  No, just visiting.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [inaudible] well, just visiting Mickey Mouse.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That's it, like they all do.  So, how do- is this your first time doing one of these things?
R:  [NOISE] No, it's my second time.  How about you?
L:  Oh, actually my third.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Oh, it's your last opportunity then, isn't it?
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Mhm.  Yes.
R:  Well, that's cool.
L:  Yes.
R:  I did one, I forget what it was about, a while ago, I was kinda -- I don't know, it was wei- -- it was a tough -- a tough subject to talk about --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, but let's face it, drug testing?  I don't know, that's not as tough [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, how do you feel on that subject? [MN]
R:  Um, how do I feel?  I feel like it's necessary in today's world.
L:  Oh yeah.  No, I [inaudible] --
R:  I feel like it's very necessary and I don't necessarily feel like it's an invasion of privacy.  If you've taken the responsibility of having the -- a job, you've taken the responsibility of [LAUGH] the, you know, the chance of having to be tested.
L:  Yes.  Especially -- I feel the same way.  I feel strongly about it because um especially let's say people who -- who work for the public --
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  -- you know, somebody who's driving your children to school or operating a train, you know --
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  -- bus [MN] --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  They're very res- they -- they need to be held responsible. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And if -- if random drug testing is the way to hold them responsible, then so be it.
L:  I -- I mean they do it for the medical field, I mean I'm a nurse and we -- I know they do it for like nurses and doctors --
R:  So, you've got --
L:  -- yeah, from time to time.
R:  Good [LAUGH].  Good, because let's [inaudible] -- let's face it, we've all heard the terrible rumors of how nurses and or doctors have access to medications and tend to have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, wind up with addicted -- addictive situations.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they do.  They definitely -- a lot of people just say that um you know this random drug testing dah dah is an invasion of their privacy and I'm like, "Well, this is my m- the way I see it is you have nothing to hide" you know --
R:  Right.  Then, w- yeah, what's the problem?
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  I mean if y- -- if you don't have anything to hide, you won't be afraid of it.  Not only that, you're inva- I mean, by invading your privacy, I'm doing a little something to secure my safety [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  You know.  Especially in, like you said, in the medical field, or a school bus driver driving my children back and forth --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- or a teacher with my children.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't want it.
L:  No, exactly.
R:  And I don't do it in my home, what makes you think that I want my children to leave my home and be exposed to it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  If you -- if you want to do that then become, you know, a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a lab rat.
R:  Yeah, right.  Ah, yeah.
L:  And test all the drugs you want.
R:  Right.  Um, just go ahead and be a loser, but be a loser some place else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not around me, not around my family, but accept responsibility for it.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, people think, oh, you know, they're gonna hide from it and [MN] sorry.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they can be -- they can have it and then they're not even the gonna, if they know that it's coming, yeah, obviously they can hide -- anybody can hide it [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but if you don't know that it's coming, I mean, you know --
R:  R- oh, yeah.  There's no hiding.  Well, there's certain things also that you can't hide, from what I'm told, I don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, we -- let's face it, we've all heard the story about the coca- cocaine and the poppy seeds and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
L:  Right.
R:  But I mean I guess there is a degree to which you can hide it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but there again I suppose that's why the random is more necessary than -- than announced drug test.
L:  Yeah.  But I like to know who -- who -- who all the people who are basically making a big deal of it, it's usually what the youngsters, the old people, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I doubt it's anybody, you know, old, yeah [several inaudible words] I'm saying older --
R:  Right.
L:  -- meaning in their forties, you know --
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  -- probably somebody who was in their twenties, maybe early thirties --
R:  Right.  But you know what, why would, like you said, why -- who are these people and why -- w- why be opposed to it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just don't understand why being opposed to it.  If you want to be opposed to ah to a violation of your privacy, well let's be opposed to having our homes random searched or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like they did the other day about the, you know, the same s- same -- same sex sex --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I know that sounds not right, but you know, for men having sex with each other and stuff like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well [LAUGH] for me to be arrested for that, if I'm in my own home, there's an invasion of privacy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To me, that's different.  W- 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  That is different, to come into your home, knock on your door, [inaudible] have you had any marijuana today?  And what kind?
R:  [LAUGH] P- 
L:  Yes.  But anybody basically and it's usually -- I think it's big companies, people who are doing a service to the public --
R:  Right, that are more concerned with it?
L:  Right.
R:  [several inaudible words] has it.  They have it posted right on um -- right on their front door.
L:  Oh yeah, like -- and like I want it so [several inaudible words] can you cut this wood three quarters --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and an inch and have the guy high as hell and say, "Oh, my finger" --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I -- I don't think so.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I'm not going to be --
R:  Right.  I laugh, but it's not funny, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the analogy is hysterical, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the reality of it is, yeah, that's the truth and then on top of that, the drug -- the workplace has to take responsibility for the -- for an accident that's being caused under their roof --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then, you know, you've got workman's comp --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and blah -- and the reality of it is, perhaps it was an avoidable incident.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, maybe if Joe Blow hadn't been stoned out of his gourd he wouldn't have cut his finger off.
L:  No, exactly.  The thing is that hopefully they won't charge you a little extra [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- say, "Listen, I paid a dollar ninety nine per square foot, that thumb was, you know, just thrown in there, it wasn't something that I ordered, or anything like that" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but no, they don't -- they -- like I said and I've had, like I said, I'm a nurse, so I have -- but I work for a private doctor, I'm the same [inaudible] like as you know last thing I want is to go under the knife to have let's say ah a breast reduction, breast in -- in -- also come out and you just, you know, did surgery on ACL on my knee when that's not the reason that I went in there for.
R:  Right.  Ex- right.  Because --
L:  I was like -- you know, okay, I wasn't hired, but what about you?
R:  [LAUGH] Thank you.
L:  You know, I -- I was high after I came in, when you gave me all that medication, I wasn't high before then.
R:  Right.  And I trusted you.
L:  And I --
R:  I trusted you to take responsibility and to be responsible and to not use narcotics or whatever the case may be --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- and [MN] you know, screw up my life.
L:  No.  Exactly.
R:  Because the reality of it is, they can destroy your life.
L:  Yeah, no, well just --
R:  You know --
L:  -- doing them -- themselves you know, will destroy your life and like -- like I said, you know, you agree, when you're dealing with the public, like I said --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I have two children and the last thing I want to hear is that -- that oh, you know, did you hear that the Rudy the bus driver, you know, passed away this weekend?  Really?  From what?  Um --
R:  He ODd.
L:  Over -- ah, yeah.  I'd be like, oh, you know -- you got to be like --
R:  [MN] Oh yeah.
L:  -- that's the guy who drove my kids every single day --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you don't know.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You know?  You don't know.
R:  You're right.  You're right.  Espec- right.  Ah, you know, when you're dealing with the public, that's a tough situation.
L:  Mhm.  That's a b- exactly.  At home, like I said --
R:  It's very --
L:  -- factory wor- factory workers, I mean p- people who are --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- working machinery, hello --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- the last thing I want is to get, you know, a little thing that says "Made in China" you know, a little knickknack and all of a sudden you find a finger in there because the guy, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] Who wasn't paying attention.
L:  -- who did it -- yeah.
R:  Well, not only that, plus he's got to be responsible for the safety of his coworkers as well.
L:  Right.  No, exactly --
R:  You know?
L:  -- that's it.  Also for the safety --
R:  If somebody's not on their toes because you know, because they're stoned or even that they're hungover --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- you know that -- and so they're not being responsible so it costs somebody else as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- I mean, we're not a nation to have to -- to deal with that and yeah, [MN] you choose to live here and you choose to take on the responsibilities of the country and you know what [LAUGH] guess what?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's one of the responsibilities now.  And who made it that way?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I didn't.  I certainly didn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- make it that way.  My parents may have led to it, I don't know, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but unfortunately it's the country I live in and fortunately it's my children that live here with me and these are the choices that I've decided to make by living here.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know, maybe in Japan and China, maybe they don't do it, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, well, you know, it's a little harder over there.  You catch doing drugs, they cut off your hand, they -- you -- they catch you a second time, they cut off your other hand.  Oh well, there goes that habit.
R:  Do they really? [LAUGH]
L:  You know, no, in -- in Turkey I think they do it.  Um, you know, like stealing, they chop off one hand.  And if you're caught stealing a second time, they chop off the other hand.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, hello, you're not going to get -- I can guarantee that guy's not going to get caught stealing for the third time.
R:  [LAUGH] No doubt.
L:  You can't, you know.  But it's --
R:  Hey, there's an idea, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That might be an idea who's time has come, tell you the truth.  I mean, think about it [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we could really do a lot of change around here with an idea like that.
L:  Okay, let's not overdo it now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- let's [several inaudible words] oh, you know, [inaudible] somebody gave me marijuana, I personally have never done drugs, so I -- I -- I just --
R:  Right, yeah.  I don't -- yeah. 
L:  -- I don't know, so --
R:  That's how I am too [MN].
L:  So, I'm like, you know, no.  But you know, I mean something drastic, like I say, anybody who deals with the public I feel --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stronger --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not to say that I don't feel the same way about anybody else --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, what a job, but the people, the public --
R:  Right.
L:  -- period.  The guy who's operating the you know, or you know, Walt Disney or, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the Back to the Future ride, you know --
R:  But you know what?  What -- in what job do you not, ultimately in what job do you not deal with the public [MN]?
L:  E- the -- 
R:  Think about it.  There's very few.
L:  The guy who --
R:  Computer programming?
L:  Yeah, n- not even you know, the secretary who answers the phones.  You know, for the computer programming company.
R:  Right.  Right.  I mean, but there's very few jobs out there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you don't deal with the public.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, no, it's -- it's -- it's very -- it's more --
R:  But then again, w- -- would making it legal be the answer?
L:  No, not at all.  But I definitely, you know, that -- that, you know, I -- I -- not that I was opposed, but, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I wasn't too hot when they had in -- just in New York, which I'm -- I'm from New York, where they had, you know, just to stop the spread of Aids, you know, they started giving needles --
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  -- clean needles because the spread of Aids, one of the things besides homosexuality, um, is um sharing needles --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so if you don't share the needles, you can't get Aids, so what do they do?  They went up there and they gave clean needles.  Well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- junkies who wanted it, you know, could have the clean needles.  My thing is, you know, that's -- that's still, you know, you're giving them the okay.
R:  Right.  I can see that --
L:  Yeah, it's safer --
R:  -- was what I was going to say.  Now are we giving them the okay to do that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  By giving them the clean needle.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Right.  So, we're telling them --
L:  You know, they're like, oh --
R:  -- that's it okay and the reality of it is, no. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, yeah.  Exactly.  It's like, no, you know, it isn't and if you do do that, please don't, you know, drive the bus.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  Or take the bus, or, you know, or --
R:  [LAUGH] Right and --
L:  -- or work around people --
R:  -- don't -- don't put my
