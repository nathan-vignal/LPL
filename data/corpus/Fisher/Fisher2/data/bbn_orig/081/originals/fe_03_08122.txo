L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hi.  My name is Shelly.
R:  Hi Shelly.  My name is Etherley[?].  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  Um, d- -- pretty much, can you just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I didn't hear too clear what the topic was about.  It's about --
R:  It's about smoking and I think we're supposed to talk --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- about how we feel about the recent moves ban smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I didn't quite hear the rest of it.  Did you?
L:  [LAUGH] Not quite as you so [LAUGH] -- but, pretty much, I think it's, like, um, I -- I, kinda, caught the gist of it is whether or not we agree with, um, you know, if they should have campaigns, ah, like, with events[?] also[?], you know, to, I guess, educate people about n- not smoking in public places or stuff like that --
R:  Was there something about seeking non smoking help or something or ...?
L:  -- and if we agree with things like that.  But, um ... [PAUSE]
R:  Huh.
L:  I don't know.  I didn't quite hear that part. [LAUGH] It -- mm.  But, um, mainly about --
R:  A- ah --
L:  -- h- -- what is your take on smoking in public places?
R:  I don't know.  I have mixed feelings because I did quit for six years and then I started again.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the reason I started was because I was around so much smoke anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I think there's so many other pollutants in the air --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and I've known people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who smoked and lived to be eighty, ninety years old.  And then I've known others who have lung problems that aren't smokers.
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I feel like it's ...  If I'm owning the restaurant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or bar I would be very upset because it does affect your customers, how many people you will have once ...  Like, F- Florida, they banned smoking in the public places now and that's where I live.  So, um, I think it's one more thing that curtails --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- people's freedom.
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  But I don't mind smoking outside.  You know, and I'm -- I'm pretty considerate about it.  I -- I've never met anyone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that really smoked --
L:  Uh, mhm.
R:  -- up a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- storm and made it unbearable.
L:  Uh. [PAUSE] Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] They [LAUGH] -- that's true.  Um, freedom -- I mean, I -- I've never smoked in my life but, um, I had an uncle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that died a few months back.  He -- he was, um, a heavy smoker and he, um, died from lung cancer.  So, yeah, pretty much -- I mean, it -- it -- it has hit close to home, you know, the ramifications of -- of this, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- but the thing is, I mean, you know, and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he left his family and, I mean, they were distraught and what not but the thing is, all his life he smoked, you know?  And, um, you think it's -- I mean, it is a health issue --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  I mean, and I know -- I mean, even though I'm -- I'm a non smoker, I mean, I'm not against people that smoke because, I mean, everyone has their preferences.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, pretty much, I think if it, um -- I just say, I don't mind people smoking outside and stuff like that, you know?  Bu- -- unless they're considerate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of their surroundings, you know?  But, um, one -- for me personally, once I -- once, um, it could be like a -- a health issue for me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it, kinda, you know, s- s- se- sends a message home to me, you know, and it's that, um -- I mean, I'm -- I'm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- very much aware of, you know, what second hand smoke does and stuff like that.  And, um, I know when I had my child I was very careful -- when I had my baby very careful of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- having her around, you know, people that smoked and stuff like that and, um ...  But the same time, they were considerate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I mean, it was my responsibility to be aware and take preventative action, you know?  And, um ...  So, the thing is, I mean, I -- I, kinda, sound[?] -- say that you have mixed m- -- emotions and it's, um -- so do I, you know?  But, um --
R:  I- it -- but there's no smoking in restaurants or bars.
L:  -- the thing is, I guess a lotta people would be of -- skeptical of the fact of --
R:  There aren't smoking, non smoking areas anymore.
L:  -- of the -- the -- the bill that they have just passed.  Pretty much -- what is it -- what -- what is it -- what is it they have just passed?
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause then it's --
R:  I think it is too.  I recognize it's a health hazard.  I also know that if I smoke, I smoke out of my own --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- choice and my own responsibility.
L:  Well, I'm -- I mean, that -- that's --
R:  But I do know I have friends who have been pregnant and smoke or not smoked.
L:  -- that -- that -- that's, kinda, extreme, [LAUGH] you know?  Seeing as how -- I --
R:  You know, like you're saying, they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- protecting their children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And certainly, they've found it enough to see that it is harmful.
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  And I know it's not very logical to say, but so are a lot of other things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we do.  And they say second hand smoking is worse than smoking.
L:  Yes.  Yes. [PAUSE] Mhm.  Yes.  Mm. [PAUSE]
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE]
L:  I know. [PAUSE] Yes, I -- and that's -- I've heard that.  So, um, the thing is I don't if I -- I think they could have probably given, um, the -- the -- like, the restaurants and bars a -- an, option to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, design rearrange their places differently so that ...  I mean, when you go in a restaurants it's -- there's smoking and non smoking anyway so you might just -- just maybe a little --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] door or just a few tables.  It's like the [several inaudible words] in the two sections, you know?  But, um, I think instead of going --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this extreme way and ban completely, they could've probably, you know, given these places the options to, I don't know, design their rooms differently --
R:  It's pretty hard to do.
L:  -- or --
R:  I know.  It's --
L:  -- have the -- the smokers --
R:  It does spoil -- they say that now the food will taste better.
L:  -- or -- or non smokers in a con- -- more of a contained area --
R:  And it -- and I know that --
L:  -- so that --
R:  -- when I repainted my apartment, my walls were orange from the cigarette smoke so --
L:  -- you know, so I'm saying, um -- so it -- so it prevents second hand smoke coming across on -- from one side to the other.
R:  -- that had to be gross.  And I'm glad they're --
L:  But, um -- I don't know.  It --
R:  -- they're educating young people so less and less --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- smoking. [PAUSE] Mhm.
L:  You think?  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  We m- -- uh-huh.  Mhm.  Oh. [LAUGH] Yes.  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes.  Mhm.  W- which is a good thing.
R:  I don't think so.
L:  It -- it's definitely a good thing.
R:  And so I -- to be honest w- with you -- I voted for the ban on smoking myself --
L:  And, um ...  But, I don't know.  I mean, I -- like -- like you say, th- this is extreme, you know?
R:  -- because I know it bothers a lotta people.
L:  Why they have -- the bill that they have passed and, um --
R:  There are more people that are bothered than not so ...
L:  I don't know.  I think a lotta people are gonna kick up a fuss about it.  But, um --
R:  What bothers -- you know, when I used to go out, bought up some things, I'd light a smoke --
L:  I don't know at this point if there's any redress, like, you know?
R:  -- and I think that's --
L:  If --
R:  -- gonna be, kind of, strange.
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Uh-huh.  Mhm. [PAUSE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  Yes.  And, um, I think that -- mhm.
R:  Right.
L:  Yes. [PAUSE] Yes.  I know.  It's, like, um -- I mean, up there, I guess -- I don't know.  Th- they could have, probably, maybe stopped it in the restaurants or in the -- and allowed it in bars or something.  I don't know if there's, like, um, a different atmosphere, you know?  And, um -- 'cause in a bar you're not gonna have your children there and stuff like that, you know?  So that you can have, um -- well, at least allow, like, a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like bars for smokers or -- you know, and then you have your bars for your non smoker.  I mean, they -- they will make money because the -- the two different types of people will go to the individual bar.  But the thing is --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- um, I can see --
R:  And what about --
L:  -- that --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  What about the science?
L:  -- the -- the owners of these establishments --
R:  Why -- why can't they develop cigarettes that is non smoking --
L:  -- would, um -- it would be a -- a shortfall for them because, I mean -- I mean, people will go out anyhow you take it but the thing is --
R:  -- or that produces some kind of a beneficial gas?
L:  -- if, um, individual can -- I know that can -- and I have -- I go into a restaurant and I just can't smoke, I mean, I may as well just stay home and -- and have my din- -- yeah, you know?  So, it [NOISE] -- mhm. [NOISE] Mhm. [PAUSE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You -- I don't know.  Um --
R:  A- -- they -- they have light and ultra light and they may, one day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- come up with something.  They have all these --
L:  Mm.  I don't know.  I think, um -- I'm -- I'm --
R:  -- ah, quit smoking aids and medications.
L:  You know, if you -- you could probably do research there's probably something in the works or s- -- they probably have something that may be better but I don't know if, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if, you know, the -- the regular [LAUGH] cigarettes probably make more money.  It -- it might be -- I don't know.  You just never know what's --
R:  I'm sure it affects the tobacco farmers immensely too.
L:  -- you know, what they have but ... [PAUSE] Mhm. [PAUSE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] That's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- true.  So -- so that mean the technology --
R:  No, go ahead.  I'm sorry.
L:  -- is there, you know, to, um -- to come up with -- with diverse products, you know?  And, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm sure they probably have something. [PAUSE] Yes.  Very much so. [LAUGH] Very much so because [LAUGH] -- you know, so that -- that's probably a factor in why it's -- it's not on the market, you know?  So, and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The thing is -- mm?
R:  Now, what the -- state are you calling from?
L:  Pardon?  And so, the thing is --
R:  Oh, Georgia.  Okay.
L:  -- I mean, they -- they're gonna just do anything that's gonna keep the proceeds --
R:  Ah, South Florida.
L:  -- in their pockets, you know?  And, um, i- if it's -- 
R:  Very hot, very humid.
L:  -- it's -- it's not all that relevant or ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  It's, like, you know, it's -- it's gonna be a big issue for them or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I think they will probably go to the -- just, pretty much, the only money making side of it.
R:  Oh, Atlanta's beautiful.  Now, their smoking area in the airport is --
L:  You know?
R:  -- unbearable.
L:  I [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, it's just gross.
L:  Atlanta.  Where are you from?  Oh. [LAUGH] What's -- what's the weather like there now? [PAUSE] Very hot?  Oh.  Well, it -- it's hot here but, um, we've been having a lotta rain so sometimes it's a little chilly, you know?  But not that much.  But, ah ... [NOISE] [PAUSE] Oh. [PAUSE] I know.  I know. [LAUGH] I -- I know.  It's really ridiculous.  But the thing is, um, I guess they'll -- th- they soon won't have any area at all.  But, um -- yeah, I -- I know.  It's, like, um -- I think some people --
