L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  This is Cheryl Sussman[?].  I'm in New York.
L:  Your name is Shelly?
R:  Cheryl.  Right.
L:  Cheryl?
R:  A- --
L:  Hi Cheryl.  My name is June and I'm in Texas.
R:  Oh.  And I'm in New York.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  How's the weather today?
L:  Okay. [NOISE] H- hot. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it's raining here.
L:  Very hot here.
R:  It's raining here.
L:  Well, send the rain this way.  Send the rain this way.  Well, ah, Cheryl, I unders- -- I think I understood that --
R:  Is smoking.
L:  -- topic was [NOISE] smoking and, um, I know there's a lotta controversy with, ah, banning it.  Austin is a -- an area that's -- they've banned smoking just about everywhere --
R:  Well, Nassau County --
L:  -- all around me.
R:  I'm in Long Island and Nassau and Suffolk County have done -- and New York City did it.  So, I know that they're --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- having[?] with the bars, they're having a lotta [inaudible] 'cause they feel they're losing money by people, you know, leaving the bar to smoke.
L:  I- -- right.
R:  And when --
L:  Right.  I -- I'm -- I'm real mixed on this.
R:  I am also.
L:  I'm a -- I'm an ex smoker myself and, um, I -- I mean, I -- I feel like that whoever owns the business should have the right to say whether there's smoking or not in the business and if they, you know, advertise it, I -- you know, I mean, if -- if I don't smoke and I see that it's a smoking establishment --
R:  That's true.  Absolutely true.
L:  -- I can choose not to go in now.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  I -- I mean, I -- I, kinda, hate it that an -- an individual that owns a business --
R:  Why have a smoking section?
L:  -- doesn't have the right to, you know -- to make those decisions.
R:  And, you know, the bars have smoking sections --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have a smoking section.  You don't have to sit by the smoke, you can --
L:  Right.
R:  -- walk away from the smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, people smoke in the street and if we --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pass them by and we inhale their smoke --
L:  And I mean [NOISE] --
R:  -- a- and we do just walk away.  You can walk away from it.  I mean, I am a reformed smoker --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- and I know how difficult it is --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to stop and I know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how em- -- how much people enjoy smoking when they're smoking. [PAUSE]
L:  Right.  And I mean, I -- I'm not -- I was careful when I smoked to try and not, you know, bother anyone else with it.  But I think it's just going to the extreme if these poor people [LAUGH] are going to have -- if they can't even go outside and smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- you know, like, I -- I mean, I understand in offices because the ma- majority of people do not smoke.  Majority of the people do not smoke and I understand that in an office and if it's confined --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you don't want --
L:  And I can too.
R:  But in a bar, that's my -- that's my social station and if I want to smoke, I smoke and I understand you don't wanna be around my smoke so then --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- go to another part of the restaurant or bar. [PAUSE] You know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, 'cause in New York it's --
L:  Yes.  That's -- that's the way I --
R:  -- the economy is not terrific and now you're stopping people from making a living --
L:  That's what I think also.
R:  -- because people aren't gonna go in if they can't smoke.  Or they're smoking regardless and the owners are not stopping them.
L:  Right.  Right.  And that's what they're doing [NOISE] -- right.  Oh, really?  'Cause see, in Austin, it's -- it's really bad.  I mean, in Austin and round, like -- I mean, there is no smoking in any -- on any public property, um, any restaurant, bar, um ... [LIPSMACK] same in Austin.  I mean, it's getting similar to -- I don't know if you're familiar with California, it's been banned out there for, gosh, oh, several years.
R:  Or any -- you know, I know that a lot of the bars in the Nassau and Suffolk County areas that people are smoking and if -- you know?  I don't know how strict they've been to enforce it and I don't know how really strict have been to enforce it but ...
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Yeah.  I -- I mean, I -- it doesn't --
R:  It bothe- -- I -- it don't bother me.
L:  It doesn't me. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, the smoke bothers me but I --
L:  Really, you know, to be around someone --
R:  -- ah, you know -- then -- 'cause I don't have to be there.
L:  -- that smokes.
R:  That really is what -- have to -- I don't have to be there. [PAUSE]
L:  Right.  And -- and that's what I've done where I'm -- and I have, I've been in positions before -- even as a smoker I'd get in places where I couldn't stand the smoke [LAUGH] and, you know, I moved on.  But -- and -- and that's -- I mean, to me, the business owner has the right to decide those things or should have.  And I mean, they're -- they're gonna e- e- encourage a- and -- the -- the, ah -- the clientele, you know, accordingly and if they offer smoking and business slacks off, well, you know, they can choose to change it.  But I just think that we're just interfering too much --
R:  Mm.  We're -- you know, I -- I -- you know, I know the commercials are gr- -- not great --
L:  -- in everyone's ability to make a choice --
R:  The commercials aren't great for the young children.
L:  -- here.
R:  You know, they're glamorous commercials and I know they don't like that and I understand that.  I understand that smoking is bad for you, that's why we've all stopped smoking.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, rights -- you have -- then you have the right to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but so do -- I guess they feel so does the person who doesn't smoke they don't have to [inaudible] it.
L:  Right.
R:  And they don't have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to be near us. [PAUSE]
L:  Right.  Well, I guess somebody that's never smoked before wouldn't understand but, you know, e- -- they -- one of the things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that -- that I think when they introduced this topic they said about, um, types of programs that are o- -- you know --
R:  Well, I -- I used the patch when I stopped.
L:  -- offered and -- and I think that's great --
R:  And I -- you know, I --
L:  -- that --
R:  -- did it so there was a [several inaudible words] --
L:  I -- I mean, when I quit I don't think that anybody was really offering much.
R:  -- with the patches that you had to wear and every week you change to another patch.  And I -- I know now, they have hypnosis and they have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all these things that just stop you from smoking.  But ...
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Yeah.  But, I mean, if they thought -- you know, they're offering something for everybody now, they wanna offer something for somebody that wants to quit smoking.  I have no problem with it because I know how difficult it is.  Um, a- -- m- -- you know, and if someone makes up their mind to do it --
R:  Well, it's hard -- it's hard to stop.  It definitely is hard to stop.
L:  -- um, maybe they need, you know --
R:  You know, it's a habit.
L:  -- some sort of --
R:  It's addictive.
L:  -- i- -- [LAUGH]
R:  And it's very hard to stop smoking.
L:  -- smoking -- ah, stop smoking classes or something --
R:  [several inaudible words].  But, I -- you know --
L:  -- or support groups.  I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know if I agree that, you know, in a bar with --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, where people are making their living if it's right to ban -- to ban it.  I don't know with that.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE]
R:  So that's [inaudible] for it. [PAUSE] Right.  That's what they will say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and there was --
L:  That's -- that's been one of the big, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Well, it's the secondhand smoke and they don't wanna breathe it, especially if they're not smokers.
L:  -- concerns here is some of the --
R:  And they don't wanna do it.
L:  -- bartenders --
R:  I mean, I understand they weren't wanting to breathe in someone else's --
L:  -- were saying that they were exposed to too much smoke.
R:  -- smoke.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Right. [PAUSE] Right.  And -- and here again, I think that there can be a s- -- you know, bars that are totally non smoking if they -- if they want to be if that's what the owner wants to have and those that are smoking.  And -- and that's just letting supply and demand.
R:  I will -- I'd hate to be -- own a restaurant or a bar --
L:  You know?
R:  -- or own a p- place where that is definitely an issue.
L:  If you got enough smokers that frequent the bars or enough non smokers, then you choose what your bar's going to be.  I don't know.  I'd hate to be a business owner and [NOISE] [PAUSE] -- yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I -- I would too because I -- I really think you have to make a choice and maybe the --
R:  I don't know.  I know that --
L:  -- you know, by government taking a s- -- a position --
R:  -- you know, I know -- I know in New York, a lotta the restaurants and bars are having a hard time.  You know?
L:  -- on it, it takes it --
R:  I mean, ah, you know --
L:  -- out of the hands of the business owner.
R:  -- there are -- you know, the beach resorts --
L:  But I don't know that that's really the best -- you know, best way to be.
R:  -- the Hamptons, you know all the beach resorts where people socialize and they stop smoking and drinking is what they do.  They still -- you know, that's what they do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- very hard not to -- to have to accept that, you know, they're not making money.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Right. [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's a social thing.  It's a social --
L:  Right.
R:  It definitely is a social ...
L:  Well, I know I have a lot -- a- actually --
R:  I- it's a way of being social --
L:  -- I have quite a few friends that are just more of a social smoker.
R:  -- especially in a bar and especially in restaurants.
L:  They only smoke when they drink.
R:  You know?
L:  You know?  They don't smoke any other time.
R:  I know.  I enjoyed smoking.  I enjoyed my cigarette after dinner.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I enjoyed my cigarette at a bar.
L:  And that's what it is.
R:  I did [NOISE] enjoy it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I didn't ...
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] Mhm.  Yep. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Right.  Me too.  Me too.  Well, I -- one thing that they did here in Austin was they -- I [SIGH] -- I don't know, it was stupid but that's Austin, what can I say?  Um, i- is that they didn't allow smoking in restaurants until after two in the afternoon.
R:  Well, I guess -- no.  But to have a smoking section and a non smoking section and then -- then they have it --
L:  And then after two in the afternoon, a restaurant could have a --
R:  -- it really doesn't work unless they have terrific ventilation.
L:  -- smoking section and a non smoking section.
R:  But at least, you don't get [inaudible] half of it.  That's really the bottom line.
L:  Now, that makes no sense --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatsoever. [LAUGH] [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Right.
L:  Well, and see they m- -- [NOISE] they required here that they have separate ventilation systems.  Like, you had to have completely different units for -- and that's what made it so cost prohibitive for s- -- a lot of the restaurants [NOISE] was that they couldn't afford to make those -- those changes, you know, in their ventilation systems.  But, ah, Austin's now trying to go totally, um, [LIPSMACK] non smoking anywhere, any time, bars and all.  They have been allowing ba- --
