R:  Diana.
L:  Hi, I'm Becky.
R:  Hi Becky.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How would you act?
R:  First of all, are you American?
L:  I am American.
R:  Okay.  'Cause I'm Canadian --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so we probably have a very different point of view.
L:  Right.  True.  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause we're -- we're less at risk --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I guess you think about it much more often than I do.
L:  I do.  I think about it an awful lot.  My husband's in the military; he's in Iraq right now.  So, --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- I -- I have a real good p- -- probably way different point of view than you do [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, 'cause I -- we don't -- I don't really think about it because there's never really happened here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I don't know how I would react in that --
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  I mean, if I was hm I mean I guess I've had ah we've had [MN] already had a lot of warnings and stuff, we live around a military base, so I don't get -- I don't get panicked, though.  It's not something I panic over.  I imagine if I was in a situation where there were -- it was right at you know right in front of it [LAUGH] I probably would, because if I had my children with me.
R:  Yeah, I think that's the difference is now that I have a child I probably would react differently than I probably would have --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- two years.
L:  More protective.
R:  Or three years ago.
L:  If it's just you, you know, there's not that -- that motherly nurturing instinct, you know, let's our protect our children but that -- that makes a difference.  I don't -- I mean, I don't think -- knowing there is some imminent thing, you know, maybe not right in your area might be a different story, but I mean after nine eleven I think everybody in America probably has a different point of -- ha -- you know, obviously has a different feeling and a different um flavor of what heroism really is.  And having seen it on television, I'm sure you of course you know, Canadians saw it just the same as we did, but [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, but it's not -- it's not the same for us because you're much more, as an American, at risk than we are as Canadians.
L:  Right.  Because nobody likes us [LAUGH].
R:  We're -- we're always in betw- we're always the neutral ones --
L:  Right.  And that's right.  You are --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because you're not a military power, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, you know, all the things that --
R:  Or an en- economical either.
L:  Er, right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's a big ah --
L:  It's economic.  It's our western values.  It's our financial status, exactly, that causes us to be at risk, along with our military and -- and what we believe governmentally, all puts us at risk.  And, yeah, I mean because we go into situations like we are now where we are in Iraq and have been in Saudi Arabia and all those different things, I think that's put us at a lot more risk, but, you know, I -- I f- I tend to think [SIGH] yeah, I know it's affected me personally [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  Obviously a lot and my husband being in [inaudible] and he's gone a lot, you know, two days after nine eleven he was gone because of that.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yeah.  So, I -- I --
R:  Overseas?
L:  Hm?
R:  Overseas?
L:  He went actually no, they um [LIPSMACK] two -- two days after that they went to um up around, around Washington DC area but that -- their -- their unit's air control, they -- they guard the airspace around places, so the, you know, the satellite and they do what -- they control planes, so they've gone around --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- like they guard the President's house in Texas, that kind of stuff.
R:  So, he's in the air force?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  That -- so, that's -- it affects me in that way and so I guess I think, you know, something imminent happened I -- I worry more about him than anybody, truthfully.  Because he's -- he's probably going to be the closest to anything ever --
R:  Yeah, and I guess afterwards he's, you know, more in it.
L:  He is now.
R:  But  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm telling you [LAUGH].
R:  A- a- exactly.  'Cause you're just not the common civilian, you're j- you're part of the Army.
L:  You're part of it and he's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- actually been quite -- in quite a few close calls here recently, so [SIGH] it -- it -- that -- from that point of view, I guess I think about it and now worry about it more, you know, as far as that goes.  I mean, ah -- for our family's sake I don't worry about it, but I worry about him.
R:  But I guess being placed in that kind of situation, you're probably more reassured also that -- as opposed to somebody who doesn't have the knowledge --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- of what the army does?
L:  Right.  Oh, he -- yeah, he has [LAUGH] yeah, I don't know, sometimes you don't want to know some of the stuff that --
R:  True.
L:  -- yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  Sometimes, less knowledge is --
L:  And there's a little too much at times.
R:  -- better.
L:  You know.  I handle it fine.  I'm sure some people don't, you know.  The -- the imminent danger part of it, you know [MN] because he's --
R:  How long have you been an army wife?
L:  Ah, twenty one years.
R:  Ooh, oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, so you've seen -- you've seen a lot come and go.
L:  Yes, ma'am, I have seen a lot come and go.  Seen a couple of wars and all that good stuff, but -- and they're all terrorist related, actually, you know, in a sense.
R:  Ah --
L:  But all the stuff that's happening has all, you know, been at least somewhat involved with it.  But it doesn't, you know, I -- in this area where we live it's very military and -- I live in Florida, so there's a lot of military --
R:  Oh, you're down in Florida?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh.
L:  The northwest part of Florida.
R:  I'm up north.  I'm in Montreal.
L:  You're way up north [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  With the snow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- is it -- is it colder in summer?
R:  In the summer?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, it's actually today's really hot and humid.
L:  Oh, it's probably just like it is here then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know how cool it gets in Montreal, I've not been to Montreal --
R:  See, we work with celsius --
L:  -- I've been to --
R:  -- you guys work with faren- -- I don't know what ah it's um, I guess it'd probably be about eighty --
L:  Okay.
R:  If not more.
L:  That -- it gets ni- a hundred here, you know.
R:  It's probably about that, because it's thirty, forty, depends on the humidex.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah -- I -- is it pretty dry in Cal- ah in California [LAUGH]?  In Florida?
L:  Florida.  No, no, no, no.  It's subtropical here.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.
L:  We have ninety percent humidity --
R:  I was there once, but it was in the winter --
L:  -- many days.  No, it's horribly humid here [LAUGH].  All the time.
R:  Are you guys ah hit by hurricanes yet?
L:  Yes.  Oh --
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  -- where we live gets -- yeah, we've had, since I've lived here we've had [SIGH] I don't know, direct hits too, and we just went through Bill with -- which was, we were on the right side of Bill and we've been through so many, I don't know --
R:  He's a recent one then, because I heard about him is it last week?
L:  Right.  Yeah, that one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was here.  And it -- it came across this side of -- of Flor- we always get hit where we are.  This p- we're right in the very center of the gulf, so we get hit by hurricanes a lot.
R:  Are you on the -- on the east side or the west side?
L:  Actually, central.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Central gulf.  Right there where they -- they come straight up at us, every time.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  For some reason [LAUGH].
R:  Huh.
L:  We get the bad weather here.  And it's rained and rained and rained and rained and rained, so we have a lot of bad weather.
R:  Oh, send it up here.  We need it.  We -- it hasn't rained here for like a week and a half.
L:  All it's done here for the last month.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yeah.  It rains constantly.  It's Florida, it's humid, it's hot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that's part of summer.  It's part of living here.  You just get used to it.  But I wonder if they like our terrorism [LAUGH]?
R:  Mm.
L:  Terrorism discussion.  G- [LAUGH] 
R:  It always turns to something else.
L:  I know.
R:  I don't know what they're looking for, though.
L:  Women don't know how to stay on the same subject anyway [LAUGH].
R:  Well, there's only so much that you can say on a certain subject --
L:  I know.  I know.  
R:  I think.
L:  I mean, I've -- I've d- been there, done that and that's over [LAUGH].  I prefer --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- I prefer talking about Florida [LAUGH].
R:  It's pro- it's a gloomy kind of subject.
L:  It is a gloomy subject.  And there's been several other they've offered us, I've passed up because they're just -- I wouldn't know what to say about 'em.
R:  I've only done one other one.
L:  Like equal opportunity, you know, the -- that one.  I don't remember, several of them, I've said, I wouldn't even know what to talk about.  You know.
R:  Unless it was a -- the last one I did was about food, which was good.
L:  I did pets.  I didn't get that one.  I must not have answered that one, or wouldn't have been home that one.  I might have been able to talk about that.  But --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm pregnant, so I think about food all day long [LAUGH].
R:  Oh yeah?  How many months?
L:  Hm?
R:  How many months are you pregnant?
L:  Um, about four and a half.
R:  Oh, and how'd you arrange that one? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, right before he left [LAUGH].  Not purposely [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, was -- it wasn't planned?
L:  No [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] Not exactly.
R:  Oh, it was g- how long has he been gone away?
L:  Oh, he's been gone since the beginning of April.  He'll be gone till the first of December.
R:  Till December?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, he'll be back for the ah the birth?
L:  That's basically it.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Try to wake him up.  Yeah, exactly.  That's kinda -- he'll kinda come in on the -- hopefully right on the tail end of it.  You know, right -- right when it's about to happen.
R:  Oh, I hope -- hopefully it won't be early.
L:  Yeah, well, that's exactly right, you know.  I'm -- I -- it could be.  You know, actually he might not be here.
R:  Do they get a special leave for ...?
L:  No, no, no, no.
R:  No?
L:  No.  No --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- several of the guys that he's --
R:  Get out.
L:  -- with his boss' wife had a baby right after he left, so he --
R:  Get out.
L:  -- hasn't even seen it yet.
R:  Oh, that's crappy.
L:  Oh, they don't care.  They don't care [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well, I've seen reports that they're not really family -- like, I -- well, I'd seen with -- because there was three ah spouses that were killed --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and now they're -- they're starting to rectify their marital ah -- because they weren't family geared --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they're taking into consideration when they come back from war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah because they become paranoid --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they're -- so now the army's just starting, you would figure that they would have done this a long time ago --
L:  Yeah, a long time ago.  Yeah, we had -- we had a um guy killed in the unit and --
R:  Well, it must be difficult because you're in a killing situation and to come back home and then have to st- stop thinking that way.
L:  That's -- that is --
R:  I mean.
L:  -- it was real hard when my husband came back from the Gulf War, it was like -- they're always on hyper alert, you know, being attacked by scuds and all that stuff and he was just like, he had a hard time sleeping for a while because they were so used to sleeping light and waking up at night --
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  -- and being woken up by alarms and everything, so he had a hard time sleeping.  He said, "It's so quiet, I -- I can't sleep" [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- and he was living by an airbase, no less.  I mean, we're living where airplanes were landing right next to him --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so --
R:  But it's -- still, it's not the same.  I mean you'd have to -- I mean I'm sure they're hearing bombs and stuff like that --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- and you have to sleep with one eye open.
L:  He just doesn't know how -- he has a hard time gearing down when he gets back, but he does.  He -- he works [inaudible] and he's been in long enough that he can handle it.  It's the young guys have a problem --
R:  But --
L:  -- you know, like your -- your, you know, either newly in or have never done it, he's been everywhere and been in all kinds of situations.
R:  But, ah, hats off to them.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  It's -- it's a tough, tough life.
R:  Er, just to -- to be able to split your personality
