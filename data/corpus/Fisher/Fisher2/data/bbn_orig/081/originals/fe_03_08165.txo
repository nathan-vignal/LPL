L:  Hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Stephanie and I'm from California.
R:  Hi, I'm Jennifer and I'm from Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about the -- how has the divorce rate affected the way we see marriage, basically?
R:  Mhm.  Well, this is the first time I've ever done this, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Okay.  But --
L:  You just talk.  That's it.  You just talk --
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  Say your views on it, basically and --
R:  Um --
L:  That's about it.
R:  Divorce.  Divorce, I think it does affect how people think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and how people act because most of the kids in my school, their p- if their parents are divorced, they're the ones that are mostly depressed or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- are unhappy, in my opinion.
L:  Right.
R:  Or they are the ones that are mostly rude or go to drugs and alcohol first.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My thing is that I think a lot of um married couples think that that's the easy way out of their problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I know people who've gotten divorced --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and I think it's a choice that you make, but a lot of the time when people get divorced they don't realize how it affects everybody else in their family.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  And I think that it's taken very lightly.  I just think it's, you know, the easy way out.
R:  Yeah.  Well, see, I'm Indian --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we're Christians --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, we have very high morals --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and there's not many Indian Christians that you know that get divorced --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not even Indians that are Hindus or Muslims, or anything like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because we have very, very, very high morals.
L:  Right.
R:  And my mom and dad and mostly all my aunts and uncles and almost every Indian older couple that I know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- has had arranged marriages.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Arranged marriages, which means they don't know each other, you know --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- nothing about -- all they knew, like, all they know about each other was like it's very common in India, so I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not anything like the kids rebel against because --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- it's been a tradition, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, all they knew is what they look like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they didn't know anything else.  They got married and they're living a happy life, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  There's not, like so, I mean, in America it's usually love marriages --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and for some reason there's more divorce over here than there is in India.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So, I mean, I think that's very awkward.
L:  It is awkward.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Especially, I think, I mean my parents have been married like thirty five years --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and back when they got married it was not common for divorce --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and they stuck together through thick and thin.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been married for ten years --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and it's not the easiest thing in the world --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you stick -- you make a commitment and you stick --
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  I just think, you know, I'm a Christian as well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my values are divorce is not an option --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you work things out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you get counselling, you get help --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you do what you can to make sure everything works.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially when you have children and, you know, it just involves so much.
R:  Yeah, it does.  Because if my parents ever got divorced, I don't know what I would do.  Like, honestly, I -- I know I wouldn't get into drugs or anything like that, but I would be tempted to.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  I'm telling you honestly.
L:  It's -- it's -- it's a huge --
R:  You know?
L:  -- it's a huge blow to anybody, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what a lot of kids do is that they rebel or they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go to other things to meet that need because their parents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are so wrapped up in their divorce --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they can't meet their needs.
R:  I think divorce is selfish also.
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  I think divorce is very selfish.
L:  I completely agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it is one of the most selfish things around.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I said, it's that people take it as the easy way out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Oh, I'm fighting too much and I just want out" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and instead of, you know, people are put together for a reason.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Back in biblical days --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there were arranged marriages also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it -- you know, there wasn't divorce and things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it was very --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- rare if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if there was a divorce.
R:  Mhm.  Like in Indian community it's also very rare.  It's just if things do not work out at all and I mean, not everyone gets along --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I mean just in America I think the rate is very high --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- almost everyone I know is divorced.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Yeah, I know a lot of people -- among my friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we've all been married about the same time, but we've all been through the hard stuff as friends --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- together --
R:  That's good.
L:  So, we've been able to support each other and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and help each other and --
R:  And don't you have -- do you have --
L:  -- have some accountability --
R:  -- your parents with you, helping you out?
L:  Um, not really.
R:  Oh.
L:  Their views on marriage are really different.  All -- all of my um family members --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have been divorced, except for my parents.
R:  Oh.
L:  And except for me.  I've never been divorced.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's really good [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  But --
R:  That's really good.
L:  -- in a sense, I'm the only one who is a Christian in my family as well.
R:  Oh, what is everyone else?
L:  Um, nothing [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, so like atheist?
L:  Well, not really atheist.  I mean, my brother claims to be a Catholic, but doesn't really follow --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what he's taught --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I understand what you're saying.
L:  But, yeah, it's just the different morals that people have and the different way they see things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Things in marriage just has a lot to do with it.
R:  Yeah.  How'd you meet your husband?
L:  Um, I met him in high school.
R:  Wow.
L:  We hated each other.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And then we got together --
R:  Can you hold on?
L:  -- a couple of years later.
R:  Can you hold on one second?
L:  Sure.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Sorry [LAUGH].
L:  But yeah, we did not like each other and a couple of years later we kind of met again and then started dating.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah, it's -- it's kind of odd --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people always laugh when I say we didn't like each other [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when we met.
R:  I think that's cute.
L:  But, ah, yeah and it's, you know, we've had our share of ups and downs and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we don't speak divorce into our marriage, you know --
R:  That's good.
L:  So it's -- it's been one of those things where, you know, we've seen -- his parents went through and it really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- affected his family and stuff, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- scary.
R:  -- one that hasn't been affected by divorce.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.  Can you hold on one more second?
L:  Sure.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm so sorry [LAUGH].
L:  That's okay.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  I -- I think it's just too many people view it as -- as just the easy way.
R:  Yeah.  Because it's been so popular now that, you know, it doesn't seem like it's wrong anymore.
L:  Right.  And it's easier --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get divorced than it is to get married.
R:  Yeah, it is [LAUGH].
L:  It's -- it's sad, I know too many --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people who have gone through it and have regretted it.
R:  Yeah.  Because, I mean, to -- no one ever said married life is easy.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's no handbook that says this is --
R:  No.
L:  -- going to be easy and, you know --
R:  Because that's committing your life to, you know, another person right there and you're going to be living with them for the rest of your lives and you're going to be --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- with them and you made that commitment.  And once you made that commitment --
L:  Okay Page.
R:  -- I don't think --
L:  Sorry, my daughter's calling for me.
R:  It's okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you have children?
L:  Yeah.  I have two.
R:  Oh, that's cute.
L:  Um, I just -- I know that it's -- it just would never be an option for me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and for most of my friends see things -- see it the same way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that it's not an option.
R:  Like s- 
L:  You just --
R:  I really respect you for that.  So [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] It's not worth it, to me.  It's not worth --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to put my kids through or anything like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Can you call me when you're done okay, sweet pea? [NOISE] Sorry.
R:  It's okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  Potty training, it's oh so fun.
R:  Oh.  How old is she?
L:  Three.
R:  Three?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Especially at that age, if something like that happened --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- that would really affect them.
L:  Well, my husband works out of town a lot and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they hate it.  They hate that he's gone and they cry and all that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's like, I couldn't ever imagine being divorced and them seeing him hardly at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just don't think that's fair to them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just one of those things you just -- it depends on your morals and the way you view things.  A lot of people view it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as oh, well, they're just not meeting my need and they have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unrealistic expectations on each other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you can't really go into a marriage with that -- even though we all do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everybody thinks it's going to be so great and wonderful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Are you all done? [NOISE] Okay, call me when you're done.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  But um [LIPSMACK] yeah, it's -- it's the way you go into it and the way you view it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I've never been through it, so I'm going to wait for that day --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and marri- divorce is never going to cross my mind.
L:  That's good.  That's good.
R:  Because I'm going to wait, so.
L:  That's a good way of going into marriage, that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even if I -- my husband and I went through a um marriage class and it talked about like the power of the spoken word and how your words, once they leave your mouth, you can never take 'em back --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- and so they say, "Don't ever speak divorce into your marriage because you can't take that back".
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  So, yeah, it's -- it's hard.
R:  Yeah, because what you say, even if you don't mean, it -- it's still in the back of the other person's head.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's still there.  Even if they don't --
L:  And you can't --
R:  -- say anything.
L:  -- you can't take it back, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  It's not something that you can -- you could do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's unfortunate, because so many people get hurt that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But yeah, the -- as far as I think the way America views divorce is it's just the easy route and they don't seem -- a lot of Americans don't seem to really
