L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Joan.  I'm Joan Hawkins.
R:  Hi, I'm Denora.  And I'm --
L:  Who?
R:  Denora.
L:  Denora.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Where do you live?
R:  I'm from the Bronx, New York City.
L:  Bronx.  Well, I live in upstate New York [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Not too far.
L:  Near Syracuse.
R:  Oh, Syracuse.  That's far, yeah.
L:  Near Syracuse.  Yeah.  So, ah censorship.  I wasn't quite sure what that meant when I heard it, um, had something to do with um cer- alls I got out of it was um to -- whether we think um certain books should be forbidden in the public schools?
R:  Right.
L:  Is that what you heard?
R:  That's what I heard.
L:  B- --
R:  The question is, should certain books, yeah [inaudible] in public schools.
L:  Right.  The first thing I heard was about censorship, isn't that what she said?
R:  She said censorship, yes.
L:  I wasn't sure at first, I --
R:  Which means restrictions and forb- forbiddens and if certain books should be forbidden, I guess, from public schools.
L:  Right.  Well, I thought maybe it had something to do with some kind of politics and I thought, "Oh, geeze.  I don't know, I'm not into this stuff, you know" --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But um, [MN] I don't know if I have enough to say for ten minutes, um what's your thoughts?
R:  Well, I have a -- um, I have a school age unit, ah a school age son at home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who's going to s- ah public school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and there is some material that he does bring home that I don't um approve of.
L:  And what rights do you have?  Do you have any?
R:  I what -- what?
L:  Do you have any rights?  Do you have any say?
R:  Well, yes.  I believe you could approach the teacher and um and tell them how you feel about the material --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they should be able to choose another book to write a book report on, let's say.
L:  Right.
R:  Because I know he brings some stuff um you know that's against what we believe like, um, you know, wh- white witchcraft stuff, you know, those h- Harry Potter books --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and all that.  That's the rave now, so he's bringing, you know, ho- those home and actually I haven't read them and but I also tell him, you know, how our household feels about that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because I don't want to shun him either from, you know, I don't want him to ah feel different from his other classmates or whatever, 'cause everybody's reading them, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I do think that parents should have, you know, um, a say in what their kids bring home.
L:  Well, there seems to be um from time to time in the papers you'll see it become quite an issue in certain areas or schools, or whatever.  I'm not [MN] um obviously probably quite a bit older than you, I'm a grandma --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and ah I've ah had three children and at the time when I had um -- my oldest being forty, my youngest thirty -- um, I don't even think personally, as with many things, that was even a consideration back then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't think I ever thou- -- I'm not saying maybe that there wasn't something, maybe I should have, but I just don't remember --
R:  Right.
L:  -- having the issue or it being the issue --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now, I have grandchildren.  Two of my three children home school, so they get to choose --
R:  So, they don't have --
L:  -- their curriculum.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, the other doesn't.  And I'm not sure um ah -- they have the same beliefs as the other two, but home schooling wouldn't work for them ah for a lot of personal reasons and I don't know how um that will be incorporated in that one is just in the lower grades and the other hasn't started school yet --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um [MN] so I'm not sure how w- what they will do if they were to bring home a book like you just spoke about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um --
R:  But if they object to it, I'm pretty sure they could go to their teacher and say, "Listen ..." [SIGH] like okay my son isn't allowed to celebrate Halloween, so he always tells his teachers, you know, "I'm not allowed to celebrate Halloween" and everybody's okay with that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, everybody's okay with that.  He's okay with that, um, and when asked, you know, "Why don't you believe in Halloween?" he'll tell them why.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, because for religious reasons, or whatever, we don't --
L:  Well, you know, when my kids went -- I guess [SIGH] Halloween has always been Halloween but probably I was younger, didn't have my thoughts all on straight or whatever, but I didn't have all the thoughts with it that I do now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as a grown woman in her sixties --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as a grown -- I was grown then, obviously, I had children, but, you know, as a more mature woman and seeing what -- see what our country's gone through and our -- it and the generations what's passed through and everything, and out of my three children, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think any of them really are excited over the holiday and ah I know two of them actually, you know, the home schoolers don't um do much of anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- occasionally there's something going on one time at the library and she puts some little thing on and they didn't really -- it wasn't a fuss thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it wasn't a real big emphasis.  So, she does a little.  Whereas the public school one, yeah, you know, there in with that whole thing, yet I don't really feel they do care about it.  Yeah, b- and so we do have different issues and I -- we would like to think that the schools, here again it's the same as God and country and all that and -- and what they're taking out of the schools and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the -- there's things that can't be in there that you -- because of this reason and "Oh, God forbid, this can't be on the wall" or "This can't be", so I don't know how children that are in public schools will fare through the years being, as you said, different --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on certain ah issues as in books, holidays, ah religious things, um, I don't know, I --
R:  Yeah, it -- they have a tough -- a tough time because over here in the city --
L:  Here it's terrible.
R:  Yeah.  Over here in the city, we're very mixed.  I mean, we have everything here.  You know, all religions, all nationalities, all beliefs, all cultures --
L:  You have quite a -- right.  You have quite a bit more --
R:  -- there's a melting pot.  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It is a melting pot.  We have everything.  So, our son is exposed to everything and everyone.
L:  Right.
R:  So, but there's things that totally go against what we believe, so that's what, you know, like everything he brings in, I want to see what he's bringing in, what they're teaching him in the school, and I tell him how I feel about certain material.  You know.
L:  Now, are you a one parent, or do you --
R:  I'm a one parent, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm a one parent, one child.
L:  One child.  Now --
R:  Which is pretty good.  It's a pretty good ratio.
L:  How -- [LAUGH] Well, good.
R:  He only has -- he has [LAUGH] --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- he has just me telling him, you know, which is excellent, he doesn't have a two sided opinion or anything --
L:  Right.  That's why I asked.
R:  But actually I think --
L:  I wondered if you --
R:  -- that helps -- yeah.
L:  -- had another opinion.
R:  Oh no.  I one -- I -- I really think that that really is a blessing, you know, that it's actually one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on one.  It's hard financially and everything, but in that aspect, it's excellent because he only has my opinion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's good.  So um --
L:  Now, are you of what descent?
R:  I'm hispanic from Puerto Rico.
L:  I would have said Spanish, something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hispanic from Puerto Rico.  Born and raised here, though, so --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how old is your son?
R:  My son is eleven.
L:  Oh, he's eleven now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ah how's he doing, pretty good?
R:  He's doing excellent --
L:  Good.
R:  -- he's done excellent, yeah, he's -- he's a kid.
L:  Well, there's others of his nationality in the school system too, right?
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  But it's really mixed, though.  I mean, I can't say that it's more --
L:  Really multi racial.
R:  -- r- rather multi racial.  Multi racial and multi um, you know, um, culture, multi um religion --
L:  Well, you haven't seen it being a -- it -- well, he's in ah, fifth, sixth, grade?
R:  He's in -- yeah, he's going to sixth grade now.
L:  He -- you haven't seen it as a big issue as you do approach, ah have you had to be approaching many things yet that --
R:  [SIGH] No --
L:  -- you --
R:  -- I haven't, no.  I haven't.  I haven't.
L:  So, that's a blessing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That you haven't had to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go against the grain [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  No, no, no.  I'm pretty sure, I mean I'm an educated person and I'm pretty sure if I go to the teacher and speak to them clearly and, you know, state my opinion in a professional manner, in a respectful manner that they would, you know, respect what I feel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if it's done correctly.  Everything c- done correctly is effective.  That's the way I feel.
L:  I guess I just don't -- y- you know, what makes the papers are the ones where there's contention and it goes to court and what's going to happen and all -- you know, you probably are aware that some issues get quite big [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.  Oh, yeah.
L:  And they make national news if nothing else, you know --
R:  Exactly.  Well, somebody made a big deal about it, somebody, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- really made a big deal about it and [SIGH] that's how it got in the paper, you know, or somebody ah refused to listen to someone else's opinion, um, or violated someone's rights, you know, to have an opinion, that's when I think it really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- makes the papers --
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  It's like your opinion doesn't mean anything to me, this is what we do here and if you don't like it, that's too bad --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- type of thing and that's when it gets to a, you know, that's when it gets out of hand.
L:  Right.  I -- I think so much has been taken away from the schools, though.
R:  E- a lot -- a lot --
L:  Liberties.
R:  -- has been.  The wholesomeness of -- of the school system as a whole, the wholesomeness of it all --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is gone.
L:  You can understand why parents that are able for a whole bunch of reasons, and it's not always religious, um do home schooling --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my daughter used to think that was it and yet she has um different friends or in her home school groups and she knows that um some of the beliefs aren't the same but um religious wi- you know, what their belief faith system is, but they definitely have some educational concerns --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um and what their children face, but then there are other concerns that the kids won't be exposed to what they need so that when they are older, they'll be able to work with their peers --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so there's that --
R:  Despite the differences and d- and not being prejudiced against what other people feel, you know, and -- and work with each other's differences --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and don't judge because of other people's differences, that's why I think it's necessary for them to be exposed to certain things, that's why I don't tell him, "Okay, don't read it" but I tell him, "Read it, but ..." and I give him, you know, conditions, you know, "Don't start believing in that, whatever.  We don't believe in that" you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- it's unacceptable here, but if you have to do a book report on it, read it, remember it's fiction, you know, it's all not true --
L:  E- -- Right.
R:  -- and um -- and I think that -- that works, though.  The parent really has to be involved.
L:  Do you have a -- a -- a some other support systems, family --
R:  Um, none.  None.  None.  And it's -- and it's--
L:  Not here?  Not -- you're just yourself and what friends you have?
R:  It's just and him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The friends that I have here and there.
L:  Do you work?
R:  Yeah.  I work full time.  Go to school full time.
L:  Work and go to school full time?
R:  Yeah.
L:  God bless you!
R:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  So, um, you know, I guess the parent just has to be involved, you know, the parent has to be involved and have a --
L:  Yeah.  And that's a big word, involvement, I think too is because, you know, [SIGH] I -- I -- I see my ah the couple with their child in public school, and they both work and, you know, e- I don't know if they're always aware and um they're not quite near me now, it's about fifty minutes, but I get concerned because I had more time and I can see and hear things of when I do see them and I
