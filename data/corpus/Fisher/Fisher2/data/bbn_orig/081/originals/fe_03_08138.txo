R:  Hi, I am Erica from New York City.
L:  Hi, I'm Stephanie and I live in Nebraska.
R:  Okay.  So, what do you think?  How would you react? [LAUGH]
L:  That's [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's interesting since --
R:  It's a loaded question.
L:  -- you live in New York City.
R:  Yes [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I better practise [inaudible] --
L:  I just -- well, the -- what I -- would we remain calm, or panic?  I think I'd panic.  It depends.
R:  Depends.  What kind -- what kind of [inaudible] if you had been on the hundred and tenth floor in fire, who -- who would not panic?
L:  I know.  I mean --
R:  Who -- how could you not panic?
L:  That's the thing is -- it all kind of depends, because if I'm in Nebraska and something happened some place else, probably I'm going to be calm, um, but if you're right there, yeah, you have to panic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kind of a stupid question [LAUGH].
R:  It is.  I mean, you know, that's all you hear for the past two years.  That's all you hear.
L:  Right.
R:  What to eat, you can't drink the water, you have to bottled water, you don't know what's happened to the food supply.
L:  Right.
R:  And ah also for today they may have ah you know, the sort of expect the terrorist attacks, there are more cops on the streets, not as many as last year --
L:  Really?
R:  I'm surprised they have connected us tonight.  I mean the amazing fireworks just started.
L:  Well, yeah, see I was wondering because where I am it's only eight fifteen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so it's not dark yet and we still have a couple of hours, but I was thinking, "Well, who's gonna [LAUGH]" --
R:  Who is going -- I really did not expect them to contact us tonight.
L:  No, I didn't either.
R:  If it hadn't been so extremely hot and humid, I would not be so tired. I would have gone and -- and see these firework.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I was out and just came home maybe two hours ago.
L:  It's really hot here, too.
R:  Over there too?  Is it humid?
L:  It's, yeah, it's like a hundred degrees --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, gosh --
L:  -- today and it was just --
R:  -- for this time of year [LAUGH].
L:  -- oh, I'm so happy I have air conditioning.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And we went out, you know, from time to time, but nobody's outside.  It's just, oh, it's a bad day [LAUGH].
R:  Now, oh, everybody does, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, of course people don't have to [inaudible] but in the city, the city was crowded.  I went to -- to Central Park and the park was even more crowded.
L:  [SIGH] Where do they do the fireworks there?
R:  It's ah it's in Brooklyn, but you can see it from the waterfront, from the east side the best ah east side of Manhattan.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  And it's coming from ah I think that's where it's from, Brooklyn.  And it's not only firework, but there's a show.  They are showing the show on TV.  Dancing and signing and so on.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, this is what we have to talk about.  How, how would you react?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, you get all these things from the management office of the apartment and from the Manhattan Borough President, like what to -- we are being to ha- always have ah flashlight, just in case there's a power failure, you can see to walk down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the battery operated radio, extra medication --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and some kind of a medi- some ki- I don't know what it's called, I forgot the name.  You should have on hand just in case there's a bio- some kind of an attack by biol- biological terror.  You have to drink that stuff and it makes you throw up.
L:  Wow.
R:  You have to keep that on hand.
L:  Oh.  See, we don't hear --
R:  And so, I mean --
L:  -- any of that out here.  I mean, we just don't --
R:  E- well, we have been the number one target.
L:  Yeah.  That's one of the reasons why --
R:  And then so many supplies of water and these supplies of water and food --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- plus they always expect before the -- for ah during the holy Muslim days, you h- they expected the banking system to go down, then you cannot use your credit card or debit card, you can't even buy food, so you have to carry so much cash on you --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which nobody likes to do again because what if you get robbed?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so you have [several inaudible words] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so you can buy food [LAUGH].  It's unbelievable.  But you get used to that, too, you know, we are getting used to it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What can you do?
L:  Yeah.  And w- we're just -- we're -- I'm originally from the east coast and we were thinking about moving back and I said, "You know, we're right in --"
R:  Not now, this is not a good time.
L:  "-- in the middle of the country, nobody's going to come here, I mean --"
R:  Hopefully, yeah.
L:  So, yeah.  We don't even hear anything anymore, at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which I --
R:  But it's less -- there is less to ah than until the war, yes.
L:  Right.
R:  That nu- that color used to be red, or orange, the high terror alert.
L:  It's funny because ah we were in Hawaii on September eleventh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- getting married.  Not September eleventh, but September tenth --
R:  You got married then?
L:  -- and -- yeah.
R:  Oh my god.
L:  So, we didn't even know, and I was glad that we didn't know, because I don't know how we would have reacted.  We didn't know until the day after, um --
R:  What do you mean, you didn't see the T- on TV?
L:  No, we were on our honeymoon.  We were -- there weren't -- we were out kayaking and things.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, and then --
R:  Oh, my god.  You must be the only person on earth [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.
R:  Who did not know it.
L:  Well, we noticed that there's -- we thought, "There's something wrong" because the people in Hawaii were really afraid since they remember Pearl Harbor --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they were so isolated from the mainland and they get all s- supplies from the mainland and they thought it would just be this terrible thing, so they kind of closed everything down and we saw that and so we just asked somebody and he said, "You don't know?" and then he showed us the newspapers.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  And then, but it had already happened.  So, we weren't afraid, because we already knew that it had happened and it was over.  And all we had to do was think of a way to get off the island, but our plane went perfectly fine and it was very safe and then we came back home and it --
R:  How many days after did you come home?  Did you --
L:  It was five days.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, we were lucky the planes had already started again and --
R:  Yes, because for a day or two no planes were allowed.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  So, we were -- I think we were very lucky.  Because I asked people what had happened when they got here and everybody was watching it as it happened on TV and they had no idea what was going to happen next.  And so people -- even people here were panicking when they were watching and I thought, you know, "We never -- we never had that because we didn't experience it".
R:  People were panicking in Hawaii?
L:  Yes.
R:  Really.
L:  The gas, they all -- the --
R:  The g- yeah, well of course everybody was shocked beyond belief, but --
L:  Yeah.  They were just afraid because they were so far away from the mainland that they were going to be the next to be attacked.
R:  Really?
L:  And, yeah, they had civil defence --
R:  You should be here, then you have something to worry about [LAUGH].
L:  I know [LAUGH].  They had these speakers that they put up after World War Two and they're all over the place on the streets and everything and it's the civil defence and so --
R:  It's still up, those -- the speakers?
L:  Yeah.  So, they -- the Governor would come on and he would give these messages on the speakers and say that everything was okay and that we shouldn't, you know, hoard gasoline and --
R:  As if he knew, huh?
L:  -- yes.
R:  How would he know?
L:  Like, "What's he talking about?" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was very strange [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's weird.
R:  He looked in a crystal ball [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Now, I congratulate you, that you had the nerve to sit on an airplane, even today I hesitate --
L:  It was very safe.
R:  -- five days after?
L:  It was very safe.  And we had an air marshal --
R:  How do you know it w- how do you know it was going to be safe?
L:  I -- I think that was probably the safest time that you could get because they were so stringent about security and now I don't know, you know, it may have gotten relaxed, but they searched every suitcase and every bag --
R:  Oh, really?  Oh, my god.
L:  -- and they had the military out there --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  It was very nice.  Those were nice flights.  And we thought, you know, "Boy, if we're gonna fly at any time, this is probably the way to go" and it was the only way to get home, so we had to.
R:  Well, you had to, yeah.  You had no choice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how would you be panic, I have no idea?  I probably would, if it was -- if they -- you know, if I -- something happened in my building, I thought a big building, forty stories high and you couldn't get out, of course you'd panic.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, you would have no idea what you'd do.
R:  I think I would.  I have no idea.
L:  I'm -- I'm sure that I would.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At -- at least, I mean, that has to be your initial reaction.  And then maybe you'll calm down when you're thinking what to do, but --
R:  But now that we are prepared for it, we would not panic as much as those poor people on that day.
L:  I know.
R:  I remember when I saw people who have had horrible burns --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when they release -- were released from the hospital.  I remember that chubby guy, the Indian guy, he had no idea why or what happened, you know?
L:  Oh.
R:  He just knew er he was burnt, he had to walk down eighty flights.  And he had no -- he didn't know what happened at the time.
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  Then the radio in the hospital as he was watching the news, that's how he found out what happened to him.
L:  Wow.
R:  He -- he could not know.  Nobody knew.  And the first time people thought it was an accident, they told everybody in the second building to go back to their offices.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's just bad.  That's very, very -- it's just such a terrible situation.
R:  But to pick such a topic ah for the fourth of July, I -- I should complain about this.
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] This is what we have to discuss [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's my last call.  It's the third one, so I think --
R:  Mine too, yes.
L:  -- I'm done [LAUGH] which is nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I know --
R:  Maybe they like our answers, so they give us more [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] And it's a holiday.  I thought, "Who's calling me?" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I'm surprised.  And it's a stupid topic, really.  The second topic was very good.  I enjoy that one.  But --
L:  Oh, I had a professional sports on TV topic
