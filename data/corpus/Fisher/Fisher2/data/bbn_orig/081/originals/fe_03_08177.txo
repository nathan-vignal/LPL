R:  He-
L:  Hi, this is Connie from Florida.
R:  Hi, I'm Lesley from ah Southern California.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Great.
R:  How's the weather out there?
L:  [LAUGH] It's pretty nice.
R:  It's pretty hot here.
L:  Is it?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's in the nineties --
L:  It's in the nineties. Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But sub tropical so --
R:  Yeah.  It's good.
L:  Any way.  So, hey, what a -- what topic.  I've been through that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, have you?
L:  Yes.
R:  I haven't.  Um, --
L:  Oh.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Ah, fifty six.
R:  Okay, I'm fifty one, fifty two.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  So.  Did it change your views?  Ah, going through a divorce?
L:  [SIGH] Well, on some things um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] it's hard to say, because, you know, just from a personal point if view, you just, you know, you don't want to go through it all again, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, but how -- what are we supposed to talk about, how it changes your attitudes on what?
R:  On the -- you know they said family values and then they said divorce and ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how do -- how divorce changes your attitudes towards family values or it was --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- really --
L:  Well -- [LAUGH] --
R:  -- not phrased very well.
L:  It was vague [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, well, I think that with a lot of the divorces that people don't -- their family values go down because they don't value the institution of marriage as a valid thing.  They get married, they get divorced on and on and on and it just becomes a big circle.
R:  I think so too that because divorce is so prevalent that the value of maybe we do need to stick it out I think that they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- take the ah the view that you know, in some cases, you know, in some cases, you know, it's in the person's best interests to get out of that relationship for, you know, many reasons --
L:  Of course, mhm.
R:  -- but sometimes I think especially the younger people, oh, well, we're not getting along today, um, and I want my freedom, will, you know, oh, we'll just get a divorce and you know, this isn't any fun anymore, we'll just get a divorce.
L:  Yes.  I think you're right, I don't think they take it seriously at all.
R:  No, I don't either.
L:  You know, I mean it -- in our day you didn't get a divorce.
R:  No.
L:  You know, I mean it was like, ooh.
R:  There were a lot of taboos and stigma --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- attached to being especially a divorced woman.
L:  Yeah.  I think so too.
R:  But --
L:  And then when you went to parties with friends, they're all like, "Oh, are they after my husband or something?" --
R:  Exactly --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like -- like I'd want your husband [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, right, I just got rid of one.  Why would I want another one?  Oh.
R:  I've been there, done that.
L:  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I mean, I think [SIGH] I don't know, I think in ethnic families too it changes the values --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I just see it you know coming down the pipe that as marriage leads to divorce that other things happen too and then everything you know falls apart.
R:  Right.
L:  The whole structure of the country [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, I really feel like it's leading to our downfall and it's -- it's a shame but --
R:  Oh, totally.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um, so many times people I think in some groups, well, some b- they -- the government will take care of us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they grow up because of the divorce, you know, being on welfare with different family values ah than I have because I think the man is important, I think the woman is important in a re- in a family.  They both give different --
L:  Yeah, they do bring values.  Different --
R:  Different things to the ah the children and so the children grow up, you know, in some instances thinking, "Hey, the man isn't necessary" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  That's true.
R:  If that's the -- if that's the case, let's just do away with all boy babies [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Well --
R:  Let's get a good thing of sperm going and --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  That's true.
R:  -- we don't [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  The Amazon women take over.
R:  Yeah.  Really.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Um, I don't know.  I don't think like young kids now are getting into relationships so early, like seventh grade and eighth grade and I don't see how they can have much in the way of values at that point.
R:  No.  No, not at all.  Ah --
L:  So, I think it's even worse when they see their parents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get divorced and then they -- the -- they don't think anything of it.
R:  No.  Or --
L:  It's like --
R:  -- you know, this is my daddy's third wife and this is my mom's fourth husband and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like, you know, a new pair of shoes or flavor of the week.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's scary too, isn't it?
R:  It really is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because then they grow up thinking it's just a -- a temporary situation.
L:  Yeah.  And it becomes normal to them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's what scares me.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Because you see it coming.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, definitely.
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  How old were you when you got married?
L:  Twenty one.
R:  So was I.
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  And now I hear somebody's twenty one they're getting married, I'd be, "Are you out of your mind?" --
L:  Yeah, I know.  Gosh, I was married twenty two years, the first time.
R:  Mhm.  That's a long time.
L:  And ah --
R:  That is a long time.
L:  I don't think it's, you know, changed my values at all.  The divorce or anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] it did make you f- realize that the family is important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, in -- in a one -- in a group, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it just --
R:  Did you have children?
L:  Just one --
R:  Or w-- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Was he or she older at the time?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Out of the house.
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
L:  Kind of stuck with it for a while.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But ah you know, he's just thirty two and he's just getting married for the first time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I don't think it really changed his values, but he just figured he'd probably never get married and settle down and have kids and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't know -- changed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- changed his mind.  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Took a while, so I don't know if that, you know, that worked into his values or not, you know.
R:  Well, probably because he was raised in an intact home where, you know, you and your husband were both there, that he probably he has the ideal that, you know, this is going to be forever, hopefully --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and --
L:  Well, I mean I grew up with family from like TV family, you know, mom, dad --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- kids, cousins, everybody, you know, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's just big family and my son doesn't know half of them, you know what I mean it's all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  It's changing.
R:  My --
L:  One generation changes.
R:  My son, one time -- he's in college -- we were talking about when I was growing up, he goes, "You grew up during the wonder years, mom" [LAUGH].
L:  Oh the wonder years, wow [LAUGH].  Gee, we had telephone and TV --
R:  And I --
L:  -- and ah [LAUGH] a few things like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah.  Is that what he meant?  All the new --
R:  Well, you know that show, the Wonder Years, that was on TV?
L:  I don't really remember it.
R:  Oh, let's see.  It was um I forget the ki- it was to- told from the kid's point of view and he was like in seventh grade when it started out --
L:  Oh, that would have gone, yeah, that -- that builds family values.
R:  And um he had an older sister and a younger brother and ah he was going through junior high and the Vietnam war was just starting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, it's like his point of view and, you know, riding his bike to school and things like that and so he said, "You know, things were so different for you, mom" and I said, "Yeah, they were" and my daughter's fifteen and, you know, she -- she -- right now she's in an all girls school and very, very protected and I can't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I think of um you know, she might have to walk home from the city park and I'm thinking, "Well, yes it's okay for her to walk home" I'm thinking, "Well, when I was that age, I was doing all these things and" [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean --
R:  But now I'm thinking, "Is it safe for her to walk home?" and we live in a very small town and --
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  -- like volunteer fire department, no stop lights in the town [LAUGH] so it's --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- it's real small yeah.
L:  Sounds like where I grew up [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  It's [inaudible] like a -- a blurp in time [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Exac- no, it was Leave it to Beaver land.
R:  Yes.  Exactly.
L:  That was exactly how it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ah --
R:  And, you know, she comes home from school and I'm here and we sit down at dinner with like she and my husband -- my son's older and he's living in London right now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but we eat dinner with our -- all of us together and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's really kind of strange [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to a lot of people.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, because everybody's off in their own --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, everybody's going in a different direction.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well --
R:  One time um my son -- and this would have been like fifteen years ago -- he had a friend over for dinner and, you know, I was fixing something in the kitchen, spaghetti or something and I was setting the table and Bobby said, "We're going to eat at a table?" --
L:  Oh.
R:  And I said, "Yeah".  He goes, "Everybody together?" --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I said, "Yeah".  He goes, "We usually fix our own stuff and eat in front of the TV when we want" --
L:  Oh.
R:  I said, "Well, here we all eat together" --
L:  See.
R:  -- and he goes --
L:  See, that's a value right there.
R:  -- "That's kind of cool".
L:  Important.  Yeah.  It is.  I think that's gre- [LAUGH] for somebody that didn't even notice that.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  It was just so different to him.  Like, "Oh, hey, I -- I kind of like this" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I mean, talking to all these people instead of just staring at the tube.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, that's kind of a neat experience to have had, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] To say, wow, I --
R:  And --
L:  -- guess I am normal [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Yeah.  I know.  With the two of us now, we don't eat at the table as much we used to, but it's not because of that.  I mean --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it just -- it just happens sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and -- [SIGH] faster pace, I guess.  But --
R:  It is.
L:  Um -- I don't know.
R:  So --
L:  I -- I don't know.  I think my son was a little bit wary.
