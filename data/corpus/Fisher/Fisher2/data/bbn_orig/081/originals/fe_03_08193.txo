L:  Hi, my name is Tenora.
R:  Hi Tenora.  My name's Tanya, I live in Hawaii, where do you live?
L:  I live in the Bronx, New York.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yes.  New York City.
R:  How old are you, Tenora?
L:  I'm thirty six.
R:  Thirty six.  Okay.  I'm -- I'm fifty nine and I'm a teacher --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so the -- and interestingly enough, I'm a math teacher, but next year, because we have less students, I'm being asked to teach ninth grade English --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so, this topic about assigning books is very relevant to me since I never even have taught English before.  What's your feeling, Tenora, when you were in school, did you ever have somebody assign a book that your family objected to?
L:  No, my family wasn't too involved in ah education, so they didn't know what I was bringing home, you know, they --
R:  So, that wasn't a problem.
L:  Right.  It wasn't no problem at all.
R:  Did you read anything that you thought was not appropriate?
L:  Ah, no.  Not that I could remember.  But I do have a school age son --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm into all his business and th- --
R:  How old is he?
L:  He's eleven.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so -- so, um, have you had any problem w- is he in public school?
L:  He's in public school, yes, he's on the --
R:  And have you had any problems --
L:  -- three public schools.
R:  -- with the things he's reading.
L:  Ah, some stuff, yeah.  Some stuff, you know, um, go against everything I'm teaching him, like with the sorcery books and stuff that I'm really--
R:  With what books, I'm sorry, what?
L:  Sorcery.  Like sorcery and magic books and witchcrafty books --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I have a problem with those.  I think those should be --
R:  You mean they're teaching, they -- are they teaching 'em -- are they requiring 'em in school?
L:  They are requiring them, yes.  They're reading, you know, they're reading these books and they have to, you know, read book reports on them, you know, do book reports on them.
R:  Oh, are you talking about maybe like --
L:  For the communication arts class.
R:  Well, like Harry Potter or what?
L:  Right.  Harry Potter and a couple of ah little books like Goosebumps um --
R:  Oh, I see what you're saying.
L:  -- those Goosebumps series, they have a lot of --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- little witchy --
R:  So they're -- they're -- they're -- and they're all fictional, they're presented as fictional, but you'd rather no- he didn't read that kind of thing?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Oh, I see what you're seeing.
L:  I mean, I let him read it but I -- it's after a big speech, you know, as to how, you know I --
R:  Got it.
L:  -- I feel about it and what I -- what -- that's a little --
R:  Yeah.  Got it.  Well, that sounds very responsible of -- of you.  Have you talked to the teacher?
L:  No, I haven't.  No.  No.  Because I feel that I -- you know, I do a good en- ah -- good enough job ah with my son, ah telling him, you know, how I feel about the materials --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they have to -- what he has to do because I'm also exposed to stuff that I don't really believe in, but you still have to do what you have to do --
R:  Right.  Right.  And I think that sounds ah I- if you -- if you don't allow them sometimes then they think it's really more exciting and --
L:  Right.  And it's good that he --
R:  -- you know, they --
L:  -- gets exposed, but also it's good that he knows --
R:  He knows the other side of it, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  That's interesting.  You know, not -- that's in- I hadn't ever really thought of that topic.  I was thinking in terms of ah sexually explicit or religious belie- you know, creation --
L:  Well, yeah, well, that wa- --
R:  -- [inaudible] or something that --
L:  -- that would go into -- that has religious connotations, the um, you know, the witchery and ah and the --
R:  Right.  But at least it's not being presented as true, I mean, it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- being presented as story.
L:  Right.  And that's the --
R:  But on -- on the other hand --
L:  -- point --
R:  -- I don't have an eleven year old, so I don't know what -- if they make the distinction really well.
L:  What's real, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What's real and what's not.  So, that's what you have to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- make sure that they know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that this is not real and --
R:  Yeah.  So, that's -- I guess that's part of the education process that the parents do have to help with, because --
L:  Right.  Definitely.
R:  -- it's not I -- I remember um -- this has nothing to do with the books -- but when I was teaching a long time ago I -- I was kidding the kids, I said, "You gotta watch out, I used to be a -- a warden in a women's prison" and I thought it was such -- I was like twenty three years old or something, long blond hair, didn't look anything like a warden, so I thought for sure they knew that it wasn't true --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was a joke --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but the kids came up to me a couple days later and asked me what prison it was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they totally believed it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I said, "Okay, don't do that again" to myself [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Children will believe anything you tell them.
R:  They will.
L:  This, well, yeah.
R:  Because you're the -- you're the authority figure up there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in front of them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I do think about that and I -- and I -- I will be thinking about that when I have to assign the reading things to the kids.  Um, the reason I was asking you about your particular situation is that if I -- you know, I will not choose a book to -- to the kids, if I think there's some particular objection but, you know, you can't always judge that and I wanted to know from the parent's point of view, you know, coming the other direction, how to talk with them because I have found talking with every parent I've ever talked with if you are working with what you -- can you do for that child in that class given an issue, they've been really helpful, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And we've always been able to work something out.  So, I -- I sort of thought, I don't know what you think of this, but I sort of thought that if a parent came to me with an objection, if it was well founded, in other words if they had a legitimate belief system that they -- and they came to me with a "What can we do?" that I would assign a different book, or make an alternative reading suggestion, in other words I -- I -- I like to pick my battles and this isn't one of them.  I don't want to have to make a child read something that their parents --
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  -- don't want them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to read.  That's why I asked if you'd been to talk to the teachers, because I don't know how -- how the teachers are reacting.
L:  Right.  Right.  Well, yeah, like I say, you know, I don't feel it's necessary because it's not going to harm him to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] educate --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, your beliefs.
R:  Right.
L:  And convey your r- your beliefs to the child that they -- they should be okay, because enjoys them.  He totally enjoys them, but he knows they're fake and sometimes he gets a little afraid --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, sometimes he ah --
R:  Well, not only that, but especially with Harry Potter, if he's the only kid that's not allowed to read them, boy, that would be really difficult --
L:  Exactly.  I don't want him to be, right, I don't want him to be made fun of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that.  So, I tell him, you know, you have to w- we have to do but, you know, they are [inaudible] you need to know or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I speak to him and, you know, it -- it's working out.  It's working out for my household.
R:  Good.
L:  You know.
R:  I -- I think it's wonderful because it's really what education's all about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is -- is being able to make your own choices, you know, even at -- you can't just say, "Okay, I'm going to wait till he's sixteen and then say, 'Now you can choose'", you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you have to teach them from the early days --
L:  From.  Right.
R:  -- that they can make those choices.  
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.
R:  Ah, yeah.  So, what would you um -- when he's -- what would you do -- what do you do about sex education kind of books in his school?  Do they give them that at age eleven or not?
L:  He hasn't said anything to me.  He has not said anything to me regarding um that at all and I've looked through his book bag and I haven't found anything.  I know he takes science and he knows about the reproduction system --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's all put so scientifically ah clean that I don't have --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- any objection with it.
R:  Great.
L:  At all.  I don't have any problems with it at all, you know --
R:  Great.
L:  -- they taught him all the body parts and what they do and --
R:  Mhm.  Are there any other parents that are objecting to that in your --
L:  No.
R:  -- school?
L:  Not at all.
R:  Good.  
L:  Not at all.  Not that I know of.
R:  Yeah, that's really -- that's great.
L:  Right.  It was -- it's --
R:  It's a tricky issue um, I --
L:  It is a tricky issue.
R:  -- at my school [LAUGH] at my school last year, which was a seventh and eighth grade school, the health teacher was doing that and of course the kids can get on the Internet and pull of pictures of, you know, who -- who knows what --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but -- and I don't know whether she provided them links or resources or whatever, but one -- one of our teachers, the kid came up and said something about how -- how can a baby get out this little hole and they showed him this picture of this woman's vagina, you know, from a -- prior to childbearing or something.  And so here's the t- you know, we're teachers, we're human too, we're not used to being confronted with pictures like that, oh, what's your opinion of this?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, it's hard to -- us -- for us to decide whether to play it cool or, you know [LAUGH] or go, oops [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And something -- [several inaudible words] it's a touchy subject, you know.
R:  It is a touchy subject for [inaudible] I'm -- I'm glad we're getting more -- can you compare to when you were in school?  Think how much more the kids are either exposed to or learn at early ages, you know, so --
L:  Yeah.  It's horrible.  The Internet now, I mean it's good and it's bad, you know the --
R:  Right.  But -- but --
L:  -- Internet now --
R:  Yeah, it's the -- the Internet --
L:  -- because there's so much infor- --
R:  -- thing is --
L:  It's --
R:  -- talk about the censorship problem --
L:  Yes.
R:  With the libraries you, I don't know if you know this, but the libraries are being asked to, like put on filters there so the kids can't look at pornography on the Internet in the libraries.
L:  Good.  Good --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  -- because in particular they just have to type one word and they get like two hundred sites --
R:  Ex- I know.  It's -- it's [inaudible] ding to me.
L:  Just one word.  Or something that sounds like that one word.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] Right.  Right.
L:  And they get -- and they didn't like it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they go --
R:  Right.  Absolutely.
L:  -- misspell -- they could misspell --
R:  It -- it's wild.
L:  -- something and they're gonna get --
R:  What do you --
L:  -- you know [LAUGH].
R:  What do you do in your own home, do you have a filter or something for your --
L:  No, in my own home, my mon- my computer's very monitored --
R:  In what -- oh, you mean that somebody's looking --
L:  -- and it's a privilege.
R:  -- at --
L:  Oh yeah, no it's --
R:  -- if your kid is using it or what?
L:  Oh yeah.  Well, no, but we monitor meaning he gets -- it's a privilege.  He can't get on unless I know about it and --
R:  Got it.
L:  -- he's earned it --
R:  Got it.  Oh, cool.
L:  -- and I have to be in the room with him.
R:  Uh-huh.  That's what I was wondering, yeah.
L:  Yes.  And I told him, "If you get into anything, there's a way I can find out, so you don't want momma", you know, so I pretty much like threatening um [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and heavy monitoring.
R:  Well, you thought -- you -- you sound really good because I -- I think giving kids things that they just are taking for granted, giving them to them as privileges really makes a difference --
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  -- that's ah -- it's my -- my view, too and to keep track of it.  And -- and, you know, you're kind of unusual too because most parents aren't able to spend that time or that energy to do that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I applaud you for doing that.
L:  Yeah, no, I -- I um, you know, I spend a lot of time with my son and um --
R:  Great.
L:  -- I'm always hel- you know, in his face, like he says --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "You're always in my face" that's right.
R:  Yeah, what did I -- I thought saw something on Oprah or something the other day about some parents who were like always in their kids' face --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- paying attention to 'em and they said at the time they thought it was horrible --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, because they couldn't do anything but at when they were talking on the show they were like twenty three and they said, "Thank you very much" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they do eventually, but it takes a while for them to appreciate --
L:  It takes a while.  They'll even say they hate you.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  I got my business, I don't appreciate you being in my face, but I think in the end it pays off, you know, at the end you see the ah --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- the rewards.
R:  And it's hard.  It's a long road.  And I see that, as a math teacher I see the same things because, you know, kids -- a lot of kids do not like to do math --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but if you don't make 'em do it then they're going to be in trouble because they won't have the skills they need for their further --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- classes --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and so you just have to not take it personally and say, "Sorry --"
L:  Yeah and a- --
R:  "-- I don't care whether you like it or not" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this is the way it's gonna be.
L:  I tell my son that math is not learned, math is practised.
R:  Good for you.
L:  So, he's like, okay, I say, you don't know something, just keep practising, practising, practising.  
R:  Very good.
L:  Because that's how I got through is like I was
