L:  Hello, this is Rebecca from Indiana.
R:  And this is May from Saint Paul, Minnesota.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Um, our topic is -- it was two questions, wasn't it?
L:  Yeah.  Yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, how divorces al- -- if divorce has altered your behavior and what was the other one?
L:  Um, uh-oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  She said that so quickly, I wrote down --
L:  I know.
R:  -- altered behaviors and then, oh I know.  Has it changed your ideas of the institution of marriage?
L:  Oh.  Okay.  All right.
R:  Does that sound right?
L:  That sounds right.
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  Go ahead [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Well, um, altered behaviors.  Um, I am a public school teacher and I guess one area where I know I have had to alter my behavior is that you have to be very, very sensitive to children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you can absolutely never assume that that child is coming from an intact home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so [SIGH] when you ask questions about parents, about mom or dad, you just have to learn to, you know when they say, "Well, I don't know where my dad is, I live with my grandpa" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you just answer with this real positive, "Well, that's so nice that you live with your grandpa" and you know things aren't quite the truth, but you always --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I always feel like I want to make that child feel as normal as possible.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  How about you?
L:  [SIGH] Well, um, I come from a ah a big line of divorces in my family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I've been married for twenty six years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I understand from the kids' point of view what divorce does --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know if that's one of the q- I don't -- I don't like divorce, I -- I -- when I got married I -- we didn't -- I just hope it never happens.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, I don't know.  People just don't take marriage -- they take it too lightly.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  I think you should have to go through a bunch of -- you know how like in some religions you have to do a lot of things with the pastor or the priest or whatever --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- to get married?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You should have to go through a lot of counselling before you get a divorce.
R:  Well, I agree and I think more and more of our churches are getting into that where --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you are required to take classes and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you are required to take psychological tests --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to make sure that there is a level of compatibility --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and um required to discuss hot point issues that always crop up within a marriage --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think that's a -- a very good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I too, um, I am divorced myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um I hate it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, it is the most single devastating thing that has ever happened to me.
L:  Yeah, I saw my mom go through it.  It's horrible.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  But you know, a lot of times even to -- you know, today, I mean we know -- I know a lot of young people that they just don't respect marriage at all I mean it's like I don't under- I just -- I don't understand it myself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I really don't understand people because they think they s- they're so -- they think so much about theirself, they forget about their kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And kids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't -- I -- I'm an adult from a marriage and you d- I -- I always remember, you don't ever forget --
R:  No.  You don't ever forget.
L:  No.
R:  You can -- some of the pain eases and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you can forgive um whoever you felt you were wronged by --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um but you -- you don't necessarily even want to forget --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- um, yeah, I know.  Um, but as far as has it altered my view of the institution of marriage?  I would say I -- I value and treasure the institution of marriage --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- more as an older adult --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than I ever did as a younger person just because I have a better understanding --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- of how love deepens --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as you go through life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with your um spouse.
L:  Yeah.  You don't realize that when you're young [LAUGH].
R:  No, you don't realize that when you're young.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Because --
L:  You truly don't.
R:  No.  No, definitely not.  And [SIGH] um, yeah, and I really think, you know, that as -- as the um institution of a marriage if it continues to break down,  I -- I believe it has --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- nationwide consequences.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  When the family breaks down, um, we're really in big trouble and we are in big trouble right now.
L:  Right.  Oh, oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know if people are -- if -- if people are religious and they read the bible --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- marriage was intended for me- a man and woman --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there's so much of this stuff going on, it's just like -- I'm just -- I can't believe it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We live near Chicago, we're in Indiana, but we live near Chicago and they just had the big gay parade --
R:  Oh, did they?
L:  -- and I --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- some of the sp- -- I s- I saw on TV, I've n- I'm -- I've never seen in my life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never seen that and I'm like, "Oh, my God" I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  It's very alien to a Christian point of view.
L:  It definitely is [LAUGH].  Definitely is.  And you -- you being a public school teacher, you must see all kind of things.
R:  Well, you know, we do, we hear all kinds of things and we have a um a recent principal hire in our district --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she is a gay woman --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um but, you know, the woman herself is so likeable --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- and she's so good at what she does and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know, that's something that I personally I pray about because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you got to love these people, you don't have to say --
L:  Right.
R:  -- "I agree with what you're doing" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but you can't reject them and --
L:  Yeah.  God says, "Hate the sin, not the sinner".
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Well, my husband is a pastor [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, is he?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's why I don't know, I just -- my -- my husband is a pastor and his brother is also a pastor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and both of -- our -- both of us, them, they've been married --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but everyone else in the family, parents on both sides, sisters, brothers, everyone's divorced.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And it's so weird because everything, what is that saying?  The grass always looks greener on the other side, but it's not [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.  No, it isn't.
L:  Because when you jump over, you're still taking yourself.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And, you know, I don't know.  People just don't seem to appreciate marriage anymore.
R:  Yeah.  And there's this funny attitude that if you live together you can test the marriage and then you'll know whether or not you're suited for marriage.
L:  I don't think so.
R:  And you know, the national statistics on that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are that um the divorce rate is higher among people who have lived together before marriage.  There is also more domestic violence among those couples.
L:  Mm.
R:  And there's a higher rate of depression.
L:  I wonder why?
R:  Oh, I think because --
L:  I mean, if you've lived together, I mean why would you go crazy when you got married?  A piece of paper?
R:  Well, I think that once you're married -- I -- I don't know, except that I think there must be a certain um --
L:  Finality.
R:  -- could there be a loss of respect?
L:  Oh.  Huh.
R:  Both for your partner and maybe for yourself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I don't -- what was -- what was one of -- what was one of those questions? [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  It was, have your o- behaviors been altered and have your views changed on the institution of marriage?
L:  Well, I -- I think I would probably say no to both.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I feel the same that I always have, basically --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is so strange because I wasn't rai- I -- I was raised up in a divorce, but now that my mother is older and she looks back, because she's told me before that if she had to -- if she could do it -- I mean, you can't, but if she could do it all over again --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she would have stayed married.
R:  Is that what she says?
L:  Yeah.  She was the one -- she -- it was -- she is the one that didn't want the marriage anymore, after three kids.
R:  Oh.
L:  Wanted to have more and do more and see more and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now that she's older now, she's in her sixties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she looks back and she sees and all her children have been divorced, some of my sisters, multiple --
R:  Is that right?
L:  -- yeah.  I'm the oldest and I'm the only one [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, for goodness sake.
L:  Only by the grace of God, ah I'm --
R:  Well, yeah, that's probably the case for all of us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who manage to stay married for a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a length of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I can't say that about my divorce.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I still know my ex husband --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he -- the marriage never would have worked.
L:  Oh.
R:  And um I remarried and we've been married for twenty -- almost twenty three years.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  So, [SIGH] um, but I don't know, it's -- it's an interesting question --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but as far as altered behaviors, no.  I would say my only altered behavior is how I treat children.  I'm just more cautious about what I say and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my responses because I try to be sensitive to them.
L:  Yeah.  We have two daughters that, well, they're both in college now, but they um -- it's amazing how many of their friends, none of them either have -- or both of them have their mom -- their dad's --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- not in the picture or their dad has a family, a new family --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know and they don't feel included in that family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I don't know, it's just so sad.  It's like they're the weird ones.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know what it's like?
R:  That's too bad.
L:  It's weird.
R:  And you know, blended marriages are really hard.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, I can -- I can't imagine how you do that.
R:  Yeah.  It is --
L:  I bet it would be hard.
R:  -- just really difficult.  What denomination is your husband a pastor at?
L:  We're Baptist.
R:  Baptist?
L:  Yeah.  Fundamental Independent Baptist.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I have a sister who's a Lutheran pastor --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and she is married to a Lutheran pastor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so --
L:  Hm.  Well, I was raised Catholic, my family's Catholic so --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  And you ended up as a Baptist?
L:  Yes, I did.  Yeah, I never --
R:  That --
L:  -- I never understood a lot of it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  As I was growing up.  I went to mass, I went to Catholic school, but some of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- didn't make no sense to me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Well, that is quite a switch.
L:  It is.  It definitely --
R:  You know, I'm going to have to stretch my phone, I've got someone at my front door, but I don't feel I can cut off this call.
