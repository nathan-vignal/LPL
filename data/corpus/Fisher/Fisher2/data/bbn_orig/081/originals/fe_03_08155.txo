R:  [MN]
L:  Hello? [LAUGH] My name is Rhonda Anders.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  How are you?  I'm Pam.
L:  I'm sorry, what was that?
R:  Ah, my name is Pam.
L:  Pam, my name is Rhonda.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Good to meet you [LAUGH].
R:  [inaudible] Is this your first call?
L:  It is.
R:  Yeah, mine too.  What do you know?
L:  It is, actually [LAUGH].
R:  Interesting topic, huh?
L:  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  I was kinda worried about the topic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, are you married?
L:  Um, I am and I have two children, they're um five and thir- -- well, almost six and three.
R:  Okay.
L:  Three and a half.  So ... [LAUGH].
R:  Wonderful.  And I am married too.  I'm -- actually, we just celebrated our twentieth anniversary --
L:  Wow, that's great.
R:  -- and I have a son who is nine and a half, he's our only child.
L:  Oh, okay.  My --
R:  So, obviously we both believe in marriage, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My husband and I have been married, let's see, about eleven and a half years --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So --
R:  Wonderful.
L:  So, yeah.  Yeah, definitely [LAUGH].  The divorce rate is kind of scary.
R:  It is.  I -- I just think people [SIGH] I don't think they're taking it as seriously, you know, as I feel that it needs to be taken, it's taken too lightly, you know --
L:  Right, you mean marriage in -- in general?
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I agree.  When my husband and I got married we just didn't really consider divorce as an option, so [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, absolutely.  [MN]
L:  So, I just figured we would um, you know, just consider that and just have to work through your problems [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.  Right.
L:  And that's it.  So --
R:  Mm.  Just open up a People magazine and it's like, "Whoa" you know, I mean, someone's married today and next week they're getting divorced and remarried [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  Um, yeah, I think one of the questions was, um, you know, the -- has d- divorce rate changed your views on marriage?  For me, I -- you know, I don't think it has because I've always thought of it, you know, in the traditional sense, I guess, so --
R:  That's right.  I mean, it's --
L:  So, um -- 
R:  And I --
L:  -- so it definitely is a scary thing [LAUGH].
R:  Right. 
L:  Seeing how many people do, I think, take it -- take it too lightly --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and -- and um --
R:  I think a lot of times it has to do too with what you see, you know, and what the family that surrounds you and, you know, how seriously they're taking marriage too.  I mean, if --
L:  Right.
R:  -- your family, I don't know how your family is, but I know we don't have any divorce in my family and, I mean, I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing, but I think if that happens a lot of times and it seems to be repeated down the line --
L:  Right.
R:  -- more, you know?  So ...
L:  Right.  Yeah.  And I -- my parents and my grandparents, of course, are --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, never got divorced or anything.
R:  Right.
L:  I do have a brother who's divorced, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't think that was his choice [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Right [MN] --
L:  So [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  But, yeah, and I -- I know what you mean, that kinda -- it kinda does seem to -- to um, run, you know, just the -- the view people get of it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and think, "Well, if it doesn't work, we'll just get a divorce" [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And just move on from there, you know and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I know, it's -- it's certainly not easy.  I mean a good marriage is going to have lots of problems and lots of up and downs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all of the [inaudible] just need to work through 'em.  So, I think it's like you said, it's the attitude that you take, you know?  So [SIGH].
L:  Right.  Um, one thing I -- I don't know if it was something else [inaudible] or maybe it was something my husband was telling me that he read in the paper or something that now it's like they're making it possible like to just quickly get divorces over the Internet and [LAUGH] --
R:  I did hear about that.  I had, yeah.
L:  You had -- you heard about that?
R:  Yeah.  That is bizarre.
L:  Yes.  I --
R:  I mean, you know --
L:  -- and, you know, my husband said, "What if you just get mad and decide to do that one day --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- and then, you know, a few days later change your mind or something?" you know.
R:  Right.  Sure.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So, you said you've been married what, eleven years?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.  Very good.  Good.  So --
L:  Yeah and -- and, you know, like you said, it's not always easy, but [LAUGH].
R:  No, it certainly isn't.  Certainly isn't.  But um I don't know, I thought they were going to give us more to talk about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than just one little subject here, it's kinda --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] --
L:  It's kinda --
R:  -- kinda hard to think --
L:  -- sometimes hard to talk about that for ten minutes, isn't it?
R:  It is.  I never really realized how hard it is to talk about --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- some little thing.  You know?
L:  My um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my grandparents actually they had celebrated their um, their seventieth wedding anniversary a few years ago --
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  -- so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, that's nice.  See, there you go --
L:  So -- 
R:  There's still hope for all of us out there, right [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I think there definitely is.
R:  And I think, you know, too, like raising your children, you know, and -- and teaching them by what they, you know, what they see in us too, hopefully that's going to instill in them, you know, good values in as far as, you know, I mean, like we're always telling our son, you know, you don't get married until you get to know someone a long time and, you know, God tells you, you know, you really should only be married once, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- although sometimes, you know, it happens other ways and just trying to instill in him, you know, the whole thing about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a good marriage so he hopefully isn't going to be divorcing, you know?
L:  Right [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  You hope that [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well, we hope.  Of course, there's no --
L:  You teach them and then -- and then they have to kind of make their own --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- own choices.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So [LIPSMACK] these kids are being good while we're -- when you're talking on the phone now, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] They're not always.
R:  Well, I know.  I know how that goes, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  They're not always that um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I -- oh and I had another thought that I -- left my mind [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Hm.  That's kinda --
L:  I think of it again.
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH]. Where do you live?
L:  Um, I live in Indiana, just --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  -- right outside Indianapolis.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Okay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, we're in Illinois, so we're next to you.  That's -- that's --
L:  Are you?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We were actually in Illinois last week [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?  Ok- --
L:  So, we -- we went to Navoo[?] --
R:  To -- I don't --
L:  -- um and for a few days and stuff, so --
R:  What is it called?
L:  Navoo, it's on the -- Illinois Iowa border, the western --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- border so --
R:  Oh, okay.  Never heard of it there.  Hm.  Okay.  Interesting.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Well, I know we're getting off topic here, but I'm just trying to -- I'm trying to think [LAUGH] what else to say.
L:  What part of Illinois do you ...?
R:  We are in the southwest suburbs of Chicago.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  I n- --
L:  I actually have a brother and sister in law that I think live in the Aurora [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- neighborville area.
R:  Okay.  They're a little bit north, kinda northwest of us then, yeah, not too far down from us.  Mhm.  Yeah.  Very good.  Good.
L:  Yeah [LIPSMACK]
R:  So [LIPSMACK] I'm trying to think of the to- they want us to talk about values --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and [LAUGH] [inaudible] I -- I don't know, the institution of marriage, I don't [LIPSMACK] hm.
L:  Well, we definitely --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- try to instill those values in our children as well and [LAUGH] you know, and everything.  I'm [SIGH] the -- sometimes it doesn't seem very easy, but [LAUGH] maybe they --
R:  Well, especially because --
L:  -- are listening [LAUGH].
R:  Well, and they're so young too.
L:  Mine are young.
R:  But I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I mean even you know my son, too, he'll come up with funny things when he talks about marriage, you know, that even when he's married he's still going to live with us, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  "Mom, when I get married I'm still going to live with you.  Is that okay?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Well --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- Sammy, I think it's okay, but I don't know that your wife's going to want to do that" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] She may have different feelings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  My -- my children --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, "I'm going to get married" or "I'm not going to get married" [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, sure.  Sure.
L:  Or, or whatever, they're -- they're little, but it's funny they pick up and they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they talk about that [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think probably the biggest thing is just example, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Like you said, if you see, you know, others that you're around and your family and such --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you see them have good marriages and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not um, you know, not a lot of divorces and such then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think it's easier, you know, you get those values instilled in you just by -- by watching and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R:  And it gets confusing, because my son obviously he's a little bit older than your kids, but --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- he's in grade school, so he's around some kids in his class for instance that moms and dads, you know, may be divorced, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, when you have a child that spends a week with mom, the weekend with dad and different stuff like that, so then we find ourselves having to kind of explain someone else's life, you know, kind of not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- knowing so much about it too.  We're like, you know, the marriage didn't work out and we have -- sometimes they have two moms and sometimes they have two dads, you know, it --
L:  Right [LAUGH] --
R:  -- kind of telling him --
L:  -- it is hard for children to understand that.
R:  Right.
L:  My um -- my brother -- my youngest brother has um a daughter, he was never married, but he has a daughter and him and his girlfriend are no longer together and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- him and his daughter live with my parents and so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my daughter you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- calls her grandmother, my mother, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- she -- she thinks she's this -- this little girl's mom [LAUGH].
R:  Oh boy.
L:  And you know, I have to try telling her, "No, it's her grandma, just like she's your grandma" --
R:  Sure.
L:  She's Liberty's grandma too, you know.
R:  Oh that has to be so confusing.
L:  And -- yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  But she -- but she calls her, "Liberty's mom", you know -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Gee.
L:  And, you know, she thinks it's her mother and you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sometimes they go to visit her mother and I tried to explain to them, "Well, that you know she's going to go see her mother" and --
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, god.
L:  And it's just hard for them to understand that.
R:  It is.  It is.
L:  So --
R:  But in a way, I mean it's, you know, it -- it kind of lets them see life.  I mean, these are things that happen in life, you know, and trying to -- I mean, not that -- I mean, not that we want to talk good about divorce, but --
L:  [NOISE]
