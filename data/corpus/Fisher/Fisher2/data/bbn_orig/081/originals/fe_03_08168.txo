L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Cheryl.  I'm from Salem, Oregon.
R:  Oh, cool.  I'm Becky and I'm from Freemont, California.
L:  Oh.  Where is Freemont?  We were just down there in the San Francisco area.
R:  Um, Freemont is across the br- like Oakland is across the bay --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so it's across the bay and south of Oakland.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [MN] And um so that's where we are.
L:  Okay.  And um let's see, I'm a stay at home mom with three kids, ah sixteen, eleven and five.
R:  Oh, cool.  I'm a stay at home mom, although that may be coming close to an end [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have four kids.  Um, one almost twenty four, ah a twenty one year old, an eighteen year old and a fourteen year old.
L:  Oh, good --
R:  So --
L:  -- space out there.
R:  Hm?
L:  So, you have some kids out of college then, or in college, or just --
R:  I have one that graduated last year and one that's in college now and one that's starting college in the fall.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it's been a very busy time of life.  I -- I thought it was supposed to get easier --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but it didn't [LAUGH].  It doesn't.
L:  It's supposed to happen sometime [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Some day, some year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Well, let's see.  Um, the divorce rate.  Has it changed my views?  Um, or how I view things, I guess, is that the question?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Um, I don't think so.  I've been ah divorced once --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um I was married about ten years that time and this time I've been married thirteen so far and ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, the -- the divorce rate never really affected me.
R:  Hm.  Mhm.
L:  How about you?  It um --
R:  Well, I think [MN] and I think because I have kids, um, my oldest one is married, ah just got married, and [LIPSMACK] um my third one, my daughter, is contemplating marriage, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I think in a lot of way ah I think in a lot of ways it has ah and my brother's been through a couple of divorces.  I think it h- it's -- I think it's strengthened some of my values, um [LIPSMACK] because [MN] everyone I know [LAUGH] not everyone I know, but I know a lot of people who are just really struggling --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um to stay married and ah in our society it -- it is so much easier now than it used to be to get a divorce and I think it's -- it's kind of strengthened some of my back [SIGH] I want to say values, I think it's strengthened my idea of marriage, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah to -- to the point that you really got to think this through [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.  I -- I --
R:  -- before you make that --
L:  -- agree with you there.
R:  -- commitment, you know?
L:  I -- I see -- I think it's sad that I -- I see some people get married now and right off the bat I'm thinking, "This isn't going to last" you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you can just almost tell from seeing them as they're dating the arguing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things like that.  And you're thinking, "Why are you getting married?" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I've even seen people that I knew right away, "It's not going to last" and within you know five, six years, yeah, they're divorced.  Of course, they had a kid in the process who then has to go through that --
R:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and ah but I -- I do think sometimes kids just kind of rush into it and don't think about it and a lot of times, you know, their own parents are divorced.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know.  And -- and you do run into a lot of people and I know -- I was just thinking yesterday at a barbecue we were at, um, that everybody there had been --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- basically all the adults um had been divorced at least once.
R:  Oh, wow.  Mhm.
L:  And that just kind of hit me, wow --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, we're all doing, it's like the second time is the, you know, is the way it should be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- should have been the first time, but um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you just kind of think, "Gosh, they've all been through it" almost like you had to have a -- a bad one to recognize a good one.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  So --
R:  -- I've wondered that.  Um --
L:  Because I know a lot of people that the first one just, you know, was just didn't work, you know, never should have happened, um, couldn't make it work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the second one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- boy, you know, going strong, looks like it'll last forever.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And it -- it almost seems like they just needed one to be bad and to realize what they wanted.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  What you want and what you don't want and then you kind of look for that the second time around.
R:  Or maybe to even realize what marriage is.
L:  Right.
R:  Because --
L:  You kind of tend to grow --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the first time around, you're not, you know, that's a whole new thing, having somebody around you twenty four hours a day, having the responsibilities --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, not just children, but financial and all that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, dealing with two sets of families.  All that.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Now, my parents are divorced, but have been divorced for at least twenty years, I'm thinking, but my husband's parents, they've been -- you know, they're seventy -- seventies and they've been married, you know, thirty, forty years.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And I think it's great and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think, you know, I'd like to be like that [LAUGH].
R:  My ah grandmother just died in April and she was ninety four.  She and my grandfather had been married for seventy two years.
L:  Wow.
R:  And my grandfather said to me, he said, "I know it was seventy two years, but it wasn't long enough" --
L:  Oh, that's sweet.
R:  And I thi- you know, and I've been around them a lot.  They -- they kind of bicker and sometimes and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think they knew what the idea of commitment was.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think they had a lot of similar mm family circumstances --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of similar values that kept them together and I think it's more than just attraction.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, we see a lot of that on the movies nowadays [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And I think that's why I keep reiterating with my daughter, you know, okay, you need to think about this.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know. [LAUGH] Just, I mean, we -- we're all unique --
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  -- but my -- my idea of marriage is, you know, once you commit, this is it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  And really make sure you want to spend the rest of your life --
R:  Yeah.  You know?
L:  -- with this person, good and bad.
R:  Good and bad.  And -- and I -- I do try and point out some good things and some bad things to her, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I want you to think about this now because now you can say, "Well, I don't want to live with that" but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- after you make that commitment, you know, now is the time to think about it, not after [LAUGH].  And --
L:  And children's a big topic with, you know, some people get married without ever really discussing that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And find, you know, a little bit later, maybe then one of them, "Well, I really don't think I want kids" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the other one does and that's just a major life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- undertaking that you really should have decided that before you got married --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because then maybe that person wasn't for you.
R:  Or we tend [LAUGH] yeah, I see this in my daughter is that, you know, i- she says, "I don't want too many kids", you know, maybe one is just enough, where he wants a lot.  And I'm thinking, "Okay, who do you think's going to change here?"
L:  Right.
R:  You can't go into marriage expecting that person to change.
L:  No.
R:  You have to accept them for what they are now.  And it doesn't mean they're not going to change.  They're going to change.  But you have to be willing to change with them [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, so you kind of have to weigh all these angles together and um [LIPSMACK] yeah, I think the divorce rate does scare me [LAUGH].
L:  It -- it seems it getting -- to be getting worse, I think, because people are just -- it's easy to get married and it's easy to get divorced --
R:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ah I think, you know, seeing all these celebrities in California that are just c- cooling it one day and then divorce the next, I mean, it shouldn't be that easy.
R:  That's right.
L:  Um, it's easy for them, I guess.  Easier than the normal people, but um --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- speaking of grandparents, um, my grandparents, I mean they're -- they both died in their nineties within --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- five years ago and um they're a couple that even my mom and my aunt, their children, felt that they should have been divorced years ago --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- because they just argued all the time, they weren't loving with each other, they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my grandfather complained about everything.  He was just not a happy person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my grandmother on the ha- other hand, was just this great mother, so into her kids, you know, just doing crafts all the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- happy, happy, happy, you know.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they always thought that she would have been so much better off is she would have divorced him and found someone more like herself.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And um but back then that wasn't acceptable.
R:  That's right.
L:  So, of course she stayed with him.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I'm sure she never even thought of divorcing him.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And -- and I don't know what the divorce rate was, you know, fifty years ago, back before it became so easy and --
R:  Yeah.  Huh.
L:  -- almost the norm.
R:  Yeah, I don't know either.
L:  It's like people were -- aren't afraid to go into marriage now sometimes because they know it's easy to get divorced.
R:  Yeah.  My other set of grandparents were also married for fifty years, yet between the four kids, of the four -- both of set of grandparents, they had a combination of four kids -- only one out of the four remained married until their spouse died.  There were three divorces.  And I'm -- I think, what -- "What happened from this generation to this generation?" does that make sense?
L:  Right.  Right.  I  --
R:  And all of the grandkids [MN] there's only out of one, two, three, out of five grandkids, there's one out of the five that has not been divorced.
L:  Wow.
R:  So --
L:  Different there.  Huh.
R:  It -- it is a big difference.  And I think that's what scares me [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  I know my son's sixteen and he's dating a nineteen year old and, you know, she's just sweet and you can just tell they're so -- so in love, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Um, but -- and I guess they've been talking, you know, when they get out of college, marriage and things like that and I'm thinking, "Slow down a bit" you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "You've got a ways to go, you've got college and there's a lot of things that can happen in college"
