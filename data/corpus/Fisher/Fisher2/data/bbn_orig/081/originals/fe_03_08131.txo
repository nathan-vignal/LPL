L:  Hi, I'm Laura.
R:  Hi, I'm Cara.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  Fine.
R:  Happy fourth of July.
L:  You too.  I couldn't believe they called on the fourth of July.
R:  I know.  I know.  I was surprised too.  But um ... so, what do you think?
L:  People remaining calm?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah -- probably not.
R:  Yeah, I don't think so either [LAUGH].
L:  Um, but then again after what happened, on the eleventh, you never know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, how would I react? I'd panic.
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  That I know for sure.
R:  Yeah.  Me too.  Definitely.  [SIGH] I think ah where I live people would panic --
L:  And where are you at?
R:  I'm in Mississippi right now.
L:  Okay.  We're in Chicago, so --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're in a big city, so ... I'm in a small, little city.
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we'd um --
R:  So --
L:  -- they've -- they've just finished doing a -- a drill, oh probably about a month ago --
R:  I think I heard about that.
L:  Yeah.  And from what I had heard, everything turned out like really good, better than expected and that there weren't any problems or anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but ah I'd still, you know, it's hard to tell, you know.
R:  I think for the most part, people would panic.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  I think anyone would, though, I mean it's not something you can totally stay calm about [LAUGH].
L:  No, no.  You can't.
R:  Only the --
L:  And, you know, again, after September eleventh, look at how that -- everybody's going to revert back to that --
R:  Mhm.  Of course.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Of course.
L:  Everybody's going to go, "Well, this is how this was handled-- " 
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- how do we know it's not going to be that way again?"
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know.  So, it's -- it's hard to tell.  Most people probably would panic.  I for sure would.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I've got four kids.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, you know, --
R:  You've got to --
L:  -- panicking would be um definite.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm sorry, this phone call kind of took me by surprise, I wasn't expecting it, like you said.
L:  I wasn't either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wasn't either.  That was like totally weird.
R:  Yeah.  How many have you gotten so far?
L:  Ah, this is my -- actually this is my fourth call.
R:  Really?  You got four?
L:  Um, but the third one I got disconnected right away, so --
R:  Oh, okay.  This is my second.
L:  But -- yeah, they're quick and easy and --
R:  I know.  It's like, why not?  Why not do it?
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  And if they're going to pay you ten bucks to do it.
R:  I know, who wouldn't do it?
L:  -- [inaudible] right.
R:  And it -- it's interesting too to meet different people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so ...
L:  That's for sure.
R:  But see, I -- we answered the question so quickly that what else is there [LAUGH]?
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It's kinda -- ten minutes is a long time.
L:  Yeah.  The most of the time it doesn't seem like it's that long --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it seems a lot shorter because they're topics that you can really -- that you can really talk about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, this one was kind of a no brainer, so [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  That's for sure.  There's not as many -- there's not as many different views --
R:  I know.  It's kind of [SIGH] one or the other.  And usually --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's panic.  So [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  Yeah.  But ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  So, you have a lot planned today?
L:  Um, just kind of a barbecue.
R:  Yeah?  Us too.
L:  [NOISE] Just barbecuing over --
R:  Fireworks?
L:  -- oh, definitely.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Big.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Definitely.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Are they -- or -- are they pretty spectacular in Chicago?
L:  Um, they can be.  They can be.  Sometimes they are.  Ah, downtown's fireworks were last night --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were -- they're always incredible.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm from um Saint Paul, Minneapolis and they're always really, really great and now we moved to Mississippi just for a little bit and I -- I'm not [SIGH] expecting too much [LAUGH] from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Mississippi.  I don't know if there's going to be a lot of fires tonight with rednecks blowing their hands off or [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, the fire station's already --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to go and --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think I've ever heard it quite put that way [LAUGH].
R:  Well [LAUGH] they're -- I don't know [LAUGH] people down here aren't too bright, but I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that, but [LAUGH].
L:  Oh no, that's fine.  That just took me by surprise.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  Oh.  Let's see --
L:  But --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's like --
R:  It sounds like you're busy.
L:  Oh, I'm throwing together a vegetable tray.
R:  Oh, wow.  [MN] [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] It's a survey.
R:  Um.
L:  [NOISE] No.  Um, I have no idea.  [NOISE] Do you know what, [several inaudible words] so, I don't know.  [NOISE] This was really, really weird [NOISE] [LAUGH] now my sister's doing the ah [NOISE] music.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  That's always ah --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know what to say [LAUGH].
L:  I don't either.  I mean, we've talked about it already, so it's like --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and you're done.  You know.
R:  Let's see.  How long has it been?  It's been --
L:  It feels like it's been ten minutes --
R:  I know.  I know [LAUGH] I'm sorry, I'm not very interesting.  But --
L:  No, no, not -- that has nothing to do with it.  It's the fact that we've already talked about the issue and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what we were [inaudible] about it.
R:  Total strangers.  [MN] So --
L:  Go figure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where's the dip? [NOISE] Yeah, I know, but that doesn't help me any.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  [LIPSMACK] Ah, [NOISE] and that bag of stuff was terrible. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, no, the -- the stuff you asked me to look at it -- it [NOISE] stunk when I opened it. [NOISE] Uncle Tucker must stab you with the spoon [NOISE]. [LAUGH] Oh, my family is a bunch of jokesters.
R:  [LAUGH] They sound like a fun bunch.
L:  Oh, definitely.  What are your plans for today?
R:  Um, me and my boyfriend are just going to go to the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the fireworks out here in my town and see how they turn out and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we'll see.  We'll see.  We're going to have a little barbecue.  We don't have any friends here because ah my boyfriend's in the Navy and we're just here for a little bit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he um trains to fly jets --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so we're just here for a few more months.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But -- so we don't know anyone here, so it's just us, so --
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] Well, that's kinda nice, though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's gotta be kinda -- kinda lonely, but --
R:  Yeah, well, we're getting by.  We don't really like it here, but we're only here for a few more months, so we're excited to leave.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  It's been an experience, you know, yeah.  I don't think we'd ever come to Mississippi unless this happened, so ...
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, and the one thing, you know, ah about it is um you figure the area that you're in probably you don't have the threat of terrorism --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- like you have here.
R:  Yeah.  Except there is a -- the base here which is like -- they have high security --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and it's -- it's -- they train to -- they train to fly jets here, so they're kinda worried that, you know, terrorists will come and try to take a jet, or whatever.  So ...
L:  Right.  And, you know, now that you say that, I didn't even think about the fact that you're on a base.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's --
L:  And that's right there, that's a target.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  There's really high security there, so ...
L:  Yeah, that's a target right there.
R:  Yeah.  And it is -- there's only two bases that train jets for Navy, for the Navy and it's here and then Texas.  So, there's only two, so [SIGH] it's even --
L:  Which ah -- which base in Texas?
R:  Ah, Corpus Christi.
L:  Okay.  I don't know that one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, my cousin was at ah Ford Head[?].
R:  F- I don't know where that is.  That's in Texas?
L:  That's -- it's like central.
R:  Oh, is it like an Army base, or --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Must be if it's a fort.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of course it must, yeah.
L:  It's Army.
R:  Okay.  I don't -- I never --
L:  But ah --
R:  -- heard of that.
L:  See, and I didn't even think about, you know, when -- when you first said, you know, that you were transferred there, I didn't even think, you know, Armed Forces or anything.
R:  Yeah.  Oh yeah, it's a big military town, too, so --
L:  -- but --
R:  [MN]
L:  Okay.  But yeah, here in Chicago we've got, you know, the skyscrapers and --
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.
L:  -- you know, after September eleventh they were -- people were afraid to go to work --
R:  I bet.  I bet.
L:  They were [SIGH] the skills, to this day, so many people are afraid to fly.
R:  Go up on the Sears Tower, isn't that in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's our --
R:  Yeah, I'd be afraid to go up there [LAUGH].  Even now.  I think I'd be afraid.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm still afraid to go down there.  My kids want to go in it and I'm like, "Not yet" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I know.
