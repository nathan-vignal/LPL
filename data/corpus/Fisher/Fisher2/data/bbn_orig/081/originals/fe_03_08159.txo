R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Uh, my name's Richard.  I'm in Seattle.
L:  [MN] And I'm Melinda, and I'm in Illinois.
R:  Oh, cool.  
L:  [LAUGH] In the Chicago area.
R:  Right.  
L:  You know what --
R:  The only thing I know about Chicago is O'Hare [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When I've driven -- er, er -- ri- ridden the plane through.
L:  Well --
R:  And stopped at the horrible airport.
L:  [LAUGH] You just don't have the best experience in the [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  Was the -- uh, the topic family values?
L:  Well, you know what?  I was hearing this [MN] almost like she was talking through water.  I could --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- I could barely hear it or understand it.
R:  Me too.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I got something about fam- family values, I got something, um, [LIPSMACK] I think about [SIGH] the divorce rate and how the --
R:  Yes, I got that.
L:  -- yeah, but I didn't hear what, you know, they wanted us to talk about about that.
R:  Well, the last thing I heard was -- and it's interesting 'cause [SIGH] you're actu- -- she sounded all bubbly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like she was underwater, and I thought maybe it was just my cellphone.
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  'Cause I'm out in the middle of the street --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm in the [inaudible] I thought maybe that was the problem, but [SIGH] the thing I heard I think was, how has that affected your ideas about the institution of marriage?
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, you must be right, divorce rate and marriage.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Close enough.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH] But I didn't hear -- there was like a second part to it, and I didn't hear that at all.
R:  [SIGH] Well, um, they can't [MN] dock us for doing this --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and for, you know, it sounds like it was on their end, the problem.
L:  Yeah, very definitely.
R:  Yes.
L:  It was really hard for me to hear anything that she was saying, so --
R:  I haven't been married since ninety five.  I'm a widower and, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm never gonna be married again.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  'Cause it was that good, not because it was that bad.
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good for you.  Well, [SIGH] I've been divorced since, uh, oh, [NOISE] I don't know, eighty three, eighty four.
R:  Wow, okay.
L:  Yeah, a long time, and, um, it was a very abusive relationship and I had a lot of physical and, uh, emotional healing [NOISE] to do, so --
R:  Ow.
L:  -- I've kind of steered away from, you know, being -- being married too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I -- I have a little bit of a fear, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that -- that's dissipated over the years.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] but, you know, when you do see the divorce rate, it is kinda [NOISE] scary to people, I guess.
R:  It is.
L:  You know?  Um, I -- it's kinda of a [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- an irony, because, um [LIPSMACK], my faith kinda dictates that once you get married, that's it, you stay married, and, um --
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  -- I really believed that with all my heart, but I had to get out to save my life, and so I feel --
R:  But, you know, you are [SIGH] so brave [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause I have friends, you know, really, 'cause I have friends that are afraid to stay in, and afraid to try to get out.
L:  Oh, well, I was too, that's why I put up with it for twenty years.
R:  Twenty?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he was schizophrenic, so --
R:  How did you keep from being in mental hospital?
L:  Well, I almost didn't.  I mean, I was severely -- I -- I had had, um, a car accident that disabled my leg --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and I had Crohn's Disease, so I was battling a lot of illness and pain, [SIGH] and that didn't help my mental attitude at all either, you know, and so I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just felt like, how could I ever support my son?  How could I ever do this?  How could I ever ...?  You know?  And I was scared to death of him, and he had threatened that if I ever left him he'd kill me, so --
R:  Oh, wow.  Did you have to move?
L:  -- I mean -- yeah, well, um, kind of.  I had, [SIGH] like, five area pastors [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- with me on the day I left, because they said usually with schizophrenics, if they're gonna snap [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and actually, um, fulfil their threat, they probably do it when it, you know, comes real, on that day.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And so I had this little army of prayer warrior people [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  They had my back, you know.  And my son, my son is a pastor in the Chicago area, and so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- um, and he was in college at that time, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was just pretty well covered.  You know, I felt secure as I could feel, at that point.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, you know, I learned through therapy and stuff that not all guys are like that [NOISE] [LAUGH].
R:  No.
L:  They're not all totally crazy, you know, [LAUGH] and so ...
R:  You know, that's weird --
L:  So --
R:  -- 'cause I have a roommate and his girlfriend is going through exactly the same thing you just described.
L:  Wow.
R:  And she's [SIGH] having to move from the area not far from -- but to live with her mom, and she has --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- two kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean, he did really nasty things to her [NOISE].
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  And, you know, she said to my friend, [SIGH] she said, "Am I a loser magnet?" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Well, I have --"
L:  Well, you know --
R:  "-- loser, please -- please apply --"
L:  [MN] See, I -- I was --
R:  Oh, no [LAUGH].
L:  -- I really was, because, um, my dad was a very abusive person and I saw my mother get beat up and my sister and I got beat up and stuff, so [SIGH] it --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- didn't, you know, as long as the guy I married -- and I was only nineteen when I married him --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] as long as he wasn't a drunk, 'cause that was my dad's problem --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, then I figured everything was okay.  But I never banked on crazy [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so I was, you know, primed for that.  And actually, a couple of very short lived relationships I had after that [SIGH] were both very troubled men [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, I seemed to be [SIGH] [MN] -- a child of alcoholic parents usually wants to make everything okay for everybody.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know?  And, so, um, I seemed to find these people that need my help, and I should be finding someone who would like to help me [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  And so that's kind of what I learned in therapy, that -- that, you know, you try to find somebody that's more together than you are [LAUGH] and then maybe [inaudible].
R:  Or at least as much together [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  And I just think that the divorce rate is so high because people don't have a commitment [LIPSMACK] --
R:  No.
L:  -- uh, any more.  I mean --
R:  No, you're right.
L:  -- I think that's a very old fashioned thing, you know?  And, um, they just don't want to, you know, put up with anything that makes them uncomfortable.
R:  You're totally right.
L:  Yeah, and then, um, I think moreover it's [SIGH] a matter of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you do go through something that's a really bad experience, [LIPSMACK] when someone does something that is similar -- not, you know, maybe as horrific, but similar [SIGH] -- you tend to just cut and run.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, uh, I had to learn in therapy that not every man who got angry in traffic was gonna turn around and belt me in the mouth, you know? 
R:  Right.
L:  That a lot of men get angry in traffic, and that was okay [LAUGH].  And -- and I was, you know, taking some of the behaviors of my husband and my dad [SIGH] and if a man exhibited those behaviors, I ran, you know?  Because I --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- thought they were gonna be just as looney as [LAUGH] the other two.  [SIGH] And I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had to learn the difference between what is male behavior, what is female behavior, typically, you know?
R:  Yes. 
L:  And then, what is crazy behavior [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.
L:  So -- so I,  uh, I learned a lot on this journey [LIPSMACK], and I think I -- you know, I understand that it's probably -- the divorce rate is because there isn't commitment and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- people then [SIGH], you know, they say --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- second marriages, a lot of times, especially if you're divorced, don't work [LIPSMACK].  And I think that that's because people are so scared and the minute that their partner does something that freaks them, they wanna cut and run.  You know?
R:  I totally agree with that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But something they're making [MN] -- one -- another reason why I would [SIGH] -- my marriage wasn't perfect at all, but it met all of my needs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- as far as I [MN] knew, met, uh, you know, all of my partner's needs, but [SIGH] what really has made me sour on relationships --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is because I'm -- [SIGH] I'm not married, I've gone through a lot of roommates --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you don't know someone until you live with them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- every single day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause you see them at their very -- 'cause if someone wants to [SIGH] rent from you or with you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or,  you know, make their life easier by moving into your home, of course they're going to be on their very best behavior.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you don't see them every day.  And I've had nothing, except for my current one, [SIGH] I've had nothing but bad experiences.
L:  Yeah, it's rough, it's rough.
R:  And, as I said, you know, you don't know any- -- you don't know someone until you live with them.
L:  Well, you need to know -- I think for most people there's this infatuation period --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- where the person, you know, you're just so thrilled with getting to know them and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- learning all about them and you're --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- so clouded by love and attraction and stuff --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- and I think that, um -- well, I've been with a person -- I don't live with him [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but we've been seeing each other for almost eight years.
R:  Okay.
L:  And during those eight years, you know, we've -- we're kinda like a married couple.  We've gone from the --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- uh, tremendous attraction infatuation period --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- through really getting to know each other --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- through really getting to know our faults [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  And really getting mad at each other, and, um, we will --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably be married some day, but --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I said, "Hey, you know, I'm not going anywhere".
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so it doesn't matter to me, um, you know, I guess I would like to not be alone and [SIGH] -- and live my life out with someone.  I wanna do that very happily, [SIGH] so I wanna know somebody as much as I possibly can, you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, before that -- that time would come.  And so I think that that's just a really good rule of thumb.  But people [SIGH] -- you know, we've got fast food and want fast gratification and fast this and fast that, and so, you know, you know somebody for six months and you get married, and I think that's absolutely crazy [LIPSMACK], you know?
R:  And [MN] what made [SIGH] my marriage [SIGH] m- more meaningful to me is when we had to go through rough times --
