L:  Leah.
R:  Hi.  This is Jamie.
L:  Hi.  Jeanie?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  I'm good, thanks.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, did you hear the topic?
L:  Yeah, how do you feel about the banning of smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in public places?
R:  Yeah.  Actually, um, I live in Maryland and there's a big deal going on right now because they're trying to ban all the clubs and all the bars from like they're trying to make it a smoke free environment --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but there's a huge um controversy going on.
L:  Yeah.  I live in Boston and they just d- like a month ago maybe --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or like two months ago and they banned it.  I haven't really been to any of the bars or anything, so it hasn't affected me too much yet.
R:  Oh, I see.  Are -- are you a smoker?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, you are.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, are you?
R:  No, I'm not.
L:  No?
R:  No. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Actually, this is funny because I've been trying to um make my boyfriend quit smoking for a long time now --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I know it -- like I know how hard it is --
L:  Yeah, it's a pain [LAUGH].
R:  -- but [LAUGH] -- have you ever tried -- 
L:  It's so gross.
R:  -- to quit smoking?
L:  Yeah, like I've quit and I started again and then I quit and started again like --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- on and off.
R:  I know how it goes.
L:  Hoping it's just a phase and that it'll die out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  But -- but I think it is necessary all the um products that are coming out.  I don't know how much they help because I don't know anybody who has been -- or has used it.
L:  What, like the patch and the gum and all that stuff?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, my Mom's been a hard core smoker for a really long time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and like she's tried all that stuff but she always ends up going back to smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like she even got hypnotized to quit and everything.  But it didn't work.
R:  Does she still smoke?
L:  Yeah, she still smokes.
R:  I see.
L:  Really, I think that it's good that they banned it in bars and clubs and stuff just because even though I do smoke, I think it's gross, I come home from a bar, just like reeking of cigarettes --
R:  I know.
L:  -- like the next day, like you smell your clothes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you're like oooh.
R:  I know, it's in your hair, it's in everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Plus secondhand smoking is even worse than firsthand smoking.
L:  Right.  It's not fair to do it to other people --
R:  Yeah.  I don't think --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- it is.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  And like I mean it's not that hard to go outside and smoke a cigarette.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, but the other thing that they're talking about now is um if they ban all the smokers from the clubs then, you know, they're going to automatically raise the prices of the products that they sell so they can, you know, get more -- they can compensate all the money that they lose from the smokers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what they're saying.
L:  And that kinda sucks.
R:  But I don't know, I'm willing to pay like a dollar or more in a non smoking area.  That's how I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- feel.
L:  Yeah, it's not a huge difference.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In the grand scheme --
R:  Hopefully not.
L:  -- of things [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Um, what else were we supposed to talk about?
L:  Like if -- if they -- if you think that like programs should be implemented to help people quit smoking, something like that?
R:  Mm.  Well, I'm not a smoker, so it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from a perspective that I have not experienced smoking.  I don't think it's necessary because I think it's all in like in your mind.  If you're really determined to quit smoking then, you know, you will.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you're really weak and if you're not ready to quit smoking then no matter what you're do, you're going to keep coming back.
L:  Yeah, I totally agree, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't think any measure is going to make somebody think, "Oh, I shouldn't smoke" [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I think people obviously know that there's like health risks involved in smoking and like you know --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- they know like bad things are going to happen to them but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like they start anyway and --
R:  Yeah.  Like my Grandpa, he smoked like all his life and he's like in his um seventies now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but he quit smoking a couple of days ago, I mean a couple of years ago.  And it --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- yeah, it's worked ever since because I think he just felt like he, you know, he would stop smoking because like his grandchildren are always around --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so he just like saw the necessity to quit smoking and he did.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  And he says it's not as hard as, you know, everybody says it is.  So --
L:  Yeah.  It's just a matter of like -- like psychologically, like preparing yourself and being like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not going to smoke anymore.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And not doing it.
R:  Definitely.  Definitely.  [LAUGH] Have you tried to quit smoking?
L:  Yeah, I mean like it's -- it's not even like that I feel like I need the nicotine or anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I don't really feel any effects of that --
R:  Yeah?
L:  It's just -- I mean, it's the physical like actually having a cigarette in your hand and like --
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's like a habit.
L:  Yeah.  Like an oral fixation, or like a manual fixation, it's kind of like, ooh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  So --
R:  My boyfriend says like he has to smoke when he's under a lot of stress --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he says it helps.  I don't know.  Like I'm -- I don't understand why.
L:  Yeah, I mean it -- it kind of calms me down a little bit --
R:  Mhm.  It does.
L:  -- like -- yeah.  It's like I don't know if it's the same thing for everyone, like if I have like a cigarette, I feel the same way if I had like a beer or two.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm just kind of like, ooh, like a little bit of a buzz for a few minutes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's nice, like, kind of relaxing.
R:  I see.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know, I've been trying to understand it for a long time but like, "Why can't you just quit?" because like he tells me, he promises me every time, he's like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "Okay, this is the last cigarette" and he even gave me like a whole pack of cigarettes that he'd bought, he's like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Okay, this is how I -- serious I am this time" --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and he just like goes back smoking and I'm like, "I don't understand you".
L:  Does he smoke a lot, or ...?
R:  He doesn't smoke a lot, he -- it's -- it's not a lot, but he just keeps going back.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He smokes like one cigarette maybe like a week or something.
L:  Well, that's not too bad.
R:  But -- yeah, that's not too bad, but he just can't stop, you know, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I told him, "If you're going to sm- smoke one cigarette like what difference does it make?" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't smoke that much anyways.  So, I can just forget about one cigarette and he's like, "Well, it's not as easy as it" you know.  Whatever.  He says that I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he says I don't understand because I don't know smoking but --
L:  [LAUGH] Did he used to smoke more and just cut down a lot?
R:  Yeah, he used to smoke a lot.  He used to smoke a lot, so he toned down a lot.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  And I'm proud of him for that, but [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe I should just give him a little time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe he's phasing it out slowly.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  And he'll get over it soon.
R:  Yeah.  Also my Dad, my Dad is um going through the same problem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  And my Mom hates smoking totally.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  But [LIPSMACK] oh well.  I'm not going to say anything [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] My Dad hates my -- the fact that my Mom smokes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she like -- she tried to hide it from him for the longest time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she thought she was really good at it and she was horrible.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She'd like go outside and smoke a cigarette and like rub herself off with [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, it doesn't work.
L:  I mean, you can't mask the h- --
R:  I know, it doesn't work.  Does not.
L:  I'm like, [inaudible] if you put five pieces of gum in your mouth, he's gonna know you were smoking.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Dumb, it's funny.
R:  [LAUGH] It is funny.  But mm.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, um, have you used any of the patch or anything?
L:  No, I mean like I just started smoking --
R:  You haven't?
L:  -- like a couple of months ago --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so I'm not like -- 
R:  Totally addicted.
L:  -- I just feel like if it becomes a serious problem I'll be able to just stop and like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not worry about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm trying to cut down now, and I'm just going to like try and just smoke socially.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then completely cut it out, but I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't like making promises to myself then not keeping them.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, I'm just like, oh.
R:  I -- I see, yeah.  I see what you're saying.  I was just wondering, you know, if you had tried any.  I was wondering what's the most effective way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like patch or um, what other ways --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- are there?
L:  There's the gum.
R:  Oh yeah, there is.
L:  Yeah, but I think -- I would think the patch would be more effective because like my Mom when she was on the patch, she would try to smoke a cigarette with the patch on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it would make her physically ill.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because there's so much nicotine going into your system --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you're just like ooh.  Whereas like with the gum you spit it out and then you smoke and you're fine.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, I never understood how they worked.  But, that's cool.  Aren't the patches really expensive, though?
L:  Yeah.  So is the gum.  I think it's like thirty or forty dollars.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  Yeah.  It's almost like, well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- smoking cigarettes costs less than that --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- so why not just smoke?
R:  Yeah.  That's another reason.
L:  Yeah.  But smoking gets expensive, too, if you smoke a lot.
R:  Oh yeah.  Definitely.  I know people who buy in a bo- you know, the whole box.
L:  A carton and stuff.
R:  Yeah, the cartons.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they can save money and it's like, "Why don't you just quit smoking, you'd save a whole lot" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're like, "Well, that's not one of the options, is it?" --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I say, "Yeah, it is".
L:  Yeah mhm.
R:  You have a lot of ah friends who smoke?
L:  Um, in Boston, no.  But at home, like where I'm originally from in New York, like all of my friends are chain smokers, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- crazy.
R:  Oh, you're from New York --
L:  So --
R:  -- do you go to school in Boston, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I'm living in Boston for the summer.
R:  Oh.  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Do you go to school
