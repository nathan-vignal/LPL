R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  This is Fonda in Fama[?], West Virginia.
R:  Hi, I'm Cindy in um Mt. Pleasant, Texas.
L:  Oh, my.  You're -- you're in a hot area [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  A very hot.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I'm a retired school teacher so ah you know um [LIPSMACK] setting up censorship on what children read is -- is a topic that I'm interested in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But um as um as a teacher I know that ah we're there to help children ah mold their character and so I've always been real big on character building and so to me we need books ah in those elementary schools and junior -- I'm a middle school teacher --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- particularly that will help them to be successful and practice --
R:  Right.
L:  -- practice democratic um principles --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so to me ah books that ah tear down that kind of ah character building um, you know, I think we -- we need to save those for those high school and college students after their character's already been formed.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] So, ah, you know, ah, there's just some books that I think that are later -- to be read later, not -- not real early in life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but um --
R:  I -- I -- I agree that certain books should be kept out of the public school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but ah I -- I don't think it should be left up just to a handful of people, say like a school board, or the school administration, to make that decision, I think that the parents should have some kind of input, you know, ah --
L:  Oh, I -- I totally agree, matter of fact --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I think that all schools -- and our school did -- have an advisory board --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah and it consisted of not only, you know, a teacher, faculty member, but a student, you know, of that school --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, the principal naturally, the guidance counselor, ah the librarian, ah members of the community --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a parents, um, you know, of students at that school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, oh yes, I don't think it should be in the -- left in the hands of a small just elite group of people that think, you know, this is good for our kids, or not good for our kids --
R:  Right.
L:  -- mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.  But ah I think that sometimes when um we -- we need there to have as wide a selection of books, you know, for children to read as possible because their interest is so varied --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  But ah I -- I remember years ago in the um, you know, some of the language in some of the books that were being put into elementary of middle school was just, you know, it -- it did not meet the community standards --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and ah so therefore to me, you know, censorship should -- should work um on a community basis, not on a nationwide --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, what -- you know, but still I um I would really lead my children to -- to read really wholesome books that really ah built them up and made them more successful than tear them down.
R:  Yeah.  I w- I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to a nationwide thing um I guess e- like they're doing with music now where they have ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- an advisory label on it.
L:  I like that idea --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  I hadn't thought about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.  You know, just like on records, have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a warning or have a rating like on movies, in videos, on records --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah on -- on -- ah, you know, what the music and also now, yes, on books.  But you know, um, I do have some friends who are librarians and they really do ah you know, select some really good books for the kids to read that are really interesting and really, you know, fun to read and the p- t- ah -- ah appropriate age levels.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that's important, too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is that the books in -- in our school library, for example, fit the age level of the reader --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and that alone will help to ah control some books that would be not appropriate.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  Or acceptable.  And then, it -- to me it boils down to parents.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, they're just starting --
R:  That -- that's a big --
L:  -- books
R:  -- part of it.
L:  Yes.  I mean, I don't know, do you have children?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  I don't either.  And -- but I'm telling you, that there was just certain books that I -- that I would not permit my children to read in our household --
R:  Right.
L:  -- simply because it -- I mean if I don't go around cursing, I all the time, and swearing all the time, why should I have books in the my -- you know, that my student brings home from the library that is full of that?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.  So, I think it begins really with the parent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- but I still think we teachers have a great role in ah helping parents to ah shape the character that these children are going to have as adults.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And um and we need to cooperate with the parents in selecting appropriate reading material.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well and, you know, parents, I think, just need to be more involved in -- and educate themselves --
L:  Absolutely.  Mhm.
R:  -- um ...  Ah, I don't have children myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but my brother has five --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and um you know at -- at any given time I can ask him, "Well, what are the girls doing in school?" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he doesn't have a clue [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, see, yeah, and --
R:  You know?
L:  -- you're right.  Now, he -- he needs to know, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or, for example, they're talking about the history books right now, but that the revisionists have gone in and revised the history to the point where ah you wouldn't even think ah who founded our country believed in you know that you know in Christian values or something --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and here, you know, ah, the founding of our country was based upon the ten commandments --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah -- ah but, you know, there -- th- -- now they're -- they're censoring that out of the history books, they're censoring, you know, the fact that George Washington prayed um and -- and that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, certain of our leaders of the finer d- of the ah the ah of the constitution are -- were the -- certain values that they thought was important --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are being revised out of the history books.  So, I really think that we need to get back to ah sanity where we -- the truth is the truth that here's who settled our country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they came over here with these beliefs and certain rights and -- and privileges and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and now we're trying to say that the -- the basis of our whole country was that -- I mean, it's not in the books anymore.
R:  Yeah.  I hadn't heard that.
L:  Ah, yes, we're just now -- we're just now learning about that through some of our, you know, listening to the talk programs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um that ah -- that the books are being -- ah now a group of parents and leaders are saying, "Look, we're going to insist that ah history books start -- ah stop censoring ah how this country was truly founded --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- and who founded it and what did they believe --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- why did they come over here?" um and a- and it's not in our books.
R:  That's -- that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- unfortunate.  Very unfortunate.
L:  Mhm.  It is.  It's alarming.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, what is it, if you for- if you censor ah out how -- where you came from and how you got here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, ah then what, you know, you d- you're losing your foundation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of your citizenship or the foundation upon which your citizenship is based and ...  [SIGH] Yeah, I ah [SIGH] um I -- I was in a -- involved in a um a school -- school board debate over um teaching evolution and creation theory --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in our -- in our county, Canola county, er, West Virginia and um and ah our parents rebelled, a group of them rebelled to the point where you could not cross their line without you know, being in danger --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah because they insisted that ah the creation theory be taught along with the evolution theory and I was already doing it anyway in -- in my science classes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because as a teacher I didn't want to be censored, you know, my academic freedom, I thought --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah meant that I -- I had to just teach the evolution theory and a theory is a theory --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, you know, let's -- let's include all the theories --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ah -- and then -- then as they get older they can ah decide, you know, what they want to believe.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was going to say something I just totally lost it [LAUGH].
L:  Well, the um -- well Texas has been a big state and -- and ah -- and ah textbook ah you know overseeing and watching what's been put in textbooks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and sometimes um they kept some things that are not right.  And sometimes they, you know, um, you know, do -- do um get some of the ah textbooks changed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because the information in them is not ah -- is -- is one sided --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- instead of, you know, but no, I -- I love books and I can't, you know, I -- I cannot hardly -- I can hardly allow myself to, you know, discard a book, even if it's one that I don't want to read, I'll just put it in a yard sale and pass it on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to somebody who wants to read it.  Yeah.  Because there -- all of us have such different reading styles and reading d- eh -- likes and dislikes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- but I do agree that you know er we should monitor and censor what -- what the school children are -- are being able to
