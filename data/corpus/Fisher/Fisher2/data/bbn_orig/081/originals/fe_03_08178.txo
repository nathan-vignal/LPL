R:  Neither have I -- 
L:  -- taken one of these surveys.

L:  Um --
R:  Dunno [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know.  
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  I don't know, I'm not good at this, so --
R:  [several inaudible words] like, "Oh, yeah, that" [LAUGH].  But somehow, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you did this and this happened [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] No, uh, I've been married for thirty years, so --

R:  [NOISE] Huh?
L:  I don't know -- I know it's ten bucks, that's all [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that's [several inaudible words], I was like -- 'cause, uh --
L:  I said, "I know this call is worth ten dollars", that's all I know.
R:  One of my friends did it, and he, you know, had a, um, thing, and he told me to put in my PIN, and he was like, "Oh, why don't you call in, and open, you know, get one?"  So I thought, "Oh, yeah, okay" [inaudible].  So, I called in and they gave me my little thing and -- to call this number and -- I guess you would of talked to them for [NOISE], what, ten minutes or whatever.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.  Like, do they let you know when your ten minutes are up?

L:  I don't know, but I think this is gonna be a long ten minutes.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they said they get to pick the topic, so [NOISE] --
R:  I guess if you start talking about something else you don't get ten dollars then, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I guess.  I -- but I -- I really don't know.  [several inaudible words] to talk about --

[NOISE] [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I couldn't make it.  I really wanted to make it, but I couldn't take off, because, you know, I'm [MN] -- I'm working and then I -- there was nobody for me to take off, 'cause every [several inaudible words] working in our, you know, our shift but they had already taken off, so -- and I'm like, you know, they had seniority that takes off first, so then there was, you know, I was down the line [LIPSMACK] [NOISE].
