R:  Sharon.
L:  Hi, it's Saffy.
R:  Hi Saffy.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Good.  I haven't done this in a while [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] This is like my second call, so --
L:  Oh yeah, me too.  Second or third, I think.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  So, it was fam- has ah the divorce affected our opinion of marriage?  Is that what it basically says?
R:  Right.  I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or maybe our behavior, that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you married?
L:  No.  Are you?
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Well, that's [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I'm not married and [SIGH] mm, I really haven't paid attention to the divorce rate.  I think that people are just rushing into marriage more these days --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not getting to know their partner.
R:  I think it's just that it's so easy to get a divorce --
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  -- and that's kind of why it's increased.
L:  That's true too.
R:  But like I know that I'm catholic and the catholic church --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- has kind of become more active in marriage preparation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- prior to --
L:  Really?
R:  -- letting people get married so that they're kind of -- they're listening --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to the fact that divorce rate is climbing and they don't want um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they want to make sure people know what they're getting into --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which is good.
L:  That's good.
R:  I know when I was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- engaged --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it, I don't know, like I wasn't worried, I knew I had found the right guy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I had came from, you know, parents that weren't divorced --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it wasn't an issue for me --
L:  Mhm.  Well, yeah, I come from yeah [LAUGH] I come from --
R:  The same thing?
L:  -- a divorce -- ah --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  -- separate, all that, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't really think that's affected me that I can see, you know --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- like, I still believe in marriage and love and all, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- I'm not bitter or anything.
R:  Right.  You don't think, oh, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Good.
L:  It's -- I still think that um you just got to take your time.  Like when I hear people two years and they're married or, you know, right out of high school, I just -- I don't see how that's possible because I've been with my boyfriend for like six years and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I'm still learning stuff [LAUGH].
R:  You don't want to get married?
L:  No, I do.
R:  You do?
L:  I'm just saying, I still -- I'm still learning stuff --
R:  You -- right.
L:  -- like I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, I'm not in a rush because that should be a lifetime commitment, I agree.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And people -- I just -- I think people just take it lightly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, well, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  It's funny because my sister just got married last weekend --
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  -- on July fourth --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and um it's her second marriage --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and yeah, I guess I never thought she would be divorced --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but --
L:  You never know sometimes.
R:  -- it was more, you know, it wasn't -- didn't -- it shocked me at first --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but now it's kinda like, well, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she -- she -- you know, so maybe I'm more accepting.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  Where --
L:  -- that happens --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, some people just change [LAUGH].
R:  I think, yeah, and I think it has become [MN] become more accepted and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and not as --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- you know, like forbidden --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as it was before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean even the catholic church you -- the -- they're um -- they have groups for divorced couples --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  -- and they've, you know, been able to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get an annulment much easier than it was before, so --
L:  Can you hold on one second, I'm sorry?
R:  Yeah, go ahead.
L:  [NOISE] I'm working it right there [NOISE] you're welcome.  Hello?
R:  Are you working?
L:  I'm sorry.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're so bad.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, my gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] That's hilarious, isn't it?  Usually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would be on break, but yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, um, what's I going to say?  Yeah, my aunt actually is getting married for the second time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she's um, you know, religious and all that, but it's like [SIGH] what can you do?  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so, did the f- what was the family's reaction to it?
L:  Hm.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Where they kind of like --
L:  Yeah, nobody was worried [LAUGH].
R:  Nobody said anything?  Yeah.
L:  I mean, she's um, let's see, it's four girls that my grandmother had and only one is still with their husband, basically --
R:  Wow.  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  So --
R:  Yeah.  My um, well, my Mom was an only child and my Dad's brother's divorced --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, yeah, it's -- I mean, I think it's really common --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I don't know that it's affected my behavior, but I guess, you know, I have kids and they ask --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "Are you going to get d-" you know, when they hear Tim and I argue, they think --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.
R:  -- "Are you guys getting divorced?" --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and we -- we go through that whole conversation.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  And my little girl has actually said, "Well, Mommy, you can help me pick -- pick the right one because I might not know what the right one's like" so --
L:  [LAUGH] That's cute.
R:  -- I mean, we've had those conversations, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's like, "Oh gosh" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Picking the right one.  Yes, she doesn't want to be divorced, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.  There's --
L:  Yeah.  It's gotta be hard, I mean I just couldn't imagine, especially if it was, you know, not mutual.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  That would be weird.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Definitely.  But ah, yeah, I don't -- I don't even -- haven't paid attention to the rate, but I do know that it has increased --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- definitely.
R:  But I think, yeah, I think you're right.  People are getting married too quickly and --
L:  Yeah.  And not getting to know the people --
R:  -- and then they're giving up too quickly.
L:  Yeah, that true, that too.
R:  I think, you know --
L:  Counselling and stuff like that, not looking into that.
R:  -- they just think, "Well, this must not have been it--"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- and I'll just try again" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think, "No, it's, you know, you shouldn't have gone into it like that" --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you -- you need to work on it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- it's a forever commitment --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if you were serious about that, then you should have -- then you should --
L:  Thought about it more [LAUGH].
R:  -- at least -- well, you should at least give it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, a try.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Defini- --
R:  So, are you -- you guys aren't planning on --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We speak about it, but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- money situation and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- everything, so, you know, want to do it the right way.
R:  I know.
L:  So --
R:  We did the same thing.
L:  And I'm still young, so [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  I've got time.
R:  But at least you found the right guy.
L:  Huh?
R:  At least you found the right guy.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, that's good.
L:  I'm happy about it.
R:  Yeah.  Where do you live?  Do you live in a city or ...?
L:  I live in Long Island.
R:  Long Island?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's no rush, just ah graduated last year, in May --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Getting the whole work thing down pat and all that [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.

R:  No, college [LAUGH] I should say.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] College.
R:  Good for you.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And did you -- did you get a job right out of college, or are you still --
L:  Yeah, actually, um --
R:  -- looking for it, what you want?
L:  I actually found it, um, like they have a on campus recruiting --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, I found it through that.  And then I had it, but I didn't start till October.
R:  Good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I was lucky.
R:  I was an English major and it um took a while to find a job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I was actually --
L:  Yeah, that's a hard major.
R:  -- it was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was actually going to go to law school, but then I was so exhausted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I graduated --
L:  You'd say, Oh --
R:  -- I said, "I am not going to law school" --
L:  I know exactly how you feel because I have to try to get my masters now and I'm like, "Oh" --
R:  Yeah.  It's like, "No more" --
L:  [SIGH] Enough.
R:  -- "No more loans, --"
L:  Exactly.
R:  "-- no more.  I'm done."
L:  Yeah.  And definitely don't have the loan, so [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a bit much.
R:  It is a lot.
L:  Yeah.  Schooling.
R:  We put my husband through and he took like two classes a semester.  It took him five years to get his masters.
L:  Oh.  That's --
R:  We thought that it would never come.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's --
R:  So, maybe it is easier --
L:  -- when you've got to do it part time, it's hard.
R:  Yeah, it is hard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It feels like forever.
L:  Yeah.  Well, [SIGH] --
