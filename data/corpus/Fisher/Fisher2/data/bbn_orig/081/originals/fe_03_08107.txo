R:  Hello?
L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Samantha.
R:  Hi.  I'm Shannon.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Um, from North Carolina.  How about you?
L:  Dallas, Texas.
R:  Cool.
L:  So, what hobbies do you like?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, I play guitar a lot and, ah, I do a lotta drawing and painting and I ride my bike. [LAUGH] How about you?
L:  Um, I'm more into things like sewing.  I do a lotta cross stitch and knitting and making clothes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, I like to do decoupaging and, ah, painting on bisqueware.
R:  Nice.
L:  So --
R:  I've never done decoupage but I always thought it looked fun.  I also -- yeah, I sew a lot too and knit.  I just learned how to knit last -- last winter and, um, I just started making quilts too.  So ...
L:  That's something I have to learn.  I -- I wanna try a small little pillow first to try and get a [LAUGH] technique right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I made a, um -- I made a baby quilt for a friend for, um, [LIPSMACK] when her baby was born and it took me, like, [LAUGH] four months to do [LAUGH] and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I can- -- and I didn't even quilt the whole thing -- I just quilted the edges.  But it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was really fun but it took a long time. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I bought a, um -- one of my cross stitch patterns, um, through a catalogue and they didn't tell you the size of it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, that was the biggest mistake. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?
L:  'Cause, ah, three years down the line I'm still busy with it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That takes a lotta time.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It's fun to have something though.  The thing I like best about knitting is that it's something that you can, like, just pick up a- -- to keep your hands busy while you're doing other stuff.
L:  Yeah.  You can watch TV or --
R:  I- --
L:  -- have a conversation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and still knit and ...  It's at least -- some of the times you can get stuff that's at least small enough that you can take around with you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in case you're stuck in a long queue or ...
R:  Yeah.  For sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what was that -- oh, and then they asked how much time do you usually spend on your hobbies?  How about you?
L:  Hm ... I pr- -- I tr- -- I aim [LAUGH] to try and do an hour a day but that never happens. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it just depends on how busy I am but probably ... ah, I don't know ... maybe a couple of hours a week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you?
R:  Um, I actually spend quite a bit of time.  I'm pretty lucky 'cause I, um -- I'm a nanny and the little girl --
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  Yeah.  The little girl's five and she's pretty independent.  She doesn't really want me [LAUGH] to play with her a whole lot. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I -- actually, when I go to work I usually take something with me.  Either, like, my sketchbook or my knitting or whatever it is I'm working on.  So, I usually get to work on it a few hours a day just while --
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  -- while I'm getting paid too. [LAUGH] So --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's, kinda, nice.  Yeah.  And my other stuff, I usually -- you know, I bike a lot and I play guitar, y- you know, three or four times a week.  I -- I guess I spend a lot of time [LAUGH] on my hobbies. [LAUGH] I figure the --
L:  You're lucky though.
R:  Sorry?  What were you gonna say?
L:  I said you're lucky --
R:  Yeah.  I f- --
L:  -- that you've got that time for it.
R:  I figure that if you don't have time to do the things you enjoy then there's, you know -- you should rearrange your life a little bit. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I know that -- I'm also lucky 'cause I don't have -- like, I'm not -- I don't have kids of my own or anything yet so --
L:  Yeah.  Nor do I.  But, um, I -- I try -- every now and then, on my lunch hours I'll hide in my car or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- somewhere where no one can interrupt me and I'll -- to spend[?] on my hobbies and it's at least -- it's relaxing.  It gets you away from everything.
R:  Yeah.  For sure.  Um, what was the other question they asked?  Should everyone --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- have a hobby or something like that?  What was it?
L:  Yeah.  H- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think that was it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, virtually everyone I've met has.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, and I think, you know, whether it be a sporting hobby or a -- some other form of hobby, I think everybody's got something to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- break away.  But ...
R:  Yeah.  I, kinda, come from the -- the line of thinking that -- that your worth doesn't make you who you are.  I know that, like, in our -- in our country especially, like, when -- when you ask somebody what they do they usually -- the first thing they answer is whatever it is they do to make money.
L:  Yes.
R:  But -- but most of us -- I -- I know, for me, like, and most of my friends, that's not what they -- like, if they stopped getting paid that's not what they'd keep doing, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, it seems like -- it seems like that if -- if everybody's doing stuff outside of their employment that they enjoy that seems like a more worthwhile way to spend their time.  I know that I --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- try [COUGH] -- I try really hard not to, like, watch too much TV or anything so I can do other stuff that I enjoy.
L:  Yeah.  I don't watch a lotta TV.  Um, I watch, like, a couple of my favorite programs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's not many of those.  Um, I don't have cable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't wanna spend the money on it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah, I think that's definitely helped out on that field.  But, um ... [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.  We, um -- we have a TV in our house but it -- we don't have an antenna, which is a good thing [LAUGH] 'cause it means that we don't get really any stations.  So, mostly, people just use it for a -- for watching movies and stuff.  So, it's good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I -- I get sucked into it if it's around, you know?  It's really easy to just -- when you come home from a long day work just to veg out in front of the TV instead of doing other productive stuff.
L:  That's for sure.  I know when I first moved to the -- to the United States, we didn't have a TV for, like, three months.
R:  Wow.  Where did --
L:  And it was great.
R:  -- you move from?
L:  South Africa.
R:  From South Africa?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  That's neat.  How long have you been here?
L:  Ah, just past two years now.
R:  Wow.  That's neat.
L:  So ... yeah.  It's been -- it's been an adventure.  It's been pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Um --
R:  -- did you do all that same stuff when you were in South Africa?  That --
L:  Yeah.  My --
R:  T- --
L:  -- mother in law got me into it -- into most of it and, um, I remember trying, like, some cross stitch when I was really young.  My mom said to me, "Oh, it'll be too difficult for ya".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I tried for about five minutes, put it down, picked it up a couple of years later [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, it turns out that my mother in law was a- -- into all the cross stitch and most of the crafting hobbies and her and I just a la- -- on like a house on fire because of it.
R:  [LAUGH] Does --
L:  And, um, she comes out here every now and then and we'll go to Michael's and Hobby Lobby and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the little craft places and ...  You get some pretty interesting stuff out here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  More variety.
R:  Yeah.  I just, ah -- we just went t- -- actually today to -- do you all have Joann Fabrics down there in Texas?
L:  Yes, we do.
R:  Yeah.  So, we just -- we went there today and I'm always so overwhelmed 'cause there's always so many d- -- projects I wanna start. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I k- -- I never wanna take on too many at once 'cause then they'll all sit there half done, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  That's what I'm like. [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  But, um, I'll go down to Joann's or, um, like, Hancock Fabrics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that and -- the fabrics that have in are so pretty.  I'll always --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- find something that I want.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  I'll get two or three yards of that 'cause I can make a pair of pants or a skirt or something and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I'm always -- every -- every season when they get new fabrics in I'm always really tempted to buy stuff but I just -- we actually don't have a working sewing machine right now so it makes it harder.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Mine's a real old sewing machine.  It -- I don't even have an over locker.
R:  Wow.
L:  We got given it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I just zigzag on the edges and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pray and hope. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That it stays?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would love an over locker machine.  Those things are expensive though.
L:  Yeah.  My, um -- my mother in law bought herself a -- when she was out here a couple of years ago a Husqvarna --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- embroidery machine.
R:  Oh, I love those.
L:  And she brought that back and I -- I -- I was flabbergasted. [LAUGH] And she -- she was doing all sorts of stuff and nowadays we'll get a gift from her every now and then and it's either tea towels or a set of bath towels or something with your initials or a picture.  She's -- she's used it a lot but --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's a lotta money. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I love those things.  Yeah.  I saw one and it -- it c- comes with, like, a thousand different designs or something like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the one I was looking at.  But they're so expensive.
L:  They are.  And you've still gotta buy the cards.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  The disks.  Yeah.
R:  So, that's separate?  Yeah.  So, yeah, when I -- like, when I made the quilt our sewing machine had just broken so I did the whole thing by hand, which, I guess, is why it took so long.  But, you know, it was, like, a whole -- it's a whole different, kinda, thing 'cause when you're sewing on a machine it -- it goes so much faster.  It's nearly as, like --
L:  It does.
R:  -- meditative, you know? [LAUGH] But --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  When you sew by hand it's, kinda, this relaxing process, which -- but I -- I do miss having a machine 'cause since we -- since the machine broke I haven't made any clothes or anything 'cause it just takes way too long. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  I -- I wouldn't have the patience.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, I -- I found a pattern for some elasticated, ah, slacks and I started making a -- I'm a size eight --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in European sizes and, um, so I cut the pattern for it and I must've taken about two inches off of each leg --
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- so far 'cause it's just way too big.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it says -- it says it's a small.
R:  Huh.
L:  I was, like, "I'm not using these patterns again". [LAUGH]
R:  That's interesting.
L:  So, I just -- I keep sewing and trying it on again, it doesn't --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- fit --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sew some more ... [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  Do you have a dressmaker?  I mean, like, a -- you know, like, a dress form or do you just --
L:  No, not yet. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's on the list of things to get.
R:  [LAUGH] Those are expensive too unless you can find one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can sometimes find 'em at antique stores --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they're -- they're not as -- as nice as the new ones that have, like, the s- soft cushioning on them and stuff.
L:  There's a -- also, a couple of streets by us that do, ah, yard sales pretty often and I've been trying to keep my eye out in case I see w- --
