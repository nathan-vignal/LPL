L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  [SIGH] This is Thomas.
R:  Hi, I'm Sarah.
L:  Where are you calling from? [SIGH]
R:  New York.
L:  New York?  I'm in California.
R:  Oh, how's the sunshine going there?
L:  [SIGH]  It's great.  How is it there?
R:  It's great --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- hot, but that's --
L:  It's hot here too [SIGH].  This is my favorite part about it, is knowing who comes from where.  
R:  Yeah.  It's easy just, like, talk.
L:  Um, I have, yeah.  I've -- just started it, but I've taken a few calls here and there --
R:  Oh [inaudible] --
L:  [SIGH] Your first one?  [SIGH] Wow.  Did you hear the topic?  
R:  Family values.
L:  Family values, and talking about the divorce rate.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] Does that have an effect on --
R:  The --
L:  -- you?
R:  -- divorce rate?
L:  Yeah.  Does that affect as -- what you think family values are?  And does it [SIGH] change your thoughts on -- on what the roles of marriage and --
R:  Um, I think --
L:  -- what it means to you?
R:  -- that divorce is like -- it -- I mean, it is becoming more of an easy way out [SIGH].  Kind -- kind of like, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more people are giving up easier, because it's -- because of how easy it is to get a divorce.  I think that, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, it definitely, like, makes me look [inaudible] marriage, like, 'cause you're not, like, supposed to last and that's how you're brought up -- that you're brought up [several inaudible words] like, in our society.  It's definitely different.
L:  Yeah.  No, I would agree with you actually, [SIGH] thinking that it's an easy way out [MN] so to speak [SIGH] from dealing with it and trying to make it last as it's supposed to [SIGH], as to how we were brought up.
R:  I'm twenty.
L:  [MN] How old are you?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  You're twenty?  I'm twenty seven.
R:  Oh, you are?  
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Uh, no, I'm not.  
L:  Interesting.  
R:  Are you?
L:  Are you married?
R:  Um, and are you?
L:  Okay. 
R:  Live together, obviously.
L:  Yes, I am.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah [SIGH]. 
R:  Yeah.  I'm actually --
L:  Have you --
R:  -- a lot of my, um, parents' --
L:  -- had anybody that you know of get divorced?
R:  -- friends [NOISE].  Yes, I've noticed with the others --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going strong.
L:  Your parents are still together?
R:  Thankfully, but, um, no, I mean it's hard.  A lot of [inaudible] parents have gotten divorced.
L:  That's good.
R:  I mean, like, definitely -- I think that if, if both parties are unhappy --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and there's -- there's no better solution, then, I mean, in that way divorce is a good thing, you know, let them get on with their lives and move forward, but [SIGH] I think that, um, people definitely tend to -- to give up and lose all hope because it's available.
L:  [SIGH] I agree, I agree.  [MN] I've had many of my own personal friends go through divorce in the last [SIGH] two years, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my wife and I are very strong --
R:  How long have you been married?
L:  -- in our relationship because of that.  [SIGH] Seeing them go through that --
R:  Oh, I [several inaudible words]. 
L:  -- that's -- that's an interesting thought.
R:  I mean I -- I don't mean to say it like that, but [several inaudible words].
L:  Going on six years.
R:  Good for you [MN].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  No, really -- [MN] yeah -- you know, that's not what I'm saying, it's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- an accomplishment [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I agree [MN].  Yeah, no, I understand.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I hope so.
L:  That makes sense.
R:  'Cause I mean --
L:  That makes sense.
R:  -- if I meet the right person.
L:  Do you plan on getting married yourself?
R:  Yeah, definitely.  No, I mean, I definitely want --
L:  [SIGH] Well, uh, definitely -- obviously --
R:  -- to be married.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  It's something that I hope --
L:  -- will have definitely.
R:  -- will happen at some point.  No, a -- a little young, but -- who knows?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Uh, what do you think about --
L:  What do you think about [LIPSMACK] --
R:  -- family values?  Families, um --
L:  -- I don't know where else to go in the conversation then [MN].
R:  Do you have kids?  Do you have kids?  [MN] Do you mind, I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- me asking? [inaudible]  
L:  Yes, two. 
R:  Oh, [LIPSMACK] very cute.
L:  One is two years old --
R:  Um --
L:  -- going on three, and the other is three months old, yeah [SIGH].  I have a -- one of my [MN] -- couple of friends that divorced, they had a child after they divorced [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and now I know of another couple who's divorcing beforehand [SIGH] and I'd say I'm more happy that they're divorcing before they're having children --
R:  I definitely agree.  I think that it's really --
L:  -- compared to afterwards --
R:  -- really bad to, um --
L:  -- the relationship --
R:  -- to have [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- for the child is horrible now for the dad, because of that.
R:  -- yourself into account, but you also [inaudible] your children.  I [inaudible] who have divorced parents, [SIGH] especially bad divorces, you know, like, really cruel, um, it's very hard for them.  And it doesn't [several inaudible words] socially, and [several inaudible words], so I think that people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who, um, [LIPSMACK] who are having problems should definitely think before they go ahead and have children [MN].  Yeah.  I don't know what -- you know, what else to --
L:  Yeah, I agree [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's a good point.  
R:  What other -- what other kind of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- family values -- what -- what else does that mean?
L:  So, what else then?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Family values.
R:  Do you have a big family?
L:  [SIGH] Family values and divorce -- interesting.
R:  Me too.  If you think -- [MN] are you close with your family?
L:  [SIGH]  
R:  Oh, sorry.
L:  No, I come from a small family [SIGH].  Um, I'd like to --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- think I am, to my -- at least my mother and sister.  My father passed away [SIGH] many years ago, well [SIGH] --
R:  Was it a bad divorce --
L:  -- it was actually funny, 'cause you said your parents are still married and mine have been divorced since I was young [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, I don't remember --
R:  Well, see, in that way I think that divorce --
L:  -- anything of it, I just remember having the two different -- two separate parents.
R:  -- is a good thing, because it gives, you know, like you said, it [several inaudible words].
L:  [SIGH] I'm not -- I don't remember, I don't recall.  I don't think it was a good marriage by any means, so [SIGH] --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] like, how you don't have recollection of anything bad [inaudible], you just have two separate families, sort of.  [SIGH] I don't mean -- and that's how it should be, if it does occur.  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] um, do you think it's important to be close with your family?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, if it's gonna occur, then it should be that way.  Oh, I --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- definitely do.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I agree.
L:  -- that -- sets up so many different --
R:  Um, I have a -- I don't have a large family, I have a small family, but [several inaudible words].
L:  -- not only values, but systems and patterns that you should [MN] hopefully follow and then want to [SIGH] [several inaudible words] for what you've taken in yourself.
R:  -- very important.  I think it's, like, one of -- it's probably one [MN] -- one of my biggest priorities is to stay close and [SIGH] in contact with all my family members [SIGH], so I think -- yeah [LIPSMACK].  Um, I think about nineteen years.  Yeah, [MN] so, yeah, that's good.  
L:  That's good, that's good.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, family values.
L:  That's good.
R:  Hm.
L:  How long have your parents been married?
R:  [LIPSMACK] What else? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's great.  That is great.
R:  Um, like it -- [MN] meaning what?
L:  Well, do you think it's -- do you think it's -- [MN] coming from New York, do you think it's any different from what [SIGH] you would think on the West Coast would be?
R:  Well, I'm -- um, I don't really think so.  I mean, I think that maybe that --
L:  Well, in -- in regards to the possibilities of divorce --
R:  -- not -- not family values, but, like, values --
L:  -- and [SIGH] -- and the rates of divorce, compared to --
R:  -- in general, like --
L:  -- what may happen on the East Coast versus --
R:  -- the way people live.  I'll probably -- I mean, they differ everywhere.
L:  -- the West Coast.
R:  You know, like, because of culture and different influences.  But, I don't know, I mean, people could make generalizations, but I don't really see -- I mean, do you?  Coming from the West Coast?
L:  [SIGH] Uh, I can definitely see how -- as a society we would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- label, you know, West Coast versus --
R:  Like, I could see that.
L:  -- East Coast --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and think some people are so different [SIGH], and I would probably there may be more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- divorce --
R:  I was gonna say, I mean --
L:  -- on the West Coast here in California [SIGH] than there would be there on the East Coast or in New York specifically [SIGH].
R:  Uh-huh, yeah, I'm exactly the same making generalizations.  I mean, you could say that [SIGH], you know, in Hollywood --
L:  I mean, there's that Hollywood, come on --
R:  -- there's, like, all the money and fame and people marry for all the wrong reasons all the time.
L:  -- [SIGH] there's -- you see -- you picture that as a -- as a part of what you --
R:  And divorce is -- is like a no brainer thing that just [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- en- envision as California.
R:  -- but, I mean, [several inaudible words] California, so -- yeah.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  No, obviously not.  And there's probably more to -- more than [SIGH] I would think there would be on the East Coast.  I think more of the East Coast as more of the [SIGH] -- the family ground for --
R:  Yeah.  Are you originally from California?
L:  -- you know, people to be on the East Coast --
R:  Oh.  You like it there, obviously?
L:  -- and have family be close to their extended family and immediate family [SIGH] versus here in California, you're going out on your own, you know?  You go to the West Coast and be on your own, so to speak [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible] I'm in New York City, so it's --
L:  Yeah, I am.
R:  -- crazy as well.  Yeah.
L:  I -- I do and I don't [SIGH].  Um, there's -- there's so many things that are happening here all the time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's a crazy place to be [SIGH].  Crazy place to be.
R:  I don't think I wanna live there.  I would think that California life's a bummer. 
L:  I would probably agree, yeah.
R:  I've been to Los Angeles, and it was -- it was definitely crazy and --
L:  But -- but it's such a -- I would think that would be such a different --
R:  -- it's a different kind of [SIGH] --
L:  -- situation.  I mean, I'm certain we've got the --
R:  -- but if you're very, uh --
L:  -- craziness of both places.  
R:  [several inaudible words] I mean, it's hard to explain.
L:  I don't think yours would be a lot more, compared to what I'm used to here in California.  
R:  Yeah [LIPSMACK], so, um, family values -- what else does that mean?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I have no, like, divorce in my family, my immediate family.  Uh, my uncle and -- and his wife are divorced.
L:  Family values.  Do you think if you were to come from --
R:  But, um, in my immediate one I have no divorce.
L:  -- a large family versus a small family --
R:  So, I [inaudible] that, I mean --
L:  -- that makes a difference as to whether --
R:  -- I definitely see my parents go through pat- -- rough patches -- 
L:  -- or not you may or may not get divorced?
R:  -- you know, like, to the point where they could have easily given up on it, 'cause, like, that would be the end, but, like, I -- I've watched that, like, we'll go through it and -- and get on with it and be better off because of that.
L:  [SIGH]
