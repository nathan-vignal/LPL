R:  Hi, my name is Sharon.
L:  Hi, this is Sunny. [PAUSE] Hello?
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry, this is my first call [LAUGH].
L:  Um, mine too.
R:  Oh.
L:  Okay.  So, terrorism.  Um, do you think you would stay calm during --
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I think now, after nine eleven, I think I would really panic because knowing the magnitude of what can happen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think most people would panic.
L:  Are you -- do you live in the New York area?
R:  No, no, I --
L:  I s- -- I do, and --
R:  Do you?  Wow.
L:  Uh-huh and I actually work right next to where nine eleven happened --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- the World Trade Center.  But it was funny because I was actually -- I work the night shift and I -- I was home when it happened --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'd only like, probably like two hours I -- after I left work it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's when it happened.
R:  God.
L:  But um I was --
R:  Did you panic, being at home?
L:  No, that's the thing.  I actually felt --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- very removed about it.
R:  Wow.  Wow.
L:  I wasn't really -- I -- there was like -- there was some anxiety when I heard that the Pentagon had been attacked --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I thought it was the beginning of possibly ah a real war.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But after I realized that it was a renegade terrorist attack it was -- it was just all felt very kind of distant and removed and it didn't seem real.
R:  But when you went back to work, wasn't it kind of --
L:  Well, actually, I didn't go back to work --
R:  Oh, you didn't?
L:  -- for a while because the office had shut down --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- because the buildings had gone down.  But eve- I mean like my roommates reacted differently.  One of my roommates panicked and, you know, ran off to Boston and did her reports of like bombs being found on bridges and tunnels.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But um I -- I was very skeptical about that, I didn't feel like the chance of another attack so soon after this major one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was very good.  So, in a way like I -- I didn't feel really kind of flipped up and that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I guess it would depend on what form the terrorist attack had taken.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Like i- if you I -- I think anyone would panic if you'd heard that it was a nuclear --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- in -- in that way you just --
R:  There's nowhere to, I mean, you don't know what to do at that point.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I think a lot of it has to do with -- I have children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so my --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Of course.
R:  I think that plays into it, whether you're single or whether you're you know --
L:  Yeah, I definitely -- I can definitely empathize with that, even though I don't have children --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I can see like how having dependents would just make you feel a lot more vulnerable --
R:  Oh yeah, because you're just --
L:  -- because --
R:  -- so vulnerable at that point, you're not as mobile, you can't just you know, I did go and -- and pick them up from school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- my husband was in New Jersey at the time, um, on Long Island --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I couldn't get in touch with him and I just went and I picked up the kids because I wanted them close to me, you know, in case something happened and certainly --
L:  Yeah.  And -- and this may sound silly, but I felt somewhat similar, not because I've kids, but I've cats --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and I was thinking, "God, if -- if a war does happen" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know "And we have to evacuate, what would I do with my cats?"
R:  Mhm.  Exactly.  That's the first thing you think of is, "Okay, you know, what about the people around me, what about my pets, what about?" --
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I've actually heard of friends of friends who ran out -- who were actually living in [inaudible] and since the building went down everyone was just running in mass panic and there was one woman who ha- who had just had, you know, adopted a little puppy --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, she was running with a puppy in her arms, basically --
R:  Oh, god.
L:  -- you know?  So --
R:  Seeing the whole thing on TV, you know, I think made it even worse because, you know, you see everyone panicking and you're like, "Oh, my god, how horrific it was" --
L:  Yeah, I see -- if I had been there, if I had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- been near the site when the building went down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that whole -- the thing that you never could have visualized or expected happen --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- then I would have definitely been -- I mean I -- I've seen those people's faces like in those scenes --
R:  Right, that's what I keep --
L:  -- when they were running.
R:  -- envisioning, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Now, I -- I think it was different because I wasn't there and I'd been asleep when it happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, by the time I woke up it had already happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there was just the remnants of it, you know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  But the whole plane thing, now --
L:  That was amazing.  Have you seen that footage of like a news reporter at the firehouse?
R:  No.
L:  Um, where they're -- they were docu- doing a documentary about the fire, um --
R:  Oh yeah, I did see part of that.
L:  -- worker -- fire fighters.  Right.  And it's totally separate any kind of terrorist activity, because it hadn't happened yet --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they were filming and it was behind the fire fighter's head you see this plane flying very low and hitting the building --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- because they were just kind of -- I guess they were filming near that area --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they just happened to have that --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- World Trade Center in the camera view and that's when you go back, "Wow, that must have been so bizarre" to have like --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- things from everyday ordinary to all of a sudden --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this horrific thing.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So --
R:  And I think -- but I think, you know, the people now that they're -- when they're flying -- my husband flies a lot -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um how calm I think people no- are now taking charge like if something happened --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I think they kind of are calmer and do take things into their own hands --
L:  Right.
R:  -- more now than they would --
L:  Yeah, I remember that --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- shoe bomber where -- where the -- the -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] passengers ganged up on him and tied him down.
R:  Oh yeah, it was like -- and wow, what would -- you know, what would you do?  I don't -- you know, I guess my husband thinks about it, he's like, "Yeah, I would jump on the guy too".
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Instead of panicking, I think people there are maybe taking charge.
L:  And maybe that's true that people are -- would be less, you know, apt to panic if that -- the same thing were to happen again --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they've kind of readied themselves for it --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And it seems like there's some -- I think the greater the numbers, the greater the p- ah, possibility of panic because you -- like you said, pe- people kind of get swept up in each other's emotions --
R:  Mhm.  That's true.
L:  -- so, I think like if it were one or two, three people as opposed to like fifty or even a hundred, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a very different scenario.
R:  Because you could um -- you're going to have people on one -- one end and people on, you know, taking charge and then you're going to have your people panicking and that kind of spreads like wildfire.
L:  Yes.  I think mass kind of -- kind of like it feeds on -- like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- even if you were normally a calm person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you saw ten people around you just screaming and freaking out you -- it's just like an animal instinct, you -- you're just going to start panicking --
R:  Right.
L:  -- along with them.
R:  Right.
L:  And of course, you know, the -- the larger the number of people, the more like the logistics get complicated, like about escaping or, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- any kind of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you're in a con- confined space and the more people there are --
R:  Your chances are --
L:  -- the more dangerous it is.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I agree.
L:  So, you -- your husband travels a lot?
R:  He does.  He leaves every Monday and comes back every Thursday.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  So, every time he leaves, I'm like, "Okay, don't die" [LAUGH] "Don't get in a plane wreck".
L:  That's -- that's quite a bit of -- god.
R:  It's hard.  But, you know, he -- he is -- he never worries about it.  He said he's never --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when he's on a plane he never worries about it, just because of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they say that well that your chances of dying on a plane are so great and -- but it's hard, you know, it's still hard for me to sit, when I can think, "Oh, my gosh, what would I do if I got that call?" --
L:  Right.  Right.  Now, w- did you say that your chances of dying on a -- in a plane crash are --
R:  Well, he always says --
L:  Yeah, it's like less than, you know --
R:  -- than in a car.
L:  Or like being struck by lightning is what I heard.
R:  Right.
L:  But you -- you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning than you do --
R:  Than you do dying in a plane crash, yeah.
L:  Plane crash, right.
R:  But it's still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because he flies so much, I'm like [LAUGH] well, --
L:  True.  And what about -- have you like, I mean, has SARS affected you in any -- at all?  Like h- has that made you even more worried or does he not --
R:  I -- it -- I have felt removed from that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- because I thought, "Oh, well, that's so far away" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but my Dad, you know, when the kids were sick around that time, he's like, "Have you taken 'em in, I mean, how do you know it's not SARS?" and I'm like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Dad, because it didn't even cross my mind that it could be SARS you know --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- they get sick all the time.
L:  Yeah and I see, um, there were like, I think last time I checked it was like um three or four months ago on the -- the health organization website, there were like seventeen documented cases in New York -- New York City, or New York State, I couldn't tell.
R:  Wow.  I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.  And there was one story that I read in the newspaper that kind of brought it closer to me, which is there's this Chinese American lawyer who worked in the World Trade Center and he survived nine eleven --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and after that he quit his job to work in education and kind of working in between um I guess Taiwan and here --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- and after surviving nine eleven he succumbed to the SARS virus while on a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- flight --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- with a -- I guess an old man who turned out to be a super carrier, so it was really --
R:  So, he died?
L:  He died.  He died in -- he died in China.
R:  Oh.
L:  And his wife, you know, couldn't do -- like -- because first of all doctors didn't give him an i- anti like viral medicine --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Right.
L:  -- for SARS. They weren't doing all that was possible because they said, "Well, we're -- we're not sure what it is" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and here in the States she was saying that she could have sued them for malpractice --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and but since it happened over in China, there's nothing she can do about it.
R:  Yeah.  My initial reaction about that was that it could have been a --
L:  Terrorist manufactured -- 
R:  -- terrorist -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  The timing of it was certainly kind of weird.
R:  Skeptical, yeah.
L:  And you have all these like people that you know, just [PAUSE] oh, this is whole -- the whole doomsday scenario --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where [PAUSE] the four riders of the apocalypse kind of thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the war and the disease and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  And you start wondering, "Oh my gosh, can that be true?" [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, not seriously.
R:  I know.  And your mind starts, you know, going, you know, to the worst.  Now, that's how I am because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- everything is -- is some kind of terrorist related.
L:  It's -- you know, it's -- it's funny because n- the whole atmosphere in the United States now is so different from what it was like five years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Mhm.  Very much so.
L:  When the economy was good and no one had any kind of worries and it was all --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- like boom and now it's like everything's -- the economy sucks and --
R:  It -- it is and it --
L:  -- the orange alert and, you know --
R:  -- and there's so many fears now, especially, you know, with having children and I was pregnant on September eleventh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I delivered in January --
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  -- and my thoughts were, "What am I doing bringing a child into this world?" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that is scary.  And, you know, how could I do that?  B- you know
