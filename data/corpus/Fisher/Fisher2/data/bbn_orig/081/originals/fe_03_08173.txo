L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Carly.
L:  Hi, my name is Shelley.
R:  Hey, how's it going?
L:  Not too bad.
R:  Okay.
L:  Where you calling from?
R:  Ah, Brooklyn, New York.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Lincoln, Nebraska.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Cool.  How is Nebraska?
L:  Hot.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool.  Have you been there a long time?  Living there?
L:  Yeah, I pretty much grew up here.
R:  Oh, cool.  Is it beautiful out there?
L:  Yeah.  There's tons of trees, lots of grass --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- plains [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- corn [LAUGH].
R:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] Cool.
L:  Okay.  Are they supposed to prompt us, or are we just supposed to go?
R:  Um, I guess just go, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I've done this once before, but that's all.  But um --
L:  So, family values.
R:  Yeah, I mean it's a weird topic because um I mean I'm twenty seven, so I -- I haven't necessarily seen an increase in the divorce rate, it's just always been high in my lifetime, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um -- so many of my friends, I haven't come from a divorced household, but, you know, it seems like more than half my friends have, so it's sort of been kind of you know almost normal [several inaudible words] e- not that it's, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not, you know, I certainly think it's a concern and everything, but it's sort of like I haven't witnessed a great increase in my lifetime.
L:  Right.  No, I agree.  I haven't either.  I did come from a divorced family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but -- or parents, but I was like three --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- when it happened, so I don't even remember it.
R:  Mm.
L:  My step dad is my only dad I've known and he's my dad.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, never questioned that or had reason to, you know, because I wasn't in contact with my birth father --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so -- and I have -- actually I have several friends that have been divorced and have since married for a second time and are happy as can be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, one of them we thought would last and it didn't and I'm still kind of [several inaudible words] I think even they're a little baffled that it didn't --
R:  Really?  Huh.
L:  -- but and then another one we all knew it wouldn't so --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mine was like that.  Everyone else could see it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Are you married now?  So, has it changed your view on marriage at all?
R:  Um, I think I've always had a very sort of non traditional view of a relationship and -- and the world, like don't really aim for per se a traditional marriage or something, but um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean I'm in a relationship now and I guess -- I guess in some ways I -- I am concerned or like not concerned, but um I guess sometimes I do realize how hard it is to keep a relationship and to you know work out the things and you see so many relationships fail or not necessarily [inaudible] but just like see relationships that seem odd in a lot of different ways --
L:  Unhappy.
R:  -- you know?  Want to figure out if they're ready to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not fall into that and, you know.  So far so good but, you know, it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, it's only been a few years that I've been with someone right now.
L:  Right.  Hm.
R:  How about you?
L:  Interesting.
R:  What do you think about it?
L:  I'm married.  We just --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we'll have our eleventh anniversary in a couple of months.
R:  Wow.  Mm.
L:  And we have three kids and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm thirty five which --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  -- in some ways feels older and some ways it doesn't [LAUGH].  But um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I always knew that I'd marry for life, I mean I -- I tell my husband and all my friends and they always knew --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- because I didn't date a lot in high school or even in college, really --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I was always looking for Mr. Right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, I mean I've always been looking for the one, I've never -- and whenever someone would approach me about dating, it was always, "Can I see myself with this person for the rest of my life?" even in high school.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And if I couldn't I didn't bother.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I didn't do --
L:  So, I didn't -- didn't date a lot [LAUGH].
R:  [several inaudible words] And you know, when your standards are that high, it's, you know, limits [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] But it helped me, you know, weed out what I knew I didn't want and from most of my friends' relationships that they had in high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which are always, you know, adolescent --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and menial, basically.  And --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I -- we met when I was twenty -- twenty --
R:  Yeah.  Wow.
L:  -- turning twenty one.  So, we've been together --
R:  And has it been hard at times to --
L:  -- for fifteen years.
R:  -- see -- see it through, does -- does it always kind of just work out?
L:  Um -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, we've never come close to where we'd even consider getting divorced--
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because nothing, we don't -- we just don't go that route, you know, I guess --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when, you know, it just takes a lot of respect and understanding of the other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- person to, you know, you either accept the way they are or you don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if you don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then you're always going to try to change them and that's what's going to cause trouble [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Or you're not going to like the things they do and that's going to cause trouble.  So I -- my sister told me that when I was very young, when I would fight with my friends --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she was like, "Shelley, you know what?" --
R:  It's a hard thing to do again.
L:  -- "Either you're going to like them for the way they are, or you're not" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's how I've based everything since, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  If I don't like the way the person is, then I don't -- I don't have to be friends with somebody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I don't have to like somebody, it's just -- makes it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- more on my terms and you know, I -- I will still be nice to them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not rude to anybody by any means, but --
R:  I mean, there's always parts of anyone --
L:  -- that doesn't mean I have to go out of my way to be friends --
R:  -- you don't always like and it's -- that can be hard too --
L:  -- with them either.
R:  -- compromise the --
L:  So --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Right.  [inaudible] best parts.
L:  Usually you can overlook that and like them anyway.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you um try, I mean are your --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- kids like pretty young, so they don't start to think about -- oh yeah -- oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, my oldest is, will be six.  She -- actually she was born on our anniversary and so she'll be six --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in August and -- and my youngest we just had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- our -- our youngest and --
R:  Do you think that --
L:  -- on March first, so he's only about four months old.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, yeah, they're still young.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And we talked about, gosh what happens, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because we are already thinking about when the kids leave --
R:  That's interesting.  Huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  What happens when the kids leave, are we still --
R:  You're preparing for it.
L:  -- going to like each other?  [LAUGH]  I mean, we talk about it already, so I don't think that'll probably be a problem [LAUGH].  Because we're already worried about it, so we'll make sure that it doesn't happen, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  I just heard of a friend of mine --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that had that happen and -- and I was really shocked --
L:  I know several people that once --
R:  -- since her parents didn't seem like the type but --
L:  -- all their kids left the house --
R:  -- they were so focused on her --
L:  -- the parents got divorced --
R:  -- as an only child that in a way I was like, well maybe that was part of it, they just didn't have a life outside of her and, you know, and really noticed that or something.  So, it's strange, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh. [PAUSE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Mhm.  And so often they've just grown apart and they feel they don't know each other anymore, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of times instead of trying to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rekindle that or, you know, work a- work through it, they just say, "Well, I'm just going to go my separate ways" --
R:  Well.  Oh, gosh.
L:  And I had a friend who actually --
R:  Well, did they -- did they --
L:  -- her parents were divorced but just chose to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- remain in the same household together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- until their kids were ah grown up and -- and gone [PAUSE] Yeah, he did.
R:  Wow.
L:  She didn't.  She was very Italian and um --
R:  Wow, that's interesting, I've never heard of anything like that.  Yeah.
L:  I don't think she --
R:  Huh.
L:  Ah, see none of us even knew that they were divorced until we were in our early high school years and we'd been friends for a long time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ah they just -- he -- he -- I don't think he dated --
R:  Yeah.  Huh.
L:  -- loudly, put it that way.  If he did, it was very discreet, because I don't think he wanted people coming up to my friend and making comments about it --
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] 
L:  So, and I thought --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean it's --
L:  -- well, ah, you know, in a way that's good.  
R:  Hard, you know sometimes --
L:  -- but if the kids know they're divorced, what kind of example is that setting?  You know.
R:  Oh.
L:  We don't want to be together, but we're going to stay together even though we're divorced.
R:  Mm.
L:  And that kind of didn't make sense.  And -- and all the kids in her family --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- have had serious relationship problems.  She's the only one that's married and is still married.
R:  Wow, that's interesting, yeah.
L:  And has two kids.  All the others --
R:  But I do think, yeah --
L:  -- have been divorced, have had --
R:  -- a childhood examples are so important --
L:  -- terrible breakups, they've --
R:  -- even if you think you've [several inaudible words] sometimes you really --
L:  -- just been a mess.
R:  -- have to do a lot of work to really [inaudible] a difficult childhood.
L:  Been kicked out of their houses, I mean it's just, I think, well, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, a little bit, yeah [LAUGH]. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm. [PAUSE]
L:  Mhm.  Well, I don't know if you, you know, watch anything like Oprah [LAUGH] I'm big on Oprah --
R:  Yeah, I've heard some theories like that --
L:  -- but ah she had an expert come on and say that when you get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- married --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're actually -- you get married to the person you marry to heal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what happened in your childhood. [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- it makes sense --
R:  Interesting.  Do -- do you think that -- that makes sense for your relationship?
L:  And the -- the people who end up divorced are people who either haven't come to grips with what they're trying to heal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they're just not getting it from the other person --
R:  They're the things that relate to growing up for you or anything.
L:  -- what they need to heal and so they end up splitting up. [PAUSE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I do.  I do.  I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whenever we fight or argue, it's always about --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- the same things.
R:  Oh.
L:  And [PAUSE] yeah, like I think for me it's ah -- for both of us really it's -- it's a validation thing because he grew up with deaf parents and he had to do a lot for them, he had to translate phone calls, he had to go to meetings with them, he had to do a lot of that kind of st
