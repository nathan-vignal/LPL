R:  Uh, hi, I'm Sarah.
L:  Hi, this is James.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].  Okay --
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Yeah, not bad.
R:  That's good.  Um, [LIPSMACK], all right, so the topic was th- the divorce rate?
L:  Yeah, divorce rate.
R:  Okay.  And then with the second thing, the computer kinda --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- goofed it up [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] like that for you.
L:  It was something about marriage and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm only twenty five [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I'm not married [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.
R:  And I don't really any plans at the moment to get married --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so I don't know how knowledgeable I am here on that [LAUGH].  But [MN] --
L:  Well, I'm only --
R:  What was your opinion?
L:  -- nineteen, and uh --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I'm not married either, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, [MN] let's see -- hm, got ten minutes to fill [SIGH].  Um, I do think that there's a high divorce rate [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah, of course.
R:  -- uh, with -- I think it's like fifty percent now.
L:  It is about fifty per cent, yeah.
R:  I heard that on Dr Phil --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] I watch that show.  Uh, anyhow, [SIGH] yeah, so I mean, that's not good [LAUGH].
L:  So, um, yeah, in my dorm, as a matter of fact, like, almost all my friends --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, all of their parents are divorced and --
R:  Yeah, well, I actually -- my parents are not divorced.
L:  Okay.
R:  Surprisingly.  Well, probably about half my good friends' parents are --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so that would be just like the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- statistics said [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.
R:  Come to think of it --
L:  It's --
R:  -- it's about fifty per cent.
L:  It's a very common thing now, these days.
R:  Yeah, I -- well, I do think that people that do ge- get married, they don't really [SIGH] -- I know that on the Dr Phil show [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they always say -- everyone spent a lotta time planning the wedding but nobody plans for the marriage, so --
L:  That's -- that's very good.
R:  -- they're planning for the wedding day, but then nobody really thinks about, "Oh, well, you know, how are we gonna divide up our money and how are we gonna -- you know, are we gonna have kids?  Aren't we gonna have kids?" [SIGH] So, I guess that stuff is important.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, hmm, let's see -- what else about marriage?  Um, I don't know.  So, your parents are divorced.  Do you think --
L:  No, my parents are together.
R:  [inaudible] Oh, you said in your dorm that the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In my dorm, the kids in my dorm, like even my roommate, and I mean it just -- it's just really difficult on him, 'cause, like, he's got his, uh, stepdad here and, like, his real dad's in Denver.
R: [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  Here, I -- we're in, um, California.
R:  Oh, you're from California?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, lucky you.  I'm in Pittsburgh [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
R:  I know, I'd love to move.
L:  [LAUGH] It's nice [inaudible].
R:  I'd get married out there for sure [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [LAUGH] but yeah, well, I know -- I can't imagine if my parents were divorced.  I could imagine that I would probably be a different person --
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.
R:  -- than I am right now [LAUGH].  Because, um, I can't imagine them ever getting a divorce.  Even now that I'm older and I haven't lived at home for a while, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, you know?  Even now, if they divorced, I think that would be, um, pretty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, it'd be tough. That'd be --
L:  It'd be really --
R:  -- definitely strange [SIGH].
L:  -- tough.
R:  So, yeah, I think people --
L:  Because --
R:  -- have -- especially, I mean, if you get a divorce and you don't have kids that'd be one thing.  I think [inaudible] is -- is the most important --
L:  [several inaudible words] the bad part, yeah.
R:  -- important thing.
L:  Because, like, you have -- you have two families.
R:  Yes, and it's the weirdest thing.  I do think -- I might sound like a weirdo, but I do think that's part of the reason why a lot of kids aren't -- aren't in more trouble than, [NOISE] you know, people used to be, like, back in the whatever, fifties or something when there was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not many divorces [LAUGH].  You know?  [inaudible] people probably just, like, you know, [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  Some reason why people get into, like, drugs and stuff.  Among other reasons, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's like, you know?  [LIPSMACK] Some of that [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, anyhow -- hmm.  So, a lotta [several inaudible words] married [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'll never [NOISE] [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, you gotta go to Las Vegas for that one.
R:  What's that?
L:  You gotta go to Las Vegas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for that one.
R:  So, you're pretty close to Vegas, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lotta people get married out there [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  It's easy in Nevada.
R:  Yeah, that's cool.  I, um --
L:  I'm sure -- I'm sure it'd probably lead to divorce though [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, sure -- I'm sure the percentage were from the marriages in Las Vegas.  It's gotta be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- higher [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, probably.  
R:  But, um, hm, let's see.  I think that the lady told me I have to stick to the topic, so I'm trying to think [SIGH] of, uh, what else there is to say about the marriage thing.  [SIGH] I don't know -- friends of mine just married a year ago and they're, uh -- they were in [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] like marriage counselling.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, they -- they're pretty bad.  I used to [SIGH] -- I ha- -- I used to commute with them [LIPSMACK], um, into -- into my job, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] two in the car were, like, screaming match the whole way [LAUGH].  It's terrible.
L:  Wow.
R:  I now commute alone [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's, uh -- so [inaudible] I have firsthand knowledge.  They didn't think [inaudible] [LAUGH], but, um --
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one of my friends, she's from a smaller town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, like, the people in that town, it's co- common for the people to get married at the age of eighteen.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And, so, like, one of her friends turns eighteen and she gets married, like, a couple of weeks later and --
R:  Oh, my God.  That'd be like -- yeah, that'd be like you being married for, like, a year already, 'cause you're nineteen [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I know, like, I couldn't imagine if I had gotten married at eighteen.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's so different for them because they're like, they're not living on their own or anything, neither has, like, a job or a good education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They live, like, with one of their parents.  They just live in one of the [MN] in, um, a room together, and it's just --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- totally weird.
R:  That's -- yeah, that's -- that's weird.  Like, that's [several inaudible words].  I mean, I guess [inaudible] it's about your culture too, like I said.  You know, if that's the way it is in that town or whatever, [LIPSMACK] you know?  But, uh, I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know if that's [inaudible] idea. [LAUGH].  How much of that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what's the divorce rate in that town? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, probably a lot more.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.  
L:  I -- I guess -- I guess lots of it has to do with religion also.
R:  Oh, that's true, [SIGH] right, exactly.  A lot of people won't even get a divorce because of their religion --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  Which is, I guess, could be a good thing or a bad thing [LAUGH] depending -- depending on who they married.
L:  [inaudible] forced to stay together. [LAUGH]
R:  What's that?
L:  They're forced to stay --
R:  Right.
L:  -- together then.
R:  Yeah, that's -- yeah, I don't think -- sometimes that's not good either.  I guess that just depends on the situation, but --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- there's definitely -- there's something going on, because -- you know -- I don't know.  That's probably gotta be the highest divorce rate ever, I don't think it ever was -- [SIGH] [several inaudible words] higher, so --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Something's going on in America. [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Another -- another -- another one of the questions, I think, is how we [several inaudible words] for ourselves, like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- how are we gonna look differently.
R:  Yeah, well, that's a -- yeah, I know for myself, I, um, you know -- like I said, I'm twenty five, and I don't see any, like, any time soon.  I mean, I have a boyfriend, I -- I live with him actually, but [SIGH] I don't see us getting married too soon.  Pr- probably because of, you know, I would take it pretty seriously.
L:  Yeah, it's something we -- we have to take seriously, and I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] in my -- I guess -- well, I'm -- I'm still nineteen, so with my girlfriends and such it's not -- not really looking into marriage [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, right.  
L:  But still, like, there's some things that I see in different girls that, like, if all of them combined together, I guess they'd be the perfect girl, but you're, like, never gonna find them.
R:  Right [LAUGH], right.  It takes a lot of work to find them [MN].  Who knows when that will ever be [LAUGH].
L:  So, it gets really hard, and then, [several inaudible words] way too long, then you're just gonna become desperate and make it even worse on yourself, and --
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.  I know some -- I guess I'm -- I'm kinda older.  I mean, I guess a lotta people my age do get married, but I, um, I think that's the other thing, too.  I think a lot of people are, like, waiting.  People don't get married as young any more.  But I don't know if that -- you'd think that'd be good, [SIGH] you know?  [several inaudible words] --
L:  But --
R:  -- mature, but -- but, yeah, like, if you wait too long --
L:  My -- my cousin got married, uh, last weekend --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he's, um, thirty -- thirty eight.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's his first marriage?
L:  First marriage.
R:  Oh, huh, how 'bout that?
L:  And, I mean, they had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the wife and him both together, they're great together and I guess they -- they might be a good match, but it also seemed like they kinda both are desperate and they just --
R:  Yeah, but that point, that's true.  I don't know, I guess [MN] people don't wanna be alone for the rest of their lives, you know?  
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Once you start pushing on forty, I guess you probably [NOISE] [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, you know, if I was in -- even if -- once I turn thirty, if I'm not married by then I probably would start thinking, like, "Okay, thirty now" [LAUGH].  That's not too far off, it's only five years.  So, but, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah, I could see that too.  Maybe you wanna kinda rush into something with somebody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you hadn't found that perfect one out there yet [LAUGH].  [SIGH] But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, so I don't know.  Hm.  I'll have to just have to wait and see, I think [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Something you should be a little more worried about than I am at the moment.
R:  Yeah, right, it's probably more pressing matter for me [LAUGH].  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm not, like -- I just do think, too, that people get married later, then they're not having their kids 'til later, and, uh, you know, I think it's a lot of people -- don't really necessarily on the topic, but, you know, when they, uh, like you -- when you only get married if you're, like, thirty, then, like, that's kinda -- you know, you're -- if you're a woman, you're getting older and you're gonna have a little kid and [SIGH] -- it's like, instead of being, like, you know, in your twenties when your kid's growing up, you're gonna be, like, in your thirties and forties.
L:  Yeah, you're gonna be thirties and forties.
R:  So, like, it's kinda --
L:  I guess the children [inaudible] raised up differently also.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Maybe you -- maybe you get more irritable and then you'd want a divorce, I don't know [LAUGH].  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, 'cause you're all [LAUGH] -- I don't know, I used to think, like, my God, you're forty, you're old.  But now that I'm twenty five, I don't think that [LAUGH] forty is all that old.
L:  Not that old, huh?
R:  It's just that [MN] -- I'm like, and now it's you're old if you're fifty [LAUGH].  Just keeps getting pushed back, but hey.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, we -- we're -- we're living longer too, so --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  You're right.  But, um, maybe that's -- maybe there's more divorce [LAUGH] because people are living longer.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's more time they gotta stick it out, and they just can't hack it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Oh, well --
L:  [LAUGH] Maybe it is.
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].  [SIGH] We'll see, hm [LIPSMACK].  Let's see, well, they -- the lady told me the topics may be about our pet.  Maybe tomorrow I'll get something like pets, I got a lotta cats [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  Whoever I get married to will have to accept my cats [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Be like an old cat lady.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, anyhow.  Hm.  Any other [MN] interesting marriage --
