R:  Hi.  My name's Laura.
L:  Hi.  My name's Kristin.
R:  And I am a non smoker.  Um, we're supposed to tell each other this?
L:  I don't know.  I'm a smoker.  H- --
R:  Okay.  Well, how do you feel about the ban of smoking in public places?
L:  I think it's a good idea.
R:  You do?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  I don't mind it.  I don't mind smokers.  I figure that's their choice and, um, it's never bothered me.
L:  I mind it because of the children.
R:  Okay.  That's a good topic there.  You're absolutely right.
L:  'Cause I have a child and I don't like anybody smoking around him.
R:  Okay.
L:  Or, like, the older people, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that are on oxygen or anything else and ... [PAUSE]
R:  Yes.  So, then do you go outside to smoke?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay. [PAUSE] Um, what else were we supposed to talk [LAUGH] about?
L:  I don't know.  I've never done one like this.
R:  Me neither.  Okay.  Um ... [PAUSE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah ... [LAUGH] Is this your first one?
L:  Yeah, like this.
R:  Okay.  It's mine too.  Um, [PAUSE] okay, and, ah, [PAUSE] what else are we supposed to talk about? [PAUSE]
L:  I have no idea.
R:  Okay. [PAUSE] Ah --
L:  They said ten minutes of this?
R:  Mhm.  Ten minutes of this, ah, smoking conversation. [PAUSE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um, so, you -- you think they should ban smoking in public places?  It really doesn't matter to me.  Um, [PAUSE] how about, [PAUSE] um ... let's see, doesn't California have some laws -- state law or -- where you can't inside period or something like that?
L:  I don't know.
R:  Okay. [PAUSE] Well, what would you like to talk about with smoking? [PAUSE]
L:  I've, pretty much, said my views on it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay. [PAUSE] Um, [PAUSE] your comment about the older adults and smoking around them, that was a very good comment.  You always think about children and what the effects it'd have on children but you don't think about the elderly populat- population what ...
L:  It does to them?
R:  Yes.  That was a very good point. [PAUSE]
L:  And being a smoker, I -- I respect that, you know?  I think it's stupid when they go thr- -- when you in a restaurant, you say you don't want smoking but you have to walk through the smoking to get to the non smoking.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.  That's awful.
L:  That's pretty stupid.
R:  It is.  I just don't understand smoking period because I've never been a smoker and, um, my parents and grandparents are chain smokers and I just -- it doesn't satisfy -- I mean, what does it do for you?
L:  I've been smoking for years.  I don't know.
R:  You don't know? [PAUSE] I- it -- is --
L:  It's just a bad habit that you have.  Like, everybody has bad habits and mine's smoking.
R:  Okay. [PAUSE] I just can't equate any other bad habit to smoking besides, maybe, eating.  I -- I'm just -- I'm trying to understand it because my, um, ex husband and I got back together and he picked up smoking while I was gone and I just -- I just don't understand why he does that and I just [PAUSE] don't know why he would crave something like that. [PAUSE]
L:  He was never a smoker before?
R:  No. [PAUSE]
L:  Hm. [PAUSE]
R:  I don't know. [PAUSE] What about the smoking of cigars?  How do you feel about the --
L:  That's disgusting.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They stink and ... [PAUSE]
R:  But they're becoming more popular, the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- cigar houses and such. [PAUSE] How ... [PAUSE] I don't think that's good to, um, you know, have whole restaurants and stuff dedicated to the smoking of a cigar [PAUSE] like I've seen. [PAUSE]
L:  Cigars stink worse than cigarettes do.  They just linger.
R:  Yes. [PAUSE] How about pipe smoke?
L:  That's disgusting too.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Um, [PAUSE] are you looking at a clock at all?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  They say their lives[?] it'll take forever.
R:  I know. [PAUSE] [SIGH] [PAUSE] You know, I could just go off on anything; well, what do you do for a living?  Blah, blah, blah, but you're not supposed to do that. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Are you much of a talker or not?
L:  Not really.
R:  Okay. [PAUSE]
L:  I was busy making dinner and I thought it was one of these surveys, "Press one e- --" you know?  Okay.
R:  Oh.  And so, you've done surveys before?
L:  Mhm.
R:  E- -- didn't know you were gonna have to talk and --
L:  Mm mm.  I never knew it was one like this.
R:  Okay. [PAUSE] I guess I'm sorry.  I've -- I'm one a- -- step ahead of you, I knew what this was all about. [PAUSE] Um, who all do you do surveys with?
L:  All of them.  Everybody.  I -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mm.  I get 'em in my email, I get 'em in the mail.  Yeah.  I -- I do all of 'em.
R:  And do you make, um, good money outta -- or ... has it paid off?
L:  Yeah.  I've gotten paid for 'em.  I -- I just got a check in the mail today for one.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  We're not supposed to be talking about this.  I wonder if we'll get deducted for drifting off?  But [PAUSE] I don't know how to discuss anything more about smoking. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um ...
L:  What was that?
R:  Ah, I was just saying, um, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know what else to do [PAUSE] or talk about smoking.  How do you feel when you see young kids smoking?
L:  With their parents standing there I think it's ridiculous.
R:  Okay.
L:  I work in a -- um, in a store where we do sell cigarettes and parents will come in and get their s- -- kids' cigarettes and I'll tell 'em, "No".  That's what happened to me yesterday.  I'm, like, "No, I need to see your son's I.D."
R:  Oh, really?
L:  She wasn't very happy with me.
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  It's against the law and if I get caught, I'm on camera --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm gonna have a big seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine.
R:  Ew.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I didn't realize that but you are, aren't you, on camera doing that? [PAUSE]
L:  Yep.
R:  Do you get a lotta resistance like that?
L:  Yep.
R:  Is it --
L:  I check everybody's I.D. that I don't think is old enough and they get mad [NOISE] and throw their I.D. at me or cuss me out.  I'm, like, "Oh, well it's my job.  You wanna pay the fine, fine".
R:  Mhm.
L:  "Go somewhere else and have somebody else make the -- pay the fine.  I ain't doing it".
R:  Do you ever get scared of some of the people?
L:  Mm mm. [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's all on camera so if they try anything they're gonna ...  And I'm really good friends with the cops so ...
R:  Oh, that's good. [PAUSE] Um, [PAUSE] I don't know. [PAUSE] Mm mm hm mm. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  So, how'd you get hooked up with surveys?
L:  Online.
R:  Okay.  Was it, like, ah, survey and money dot com or something like that?
L:  What was it?
R:  Ah, I got hooked up through a place called money for surveys dot com.
L:  I think so.  It's where they have all of them listed?
R:  Yeah.  No.  I don't know.  Did you have to pay to get a -- get in?
L:  Huh uh.
R:  Oh.  See, I had to pay, like, a membership fee.  So, I got ripped off. [PAUSE]
L:  Oh, that forty some dollars?
R:  Yeah.
