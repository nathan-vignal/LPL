RIGHT  (fe_03_07312-A-0026)
NO IT'S VERY TRUE WE WERE JUST TALKING MY BOYFRIEND AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE WHEN WE GO TO RESTAURANTS I USED TO THINK IT WAS ALL ABOUT FOOD YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07312-A-0028)
WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS GOOD DETERMINING HOW IF WE LIKED THE RESTAURANT BUT A LOT OF IT IS SERVICE AND IF THEY LET YOU SIT THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND DON'T RUSH YOU THROUGH IT THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER I THINK SOMETIMES  (fe_03_07312-A-0029)
BUT OF COURSE YOU USUALLY PAY MORE AT THOSE RESTAURANTS [LAUGHTER] BUT  (fe_03_07312-A-0030)
THEY TEND TO LEAVE YOU ALONE BUT UM  (fe_03_07312-A-0031)
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE THING TO COOK  (fe_03_07312-A-0032)

ON THE SIDE AND I DON'T WANT AVOCADO AND YOU KNOW AT HOME YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANYONE THAT YOU JUST DO IT SO I DON'T  (fe_03_07312-A-0042)
SOMETIMES IN A RESTAURANT I FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE YOU KNOW NO AVOCADO WITH THE DRESSING ON THE SIDE NO BUTTER YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07312-A-0043)

THE OTHER THING IS I THINK IF YOU WORK LIKE I'VE I'VE WAITRESSED BEFORE  (fe_03_07312-A-0050)
SO WHILE I WAS WAITRESSING I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO EAT OUT AT ALL BECAUSE I THINK BEING AROUND FOOD ALL DAY LONG YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07312-A-0051)
IT GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN I DO GO OUT TO EAT THEN WHICH IS PRETTY OFTEN I ALWAYS FEEL A LOT MORE SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS THE SERVERS NOW  (fe_03_07312-A-0052)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07312-A-0053)

THAT I ALWAYS WANTED PEOPLE TO DO FOR ME WHEN I WAS WAITRESSING  (fe_03_07312-A-0057)

DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU EAT OUT ONCE YOU'VE ALREADY WORKED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07312-A-0059)

FOR INSTANCE IF A FAMILY MEMBER LIKE SOME OF MY BOYFRIEND'S FAMILY IS VISITING WE ALWAYS EAT OUT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WE DO  (fe_03_07312-A-0067)
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK [LAUGHTER] IF THEY WERE SITTING IN MY HOUSE AND I WAS COOKING IT WOULD BE A LOT LESS AWKWARD YOU KNOW 'CAUSE YOU'RE IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN YOU'RE NOT  (fe_03_07312-A-0068)
