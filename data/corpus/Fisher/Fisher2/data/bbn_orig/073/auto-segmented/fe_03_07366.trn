YEAH YEAH I MEAN I GREW UP IN FLORIDA SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CHANGE OF SEASONS DOWN THERE BUT SINCE I'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON AH  (fe_03_07366-A-0009)
I DON'T KNOW I DEFINITELY DO AH I GET SICK WITH THE CHANGE OF SEASONS ESPECIALLY THIS LAST ONE  (fe_03_07366-A-0010)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_07366-A-0012)
YES  (fe_03_07366-A-0013)

YEAH I KNOW WHAT YOU  (fe_03_07366-A-0020)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH THAT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD WAY TO GO  (fe_03_07366-A-0022)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07366-A-0023)
WELL I THINK PART OF IT RELATES TO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE UM IN MY HOUSEHOLD GROWING UP I WAS REALLY GOOD ABOUT YOU KNOW USING THE DISHWASHER AND KEEPING THE KITCHEN CLEAN AND STUFF LIKE THAT AH THE THING IS NOW I LIKE LIVE IN A HOUSE AND SHARE A HOUSE WITH A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND WE DON'T USE A DISHWASHER  (fe_03_07366-A-0024)
AND UM ONCE MY MOTHER SUGGESTED THAT I DID AND SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN JUST UM YOU KNOW KEEPING THE PLACE TO MYSELF AND THAT'S KEPT ME A LOT HEALTHIER  (fe_03_07366-A-0025)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07366-A-0026)
YEAH  (fe_03_07366-A-0027)
OH NO  (fe_03_07366-A-0028)

OH YEAH  (fe_03_07366-A-0030)
YEAH  (fe_03_07366-A-0032)
AND THERE'S OTHER THEORIES AS WELL I MEAN LIKE VIRUSES HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE ACCEPTED MEDICAL YOU KNOW LOOK AT THINGS  (fe_03_07366-A-0033)
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE EASTERN MEDICINES YOU KNOW WHERE THEY DO LIKE ENERGY HEALING YOU KNOW ALL THAT STUFF ACUPUNCTURE UM LATELY THERE'S OTHER TREATMENTS THEY CAN USE TO LIKE BREAK OFF COLDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE PREVENT THEM FROM HAPPENING  (fe_03_07366-A-0034)
YEAH  (fe_03_07366-A-0036)
YEAH I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY A LINK LIKE UM ESPECIALLY UP NORTH I'D NOTICED PRETTY SUSCEPTIBLE TO AH LIKE SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER  (fe_03_07366-A-0037)
AND UM I MEAN IT'S MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED IN NORTHERN STATES THAN SOUTHERN STATES IN WINTER AND UM EVEN A COUPLE OF CLOUDY DAYS IN A ROW CAN BE ENOUGH TO HAVE A IMPACT ON MOODS  (fe_03_07366-A-0038)
AND SO I DISCOVERED OFTEN TIMES UM  (fe_03_07366-A-0039)
SAINT JOHN- JOHN'S WART WORKS VERY WELL IT'S AN ANTI DEPRESSANT AND ANTI VIRAL AS WELL  (fe_03_07366-A-0040)
SAINT JOHN'S WART YOU KNOW THE HERBAL SUPPLEMENT  (fe_03_07366-A-0041)
AND UM AND ECHINACEA WORKS FOR THINGS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF MUCUS  (fe_03_07366-A-0042)
IT'S UM BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT'S ACTUALLY AN ALL NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC  (fe_03_07366-A-0043)

BUT YEAH IT SEEMS TO BE RAINING ALL UM ALL SPRING HERE IN WASHINGTON AND STUFF AND I THINK  (fe_03_07366-A-0062)
THE ALLERGIES UM AND I'VE ALSO HEARD LIKE CHANGE OF TEMPERATURES AH CAN AFFECT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE UM AS WELL YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN IT GETS COLD THERE YOU'RE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VIRUSES BECAUSE BODY HEAT ACTUALLY HELPS THAT'S WHY YOU GET A FEVER WHEN YOU GET SICK  (fe_03_07366-A-0063)
