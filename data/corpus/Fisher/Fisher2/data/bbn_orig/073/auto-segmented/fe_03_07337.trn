WELL NOW IF IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FLU AND FLU SEASON  (fe_03_07337-B-0012)
ARE YOU THERE  (fe_03_07337-B-0013)

YEAH BUT AH SOMETIMES THE FLU SEASON  (fe_03_07337-B-0015)
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FALL IN  (fe_03_07337-B-0016)
SPRING OR WINTER OR IT CAN FALL IN WINTER SPRING  (fe_03_07337-B-0017)
YOU KNOW RIGHT AT THE IN BOTH OF 'EM  (fe_03_07337-B-0018)
IT CAN BE A LONG SEASON OF OF FLU CASES  (fe_03_07337-B-0019)
IN TULSA OKLAHOMA  (fe_03_07337-B-0020)
OUR OUR FLU SEASON USUALLY BEGINS JANUARY  (fe_03_07337-B-0023)

SO OKLAHOMANS CAN GET SICK ANY TIME THEY [LAUGHTER] THEY GET READY TO  (fe_03_07337-B-0025)
YES WE DO  (fe_03_07337-B-0026)
NEVER HAVE BEEN IN BUT I'VE HELPED CLEAN UP CLEAN UP AFTER ONE  (fe_03_07337-B-0027)
SO I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR 'EM  (fe_03_07337-B-0028)
WHAT THE THE RECENT TORNADOS  (fe_03_07337-B-0029)
MORE THAT WE'VE THAN WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE HISTORY OF OKLAHOMA  (fe_03_07337-B-0031)
SO AH AND ONES THAT CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE AND ONES THAT HIT IN THE SAME PLACES THAT HIT BEFORE  (fe_03_07337-B-0032)
THAT WHOLE THING WAS WAS HISTORIC  (fe_03_07337-B-0033)
SO  (fe_03_07337-B-0034)
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND  (fe_03_07337-B-0035)
IT HAS WE HAVEN'T HAD A BAD WINTER WE DID HAVE AH  (fe_03_07337-B-0036)
SOME PRETTY GOOD SNOW THIS LAST YEAR WHICH WAS AH NICE BUT IT WASN'T UM  (fe_03_07337-B-0038)
I THINK SCHOOL WAS CLOSED FOR LIKE THREE DAYS WHICH IS NO BIG DEAL  (fe_03_07337-B-0039)
BUT AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE BAD EXCEPT THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE ON EVEN ONE CHILD BEING HURT  (fe_03_07337-B-0040)
BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS HAD TO DRIVE 'EM TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_07337-B-0041)
I WORK FOR A PRIVATE SCHOOL SO  (fe_03_07337-B-0042)
UM  (fe_03_07337-B-0043)
WE DON'T HAVE BUSES THAT ARE BRINGING 'EM IT'S THEIR PARENTS  (fe_03_07337-B-0044)
AND UM  (fe_03_07337-B-0045)
SOMETIMES THEY JUST WON'T TAKE 'EM IF THE WEATHER'S BAD AT ALL  (fe_03_07337-B-0046)
SO  (fe_03_07337-B-0047)
THE YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH KIDS AT SCHOOL THERE'S NOT ANY POINT IN HAVING IT SO A LOT OF TIMES THAT'S THE REASON WHY IT GETS  (fe_03_07337-B-0048)
IT GETS CLOSED  (fe_03_07337-B-0049)
WHAT KIND OF ILLNESSES WERE WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT  (fe_03_07337-B-0050)
JUST GENERAL ILLNESSES  (fe_03_07337-B-0051)
WELL IF YOU TREAT IT RIGHT AWAY IT LASTS FIVE  (fe_03_07337-B-0052)
WELL I THINK AH  (fe_03_07337-B-0053)
LOTS OF LIQUIDS AND VITAMINS HELPS A WHOLE BUNCH  (fe_03_07337-B-0054)
A LOT OF VITAMIN C  (fe_03_07337-B-0055)
WELL ONLY IF YOU HAVE AN INFECTION THAT CAN'T BE HANDLED BY  (fe_03_07337-B-0056)
YOU KNOW NO ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED UNLESS IT'S FOR A BACTERIAL INFECTION  (fe_03_07337-B-0058)
WELL I THINK THAT THAT THE PUB- GENERAL PUBLIC HAS OVERTAKEN ANTIBIOTICS  (fe_03_07337-B-0059)
BUT AND [MN] THEY YOU KNOW YOU BUILD UP AN IMMUNITY TO 'EM WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY HUSBAND HE JUST  (fe_03_07337-B-0060)
HE HAD EMPHYSEMA  (fe_03_07337-B-0061)
AND HE HAD GOT BRONC-  (fe_03_07337-B-0062)
HAD CHRONIC BRONCHITIS THAT WENT INTO PNEUMONIA AND THEY WERE GIVING HIM SOME PRETTY POWERFUL ANTIBIOTICS BUT THEY JUST DIDN'T WORK  (fe_03_07337-B-0063)
THERE'D BEEN TOO MANY TIMES OF OF BRONC- BRONCHITIS THAT THAT  (fe_03_07337-B-0064)
IT JUST WAS BEGINNING TO BE UNTREATABLE AND AND WE LOST HIM  (fe_03_07337-B-0065)
SO IT'S UM  (fe_03_07337-B-0066)
YOU KNOW THERE ARE ILLNESSES AND THERE ARE ILLNESSES  (fe_03_07337-B-0067)
AND SOME OF 'EM  (fe_03_07337-B-0068)
I I WONDER IF THERE'D BE DIFFERENT WAYS TO TREAT 'EM I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD DO WITHOUT ANTIBIOTICS  (fe_03_07337-B-0069)
BECAUSE WE'VE COME TO RELY ON 'EM SO MUCH BUT  (fe_03_07337-B-0070)
THEN  (fe_03_07337-B-0072)
PEOPLE USED TO DIE AT A LOT YOUNGER AGE TOO  (fe_03_07337-B-0073)
BEFORE THE ANTIBIOTICS  (fe_03_07337-B-0074)
WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE NOW TO KEEP THEMSELVES HEALTHY THINK THEY HAVE TO BELONG TO SOME GYM AND WORK OUT ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_07337-B-0075)
WHERE IN THE PAST TO KEEP YOURSELF HEALTHY WAS JUST CAME ALONG WITH WITH WHATEVER YOU WAS DO- BECAUSE PEOPLE WORKED HARDER  (fe_03_07337-B-0076)
THEY WORKED HARDER AS FARMERS AND AS AH LABORERS  (fe_03_07337-B-0077)
ANY PART OF IT THEY WORKED HARDER AND THEY BUILT THEIR BODIES UP TO THAT HELPED 'EM FIGHT OFF ILLNESSES  (fe_03_07337-B-0078)
SO NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD IT DOES TO  (fe_03_07337-B-0079)
THE SIX PACK OR HOW MUCH TO TO HAVE THE MUSCLES IN YOUR ARMS IF IT DOESN'T  (fe_03_07337-B-0081)
IF IT'S NOT THE  (fe_03_07337-B-0082)
GOOD CONSTITUTION THAT YOU NEED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HELP YOU FIGHT OFF ILLNESS  (fe_03_07337-B-0083)
YOU KNOW AND I'VE I HAD A FRIEND WITH THE HEART THING THAT RAN  (fe_03_07337-B-0084)
AND HE EVEN GAVE LECTURES ON RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE AND HE DROPPED DEAD RUNNING ONE DAY  (fe_03_07337-B-0085)
SO AH YOU CAN'T  (fe_03_07337-B-0086)
YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE ARE ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS AND I KNOW THAT EXERCISE IS BETTER THAN THAN SITTING BUT  (fe_03_07337-B-0087)
IT'S NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER  (fe_03_07337-B-0088)
IT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOT THERE'S A COMBINATION OF A LOT OF THINGS  (fe_03_07337-B-0089)
AND ILLNESSES DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN SOMEBODY'S GONNA DIE BUT IF THEY DO  (fe_03_07337-B-0090)
THEY JUST THEY JUST NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES IN THE FIRST PLACE  (fe_03_07337-B-0092)
YEP  (fe_03_07337-B-0093)
AND LOSE SOME OF THAT WEIGHT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT LOOKING AROUND LATELY BUT [MN]  (fe_03_07337-B-0094)
