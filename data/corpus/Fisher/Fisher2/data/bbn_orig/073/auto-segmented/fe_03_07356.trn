WELL  (fe_03_07356-B-0010)
I I I I'M HEALTHY NOW  (fe_03_07356-B-0011)
BUT I'M A VERY LUCKY PERSON SO FAR BECAUSE UM I WAS VERY SICK  (fe_03_07356-B-0012)
ABOUT UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0013)
SEVEN YEARS AGO  (fe_03_07356-B-0014)
I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE MILOMA  (fe_03_07356-B-0015)
WHICH IS A CANCER OF  (fe_03_07356-B-0016)
IT'S A CANCER OF THE BONE MARROW  (fe_03_07356-B-0017)
AND UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0018)
STATISTICALLY AT THAT TIME VERY FEW PEOPLE LIVED MORE THAN THREE YEARS  (fe_03_07356-B-0019)
IT'S IN THE LEUKEMIA FAMILY  (fe_03_07356-B-0020)
AND IT CAUSES YOUR  (fe_03_07356-B-0021)
WELL IT CAUSES YOUR BONES TO BREAK UP IT CAUSES YOUR KIDNEYS TO FA- IT CAUSES IT JUST WREAKS HAVOC WITH YOUR BODY  (fe_03_07356-B-0022)
AND I  (fe_03_07356-B-0023)
UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0024)
TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT I DECIDED  (fe_03_07356-B-0025)
I KNOW I DECIDED TO LET A COMPUTER CHOOSE HOW I WAS TO BE TREATED BECAUSE THE TWO OPTIONS WERE TO EITHER GET A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT OR TO GET CHEMO  (fe_03_07356-B-0026)
AND I TRAVELED TO THE TO THE I WENT TO THE UM CANCER RESEARCH CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS  (fe_03_07356-B-0027)
WHERE THEY DO AH TWO BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS ONE AFTER ANOTHER  (fe_03_07356-B-0028)
AND I WENT TO THE DANA-FARBER INSTITUTE IN AH WHICH IS IN BOSTON  (fe_03_07356-B-0029)
AND THEY  (fe_03_07356-B-0030)
USED A MORE TRADITIONAL AT THAT TIME A MORE TRADITIONAL  (fe_03_07356-B-0031)
TREATMENT WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY DID AT THE AH HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SO I DECIDED TO BE TREATED AT AT THE HOSP- AT AT PENN  (fe_03_07356-B-0032)
AND UM I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT AND OF COURSE THEY DO BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS THEY DON'T DO CHEM THEY DON'T DO ONE AFTER ANOTHER LIKE THEY DO IN ARKANSAS  (fe_03_07356-B-0033)
BUT ANYWAY I DECIDED I COULDN'T I DIDN'T I  (fe_03_07356-B-0034)
I DECIDED TO TO BE PART OF A RANDOMIZED TRIAL  (fe_03_07356-B-0035)
WHERE A COMPUTER PICKED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO GET CHEMO FOR A YEAR AND CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO GET BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS AND THEY'RE STUDYING THE LONG TERM  (fe_03_07356-B-0036)
RESULTS OF EACH GROUP  (fe_03_07356-B-0037)
SO THE COMPUTER PICKED ME TO GET CHEMO  (fe_03_07356-B-0038)
WHICH I DID AND I'VE HAD A COMPLETE REMISSION  (fe_03_07356-B-0039)
SO UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0040)
YEAH I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE  (fe_03_07356-B-0041)
THEY CLAIM THAT  (fe_03_07356-B-0042)
THE PROBLEM WITH UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0043)
WITH BOTH  (fe_03_07356-B-0044)
TREATMENTS IS THERE ARE SUB MICROSCOPIC CANCER CELLS  (fe_03_07356-B-0045)
AND  (fe_03_07356-B-0046)
WHEN WHEN YOU GET A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT  (fe_03_07356-B-0047)
THEY WIPE OUT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM  (fe_03_07356-B-0048)
AND THEN THEY THEY PUT IN THE NEW BONE MARROW WELL THE PROBLEM IS THE BONE MARROW  (fe_03_07356-B-0049)
IN MY CASE IT WOULD BE AN AUTOLOGOUS  (fe_03_07356-B-0050)
TRANSPLANT WHICH MEANS THEY TAKE YOUR OWN BONE MARROW  (fe_03_07356-B-0051)
AND HOPEFULLY CLEAN CLEANSE IT OF CANCER CELLS  (fe_03_07356-B-0052)
AND THEN GIVE IT BACK TO YOU  (fe_03_07356-B-0053)
RIGHT AS OPPOSED TO GETTING UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0054)
FROM A DONOR  (fe_03_07356-B-0055)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07356-B-0056)
WELL THE PROBLEM WITH THE DONOR TRANSPLANT IS  (fe_03_07356-B-0057)
THAT YOUR BODY CAN REJECT IT AND IT'S FATAL  (fe_03_07356-B-0058)
IT'S CALLED A HOST VERSUS GR- HOST  (fe_03_07356-B-0059)
VERSUS GRAFT DISEASE  (fe_03_07356-B-0060)
SO IT YOU GET YOUR OWN IT'S NOT GOING TO REJECT IT BUT THE PROBLEM WITH GETTING YOUR OWN IS THAT THERE THEY THEY CANNOT BE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SURE  (fe_03_07356-B-0061)
THAT THEY'VE WIPED OUT ALL THE CANCER CELLS  (fe_03_07356-B-0062)
SO ALTHOUGH  (fe_03_07356-B-0063)
YOU MIGHT BE GETTING IT BACK  (fe_03_07356-B-0064)
SO ANYWAY THE BOTTOM LINE IS  (fe_03_07356-B-0065)
UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0066)
BEEN IN REMISSION FOR  (fe_03_07356-B-0068)
SIX YEARS  (fe_03_07356-B-0069)
YEAH  (fe_03_07356-B-0070)
YEAH I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE  (fe_03_07356-B-0071)
AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT I DO  (fe_03_07356-B-0072)
TO TO THERE'S NOTHING THAT I CAN DO OTHER THAN GO SEE THE DOCTOR EVERY SIX MONTHS WHO EX- WHO EXAMINES MY BLOOD PROFILE AND TELLS ME THAT ALL MY BLOOD  (fe_03_07356-B-0073)
COUNTS ARE GOOD  (fe_03_07356-B-0074)
YEAH SO I MEAN  (fe_03_07356-B-0075)
IN TERMS OF PREVENTING ILLNESS  (fe_03_07356-B-0076)
IT IN THAT CASE I MEAN IN THAT SENSE REGARDING THAT THERE- THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THAT I THAT I DO THAT'S SPECIAL  (fe_03_07356-B-0077)
SO UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0078)
I TOLERATED I TOLERATED IT VERY WELL I HAD SOME TINGLING  (fe_03_07356-B-0079)
IN MY AH FINGERS  (fe_03_07356-B-0080)
AND AH OH IN MY FEET  (fe_03_07356-B-0081)
AND I GUESS I THINK I LOST SOME OF THE WHEN I WAS GETTING IT SOME OF THE MANUAL DEXTERITY LIKE LIKE IF I WORE A BUTTON DOWN COLLAR I WOULD HAVE TROUBLE BUTTONING THE BUTTON  (fe_03_07356-B-0082)
BUT AH IT IT WENT AWAY  (fe_03_07356-B-0083)
YES WHEN I ST- WHEN I STOPPED TAKING IT YEAH AND I HAD THE CHEMO THE WAY I GOT THE CHEMO WAS AS AN OUTPATIENT I I WORE A CASSETTE  (fe_03_07356-B-0084)
ON MY BELT  (fe_03_07356-B-0085)
AND UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0086)
THAT WAS PLUGGED IN  (fe_03_07356-B-0087)
N- WE- WELL I DID HAVE THE HAIR LOSS  (fe_03_07356-B-0088)
BUT I HAD THAT WHEN I WAS STARTED IN THE HOSPITAL TO BEGIN WITH I LOST MY HAIR  (fe_03_07356-B-0089)
THEN UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0090)
AH I'LL TELL YOU TRUTH I DON'T REMEMBER WHETHER IT TOOK WHETHER I DIDN'T HAVE ANY HAIR FOR A YEAR OR NOT  (fe_03_07356-B-0091)
I JUST I THINK IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN I WHEN I GOT CHEMO ORIG- TO BEGIN WITH  (fe_03_07356-B-0092)
I THINK I I KNOW I LOST IT BUT I THINK IT GREW BACK WHEN I WAS  (fe_03_07356-B-0093)
GETTING TAKING THE CHEMO GETTING THE CHEMO UM I GUESS I DID IT ON  (fe_03_07356-B-0094)
A WEEKLY BASIS OR A MONTHLY WHATEVER IT WAS I I THINK  (fe_03_07356-B-0095)
THE DOSAGE THAT I WAS GETTING I DON'T REMEMBER TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT'S FUNNY HOW YOUR MIND ERASES THINGS  (fe_03_07356-B-0097)
THAT THAT AREN'T  (fe_03_07356-B-0098)
PLEASANT [LAUGHTER] I I DON'T THINK I WENT A WHOLE YEAR WITH WITH NO HAIR  (fe_03_07356-B-0099)
THAT'S INTERESTING NO  (fe_03_07356-B-0101)
IT'S POSS-  (fe_03_07356-B-0102)
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT I I UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0103)
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT  (fe_03_07356-B-0105)
BUT I AH THE WAY I GOT THE CHEMO WAS I HAD A CATHETER THAT WAS INSERTED INTO MY CHEST AND AND THAT THE CHEMO WENT INTO THAT  (fe_03_07356-B-0106)
AND THEN THEY THEY REMOVED WHEN I WAS FINISHED WITH THE CHEMO  (fe_03_07356-B-0107)
THEY REMOVED THAT CATHETER AND THEY PUT ONE ANOTHER ONE IN IT WAS CALLED A HICKMAN LOOP  (fe_03_07356-B-0108)
WHICH HANGS OUTSIDE OF YOUR CHEST IT GOES INTO YOUR CHEST BUT IT HANGS AND IT'S GOT LIKE THREE ON IT WHERE THEY CAN PLUG IN PLUG INTO IT  (fe_03_07356-B-0109)
SO WHEN I WAS FINISHED WITH THE CHEMO THEY REMOVED THAT AND THEY IMPLANTED A IT'S CALLED A PORTA-CATH IT'S UNDER THE SKIN  (fe_03_07356-B-0110)
WELL I HAVE ONE  (fe_03_07356-B-0111)
BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN USED  (fe_03_07356-B-0112)
BUT I HAVE TO GET IT FLUSHED EVERY SIX WEEKS  (fe_03_07356-B-0113)
WHICH I GO TO THE UM UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0114)
THE CHEMO DEPARTMENT AND  (fe_03_07356-B-0115)
AND THEY  (fe_03_07356-B-0116)
THEY JUST PUT A SALINE THEY PLUG IN AND THEY PUT A THEY PUT A NEEDLE IN  (fe_03_07356-B-0117)
AND THEY INJECT AN SALINE SOLUTION  (fe_03_07356-B-0118)
WHICH CLEANS IT AND THEY CHECK IT FOR BLOOD RETURN IF BLOOD RETURNS IT MEANS IT'S CLEAR  (fe_03_07356-B-0119)
SO IT'S FINE BUT THEY DON'T LAST FOREVER AND I'VE HAD MINE NOW FOR SIX YEARS AND I THINK WITHIN THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR IT IT PROBABLY WON'T GO MORE THAN TEN YEARS BEFORE IT'LL HAVE TO BE REMOVED  (fe_03_07356-B-0120)
YEAH WELL THAT'S NOTHING TO I MEAN THAT THAT SHOULD BE THE WORST THING IS THAT I HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE PORTA-CATH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07356-B-0121)
BUT UM  (fe_03_07356-B-0122)
A FRIEND OF MINE  (fe_03_07356-B-0123)
HAS ONE AND SHE GOT VERY SICK BECAUSE IT GOT AH  (fe_03_07356-B-0124)
