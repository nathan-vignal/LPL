IF YOU SERVE FOOD AND YOU'VE NO ONE'S ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN THE RESTAURANT  (fe_03_07372-A-0016)
WHICH  (fe_03_07372-A-0017)

WHAT ABOUT LIKE BARS  (fe_03_07372-A-0021)
WHAT ABOUT BARS  (fe_03_07372-A-0022)
THAT'S TRUE I JUS- I JUST HAVE A PROB- [MN] PROBLEM WITH IT ON LIKE THE SHARE CAPITALIST LEVEL TO THINK ESTABLISHMENTS LIKE BARS AND RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY ALLOW UM CUSTOMERS TO BE ABLE TO SMOKE MHM  (fe_03_07372-A-0026)
MHM  (fe_03_07372-A-0027)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07372-A-0028)
THAT'S TRUE I JUST THINK THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE DECISION WHEN YOUR GOING TO A AH ESTABLISHMENT LIKE THAT TO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07372-A-0029)
CHOOSE TO OR NOT AND I THINK THE ONLY REASON I'M GETTING UPSET ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE  (fe_03_07372-A-0030)
THERE'S THIS REALLY GREAT PLACE AROUND HERE THAT'S A MIDDLE EASTERN RESTAURANT AND THEY HAVE UM THESE HUGE HOOKAH PIPES AND THEY THESE PEOPLE CAN SMOKE FLAVORED TOBACCO AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THERE'S NICOTINE IN IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT BECAUSE OF THE SMOKING ORDINANCE  (fe_03_07372-A-0031)
THEY HAVE TO GET RID OF THE HOOKAH PIPES WHENEVER IT'S TAKING EFFECT AND THAT'S UPSETTING ME BECAUSE I ENJOY LIKE SMOKING THE HOOKAH  (fe_03_07372-A-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_07372-A-0033)
MHM  (fe_03_07372-A-0034)
AND THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE  (fe_03_07372-A-0036)
THAT MAKES SENSE  (fe_03_07372-A-0037)
I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT ON UM THIS QUESTION OF THE DAY WITH HABITS THEY INCLUDED A BUNCH OF STUFF LIKE YOU KNOW ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN THEY INCLUDED GOSSIPING  (fe_03_07372-A-0038)
YEAH  (fe_03_07372-A-0039)

YEAH  (fe_03_07372-A-0043)
YEAH I SORT [MN] OF THE ONLY THING I HAVE WITH THE GOSSIPING IS JUST IF IT'S VERY GENERAL AND VAGUE 'CAUSE AGAIN YOU CAN BE GOSSIPING ABOUT SOMEONE'S HAIR CUT OR SOMETHING YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT AND I JUST FIND IT ODD THEY  (fe_03_07372-A-0044)
INCLUDED THAT IN BAD HABITS  (fe_03_07372-A-0045)

I THINK IT'S AH HEALTHY ACTUALLY A LOT OF THE TIME WHEN YOU DO IT LIKE IN A CONTROLLED SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE NOT REVEALING INTIMATE SECRETS ABOUT SOMEONE YOU KNOW EVERYONE TALKS OF THE  (fe_03_07372-A-0047)
YEAH EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS LIKE A LITTLE BIT WHEN THEY'RE NOT AROUND AND IN THEORY THAT COULD BE CONSISTED GOSSIPING BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A BAD HABIT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07372-A-0048)

THERE'S M- M- VERY IMPORTANTLY COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT  (fe_03_07372-A-0063)
AND YOU KNOW GOSSIPING HAS SOCIAL STIGMA ATTACHED TO IT I SUPPOSE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A HORRIBLE GOSSIP PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO REVEAL ANY SECRETS TO YOU  (fe_03_07372-A-0064)
AND  (fe_03_07372-A-0065)
ALTHOUGH YOU DO GET A LOT OF BELLIGERENT DRUNKS AND THEY CAN BE AFFECTING OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THEM  (fe_03_07372-A-0068)
