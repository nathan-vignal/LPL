MHM BUT OF COURSE IF SOMEBODY'S DRINKING UM  (fe_03_07398-A-0046)

MM IT COULD BE OR IT COULD BE CLOSE TO UH AS BAD AS SMOKING  (fe_03_07398-A-0052)
DEPENDING  (fe_03_07398-A-0053)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07398-A-0054)
WELL HERE'S HERE'S ONE HOW UH I DON'T THINK THEY MENTIONED WHAT ABOUT BODY ODORS  (fe_03_07398-A-0055)

WELL THEY WOULD BE BUT THE THE FACT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU'D BE HELPING THEM THOSE PEOPLE  (fe_03_07398-A-0064)
THAT HAVE THAT PROBLEM UH EVERYBODY AVOIDS  (fe_03_07398-A-0065)
THE CONFRONTATION ABOUT IT AND UH ONE OF THE BIGGEST FAVORS YOU COULD DO FOR THEM IS TO UM BRING IT UP AND DEAL WITH IT  (fe_03_07398-A-0066)
AND IT'S A PAINFUL SUBJECT BUT I'VE HAD THAT SITUATION UH WITH ONE PERSON UH WHO I'VE KNOWN FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AND I NOTICED THAT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DEALT WITH HER NOTICED IT TOO  (fe_03_07398-A-0067)
AND I HAD THE COURAGE TO UH DEAL WITH IT AND I HAD TO DEAL WITH IT MORE THAN ONCE ALSO  (fe_03_07398-A-0068)
AND UH SHE WAS SHE'S A SHE'S A VERY UM SHE'S GOT SOME VERY GOOD QUALITIES SHE SHE DOESN'T GOSSIP ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AT ALL WHICH UH IS KIND OF UNUSUAL I THINK I THINK UH PEOPLE  (fe_03_07398-A-0069)
TEND TO FALL INTO THAT AND I ADMIRED HER FOR THAT BUT SHE ALSO HAD UM PROBABLY THE WORST ODOR PROBLEM I'VE EVER COME ACROSS  (fe_03_07398-A-0070)
SO I WAS ABLE TO TELL HER THAT AND UM SHE TOOK IT WELL  (fe_03_07398-A-0071)
AND SHE SAID UH THAT SHE WASN'T REALLY AWARE OF HOW SHE SMELLED  (fe_03_07398-A-0072)
MHM  (fe_03_07398-A-0073)
UH-HUH YEAH UH-HUH  (fe_03_07398-A-0074)
A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE  (fe_03_07398-A-0075)
ACTUALLY  (fe_03_07398-A-0076)
IT'S UH  (fe_03_07398-A-0077)
I WANTED TO MENTION THAT THOSE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT THAT IS BASED ON ARE ACTUALLY BOGUS  (fe_03_07398-A-0078)
YES THAT IS UH  (fe_03_07398-A-0079)
HELLO  (fe_03_07398-B-0001)
HI  (fe_03_07398-B-0002)
OH OKAY THIS IS NATESHA IN PENNSYLVANIA  (fe_03_07398-B-0003)
YES  (fe_03_07398-B-0004)
PHILADELPHIA  (fe_03_07398-B-0005)
REALLY  (fe_03_07398-B-0006)
WOW  (fe_03_07398-B-0007)
OH OKAY  (fe_03_07398-B-0008)
OH UH IN THE PAPER  (fe_03_07398-B-0009)
WHICH DO YOU THINK IS WORST OR SHALL I GO FIRST  (fe_03_07398-B-0011)
OKAY I THINK SOME UH THERE WAS GOSSIPING OVEREATING NOT EXERCISING SMOKING DRINKING  (fe_03_07398-B-0012)
AND SOME OTHER STUFF BUT I DEFINITELY THINK GOSSIPING IS MUCH WORSE  (fe_03_07398-B-0013)
BECAUSE IF YOU OVEREAT OR YOU SMOKE OR YOU DRINK OR YOU DON'T EXERCISE THEN YOU'RE ONLY AFFECTING YOURSELF BUT GOSSIPING CAN  (fe_03_07398-B-0014)
IT CAN AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE IN A REALLY NEGATIVE WAY  (fe_03_07398-B-0015)
SO THAT'S DEFINITELY THE WORST  (fe_03_07398-B-0016)
IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_07398-B-0017)
OH YEAH TALKING EXCESSIVELY RIGHT  (fe_03_07398-B-0018)
MHM THAT IS PRETTY RUDE  (fe_03_07398-B-0019)
[COUGH] BUT I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING  (fe_03_07398-B-0020)
AND SOMEONE DOESN'T FIND IT INTERESTING THEN THEY SHOULD SAY SOMETHING TO LET YOU KNOW THAT  (fe_03_07398-B-0021)
THAT THEY DON'T FIND IT ALL THAT INTERESTING I MEAN WHY SIT THERE AND LET THEM TALK AND TALK AND TALK AND GO ON AND YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED AND YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION AND  (fe_03_07398-B-0022)
OH I SEE WELL IF SOMEONE WAS TALKING WELL PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT THEY'LL TALK AND TALK FOR INSTANCE LIKE UH  (fe_03_07398-B-0023)
AT WORK IF I ANSWER THE PHONE SOMEONE WILL TALK AND TALK AND TALK AND THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT OTHER CALLS ARE COMING THROUGH AND THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE I HAVE TO CALL AND I'M TOO BUSY  (fe_03_07398-B-0024)
SO I JUST GIVE THIS REALLY KIND OF UNINTERESTED BLAND RESPONSE [LAUGHTER] AND I GUESS IT'S RUDE ON MY PART BUT LIKE YOU SAID I CAN'T COME OUT AND SAY YOU'RE TALKING TOO MUCH AND I'M NOT INTERESTED SO I SAY REALLY UH-HUH UH-HUH  (fe_03_07398-B-0025)
OKAY WELL LISTEN AND THEN I GO ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT AND USUALLY I'D SAY NINE TIMES OUTTA TEN THEY GET THE POINT  (fe_03_07398-B-0026)
BUT IF YOU KIND OF INDULGE LIKE REALLY I DON'T BELIEVE DID THAT REALLY HAPPEN THEN THEY JUST IT JUST FUELS THE FIRE  (fe_03_07398-B-0027)
OH DEFINITELY  (fe_03_07398-B-0029)
YEAH BECAUSE SMOKING DRINKING  (fe_03_07398-B-0030)
EATING TOO MUCH NOT EXERCISING THEY'RE ALL PERSONAL CHOICES BUT  (fe_03_07398-B-0031)
AND I MEAN THERE'S JUST THERE'S A REALITY THERE EVEN IF I I GUESS UNLESS YOU'RE IN DEEP DENIAL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING  (fe_03_07398-B-0032)
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PERSON WHO SMOKES THAT DOESN'T KNOW THAT IT'S TRULY BAD FOR THEM OR WHO DRINKS AND THEY DON'T KNOW THAT DRINKING IN EXCESS IS BAD FOR THEM AND  (fe_03_07398-B-0033)
BUT GOSSIPING I MEAN JUST LET'S JUST SAY THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE THERE'S A. AND A B. AND THEY'RE GOSSIPING ABOUT C.  (fe_03_07398-B-0034)
AND SOME OF THE FACTS ARE MISCONSTRUED OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW AND IT COULD AFFECT IT COULD AFFECT THE WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE VIEW C. AND IT CAN BE TOTALLY UNTRUE  (fe_03_07398-B-0035)
WAS IT THE MOST ANNOYING THING OR THE MOST  (fe_03_07398-B-0037)
WAS THAT THE WORDS THEY USED BECAUSE IF IT'S ANNOYING I MHM  (fe_03_07398-B-0038)
RIGHT [COUGH] I THINK EXCUSE ME I THINK IF I HAD TO CHOOSE THE MOST ANNOYING  (fe_03_07398-B-0040)
SEE FOR ME  (fe_03_07398-B-0041)
SOMEONE TALKING TO ME EXCESSIVELY ISN'T THAT ANNOYING JUST BECAUSE I THINK I'VE MASTERED THE ART OF TUNING PEOPLE OUT  (fe_03_07398-B-0042)
AND SOMEONE WILL TALK AND I'LL TUNE IN JUST ENOUGH TO CATCH KEY PHRASES SO THAT MAYBE THEY'LL THINK I'M LISTENING BUT REALLY I'M NOT BUT I THINK THE THE OTHER MOST UH  (fe_03_07398-B-0043)
THE WORST THING WOULD HAVE TO BE LET'S SEE  (fe_03_07398-B-0044)
SMOKING  (fe_03_07398-B-0045)
ONLY BECAUSE  (fe_03_07398-B-0046)
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T WANNA SMELL SMOKE LIKE IF SOMEBODY'S DRINKING ALCOHOL AND YOU DON'T DRINK I MEAN BY THEM DRINKING ALCOHOL YOU'RE NOT  (fe_03_07398-B-0047)
REALLY EXPERIENCING ANY DISCOMFORT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BUT WHEN SOMEONE'S SMOKING AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO SMOKE OR YOU DON'T WANNA SMELL SMOKE AROUND YOU THEN I THINK THAT'S AN INVASION OF  (fe_03_07398-B-0048)
HM I DON'T WANNA SAY PRIVACY IT'S AN INVASION OF PER- THEIR PERSONAL SPACE  (fe_03_07398-B-0049)
OH YEAH WELL THEN THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07398-B-0050)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07398-B-0051)
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT LIKE AS OPPOSED TO SMOKING LIKE MAYBE DRINKING COULD BE MORE ANNOYING  (fe_03_07398-B-0052)
THAN SMOKING  (fe_03_07398-B-0053)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07398-B-0054)
HM I DON'T THINK THE OTHER TWO I THINK IT WAS EATING TOO MUCH OR NOT EXERCISING OR TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF  (fe_03_07398-B-0055)
OH DID THEY SAY THAT  (fe_03_07398-B-0057)
OH  (fe_03_07398-B-0058)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07398-B-0059)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07398-B-0060)
YEAH AND IT'S REALLY IT'S A REALLY  (fe_03_07398-B-0061)
SENSITIVE SITUATION  (fe_03_07398-B-0062)
YOU KNOW WHAT  (fe_03_07398-B-0063)
IT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW MUCH I WAS AROUND THEM  (fe_03_07398-B-0064)
LIKE UH LET'S SAY FOR INSTANCE IT WAS SOMEBODY I LIVED WITH LIKE IT WAS A ROOMMATE OR SOMETHING I WOULD DEFINITELY  (fe_03_07398-B-0065)
TALK TO THEM ONE ON ONE  (fe_03_07398-B-0066)
BUT IF IT WAS SOMEBODY I SAW ONCE A WEEK OR FIVE MINUTES A DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I'D JUST TRY TO AVOID THEM  (fe_03_07398-B-0067)
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T FEEL CLOSE ENOUGH TO THEM TO I MEAN BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY'D BE PRETTY EMBARRASSED TO HAVE YOU COME TO THEM AND SAY HEY YOU STINK  (fe_03_07398-B-0068)
YEAH  (fe_03_07398-B-0069)
I THINK THAT'S THE CASE A LOTTA THE TIME THAT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SO USED TO THEMSELVES  (fe_03_07398-B-0072)
THAT AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT YOU COULD ALMOST COMPARE THE SAME THING TO  (fe_03_07398-B-0073)
TO UH SMOKING  (fe_03_07398-B-0074)
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BECAUSE LIKE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S THE SMELL OF THE SMOKE THAT REALLY BOTHERS THEM UNLESS SAY FOR INSTANCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BODY ODOR IT'S THE SAME THING BUT THEN THEN THE ISSUE IS THAT SMOKING  (fe_03_07398-B-0075)
IS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TO BE REALLY BAD FOR PEOPLE WHO INHALE THE SMOKE WHO AREN'T SMOKING AT ALL BUT BODY ODOR IT'S IT'S MORE OF AN INCONVENIENCE IT'S NOT LIKE  (fe_03_07398-B-0076)
RIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY  (fe_03_07398-B-0077)
LIFE THREATENING OR SERIOUS OR MAY CAUSE YA HARM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I MEAN YOU JUST YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07398-B-0078)
IT'S KINDA GROSS BUT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07398-B-0079)
THE SECOND HAND SMOKE  (fe_03_07398-B-0080)
