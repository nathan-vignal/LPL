KATRINA ALEXANDER  (fe_03_07315-B-0001)
OKAY HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_07315-B-0002)
SO WHERE I'M GOOD  (fe_03_07315-B-0003)
I ACTUALLY PREFER EATING OUT IF AT ALL POSSIBLE IT'S NOT ALWAYS PRACTICAL BUT I DO PREFER IT THAT MEANS I DON'T HAVE TO COOK  (fe_03_07315-B-0004)
SO WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF  (fe_03_07315-B-0005)
OKAY  (fe_03_07315-B-0006)
AH OKAY SO ARE YOU GUYS ARE YOU REALLY GOOD CHEFS OR YOU JUST LOVE TO COOK  (fe_03_07315-B-0007)
OKAY  (fe_03_07315-B-0008)
MHM WELL THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07315-B-0009)
I REALLY I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN SO I ENJOY GETTING AWAY WHERE I C- I ENJOY GOING TO RESTAURANTS WHERE THERE ARE NO CHILDREN [LAUGHTER] SO THAT I CAN ACTUALLY JUST I THINK EATING OUT IS MORE OF A A KIND OF A FANTASY THING FOR ME JUST  (fe_03_07315-B-0010)
YOU KNOW LEAVE ALL THE DISHES LEAVE ALL THE WORRIES JUST TO BE ABLE TO  (fe_03_07315-B-0011)
GET SOMEWHERE AND RELAX  (fe_03_07315-B-0012)
SO I I I ACTUALLY WILL EAT ANY TYPE OF FOOD I'M NOT REALLY PICKY ABOUT AH WHAT TYPE OF RESTAURANT BUT I JUST LIKE SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S GOOD I GUESS THE ATMOSPHERE MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR ME  (fe_03_07315-B-0013)
SO AND AT HOME BECAUSE I WHEN I'M AT HOME I I'M MY KIDS ARE REALLY YOUNG I HAVE A SEVEN YEAR OLD AND A FOUR YEAR OLD SO THEIR IDEA OF DINNER IS AH A PIZZA OR  (fe_03_07315-B-0014)
FISH STICKS OR CHICKEN NUGGETS SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF I ACTUALLY COOK A REAL MEAL THEY DON'T EAT IT  (fe_03_07315-B-0015)
YOU KNOW I I CAN SLAVE IN THE KITCHEN FOR AN HOUR OR SO AND BRING OUT DINNER AND THEY SAY CAN I HAVE SOME CEREAL OR CAN I HAVE A POP TART  (fe_03_07315-B-0016)
SO THAT HAS TURNED ME OFF AS FAR AS COOKING GOES MAYBE WHEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE OLDER THEN MAYBE I'LL I MIGHT HAVE A DESIRE TO COOK BUT  (fe_03_07315-B-0017)
RIGHT NOW IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST YOU KNOW IT'S A WASTE OF TIME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST COOKING FOR MYSELF  (fe_03_07315-B-0018)
SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I HAVE A SLIGHT AVERSION TO COOKING AND EATING IN AT THIS POINT  (fe_03_07315-B-0019)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07315-B-0020)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07315-B-0021)
RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07315-B-0022)
YEAH AND THAT DOES HAPPEN I KNOW THAT WHEN MY KIDS WERE YOUNGER I YOU KNOW I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHATEVER I COOK THEY'RE GOING TO EAT IT AND THEN YOU KNOW I SAID WELL YOU KNOW I REALISED THAT MY SON WAS NOT EATING EVERYTHING THAT I COOKED AND  (fe_03_07315-B-0023)
DIDN'T WANT TO STARVE HIM TO DEATH SO THEN IT BECAME WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT  (fe_03_07315-B-0024)
AND THAT'S HOW IT GREW INTO THE OKAY WELL I'LL MAKE ONE MEAL FOR MYSELF AND SOMETHING ELSE FOR YOU  (fe_03_07315-B-0025)
SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND I'VE TRIED THAT NOW SO WHEN THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT OLDER MAYBE WE CAN ALL EAT THE SAME THING  (fe_03_07315-B-0026)
BUT EVEN TRYING TO EAT THE SAME THING IT'S ALWAYS A DIFFERENT VARIATION OF THE SAME THING SO IT'S STILL JUST AS MUCH COOKING  (fe_03_07315-B-0027)
SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0028)
I CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND IT'S JUST SO I THINK FOR ME THAT'S THAT'S WHY I DO LIKE TO GET AWAY W- WE NORMALLY  (fe_03_07315-B-0029)
WHEN WE GO OUT TO EAT IT'S NORMALLY LIKE MCDONALDS OR C._C.'S PIZZA OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S KID FRIENDLY OR BUFFET LIKE MY OLDEST SON LOVES CHINESE BUFFET  (fe_03_07315-B-0030)
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S A AND I'VE NOTICED THAT'S THE ONE PLACE HE ACTUALLY WILL EAT SO MUCH FOOD BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A HUGE VARIETY  (fe_03_07315-B-0031)
AND I ASK HIM I SAY WELL WHY DO YOU LIKE TO EAT HERE WELL IF YOU COOKED LIKE THIS AT HOME I'D EAT IT I SAID I'D HAVE TO COOK EVERYTHING  (fe_03_07315-B-0032)
ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT HE MIGHT WANT SOMETHING I'M LIKE OH OKAY  (fe_03_07315-B-0033)
SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0034)
THAT'S THAT'S THE LOGIC BEHIND THAT HE JUST THINKS THAT YOU KNOW IF HE'S SUPPOSED TO EAT A REAL MEAL HE SHOULD HAVE A HUGE VARIETY TO CHOOSE FROM  (fe_03_07315-B-0035)
STILL AND IN THE REAL WORLD IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY  (fe_03_07315-B-0036)
SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0037)
BUT I KNOW ONCE THEY GET BIGGER IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I'M SURE THEY'LL PROBABLY EAT MORE AND SO I'LL DO MORE COOKING AS THEY GROW OLDER BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST  (fe_03_07315-B-0038)
LET'S GET SOMETHING QUICK 'CAUSE WE'RE ON THE GO AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S KINDA WHERE FAST FOOD COMES IN IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE BEST BUT IT'S JUST IT'S FAST FOOD IT'S CONVENIENT  (fe_03_07315-B-0039)
MHM  (fe_03_07315-B-0041)
MHM  (fe_03_07315-B-0042)
REALLY  (fe_03_07315-B-0043)
[LAUGHTER] OH MY GOODNESS  (fe_03_07315-B-0044)
NOW THAT IS UNUSUAL  (fe_03_07315-B-0045)
YEAH NOW SEE I HAVE MY MY AH MY THREE YEAR OLD IS A LITTLE BIT STRANGE IN HIS EATING HABITS BECAUSE HE RARELY EATS BUT HE'S A BIG THREE YE- EVERY TIME PEOPLE SEE HIM THEY THINK HE'S FIVE  (fe_03_07315-B-0046)
SO HE'S A BIG BOY  (fe_03_07315-B-0047)
BUT HE DOESN'T EAT AND WHEN HE DOES EAT HE WANTS TOMATOES  (fe_03_07315-B-0048)
PICKLES  (fe_03_07315-B-0049)
THOUGH THOUGH AND HE WILL EAT THEM TOGETHER  (fe_03_07315-B-0051)
IF WE GO TO A BUFFET HE ALWAYS GETS THE FRUITS AND THE VEGETABLES NO MEAT  (fe_03_07315-B-0052)
HE'S NOT A BIG MEAT EATER I MEAN THE MOST HE'LL EAT IS HE'LL EAT CHICKEN NUGGETS BUT HE HE LIKES HE LIKES FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND HE EATS THEM MIXED TOGETHER  (fe_03_07315-B-0053)
HE WILL EAT A LEMON WEDGE AND THEN EAT A SLICE OF PINEAPPLE OR A PEACH OR THEN EAT SOME CAULIFLOWER WHATEVER YOU HAVE BUT HE HE LOVES TOMATOES AND PICKLES  (fe_03_07315-B-0054)
SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0055)
IT'S JUST YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE WHY COOK JUST BUY SOME TOMATOES AND SOME PICKLES AND HE'S YOU KNOW HE'S GOOD SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0056)
NO I MEAN HE HE LOVES TO EAT VEGETABLES IF I CAN GET MY OLDER ONE TO EAT MORE HE STARTED OUT EATING ZUCCHINI  (fe_03_07315-B-0057)
MY MOM USED TO MAKE ZUCCHINI ALL THE TIME AND SO HE WOULD EAT IT WITH HER AND THEN HE STARTED EATING CAULIFLOWER BUT AS HE'S GETTING TALLER AND OLDER HE SAID WELL I DON'T REALLY LIKE THOSE THINGS ANYMORE I'M GOING TO PASS THEM ONTO MY BROTHER  (fe_03_07315-B-0058)
I SAID YOU DON'T PASS FOOD ON YOU EAT THE FOOD  (fe_03_07315-B-0059)
BUT HE THINKS HE CAN JUST PASS IT DOWN SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0060)
BUT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON HIM 'CAUSE HE'S A HE'S KIND OF A FAST FOOD KID HE LIKES MCDONALDS BUT ONLY THE NUGGETS NO FRENCH FRIES NEITHER ONE OF THEM WILL EAT FRENCH FRIES THEY JUST DON'T LIKE 'EM  (fe_03_07315-B-0061)
IF THEY IF THEY EAT FRENCH FRIES IT'S BECAUSE I I MAKE I MAKE THEM I SAY OKAY LOOK I HAVE TO PAY THREE BUCKS FOR THIS MEAL YOU'RE GOING TO EAT ALL OF IT OTHERWISE I'M JUST GOING TO BUY CHICKEN NUGGETS BUT THEN THEY DON'T GET A TOY  (fe_03_07315-B-0062)
SO THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE OKAY I'LL EAT THE FRIES  (fe_03_07315-B-0063)
REALISTICALLY THEY REALLY DON'T CARE FOR THEM THEY JUST WANT THE THE CHICKEN NUGGETS  (fe_03_07315-B-0065)
SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0066)
I DON'T KNOW WE JUS- I I I DON'T THINK I'M EVER GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR HEALTH BECAUSE THEY DO EAT PRETTY WELL WHEN THEY ACTUALLY EAT AND THEY'RE REALLY ACTIVE SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0067)
BUT YOU KNOW WE SO AND I I NOTICE THAT I'VE TRIED TO BALANCE IT THAT WE DON'T EAT OUT EVERY NIGHT IF WE'RE GOING TO EAT OUT I LOOK AT OUR OUR WEEK AND FIGURE OUT WHAT DAYS WE'RE REALLY RUNNING  (fe_03_07315-B-0068)
AND NORMALLY FOR US LIKE LIKE ON A WEDNESDAY WE'RE RUNNING ALL DAY BECAUSE WE HAVE WORK AND SCHOOL AND THEN CHURCH SO WE'LL TRY TO GET A FAST FOOD MEAL BETWEEN GETTING TO CHURCH BUT THEN I'LL TRY TO COOK TO BALANCE OUT THE REST OF THE NIGHT YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF MAKE IT MORE EVEN  (fe_03_07315-B-0069)
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK THAT IT'S ONLY OR ALWAYS GOING TO BE FAST FOOD  (fe_03_07315-B-0070)
SO AND I THINK MY SEVEN YEAR OLD HE ASSOCIATES EATING OUT WITH MOM GOT PAID SO WHEN MOM GETS PAID WE GET TO EAT OUT  (fe_03_07315-B-0071)
SO AND I SAY WELL HE SAYS WELL CAN WE HAVE TONIGHT NO OH WE MUST BE BROKE  (fe_03_07315-B-0072)
SO THAT'S AH THAT'S HOW HE ASSOCIAT- AND IT IT DOESN'T MEAN NO BECAUSE I'VE SAID SO OR NO BECAUSE I COOKED NO MEANS OH WE MUST BE BROKE  (fe_03_07315-B-0073)
SO THAT'S HOW HE ASSOCIATES IT  (fe_03_07315-B-0074)
YEAH [LAUGHTER] THAT'S IT  (fe_03_07315-B-0075)
[LAUGHTER] IF THAT WORKS IF THAT GETS THEM TO EAT SOMETHING HEALTHY THEN I I'LL USE IT BUT IT'S FUNNY HOW THEY ASSOCIATE THINGS LIKE THAT SO  (fe_03_07315-B-0076)
[MN] I WOULD GO TO THIS REALLY NICE BRAZILIAN RESTAURANT THAT WE HAVE HERE IN HUSTON  (fe_03_07315-B-0077)
IT'S HIGH END REALLY UPSCALE AND THEY THEY DO ALL THE WORK THEY SERVE YOU THEY SERVE YOU RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND THAT'S KIND OF A A NEAT THING TO GO TO I'VE NEVER BEEN BUT I HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS THAT HAVE GONE SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO  (fe_03_07315-B-0078)

AND THEY ARE THEY'RE BLACK BEANS AND THEY'RE COOKED WITH SPICES THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE HAVE IN THE STATES BUT THEY'RE JUST EXCELLENT THE MEATS THAT THEY HAVE ARE SO RICH BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF FAT  (fe_03_07315-B-0081)
AND IT'S JUST THE SEASONING IT'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE FOOD IT'S JUST IT'S AWESOME FOOD REALLY REALLY GOOD FOOD  (fe_03_07315-B-0082)
I THINK THAT WOULD BE MY IDEAL MY IDEAL EVENING  (fe_03_07315-B-0083)
