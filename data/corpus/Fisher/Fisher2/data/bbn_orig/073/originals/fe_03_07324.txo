R:  Hi, my name is Barb.
L:  Hi, my name is Marie.  Ah, do you suffer from allergies during this weather?
R:  No, I do not.  However, my husband does.
L:  Ah.
R:  Ah, do you suffer from allergies?
L:  Oh yes, severely. 
R:  Oh, and what do you do to ...?
L:  Well, ah, I really don't like to take medicine, I'm not a medicine taker --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but if it gets, ah, really bad, I'll ah buy Benadryl and then I have to have anti itch medicine because [NOISE] the flowers when they bloom I ah --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- get rash --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on my ah, arms, my elbows --
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  -- and ah [NOISE], then it itches you know, real, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but ah, and I suffer for it like once -- once it starts get- getting hot.
R:  Wow.
L:  Like, ah, until the season changes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and what does your husband suffer from?
R:  [MN] Anything.  I don't know, it's like in the spring and in the fall of the year.  Something in the air outside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just makes him -- his nose runs and his eyes water and he sneezes and just feels miserable for weeks on end and he's been to the doctors and they've given him different, um, medications to try -- he's tried Claridon[?] and -- and -- I -- a -- a coupla others and ah, he doesn't get much relief ever until --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whatever it is in the environment goes away, but he's pretty miserable -- all --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and it's kind of funny because it didn't start until after he was thirty years old --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all of a sudden one day 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he got allergies --
L:  [NOISE]  Ah, did he used to smoke?
R:  No, he never smoked.
L:  Because I know once I quit smoking [NOISE] I -- I suffer from more -- more allergies now than I've ever done.
R:  Wow, wow.
L:  I mean, I was never allergic to mustard, ah, and I'm allergic to um dijon mustard --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  My throat closed [NOISE] --
R:  Oh my god.
L:  And it was hard for me to breathe and like I said, I never had these allergies until I quit smoking.
R:  Right.  Wow, that's really weird.
L:  I mean, the allergies on my hands -- yes -- but, ah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- once my passages opened up, now I suffer from ah, pollen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ah, the ragweed --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- it's a lot better than smoking anyway, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but ah -- I hate to go to the doctors --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, unless I suffer f- -- I think they want to know anyway if you suffer more than seven days then I'll -- then I'll go --
R:  Exact- -- yeah, that's about the way I am -- I wait until I'm on death's door [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  And then sometimes they -- they give me Flonase[?] to spray up the nose, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then a l- -- easier -- but I'm not the only one in my family -- my daughter has touch allergies -- she touches something -- she could be allergic to it and she'll break out in a rash.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Ah, my husband never suffered from allergies until he turned, ah, fifty --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and ah, now [NOISE] the grass when he's touching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the grass for the lawn and everything he'll starting sneezing and what not.
R:  Right.
L:  You know -- but he -- it's hard [NOISE] this time of year too, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  But I suffer all year -- I'm allergic to dust -- 
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- which is -- I mean, how do you get away from dust? [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, so I try that -- use that Swisel[?] 'cause that helps --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and that'll keep the dust in -- or have to wear a mask [NOISE] when I'm dusting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, say you didn't dust in a week, then I have to use the mask.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause it'll get so bad that [MN] it'll turn into pneumonia.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  They call it allergic pneumonia.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, yeah -- 'cause I don't go to the doctors right away.
R:  Right, right, right --.
L:  I mean, who likes to go to the doctor?
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Your husband hasn't gotten that bad yet right?
R:  [MN] Um, it -- you know, he's been to the doctor several times over the course of the last few years, but it's finally, it's to the point where his allergies are so bad that his eyes just don't stop running and I say --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- "You have to go, you can't keep living like this" --
L:  No, of course not.
R:  -- but then he never goes back for follow ups or [LAUGH] anything, you know [LAUGH] -- so --.
L:  [LAUGH]  No, well that's 'cause you -- you have to wait two hours in the doctor's [NOISE] office --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and you know, it's not like you can just go in [NOISE] and you get taken right away --
R:  Exactly.
L:  'Cause that's -- I know, that's why I don't like to go --
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  -- they're too crowded [NOISE], but ah, I don't think anything really helps anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I even tried that [NOISE] Claridyn[?] that's over the market now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that didn't help.
R:  Right, right, yeah -- Claridyn.  Todd tried and he did not get any relief from it -- so ...
L:  But ah, [NOISE], you know, I try to stay away [NOISE] like -- I won't go [NOISE] to picnics and I won't go to um, camping, because [NOISE] ah -- I'm allergic to pine, too --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- so we can never have --
R:  Yeah, that really alters your lifestyle.
L:  -- a real tree -- yeah, so there's certain things [MN] that I can't do.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And, ah, I'm also allergic to bees. 
R:  Oh.
L:  I got stung by a yellow jack, broke out in hives, almost died.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so that's another thing that -- I'm supposed to carry a little ah -- 
R:   Appenafren[?].
L:   Right, but I don't --
R:  I ah, yeah, well my daughter, she's nine years old now, but --
L:  Oh [NOISE].
R:  -- when she was born, um, I had a normal delivery and everything with her and, by the time she was six months old she suffered from um, what they were calling asthma --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- and then from there they decided, well it's not really asthma --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because you know, when she's playing you know, she's not having problems --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's when she comes in contact with particular things --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- so basically she has allergies that affect her breathing --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and that -- that is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really tough, and over the years -- now that she's nine years old -- they always told me that she would probably start growing out of it --
L:  Out of it, yes [NOISE].
R:  -- and she really, really has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, ah, from the time she was six months old --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- until she was five years old it was -- we always spent a week or two in the hospital a year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dealing with her allergies and she would get so bad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that her, that her lungs would be so inflamed that her blood ox would drop --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and she would end up you know, in intensive care with --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- with ah, um, you know wi- -- you know, on oxygen, in a tent and you know, trying to get her better using steroids --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and different things and, and thank god it -- as she's gotten older -- but she got stung by a bee once --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and she immediately -- her lips started turning blue and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had to use her appenafren pen and um -- get her, you know off to the doctors --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that was pret-, pretty, pretty scary, so --
L:  Oh yes, that is.
R:  So, we've got app[?] pens everywhere -- at school, at home, in my purse [LAUGH].
L:  I know, I keep saying I should, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the last time I got -- was stung was, oh god, must be ah, thirty years ago --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so, I've been lucky --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, but I keep saying -- they say each time it could get worse, you know ...
R:  Exactly, exactly.  Well, and like, you know, my husband and I, we will have been married ten years this year and we've talked about, you know -- we went on our honeymoon to Toronto and how we would love to go back --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to Toronto and take the kids and, and you know it would be nice and -- it's like well, Jessica with her lungs -- I would never want to go there -- for, for God forbid she got SARS and she died [LAUGH] you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh right, yeah definitely.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, it's like those are the things that are in the back of your mind when you have ah, you know, somebody that reacts so --
L:  I know, I know.
R:  -- incredibly to, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- I mean, we haven't had any problems in you know, several years, but we still are so, so careful.
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah, of course, of course.
R:  So, you know and it's like, you know, if Jessica ever got really sick, you know [LAUGH] mm --
L:  You don't know what you'd do.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  I mean, because, well I have six kids and ah, when my kids were small [NOISE] they were more sickly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] You know --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- from allergies --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but ah, my son had a food allergy -- he was six months old, I fed him first time 'cause  back, you know every year they change --
R:  Right.
L:  -- oh, don't feed the baby --
R:  Right, right, oh yeah.
L:  So, after six months I listened to the doctor 'cause he was sickly to begin with and ah like -- don't feed him -- so now it was time to feed him the first teaspoon of food I gave him -- my son couldn't breathe.
R:  Oh.
L:  And ah, he was in the hospital too --
R:  Oh my god.
L:  -- so -- illnesses are -- can be quite ah, horrifying, you know --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and ah, but now he outgrew it, but then, yet one time we went away to Virginia a b-, ah something flew in the window and stung him --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and ah, we had to stop at hospitals along our route to Virginia --
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  -- because his ears are swelling, his -- and ah, I tried Benadryl, I stopped at the drug store --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and gave him Benadryl, but it didn't work.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Then his ears are starting to get like, get +elongated and real red --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then we said, "Let's go to the hospital", and all they did was give him Benadryl too, but they gave it to him in a shot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it worked faster.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  You know, so you do have to watch -- it's hard.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But ah, like I say, thank god, most of my kids are big.
R:  Exactly, well my kids are seven, eight and nine and I found I -- I don't get sick half as much now as I did when they were little [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  And it seems like they were all always sick with something, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I also did daycare out of my home and I had school age children --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I always used to blame it on the kids -- the school age kids --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- bringing things home and, and then the kids would get sick and then I would get overtired from you know, being up during the night taking care of little ones and then I would get sick and it --
L:  [MN]
