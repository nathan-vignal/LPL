L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.  My name is Chris and I'm in Volda, Colorado.
L:  Hi Chris.  My name's Heather and I'm in, um, St Petersburg, Florida. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Are you on --
R:  So --
L:  -- a cell phone too? [LAUGH]
R:  I am on a cell phone and I'm cleaning my yard so my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- kids' are gonna be obtrusive.
L:  [LAUGH] Well --
R:  So we're supposed to talk about [NOISE] personal habits.  Which one is worse? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  They're all --
R:  Right?
L:  -- pretty bad. [LAUGH]
R:  I think they're all pretty bad but, um, [LIPSMACK] I think [NOISE] -- you know, [NOISE] I -- I'm -- I'm mostly concerned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with the ones that do, ah, damage to one's health. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  I -- I don't care [NOISE] about gossiping really.  I mean, I don't do it and if somebody does it against me then I guess [NOISE] it's their problem but, like, [NOISE] smoking for me is pretty bad because, you know, when you look at the statistics how many people are dying from [NOISE] lung cancer --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- these days.  It's -- it's appalling.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  And the drinking 'cause --
R:  Yes, what do you think?
L:  -- then -- well, my thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would probably be the drinking.  Excessive drinking.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Because that just [SIGH] -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cigarette smoking is bad for your health --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it's, like, when you drink it -- it affects everyone else --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- around you because you kind of change into a different person.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  And not to -- not to mention all the -- all the DUI [NOISE] cases that -- who -- you know, all the people who --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- die of -- you know, bec- -- not because it's their fault but because it's the other person's fault. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So. [NOISE]
L:  It wasn't me. [LAUGH] Ooh.
R:  Yeah.  He was playing with [NOISE] the hose and soaked himself. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Excuse me here for a second. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I am very concerned about, um, drunk driving because, um, you know, [NOISE] I've -- I've seen people, you know, [SIGH] get pretty messed up before, um, people have lost limbs out there, people are on wheelchairs, little kids are, you know -- have been affected by that.
L:  Yeah.  Their parents have -- 
R:  So.
L:  -- died or --
R:  Mm.  
L:  Right. 
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Yeah.  It's -- I don't know, it's -- it's pretty bad [NOISE] but, ah, [NOISE] I also think that it -- you know, and you probably have a lot to say about this being in Florida.  If you overeat and don't exercise, [NOISE] I also think there -- that there's a problem there.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Because, [NOISE] you know, a lot of people who -- I mean, I'm trying to lose weight and [NOISE] it's -- it's not about being the next [MN] Cindy Crawford, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not about, you know, being a model, but it's really about health, you [NOISE] know, more than anything else.  And so, if you're negligent [NOISE] about your health, then I don't think it's good for your family.  Like, I have three little kids and so I want to be [NOISE] a healthy role model for them.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  My kids --
R:  [NOISE] More than, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Go ahead. [NOISE]
L:  My parents -- I mean my house we always ate really bad.  I mean, there's always junk food and things so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I'm trying to, um, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- give a good example for my son not to eat junk [LAUGH] all the time.  'Cause, um, I'm trying to do, you know, better for myself and lose --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- weight, you know.  'Cause, like, he's three years old but I still have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- weight from him when I got pregnant, you know. [COUGH]
R:  Sure.
L:  So.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [NOISE] How old is he?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Three.
R:  He's three -- yeah.  Mine are five, three and eighteen months.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How do you -- 
R:  But, ah --
L:  -- say sane? [LAUGH]
R:  How do I say sane, huh?  I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have no idea and probably --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I have a lot of bad habits, huh [NOISE] 'cause we're talking about them.  Um, no, I don't know it's  you know, it's -- I was on birth control [LAUGH] but I guess it just happened, you know. [NOISE] On number two I was on Dasell[?], you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Dasell pro vera?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And on number three I was on, you know [NOISE]  I can't remember the name of the pills but I -- I was on the pill. [LAUGH] [NOISE] I was going through --
L:  Well, that's a really [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- a little -- I was going through a little fertility crisis, you know. [NOISE] So.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I'm okay, you know.  I'm okay.  I -- you know, I'm now thirty two --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
R:  -- so I have a lot of energy [NOISE] to take care of them and you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm taking all of these things very seriously, you know.  I'm trying to eat more fruit than vegetables and, you know, I've switched from white sugar to brown sugar and, you know, [NOISE] I'm incorporating more tofu.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know, all sorts of little things.  So --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm pretty happy.  You know, I do not smoke. [NOISE] I exercise four times a week.
L:  Wow, that's good. [NOISE] Speaking of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the little devil. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  What honey?  He's like, "Where's my mommy?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] "Close the door, honey". [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "Okay, I won't close the door". [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] Mm. [NOISE] Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Ahh. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Okay, I won't close it. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I just -- I -- I got -- I've got some really good workout tapes and I try to do them when I get home from work and --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  It's hard having a -- having a little one around to find time and -- but you have to gotta make time, you know.
R:  Yeah.  It is.  What I do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is I've brought [NOISE] one of those jogging strollers.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  So every morning, ah, I go for either a walk or a jog with the baby and the two older kids are in school [NOISE] -- preschool.
L:  Oh, are they?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's -- that's [NOISE] how I get it done, you know?
L:  Right.  I've always [NOISE] wanted --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one of those but he's old enough now where he could [NOISE] either -- you know, I could --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get somebody to watch  [NOISE] him or he could go too. [NOISE] What?
R:  Yes.  You have one of those it's [NOISE] good [NOISE] until [NOISE] the son is like five or seven [NOISE], you know?
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  So those are pretty -- pretty handy because [NOISE] you know you can sit up to a hundred pounds worth of kid in there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Wow!
R:  That's why I brought one of those. [NOISE]
L:  Wow, that's pretty good.  I wo- -- I thought that they were, you know, not that strong, but  wow.
R:  No.  They're super strong.  They're, like, a bike.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]  Huh. [NOISE]
R:  You know, I brought mine used for fifty bucks. [NOISE]
L:  Wow, that's good. [COUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Well, for fifty bucks I've got plenty of work outs you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he goes out and has a little bit of sun and, you know, fresh air, so 
L:  Uh-huh.  Do you have all boys?
R:  [NOISE] No, it's two boys and a girl in the middle. [NOISE]
L:  Ooh.  I wanna have a girl. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  And he's hinting now.  He's like, "I want a new baby". [LAUGH] But, I think he might change his mind. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  They always do, you know.  They always --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do. [NOISE]
L:  [COUGH] Mm.
R:  So, um, I don't know about what other habits to talk about -- o- other bad habits. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I couldn't really hear what they said except the ones we have to talk about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see  I d- -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Probably a good habit to have is, you know, making sure you take the time to spend time with your family, you know?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Making sure that's one of your priorities.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Which I --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I work from the home.
L:  -- really try to do 'cause --
R:  I work from the home.
L:  That's good.  Yeah.
R:  Um, so I -- I [NOISE] spend a lot of time with my kids. [NOISE]  Hold on just a second.
L:  Okay.
R:  [PAUSE] [NOISE] Do you know you guys can -- can play as much as you can, but you're gonna go inside once I'm done with the phone call.  Sorry about that. [NOISE]
L:  That's all right.
R:  So --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think, you know, spending time with the -- the kids while they're little is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is really, really [NOISE] important for them. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And for you as well because I don't know, but, you know, this whole [NOISE] business of having children is very tiring and taxing on a woman's body.
L:  You're right.  It is.
R:  So, I -- I'm actually happy [NOISE] that I can work from the home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] So, I don't know what else to say.
L:  Yeah, yeah, me too.  I'm running out of things to talk about. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you like [inaudible]? 
R:  [NOISE] Yes? [NOISE] 
L:  You do?
R:  I'm sorry, you cut off.
L:  Oh, I said, "Do you -- do you like Colorado?  Is it nice?"
R:  [NOISE]
