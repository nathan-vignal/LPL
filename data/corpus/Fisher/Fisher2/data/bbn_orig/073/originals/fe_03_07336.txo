R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  This is Ryan.  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] Pretty good.  This is Amy.
R:  Hi.  I see we have illness today. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I guess based on the question they asked us if we agree with the, um -- the saying that if you don't go to the doctor a cold takes seven days, and if you do it takes --
L:  And if -- and if you do it takes a week.  I definitely agree.
R:  Yeah.  You know, it depends.  'Cause I find that it -- ah, if I catch a cold ever way I -- I end up -- in fact I'm just getting over one now.
L: Mhm.
R:  And I've had it for about two weeks. And I think a lot has to do with, um, you know, if you're able to get the rest that you need.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  But, I don't know if a doctor would necessarily be able to help that 'cause I think that most of the things that will help you r- rid of a cold quicker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- revolve around being able to take care of yourself, and rest, and eat fruit, and having -- have a schedule that will let you take time off from work and things --
R:  Sure --
L:  -- like that.
R:  -- exactly.  And when you're working, ah, that's almost impossible. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, pretty much.
R:  You know, 'cause you could take a day or two here, but, you know, that's about it.  So, that -- really you're left on your own to, you know, eat right, and to try to get the rest you can. [COUGH]  But, if you have a stressful job that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doesn't help it either.
L:  Yeah.  That's definitely true.  Stress in general --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I'm sure tends to make it worse.
R:  Exactly.  You feel --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- worse instead of better.  Um, what I try to do to stay better is exactly what you said is to -- you know, you try to eat right, a lot of fluids.  Um, I always pump the vitamin C if I have a cold.  Um, I try to get a little extra, you know, sleep if I can.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Plus, um --
L:  [NOISE] Didn't --
R:  But, that's really --
L:  They said something about what?  A seasonal change causing --
R:  Yeah.  I guess --
L:  -- illness.
R:  -- ah, I guess I would agree with that too because when the seasons do change, especially in the spring -- 'cause I'm from New York.  And here, when the seasons change and all of the trees start to bud my allergies act up and -- and usually --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- I'm more --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- susceptible.  I don't know if that's true for you.
L:  Yeah, definitely true, although -- I don't know -- for some reason I seem to stay pretty healthy all winter, and then the spring comes and I'm sick, or the summer -- it turns to summer and I'm sick.  It's very strange.
R:  Yeah.  I hate summer colds 'cause you really feel miserable because it's hot and there's, like, no escape.
L:  Yeah.  And it seems unjustified.
R:  I know.
L:  It seems like it's not really fair that you should possibly feel ill in the summertime.
R:  Exactly.  'Cause at least in the winter it's cold.  You figure, "Well, you know, it's cold and, you know, I'm running in and out.  That's why I got a cold".  But in the summer when it's really nice and, you know -- and -- and you can't go to the beach.  You have to stay home 'cause you're sick.  I know.  It's not justified at all.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Um, what else did they ask us on the, ah ...
L:  Yeah.  Ah, [PAUSE] I think there were three things, but I can't remember the middle one.
R:  Um --
L:  The thing about, um --
R:  I know, seasonal change, if we agree with the five to seven days thing --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- with the doctor, and you're right, I can't remember what the third one was.
L:  Maybe just what you do for illness.  I mean, I don't know what you can -- like, a cold just has to run its course, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's --
R:  I mean, they --
L:  -- not like a disease that you can take medication for really.  You can --
R:  Sure, 'cause --
L:  -- beat[?] the symptoms, but --
R:  -- unless it's a -- a bacterial virus you can't take an antibiotic.
L:  Right. 
R:  But, what I do try to do -- what I find helps me if I have a cold, is I take those Coldeze lozenges.
L:  Yeah?  You think they really help?
R:  Yes, a- absolutely.  If I catch it quick enough it -- for me, it does shorten the time that I feel sick.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, the sy- symptoms don't come one so strong and, ah -- 'cause, like with this last one I didn't have any and I was just too lazy to run out and out get it.  And sore -- sure enough, this is the longest I've been sick in a long time.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  'Cause usually, you know, you get a cold -- in about a week, you know, I'm -- I'm feeling better.  This one's been dragging on for about two weeks, you know.
L:  Hm.  What do you think about all the herbal, like, preventative -- I don't know -- [NOISE] [MN] have these --
R:  Vitamins?
L:  -- different fads, like St John's Wort, and [NOISE] I don't know --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- what else they have that they try to --
R:  To boost your energy levels and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everything?
L:  They say will prevent a cold.
R:  I haven't really tried any of them.  The only -- the only big thing I've always been on is a lot of vitamin C, whether I take it in -- in a -- in a pill form or I just drink a lot of orange juice. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, I find if I do that, with a lot of water, um, usually it flushes out of my system quicker --
L:  Yeah -- yeah, definitely.  The liquids help.
R:  -- you know.  But I never tried any of the other ones.  So, have you, ah, tried any of the other ones?
L:  No I haven't.  I mean, I have a -- a friend who swears by them.  But, it seems to me they'd be very -- they prove -- they promise an awful lot without a lot of proof.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So, I'm a little skeptical of that kind of thing.  But --
R:  Th- that's how I am.  I'm not really one to jump in. Like, vitamin C they always said is a good thing, and it's -- and usually if you eat right foods you can get the vitamin C naturally.
L:  Right. 
R:  So, I've always felt better with -- with doing something like that.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause it seems like nothing bad is gonna ha- -- come from drinking too much orange juice, whereas --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- having too much of some other unknown --
R:  Yeah, well, they always warn you, like, any vitamin -- it's not good to have --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to much of any -- any of those supplements because it gets -- your body becomes too toxic with it --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- you know.  So, that's -- you know, that's the danger.  Um, but, I'm pretty fortunate.  I -- I usually get sick maybe once -- twice a year --
L:  Yeah, I'm pretty lucky too.  
R:  -- you know.  So --
L:  Although I -- I wonder if that's gonna change as I get older. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hopefully not. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hopefully.  Well, usually, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- I was -- when I was a kid I always used to get sick a lot.  But, I think it just -- you know, maybe that's why I'm not so -- I don't get sick quite so often now 'cause I got all the little childhood viruses.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, if anyone had a cold I caught it.  So I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my body has built up such a resistance that unless it's something I've really never been exposed to, you know.  But, I find that, um, I -- I -- I am -- I also try to be very careful if I know somebody has a cold and they shake my hand -- like, I --
L:  Wash your hands and --
R:  Yeah, I wash my --
L:  -- whatever.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 'Cause I'm a banker, so I deal with people, and I shake their hand all the time.  So --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- all they have to tell me is, "Oh, I'm just getting over a cold".  And as soon as they're done with me I'm off to wash my ha- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that makes sense.  Yeah, I work with, ah, school age kids, and it's also -- it seems one person in the school gets sick, everyone in the school's sick.  And --
R:  Oh sure.  If you work in the school I would think that you probably are susceptible more 'cause kids are always --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- passing on things to everybody else. 
L:  Yeah, it's great. [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, they say that a -- a new teacher -- ah, I think their first two years, they'll -- they spend more time out than in because they catch all the viruses from the little kids.
L:  Right.  And everything is [MN] -- yeah, it's that much -- that new stain of whatever for that year and that winter, and --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- you haven't built up an immunity to yet.
R:  'Cause I rem- -- I never got the chicken pox as a kid.  And, um, I was with -- one Christmas I was spending some time with some friends of mine and their little girl had it, or was incubating it.  And sure enough, I got the chicken pox.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And they're -- you know -- ah, and I was an adult when I got it.  I was in, like, -- I think I was, what?  Twenty -- twenty three.
L:  Oh. [MN]
R:  So, I never got it as a little kid.  I got it as an adult because this little girl was [LAUGH] -- got it from --
L:  That must have been terrible.  It's supposed to be worse as you get older.
R:  Ah, well, it ju- -- it wasn't [MN] -- it wasn't too, too bad.  It's just -- um, you know, it was -- ah, you know, it's annoying 'cause you're very itchy and everything. You just have --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- to be careful.  I think -- I forgot what they told me.  There's something with -- with scarring you have to be careful of.    
L:  Right.
R:  The only thing they told me is that, um, if it -- if I were to ever get shingles it would be much later in life because it usually has to stay dormant in your system for a long time --
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  -- you know.  So, they told me that's the only plus of getting it older is that if it -- if I were to ever get it, it probably wouldn't happen 'til much later.  I said, "Well, I --"
L:  Well, I guess that's food.
R:  "-- don't know if that's a -- a good thing" because --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, to be, you know, in your seventies or eighties and then all of a sudden --
L:  Yeah, no thanks.
R:  -- you know, break out in shingles.  That could be really torture.
L:  Definitely.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  So, um, I'm trying to think what else.  Um --
L:  I feel like illness is something that people complain about so much. [MN] It's such a large topic of conversation. But, I can't think of anything else to say about it.
R:  I know.  Exactly, you know.  'Cause it's -- [MN] -- ah, I did one other call with them, and they don't give enough -- I mean, here at least they gave us three things to think about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The last time I think it was on, um, pets.  And they didn't even, like, ask you, like, what type of pets you have or whatever.  But, um, they gave, like, one little question and you had to spend ten --
L:  Jeeze.
R:  -- minutes talking about [LAUGH] --
L:  Like, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pets are --
R:  What do --
L:  -- good.
R:  What do you talk about next? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, seriously.
R:  You know?  But, um -- but, like I said, I rarely -- ah, I rarely get very sick.  And that's the other thing too, is when I do get sick it's just -- um, it's usually just annoying enough to slow me down, but not --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- but not where I really have to stay home and be in bed --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- you know.  Um --
L:  Yeah, which is [LAUGH] --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- I guess it's good that you don't miss time out of what you're doing, but it's pretty horrible for --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, sometimes I m- -- you know, I might take a day just because I figure, "You know what?  If I don't take this day now, um, it's just --"
L:  You'll be --
R:  "-- gonna get --"
L:  -- sick for weeks.
R:  "-- worse".  And, you know -- so I -- but, sometimes I really don't need to do that, you know.  It's funny, my mother's very sick now too.  She and I must have caught the same cold at the same --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- time.  And she's a lot worse than I am.  She's -- she's dealing with -- um, she -- she has to stay in bed.  But, you know, she's a senior citizen, so she -- so her resistance would be lower than mine.  So, she -- she has to spend more time recuperating, where I -- I can kind of bounce back pretty quickly.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  Well, that's definitely good.
R:  You know?
L:  Less of a nuisance --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- that way.
R:  -- 'cause I always try and avoid people when I have a cold [several inaudible words] end up giving it to everybody [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, let's see, what else can we talk about?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, [LAUGH] um, trying to --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- I -- one of the other things -- I know we talked about herbal remedies, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I find that some of the over the counter, ah, medications do make the symptoms subside, l- like --
L:  Yeah.  And I guess with a cold all you can do is treat the symptoms anyway, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you might as well lessen your pain and -- and do that.
R:  Like, I -- sometimes what's -- what I do sometimes is I -- there's a Theraflu[?] for, ah, cold and flu.
L:  Yeah, I decided that worked really well.  They had something --
