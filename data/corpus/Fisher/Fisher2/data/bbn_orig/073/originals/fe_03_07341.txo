R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Sarah.
L:  My name is Teresa.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  So -- so, this whole illness thing -- I completely get sick every time the seasons change.
L:  I get sick when the weather changes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the season -- I have allergies, I have a [inaudible], and I live like, right by a whole bunch of azalea bushes, I'm allergic to those --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- it does not help if you take medicine before you get sick, after you get sick or while you are sick, you're still going to stay sick.
R:  Yep, so, allergy medicine doesn't help you?
L:  Nope.
R:  [MN] I mean [several inaudible words]
L:  Have I tried what?
R:  You know that nose spray they have now, it's um --
L:  I can't use nasal sprays 'cause if I use them they drain down the back of my throat and it makes me gag and puke.
R:  Yep.  My friend used to get bloody noses randomly when she just -- she'd be sitting still reading a book or something and she'd get a nose bleed from that [inaudible].
L:  Yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the best, the best thing I've found up to now is the Allegra --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- or Tylenol, the Tylenol Sinus and Allergy -- that's about the only two things I've found up to now that's really worked.
R:  See I -- I thought I had allergies this season but I really think it was a cold because it just kinda went away, but I don't know, since I've never had allergies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I don't know.
L:  You can go the doctor and get tested for allergies, though.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I thought about that, but I -- I really don't want to be -- I don't want to take medicine anyway, 'cause it always makes me really drowsy.
L:  I really don't take it 'cause I can't ever remember to take it all.
R:  Mm.
L:  You get put on something like penicillin or something like that, and you don't finish your whole prescription --
R:  I never do.
L:  -- and you then sick -- you get sicker the next time around -- when they give it to you the medicine makes you sick as well as being sick.
R:  Yep.
L:  -- 'cause it like -- they killed my son 'cause he got, um, pneumonia --
R:  Oh god.
L:  -- from being sick -- he had a cold and then he caught pneumonia from it and they gave him penicillin and then he didn't -- he didn't take his last three doses and the next time they gave it to him, it made him sick.
R:  That's it -- yeah -- that's one of the reasons why I don't like going to the doctor, so if I -- if I get sick, especially if it's just a head cold or something --
L:  You pay a thousand dollars just to get two pills to make you sicker [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well I mean what are you going to do with that anyway you know -- it's a head cold -- you can't take medicine, like, antibiotics to make it any better.
L:  Yeah, you just --
R:  I don't think so.
L:  -- wait it out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And go take a hot shower and just get all the steam so it gets all the mucus out of your nose and face, and you'll just be better.
R:  Yeah, yep, so I'm not a big doctor goer or anything like that [MN].
L:  Don't like doctors, they stab needles in you -- sick or not, and --
R:  I don't -- yeah, yeah --
L:  I been --
R:  -- I don't mind the whole needle thing, it's just taking medicine -- it always makes me feel worse than when I did before.
L:  I went to the emergency room because I got, um, with my allergies -- and they ended up giving three shots for my allergies and they didn't do nothing for it -- all it did was numb both my legs and my arm.
R:  [MN] Did they give you like Benadryl or something?
L:  I have no idea what they got me -- I was like half dead and dehydrated when I went there -- so they're just stabbing me and stuff randomly.
R:  Oh man.
L:  Huh, I didn't even know --
R:  You didn't --
L:  -- I just kind of woke up really sore and just [LAUGH] had bandaids on me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What's up?  It wasn't that fun.
R:  Mm, it's always something.
L:  I know it man -- always give you something to make you sicker -- and it doesn't help when you got kids who are in school 'cause they bring home sicknesses too --
R:  [several inaudible words], yeah.
L:  Yeah, you keep bringing your kid home and it's sick, or you keep your child home 'cause it's sick and somebody else sends their child in, so that means you got your kid home well -- the -- getting well, and go back to school and they get sick, so you get the whole family sick again too.
R:  Mhm, so that --
L:  It's like pointless --
R:  -- no, it doesn't help, 'cause I always think, you know, I -- I never really got sick as a child, but if I was sick my mom would keep me home.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  'Cause there's no sense in spreading it to everyone else.
L:  In most rules now, like most daycares and schools --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- is that you're supposed to keep a child home if, if they've had a fever within twenty four hours, even if it's for teething or anything like that, just to make sure they -- it get --  cuts the illnesses and sicknesses down, but nobody ever does it 'cause they just want their kids out of their hair, so they send 'em to school anyway.
R:  Well, we usually stay home from work, you know.
L:  Yeah, I us- -- was like -- what you gotta spend some time with your child -- you gonna miss a whole day of what school mind warping?
R:  Yeah, right [LAUGH].
L:  Right.  You see, they -- kids going to feel better if they stay off anyway, I mean, they're, they're going to get everybody else sick so they don't catch it again in two more weeks.
R:  Yep, yep -- actually, my roommate worked at a, she worked at a residential house for kids with like, um, mental behavioral problems --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she brought something home every week.
L:  Damn.
R:  Every week she brought something home, I mean, and all of a sudden I'd often get it too and what do you do?  You try to stay away from her --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like you know, like get out of the room that I'm in, you know, wash your hands extra, it doesn't help -- just breathing air in the winter.
L:  I have -- I live in a house with like, I'm like um -- rent my own house and I have like, a few other people staying here with me --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I m-, a eleven month old baby with me and Lysol everything down and you still get sick.
R:  Yeah, well yeah.
L:  It's no matter what you do -- I've tried wip- -- you name it, I'm like one of those -- it comes out and it says "New -- kills bacteria", 'cause I'm a new mom, I go out and just get it and it hopefully it works, and it does not work, you still get sick --
R:  Right.
L:  It doesn't matter -- the weather still changes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're still going to sick from -- it rains -- it's gonna water the pollen down and dump it all over you, or the sun's gonna make all the flowers bloom so you get sick from that, or ...
R:  See, I just moved to a city about a year ago and I used to live out in the middle of nowhere, like forty acre farmland, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that sort of thing -- I never got sick, but now that I live in the city, you know --
L:  It's all the pollution and stuff.  I liv- -- I moved from England, to um, Wisconsin and I was fine until I actually moved down to Florida, actually in the city area, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- when I moved into Wisconsin I was out in the open and in England where I lived, I was like out in the open, like fields -- there's no town, city like pollution --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since I got around all the pollution, and stuff that's when I actually started getting sick -- and I -- it's not the fact of not hanging around people, it's living in the -- it's living in the city makes you sicker than living out in the country, because of all the extra pollution --
R:  It does.
L:  -- they have in the air.
R:  It does, it does.  I've noticed a huge difference, a huge difference.
L:  'Cause it's just like -- all the other people and then you got all the other extra cars and they don't have all the trees and nature and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stuff to suck out all the dirty out of the air.  That's why you're supposed to have like lin- -- we usually have like plants in our house, like a lot of live plants in our house to suck out all the dirtiness --
R:  Does it help?
L:  -- yeah actually it does.
R:  Does it?
L:  Yeah, if you get like, little like rubber plants and dumb -- like little --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dumb plants people put throughout their houses --
R:  Stuff that's hard to kill.
L: Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They get -- it's -- it --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it cleans the air out a lot better for you too, it makes it a lot healthier for you to breathe in -- then -- and if you frigging -- I took out the carpet and put -- most people don't like it, but I took out all my carpet and put down lino and tiles throughout my whole house --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because the carpet actually holds more bacteria and mould and germs and stuff from people tromping through it from outside, than anything else in your house.
R:  Yes.
L:  And it's really a bad breeding ground for a lot of germs and sicknesses -- you, you think somebody walks -- if you have your kid on that ground that somebody's going to walk through, how many parking lots, yards, places, businesses --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- where everybody else has walked before [NOISE] and then you -- it's all that dirt is right there on your floor and then you --
R:  Public restrooms, you know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- disgusting -- no, every time I look for a new place to live I always -- I always look for um -- I always make sure that it, that it doesn't have carpet, and, and sometimes people are like, "Oh, well it's brand new, or it's clean, or ..." -- it's not going to be for long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can only do so much with carpet, you know -- I want hardwood floors or linoleum so I can mop it and scrub it.
L:  Hardwood floors are the best, that's what they invented the Swiffer Mop for -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], that thing's great -- we have one.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's nice. [NOISE]
L:  Gets up everything -- a wet cloth to suck everything up -- you don't gotta bend over, no bucket, no nothing --
R:  No.
L:  -- cleans all your dirt away.
R:  I was in -- I -- I learned a new way to mop too, the other day -- you know how the mop handle will come off?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like -- on screws --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there was this lady in the store and she was telling me about -- she was old -- she was like, "You wanna know how I mop?", I'm like, "Yeah, I wanna know how you mop ...", 'cause you know, old people always know the best way to do stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was ah um, ah if you get one of those utility brushes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the hole in 'em you just screw the handle in and scrub with that and then use an old towel for your mopping 'cause then you can just wash the towel.
L:  Yeah, what I usually do is ah -- we've got a um, Re- Resolve I think is the name brand of um, it's for car- -- scrubbing things in your carpet -- they give you this little red carpet brush that goes with it --
R:  Yes, I've seen that.
L:  -- and it screws right onto your -- like you say, your mop handle --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  -- I've scrubbed my whole house, I scrub my outside of my house with that -- I scrub my inside floors with that and I do the towel thing, too -- I have -- I go down to Helping Hand and get like, old towels or sheets or stuff and just use that to mop my floor up with --
R:  You do that?
L:  -- [several inaudible words] 'cause you can actually in -- if I really want to get playful I actually lay my son down on it sometimes, after like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's cleaned up --
R:  And let him run on it.
L:  -- and it's nice and shiny and clean, you get your son and you get him on a towel and pull him around on it -- he loves it [LAUGH].
R:  Oh sure.
L:  [MN]
R:  [PAUSE]  Well I think that -- I think -- I've found that it's a lot better way to keep clean, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- 'cause I've got animals too, so --
L:  Yeah, I have um, a dog and two cats that run around here and it keeps it a lot cleaner for them too because when they come in and they shake off all their dirt and fleas --
R: Yeah.
L: -- and all other lovely gifts that animals give you when you don't let 'em out at four o'clock in the morning --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- [LAUGH] and [LAUGH], and it's a lot better than carpet, because it's a lot easier to clean up off of plastic than it is carpet, 'cause it soaks down into your carpet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's dirty.  I have a really old dog and he's one of those ones that you have to let him out when he tells you -- he, he -- it's gotta go, that mean he has to go [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] And the saddest thing is, is he's got allergies too, we have to give him Benadryl.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, no -- [several inaudible words].
L:  He's always [inaudible] ...
