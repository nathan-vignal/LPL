R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Christa.
R:  My name is Linda.
L:  Hello, Linda.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  So, the topic is the seasons are changing and that people generally get sick when the seasons change?
R:  That's basically it, yeah.
L:  And then, ah, do we believe --
R:  How do we keep ourselves, and do we think going to the doctor helps?
L:  And also, do you believe that, ah, a cold lasts a week or it lasts seven days regardless of whether you go to the doctor or not?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Actually --
L:  So 
R:  -- the last one, I think, is probably about right.  Certainly with the ones like a cold where it's a virus and so they can't do anything for you anyway.
L:  Yeah, I don't typically [NOISE] go to the doctor for -- for a cold either [SIGH] because it doesn't seem to make a difference because --
R:  No.
L:  -- they can't really do anything for you.  But it does seem though, that some of the viruses are lasting longer than just a week these -- these days.  I don't know if it's just me or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if things are 
R:  Well, I think it's supposed to be seven to ten days.  Right, it's supposed to take seven to ten days to get it, and seven to ten days to get over it and then there's -- I find there's at least another week of just trying to get your system back.
L:  Yeah, so it's -- so it's really more like a month [LAUGH] -- a month long process.
R:  [LAUGH] It can be.
L:  It can be.  So --
R:  [several inaudible words] had a cold in a while.
L:  -- what -- what part of the country are you in?
R:  Once I got my kids through, which is preschool, I haven't been getting sick lately.
L:  Yeah, it does make a big difference I think --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
L:  You know, this -- I'm not talking -- ah, can, ah, -- does that sound better?
R:  It's better.
L:  It's -- it's just this old -- it's like the plug in phone when the electricity goes out and you need a phone.  But my son picked up the phone --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and he doesn't -- he doesn't get the -- the automatic recorded voice.  He's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- expecting someone to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- talk to him and tell him who to talk to so 
R:  I got the cutest -- um, my -- we're having a birthday party -- completely off topic -- but -- and our kindergartner called to say that she's coming.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And so I get this total silence in the background and I'm saying, "I- is that the machine?  Did you get the machine? [LAUGH] Just talk to it". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "It's for Mummy, it doesn't say anything back". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  So, ah, --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I guess having kids around makes you more, ah, susceptible to colds 'cause they seem to bring everything home and 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  So you -- you have a kindergartner then?
R:  I have a kindergartner and a fifth grader.  
L:  Oh, wow.  You're, ah 
R:  And, ah, yeah, the latest around here is a version of strep where all you get is a stomach ache and a fever.
L:  Oh, that's odd.
R:  You don't get a sore throat, you don't -- I guess you might get the -- the marks inside your mouth but I'm not sure. [PAUSE] Um 
L:  And, what part of the --
R:  Although I think -- I think my daughter had them inside her neck when she had it. [MN]
L:  So what part of the state are you in -- or the US?
R:  Um, I'm in Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, okay.  And I'm in California.
R:  Okay so --
L:  So, we're the opposite -- opposite sides of the --
R:  -- you probably won't catch it off of us.
L:  -- country. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Or through --
L:  Hope not.  That would be, ah -- that would be very odd.  Through the phone wires.
R:  There you go.  There you go.
L:  So have you participated in many of these calls?
R:  [SIGH] This is my third.
L:  Third.  Mine as well.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, ah, I -- I seem to have missed a lot.  I gave a timeframe and just have been really busy and not -- not been around to accept my calls.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I -- I had this -- I s- -- a very limited times I'm available on cell and so, of course, that's the phone they picked for me.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] So it's --
L:  So your on your cell phone --
R: -- basically once a week they get a chance of me being on the cell phone.
L:  And, you're going to a meeting or  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm, you know -- I'm -- I'm --
L:  On your route somewhere.
R:  -- driving anyway and so I may as well do a call -- stop on the road and do a call.
L:  That's good.
R:  But, kind of weird.
L:  So, do -- do you think, ah, living in different climates affects the -- your -- your immune system, like being in a colder climate versus a warmer climate?
R:  Well, I think -- I -- certainly we find for the cold it makes everybody stay inside and so, you get some people who are just sick all winter because people keep sneezing on them.
L:  Right.  They're just in -- in infected air.
R:  You can't -- you can't escape basically, --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- any of the airborne anything.  Um, and then, I know in spring --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I'm looking at like my windshield, and there's this incredible line of yellow where I keep wiping all the pollen off, but --
L:  So it's just in the air?
R:  -- it's unbelievably in the air.  I have to wipe off the windshield every time I get back in the car.  I've --
L:  You must --
R:  -- driven some place four times today and I --
L:  Now, do you park under a --
R:  -- and the windshields just gross every time.
L:  Do you park under a tree that has something on it or is --
R:  No.
L:  -- the car in a garage?
R:  Last time I was inside a parking garage.  There's just so much of it blowing in the air this time of year.
L:  Wow, that's weird.
R:  It's got to affect your ability to fight off real diseases to have all this other stuff in your lungs.
L:  So they -- I think over time maybe people even develop allergies because they've had, ah, -- they're just more and more exposed to it and they're just -- body just can't fight it off --
R:  Yeah, I think that's true.
L:  -- after so many years and years of trying and 
R:  Although I think, my allergy week tends to be fairly early in the season.  I think I figured out it's the maple trees.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And, come to think of it we don't have very many maple trees where I grew up and up here, you know with the maple syrup and all that, we've got tons of them and, ah 
L:  So your allergies are worse in your new home.
R:  So my allergies are worse but we went on a week's vacation the week the +maple -- maple trees all bloomed.  Not that you could see the flowers but they have them anyway.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, so I managed to skip it this time. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, see again --
R:  Which was pretty good.
L:  -- that -- that leads us into our next topic of discussion -- how do you, ah, stay healthy and I think going on vacation --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- at the time that [LAUGH] the maple trees [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- bloom --
R:  I usually don't get to do it that way but it worked this time.
L:  -- is your, ah, solution.  That's a good one.  I, ah -- I -- I've come to getting into taking vit- -- ah, echinacea.  Have you ever tried that for when you start a cold coming on?  And, ah --
R:  You know, never consistently enough that I could blame the cold on whether or not I'd taken it right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I think it actually does help --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- shorten the, ah, symptoms or lessen the symptoms too -- it kind of dries you out in a way it doesn't  
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Now, that'd be good.  So, do you drink it as a tea or do you take it as a pill or --
L:  I actually just take it as a tablet, like a vitamin.  I get it at the phar- -- Lon- -- we have Longs as a big like pharmacy like kind of store.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or, we have Trader Joes.  You guys have Trader Joes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Trader Joes is -- is a good place to get it.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And zinc is -- zinc is good too for colds.  Lessens --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- the -- the effects of them. [PAUSE] [NOISE] So is school out -- out there for --
R:  Gosh no --
L:  -- every ?
R:  -- we've got another full week.
L:  Oh, gosh.  Well, the -- tom- -- Fri- -- this Friday is our last day so everyone's having their end of year parties and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wrapping up.  I got -- I have two kids as well, a kin- -- a second grader and a kinderg- -- or an eig- -- spit it out, Christa, a fifth grader.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, all the bags of homework, you know, workbooks --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- coming home and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- everything.
R:  The, ah --
L:  It's kind of hectic.
R:  I was just at my second grade godson's, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were doing -- they're doing westwood expansion and so everyone dresses up in [inaudible] bonnets and cowboy hats, and there's a little log cabin house for the Wilders or just Luthen Clark or [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, that's cute.
R:  -- one of those.  Yeah, it's very cute.  Of course none of the kids look sick so that was okay.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  To get back to your topic again. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, really.  May- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Maybe we get docked points if we don't stay on topic.
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure. [LAUGH] Well --
L:  Won't -- won't send us any payment.  I haven't gotten any payment, I don't know about you.
R:  Oh.  I decided it wasn't worth trying to figure out how to declare it.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not even --
R:  So, I wimped out.
L:  -- collect it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it's a --
R:  But, um 
L:  -- it's an interesting scenario to put two people that don't know each other at all on the phone and -- I've talked to someone from Texas and someone from North Carolina and it's --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- kind of int- -- it's interesting.
R:  I think I've talked to somebody from Virginia and somebody from Arizona.
L:  I keep on feeling like at sometime it's going to be someone that I [LAUGH] know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the other line somehow.  
R:  It's possible.
L:  'Cause you know it --
R:  Although they seem to be making them geographically separate.  But then --
L:  Maybe that's the intent.
R:  -- we all have some connection that lead us here so, it's a tight enough community we might know it anyway.
L:  Yeah.  That would -- that would be -- we have a connection in the east coast.  We have a -- a summer home in New Hampshire -- it would be funny to get someone on the --
