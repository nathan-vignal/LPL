R:  Neil [inaudible].  Hello.
L:  Hello?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi, what's your name?
R:  Neil.
L:  I'm Carly.
R:  Hello.  
L:  So what you got?  What's your favorite thing?
R:  Um, well, I don't knows.  I prefer eating at home 'cause I like the peace and quiet of home, uh, uh, really rather than, like, the busyness of the restaurant.  Uh--
L:  Yeah, but you know sometimes it's nice to go out.  I mean, do you prefer eating at home, like preparing it yourself or having --
R:  Oh, no, no, no.
L:  -- someone cook for you at home?  Oh, I see.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, yeah.  So once in a while I like to go out but most of the time I like the peace and quiet of home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I definitely like going out.  Well, are there a lot of good restaurants near you?
R:  No, not really.
L:  Oh, see you live like rural area?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Like, I'm in the big city so --
R:  Oh, okay, well.
L:  -- going out to eat is -- it's key[?].  Like --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I don't know.  It's good to cook for yourself at home I think, but you can really get different, I mean, different, like, ethnic --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- foods especially.
R:  That's right.  That's true.
L:  That you can't get at home.
R:  No.
L:  Like I could try to cook Indian food at home on my own but I'm sure it wouldn't be have as good as the stuff I can get --
R:  Probably not.
L:  -- out when I eat, you know.
R:  But the thing is, like, to get to the nearest restaurant it takes like forty five minutes so ...
L:  Oh, it's rough.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's rough.
L:  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]  So what's your favorite meal?  Like, describe your favorite favorite meal. 
R:  I really don't have a favorite.  I have like -- I really don't know.  
L:  No?  Nothing you -- you [MN] --
R:  No idea.
L:  If you had -- what would be your last meal?  If you couldn't eat another meal in your entire life.
R:  [several inaudible words]. 
L:  If it was the last thing, what would it be?
R:  I -- I'd have Easy Mac.  I'd have macaroni and cheese.
L:  Easy Mac or macaroni and cheese?  There's a very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- big difference.
R:  Well, macaroni and cheese.
L:  Okay.  
R:  What about you?
L:  My favorite -- my -- if I had to have my last meal, mm.  Honestly, I think it would be a whole apple pie and a gallon of vanilla ice cream.
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN]
L:  Yeah, that sounds about right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's good stuff.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or maybe, mm.  I don't know.  Something my grandmother would make.  Like something huge.  Like a four course meal with everything so I wouldn't miss out on anything.
R:  True.  True.  'Cause it is your last meal.  
L:  Right.  It's important, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I was reading, actually, a -- a whole article on the last meals of prisoners.  Like what they request on death row.  
R:  Right.
L:  I know it's really morbid but, like, the ratio of fried chicken was incredible.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  People were, like, frying whole chickens and eating --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- them whole.  Then there was --
R:  That's really nasty.
L:  -- always the poor sap that asked for something and they denied it and just, like, gave them a hamburger or something.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Which would be terrible.  I mean, imagine, your last meal --
R:  That sucks.
L:  -- on earth and you get some sketchy hamburger.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That sucks.  
L:  Oh, what else?  Hm.  I don't know, man.  I don't have much to say about food.  Do you?
R:  Not really.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Hm.
R:  [MN]  What do you think about food?  Is it more of a necessity than a want?
L:  I think it's totally desirable.  It's one of my favorite things in the world.
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't get people -- like, I [MN] -- I --I totally sympathize with anyone who has eating disorders or weight issues but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think if denying yourself food is just -- it's odd.
R:  It's wrong.  That's wrong.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just [MN] so good.  It's the --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- best stuff in the world.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Nobody cares if you're a little chunky.  I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, really.  
L:  -- just like eat it.  It's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, I don't know.  I went to, uh, South America to visit my family and I saw --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I went down there and everyone's just like -- I was like the skinniest thing walking around.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I was like damn I feel good, [LAUGH] you know.  
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  Feed me more.  I think it's okay.  I think food -- it shouldn't be like a crutch.  Like people that overeat.
R:  Yeah. I mean --
L:  Because I think too much of anything is very bad but it's definitely something [inaudible] --
R:  You can't just like eat and just sit around all day but ...
L:  Yeah, right.  And also I think it's important not to limit yourself to what you eat, I think.
R:  Right.
L:  Trying a lot of things is very important and, uh --
R:  Being open minded is great.
L:  Right.  I mean there's some stuff that's just nasty.  But --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Use your commonsense.  But --
R:  Well, edible food, I mean.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And it's surprising, like things you wouldn't think would be yummy at all turn out to be the greatest --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- stuff in the world.  Although I definitely draw the line on stuff that's still moving.  
R:  Mm.
L:  That's a little gross.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
L:  Mm.  Alligator.
R:  Alligator?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, how was that?
L:  It tasted like chicken to use -- to beat the dead horse.  I mean it's -- it's like any kind of meat, I guess, like --
R:  Okay.
L:  It's -- it's kind of chewy and -- and -- but not like gamy like rabbit or deer or like -- it -- it was just, like, good.
R:  Okay.
L:  And [MN] -- I have an uncle that works in a seafood restaurant and he, like, they catch them [LAUGH] and like --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- got 'em and fry 'em up.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And they're like little -- like little chicken nuggets only --
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  -- alligator [LAUGH] nuggets.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  So, [inaudible] -- like you wouldn't -- you wouldn't [NOISE] know the difference if no one told you?
L:  No, you'd just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- think it was some kind of, like, random fritter.
R:  [NOISE]  I see.  
L:  What about you?  What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
R:  Me?  I've eaten an eel.  That's about it.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, eel is good though.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it is pretty good.
L:  There's, um, a kind of sushi called --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Anagi[?] and it's just like -- it's eel.  It's all, mm.  It's like good.  You wouldn't think, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  But it's just -- there's some --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- things that just -- they're all smokey and yummy and ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  I was pretty surprised when I tasted it.  It's pretty good actually.
L:  Mhm.  How 'bout --
R:  So --
L:  Oh.  What's your favorite, mm, a favorite dessert?  How's that?  'Cause my apple pie cancelled that 'cause I don't consider that as dessert.  I see it as a whole meal.
R:  My favorite dessert?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh ...  Uh, cheesecake.  
L:  Oh, good call.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Cheesecake is definitely the superior food.
R:  Yes.  
L:  I had, um -- I was cooking for this big party and we made --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- eleven cheesecakes.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And just we had a bowl the size --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- of a satellite dish. 
R:  Right.
L:  And we just made the batter all in one big bowl and then --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- divvied it up into little pans.  It was a -- a vat of cheesecake.  Like --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you could've swum in it.  And it was just full of --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- chocolate chip --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, like, amaretto and [LAUGH] ...
R:  Wow.
L:  It was -- it was, oh, oh, man.  [LAUGH]  It was --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- really good stuff.  Okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe I'd lay down my life for cheesecake over apple pie.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  I think my favorite dessert, like, just to have a nice dessert after a meal might be like a good piece of dark chocolate and a cup of coffee.  
R:  Mm.  It's a good choice.
L:  It's a good way to, like, end the meal.
R:  End the meal, yeah.
L:  It's like a pallet cleanser almost. 
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Because you -- you -- dessert as much as --
R:  Putting a cap on things.
L:  -- as much as I love it, dessert is one thing you should not have way too much of.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.
L:  Because it can get really dangerous [LAUGH] really fast.
R:  Right.  And then you're not going to be able to sleep for hours.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, I've eat a whole pumpkin pie af- after --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Thanksgiving.  Like, I've been there, it's not pretty.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think small sweets are the best way to go.
R:  Right.
L:  And God knows I love cheesecake but I can't have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- one piece of it.  I will --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- gorge myself until it's coming out of my ears.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  As is often the case.  
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess [several inaudible words] for the coffee though.  That's pretty good.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Good coffee is key.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's hard to get, like, good coffee in America though, and good chocolate.
R:  Ew, yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, we -- we just like --
R:  It is pretty hard.
L:  -- bastardize it.  [LAUGH]  It's all like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Hersheys, Milky Way bars.  That's not chocolate.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's something else.
L:  It's candy.  It's candy.  
R:  Right.
L:  You gotta go and get like the -- the ninety nine --
R:  Chocolate chocolate.
L:  -- percent cocoa, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- burn your tongue
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- dark chocolate.  Even like a brick of baker's chocolate will do at a pinch.  You just hack it off --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with a knife [LAUGH] and gnaw on it.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  It'll make you ill [LAUGH] though.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Mm.  Oh, man, I'm hungry.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  I just ate.
L:  Easy.  What did you eat today?
R:  Today?
L:  Yes. 
R:  Well, today I went to Taco Bell.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I had -- uh, with my friends I had a Mexican pizza and an order of nachos.  
L:  Fair enough.  Was that all you ate today?
R:  Yeah, that's all I had.
L:  Okay, what did I eat today?  I had a bowl of cereal.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And some cherries and Puerto Rican rice and beans for dinner.
R:  It's all good[?].
L:  Which was damn good.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mommy made it.  There's a big old pot of them --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- sitting in my fridge.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.  Do you prefer, like, traditional American food or do you like ethnic foods?  Like, I don't know what -- what your ethnic background is, if it's like a strong thing or if you're many generations removed [inaudible].
R:  No, I'm like -- uh, I'm like all different, yeah.
L:  You're a mutt?
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I don't know, I just like to try new things.  
L:  Right.
R:  Can't stick to one thing forever.  
L:  See, I'm like really -- I like -- we have a lot of, like -- I'm like seventh generation on one side and first on the other.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, but, uh [LAUGH] the one side really hung on to it.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So I've got very, like, clear ideas about what Polish cooking should be like and --
R:  I see.
L:  -- you don't think Polish people -- they know how to cook, man, let me tell you.
R:  Right.
L:  And then -- so you get like -- okay, perfect example.  The +Pirogi --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or a Pirogi[?] to the rest --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- of America.  These little doughy --
R:  Right
L:  -- pasta things.  I go to, like, the dining hall at school and they're serving it up with salsa and nacho cheese and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- olives.  I'm like, that's like putting horseradish on a [inaudible].  
R:  Right.
L:  You can't do it.
R:  Right.
L:  It's -- this is something that's meant to be consumed with sour cream and apple [LAUGH] sauce and nothing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- else.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It was an abomination.  But you have to think, like, foods that were ethnic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fifty years ago, like, look at lasagna, spaghetti.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like that's -- that's been so Americanized.
R:  Right.  Yeah, it's [inaudible] changing like over.
L:  And not like two generations ago that was ethnic food.
R:  Right.
L:  Like only Italians ate it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Only Italians cooked it.  Now, like, Joe Schmo --
R:  It's just like  --
L:  -- down the block --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  -- is feeding it to his pack of Irish kids and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] nobody thinks anything of it, you know.  
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  I mean, in a way it's a good thing though 'cause like more people can get it, but I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the people -- the people -- like, the -- the people -- the ethnic group that it's from, I mean, they probably think it's, like, completely different.
L:  Yeah.  It's totally different.
R:  Yeah.  Mm.
L:  I mean if you've ever had, like, a good pot of sauce cooked by, like, someone's grandmother who really knows how to do it --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah. 
L:  -- it's a completely different experience than --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something you get out of a can.  [LAUGH]  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's just no comparing the two.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Oh, I think our time might be up.  
R:  Really?
L:  [inaudible] I think so.  I don't know if they tell us when
