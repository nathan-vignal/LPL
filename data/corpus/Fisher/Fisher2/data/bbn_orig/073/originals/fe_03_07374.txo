R:  My name is Gloria Watkins.
L:  Hi, my name is Amy Fetters[?].
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Is this the first time you've done this?
R:  Yes.
L:  The same on this end.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from, um, Sugar Run, PA.
L:  Oh, really, I'm down in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you're not having all the rain we're having.
L:  No.  Well, actually, we've been having rain every day but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it only last about two hours and then it's gone for the day.  It's not too bad, but we definitely need it as hot as it is down here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How is the weather up there besides that?
R:  Ah, it's rained, I think, eighteen days out of the last twenty two.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  That's --
R:  There's --
L:  -- a lot of rain.
R:  -- been a shower or it has rained all day or drizzled.
L:  Ah, that's not good.
R:  There's something about I'm supposed to have a pin number, I don't quite understand that.
L:  Um, I think in your email you were supposed to get sent a pin -- a pin number and that way you can refer people.  Let me see, 'cause I've been looking in my email but I didn't even notice anything that came from them at all yet, they said that we would get the email and it would have the pin numbers in there to access everything.
R:  I checked a while ago and I didn't ge- -- have an email then.
L:  Yeah, I don't see anything that I'm looking in here, nothing whatsoever, which is really weird.  When did you sign up?
R:  Couple of hours ago.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH] And you're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- already doing your first phone call.  I signed up yesterday.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, ah, how did you find out about it?
R:  Um, I am a refunder and I go into the refunding sites on the net --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I really enjoy it.  Um, I'm not working right now, I'm having a lot of back problems and will probably have to have surgery --
L:  Ooh, not good.
R:  -- ah, my hands are not working very well, they feel heavy and I'm going to get an MRI on Tuesday --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, it is sometimes even hard to type.  I'm slow at it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it gives me something to do and right now I have to use a walker because I've -- my legs have given out and I fell --
L:  Ooh --
R:  -- several times.
L:  -- that's not good.
R:  No.  I have degenerative arthritis and a --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- couple of bulging disks so --
L:  Ah, I hope they can fix all that when they do the MRI.
R:  Oh, I hope -- I hope so too.  I'm sixty years old and I'm not -- I can't retire yet.
L:  Hey, you don't sound sixty.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I am.
L:  Not at all.  How many kids do you have?
R:  I have three.
L:  You have three.  I've got two, I've got a son, ah, Darren, he'll be fr- -- ah, one years old on July first, and then I've got a daughter, Laurel, she'll be five on, ah, November sixteenth.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I've got little ones, I'm only thirty.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, well, I'm twice your age and, ah, my oldest one is a boy, he's thirty seven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my daughter's thirty five --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and my youngest son is thirty one.
L:  Oh, that's cool though, that's not far out from my ages.
R:  No, and I live, um, close to my daughter that has --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the two little grandchildren, Caitlin is four and Brenda -- ah, Brandon is two.
L:  Oh, close --
R:  This --
L:  -- to my son and my daughter.
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, that's really nice.  The little ones are great.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I --
L:  It's when --
R:  We lived up here, um -- we used to live an hour away from here, and we moved up here so we could, um, spoil them.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] grandparents are great at that though.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know that with my grandmother and everything.  She's a great grandmother now so she loves the grandchildren.  She just sits there and spoils them rotten and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- right now it's pretty quiet around here 'cause I actually sent them up to my dad's, which is up in, um, like, the pan handle of Florida --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- up north further for a week.  He's got five acres with cows and chickens and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- goats and everything.
R:  W- will I have to pay for this call?
L:  No --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- neither one of us do.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Neither one of us do.  They end up, ah, just moderating in between us and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- basically it's billed to their system and they turn around and supposedly they send us a ten dollar check for as many phone calls as we can do --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, they said there was going to be, within a four to six week period of time we can do twenty to twenty five phone calls.
R:  I don't know if I got everything signed up all r- -- all right for that many phone calls, because I hope so 'cause I could use the money.
L:  Oh, I definitely could too.  You know a site that you might like also is where I found about it is, um, a sample web site and it's called yes it's free dot com.
R:  It's called yes it's free?
L:  Yeah, it goes yes and then there's a dash and then it's dash free dot com and then you can go on there on the very top it'll say, um, sample board, you can go on to there and you can look at thousands upon thousands of free samples --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- that you can just turn around and send out for and there's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a form thing that you can get that'll automatically fill in for you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you're having problems with your hands, all you have to do is basically right click on a space where you'd fill your name and then go down, you know, where you'd normally do copy and paste --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you just would do -- there's and option, that says fill forms --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and you can do that on there.
R:  So it's yes dash it's dash --
L:  Dash.
R:  -- com.
L:  No, free dot com.
R:  Yes it's free.
L:  Yeah, and then there's two dashes and there's a dash in between yes and it's and then it's and free, so it's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- yes dash it's dash free dot com.
R:  Okay, I'll try that.
L:  And then you can go on there and do all that stuff but there's a lot of people that are just really sweet on there and, like, if you have an over abundance of samples, like, you don't use --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they turn around, like, right now we're doing a swap where we just put ten samples together, they're going to give us an address --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we send it out to that person, that we -- we've known on the web site or whatever like that and they turn around and they're sending it to another person that goes in a big circle so we each get a huge package of samples of the ones, you know, we get rid of the ones we're not using.
R:  Do you have to pay for this site?
L:  No, not at all, it's --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  -- absolutely free.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's absolutely free, it's really great.
R:  That sounds wonderful. I, um, do a lot of refunds, ah, with medicine, like Allegra, I take that for an allergy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just got a twenty dollar check today.
L:  Yeah, I was seeing that, because they sent me -- I just got, um, yesterday, the little, ah, kids, ah, dispenser cup and water cup that you can do in the color in pages --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they also sent me, like, the rebate form and stuff like that 'cause they think I have allergies that my doctor had signed me up for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you can get, like, a back pack and a bunch of other stuff and every time you get --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- medicine you get refunds on 'em --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is really good, especially the price of medicine nowadays --
R:  Right.
L:  -- usually, like, a dollar a pill, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is expensive, I feel it's outrageous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But Claritin's actually over the counter now.
R:  I know, and it's about, like, a dollar a pill.
L:  Yep, that's what I was -- they had started me out on that at first and I was like, "That's just atrocious", so I mean, I guess if you get the one that's a prescription and you got insurance, it probably would help you out better because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that way you could just knock it down on your insurance to probably less than that.
R:  Right, if you get like Allegra, you can get it and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- your insurance will pay for some of it and you can get rebates --
L:  Oh, that's -- see that's great though.
R:  -- back on it.
L:  That's really great.  See, I don't have really any insurance because it's my husband, he works as a web hosting and developing company --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so he doesn't have insurance through his company yet and it's a really small business, it's only about four or five people that work inside there, so that's why, you know, but it's not too terribly bad, it's really nice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Well, my husband was laid off and we were paying, like, five hundred and some dollars a month for insurance --
L:  Oh, that's a lot.
R:  -- because we didn't want things to -- we couldn't let things go with my back because we didn't know what to do.
L:  Yeah, see, you've got to do that MRI and everything else like that, you definitely need it.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's not, you know -- that'd be a good reason to keep it, I wouldn't get rid of it.
R:  Well, now he's back to work, so now we don't have to pay that.
L:  What's he do?
R:  Well he used to be a quality control inspector and at the same company and he had been a welder and shipping and receiving and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he worked there for thirty two years --
L:  Oh that's --
R:  -- and we built a new log home.
L:  Oh, that's pretty.
R:  He lost his job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so you have a job and no mortgage and then you have a mortgage and no job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when you're fifty eight years old no one wants to hire you.
L:  Yeah, see that's the bad part about it, and they don't realize that you've got the trade in the background and you can do pretty well in it.
R:  Right, so he's worked at temp services and then he worked at Arrow United, he cut some sheets of steel all day, metal, some kind of metal, aluminum --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they make these, um, things that go on top of buildings, ah, like, they let the air in and out.
L:  Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
R:  Louvers.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  A- and dampers, they make dampers.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  So he's back to work there now and -- and then you know he got laid off and then he worked at a warehouse, now he's back there again, so --
L:  Mm.  Oh.
R:  -- i- it's been very confusing.
L:  Well, at least he's back there though [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know that is a good point right now.  When are you supposed to go for your MRI?
R:  Tuesday.
L:  Yeah, oh, that's good then.  At least they'll be able to help you out.  I've heard of a bunch of people getting, like, cortisone shots, but would that not help you?
R:  Oh, I don't know yet, you know, what's going to happen.
L:  And I've heard of a couple other people getting like a temporary spinal blocks but you can still walk and everything --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- like that, it just deadens the nerves that are hurting you.
R:  And I -- I -- I just don't know, it's kind of like something short circuits and my legs just give out.
L:  Yeah, then you've got something that's pinching your nerves probably in there.
R:  Yeah, that's what I thought.  You know, y- you sound really, really nice, and I only get to talk to you once, right?
L:  Yeah, I think so.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd really like to keep in touch with you.
L:  That would be cool, if you want to you can take my number down.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't have a problem with that, it's nine five four --
R:  Or do you have, um, are you on a computer or anything?
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, give me your email address.
L:  Okay, are you on AOL?
R:  No, I'm on Netscape dot net.
L:  Netscape dot net, okay, mine is capital M as in Mary --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- zero, zero --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- capital N as in Nancy --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and number seven --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- capital C --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- H --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- ILD, so it'll look like moon seven child but the O's are actually zeroes.
R:  Now, is there like, um --
L:  And that's at AOL dot com.
R:  Okay, at --
