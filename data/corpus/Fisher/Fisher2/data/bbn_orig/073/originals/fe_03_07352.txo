L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Dennis.
R:  I'm Francis Lear.
L:  Francis?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a pleasure to meet you.  I guess we're talking about illness.  And changing of the seasons.
R:  Yes, uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and I'm Durham, North Carolina.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, I'm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh yeah.  Okay.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Durham, North Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  D.U.R.H.A.M.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  We're supposed to talk about the season.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you know -- but you know, it's a different season from Pennsylvania to --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- North Carolina, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Indeed.  You don't have a whole lot of change of season down there, compared to what we do, I guess.
R:  Uh-huh.  But because, you know, if ya'll get cold, ya'll stay cold for a while.
L:  Yeah, and you people get cold when it gets seventy degrees. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, we get -- we get cold and sometimes it's minus[?] fifty.
L:  Yeah, you do.  You get snow down there.
R:  But the -- but the nice thing is seventy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the strangers, they say, what -- what can you do?  It's a bit cold, I think that was one of the questions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is the change of season.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, oh, you know, the houses now are so warm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's really hot, it's [several inaudible words] cold here as outside --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- but I think -- I think when you look at the weather report and have thermometers around, then I think you should dress according to that season.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So --
L:  And with -- with the weather channel now you can almost always know what's going to happen, get the kids dressed right and such, which is a good thing.
R:  Mm, that's right you know.  Get ready for it 'cause, ah, in this day and time you know, the doctors all have a field day[?] with these colds and change of weather, but I think it's due to the person himself that didn't take care of himself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and when you go to these doctors often you go there with the flu or something like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They really don't want you there. 
L:  No, well there's not much you can do for the flu, so, they usually just tell you to go home and take aspirin.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well I -- I had a doctor's appointment once.  I went there after I got the flu, and when I got there he said, "Why'd you come here?"  I said, "Well, I already had this appointment", you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He said, "Well you should be home in bed and -- and drinking chicken soup."
L:  Yeah.  That --
R:  I don't -- I don't know why [inaudible]
L:  [LAUGH] They been giving that prescription for hundreds of years, I guess.  It hasn't changed that much.
R:  They sure have, but you know what, an old person told me there's something in the chicken that really helps you.
L:  Yeah, I heard that.  I heard that.
R:  Well I -- I never -- I never found out what that was though.
L:  Well, I guess probably the protein, for one thing, helps you, you know, keeps you --
R:  Well yeah, that's true.  That goes for -- I understand protein to get well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, one thing about the chicken is it's not full of cholesterol like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, like -- like pork is.
L:  There you go.
R:  And red meat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I just -- I think the old folk, they're right all the time.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They just come up here and say eat protein, protein, and I went to the hospital and I got burned in December and went to hospital and they said my proteins were low.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  I said, I say, "Have you ever heard of a person with low cholesterol got protein too high?"  They say, "You need to eat meat.  Eat meat every three meals."
L:  Yeah, really?  That's unusual, they're telling everybody not to most of the time.
R:  That's right and I could -- I couldn't take it.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  So I -- I asked for some protein powder.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they had that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because all meat to me is hard on my digestive system.
L:  Right.
R:  -- all them meat, but um, I tried to stick to it and I got [inaudible] and came out.  But anyway, now we have now, we are having -- we have thunder storms.
L:  Yeah.  We- -- we're having just ah, low pressure -- we're having rain and humidity is really hitting us hard here now --
R:  Yeah. But I understand last year when the ah -- when the ah, season was dry down here last year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they was said it was dry all over.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did ya'll have it dry?
L:  Oh we had a drought everywhere, on the east coast they had a drought, ah, --
R:  Yeah?
L:  yeah, it was really bad.  I know the New York State was like, six inches, eight inches below their normal, but I think it's been, ah, fixed this year, they've had a lot of rain this year, I know.
R:  Oh yeah, a lot of bodies bubbled up down here.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's right. [LAUGH] 
R:  I think oh lord, when it rains everything comes up, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I -- and I -- and down here where we are, we had one, two, th- -- three bodies.
L:  You're kidding!
R:  And Florida they had, oh, like you know, it was a man with a baby --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] 
L:  Oh my god.
R:  There's two up here -- there's two up here in North Carolina came up.  One was [inaudible]
L:  I know it happens in New Orleans because it's so low there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- whenever --
R:  Low?
L:  -- yeah.  But I never heard of that in -- in North Carolina.  That's pretty amazing.
R:  It is.  People have thought they got rid of their folks and [several inaudible words] so when it rains the other week[?] it came up on a man's farm.
L:  Oh, brother.
R:  As I was saying, I said, hm, I said, they thought they had all their stuff covered already and it come bubbling up.
L:  Oh, brother.  Yeah, that's sad.
R:  It -- it sure is.  But you know what, likely just stay down there it wouldn't hurt too bad, but when it all come up everybody was [several inaudible words] on account of that weather.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now their [several inaudible words]
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  a-- a [inaudible] flood rather, about two days ago it flooded in, ah, the D block area.
L:  Are you near -- are you near the mountains?  Are you near the mountains, or the coast?
R:  No, I'm near the -- I'm near the coast, Wimbledon.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  I'm near there.  
L:  So you have hurricanes to worry about.
R:  Yeah, mhm, that's right.  And tornados too.
L:  Yeah, I lived in Maine for four years and ah, we had hurricanes when I was up there.  It was pretty scary.
R:  Yeah.  Some -- some places don't have them too often, I think it's the low valley, something like the mountains --
L:  Right.
R:  and make 'em -- and make 'em, ah --
L:  Well I remember I was up --
R:  -- not as strong.
L:  I was up there when Hurricane Bob came up the east coast and the eye of the hurricane passed right over where I was.  That was pretty exciting.
R:  Mhm.  So getting back to -- to the doctor's, I think they want to talk on that too, doctors and medicines and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the flu.
L:  Mhm.  You've got a flu shot?
R:  Well, every time I got one, I got sick so I didn't get it.
L:  Yeah?  Yeah.
R:  But I di -- I did get a pneumonia shot, but that sort of hits you, but it wasn't as bad the flu, 'cause I took a flu shot um, two years straight, I believe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I had it so bad I had to go get an antibiotic.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Uh-huh.  My mother always told me that, "You know when you take medicines you always got to go back to the doctors to see about the medicine you took."
L:  That's right, well it's the active virus you know.  They give it to you --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- some people do get it from the -- from the preventative.
R:  And then I figure that maybe I'm just weak to start with, 'cause they said don't have a cold [several inaudible words] when you go.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Don't you ever come down with it, so --
L:  That's right.
R:  So I figure I must be weaker than I thought I was.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I had a aunt that, she was mighty sick and she asked the doctor should she take a flu -- flu shot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um, he said, no, he said, "If you get the flu I'd rather just treat you for the flu."
L:  Is that right?
R:  Wh -- which made sense because when I took mine, I still had to be treated.
L:  Yeah, well they figured that ah, the risk with her was such that she was better off without it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's right, well see, the doctors don't tell you that.  They always say get a flu shot, and then when you get your medicare statement, you failed on that.  Don't forget your flu shot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Don't forget your flu shot, they just -- they just making people sick and making money coming back in --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- trying to get well.
L:  Right.
R:  And no medicare pay for all of this so they start it up, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, get medicare pay for it, but I -- there's just so much medicine and stuff out there now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you really you don't know what to take, you just -- you're better off going to the herb store and get you some herb tea and drink that.
L:  Maybe there's something to be said for that.  Zinc oxide is supposed to be good too.  Those p- -- those lozenges now, that help with the flu and a cold --
R:  What's the name of it?
L:  -- it's zinc oxide --
R:  Oh yeah, zinc oxide.
L:  -- lozenges, and soon as you start getting symptoms you suck on those things and it's supposed to cut back the intensity of the flu and the cold for you.
R:  Mhm.  And um, another person was saying about the [inaudible] they drink, you ever had charcoal water?
L:  No.
R:  Well they said charcoal water is good.
L:  When you get the flu, or after -- er, before you get it?
R:  Anything.  It's good for anything.
L:  Oh.
R:  Sort of like a [inaudible] But they said it used to be over the counter but people was calling for it so much, they put it over there by the pres- -- prescription.
L:  Is that right?
R:  And handed it out like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's --
L:  What's it called, again?
R:  Charcoal.
L:  It's just got charcoal in it?
R:  I -- that's what I don't know, it's called charcoal water.
L:  Charcoal water, no never heard of that.
R:  But I do -- but I do know, ah, my daughter has a filter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a charcoal filter.
L:  Well, I'll be.
R:  So I guess it does filter or do something, I don't know what it does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um, people have to be very careful about cold and climate because I know even in the um, [inaudible] you see people leaving here with their
