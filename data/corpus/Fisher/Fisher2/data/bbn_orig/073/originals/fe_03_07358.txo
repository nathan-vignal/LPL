L:  I'm Cindy.
R:  I'm Dante.  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's okay, this is strange.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, all right, so, illness.
R:  Right.  Have you done this before?
L:  Why don't you go?  What's that?
R:  You ever done this before?
L:  No, I have not, and I'm doing it for my best friend, so -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, okay, all it is is basically just like they said, you know, the topic was, you know, what do you do to keep yourself from getting ill.
L:  Okay.  I work out all the time and I walk my dogs. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, yeah, [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And I eat soup.
R:  Yeah, okay.  I try -- I try to eat as much of vegetables and fruits as I could.
L:  Oh that's good.  I used to do that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, the better intake, the better it is, you know for your system to -- to help in as far as your immunities, um, one thing I do though, is I try not to take medicines hardly ever, unless I'm already completely sick, and the reason why, they just kind of let my body just build up with it, because I read somewhere a long time ago that, huh, the more that you let your body just ah, build up some immunities, um, the stronger it is for when other attacks come, not always relying on medicines.
L:  I have a two sided thing.  I do that somewhat, but then if I get like, bronchitis in the early stages --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I take medication, like, right away.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  But that's the only time I do that.
R:  No, I understand that, I mean, well just like I take Echinacea, like, if I even feel the sniffles coming on.
L:  Oh, there you go.
R:  You know, but I mean, for the most part, you know, I try to stay away from everything, um --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- then on top of that, just, you know, common sense.  Like, if it's cold, you know, I wear hats.  I mean a lot of females, I don't know about you, I mean, they have long hair that covers their ears and their neck so they stay warm everywhere.  Guys have cold necks and cold ears, so, you know, you try to cover up by -- since that area's exposed, you warm up the top part.  You know.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  Do you live somewhere cold?
R:  No, I live in California, Southern California.
L:  Okay, me -- me too.
R:  Whereabouts?
L:  I'm in um, Santa Rosa area --
R:  Santa Rosa.
L:  -- in the [inaudible] country.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I'm down here --
L:  So we get pretty cold here too.
R:  Yeah I bet.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Just outside of LA.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm from there actually.
R:  Oh, then well, Bolden Park.  Do you know where that is?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You do?
L:  Yes I do.
R:  Okay, cool.
L:  Yeah, I do, but see, you have smog down there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that's like, a health problem, because we actually lived in Riverside for a little while --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the smog actually kept me in the hospital, like, in and out of emergency rooms because of my asthma --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I don't have to deal with that now.  So part of it is just living somewhere where it's cleaner, I mean, in regards to illness.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I literally -- I couldn't even work in Riverside because it made me so sick --
R:  Well, see --
L:  -- I know, it's awful.
R:  -- yeah.  I was going to say, I actually spent um, three years in Arizona and you know, because it's so dry out there nothing really li- -- I mean, a lot of people go there for -- for health reasons, you know, arthritis and ah, allergies and what not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and for me, I would get sick every year.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, but out here, I don't know, maybe just 'cause, you know, I'm so used to it, I get sick maybe once every three years or so.  I'm talking about really sick, like, a really bad fever, I mean, 'cause I'll get the sniffles, I'll get little colds and um, just -- just for, you know, dumb information, you know that you never get the same cold twice?
L:  I didn't know that.  But you know, it's funny that you say that about going out of state --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because when I go back home, I'm actually from San Diego, I went to college, um, in Long Beach --
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  --but in San Diego I don't get sick, ever.
R:  Right.
L:  As a matter of fact, I'm -- when they've done the allergy testing on me, I'm actually allergic to also to desert pollen and leaves --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but some -- for some reason, when I'm at home, I think that -- that I built up so much immunity --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, just growing up there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I think I fight things off, but where I'm living now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I do get sick periodically.
R:  Right.
L:  Not -- not nearly as often as Riverside, so I think the environment matters --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, you know, I don't know, I think the older we get the smarter we are, too. [LAUGH] I sleep better, and --
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.
L:  -- I do all those things, whereas when I was a kid I'd stay up all night. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  No -- no, I definitely know how that goes.
L:  Hee hee.
R:  You know, I -- I'm still like that, I mean, I'm just one of those guys, that after ten o'clock I could actually just wake up and stay up for another two, three hours.
L:  Really?
R:  I really have to force myself to go to sleep.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, but you know, now that I'm -- I'm actually at a new job where I actually have to ah, get up pretty early and sometimes drive pretty far, so if -- now I'm being able to say, yeah, I need to fall asleep more.
L:  Oh, totally.
R:  And it's easier to -- easier to handle with now, but --
L:  Yeah, well I work with teenagers, too.  I work in a high school so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, I mean, they pass things around, so I have to get my sleep because if I don't, keeping up with teenagers the next day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then with all the colds and everything flying around there --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- it's crazy.
R:  I bet.
L:  [LAUGH] Crazy.  Okay, I don't remember any of the other topics.  They said like, five things, do you?
R:  They -- I've never heard one so long before in my life.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, but it said, yeah, I mean, this is like, the fifth or sixth one I've done.
L:  Okay.
R:  And ah, I can't remember, some -- it was like, some cliche or some saying that they normally say.
L:  Seven day cold something, something.
R:  Yeah, no clue.  Care less.
L:  I don't have any idea about that one either.
R:  That's -- you know, I'll leave a note at the end saying, you know, make your topics shorter.
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But you know, like, I can freak out on some things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, my husband was on me about um, what is it? [LAUGH] I was freaking out about the SARS thing -- no, not the SARS thing, the -- the mad cow --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  I was about ready to cut meat out of my diet --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he told me that that was just -- I mean, he gets grumpy about media, so he told me to mellow out. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  He said it probably would never get here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you eat meat?
R:  Oh yeah.  But I'm more of a poultry person, I mean, I -- like, I've grown meat that we use.  We use turkey meat.
L:  Do you?
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  We just -- we like that, it just -- you know, you make with your um, your spaghetti --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, your hamburger helper or, you know, anything quick and easy, your -- your patties for your burgers, we make turkey burgers.  So 
L:  That's smart, not mean.
R:  I mean, there are times [LAUGH] th- -- there are times where we actually, you know, buy the meat and stuff, you know, just 'cause you can't get away with it, so whenever you just want it, but um, yeah, we -- we eat a lot of chicken, a lot of turkey, and then we have pork, and --
L:  That's really smart.  I actually have pets that are on a raw diet --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which means that they actually eat raw meat [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  --and because of it, I think we probably eat more beef. [LAUGH] 'Cause we buy it at the same time.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Which is very cool.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm not going to eat the rest -- ah, but at the same time that they're eating it [LAUGH] I guess we're just all kind of [inaudible] together.
R:  Right.
L:  But the animals live longer --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- if they eat red meat.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  So my dog hasn't had to get her teeth cleaned in probably about three years.
R:  Wow.
L:  And he's six years old and you usually have to get 'em cleaned like, every couple of years.
R:  That's right.
L:  So, and they actually said that the dogs live longer --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so I guess, you know, we've covered the spectrum here.  How long to they want us to talk about illness.
R:  They let us know.
L:  Eating, sleeping [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.
L:  No -- no medications except for Echinacea, right, I'm on that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what else?  Oh yeah, I have a, um, I work with a coworker --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she cracks me up.  She literally will not go shopping --
R:  Right.
L:  -- without ah, latex gloves.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  I know, it cracks me up actually.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  It does -- I know, I tell her that, and actually we torment her because every time anybody has any kind of germs --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we all go hang out in her office --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so we all start coughing and she's starts yelling "Get out!  Out!  Out!"  But you know, people who go so far as to do that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's bad.
R:  [COUGH] How -- let me see -- um --
L:  Yeah, you pick your brain now.
R:  No, no, no, I'm just thinking, because what you said about that, I mean o- -- one thing I do, I mean, I -- played football for ten years --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and every coach that I ever -- that I ever talked to said that when, hah, whenever you have to worry about something, it'll usually happen to you.
L:  Oh, totally.
R:  And every -- every -- and every person I've known that had a worry about injury got severely injured.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they say if you just go crazy, you know, you never get hurt, and I -- I -- I'm one of those people that, you know, you drop food on the floor, I believe in the two second rule, you know, I mean --
L:  I was just saying, you and the two second rule, that's what my husband says.
R:  Well yeah, that's what I'm saying, I mean, to me, I mean, it -- it's, you know, I try not to worry about a lot of things, because a lot of it is psychological, I think.
L:  Yeah, no, the diet -- the -- the -- the um, dirt thing, my grandfather always said a little dirt actually does you good, 'cause it builds up more immunity.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Well, I mean, think about all the stuff that's in it, so 
R:  Yeah, I run with that theory.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, like breastfeeding and all that stuff too, if you end up breastfeeding your kids they're supposed to build up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more immunity and then that lasts for a long time, so you never know.  I mean things come from all sorts of funky places.
R:  I have one twenty --
L:  Woof, woof -- sorry, I have a lot of dogs.
R:  I thought that was you! [LAUGH] 
L:  That was me, you're right.  The way I fight of diseases is I bark at them. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] No, I just thought you went like, agh, agh, agh.  You know, just like, no, but what I was going to say I have a twenty month old, he'll be twenty months old on the nineteenth --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and um, he was breastfed all the way up to seventeen months.
L:  And I bet it made a big difference.
R:  Well, I mean, so far, I mean, he's only been sick like maybe, well once, really bad when he was actually kind of throwing up and all that stuff, um, and then the other times he just gets the sniffles in like, a couple of days and I know of our friend's kids that don't like, breast feed, or whatnot, that they're, you know, their kids stay sick for four, five, six, seven days.
L:  Right on.  Well you know the other thing that's really nasty when they become teenagers?
R:  What?
L:  Hygiene.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because in working with the teenagers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I gotta tell you, it's really nasty.  The ones that don't wash their hair very well --
R:  Right.
L:  -- oh god, we've had kids come to school with like, ringworm.
R:  Oh.
L:  And things like that, really, just from not washing their hair and not [inaudible] like, you know, that kind of thing.
R:  Oh.
L:  So don't forget to like, do like, some kind of little song and dance with your kid when they're old enough to learn how to scrub. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, that's fine, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, I mean [LAUGH] I wa- -- I was steered in the correct direction, so I'm going to try and steer my kids in the correct direction too.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, I didn't -- I would never even think about it, except for when you work in a high school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's totally obvious.
R:  Yeah, but wait a minute, I mean, when you were in high school, I mean, you sound like you were a cool chick in high school, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- would -- would that be true?
L:  Yeah, I was actually really bad.  I was one of the -- my -- you know I -- I actually love the kids that are like I used to be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but the rest of the teachers don't. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah, okay, now see, that's what I'm saying, I mean, like, I mean, I'm not tooting my own horn, but I was like, captain of the football team, I was in
