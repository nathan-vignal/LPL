R:  Hello?

R:  All right.  How are you?
L:  Uh, I'm fine.
R:  My name is Gary.
L:  Yeah.  My name is, uh [inaudible].
R:  Okay.  I guess we're supposed to talk about bad habits.
L:  Yeah.  Um, do you have any bad habits?
R:  Well, I smoke, but I don't drink anymore.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh ...
L:  So, uh, how much do you smoke?
R:  Uh, a pack and a half a day.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  That's -- that's a lot.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Uh ...
R:  Unless I'm stressed out and then I'll smoke two packs a day, you know?  But ...
L:  So, how long have you smoked?
R:  Uh, thirty two years.
L:  Oh, thirty two years?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm forty three.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm thirty three years old.
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah.  But for --
R:  But I ...
L:  -- for -- for several years I smoked a little, but now I -- I quited smoking.
R:  Yeah.  Well, what do you think is worst?  I think the two worst are smoking and drinking 'cause drinking you can drunk driving, you could kill people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and most -- most people that are in jail are in jail because they were -- did something while they were under the influence.  You know what I mean?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like robbing or doing -- you know, fighting and destroying stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know.  Probably smoking kills more people.
L:  Oh, you mean, smoke can kill more people?
R:  I don't know.  What do you --
L:  Yeah.  I think ...
R:  -- what do you think?
L:  I think alcohol may kill more people than smoking.
R:  Alcohol related, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  You know, if you get drunk you may drive a car and, uh, hit into another car, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But if you just smoke maybe, uh, you can get, uh, lung cancer.  But you -- you may not kill other people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You might not get cancer either.  I know -- well, I know people that got cancer that don't even smoke.  But my grandfather was a heavy smoker, he smoked 'til he -- he lived to be eighty seven years old and, uh ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, maybe [LAUGH] ...  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, that depends on the person I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it is bad for ya.  I notice it even when I breathe, you know, it does clog me up.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- alcohol, yeah, I think more people are in jail because they were either on drugs or alcohol for -- whenever they did their crime, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I think, yeah, alcohol is very -- is very [MN] -- a very [inaudible] and, you know, you may -- you may do something very bad, uh, under the influence of alcohol.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you drink?
L:  Uh, I think -- I don't drink because, you know, um, the American -- many people just drink beer and -- but I -- I don't like beer.
R:  Ah.
L:  You -- you can have -- sometimes we drink wine, you know, during holiday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We may drink some wine and sometimes when your friends and -- and you get together you may [LIPSMACK] have some -- some alcohol but, uh -- but not -- not too often, not too much.
R:  Nah.
L:  Nah.
R:  Oh, it's like accepted in society.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know?  If we watch football ya drink beer.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You watch the fights you drink beer.  You go out dancing you get drunk.  Every weekend's a party, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  Yes.  And sometimes I think the people around you may -- may affect you, you know?  If you are around, uh, a group of people they never smoke or they never drink --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the beer.  Even -- even you'll drink or even you'll smoke or you may quit, yeah.
R:  Yeah, 'cause even if I'm around people that don't smoke I won't smoke by 'em, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that don't really bother me, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I don't know.  It's -- that's more of a habit too --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, when you don't smoke you're always looking to put something in your mouth or you're done eating and you feel like smoking like a cigarette or -- you know, especially if ya drink you wanna smoke more.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think smoke and the drink are -- are friends, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You -- you -- yeah, if you drink you may, yeah, have -- have a smoke.  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  They -- they have -- they were, uh, saying about other topics was overeating and not exercising too and that's -- you know, that's not good either.  But I don't ...
L:  What -- what exercises ...?
R:  Exercising.  People that don't exercise are at a high risk, which they are, but I think drinking and smoking is the two worst --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- outta the list they gave us.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They said about people that don't exercise or people that are overweight.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think, uh, people are gaining weight, uh, are getting fat [LIPSMACK] I think most probably because of the food they eat, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  Do you -- do you exercise regularly?
R:  Not regularly, but I work a lot and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it keeps me in shape.  Sometimes I exercise.  I'll ride a bike --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to work sometimes.  I'll tell ya I weigh -- I weigh five pounds less than when I was in high school [LAUGH], you know?

L:  Yeah.  I'm not -- I'm not fat.  I am thin.
R:  Nah, man, I'm like -- people say I'm small, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]

L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sometimes, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'm always active and my metabolism -- I've always gotta do something, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some people they just lay around and they eat and then they can't move and then they can't exercise 'cause they're too big and they don't wanna 'cause they're outta breath.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  Yes.  I think, uh -- yeah, I -- just some people they move very slowly because they are -- they are too fat.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, some people are big -- big boned or whatever, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some people are just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- overweight.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- yeah.
R:  In fact I seen on T.V. the other night that, uh, overweight people have more chance of getting cancer --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and the overweight kids -- keep your kids in shape they'll have less of a chance when they get older.
