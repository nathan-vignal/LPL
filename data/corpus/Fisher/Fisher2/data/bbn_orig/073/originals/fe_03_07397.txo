L:  Hello, this is Kathy[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Kristy[?].
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you live in Alaska?
R:  No, I don't, actually.
L:  Okay.  I'm sorry, you sounded like my friend Kristy who lives in Alaska.  I was thinking --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Oh, my gosh.  What a coincidence". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, no, I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Canada, so.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay, sorry about that.
R:  [several inaudible words] no problem. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But um -- yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- out of all those habits, I would have to say I think that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gossiping would be the worst --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because the only one you really hurt is [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is other people.  All the other ones, you only really hurt -- is yourself.
R:  Exactly.  I completely agree.
L:  Um, unless you're smoking I guess and then the second hand smoke would ah ...
R:  Yeah, it depends where you smoke, I guess.
L:  Right.
R:  As long as -- al- -- most people these days --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  I think, are -- are starting to smoke away from their kids and their families, so --
L:  Yeah, I remember when I was a kid they -- um, my parents smoked in the car with us and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- everywhere else and didn't really have much, you know?
R:  Exactly.  But I -- I don't think they knew really then how bad the second hand smoke was although --
L:  Right, [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- you'd think -- the connection but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  You'd think they'd make the connection, you know, if it's bad for me it must be bad for the kids but ...
L:  Right.  But I guess the figure it dissipated as, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- if you weren't [NOISE] inhaling it like they were or --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- whatever.  Because I used to smoke also --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I didn't really think about smoking around my [NOISE] niece and nephew, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I couldn't imagine smoking in front of my kids now, because I --
R:  Yeah, that's the thing, once you quit you and you realise and as time passes.  Because I used to smoke too and my parents smoked around me and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know, when you're smoking, you kind of think, "Oh, you know --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's fine and that's why I quit actually, because I had my daughter and I didn't --
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R: -- you know, I didn't really want to smoke inside. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, it wasn't worth it to, ah -- to risk her -- her health, for me --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- to do something that's killing me anyway, so.
L:  [LAUGH] That's right. [NOISE].
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, what's really got me to stop was my mother, she has cancer, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and she smoked, so.
R:  That'll do it.
L:  That kind of did it for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my mom died of, ah, liver failure from alcoholism --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that's why I don't drink, so.
L:  Oh, man.  Mm.
R:  So, same idea.  Yeah.  So, no drinking, no smoking.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Although, overeating maybe. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know, I'm -- I'm with that one too.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  I like to eat but I figure, you know, [NOISE] it's either overeating or [NOISE] it's, you know?
R:  Exactly.  Fill it with something and --
L:  Drinking or smoking. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, better than those.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it's much better than those. [LAUGH]
L:  At least one -- [NOISE] hold -- hold on.
R:  Yeah, no problem. [LAUGH]
L:  You need to be quiet. [LAUGH] Sorry about that, it's --
R:  No problem. [LAUGH]
L:  -- bath time in my household. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  My daughter's trying -- I'm hiding in the bathroom --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she's trying to break in a get me.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I completely understand. [LAUGH]
L:  Doesn't it seem like the only time they bother you is when you're on the phone? [LAUGH]
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, without fail, it's the same with my husband, though. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly, I --
R:  It seems like, you know, you get on the phone and then they're like, "Oh, well I have all this stuff to talk to you about all of a sudden".
L:  Yes.  Right.  [NOISE] And as soon as you hang up there's silence --
R:  Exactly, they disappear.
L:  -- they have nothing to say.
R:  You don't see them again until the phone rings. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well.
L:  I guess we're getting a little bit off topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  So -- actually it's funny because the last call I had, ah, for this, I was talking a little bit about friends and, ah, we were saying how --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, both of us didn't have a huge --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- number of friends because we found the gossiping --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was -- was -- a huge number of female friends anyway --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because we found that the gossiping could be so bad.  Um, and she lives in a small town --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so in -- in a small town you find the gossip is also a little more predominant. [LAUGH] So, I think it's just funny that they, ah, bring this up now, discussing the gossiping.
L:  Right.  It's bad at my work too --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you just don't know who to trust or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and most of us -- the girls who do it, I hate to say it.
R:  Yeah.  Oh and it's true.  I think it's the nature, just of -- of men and women, our personalities, just our makeup's.  Men, they don't care so much to talk about that stuff --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  It j- just didn't interest them, whereas women for some reason, we're just wired differently and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- gossipers, you know, there are men who like to gossip but I -- I would say that the majority is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the majority of people who are watching Inside Edition and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Entertainment Tonight and getting The Enquirer are women, so.
L:  Right.
R:  That's fine.  I mean, we're all -- we're all different and then there's those of us who just can't be bothered with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's [SIGH] -- that's fine too because --
L:  It's easy to fall into it.
R:  Oh, it is, especially at work.  Because with friends -- you know, if your friends are talking about it, you can kind of say, "Oh, shut up" because they're your friends, but at work you can't say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to a coworker or your boss --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Oh, shut up" you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Right. [NOISE]
R:  It doesn't work.  So, if -- if your boss is saying something to you that, you know, that -- the only thing you can really do is stand there and go, "Oh, really.  Oh, okay" -- ah, or a coworker and then just, you know, pretty much ignore it, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- it's tough at work, very tough.
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  So, that's why I'm glad I don't have to work. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well I work part time, so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I couldn't not work. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.  You know?
R:  I grew -- I can't stand it, I worked at home, like I -- I own my own company --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --
L:  Oh, well good for you.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I did that because ah, I had nothing else to do while I was sitting [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- around [LAUGH] with my daughter.
L:  Can I be nosey and ask what you do?
R:  Um, it's computer consulting, just --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- of -- the -- I run the +gamut, whatever I can do I do.  So, everything from technical support all the way to web design and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, software design and all kinds of stuff, so.
L:  Do you place ads or something locally or ...?
R:  No, it's -- it's all networking.  [SIGH] Um, because I don't have so much time to dedicate to it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I haven't really, you know, put myself out there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because my daughter's only in school a half day.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um -- so, right now it's just, ah, through people I worked for before.  Organizations I've contacted and then from there it's just grown.
L:  Cool. [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah that's -- it's --
L:  That's cool.  Because what -- I'm a computer specialist --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- where I work, so.
R:  Oh, there you go.
L:  So, that's good.
R:  It's a -- it's a good thing to do if you just want to stay home, because with computers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can find -- even the simplest stuff, even people just needing help with their computers, they'll pay you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they have no idea --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what [LAUGH] they're doing.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So, it's -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something that even part time -- like you said you work part time, you could always do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it -- it's definitely something.
L:  It seems like nowadays though that, some- somebody [NOISE] always knows somebody that knows somebody that knows something about computers [NOISE] --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and they get that person to work on it and then it screws up even more.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  This is where I come in, after those --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people have screwed it up. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  That's when they call me and say, "Oh, no" and I say, "Well, now it's going to take twice as long" --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and they learn from that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they say, "Oh, well I'm not going to pay him five dollars an hour or whatever to fix it.  I'm going to pay you" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah -- ah, that's basically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what I market --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- myself as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm the one who repairs it after somebody screws --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it up.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it works. [LAUGH]
L:  Your friend who fixes it for free, isn't free --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I'm going to charge you more than he -- you know, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- than I would have in the beginning. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I could of -- I could have talked to -- you through it over the phone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I actually have to come to your house and that's trouble.
L:  Right.
R:  And there's a lot of that, because a lot of people say, "Oh, I've got my own computer, I know what I'm doing" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, sixteen year old neighbor or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, a little computer geek that plays on there --
R:  Yeah, exac- --
L:  -- five hours a day and thinks he knows it all.
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just because you know how to use AOL Messenger and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Internet Explorer doesn't mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know anything about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- installing or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whatever, because so many of them -- that's where a lot of problems lie is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people installing Outlook and stuff like that, that's really important to them, for their business email --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and totally screwing it up and then they call me, "Oh, I can't find my email" and oh, I love it, lots of work for me.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  And none of the, ah, internet providers here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- will service it.  They will only service one program, which is Outlook Explorer.  So, anything else they come to me, so.
L:  You mean, Internet Explorer?
R:  No, ah, for email --
L:  Oh, Outlook.
R:  -- Outlook Ex- -- Outlook Express, I mean.
L:  Okay.  So, they won't even service like Netscape Mail and --
R:  Nope, or Eudora or even plain Outlook --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- they won't touch it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and if you have a Mac --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's no way -- no way they'll come near you, so.
L:  We- -- well, I don't know anything about those, so.
R:  No, neither do I. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's beyond me but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, it's incredible how little they support and yet they're our only option here, the -- the one that, ah, most people are with.  You have one DFL[?] and one cable and that's it.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  So, you're stuck with it.  You don't have a choice but to go to them, so they come to me when they have problems.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I get a lot of phone calls at two in the morning, you know --
L:  Oh, that's gotta suck.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- "It's not working".  Yeah, so that's all right.  I -- they -- I charge more late at night.  If you don't call within, you know, twelve to five, that's it you're in trouble.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like having your own little contracts and stuff or whatever --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, that's good.
R:  Exactly, so.
L:  [MN] It works out well.
R:  Yes, it does.  It's very nice.  So, there you go.  I guess there's not really much to talk about with gossip. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know, that's -- yeah, the worst -- because like I said, the other ones you only hurt yourself.  I guess in the long --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- run, maybe your family, but ...
R:  But that's not -- it's not as intentionally hurtful, I think.
L:  Right.
R:  Whereas gossip -- it's -- when you think of gossip, you think it's bad.  When you think of overeating, you think, "Well, it's r- --"
L:  I'll just get fat. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you can remedy it".  Yeah, you get fat and, you know, you can always get thin again if you really get determined, but ah --"
L:  It's harder to --
R:  -- with gossip you can't fix it.
L:  That's right.
R:  Once you've hurt someone, you've hurt someone and that's that. [MN] [NOISE]
L:  What else was there?  Drinking and smoking and what was the other one --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- not working out ...?
R:  And caffeine.
L:  Oh, [SIGH] that's --
R:  Too much caffeine. [LAUGH]
L:  -- such a low --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- thing on the totem pole.
R:  I'd rather be, you know, excessively hyped up from caffeine [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- than any of the others, I think.
L:  Yeah, same.
R:  And not exercising, ah some people are lazy.  I'm lazy, I don't exercise, so that's fine by me.
L:  Yeah, I'm lazy too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I could find a sport that I like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then I would play, as long as I have a comfort zone of who I'm playing with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't want to play with a bunch of strangers. [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  That's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, my problem is, I can't find anyone to play with me because my daughter's too young and my husband gets home from work, he just wants, you know, to sit around and watch TV --
L:  To veg, yeah.
R:  -- he's too tired, so.  And nobody else wants [LAUGH] to play with me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they don't -- because the only sport I really play is tennis and they say, "Well, you always beat me" and so [SIGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH]
R:  "-- they don't want to play.  Like the silliest thing, "Well, don't you want to play
