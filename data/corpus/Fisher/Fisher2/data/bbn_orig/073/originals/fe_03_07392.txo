R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE] My name's Liz.
L:  My name's Mandy.
R:  Hey.
L:  What was your name again?
R:  Liz.
L:  Liz?
R:  Elizabeth.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I couldn't hardly hear you.  I don't know what was wrong. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I probably don't get very good reception.  I'm at the New Jersey Shore.
L:  [LAUGH] Ooh.  Oh.  Ah. [NOISE]
R:  So which do you think is the worse habit?  What did they say?  Smoking --
L:  The worst habit.
R:  Smoking, drinking alcohol, drinking caffeine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gossiping or something else --
L:  I do them all. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] You do them all?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  All I d- -- all I do is drink and gossip I think, so 
L:  Drink and gossip?  
R:  Yep.  
L:  Well, I, ah  hold on a second.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [PAUSE] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay.
L:  That was my husband.  Um, let's see  gossip -- yeah, I -- I gossip.  Not a lot, not as much as I used to.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I'm --
R:  Which do you think is worse since you do --
L:  Which do I think is worse.
R:  -- them all?  I don't wanna say. [LAUGH]
L:  Probably worse is probably smoking.
R:  Yeah.  I'd say that too.  My dad does that and he admits it's his worse vice, so 
L:  It's -- it's probably -- I quit -- I just had a baby I quit for nine months and I started back up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's how bad it is.
R:  Yeah.  That's really hard --
L:  But at least I gave it up for that long.
R:  Really hard to kick, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Probably -- though smoking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and not exercising are probably a tie.
R:  Oh, is that one of them?
L:  Yeah.  Not exercising.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Y- yeah, I guess and --
L:  And over eating.
R:  -- worst healthwise.  Yeah.
L:  Healthwise.  What do you think?
R:  I'd say smoking is at the top of the list followed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- by not exercising.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean it's -- it's a lot more gradual but it still can ruin your health.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  But then again I had a grandpa that died at seventy five.  He was a smoker all of his life, prisoner of war and everything else and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he -- he lived to be seventy five.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He smoked a pack a day.  See it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just depends on the person more so than anything, I think.
R:  And, they say it's mostly genetics.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How long you live.  But 
L:  Yep.
R:  I guess the quality of life is determined by what you do when you're alive.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um  [MN] 
R:  I don't think -- I don't think dri- -- I mean, unless you're an alcoholic I don't think drinking is a huge problem. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it could be.
R:  Maybe I'm wrong.
L:  It could be.  I have a -- my, ah, my father is an alcoholic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- it's a big problem.  It -- it gets you down in debt, makes you not wanna work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You have the shakes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's genetic.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if -- I have to watch drinking, you know, because I have -- if I have the gene then I could become --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- an alcoholic.  So it could be bad too because it can ruin your life.
R:  Right.  Right.  But I guess the difference between drinking and smoking is, there really isn't any decent reasonable limits.  
L:  Right.
R:  It's just -- okay, you know what I mean?  Like, you would just smoke a little bit and they could kill you so -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Very true. 
R:  But drinking a little probably will never kill you.
L:  That's true too.
R:  Unless you combine it with some medication or something.
L:  Right.  Right.  You said combine it with a antidepressant and it could kill ya.
R:  Right.
L:  Or a -- a pain pill or something.  So 
R:  Gossiping is a fairly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- random one they put in there.
L:  Yeah, it is random.  It gets -- [SIGH] I guess, the only way it could hurt you is if you gossip about someone they could mad at you and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- hurt you some way.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I guess they don't mean physically but 
L:  Yeah.  But gossiping isn't -- it hurts people's feelings.
R:  Right.
L:  It hurts their emotions more than physically --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hurting them.
R:  Right.
L:  So.  Yeah, I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't do much gossiping.  I live in a small rural area and everyone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gossips and I try not to.
R:  Where're you from?
L:  Um, it's a small town in Indiana. 
R:  Okay.
L:  It's called Orleans. 
R:  Okay.
L:  You've probably never heard of it.
R:  No, but I've only been to Indiana once so 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Where'd you go in Indiana?
R:  I drove through it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm embarrassed to say I drove through it on my way west. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Wh- -- and where do you live?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I live in New Jersey.
L:  New Jersey.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I go to school in Washington DC.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  College?
R:  Yep.
L:  I went -- I went to IU.
R:  Oh, yeah? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  Went to IU.  Graduated from there. [SIGH] Um, what else can we ?  They didn't -- that's -- that's kind of a broad topic.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  They didn't -- the la- -- the last one I did they gave us specific questions.
R:  Yeah.  The last one I think I did was about, um, perjury in a court room.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It was very specific.  Yes.
L:  I bet that was interesting.
R:  yeah, [MN] --
L:  The last one I did was about  I can't even remember.  One of them was about pets.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I don't have any pets.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] I would kill to know what they're studying.  I mean, I know you're not supposed to know 'cause you would --
L:  Yeah, I know --
R:  -- react differently but --
L:  Who knows.
R:  -- I'm just dying to know what they're actually doing.
L:  Probably something about our language or how we -- how we interact, um, not knowing someone.
R:  I gues- -- yes, speech pattern.  I mean, I know -- the reason I started doing this study is I know someone who works for them and so she couldn't do it because she works for them, so she knows what's going on but she -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could tell me that I could do it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to make money so it was an easy way to make money.
L:  Huh.
R:  But -- yeah, I'm amazed to see people all over the country do it.
L:  Yeah.  It's 'cause it's on the internet.
R:  Ooh, okay.
L:  That's how everyone knows.
R:  Okay.  She goes to U Pen so I thought --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- yeah, I guess that's where it's based.  I don't know.
L:  It's -- it's on the internet.  It's on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, oh  money and shopping is what it's called and it's for stay at home moms and you can be a secret shopper.
R:  Huh.
L:  Or for anybody that stays home.  And you could be secret shopper.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, I haven't got much suc- -- much success with it because, um, I live in such a rural area it would take me an hour to two hours to get to any place and they only pay like eight dollars here and there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they'll pay you to go -- they'll pay you forty bucks to go either to Mexican restaurant, this, that and the other.
R:  Really?
L:  It's pretty neat, yeah.  You mi- --
R:  That's where you found it?
L:  Huh?  
R:  At --
L:  No --
R:  Y- you found it --
L:  I found it on the internet.
R:  You found a website that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there were things like that?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I would kill to be a [LAUGH] sec [inaudible] -- what -- what's the website?
L:  Ah, it's money and shopping dot com.
R:  Wow.  I would do that. [NOISE] Because I -- I don't know, I pretty much take classes all the time --
L:  It --
R:  -- or I'm studying somewhere else and so  [LAUGH]
L:  It costs -- it costs forty seven dollars I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To d- -- to -- to get on the website.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not bad.
R:  And then they pay you to be a secret shopper or ?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  These people don't they -- they -- they're -- they show you the companies that would let you be a -- become a secret shopper. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  It's pretty neat.  There's places [NOISE] all over the place that need --
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [NOISE]
L:  -- secret shoppers. [NOISE]
R:  That's pretty cool.
L:  [NOISE] You can go search for apartments and things like.
R:  Nice.
L:  [NOISE] They may be studying how we get off the topic.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] How quickly --
L:  How quickly [NOISE] --
R:  -- these women get off the topic in point two seconds. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They could be studying that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my first conversations -- my first one that I had we stayed on the topic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the whole time.  The second one is about --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- the government is what it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And how corrupt corporate America is.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And I didn't have a lot to say about it.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Actually in my last one was about, um -- was about racism, some  wh- what was it about?  Oh, um, fir- -- affirmative action -- that's what --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was about.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] And so we just -- we w- -- I don't know.  We had a lot to say I guess but we still only lasted about eight out of the ten minutes.
L:  Huh.
R:  I, ah, -- that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't know, our question's kinda corny.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Like, which is the worse habit?  Hm. [LAUGH]
L:  The worst habit.
R:  I don't know.
L:  They can all be bad to a certain de- degree.
R:  I think some of them are just more blatantly degrading to your -- you know, yourself where I guess if you're gossiping the person you're talking about's 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  But everybody to an extent gossips.
R:  I think so.  Yeah.
L:  There's not anyone -- there's not anyone --
R:  Just repeating you som- -- something that [NOISE] even --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- even something true, just repeating it that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- may be something the original question didn't want to be talking about -- yeah.
L:  That's still gossiping because you still turn it around.
R:  Still gossiping.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, I don't -- I don't know, know, know.
L:  But the world wouldn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the world wouldn't go around if we didn't gossip.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How would we know anything?
R:  Yeah.  I guess a lot of what we hear through gossip is not accurate though.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Even on the news it's gossip.  It may be news, it may be factual but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who's to say it's all the truth.
R:  MTV runs these specials called, um, Urban Myths --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Revisited or something like that, where they go over -- I guess, old gossip you know, they go over the whole alligator in the sewer myth and things like that.  And they bring in so called exp- experts and tell you if they think it could be true or if it's just rumor.
L:  Huh.
R:  It's just funny.  I don't know.
L:  I bet that is funny.
R:  Then that really does make the worl- -- I mean, they have -- they interview people from across the entire country and some people out of the country and they've all heard pretty much the same urban legend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that really is [LAUGH] -- it shows you how fast gossip spreads.
L:  Yeah.  It travels fast.  It travels fast.  I know I have a -- I have a, ah, girlfriend that I used to work with.  Her mom was in Wales and she will know gossip from here, and she's in another country, before my friend knows.  She'll know someone's getting a divorce or, you know, someone is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- having marital problems --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or someone had a baby, before my friend knows, and she lives here.
R:  You mean a f- -- you mean, um, a family thing or it's, like, celebrities and things like that?
L:  No, no, no.  This is a family thing.
R:  Oh okay.  Wow.
L:  This is just -- she'll know --
