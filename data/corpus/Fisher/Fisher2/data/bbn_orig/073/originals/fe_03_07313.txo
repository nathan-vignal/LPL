L:  Hello.
R:  H -- Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH]  My name is Mag Fresholds[?] and I live in um Lockport[?] New York outside of Buffalo.
L:  OK, um I'm Kaylin[?], I live about a half an hour outside of New York City in New Jersey.
R:  Oh [LAUGH], okay, so --
L:  What a strange topic [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], have you done this before?
L:  Ah, one time yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too, it was about family.  Okay, I like to do both, I like to eat at restaurants --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- and I like to eat at home too.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, what was the other part? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It was, it was, like describe your perfect meal, or whatever you want to do --
R:  Oh okay the per-, oh my gosh, the per- --
L:  My perfect meal is definitely not cooked at home by me, so [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I definitely do all the cooking --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- at home --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I like to cook but, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- only so much.
R:  Ah, that's funny.  Um, oh god let's see -- perfect meal [MN], perfect meal, I guess probably to go out, you know to go out and to maybe some place I'd been before where I knew what I was going to order --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- and then you know I knew it was going to be good 'cause ah you know, the only thing I hate about going out to eat is that whole period when you're trying to decide what you want.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, "Do I feel like this tonight, or do I feel like that tonight?", [LAUGH] I hate that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] you know and then I'm always, I don't know, you know, I'm always thinking like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- after I get it, "Oh, I should have got the other thing" you know.
L:  Of course, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I go -- I -- my husband and I tend to out about once a week or once every other week --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, just to like -- we try a lot of new places --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I really do notice exactly that, but like eh, when you're going to places you don't know, just a lot of times you do wind up with something you just totally hate --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I would -- it would definitely be some place where I've been before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like many, many times --
R:  Yeah, definitely --
L:  -- where I know everything on the menu, and I know exactly what to expect --
R:  -- and you knew and you could really look forward to that one dish --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then, you know, expect the sides and you know, you just kind of knew a couple of glasses of wine [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly and you know exactly what you're getting ...
R:  That would be the perfect meal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, there's no pressure, it's not so beaut- -- it's not so great that you have feel uncomfortable, you have to get so dressed up -- that's the other thing, I mean, I don't like to -- you know, I don't want to get -- like have to wear an evening gown --
L:  I like dressing up [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I feel all special [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I know, but for the perfect meal -- I like to get dressed up, but for the -- you know, for just --
L:  Yeah right, for the perfect meal you just kinda want to be chilling --
R:  Yeah, you just wanna be --
L:  I'd -- I'd like to look nice, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I have to be like nice looking --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- where my husband has to wear you know khakis instead of jeans --
R:  Oh yeah, exactly, exactly --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, don't get me wrong [LAUGH].
L:  -- but not a tuxedo, yeah, I understand.
R:  [LAUGH] Right, 'cause I, well you know that's nice too 'cause we don't really --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- do that that often you know, but um --
L:  I didn't even get that for my wedding [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] No, no, me either --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah, so that would be, I guess that would be like my perfect meal, just some place, ah, maybe you know, maybe, maybe to look forward to something out, like really nice afterwards too, you know the whole package.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Probably the whole package.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Maybe ah like before the meal, like maybe a spa day [LAUGH].
L:  Wow, you just want to push this [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Wow, it said perfect didn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Your perfect meal involves the entire perfect day [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nothing to do with food [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they said the perfect me- -- you know, I have four kids, I do a lot of cooking, I'm so to- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I can't believe that this is the topic because I was telling one of the girls I work with today that I'm so sick of the food thing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that's all I do is shop and -- you know, shop and cook and replenish, replenish, replenish --
L:  Well, I'm, I'm like a, a newly wed --
R:  Oh so you're --
L:  -- so it's pretty much the same for me, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's just like, ah, but I kinda like it right now, it's kinda like, "Ooh, I get to go to the farmers market every day and see what I'm going to cook tonight", and tonight I made like stuffed mushrooms, and like all this --
R:  Oh that's great.
L: -- but you know I'm loving it you know [LAUGH].
R:  I know.
L:  But I'm sure that'll wear off in like -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- a coupla months [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, no, no, it took me a while [LAUGH], you know I'm married --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for twenty five years so [LAUGH], it's taken me a long time, but you know sometimes it's just -- it's just when you've got a busy life the food thing is -- but I do like to eat at home, I'm a pretty good cook so I -- I like to eat what I cook, and, ah, you know I really like it when, um, you know -- I like to have people in, and, and ah, um, you know, so that's fine too, you know, I suppose I better stay on the topic huh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, um [LAUGH]
L:  Well let's see, who would your perfect meal involve, being there, like who would you want there?
R:  Oh gosh, oh, um, [MN], you know, probably my kids now, 'cause they're all older and probably the whole family, you know --
L:  Okay, that's cool.
R:  -- the whole family would be cool 'cause the youngest is fourteen, the oldest is twenty two and they're all you know, good kids and they can, you know -- before, like a few years ago, it would just be like me and my husband --
L:  Yes [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, but now that they're all getting older and they're finding their girlfriends, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like a gr- a group, a nice group --
L:  Yes
R:  -- where everybody, you know, was getting along, and you know, the kids would really love a perfect meal [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] you know in a really nice r- -- and the perfect meal of course would be paid for by somebody else [LAUGH].
L:  Of course, the perfect meal would just be free --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- you won in it a -- in some contest --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, maybe a lottery ticket attached --
L:  -- and it happened to be at your favorite restaurant, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] so, I think, how about you?
L:  Um, it would just be my husband, we have thi- -- I don't know, every time -- it's really stressful 'cause we're still living with my mother right now, 'cause we don't have enough money so it's like --
R:  Oh, oh yeah well you definitely have to go, yeah --
L:  -- it's hellish [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].

R:  Yeah, I can totally understand that, and you know, when we were like, you know when we were -- when we first got married and we went on our honeymoon we had lots of cute little meals on our honeymoon, so I mean --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and, and we were together for a long time -- five years -- so we had ni-, lots of nice, lots of nice meals and then, you know, the kids come and then you just, you know, it becomes more infrequent --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you can't do that as much --
L:  Of course.
R:  Yeah, but, um, you know, now, you know the kids are older now so we can do 'em, but we don't because we're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- busy, he -- you know, we work, work opposite kind of you know we hardly ever see each other so [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah, I got the exact same thing going, I work all day, he works all night --

L:  Oh man, I think that's what they like though, I think they kind of like want to see how, you know, people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just completely go off topic --
R:  Right.

R:  So, you know --
L:  -- there's, there's only so much you can say about food [LAUGH].

R:  -- there are a lot of nice, there's a lot -- it's a nice little town, you know, there's an, ah, a lot of small little bakeries and things and, and ah, so you know there's always great, you know, things if you're gonna, you know, be bad and eat that stuff [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's always great stuff, so, you know, and sometimes it's just a cup of coffee, and you work at a Starbucks --
L: Yeah, definitely -- but you know what I don't ever want to see coffee again [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When you work at Starbucks you have to know every detail about where coffee comes from, how it's made, how it's roasted --
R:  Yeah, I'm sure it's --
L:  -- all the types, all the countries that make it, what, what the differences are between all the countries, I mean it's crazy --
R:  Oh, so how do they get, how do they, how do you -- do you ju-, do they drill you, or do they give --
L:  You take classes.
R:  You take classes?
L:  You take coffee classes.
R:  So, how many cl-, how many hours a week?
L:  Um, the classes?
R:  The -- no, do you work there.
L:  Oh, I only, right now I can -- I only work the one day because I need to keep it for the fall when I'm going to start working more because my bird place, which I'm working there full time is only -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for the summer --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so right now I'm just working one day a week, but normally --
R:  Now, don't they pay benefits if, if you work twenty hours, that's what I heard?
L:  Yeah, they're, they're an excellent company to work for, my husband works for them, so --
R:   Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm on his insurance so it's fine, like and --
R:  Oh, you're, you're, yeah, you're all set, yeah.
L:  -- he, he works full time there so --
R:  Oh wow, that's great.
L:  It's a really good company.
R:  And how'd you meet -- how'd you meet?
L:  Um, actually at our previous job, we work at two different Starbucks [LAUGH].
R:  [MN]
L:  And we met at a CBS[?] where we both worked [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH] that's so funny --
L:  I know, everybody's like, "Oh, so you met at Starbucks", and we're like, "No". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's so funny.
L:  He just really liked working at one and they didn't need anybody so I got another one that was close --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, and --
L:  There's like ninety Starbucks around here.
R:  And, so where, where, what town do you live in?
L:  It's called Butler, it's um, if you would know anything around here it'd be maybe Patterson[?] or um --
R:  Okay, you're north of the city, or --
L:  I'm -- 
R:  Or -- 
L:  -- pretty much directly due west.
R:  Okay, west.
L:  Um, I'm very north of New Jersey.
R:  Okay, okay --
L:  So --
R:  -- but still in New York State?
L:  It's, it's, I'm about, yeah half an hour from New York State too, I'm not like tippy top[?]
R:  Oh, you're in Pennsylvania?
L:  No, I'm in [LAUGH] I'm in New Jersey.
R:  Oh you're in New Jersey --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh okay, so you're probably pretty [inaudible] -- are you a hockey fan?
L:  Ah, no [LAUGH].
R:  Well, they won [LAUGH].
L:  Sports are nothing for me [LAUGH]
R:  Your team won.
L:  Did they? I -- I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't even know what my team is [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay, how about basketball?
L:  I don't follow any sport --
R:  We --
L:  -- we're very non-sporty people --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we're complete hippie vegan, like --
R:  Ah [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know [LAUGH]
R:  Well, anyway there are a lot of happy people in New Jersey because their hockey team won, you know the New Jersey Devils --
L:  Ah.
R:  And, ah, [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I've heard of them, vaguely.
R:   So when people come in to get coffee, you can say, "Yeah, go devils" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but [LAUGH] um [inaudible]
L:  Most of the people that come into Starbucks [inaudible] are like hippies so I don't --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- think they care either [LAUGH].
R:  So, is it a small town, or a big, you know --
L:  I live in a -- my town is very small, but I'm around a bunch of pretty suburban type cities --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like we're the suburbs of New York, so --
R:  Oh, okay, right, so um, ooh, where was I going with that -- ah, small town, okay, a lot of restaurants?
L:  Um, around here I'm pretty sure it used to be just completely Italian American --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because every restaurant around here is Italian.
R:  Right.
L:  So, like everything, every single restaurant within any area, which is fine with me 'cause I'm half Italian and I love Italian food --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The family side that I was raised by, my mother's side is one hundred per cent Italian so --
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, lucky you.
L:  I guess that's what I like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like my favorite meal would definitely be at one of those Italian restaurants [LAUGH].
R:  Cool.
L:  So --
R:  That's neat, how are we, we must be getting close huh, we've been chattering away --
L:  Yeah.
