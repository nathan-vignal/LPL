L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing fine.  So we're supposed to talk about people with nasty habits right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we are. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But th- there are so many that it's tough to -- tough to limit it.  But 
L:  Okay.  Wel- well, we can start off with mine and go down the list. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] All of the above.  Al- all of the above. [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  Now, what's your opinion?
R:  Um, I'm not a fan of smoking.  I don't smoke --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My family does.  Um, it's one of those habits I've always never found --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- attractive, nor like, or I don't really like to be around people.  But my parents do so it's not like I get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get away from it that much.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  Um 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, yeah, it's -- I don't know it's -- it's not that bad.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The other -- the other ones on the list -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't find as horrible habits because I think I do most of them. 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Um  ah, yeah, there -- there's not a lot on the list.  I -- I think everybody deserves a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bit of -- a little bit of, ah-- argh, what's the word?  Um, leniency when they come to -- like, if you have a hard day at work and you're having a drink --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after work there's nothing wrong with it in my opinion.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um  I don't know, what do you think?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, see, I'm -- am a smoker. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] An- and I -- and I don't drink. [SIGH]  So, i- it's sort of like the same thing you know, that you're talking about it but this is not --
R:  Fair enough.
L:  -- [inaudible] drinking. [SIGH] And it's, [SIGH] ah, smokers I think get a bad rap, you know.  Because you don't light a cigarette really and go out and kill a car f- -- load of fam- -- a family in a car, you know what I mean?  You light --
R:  Very true.
L:  -- a cigarette and beat up your wife. [SIGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  Or -- or abuse your children. [NOISE] And I'm not blaming it all on alcohol.  Alcohol is the excuse.
R:  Yeah and it can be a factor sometimes because people let their drinking get out of control and then they don't control themselves at all, so alcohol is what started the whole mess in the first place.
L:  And they use alcohol.  But, you know what, ah, [MN] well, what is that they say, "A drunk man's actions is a sober man's thoughts", you know.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I believe that.  But I believe everyone of us has a bad habit. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, for sure.
L:  One thing that, [LAUGH] you know, that we really shouldn't be doing according to standards.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But is one really worse than the other? [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  I mean, you know, think about it [NOISE] --
R:  I think --
L:  [NOISE] And it's like pick on this person this week, you know.  Pick on the obese this week, you know, the smokers this week, you know?  And [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.  Every- everybody's got -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody has a weakness I guess.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And n- not -- believe me I'm not saying alcohol or smoking is a weakness but it's a choice of --
L:  It's a --
R:  -- and for some it's not -- it's, ah -- it's, ah -- it's your drink after work.  I have a drink after work, you have a cigarette.  Like, it's not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not saying one is necessarily worse than the other it's just everybody's got their own preference.  I --
L:  Right.
R:  I prefer not to smoke.  I don't want to so I don't.  You don't drink.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's -- it's to each their own I guess.
L:  Yeah.  An- an- and that's like they think [NOISE] that, ah, heavy people are lazy and overeaters.
R:  Yes.
L:  I eat more than a heavy person does.  You know?
R:  Yeah, and I'm a heavy person and I don't eat very much.  So I guess --
L:  Are you -- you --
R:  -- we've even looking at --
L:  You know, but you're discriminated against.  You're --
R:  Yep.  Yeah.
L:  -- lazy, you're not trying, you don't exercise.  It's your fault. 
R:  Mhm.  An- -- 
L:  You know? [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  And it's really funny that if you look at it everybody's got some sort of habit that somebody else looks down upon.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Even, like, there's not a person in the world that at some point isn't discriminated against for what they do or don't do.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Whether it be a habit or not they sit there and, um, the -- the models are too skinny because they don't do this.  They don't have a habit of eating.  They --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- only eat sa- -- like everybody in some form is --
L:  They're disciplined.  It's a discipline.  You know, never mind it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- could be health problem, genetic problem whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] It's strictly a discipline problem. [LAUGH] They don't try.  You know?
R:  Mm.
L:  But [SIGH] the -- I -- you know, I -- I have no problem with drinking. [NOISE] Within r- reason --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I have no problem with the smoking, I have no problem with obesity.  I have no problem with someone who exercises or don't exercise.  Gossips I think is the worse.  You know, off her list that she gave us.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wo- -- I would rather not be around a gossip. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Go- gossip is a very tough one because I think -- I think everybody has their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- definition of what gossip -- like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I think there's a very extreme form of gossip where you tell one person and they run around --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the office telling everybody.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] which I definitely think is uncalled for.  Especially 'cause I think people deserve their privacy.
L:  Yep.
R:  A lot of the time, like, um -- talking to close friends I think, in my opinion, is different to the gossip -- I look at gossip as the overt expression and telling everybody around so it gets spread around so it -- so it's disseminated --
L:  An- -- well, they take a small amou- -- a small amount of the truth, embellish it.  And --
R:  Yes.  Very true.  Very true.
L:  And destroy lives along the way.  You know?  
R:  Yep.
L:  It's not -- gossip is not the same as sitting and chatting about something. 
R:  No.  Very true.
L:  Gossip is maliciously getting on the phone and calling someone to tell them so and so did this.  Did you hear what happened? [SIGH] 
R:  Yep.  
L:  You know, an- and --
R:  Because the story is never the same as the story initially was.  
L:  No.
R:  It's -- there's always something different -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about it.  Even if it's not an intentional embellishment, it's just a miscommunication from the first person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's, like, that way on the telephone.  It just goes down the line and it's nothing like what happened at the very beginning.
L:  Exactly.  And then there's hurt people along the way.  
R:  Yeah.  Oh, most certainly.
L:  Innocent victims along the way.  [SIGH] So, like I said, you know, I have no problem with anybody else and their habits except for gossip. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's one of the most painful because -- because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of how it can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how it can hurt the people involved in both the beginning and end of the gossip or the people along the way, 'cause if the gossip was even about somebody and it wasn't intended to be about somebody.  Like, just a misunderstanding.
L:  It will be before it's over with.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And, yeah, that -- that is a habit that people need to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- avoid in mass amounts and, like, in getting -- in [SIGH]-- like I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, I'll talk to my best friend about things that are -- but that's -- that's more of a conversation as opposed to, ah, malicious --
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  -- intent to get this information out and pass it around.
L:  That's right.  Gossip is not a chat. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Gossip is going out of your way to --
R:  Very true.
L:  -- you know, really say something bad [NOISE] about someone.  You're not spreading good news.  That is not gossip.  
R:  No.  
L:  You know? [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  Most certainly.  
L:  Except for when you --
R:  I don't know if it c- -- I don't know if it can be considered a bad habit and I know she didn't list it, but people being really mean.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't if, like, mean and rudeness is a habit but some of the people I know it's their way of life, so it seems like a habit, you know? 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  And I think that's just --
L:  No, I just think they enjoy it so much. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Because they will be nice to other people. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can see 'em be nice to some people.
R:  Yes.  Very true.
L:  But, I don't know -- ah, yeah, we've [NOISE] [SIGH] -- ah, people think that all southerners are laid back, you know and all polite but we're not. 
R:  Yes.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  An- and, you know, the same way with Yankees, you know.  The media has done that but [SIGH] -- yeah, being rude and nasty when it's uncalled for.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]  The -- the -- the media I think in itself is a bad habit.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They're the worst at gossiping.  They're the worst at putting these, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bad habits into our head.  They are -- they're just hideous.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And you can't stop watching. [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  And you know half [NOISE] of what you hear is not going to be a fact. [NOISE]
R:  Yep.
L:  But [NOISE] --
R:  But it's so hard to sift through, ah, everything that's told to you whether it's a fact or not.  You don't know at some point who to trust and what to believe.
L:  [NOISE] But you need to be informed.  This is why they have [MN] -- have us in the position we're in, we need to be informed. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] You know.  We really --
R:  Need to make sure.
L:  [NOISE] -- need to -- and, I don't know.  It's just [LAUGH] -- but like I said I have no problem with any of the other bad habits.  Gossips in my opinion is the worst habit. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.  As- -- a- as the definition of a habit because the rest seem to be on par with each other. 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Your cigarette is my drink.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, you know.
L:  You know, I think it's a --
R:  It's -- it's like, just --
L:  -- [NOISE] it's a stress reliever. [NOISE]
R:  Exact- --
L:  You know. [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  Like I'll ex- -- that is -- that is part of my joy to the week --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is going out for a few drinks with friends.  And I'm not talking, like, a drunken --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- brawl night, like, that's just out of control but, a -- a couple of drinks at a pub with friends.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There's nothing with that.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Anything to release, you know -- but, [MN] someone sitting with a drink in their hand cannot be coming down on people with a cigarette in their hand.  You know what I mean?  I would -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be more concerned about the person ordering four Manhattan's [SIGH] than the one lighting a Marlboro. 
R:  Yes.  Very true.
L:  You [LAUGH] -- you know?
R:  Very true.  I -- I would be -- I would be more scared of a drunk than I would a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- habitual smoker.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  There's -- there's no doubt about that.
L:  But -- but that's not to say any of it is good for you.  I mean, you know --
R:  No.
L:  -- within -- in moderation [NOISE] I don't think anything will really hurt you.  It's the going overboard with it that really causes the problem.  [SIGH] But my problem is the prejudice against [NOISE] everybody out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yo- [LAUGH] you know there's a group --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- against us all. [SIGH]
R:  Of for sure.  There's no- -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- nobody's happy with anybody in the world.  It's --
L:  [LAUGH]
