L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Ah, hi, I'm John Hawkstone from Indi.
R:  Hi, I'm Lauren and I'm from Connecticut.
L:  Ah, nice to talk to you.
R:  How are you?
L:  Um, oh, I'm ill because the seasons have changed, I guess.
R:  You are?
L:  No, I'm just kidding.
R:  Oh, I was like, no way. [LAUGH] Um, I am not ill.  I don't get ill when the seasons change, do you?
L:  Nope.  Not at all.
R:  I don't, but knock on wood, hopefully I won't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I've been sick once this winter, so, and that was awful.
L:  I actually got fucking strep throat three times this year.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I can't believe it.
R:  I didn't have strep?
L:  Huh?
R:  I don't -- I think I had, I don't remember what I had.  I had a bladder infection.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Along with it though, and like, horrible sinuses and they gave me one pill to kill it all and I couldn't -- and I was, like, what?  
L:  Did it work?
R:  And they gave me -- yeah, it worked great.
L:  That's crazy.
R:  It was incredible.  So, that question, if a cold lasts a week when you go to the doctor and a week if you don't, I don't agree with it, because I always seem to take a lot of drugs to get better.
L:  Yeah.  For me, I don't know, it seems like ah, half the time I -- I -- I don't know, I can always tell.  I know that many times I can just get better on my own --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but I can always -- I can always tell if that's the case, and if I have something like strep, well I need to go to the doctor and get some antibiotics.  That was crazy though, 'cause I hadn't had strep in like, seven years, maybe.
R:  That's strange.  Yeah, I know a lot of people who had strep this year.  It must be going around.  Like, my throat hurts right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't think it's anything to be concerned about.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, besides that I -- I don't think that when I get a cold -- a lot of people start taking Echinacea.  I think that makes me worse, because I did that --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and it made my -- it made my symptoms worse.  I was drinking orange juice and taking vitamin C and whatever.  They don't work for me.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I don't know --
R:  But I take --
L:  None of that stuff seems to work for me, and Echinacea, I mean -- I mean, any of those herbs I'm just like, what the fuck?  That does not do anything.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My mom takes a ton of them though, like, probably twenty, thirty pills a day -- 
R:  Of what?
L:  -- and shoves them in my hands when I come over.  I don't know, herbs, like Saint John's Wart, vitamin C, vitamin B twelve, and vitamin B six, and vitamin D, whatever, you know, just a handful of --
R:  Yeah, I take about --
L:  -- things like bee pollen, I'm like --
R:  Oh really.
L:  -- crazy.
R:  I don't -- I don't do the herbs but I take probably about twenty vitamins a day, and people at work think I'm nuts because I have them all in my drawer, and um --
L:  You take twenty vitamins a day?
R:  Almost twenty vitamins a day.
L:  Well, I'm sorry for just saying my mom was crazy for that but --
R:  Oh, no, no, no.  People think I'm crazy and I probably am, because some days I feel horrible, and I'm like, I think I over -- overdosed on the vitamins.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, yesterday I had a horrible migraine because I took way too many, so it can be good and bad.  Today I only took, like, four or five --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of the ones I really like.  But my problem is, I take one a day which has --
L:  The ones that you really like?  Do they do something for you?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I just feel better.
L:  Mm.
R:  I take um, one a day with everything in it then I pump up on vitamin C, vitamin, um E, Beta-carotene, folic acid --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, the fish oils, because I'm a vegetarian, that's another reason why I take them, so --
L:  Ah.
R:  I feel that maybe it helps me ward off sickness.
L:  You're allowed to eat fish oil if you're a vegetarian?  How's that?
R:  Ah, actually it's not fish oil it's actually just, um, it's called Omega three and Omega six.
L:  Okay.
R:  So it's not actual fish oil, but it's the same nutrients that you would get from fish.
L:  Okay, I understand.  I understand.
R:  I don't really understand it all that well but, um, have you ever done these calls before?
L:  Hm?
R:  Have you ever done these calls before?
L:  Yeah, I took two of 'em before.
R:  Um, have you ever gotten paid for them?
L:  Uh-huh.  What about you?
R:  Me neither.
L:  Wh- -- how many calls do you have to do, like, three calls or something?
R:  Oh, and then you get paid.  I thought you had to do -- okay, I thought you got paid each call.  I was just wo- -- I was just curious.
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I thought -- or maybe you do get paid each call and -- I've only done it for a week, or something.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I keep missing the calls, but anyway, I just wanted to interrupt real quick.  Um, what was the other question they had?  I forget what the other question was. [LAUGH] We could probably talk about it if we did.
L:  What's that?
R:  I said, I don't know what else to talk about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't get sick.  My mom gets really sick and the girl next to me at work sneezes, like, two thousand times in a row, and she never stops all day long and I feel bad for her because she must run out of energy from sneezing or something.
L:  [LAUGH] So, how many of these calls have you taken before?
R:  How many have I?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just one, and that was on foreign policy.
L:  On what?
R:  Foreign policy.
L:  Oh yeah.  Man, I had one on something like, ah, on like, white collar corporate crime and crime in the stock market and how it affects our lives negatively --
R:  That sounds cool.
L:  -- and me and the other guy were like, what the fuck?
R:  There must be a lot of um, research going on because I get calls all the time but I always miss them because I'm at work, or I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somewhere else, so I mean, at least they keep still calling me.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah, that's cool.
R:  Yeah, hopefully I'll get paid some day. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, there's like, a limit of how many times you can take calls, right?
R:  Oh really, I didn't know that.  I didn't know.
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I'm trying to r- -- do you have -- do you know what the web page is for it where I can ah, because I forget where I fucking signed up for it.
R:  Nah.  I found it on Craig's list.
L:  What?
R:  Craig's list.  It's like a New York based directory.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  It wasn't really a website, so 
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  We'll probably get in trouble for not talking about the topic. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, ah --
R:  I don't think they care though.  Um --
L:  No.  When I was supposed to be talking to that guy about white collar ah, crime, corporate crime and the stock market crime and how it affects us, we're both like, agh.
R:  Yeah, you don't know it, right?  Yeah.  I wouldn't know it either.
L:  Yeah, whatever, and we started talking about rain and shit until, yeah.
R:  Yeah, there is a margin of error we can fit into that. [LAUGH] We talked a lot about colds and stuff though.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  I think -- actually I think the thing's probably studying communication as much as anything else.
R:  Probably, yeah, because I mean, one of the girls was from Texas and sh- -- I don't know how old she was, but she was in the army and I had nothing in common with her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, I live in New York so I basically live in New York City.  I work in New York City and where did you say you were from?  Indiana?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I was born in Washington but --
R:  Washington, DC?
L:  State.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, what do you do there?
L:  I go to school and I teach a [inaudible] class --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- and I'm a computer life[?] consultant --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- and I just got, like, ah, one of my first um, freelance art jobs done.  Just drawn some pictures.
R:  Nice, congratulations.  That's cool.  I work in advertising in New York City.
L:  Oh yeah.  How's that?
R:  [LAUGH] I was going to do -- no, I'm participating in these studies, but I always like, want to do something extra, on the side, you know, like, to make more money.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And I mean, I'm a student too, so you know, I'm broke.
R:  Yeah, I just graduated last year, so I'm pretty much a student too.
L: Oh cool.  Did you go to school there?  I was thinking about going there for grad school in art of something.
R:  I went to George Washington actually, in DC.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I just moved up here.
L:  Yeah.  DC's a pretty cool place.  I was there for --
R:  New York's awesome, especially for art.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Parsons and anywhere where else, NYU and the New York School of Design, they're all great places.  It's such a great cultural place.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, one of my teachers told me, he said like, that should be my first choice, is to go there.  I think NYU and um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then the second, Chicago, so I'm just discussing with those schools and 
R:  Cool.  I liked Chicago too, but New York is definitely the best. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, the first time I went there it was like ah, I think last year, or maybe -- maybe two summers ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it just -- it kicked ass.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My brother and I went up there, and some buddy of ours from Pennsylvania.  We just walked the streets and stayed up all night and just kind of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fucking blast.  It was cool. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's great, yeah.  Every summer in college I would come up here and intern, so it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- awesome, so eventually I moved up there.  It's great. [LAUGH] 
L:  I couldn't believe how -- I mean, we just went there, no, like, special occasion or anything, and it's like, Times Square at midnight it's fucking packed.  It was wonderful.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I used to work in Times Square at MTV and then -- I don't miss that though, because the tourists there were crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was wild.
L:  How long would it take you to get to work, or did you live close?
R:  Um, well at that time I lived in the city so it was very easy, but from right now, it takes me about an hour to get there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which kind of sucks because I get up and go to the gym.  It's like, tomorrow, I'm getting up at like, four thirty in the morning.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I should be asleep right now.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So as soon as this is over I'm going to sleep, it's like, ten thirty.
L:  Oh, people only really need like, five hours of sleep a night.
R:  I have to get like, seven.  It's just that [several inaudible words] Some long eight minutes.  Jesus. [LAUGH] 
L:  What's that?
R:  It's a long eight minutes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because we're not talking about the topic, that's why. [LAUGH] They're like, we're going to keep these people on the phone until they talk about it.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Um, my guess is that they, you know, maybe care somewhat about the question, but --
R:  Yeah, that's a good guess.
L:  -- but they're just checking out like, how people communicate in such a fucking random, weird situation to where they're like, here, talk to this stranger about something.
R:  It's funny, but it's really interesting, because I mean, I have pretty good conversations with -- I mean, I've only done two --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- like it's not like ooh, ooh. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  It's cool.  But ah, I also drink tea to stay healthy. [LAUGH] 
L:  What?  Oh, drink tea.
R:  I drink tea.  I drink like, gallons of tea.
L:  Yeah.  I drink a lot of tea, but I pretty much don't do anything to stay healthy.  I do lots of things that are unhealthy.
R:  Oh, see, I don't smoke or do drugs.  I drink a lot, but that's for work.  I have to do it for work. [LAUGH] 
L:  You have to do it for work?
R:  Yeah, we go to a lot of like, free events and things because, I don't know --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- the magazines take us and stuff, so it's --
L:  So do I.  I go to those art shows, free booze.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Wonderful.
R:  It gets to be interesting
