R:  Hello?
L:  Hey.
R:  Hey.  Where're you calling from? [NOISE]
L:  I'm calling from Jacksonville, Florida.  How about you?
R:  Ah, Wilmington, Delaware. [NOISE]
L:  Cool. 
R:  Yes.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm Brandon.
R:  So, ah -- ah, the topic is habits? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Which is, like, worse.
R:  Which is worse, they're saying? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  It was, like -- the listed a whole lot of stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like tobacco, drinking, gossiping, smoking.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  All that stuff. [NOISE]
R:  Why -- wh- why don't you give me your ideas on this? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I don't -- I don't think any of them are particularly bad.  I think that, you know, as long as you know the risks involved in any habits you're participating in, you know, there's no downside --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause you know the risk and that -- well, that sucks for you.  So 
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think that -- yeah, like you said, I don't hate the person for doing it but I certainly don't really associate on a intimate basis or even -- too much with smokers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just find that they make my clothes stink.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  It's -- it's their clothes or -- or, like, in a closet and it's hanging next to mine.
L:  Yeah.  I have to agree, the smell does bother me a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, you know, they -- they receive a lot of surface stigma.  Like, here in Florida?  
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  Ah, they just passed a bill into the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- state legislator a few months ago stating that, um, no --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- restaurants can be smoking any more.  
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  If you serve food and you've -- no one's allowed to smoke in the restaurant.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Which --
R:  Yeah.  But, we have that here.
L:  Really?
R:  [MN] You can't smoke in any restaurant. [NOISE]
L:  What do you think about that?
R:  Ah, I -- I lov- -- I love it. [NOISE]
L:  Really?
R:  [NOISE] I mean, I -- I love it.  I think that people should not smoke in restaurants at all.  In fact --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- anything that's not outside should be banned. [NOISE] I'm really --
L:  What about, like, bars?
R:  Huh?
L:  What about bars?
R:  Bars I'd -- I really don't think they should smoke in there either.  I mean, there --
L:  Why's that?
R:  -- there's -- there's a lot of people here who, um, [MN] ah, caused an uproar, where, you know, in bars people wanted to smoke and they denied it.  They said, "You -- it's not gonna happen".  And, if --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the people do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, smoke the other people call on that and they send a -- an enforcement officer and the -- the bar actually is fined a tremendous amount of money for that.
L:  Mm.
R:  So --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't -- I don't, you know -- an- and they're saying, "Well, if the same thing as, ah, as the drinking", I don't agree with that.  I think if, ah, somebody's drinking it's not -- I'm not ingesting it.  If they're smoking I'm ingesting it.
L:  That's true.  
R:  So.
L:  I jus- -- I just have a prob- [MN] problem with it on, like, the share --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- capitalist level to think establishments --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like bars and restaurants should be able to choose whether they allow, um, customers to be able to smoke.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think that, um, [MN] ah, yeah -- I mean, in a way I understand but in a way I think that, ah, people like myself who abhor it -- both my parents died of cancer from cigarette smoke. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Smoking themselves.  [NOISE] And, I hate it and I've hated it since I was kid. [NOISE] And, I can't enjoy listening to music, or dancing, or going t- -- out to dinner because somebody's gonna light up next me. [NOISE] I mean, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I feel that they're the ones can get on their little feet and go outside. [NOISE]
L:  That's true.
R:  [MN] It's like you cannot get in and out of these places.  I mean, they stamp your hand, or whatever it is, to go in and out [NOISE] and I think that it's just, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, not a, um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] not a good thing for, ah -- ah, people to have to smell it. [NOISE]
L:  That's true.  I just --
R:  So  [NOISE]
L:  -- think that people, you know, obviously have the decision --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when your going to a -- ah, establishment --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like that to, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- choose to or not.  And --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- I think the only reason I'm getting upset about it is because there's this really great place around here that's a Middle Eastern restaurant.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, they have, um, these huge hookah pipes and they -- these people can smoke flavored tobacco and things like that and there's --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- nicotine in it or anything like that.  But because of the smoking ordinance --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have to get rid of the hookah pipes whenever it's taking effect.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's upsetting me because I enjoy, like smoking the hookah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's something, you know, you like to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I think that's, ah, becoming less and less an issue here.  I mean, in the beginning they were -- [NOISE] people were in uproar and all this.  But I think people are respectful.  I've been in restaurants where a- -- before they had dessert people would go out and smoke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they actually are setting up tables outside and they have to be a certain amount of -- from the door.  And, ah, they set them up and they come out there and have a -- a puff and go back in, you know.  It's no big deal. [NOISE] But, ah, I -- I certainly wo- -- applauded the day that they did this. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, and, ah, the, um -- Florida is a whole lot -- [SIGH] a lot more -- and then also I'm thinking of demographics.  I think Delaware has a younger population than Florida would. [NOISE]
L:  And that's probably true.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, and a lot of the people here, even in their workplaces, they didn't allow smoking years ago so they probably got used to it. [NOISE]
L:  That makes sense.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] So 
L:  I find it very interesting that on, um, this question of the day with habits they included a bunch of stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, you know, alcohol --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tobacco and that kind of thing.  And then they included gossiping.
R:  Gossiping? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  You know I didn't hear that. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  It was the first --
R:  I -- I -- I thought they said -- I -- you know, I -- I was listening to it but that lady talks a little bit low. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And I didn't hear gossiping.  Gossiping.
L:  Yeah.  It was the first one.  It's -- it was -- I found it peculiar because, you know, you have all these habits that people are --
R:  Gossiping. [NOISE]
L:  -- actively participating in and gossiping's kinda vague.  You know?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] well, I know that both the men and women are guilty of that [NOISE] and, ah, I -- I think -- I don't know what -- I think there's good gossiping and there's, ah, really evil gossiping. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, if [NOISE] somebody's laughing about somebody's hair [NOISE] cut or something I don't think that's such a big deal, but when someone's, [NOISE] you know, laughing about somebody's ha- -- you know, ah, very intimate habits I don't think that's good. [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I sort [MN] of, the only thing I have with the gossiping is just if it's very general and vague --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause again you can be gossiping about someone's hair cut or, something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you have no idea about.  And, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just find it odd they included that in bad habits.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that -- that's an interesting point.  I didn't think about that. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what'd you think about gossiping? [NOISE]
L:  I think it's, ah, healthy actually a lot of the time when you do it, like in a controlled --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- situation where you're not revealing intimate secrets about someone, you know?  Everyone talks of the --
R:  Yeah and like you're saying there's good and bad. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Everyone talks about their friends, like, a little bit when they're not around and in theory that could be consisted gossiping, but I --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- don't think it's a bad habit, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I think --
L:  Is --
R:  -- that sometimes it's just the way it is. [NOISE] I mean, if somebody's [SIGH] doing something to somebody and they are not telling that person, it's just a venting of it [NOISE] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] to somebody else.  But, I mean, if somebody was making up down right lies I think that's evil.  An- [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.  It's definitely not a good thing.
R:  [NOISE] So, I -- I think that, ah, [NOISE] um, I would -- I would be upset with that.
L:  Yeah.  I still don't know if I'd consider it a bad habit though.  I know some people who --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do gossip habitually.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, I don't know --
R:  Maybe they're -- maybe they're thinking of people that -- that do this and they -- they actually do this as, like, a sport. [NOISE]
L:  How so?
R:  Well, I -- I would think that there are some people who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, um, just want to churn the pot. [NOISE]
L:  That's true.
R:  [NOISE] And, ah, I've -- I've known people in my work atmosphere like this.  No matter what happens they will think of an angle to -- to, ah, mix th- -- churn the pot a little bit.  Stir the pot I should say.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So, that's just something that, ah, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] I don't think is, ah, a bad thing but because sometimes you get really good ideas out of people stirring up stuff.
L:  Definitely.
R:  So, I don't know if, ah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [SIGH] all gossiping's bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is this the first time you've done this? [NOISE]
L:  No.  I did one of it before.
R:  Oh, you di- -- yeah, I had another question the other day about, um, things. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I even had to talk about, um, corporate corruption the other day.  So 
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  How -- what di- -- what did you think about that?
L:  Yeah.  So 
R:  That's a -- it's a big problem for sure.
L:  Definitely.  But 
R:  So, um, -- [SIGH] and what -- what was the other one, drinking right?
L:  Yeah.  Drinking.  And we have to figure, like, which we think is worse.  And again, I don't think tha- -- kinda like, any worse when I think there're a lot, like -- there're negative consequences, like, you know, smoking obviously has the social stigma attached to it.  There's lung cancer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There's m- m- -- very importantly --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cost associated with it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, you know, gossiping has social stigma attached to it I suppose because if you're a horrible gossip people don't want to reveal any secrets to you.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.  No, I understand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Um, I -- I just don't know whether [NOISE] -- I -- I think smoking and drinking are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two different things, like, that people say that's, like, a- -- two bad habits.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think there's [SIGH] -- drinking only a- a- affects the person that's drinking.  And if they don't drive and they just lay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the floor who cares.  But if somebody's smoking it just affects everything. [NOISE]
L:  That's true.
R:  It's, um [NOISE] --
L:  Although, you do get a lot of belligerent drunks and they can be affecting other people around them --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What I'm saying is, is it doesn't a- a- a- -- if they sit in a chair and go to sleep or something or pass out, it's not, like, their booze is getting into your body. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess what I'm -- I'm looking upon that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Secondhand smoke definitely does --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mhm.
L:  -- only does create some consequence of some sort
