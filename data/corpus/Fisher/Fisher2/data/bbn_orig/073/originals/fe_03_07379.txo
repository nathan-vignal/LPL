L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  I'm Sandra.
L:  Hi Sandra.  My name is Donna.
R:  Hi.  Nice to meet you. 
L:  You too.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You too.  I didn't quite catch all of the -- the, um, i- items -- which was worse.  Did you?
R:  Um, just a few.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I got gossiping, smoking --
L:  So did I.  Gossiping and --
R:  Alcohol. [LAUGH]
L:  And alcohol, and what was the last one?
R:  Um, I think overeating.  And I didn't get any others so 
L:  Okay.  All right.  Well, we should discuss what we think is worse.  How about we d- -- we deal with those four.  Overeating, gossiping, smoking and alcohol.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  All Right.
R:  Good idea.
L:  Well, I'm gonna ask you first.  How's that?
R:  Yeah.  That's good.
L:  What -- what -- what do you think is worse out of those four, um, items?
R:  Um, I'd say alcohol.  Definitely.  Because, I mean, you can kill people whereas gossiping probably ruins somebody's character, but --
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, what about you?  What do you think?
L:  Well, y- -- I think, um -- I think they're all pretty bad. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] I think they're all pretty bad.
R:  In degrees. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, although alco- alcohol in moderation to me is okay.  I, um, personally I drink a glass of wine with my meals.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I, um, [LIPSMACK] um -- for example, red wine is a natural antioxidant. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And it can be very healthy.  If you ever have to go to the doctor and they tell you that you need more iron in your blood, they'll tell you to drink red wine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But alcohol to excess would definitely be -- be up -- high up there on the list.
R:  Mm.
L:  Ah, I agree because it [COUGH] -- it can cause all kinds of, um, different, ah, ramifications in life.
R:  Yes.
L:  Death, illness.  But I think if I were to pick one out of the three -- if I had to, um, I would probably pick smoking.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Because I can't think if there was anything good about smoking.
R:  That's true actually.  You know, because alcohol does have some good benefits, whereas --
L:  It --
R:  -- smoking damages you and people around you who are -- who are breathing in your, um, y- -- side stream smoke.
L:  Exactly.  With alcohol it, um -- alcohol in moderation, um, wouldn't be as worse as -- a- -- wo- -- wouldn't be as worse [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because smoking is really, ah, a terr- -- a terrible, ah, personal habit, a terrible activity.
R:  Mm.
L:  Not only to yourselves but to everyone around you.
R:  Mm.  Mm.
L:  Um, so I -- I -- I really do think smoking is -- I can't -- I can't think of one good thing that smoking --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- really produces, um, in a -- in a person or other people around them.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  And I -- I -- why don't we pick a second choice off that list.  Th- -- so wh- -- are -- you've a- -- you've -- you've -- you've, um, chosen alcohol as the first?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Would smoking be -- or what would be your next -- 
R:  Um 
L:  -- second worst then?
R:  I'd say smoking.  
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  I'd say smoking.  Um 
L:  All right.  My second -- why would you say smoking by the way before I tell you what I think?  You tell me my you think smoking would be, um, second on your list.
R:  Well, I think it's -- I mean, one you can -- you can -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause, you know, you damage your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your lungs and you can get cancer and -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things like that.  Um, so it's got negative effects whereas -- you know, compared to the others.  Overeating, well, you're just being greedy.  I can't see [LAUGH] --
L:  That's right. [LAUGH]
R:  I can't see anything ne- negative -- well, other than you don't look so good and you're -- you're health can be compromised.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But it doesn't have the same effect as smoking and the same with gossiping is, you know, gossip is not necessarily good but it may not necessarily get back to that person.
L:  That's true.
R:  Whom you gossip about.  So, um, if they hear about it and it's very malicious it might, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hurt them, ah, it could ruin their career perhaps at the -- at a very extreme level.
L:  Yes.  That's true.
R:  Um 
L:  That's true.
R:  You know.
L:  It's, ah, gossiping is very destructive though.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It is.  And it ruins friendships --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it ruins all, um, types of personal, um, relationships.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I suppose the object of this conversation was which one is worse then.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So we have picked the top two that I think we s- -- I think we -- we agree that th- the top two --
R:  Smoking and alcohol.  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Um, [LIPSMACK] um, overeating is -- is very bad for your health, um, and, ah, can cause all kinds of health problems down the road.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Overeating is probably the result of other problems in one's life or it could be genetic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I -- I -- I don't know about you but I had gossiping. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I al- -- I almost took -- I almost took a look at the list and put that at the top. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well.
L:  But -- well, I had to be r- -- I had to be realistic and logical --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- about -- about the list and -- and, um, say well, okay that's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not right is it? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- but I don't know about you but I -- I think when somebody gossips it's -- it's just so destructive.
R:  Yep.  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever had, ah, any -- any experience with gossipy people?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And, um, you just don't know what to say.  Um, I find myself in a situation when I'm listening to people gossiping about other people that I know -- I feel very uncomfortable because I don't know what to say to them.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, yeah.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  And -- and I don't want to hear those things either 'cause then that puts me the situat- -- you know, a very uncomfortable situation.
L:  It is although sometimes when somebody's gossiping about something it's like a car crash, you -- you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you go by and you don't [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know you shouldn't be looking but you can't help but look. [LAUGH]  So, you listen. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I like how you put that. 
L:  It's true.  It's human nature.  It's true, you know --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- it's human nature.  But I hate it -- it really is one thing about -- I think, as -- as I get older in my life, is that I -- I just don't have time for is -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is gossip.  Ideal gossip.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um 
R:  I -- I think that that sums it up exactly, is that it's a waste of -- and everybody's time.  Um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to hear it and to -- to take part in it.  It doesn't help anybody.  It doesn't improve anything.
L:  No, it doesn't.
R:  Um -- Yeah.
L:  I agree.  So why do you think so many people smoke and drink?  I mean, they're the worst two but why -- why -- I don't know, why do you think people [NOISE] get into these habits that are clearly no -- n- -- of no, ah -- they're clearly no good for them?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think it's -- it's -- it's the chemicals in them that, you know, they're clearly addictive.  Um, and then --
L:  They're both --
R:  -- you have families who -- where the father is an alcoholic and the son is an alcoholic and so on and so on.
L:  Yes.
R:  And you know, they say that they're people who are predisposed to becoming alcoholics.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So I think that that's, you know, bad chemistry, bad -- bad luck.  You try it and then --
L:  You're hooked.
R:  -- you're down a slippery road.  Yeah.  And the same with cigarettes.  I mean --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- those are clearly addictive and you start at sixteen because you think it's cool.
L:  That's very true.
R:  And twenty years later you're struggling to quit and you can't.
L:  Exactly. [SIGH]
R:  Yes.  I -- I think that also makes -- that's another reason why they're probably at the top of my list as well is because of that danger.
L:  That's a very good point, you know.  [LIPSMACK] That's a very good point.  Because they are both -- they are both very addictive activities.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can't just pick up a cigarette and smoke it for a few days or a few weeks and then s- -- and then stop it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unless you really hate the activity.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  Um, alcohol is a little less problematic I suppose if you're a casual drinker, or you're a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- social drinker.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Ah, um, [LIPSMACK] however -- I mean, th- the -- the -- the thing about the two of them though is for peop- -- for a lot of people there's a lot of pleasure in both of those activities.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're good for you but they're bad for you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you smoke or drink?
R:  No.  No.  Neither.
L:  You don't?
R:  No.
L:  You don't drink any alcohol at all?
R:  No.  I used but I don't anymore.
L:  Oh.  Well, good for you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Good for you. [LAUGH]  I can't -- I can't claim [NOISE] the same [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah, example but, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I certainly don't drink excessively but I -- I do drink a glass of wine with meals.
R:  Mm.  Which is fine, um --
L:  It is.
R:  And there are lots of -- I mean, I -- I know lots of people say it -- it helps -- you know, it tastes -- the food is made better and tastes nicer with a good wine.
L:  That's true.
R:  But I just -- I never enjoyed the taste of alcohol when I did drink so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't see -- and that's why I don't drink now, it's really a taste issue rather than a moral issue or a religious issue or --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's -- that's, um, that's your own preference and you clearly don't care for it --
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  -- which is -- and smoking, well, I don't smoke either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I -- I know a lot of people who do but I -- I feel very badly -- very, very badly for people who do.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It -- it -- 
R:  Did you, um, did you have a lot of pressure when you were younger to stop smoking and make a conscious decision not to, or was --
L:  [SIGH] I never started.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I never started.  I -- I never did smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And what about you?
R:  No.  No.  But a lot -- I think almost all my friends did smoke.  Um --
L:  Ah!
R:  And there was a lot of -- I mean, it -- well, when I was much younger --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- sort of in my teens and early twenties, um, everybody had a cigarette when you go out to lunch or you go out clubbing --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and they pass around their cigarette. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  And there's -- there's a lot of pressure I think for young people to say no and avoid smoking.
L:  [SIGH] Well, this is just it.  It's the peer pressure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's how you get hooked. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and unfortunately it's not something that can be stopped immediately.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think it wou- -- it takes -- [MN] do you -- would you agree that if in -- in -- in alcohol's case that if you have a family member who has been an alcoholic or you're --
