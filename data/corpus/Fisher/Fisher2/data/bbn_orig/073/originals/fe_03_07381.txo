R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  This is Laurie.  How --
L:  This -- this -- this is Chase.
R:  Chase?  Glad to talk to you.  We have a fun topic today, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you done many of these calls?
L:  Ah, this is the first one.
R:  Oh, good.  I think this is my third.
L:  Okay.
R:  They keep calling and I keep being too busy so I thought --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well, I call in and do it. [SIGH] Um, what do you think is the worst --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- of the ?
L:  I think smoking. [NOISE]
R:  Ah, it -- it just would have to be between smoking and drinking, wouldn't it?
L:  Yes.
R:  It would seem like --
L:  Ahah.
R:  But I think smoking -- like, say smoking seems like it would be hard to quit.  I -- I don't smoke so --
L:  Right.  I don't either but I just think smoking --
R:  I -- I do too.
L:  -- would be hardest.
R:  It seems like it would be the hardest to quit with that nicotine --
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  There must be something in it that makes you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not able to. [SIGH] You know there is another thought, though, um, I heard -- 'cause I'm trying to diet and they said the overeating or not exercising.  With smoking or drinking if you decide to quit I th- -- you can just stop.  I mean, [MN] you can still live but with eating you just can't stop eating. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, even though that's not the worst habit I still think that --
L:  I'm trying to gain weight.
R:  Ooh. [LAUGH] I wish we could get together.  We could, like, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd give you some of mine. [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm not, you know, huge or obese but I just --
L:  Yes.
R:  I could lose a few pounds and boy, it's hard.  It's -- it's the hardest thing.  So I can't imagine quitting smoking or --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- drinking.
L:  I have a friend, um, that I used to, ah, run around with and she had smoked for, like, ten years.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  And -- I mean, she's still trying to stop and -- I mean, if she gets to, ah, sometimes to where she, like, just cries because --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- it's just so hard for her to stop.
R:  That's very sad.
L:  Ahah.
R:  But y- -- when -- I -- I just think it's so nasty.  [SIGH] You smell so much like it --
L:  Oh, you do.  Oh --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- my goodness.  People come in from --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- like, when -- after a class or whatever --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and they'll go outside and smoke [SIGH] and they come back in and that -- it just stinks.
R:  I just think --
L:  And I couldn't stand that smell so I was --
R:  I just don't wonder do they not realize how they smell and --
L:  Too right.
R:  -- when I take me kids to school you can tell the kids that their parents smoke and --
L:  Ahah.
R:  Argh, oh it's just -- yeah, it's really na- -- it's a nasty, nasty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- habit.  And then when I see parents, with a baby, smoking that just irritates me to no end --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't like to see that at all.
L:  I know.
R:  And, you know, they -- they did mention gossiping is one.  I know that can hurt people's feelings really badly but --
L:  Well, it can.  But, I mean, you can --
R:  But that's not --
L:  -- kinda ignore the gossip.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's --
R:  It's not bad for your health really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I wouldn't think.
L:  Right.
R:  And the not exercising -- are you in school?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
R:  Oh.  So you get your exercise probably --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- walking around, don't you?
L:  Yes I do.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] Well, I think I agree with you that smoking's probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, one of the worst habits but -- but I'm sure it's hard -- I wonder if any of those patches work?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, my friend she's used a patch -- I mean, she used to take --
R:  It didn't work?
L:  -- the gum and everything, it just doesn't.
R:  None of that worked for her at all?
L:  No.  But it seems [NOISE] like when she [NOISE] thinks that she has it licked maybe something would happen and she's just, like, "I couldn't " -- you know, like her, um, boyfriend or whatever [LIPSMACK] they were having problems [NOISE] and she was like, "He just got me so upset".  You know, and she ran to a cigarette so 
R:  Oh, my.  But now, see that's what I do with the eating.  Is -- is she thin? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is she a thin person?
L:  Yeah.  She's really thin.
R:  Well, see a lot --
L:  You know that's -- you know they say smoking cuts your [NOISE], um, weight.
R:  Right.  [SIGH] So, do I be, ah, fat and not smoke? [LAUGH]
L:  Smoke. [LAUGH] 
R:  Or start smoking?  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  I would- -- I wouldn't do that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But that's what they say that just like your, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh what?  Your emotions --
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I never thought about that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  That it'd be the same for her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with her smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, that'd be bad wouldn't it?
L:  Yes.  Terrible. [NOISE]
R:  Mm. [SIGH] But I know the other day somebody was talking to me -- the friend had gossiped about her and she was just so hurt.  And, you know, that could hurt your self esteem --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that wouldn't be a good habit, but --
L:  [NOISE] That's true.
R:  But I don't think it would really bother your health so much though. [SIGH] What else do they -- it was gossiping, smoking, drinking, overeating.  W- w- was exercising -- I tried to write them down but I couldn't write them all.
L:  Was exercising one of them?
R:  I thought that was the last one.  I didn't get it written down.  But it all goes hand in hand.  It's not healthy if you don't exercise.
L:  It really is. [NOISE]
R:  But I -- just like you in class I -- I stay at home and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- take care of my kids and clean house.  At least I'm doing something.
L:  Yes.
R:  I feel.  That's --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I -- I have to hike up hills, so 
R:  Oh, my goodness.  So you're getting your exercise?
L:  Yes.
R:  To go to class, do you mean?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  Where are -- what part of the state are you?
L:  [NOISE] I'm in Kentucky.
R:  Oh.  I'm in Indiana.  We're --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  -- not too far away.  Yeah.
L:  We're c- -- yeah.
R:  That's pretty close.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, are you from Kentucky or you just --
L:  I'm from Kentucky.
R:  And you go to school there to?
L:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  University of Kentucky?
L:  University of Kentucky.
R:  Oh!  Gosh.  
L:  [NOISE] Yep.
R:  My older son just turned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sixteen and we were just talking about colleges.  So that's --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- not gonna be too far down the road for him.
L:  No.  It won't be, will it?
R:  No, it won't, unfortunately.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] Well, I hope you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have good luck on doing these.  They're really pretty fun.  I'm -- I'm not a good talker.  I don't like to --
L:  Ah, so, are all of these -- do you have to talk on -- this is my very first one and I just thought it was a question -- answer question.
R:  [NOISE] No.  It's just like this but it's a different topic every day.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.  Um, ever- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They'll call you -- have you gotten a call yet?  Or did you call in?
L:  Okay.  You see I thought it was just, you know, like a survey -- like you would --
R:  No. [LAUGH] I -- I almost wish it was 'cause I'm not too good at conversation but -- 
L:  I'm not too good at conversation --
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  -- either so I'm glad that you -- I mean, because I didn't know when I -- 'cause, like, they've called a lot and I just haven't had time [NOISE] to --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- to get to them and, um [NOISE] --
R:  That's been me.
L:  -- when I, ah, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] when I finally [NOISE] too- -- took it they were like, you know, you -- your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you have a call partner.  And I was like, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Well, where's the call partner?"
R:  Now, did you -- did they call you?
L:  I'd got it online.  I do money and shopping -- mystery shopping.
R:  Do you?  So do I.
L:  Do you? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yeah, that is great.
L:  And, um -- [LIPSMACK] and it was just one of the, you know, jobs that they had offered and I was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, let me see what this is because I could have sworn the -- you know, the thing that said survey type, you know --
R:  Ooh.  Okay.
L:  Ten dollars for each survey, and I thought that was what it was but 
R:  Well, this is -- like I said this is my third one and I've --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- always had -- now they give you --
L:  Had to --
R:  -- different subject --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to talk about.  But yes, you have to come up with your own [LAUGH] thing.
L:  With -- ahah. [SIGH]
R:  But I -- I haven't been around either.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've missed a lot of calls --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, you can call in when you want?
L:  See I didn't know that you could call in either. [NOISE]
R:  Yep.
L:  So is it like -- it's there an eight hundred number? 
R:  Um, a- -- do you have a pin number?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, do I have a pin number?
R:  They gave me a pin number online.
L:  They probably gave me one [NOISE] I'll have to go back and look at it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  If you call in you need your pin number and if --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you want the eight hundred number I can give it to you?
L:  Sure.  Please.
R:  Ah, one eight six six --
L:  Wait a minute.  Hold on for a minute. [NOISE] [PAUSE] But, yeah, I think smoking would be the worst.  
R:  Mhm.  Definitely.
L:  One eight six six --
R:  Yeah.  Six eight seven four seven five eight.
L:  [inaudible] It's not writing. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I agree with you.  I think smoking is -- but you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I look at it -- even though I think smoking's the worst for you I would have to say that overeating is my struggle.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I just -- of course, if you don't smoke or drink it's not gonna -- you're not gonna think this is bad, but --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, I just, ah, -- that exercising and overeating.  Just wait until you get a little bit older.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's gonna get harder for you. [LAUGH]  But --
L:  Would you give me that number again please?
R:  Yeah.
L:  One eight six six --
R:  Eight -- eight six six six eight seven --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- four seven five eight.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I'm sure you could talk to somebody and they could give you your pin number or --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I've -- I probably have it and I always use, like, [NOISE] the same for everything.  I have, like, the same number so it's probably not gonna be hard for me to [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I didn't get to pick it.  They gave it to me.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  But, yeah, I do the same.  I keep the same --
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  -- number but I had to keep it in my email since I couldn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- remember it.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  Well, I'll have to look on there because I saw something from them. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  If they sent you, a -- it just said -- thanked me for enrolling in the telephone project and, um -- I think you can -- I've heard three calls and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- five -- I think you can do up to five calls.
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So fifty dollars that won't be bad --
L:  Fifty dollars.  That's not bad.
R:  No.  That'd be great.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, but I just -- I don't talk a lot.
R:  I don't either. [LAUGH]
L:  And I was thinking that it was, you know, the survey type --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- like you push yes or no or just --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- answer the question or -- or whatever.  I didn't know you had to, like, have the, [SIGH] you know, the conversation about --
R:  Well, if you get two quiet people I think it's gonna be real hard.  But, ah, you know, you've been able to keep it going.
L:  Wha- [LAUGH] --
R:  We've -- we've done pretty good, I think. [LAUGH] But then it seems, like, to take half an hour --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- those ten minutes.  But it seems like it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- thirty minutes.
L:  'Cause they said, "We'll let you know when your ten minutes is up".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I think they come on usually at eight and say to say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your goodbyes and 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that's that.  I really like your name, Chase.  That's --
L:  Thank you.
R:  For a girl I really -- I like different names like that.
L:  They, are -- thank you.
R:  I've heard of guys --
L:  Ah, name.  Mhm.
R:  -- called Chase.  Ahah.  But I like that.  Well, I hope you do well in your schooling.  What year are you in?
L:  Sophomore. 
R:  Oh, good.  So -- you done for the summer?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, good.  Aren't you glad?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, you'll be a sophomore ?
L:  I took -- no.  Well, I'll be a junior.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  I took, ah -- I just got to finish with, like, with the first half of summer. [NOISE]
R:  Okay. 
L:  And I'm gonna just lay off this second half just [NOISE] --
R:  Oh.  I don't blame you.  W- well good.  
L:  But --
R:  What -- what are you try- -- what are you studying?
L:  Nursing.
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  Yes.  I figure that I'll be able to keep a job.
R:  I think so.
L:  And that -- how many -- that's all that matters now.
R:  Oh, it is.
