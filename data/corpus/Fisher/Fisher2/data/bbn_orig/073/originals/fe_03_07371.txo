R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  This is, ah, Steve.
R:  Oh, hi.  My name is Bethany.
L:  Hi Bethany.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm doing okay.
R:  Good.
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny that I should be called right at the time that I'm taking my medicine, just before I go to bed.
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  I take a pile of medicine. [LAUGH] Ah, so obviously I'm not in very good health.
R:  Really?
L:  Really.  Yeah, but ah, I don't think I have SARS. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh that's good.
L:  They're talking about some seasonal disorder.
R:  Yeah, I think they're talking about when the, um, the weather changes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the temperature changes, if you're more susceptible to illness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like colds, I guess, is --
L:  Yeah, colds, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Well I think that's true.
L:  Well in general, yeah, it would be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do you -- have you gotten a cold this season?
L:  Um, I've got a cold right now, as a matter of fact. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Because, um, I think that it's really tricky knowing how -- how to dress when you go out in the morning.  I'm in the Southern California area --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and um, it -- it just varies by how near to the ocean that you are, ah, what the temperature's going to be, so I get up in the morning and -- and I'm not exactly sure if I'm going to go near the ocean or not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if I do, then it's colder and I'm likely to run into, ah, colder weather so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, I think that's what's happened this week.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you take over the counter things, or have you gone to the doctor?
L:  Well, I mainly have got some medicines, um, for my headache.  I take, um, I don't know, Naproxin, which is supposed to be for arthritis but I looked it up in my wife's handy dandy pharmaceutical guide --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and it said, you know, [LAUGH] everybody does this, right?  You go on the internet and, oh, some -- some guy usually gave some advice that I can take this for that [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] that's what people do. [LAUGH] It's so expensive to go to the doctor.
R:  I know.  Then they don't do anything for you anyway.
L:  Right, right, right.  They say, "Well, we'll run some tests and then we'll see what you have".  "But doctor, I don't feel good".  Well, [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.  Yeah, I -- I have pretty bad allergies so --
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  -- I get, um, sinus infections really easily --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but sometimes, like, I have to go to the doctor --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but then the antibiotics don't work because I'm so used to them.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  So I've just -- I went to, um, take my allergy medication every day --
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  -- and um, sometimes I just do, like, a steam thing, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like --
L:  Yeah.  Um, when -- when you have allergies, do you have pet allergies?
R:  Um, yeah, I do.  I -- I grew up with cats --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then when I was, like, fifteen, I became allergic to them --
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Oh.
R:  -- and -- yes, so I, actually I don't know if you've heard about it but, um, Siberian cats --
L:  Siberian pussy cats?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, Siberian cats, they're um, they're long haired but they don't have the protein in their saliva --
L:  Oh, you're kidding?
R:  Yeah, that makes cats, you know, you're allergic to them because of their dander because they've been licking themselves with their saliva that has the protein in it.
L:  Okay, that makes sense, yeah.
R:  So they have, like, one percent of that in their saliva.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So it -- it doesn't matter really.  Because I have one, he doesn't bother me at all but then I --
L:  You have a Siberian cat?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  But then when I go to other people's houses --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- it's like --
L:  -- their cat, sure --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- you know, domestic and what not, yeah.
R:  Yeah, but it's pretty neat if you know anyone that has allergies like that.
L:  Yeah, well, I'll keep that in mind.  I -- I've got a Golden Retriever and I love that little thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's given my wife some severe allergies, and I saw on television that they've got this thing that you can spray on your furniture and stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and says it -- it negates the affect of most of the, ah, allergens.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  That's what it says on the TV.  I don't know if it's true or not.
R:  What is it called?
L:  Oh, what is it?  It's, um, oh, it comes in little um, baby blue ah, ah, ah, canister.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, I don't know what the name of the thing is.
R:  That's okay.
L:  Yeah it's like a --
R:  I'll look it up.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's on the daytime TV things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What was the other thing we were supposed to talk about?  The common cold?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I didn't understand that question 'cause they said seven days for a cold, but then a week --
L:  Yeah, in other words, whether you go to the doctor or not it's the same thing.  The same difference.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well I agree with that.  I agree with that.  There's really nothing that's been found to -- to cure the common cold.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They can treat the symptoms --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, they can't get rid of it.
R:  So strange.
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  Do you think they ever will find one?
L:  I don't know.  It just -- it seems like it's such a wide range of viruses.
R:  Yeah.  They're constantly changing.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  So, it seems like there's a age long battle between good and evil, or whatever. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] So, how did you hear about this, ah, project thing?
L:  Oh, it's in the weekly, um, ah, alternative ah, lifestyle, um, news, ah, weekly.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and I answered the ad in there.  I couldn't get the hang of it at first.
R:  This is my first time actually.
L:  Oh, it is?  Oh my gosh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, well they wanted to take me off because every time that I answered I pressed for -- for hold --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then they'd hold indefinitely and hang up, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- eventually I learned you pressed one and they don't hold for you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so after I learned that it was no problem.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  How many times have you done it?
L:  Oh, once -- once I'd taken the hang of it, this is about -- about a week of it that I've been doing it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I didn't know what to think at first. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I got a call earlier but I had to go to work, so I --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, it's good that you got back and took this call here.  I have all my calls late at night because I don't know what my hours are going to be.  I just kind of float with the breeze. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I don't know what -- um, I'm trying to think of another question.  Ah, let's see, ah, do you ever take, like, ah, do you take, like Advil cold, or do you take --
L:  I like Ibuprofen.
R:  Yeah.  Just straight Ibuprofen.
L:  Sometimes I get the generic kind.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And sometimes I get the wh- -- what's the equivalent?  Advil?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Do you think there's any difference?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  No, I'm sure there is not.  Just the cost.
R:  You were saying that something about the Naproxin sodium, or -- something --
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's equivalent to, um --
R:  Alive?  Is it like Alive?
L:  No --
R:  Okay.
L:  No, it's just, ah, let me -- let me read the label on here.  Naproxin five hundred milligrams, and ah, the size of the thing is about to choke a horse.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It says, "Take with food or milk", well I couldn't, we're out of milk so I'm going to have some pumpkin pie when I get off the phone --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I guess that'll -- that'll -- do it, because it will give me a heartburn if I -- if I take it straight, or with water.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I take it with water it will give me a heartburn, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, yeah.  Ah, what do you take for a cold?
R:  Um, well I -- I've tried all of them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, um, I guess if it's, like, a really bad cold and I have to do something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even though I hate the feeling of it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Dayquil sometimes works.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Or else, like, if you really have to do something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't really, like, I take, ah, Advil, usually too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and for like a headache, but if I can stay home I just usually try to drink a lot of fluids and stuff.
L:  Yes, yes, yes.  Orange juice, the old standby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I took a Nyquil one time when I had a graveyard shift job --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just before I went to work, and the first part of my work I was standing up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I was moving around also.  And I seemed to be really, really, really, really sleepy, but, I mean, you get that way when you're on the graveyard shift --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I didn't think anything of it, and then, ah, when I had to stay still, like, I was -- I was stationed in one particular place, I all but fell asleep.
R:  Oh my --
L:  So I reported to the nurse and I said, "Hey, ah", she said, "First of all, have you been drinking?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because that -- that -- that Nyquil does have some alcohol in it.
R:  Yeah, it does.
L:  And I'm sure she could smell some alcohol.  I said, "No, but I took some medicine", she said, "Uh har!  What medicine?"  And I said, "Nyquil".  "You fool!  That's got not only alcohol in it, but it puts you to sleep.  Why would you take that before you came on the job?"  I said, "Well, I wasn't feel well and I wanted to -- to feel better". [LAUGH] "Next time read the damn label". [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] She sent me back to work.
R:  Did you have to go home, or did you ?
L:  No, no, no, they -- they gave me a choice, you know, if I wanted to go home.  I said. "No, I have a, you know, I have a, um, car pool and I'll -- I'll stay here and -- this was in
