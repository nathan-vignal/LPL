L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  I'm Jeanette.
R:  Hi, this is Candy.
L:  Hi.  Oh --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- I like that name. [LAUGH]
R:  Thanks. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  [SIGH] Um, we're supposed to talk about illness?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Okay, and --
L:  If either one of us get ill and --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  We're not talking -- we're [NOISE] just talking about [NOISE].  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Seasonal illnesses maybe or ?  I mean --
L:  Um.
R:  -- they're not talking about cancer and things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right?
L:  No, ah --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, like seasonal stuff, you know, colds and flu and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- things like that 
R:  All right.  Well, [NOISE] I don't --
L:  During the seasons. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, I don't really [NOISE] get too sick. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm pretty lucky.  How about yourself?
L:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I normally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get a cold in the winter time --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- but, um, I've got so many health problems I can't really go get a shot, you know, so  [LAUGH]
R:  Ahah.
L:  Um  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But, to keep myself from getting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sick I take a lot of vitamins. 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Vitamin C., vitamin E. --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, Golden Seal --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- echinacea.
R:  I'm kinda on a bad phone here. [NOISE]
L:  I thought it was my phone. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I've got to find the other phone and of course nobody can find it for me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I'll walk around and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- look for it, um   [SIGH] Yeah, I was real fortunate this year I didn't get too ill.  [SIGH] I have the kids -- when they come home from school, I make sure they wash their hands --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was diagnosed with breast cancer --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- this October so [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  -- I couldn't [NOISE] really allow myself to get sick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So   But, it was kind of, you know -- I don't know if it's true or not but I -- well, I had the kids wash their hands everyday when they came home from school and I didn't get sick at all.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I was very fortunate.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I do get sick.  Usually it's like a sinus thing in the -- seasonal type allergies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I just take a Benadryl or Sudafed, [NOISE] or s- -- or suffer [LAUGH] so 
L:  Are they, um, like she said -- the, um, teleprompter -- I think she said that it -- there's a saying that, "A cold will last seven days without a doctor's care".
R:  Ahah.
L:  And if we find that true or false.
R:  Um, [SIGH] well, I don't know.  For some people I suppose it's true, but for some people it may not be true because it may not be a cold.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it might be something [NOISE] more than a cold, say pneumonia or something like that, that, you know, started as a cold.
L:  Well, I always find I have to go to the doctor because I need a ah, antibiotic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- most of the time.
R:  Because it's gone into something else.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  You know.
L:  And, sometimes -- the last cold I had I think it lasted me three weeks.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  I would have to say that little [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that little, um, saying --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is false --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- for me.
R:  -- that's what I would say too.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um, I don't know how it's -- how you can really diagnose it as just being a cold, you know, [MN] we're not -- paed- -- you know, we're not physicians ourselves.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, if we get over it, usually -- I mean, if it were to last seven days that seems --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like a long time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for me to not go anywhere --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but 
L:  Yeah, me to because I like to get out [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I don't want to stay cooped up. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, tell me about it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was cooped up all winter because I'm in New York --
L:  Ooh!
R:  -- and, ah, I was cooped up all winter long.  It was so long and we still haven't had any days --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think we've had one or two days --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where I've said, "Boy, it's kind of warm today" because it --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I heard about that bad weather in New York.  I don't know what's going on in -- [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Even right now it's raining.  I just tri- -- I haven't even planted my vegetable garden and I said to my husband, you know, "Should I even bother to plant it?" and, ah, he's like, "Yeah".  So, I just -- that's where I was a few minutes ago just trying to get them in but then it started --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to rain.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, I don't know.  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  It's hard to stay on topic for ten minutes without straying too far.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So   Have you done many of these before?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I think --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- this is the sixth one.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [SIGH] Yes, the sixth one.  The first -- the first one I did was, um, about the economy and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then others were [SIGH] about things I know about. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?  I did one on family. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I think it was a couple of weeks ago I talked to a gentleman from, like, Mississippi or something so   Hard to stay on topic. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, let's see I can't remember what the other questions were from the teleprompter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you?
L:  Um   Which seasons do we mostly get sick in?  You know, we have -- we sort of went through that. 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Within ten minutes, huh? [MN] [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Except for like the seasonal things when the, ah, goldenrod --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- goes into pollen, you know --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the summer for me.
L:  Well, I have allergies too so 
R:  Do ya?  Do -- are you on medicine for the allergies? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Are y- [NOISE] --
L:  I'm taking Zyrtec.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I just -- I don't have them that bad, I'm pretty fortunate, you know.
L:  My whole family gets sick.  I mean -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My sister in law's on, like, Claritin.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like --
L:  I was on that.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I was on that one time and --
R:  Yeah?
L:  It didn't work for me. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But [SIGH] --
R:  My daughter, she's eleven -- she uses that Flonase stuff 'cause she gets stuffy.
L:  Yeah.  I've been on that before.
R:  She- --
L:  It's works.
R:  Yeah.  Well sh- -- well, she's not consistent, she won't do it all the time.  You know, it's just when she gets a stuffy nose she's sit there and complain that she has a stuffy nose.  It's like, "Well, you should have taken that stuff". 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- but  [LIPSMACK]
L:  It's not the best thing in the world to make you feel better [LAUGH] but --
R:  No.  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  [SIGH] I mean, I hate squirting stuff up my nose, but --
R:  'Cause you -- you end up tasting it.
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Tell me about it.
R:  Yeah.  Gees.  H- --
L:  But, um --
R:  How did you find out about the research things?
L:  Um, a friend of mine in Massachusetts told me about it.
R:  Oh, okay.  I found out online about it. 
L:  Yeah.  So th- [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, kind of interesting.
L:  Ah  [SIGH]
R:  What have they, like, taped everything we say?
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's recorded, um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know it's recorded --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so  [SIGH]
R:  I mean -- what's this? [SIGH] I wish I had more illnesses to talk about, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm lucky.  I'm very lucky.
L:  [SIGH] Well, um --
R:  Well, [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH] I usually end up with a sprained ankle.  I don't know if that's an illness or not, but  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's kind of.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Maybe it -- maybe it was from the cold. [LAUGH]
L:  And, I have neuropathy. 
R:  Oh -- what is -- is that where you can't feel your feet and hands?
L:  [SIGH] Well, yeah, it gets that way.  It goes along with diabetes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which I have.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] it's [SIGH]-- sometimes you get [SIGH] this throbbing in one leg and for- -- in the other leg if it's okay, you know --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- then sometimes I have to use the scooter when I got into a grocery store or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- something.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, sometime my legs get out -- give out on me. [SIGH]
R:  Okay, yeah.  I've got, ah -- sometimes -- like [MN] with the -- when I had, um, the mastectomy they said, "A- -- from the chemo, you can get the neuropathy sometimes" but I didn't get too much.  I have a bit of a carpel tunnel, but --
L:  Mhm. [SIGH]
R:  -- um, it's, you know, more [NOISE] agitated --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- when I garden or something like that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- so 
L:  Well, I've got Crohn's Disease myself.
R:  Oh, yeah?  One of my friends has that.
L:  And, [SIGH] let's see, what else?  Two --
R:  So --
L:  -- ruptured discs --
R:  Yeah? [SIGH]
L:  -- in my back. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's got to be painful.
L:  Oh, [SIGH] man. [SIGH]
R:  I can't even imagine that.  I know that when -- after I had the surgery I had a hard time, like, flipping over and things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It hurt and I couldn't imagine, you know, the middle of your spine always hu- hurting like that.  So -- but  hm. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  That's me.
R:  Always something.
L:  Illnesses, man, I -- I -- hm. [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] You know, it's funny because you can get sit there and say, you know, I've got this, this and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but sometimes it's -- there's people that are much worse off.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  You know, they almost get, um, [LIPSMACK] kinda used to it, you know.  I mean, like when I went from the chemo to the radiation I was, "Oh, I've got to go do radiation now" and before it would -- you know -- 'cause I've just had time to adjust to it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  And, when they did the chemo they told me that my sugar was high.   It was two hundred and sixty or something and they said, "That's high".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- said it was from the medicine that I took so as soon as I stopped taking the medicine it went -- went away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they said, "Sometimes diabetes runs in the family".  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I didn't have any of that in my family, so --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- different things.
L:  [SIGH] I've got an aunt, um -- she just had a mastectomy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, they had to change her medication.  They've had to change it twice because she gets hurting in -- a lot in her shoulders.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they're not sure if it's because, um, she might have more cancer or what but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, they keep going -- keep doing tests on her.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I've had the same thing and I said to my doctor the other day, I said you know, "I'm just worried that it's gone there or something, you know into my bones".  And he said that, you know, "You'll ha- -- you'll be afra- afraid like that for years" and he's -- because I have shoulder pain too --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and what I think it's from, and maybe it's the same with your aunt, is I carry myself differently, I'm more hunched over --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause all the muscles they were all cut, and -- under the underarms and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think I carry myself differently and that kind of causes the shoulder pain for me.  'Cause the doctor told me that with the cat scans that I've had, and the bone scans I've had that something would have shown up if it was, you know, say cancer or something like that.  So, it's just got to be the way I carry myself now.  So 
L:  [NOISE]
