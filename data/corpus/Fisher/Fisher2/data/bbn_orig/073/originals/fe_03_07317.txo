R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  This is Slenda[?], to who am I speaking?
L:  Hi, um, my name is Fania[?], who's that?
R:  My name is Slenda, and I understand our topic of conversation today is food.
L:  Yes.
R:  And would you prefer eating in a restaurant or do you prefer eating at home?
L:  Ah, actually I prefer to eat at restaurant, but ac- actually, in rea-, in reality I eat most at home --
R:  Well I certainly --
L:  How about you?
R:  Unfortunately, I eat out more often than I eat at home, so eating at home is a real treat for me.
L:  Ah, okay [LAUGH].
R:  I work and I'm on the road during -- [inaudible] during the week and so I tend to eat out a lot and to me it all tastes the same and so I can't hardly wait to get home and have what I call some real food.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's understandable.  Um, my situation is 'cause -- me and my husband we both are good cooks, so we really enjoying cook at home and eat together, and sometimes we -- we -- we sometimes eat lunch outside but mostly just at home -- I eat everything at home.
R:  Well, that would be my preference, but unfortunately since I'm on the road so much and I'm not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I'm not saying I'm a good cook, 'cause I'm pro- -- I'm not a good cook, but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I do enjoy it, and -- and I -- and -- yeah, I -- I really like to cook, I just don't have the time to do it as much as I would like to but I certainly enjoy it.  Now, what -- what's your idea of a perfect meal?
L:  Well, um, because we, um, my family are all Chinese, so we cook mostly Chinese style, Asian style cook.
R:  Er -- what part of the country are you from?
L:  What?
R:  Where do you live -- what part of the country -- what State?
L:  Ah, we live in north part, we live in Minnesota.
R:  In Minnesota?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well I'm down -- I'm down in Oklahoma and my idea of a perfect meal is red beans, fried potatoes, cornbread, onions and sliced tomatoes.
L:  Uh-huh, that's more Western type --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- ah we love -- we love things like ah, spring roll, dumpling and ah, um -- and, and we eat a lot rice.
R:  Well, the only Chinese food I've ever had is the kind that you eat in restaurants, so, I really don't know what really -- what home cooked Chinese food would taste like, but I bet it would be good.
L:  Yeah, um, it -- but, but -- it usually takes longer to prepare, um, I mean more complicated to prepare and to eat -- to cook actually --
R:  W- --
L:  -- that you need some trick and some skills.
R:  Well, it's not very difficult or very com- complicated to, to throw a can of beans on -- on the stove and cook --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it's not very, and it's not very complicated to -- to slice some potatoes and fry them, and I think that's probabl- --
L:  Yeah, it, yeah, yeah, I also think that's a little bit easy [LAUGH].
R:  It's quite a bit easier, I feel very sure -- the only -- now, I've made egg rolls before --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, and to me, that's a lot of trouble.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's a lot -- that, that takes a -- a lot of preparation time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I mess up -- and I mess up everything in the kitchen.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
R:  So, does your husband help you with the cooking?
L:  Um, usually -- usually I do most of the stuff and ah, he helps sometimes, but sometimes I just let him in charge of this -- like in the weekend when he has more time and ah, he w-, he actually is a better cook than me.
R:  Oh, you're kidding -- you're so lucky.
L:  I'm not, I'm serious, I'm serious [LAUGH].
R:  You are so lucky to have someone [LAUGH]. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm really lucky [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] Well, I am a single person so I, you know --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I have to do my own -- if I want it I have to fix it s- -- and -- I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sometimes it's just more trou-, it seems to me like it's more trouble than it's worth.
L:  Oh, yeah, you know what --
R:  -- to go to -- to go to the trouble.
L:  You know what -- before marriage I -- although I can cook by myself, I eat mostly outside --
R:  Yes, it --
L:  -- because e-, I -- it just that you feel, so tired you cook everything at -- you just eat by yourself.
R:  And besides that, it's hard to cook for just one person and make --
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  -- it is, and -- and -- and -- and season it where it tastes right [MN] -- and, and, and I -- I raised a family, so I -- you know I -- I'm used to cooking big meals and I've nev- --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- even though my children are grown and gone I still haven't learned how to cook just a little bit --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's -- I fix a whole pan of this, and a whole pan of that, you know -- and then it ends up --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I understand.
R:  -- it ends up getting thrown out, because I won't eat it all --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, you know but I cook most Asian style, but, um, like those Western style, like, I -- I can only cook very simple Western style, like hamburger, or, I mean that's the most -- most simplest one I don't know how to cook more complicated Western food.
R:  Well, it's not that complicated, I think -- I think we all tend to cook what our mothers cooked.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Don't you?  Yeah, I -- I cook the way my mother cooked --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because that's how I learned to cook.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the same way.  Yeah, I also just somewhat follow my, my Mom's style.
R:  Yeah.  And, and it's not that I wouldn't like to cook another way it's just that that's how I learned and I think a lot of times we get used to eating certain foods and, and we just don't think to change and to try --
L:  That's right --
R:  -- something different
L:  -- that's right -- you just get -- get used to that, and you think you like that and hard to accept other type of food sometimes.
R:  I think, I think you're right.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we just get in the habit of eating certain things and -- and -- and we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we get kind of set in our ways, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm, I'm pretty good at getting set in my ways [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, do you, do you have to cook for children, or is it just you and your husband that you cook for?
L:  No, no, we don't have any chi-, kids now, so it, it's a little bit simpler to cook just for two people, but --
R:  You did?
L:  -- my hus-, yeah and my husband has very good appetite, so I think it seems ver- very easy to satisfy him [LAUGH]
R:  Now, is he a picky eater or will he eat [inaudible].
L:  No, no, he, he's not -- he's not.
R:  Well, I've -- I've always said that my kids will eat anything that don't bite them first.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They -- they -- they are good eaters now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they will eat anything you put on the table --
L:  Oh [MN]
R:  -- which makes my job a lot easier --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when they're home and I'm cooking for 'em.
L:  Do you like spicy food?
R:  Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I do like spicy food [inaudible]. 
L:  Yeah, I think it -- it will make your appetite better when you eat some, or usually use spicy food as somewhat um, appetizer before the dinner or something like that.
R:  And, and I know that we're not supposed to eat as much salt as I eat --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- but I like a lot of seasoning on my food.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
R:  And I probably use too much, but that's okay [LAUGH], that's all right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It'll just be -- it'll just be me that I end up poisoning --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- with all of that stuff -- I guess.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, what kinds of restaurant you usually go to?
R:  When I eat out I usually eat at whatever's closest to the motel I'm staying in --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- but if I had my choice, if I got to pick where I wanted to go to eat I would gonna -- want to go somewhere where they had real napkins --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- cloth napkins and real glasses, 'cause I hate to use paper napkins and I don't like drinking out of plastic.
L:  Oh, okay, I see, I see.
R:  And other than that --
L:  Oh -- I -- 
R:  -- I'm not too picky.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, do you -- do you say you are kind of picky about, ah, like, are you on diet -- you, you picky about food, ah, or this -- this stuff -- I mean --
R:  I'm -- I'm really -- I'm really not too picky about what they put in front of me, I'm more picky about how they present it and, and whether or not the, the restaurant is -- I like to have a linen table cloth --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I like linen napkins and I like good service --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I'm -- and I'm -- I think I'm more picky about that than I am about --
L:  More picky about service than food itself?
R:  -- yeah.  It actually -- I think I am --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's probably kind of stupid, but -- but -- it makes a big difference to me how that food is presented.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, sometimes it's an art --
R:  Yes it is.
L:  -- how you present it, yeah.
R:  And, and, and the -- the way it's presented can make the food appear appeti- a lot more appetizing than it really is.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.  You know, I also watch the food channel on TV --
R:  I don't -- I don't get the food channel.
L:  Oh, I see, I see.
R:  I wish I did, but I don't.
L:  Oh, you don't have cable at home?  
R:  I have cable, but we -- the cable progr- -- the cable service that I have doesn't give us the food channel.
L:  Oh okay, okay, I see --
R:  But I do --
L:  -- 'cause all the time -- all the time ...
