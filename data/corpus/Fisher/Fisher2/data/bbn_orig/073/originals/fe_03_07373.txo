L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name's Christina.
R:  Hi, Christina.  This is Carol.  How are you?
L:  Oh, I'm doing fine.  How're you doing?
R:  [SIGH] Okay.  Another dreary day here. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, where are you?
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  Ooh.  I'm in Boston. [LAUGH]
R:  So, how's your weather?
L:  Oh, it's pretty dreary up here too.
R:  Yeah.  Here too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Let's hear it for New England and, ah -- well, I don't know, Pennsylvania isn't part of New England is it?
R:  It -- it's close. 
L:  It's close.
R:  I -- I think our weather comes -- swings up there.
L:  Ha.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Wouldn't surprise me at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  I think our topic was which was worse.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  An- an- and I didn't get everything that she was saying.  I got the gossiping --
L:  Right.
R:  -- overeating --
L:  An- --
R:  -- not exercising --
L:  And then smoking or drinking excessively, or drinking caffeine. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's [LAUGH] pretty broad. [LAUGH]
L:  It really is.  Um, so I guess I'll go with gossiping. [LAUGH]
R:  You know I think would too.  Um, an- -- but drinking and smok- -- drinking excessively I would say [NOISE] is, [MN] ve- very close behind.
L:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  
R:  [NOISE] Y- yeah.
L:  I can see drinking excessively.  I mean, the one or two drinks every once and a while isn't that big a deal.  But, um -- I don't know.  I -- I've -- I guess I -- I've always felt that the more damaging thing would be talking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about other people, you know, in -- in --
R:  Ye --
L:  -- the derogatory fashion.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  An- and -- and the -- the rumors being spread and, [SIGH] the -- the feelings being hurt an- --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, um, -- I don't know, I've just seen so much damage done -- I mean, it was more kind of in the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the high school element is where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you really see that happening, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, you see it everywhere but in high school it seems to be so much more vicious. [SIGH]
R:  Yes. 
L:  Which I don't know if that's just because people are younger and their hormones are all over the place or, you know.
R:  A- a- -- but -- but hav- -- I have two daughters, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ten and twelve so I'm seeing that it's getting [SIGH] worse even at the elementary level.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  Um, the cliques are starting earlier an- an- and the talking about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- others [NOISE] an- and maybe it's because they have siblings that are in the junior senior high a- -- as you were saying an- an --
L:  That they're being influenced earlier.
R:  Yes.
L:  But the other sad thing is kids are growing up so much faster these days.  
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  And [LAUGH] I think there's so much that is happening to them so soon, you know.  They're not really getting the chance to be children anymore.  About the time that they hit, liked, ten, eleven they're expected to be an adult, at least in their peer circles and, [SIGH] it's just so wrong.
R:  It -- it is.  We -- we actually pulled our kids out of public school last year.  Um, [LIPSMACK] to help them with their education but to be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kids longer and not be exposed to the gossiping, the put downs and, um, [LIPSMACK] a -- a lot of the social influences that I just didn't see were good for them.
L:  Right.  It's so damaging at that age too, because I mean, a- -- I mean middle school and even through high school -- because, I mean, there's so many insecurities.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, I think that, you know, some kids just pray on that.  They absolutely just jump on it.  And they make it a lot worse by -- by spreading lies and spreading rumors or even just kind of half truths.  You know?
R:  Yes.  Um, wh- what I see is, um, [MN] a -- a lot of two income families, um, [SIGH] so the kids are neglected at home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so to get some attention they will target [MN], um, [LIPSMACK] a child that's not as strong an- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so that they can feel a little bit of power. [NOISE] Does --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that make sense? [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  It totally does.  It's -- it's almost like they're trying to justify themselves by making someone else feel even worse.
R:  Yeah.  They're -- they're not getting the attention they need.  But let's pick on l- little Joey over here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- an -- and maybe I can feel better if I make him feel smaller.
L:  It's terrible.  It's absolutely terrible.  I mean, I remember when -- when I was in high school -- I have horrible, horrible food allergies, right?  I mean, there're certain foods that, I mean, if I eat them I get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- violently ill.  I break out in hives, um, I've had times where I've, you know, starting vomiting -- you know, just really bad things.  And, there was one day I was getting the cafeteria lunch and I didn't realize that they were using, like, a -- a peanut base in the spaghetti.
R:  Yes. 
L:  And I got violently ill.  And I went into the bathroom and I was throwing up and for weeks, this one girl -- she was in there at the time -- she told everybody I was bulimic.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And it spread throughout the entire school, like, almost, like, wild fire.  And, I was constantly getting these comments about, you know, "Oh, well you're just doing this to control your weight, you don't really have health problems".  And it was so infuriating and there was nothing I could really do -- I mean, what was I going to do?  Bring in my medical records --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and show them? [LAUGH]
R:  An- and it takes so long to overcome that bad image that was portrayed on you, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anybody [MN] -- it just takes so long and so many other things have to change before people forget about that.
L:  Oh, exactly.  And it's amazing that you can't even say anything for yourself really, you know.  You can defend yourself and they just say that, you know, "Your -- well, your just defending yourself so you're just trying to justify your own actions" because they've already bought into the whole rumor mill.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ooh.  It's just -- I -- I feel so bad for kids now. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] N- now, do you have kids?
L:  No.  I -- I don't.  I don't.  I have two younger sisters but they're kind of getting on.  Ah, one of them's still in high school and the other one just started college.
R:  Okay.  It -- it -- it's -- it's a challenge.  My husband and I have taught, um, the junior senior high in Sunday school and --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- the first Sunday that we had these kids, my husband and I left an -- and we said, "Who's gonna learn more in this class?" an- and it was -- both --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of us said we were gonna learn more, an- and we both said we would not want to change --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- places with these teens today.
L:  Oh, no!
R:  With -- with everything that they have to g- -- you know, live through --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  -- and -- and go through.  It -- it -- it's shocking.
L:  It really is.  I -- I just -- I can't even believe it.  I mean -- I mean, I was seeing some of the stuff as I was getting older.  But, you know, I tried to stay a kid as long as I possibly could, you know.  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just -- I feel so bad for them.
R:  An- an- and they've got all of these -- the g- -- the gossiping, the --
L:  Mhm. [SIGH]
R:  -- overeating, the, um, models who are perfect twos. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  That does nothing for them.
R:  No.  They have no good role models for them out there.
L:  Not at all.
R:  So, you know, they've -- they've gotta do [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try to survive. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Amidst all of it, you know.  I mean, there's -- there's just so much pressure and it comes from their peers, it comes from media.  It -- it comes from everywhere.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know.
R:  Their -- their music, their -- their video --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- games.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It -- it -- it's hitting them from every direction.
L:  Oh. [SIGH] Mm. [SIGH]
R:  It's a tough world. [LAUGH]
L:  It really is.  It's -- it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I -- I don't really know how it got this way.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, when you look at the generations -- I mean, I know with my parents -- I mean, they kind of -- they -- they grow up in the fifties and, you know, that was kind of like a very ideal time, you know.  Well, almost ideal.  But I -- o- -- some of the problems still existed but I don't think that they were as -- as forceful as they are today.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think with, um, [LIPSMACK] two income families --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and mom and dad not there the children are left to raise themselves.  Um, an- and they're not capable of doing that so that, you know, they're filling in what they can and -- and what they see other's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, I -- I just think the values and the morals of society --
L:  It's all going down hill.
R:  Ye- Yeah.  Ther- there aren't any.  There aren't any.  Um 
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  I -- I think we'd have to go back more towards how people used to live --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and -- and do with less.
L:  Right.  [LIPSMACK] I agree.  I mean, that was the way that -- that my parents raised my sisters and myself, you know.  They were -- they were very big on [SIGH] [MN] -- they -- I -- they wanted to keep us as young as possible too, you know.  Keep us out of all of these pressures and [SIGH] they did their best.  But, I mean, there are things that seep in that even the parents can't control especially if they're not home.  You know?
R:  [MN] Yes.
L:  And that's really not through their fault. [LAUGH]  I mean, nowadays you really do need a double income household to survive.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, we're doing it on one. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  And we -- and we are surviving, um --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I'm a --
R:  Like -- like -- like I said we've pulled the girls out to try to protect them some and try to let them enjoy their childhood as much as they can.  But all of these things still come up in front of them that they have to face and -- and, [SIGH] we have to teach them, um, how to say no to drugs and --
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and smoking an- and how to say no to the alcohol at parties.  
L:  Right.  Ex- --
R:  Um 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  I mean, my mom -- my mom, ah, quit work, um, after my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sisters were born and she stayed home full time and I'm -- in retrospect I'm am so grateful because it re- --
