L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Cathy.
R:  Hi, my name is Kirsten.
L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi.
L:  I guess the subject of the day is my favorite subject in the whole wide world, I think.
R:  [LAUGH] I believe it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I believe it.  Um --
L:  Oh gee, how hard is it to decide, do you like +eating at a restaurant or do you like eating at home -- hmm --
R:  Eating out.
L:  Oh definitely --
R:  Every time.
L:  -- definitely hands down [LAUGH].
R:  What kind of food is -- what -- what -- what genre of food would you prefer?
L:  Hm.  [SIGH] I -- I -- I guess I go through phases --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I suppose overall I'm probably a steak and potatoes kind of girl, but my most recent craving is something called Korean barbeque, have you ever had --
R:  -- I've never heard of such a thing.
L:  -- oh god, it's so good --
R:  Is that the one they have to bury in the ground and ferment?
L:  No, no, no, no, no -- it's um [MN] --
R:  Oh no, that's kim chi.
L:  That's kim chi, that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've never had that, but it smells nasty [LAUGH].
R:  I e- -- it's too bitter for me, I don't like how bitter it is.
L:  Um, ah, no, this is -- you eat on a table with like a grill in the middle and there's like oh -- you -- you -- you get a meat and then there's a whole bunch of like twenty different things that you can use for toppings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's marinated vegetables and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fish, and all kinds of stuff that you can use as topping and you wrap it up in a lettuce leaf --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah like a romain lettuce leaf -- it is so good, oh my god, 'cause it's --
R:  I've never, I've never heard of such a thing.
L:  -- oh, it's outstanding.  Um, so what's your favorite?
R:  Ah, my favorite food --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, it would have to change on a day to day basis, but pretty much anything with sugar --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I love very -- I have -- I have a major sweet tooth, I have a friend whom I eat out with often --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she ah, always laughs at my ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- forever ordering of dessert.  Because --
L:  Oh no, that has to be esp- especially if I eat out, see I'm a mom of two small kids and when I get out you can bet I'm going to enjoy it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so desserts -- big dessert, oh yeah.
R:  I love dessert --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I love sweets, I love anything sweet, but I don't eat meat.
L:  You don't?
R:  No.
L:  See I have a --
R:  I am a, I'm a less pure vegetarian than I used to be, I now eat um, a lot of seafood, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I moved from the North East of the United States to Florida, so it's ah, fresh and it's  abundant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's cheap here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so when I lived in the North East I never, I -- I was a very staunch vegetarian -- the only time I'd order seafood --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is if I was out eating and there was just nothing else on the menu, but, um --
L:  Oh, see now I would imagine in the North East -- the only place I've ever had seafood that I really liked it was Boston [LAUGH].
R:  Well it depends where -- I was in -- I wasn't on the coast --
L:  Oh, okay, yeah well then you have the same problem I do with -- 'cause I'm pretty much mainland now [MN].
R:  [MN] But, ah -- I eat a lot of vegetables --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I love vegetables, my husband would tell you my -- my favorite vegetable lately is green beans, I eat frozen green beans --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- probably three days a week, I eat 'em for a snack -- I eat a lot of zucchinis, ah mushrooms, I do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just eat lots of vegetables, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- not a big fruit eater, but big vegetable eater --
L:  Big vegetables -- see now I'm not real big on fruit either --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I prefer to get my sugar from non natural sources [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, me too, you know, chocolate, sugar --
L:  Right.
R:  -- cheesecake --
L:  Oh yeah [MN].
R:  -- but um, I bet we eat out, we don't have any kids, I bet we eat out, mm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably on average twice a week.
L:  Prior to kids, so did we [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- but not any more, you just don't, I mean I understand there are people who don't want to hear kids in a restaurant.  I just don't want to take mine to a restaurant because --
R:  'Cause you don't want to have to deal with them --
L:  -- no one gets to eat [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no one gets to eat -- they don't eat, we don't eat -- it's just, it's horrible.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, no, it's just the two of us, but we ah, we do a lot of eating out --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and we both enjoy it and it's easy you know, I love to cook, I love to cook --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but sometimes I'm just -- it's just hot, I'm tired, I haven't been shopping, it's just easier to go out --
L:  [NOISE]  See, I love to cook, but my favorite part about eating out at a restaurant is nobody has to clean [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  They can use as many pots as they want and somebody else --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- is dealing with it [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, I -- we do -- we share the cleaning du- -- but then again when you're only cooking for two, it doesn't make nearly as much of a mess.
L:  Yes, yes, exactly.
R:  So, it's not like to b- -- get out the big pots --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and do all that stuff -- my husband is very, very, very low key with food as long as he doesn't have to cook it he's happy, and he's not a vegetarian so, anything I put on the table it's fine with him.
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's very nice.
R:  Yep, and when I ah decided to stop eating meat it was ah right before we were married and I said, "Listen, here's the deal, I know this is not a choice you wanna make, but it's one that I'm gonna make and by default it's going to be what's in your house" and ah actually it's a kinda interesting story because ah, I said at that time, "Here's the deal -- I'm not going to have it in the house, I'm not going to prepare it regularly, but if you want it, tell me in the morning, I will make a trip to the store, and I will make sure that it happens for you", and actually it was just two weeks ago he was flipping through Cooking Life helping me plan, ah, meals --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he says, "I want this", and it's actually -- I haven't made it yet -- I -- but, um, it's ah, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a chili recipe that has a Spanish sausage in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's, it's meat, and ah, he said, "Listen ...", he was, he was really nice about it, he's like "Wow, this looks really good, it's like I don't know what kind of spices we could substitute", and suddenly I just looked at him and said, "Do you want me to just buy the damn sausage and make the thing" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he says, "Yes, I really, really want it" --
L:  Yes, yes, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  I said, "Okay, fine".  So, for the first time I actually had to buy it for him, um, I have -- I have bought it for him when I was going to be out of town, a lot of times if I'm going to be out for a couple of days he wants me to buy him a chicken and he'll roast a chicken --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and eat that for a couple of days, but this is the first time I've had to buy it and I'm going to cook it, so I haven't gotten around to doing it -- we've been eating a lot more eating out lately, but, um, yeah, I'm going to be cooking meat sometime in the next week --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- which is something I haven't done in nine years.
L:  So, if you eat out do you have problems being a vegetarian?
R:  Not at all.
L:  Really?  That's really nice to hear.
R:  Um, it's, it's a lot easier especially down here 'cause I eat fish -- if I didn't eat fish down here it would be a nightmare.  I live in the west -- on the west coast of Florida --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I don't know if you've ever been here, but it is --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a very, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- red neck [inaudible] of Florida
L:  So, I'm thinking, "Oh yes", see now I'm originally from Chicago and I'm currently living n- near Indianapolis and I would not have anticipated the [LAUGH] red set[?] way of thinking, but wow, I'm just surrounded by it [LAUGH].
R:  I some- -- I mean I'm not -- I mean I'm from you know, I grew up an hour and a half south of Buffalo in a very small -- small town and we lived in [inaudible], we lived in Syracuse, so I mean we never, I mean I was never in a big huge -- well, I lived in Buffalo for a while, but, um, in -- in -- in -- where we are now is, you know [inaudible] a large city, but, it's very red neck Florida and it's -- and it's -- there are people that my husband works with that every time they see me, they want to corner me and just explore more about this not eating meat thing, because they just can't understand how this could --
L:  Can't fathom it [LAUGH] --
R:  -- possibly be.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "What do you eat?", they ask me, "What do you eat?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then when I say, "What do you eat, if you don't eat meat?",  [several inaudible words], "If we -- if you don't know what I eat if I don't eat meat, what do you eat?".
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I don't know, it's, it's --
L:  See now, I don't find that -- my son, who is three, is pretty much vegetarian by choice.  The only meat that I can get him to eat -- I don't even actually count it as meat -- is hotdogs [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] No -- that's funny.
L:  But, he -- he loves vegetables.  I mean, I could have worse problems --
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  -- so we eat, we eat a lot more vegetables, we really do, um --
R:  They're good for ya.
L:  Oh yeah, but I have a friend who, actually I have several friends who are vegetarians, um, and I have found, I -- I think, again my favorite channel in the whole world is the food channel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I get some of my best ideas for, for things for when they come over, ah, ah, off there, and --
R:  I'm a big ah fan of cooking like I ah, even, even --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  -- yes, they actually have a whole section called the Square Vegetarian, actually this month right, they have a section called, um, ah, Dinner Tonight, where they have three or four recipes -- it's actually the recipe, the side dish, everything, the whole thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, it's, it's -- and all the recipes and how to make it and they're all real simple, and um, actually this month I went -- I flicked through and they're all vegetarian, every single one of them, but, I'm, I'm [inaudible] --
L:  You know they're doing a lot more, see I -- I -- when I sit down to nurse my baby --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I watch the food channel and that's actually [LAUGH] when I get a chance to watch it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the -- they're doing a lot more with vegetarian recipes -- a lot more, and, which is really cool because I made these grilled portobello mushrooms the other day --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for my husband and I who, I mean, we're not vegetarians, but I said, "See, look", I said, "We don't have to eat meat" [LAUGH].
R:  Didn't even notice the difference.
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  My friend, she ah, she's newly married, I guess it's been about two years now, but she [several inaudible words] she couldn't cook a thing, she got married and she's like [inaudible] a vegetarian and I was talking about it with her and she said, "How do you do it?", she said, "My husband, he [inaudible] me", I said, "I bet you could make things that are vegetarian and your husband would never know if you didn't say anything".
L:  That's right.
R:  So, um, my husband doesn't even know, he doesn't care, he's actually very appreciative of ah, of ah, the fact that he knows that um, he doesn't have to worry so much about eating properly 'cause he knows that I take care of that.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  He's said on many occasions, you know, "I really appreciate how ...", I mean there's no garbage in the house, and he goes like, "I always appreciate you know, we eat vegetables, we eat healthy, and, and, it's not something I really have to worry about", so, that's cool though, you know.
L:  [MN] So, what's your favorite --
R:  It's cool that he's cool about it.
L:  -- what's your favorite restaurant?
R:  My favorite restaurant, oh, there are so many, it would depend on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what I wanted.
L:  I'm living vicariously, that's why I'm asking [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, Collabas[?] is my favorite Italian restaurant --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- but we went to Maggianos[?] recently and that -- it was my first time there and I must say I liked it a real whole lot --
L:  Well, they have --
R:  Um.
L:  -- Maggianos --
