L:  [LIPSMACK] Hello, my name is Linda Elliot.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Hi, Linda, my name is Ellie Sheeley. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, [MN] I didn't hear the part -- the question, ah, didn't come clear, about what you do with the doc- -- at the doctor or something.  T- -- I -- I heard the part about what you do to stay well --
L:  Okay.  I think it was to stay well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, when the season changes,
R:  Mhm.
L:  Something to that effect.  I'm --
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  -- not sure.  I -- I -- I'm having a very hard time, um, you know, hearing.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I -- I didn't hear -- yeah, I didn't hear it real clear either.  [SIGH] Well, I guess we could talk about [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- illness and hearing. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, this is my [LAUGH] first study, so I'm a little [NOISE] nervous.
R:  Yeah.  Is this --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- your very first time --
L:  Yeah.  My very first time yeah.
R:  -- on the phone?  Oh, okay.  It's my third time --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] well, th- -- I -- I guess if we we're going to be talking about illness --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think, oh. [SIGH] The seasons don't seem to make me ill.  I'd prefer moderate weather, I don't like the winter but I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't get really depressed like some people do.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Do you?
L:  Me either.  No.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, okay, um, well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the summer, um, sometimes I get a little cold or something from using [NOISE] the air conditioner.
R:  Oh?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, that's the only time.  It doesn't have -- it really doesn't have anything to do with the [NOISE] seasons.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, just the, um, you know [NOISE] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
L:  -- just using the air conditioning. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I guess now that you mention it, since I've moved to Oklahoma I've never had allergies before and so I do dread that part of it.  I'm in the midst of some of the worst allergies that I -- I get from spring [SIGH] through to about August in that it -- that can be frustrating when it gets really bad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because then I get an infection and I get dizzy and I have had to go to the doctor maybe once a year or twice a year --
L:  Ooh.  
R:  -- and take antibiotics.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you, ah, suffer with hay fever?
R:  Yes, I do. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay, um 
R:  Never expected to. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So it's especially bad for you around --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the spring time -- the spring months?
R:  I still enjoy it --
L:  The pollen.
R:  -- but, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, do you have a change of seasons where you live?
L:  Um, yes.  Yes.  I'm on the e- east coast -- Maryland, near Washington DC.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  So, where are you?
R:  I'm in Tulsa, Oklahoma. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Mhm. [SIGH]  So, you do have probably more of a w- -- well, you --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- do -- more of a winter than we do here.  We certainly have one but not like Maryland I would think.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.  So, um [LAUGH] -- okay, now we --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, what do we [LAUGH] -- what do we do to stay well?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess that's part of it.  Well, I'm kind of health orientated, at least in outlook, but I have my lapses and I do take [SIGH] vitamins, um, somewhat sporadically -- whatever is on sale and I take echinacea if I feel like I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- catching a cold.
L:  Do you take Cla- Claritin?
R:  I'm --
L:  What is that Claritin?  Is that good?
R:  No.  No.  The echinacea is a herb that you take if you feel like you're getting an infection like a cold or something --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- the flu.  It's, um, a wild flower that grows th- -- but, I mean, they sell it now.  It's a kind of, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] it's an immune -- something to boost your immune system.
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  It actually -- it grows wild here in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Ok- Oklahoma too, [SIGH] and --
L:  So, where do you get that?  Over the counter?
R:  Yes.  You get it over the counter.  It's --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- pretty common.  But, I happened to plant one of those last week and decided that I was going to take getting well [SIGH] into my own hands.  I'm [SIGH] interested in herbology and I -- of course I go to the regular doctor and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so on.  But, I -- [SIGH] I, uh, have been reading and studying for about three years informally and I just read everything I can and I try to use herbs and --
L:  Okay --
R:  -- so on.
L:  -- so, you're studying biology now?
R:  Um, her- her- herbology --
L:  [NOISE] Herbology.  Okay.
R:  -- about how herbs affect your body and not in any formal way in a class.  I just read everything I can --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- get my hands on and --
L:  Are you planning --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- on going in the medical field.
R:  No.  I'm -- no.  I just want to know it for my own [LIPSMACK] use --
L:  Oh -- oh, okay.
R:  -- because [MN] -- yeah.  I just kinda get tired of paying th- -- what the doctors, you know, charge and I'd like to try things that are more natural if I can, to -- to get rid of something I have rather than go to the doctor and take what I would call a "drug", you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]  So 
L:  Well, that's very good.  Um, I don't know, ah, if maybe I shouldn't have chose this topic [LAUGH] to speak on because I don't have any problems --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the area, you know, like fever --
R:  Are you fairly young or ?
L:  No.  I'm actually in my forties.  So --
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  -- how old are you?
R:  I'm fifty three.
L:  Oh, are you?  You sound so young.
R:  [LAUGH] Thank you.  I think.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, um, the older you get it seems like it -- things just start to fall about and you think more about your body and how --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to preserve it. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I am a diabetic though.
R:  Oh, I see.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. So, ah, [NOISE] I guess it's --
R:  Mhm.  Hav- have you been, ah, all your life or just onset later?
L:  No, they're saying about ten years now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  But, I don't take insulin.
R:  No?
L:  Um, I just take, a pill now -- Glucovance[?].
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And, are you ab- able to manage it all right?
L:  Oh, well, sometimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It all depends.  I have my up and -- ups and downs with it.
R:  [SIGH] Um, how did you find out that you had it?  Did you get sick or did you just --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- go to the doctor?
L:  -- I just went to a routine checkup.  
R:  Mhm. [SIGH]
L:  Yes.  I didn't get sick or anything, you know.  My mother has it.  [SIGH] It runs through my family.
R:  I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I like sweets.  That's probably my down fall too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Me too [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Makes it tough.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, I, um, diet, you know, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- try to exercise and stuff.
R:  Me too.
L:  But sometimes it doesn't happen, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's not enough, um, yeah.  So, I guess, um -- how many minutes [LAUGH] is it?
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Oh, I don't know -- well, let's see -- you want me to talk for a while?  I'll just ramble for a little while and if you --
L:  Okay.  Well --
R:  -- if you, ah --
L:  -- I've got a feeling somewhere -- like I said --
R:  Okay.  If you --
L:  -- this is my first time, I guess --
R:  Oh, that's all right.
L:  -- and you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.  Ah 
L:  I don't wanna just ramble. [LAUGH]
R:  Th- [LAUGH] -- well, I --
L:  I'm [NOISE] trying to feel -- 
R:  -- gotta get to use up my ten -- 
L:  -- my way through this but you are a good talker so --
R:  Why, thank you.
L:  -- you know. [NOISE]
R:  Um. [LIPSMACK]
L:  You know, [NOISE] very in- in- interesting conversationalist.
R:  Hm.  Thank you.  Ah --
L:  [SIGH] Okay.
R:  Well, I g- -- I guess as far as health goes I think that the -- not only the --
L:  You can just talk about you. [LAUGH]
R:  Talk about me?  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  My opinions on health are that, I think that not -- it's not only about the body I think, of course, your mind and your spirit have a lot t- to effect --
L:  Yes. Yes, it does.
R:  -- your body and your outlook [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] that's important I think as far as healing oneself, um [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think -- I think the all of the [LIPSMACK] medical [NOISE] [SIGH] technology that is around now is really a wonderful thing but sometimes I think they forget the spirit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, and how -- you know how that can affec- -- an- an- and I -- I'm not saying any one religion I'm just talking about your spirit in general.  How you -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, how you connect with it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that that's very really important.  And -- and keeping a person well. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I have a good pray -- you know, I think a good pray life is important too.
R:  Yes.  [LIPSMACK] I do to.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It helps keep me focused and [LIPSMACK] it keeps me with my goals.  I try to do that so that I stay well emotionally and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- physically and all of that.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] And, ah, let's see. [LIPSMACK] Are you, um -- you're not by any chance a vegetarian are you?
L:  No.
R:  No.  No.
L:  If I were all my problems would be [LAUGH] over --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- with the diabetes, everything. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  I --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- try to be, but I -- I -- well I wouldn't say I try to be, I move towards that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- area but I'm not -- cer- certainly not totally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- vegetarian 'cause it's hard to in this society because --
L:  Yes, it is.  An- --
R:  -- your choi- -- I like to go out to eat [LAUGH] and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] your choices are limited.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So 
L:  So, um, um, do you eat a lot of meat?
R:  No, I don't.  I eat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very little meat actually.
L:  Well, I knew that anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Ah 
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.  So, chicken and fish is good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, you know, there's turkey --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- maybe, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the red meats 
R:  Right.  I don't eat a lot of red meat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, [LIPSMACK] do you -- do you have a place for a garden, or do you like to grow anything?
L:  Ah, yes --
R:  Vegetable- --
L:  -- I have a nice backyard --
R:  Do you?
L:  -- but, I don't do anything in it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Unfortunately. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No time huh?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just moved here a couple of years ago.  Yeah.
R:  I see.  From where?
L:  Um, from the DC area.
R:  Oh.  Mhm.
L:  I'm up here in Baltimore.
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  Actually, that's not far from DC.
R:  Are you in the city area or in --
L:  No, I'm in the county area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, do you know this area?
R:  Mm, oh, no I -- not really.  I went to Washington DC twice but it's been like thirty years ago [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- thirty five.  A long, long time ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I've -- I lived in Pennsylvania for -- well, I was raised in Pennsylvania but on the west- western side which is not far -- 
L:  Oh, so that's near.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
