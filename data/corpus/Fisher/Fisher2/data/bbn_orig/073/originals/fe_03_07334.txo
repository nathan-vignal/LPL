L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hey.
R:  I'm -- I'm Bonnie Rendell.
L:  Ah, I'm Stan.
R:  I'm from Texas.
L:  Oh, I'm from Tennessee.
R:  I -- so, yes -- yes, we all -- we'll sound alike then.
L:  Right. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We'll understand each other.
R:  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, I guess we're supposed to be talking about illness --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- if you caught all of that.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  It's kind --
R:  Um --
L:  -- quick.  At first I couldn't understand what she was saying.
R:  I was, like, "Okay, all right.  How 'bout hearing aids?  Let's work with that" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nah. [LAUGH]  Well, I have to be honest, we just don't get ill very often.
L:  Yeah, I don't [SIGH] -- ah, the only thing here is, um, allergies.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's the worst thing here.  I --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- guess all the stuff blooming or whatever it does, or --
R:  And I -- and I think I see that more in other people.  Um, we're -- um, I -- I work for a wellness company out of Idaho Falls, which is Melaleuca.  And, ah, we take their full vitamin program [NOISE] and their Provex, which is the grape seed extract and it's just phenomenal.  We have no allergies.  We have no asthma.  Um, if we do accidently come down with, like, a little viral something, twenty four hours later it's history.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  We just have immune systems from wherever, you know, because of this -- this tremendous program.  I haven't seen a doctor in -- oh gosh, let's see -- my little boy will ten in September -- it'll be ten years.
L:  God, no.
R:  And --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- the kids -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the kids never go.  Yeah --
L:  Maybe --
R:  -- so --
L: -- I need to see y'all.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, yeah, I love this.  I was, like, "Oh, great topic 'cause I can tell whoever's on the other line 'Here's how you can fix it'".
L:  Right.  Now, are you on nationwide, or ...?
R:  Yes.  Melaleuca is on, ah, the Internet.  Actually I have a website that you can go to and leave me your contact information.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  So, it's kind of cool.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I just have to remember 'cause I write all this stuff down and -- and I've got a couple of websites.  So, let me just give you one here.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, it -- it's, ah, W.W.W. -- um, I think it's melamela woman.
L:  Noah, noah woman.
R:  It's Mela, M.E.L.A.M.E.L.A. woman --
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  -- dotcom.
L:  [MN] Dotcom.  Okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow, okay.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  And, um, so anyway, um you can look it up, Melaleuca dot com, you know, whatever.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, it's -- ah, it's just a -- a great program.  And, um --
L:  Is it medicine, or is it just ...?
R:  No, it's -- it's all natural.  Now, we are a licensed pharmaceutical company, but, ah, everything we do, ah, is, ah, natural herbaceuticals[?].
L:  Wow.  I [MN] See, I work for, ah, a hospital supply company.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Cardinal Healthcare.
R:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  I'm a personal trainer.  And -- and, ah, we're --
L:  Oh well --
R:  -- just --
L:  -- you're in shape then.
R:  -- really in- -- yes.  Well --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I wasn't though.  Ah, I -- about a year and a half ago I started on a weight program, ah, because I just felt like I was way too -- well, actually got my vacation pictures back.
L: [LAUGH] 
R:  And I said, "Ooh, who's the whale?  Oh --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- my God, it's me". [LAUGH] 
L:  I got somebody else's pictures.
R:  Whew dog, yeah I got to lose some weight.  So [LAUGH] -- so anyway, I did.  And, ah -- and I -- I lost fifty five pounds.  And I became a --
L:  God.
R:  -- personal trainer.  And, ah, I love it, yeah.
L:  How did you lose weight by?
R:  Ah, yeah, you're gonna laugh.  But, I mean, well, you know -- and that's part of -- that's part of illness.  It's part of staying healthy.  Um, I really -- ah, I kept a food diary for two weeks.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And then, um, on that food diary I -- um, I just -- after two weeks I started eliminating five hundred calories a week, which is just simple to do.  You would be amazed at what you actually eat. [NOISE]  And, um, you know, and taking out Coke --
L:  Well, let me ask you something now.
R:  -- stuff like that.  Mhm.
L:  I've been on a diet -- I don't --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- know if this is what we're supposed to be talking about.
R:  Well, you know, being healthy --
L:  Illness.
R:  Illness.
L:  That's right.
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  It's just --
R:  People --
L:  -- an illness.
R:  -- are ill because they do not take care of their what?
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh right, their bodies.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, exactly.
L:  Well, na- -- see, I'm looking at non -- I mean, saturated fat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which -- is it better to do that, or count calories?
R:  I would rather count calories and fat grams.  Okay?
L:  Fat grams, okay.
R:  Fat grams, okay.  Look on your foods and look at your fat grams.  If you can find something in reduced fat or fat free -- okay --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- that tastes good, 'cause if you like me and it doesn't taste good I'm not staying on --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- the diet.  
L:  Right -- right.
R:  Yeah.  And I just developed my own.  I eat out almost every day.  Um, I don't have, you know, the Weight Watchers and the specially packages foods.  Our Melaleuca company does have what we call an Access bar.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Um, and on my website I -- I actually highlight that one.  Um, because it -- it -- you know, it -- what you do is you can eat that.  It's not a power bar, but fifteen minutes, ah, before a workout, or before even just exerting energy --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- you're burning fat the next two hours.  Not burning your glucose in your -- in your bloodstream, but you're actually burning fat.  It opens the fat reverses.
L:  Wow, okay.
R:  So, it's really a tremendous -- 
L:  Well, that's what I d- -- I -- I count fat grams and --
R:  Right.
L: -- then it'll -- it'll say, you know, like -- I don't know -- six fat grams.  It'll say saturated fat two --
R:  Right.
L:  -- two point five or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.
R: Why don't you do this?  Give me your phone number real quick.
L:  Okay.  Ah, six, one, five --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- three, three, five --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- three, one, five, zero.
R:  Okay.  And I'll just call you separately --
L:  Okay.
R:   -- you know, and we'll talk about it and I can send you some stuff.  But --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that's -- you know, for me it's -- I notice a lot of people do get ill.  They're sick in the fall when the -- when the-- especially allergies.
L:  Right. 
R:  They're sick in the spring.  They're sick when it really turns off cold.  Then the next thing you know, they go to the doctor, they get an antibiotic and boom -- now they're sick the rest of the year.
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  Or they --
L:  -- let's see --
R:  -- keep --
L:  -- I have been --
R:  -- getting the --
L:  -- taking --
R:  -- same thing.
L:  -- vitamins.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I can tell a big difference.
R:  Huge -- huge.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if you take a vitamin like the Melaleuca vitamin that is [inaudible] to, ah, absorb one hundred percent in your body and not waste any of it, now you really notice the difference. 
L:  Right, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I see what --
R:  It's huge.
L:  -- you're saying.
R:  It is absolutely huge.  And they're not expensive.  This is not an expensive --
L:  Well, see, like, I'm --
R:  -- company.
L:  -- seasonal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I went and got all these allergy shots.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- of course they tell me what I -- you know, I could see the big welts coming up on my arm.
R:  Yep. [LAUGH] 
L:  And I got the -- and of course I've had asthma, but I don't have it -- I -- I know when it's coming on.  I have an inhaler.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And blah -- blah -- blah.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- then I -- I get -- it's really -- it's just seasonal.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  And I notice that with a lot of people.  But, then they go out and they get the inhaler.  And they got out and they get the steroids.  Or they get the shots.  Or they get the -- the -- and then, it never goes away.  It's like a band aid, but it doesn't go away.
L:  Right.  
R:  And to me -- I know that our bodies are equipped to heal themselves.  We just have to find a right trigger.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's what I do.  I really look for the trigger, where we can enhance our body's own immune system.
L:  See, I try to -- 'cause, like, I'm on me feet all day long.
R: Yea.
L:  All day long, you --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- know.  And I -- I -- I'm trying to -- you know, like, I get those dinners that's only, you know, eight point -- ah --
R:  Good.
L:  -- six point five, you know.  And then I eat a orange.  And I take a --
R:  Good.
L:  -- some kind of bar or something.  And then I always --
R:  I'm telling you --
L:  -- take a vitamin --
R:  -- six --
L:  -- too.
R:  -- or seven small meals a day --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- are a whole lot better than -- than trying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to starve yourself --
L:  A couple of --
R:  and then --
L:  -- big ones --
R:  -- gorging --
L:  -- and -- yeah.
R:  -- at night.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  -- Exactly.  So, that's --
L:  And that's my --
R:  -- you're --
L:  -- hard -- see, like --
R:  -- exactly right.
L:  -- my hours really mess me up.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  'Cause I go in at four.
R:  Yes.
L:  And get off at twelve thirty in the --
R:  At twelve --
L:  -- afternoon.
R:  -- thirty.  Right.  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, like -- and then the rest of my family comes home at, like, five thirty or six.
R:  And they're starved?
L:  Yeah.  Well, and I am too 'cause --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I hadn't had nothing to eat from twelve to six. [LAUGH] 
R:  And you need to not do that.  Absolutely you need to not do that.
L:  Right.
R:  You have to have -- even if it's a couple of snacks through there.  You really have to do that.  And a guy -- you will actually burn more calories than a woman will anyway.  Do you have a weight loss, ah, that you wanna lose?  A -- a -- a goal.
L:  I'd like to get down to, like, one eighty five.  I'm at, like, two twelve.
R:  Oh see, that's not bad.  You --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have a real realistic goal.  You can --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- do that.  We can do that.  I mean, it's -- it's really not that hard.  So yeah, when I call you I'll go over that.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  But yeah -- but, you know, I mean, we are talking about, ah, being sick or being --
L:  Ill?  That's right.
R:  -- because I'm telling you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you're -- if you're --
L:  How to stay --
R:  -- overweight --
L:  -- away from illness.
R:  if you're overweight, if -- if -- if you're just taking nothing by antibiotics, if you're not on vitamins or you ins- -- nutrition isn't good, you're just gonna stay sick all the time.  I don't care what the doctor does --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- for you.  It -- you know, it's a revolving door.  You -- you're just in -- you're out -- you're in -- you're out, you know.  You're gonna go.  So that's -- that's my theory on it, and my family -- [MN] my nine year old hasn't been to the doctor since he was a baby.  The last --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- time he went was to get his -- you know, the -- the required shots --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- you know, by law, but that's it.  We don't -- we just don't do doctor visits.  We're just not sick. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  We -- you know, we -- last couple of years we've done real good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- them going to school and begin around kids it's --
R:  Mhm -- Mhm -- mhm.
L:  Uh-oh.  I hope my electricity doesn't go out.  We're fixing to have a heck of a storm here.
R:  Are you really?
L:  Yeah.  It's, like --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- we've had 'em off and on all day long.
R:  Oh my gosh, yeah.
L:  I've just seen --
R:  Well, this'll --
L:  -- my lights --
R:  -- be my --
L:  -- blink.
R:  -- third call, so I think --
L:  Huh?
R:  -- I think I just get three or whatever with this company.  But, I --
L: Well, how does -- you only get three and you get paid ten dollars?
R:  I think you get paid ten dollars a call.
L:  Okay.  Well, this --
R:  Yeah. 
L: -- is my second one.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, after three you don't do it no more?
R:  Well, my understanding was you just got three, so --
L:  Ha.
R:  -- I don't know.  This is my third, so we'll find out.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:   I don't know.  If I don't get the money I guess I'll know, won't I?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they said three to six weeks on the cheque.  And I was, like, "Okay".
R:  Yeah -- yeah -- yeah.  Well, I just do these for fun.  Um --
L:  Yeah, as me[?].
R:  -- but I do meet great people, ah, you --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- know, like you.  And -- and sometimes we connect really well.  And -- and if I can help somebody or whatever I'd like to do that.  So, that great.  That's what I like to do.  Yeah.
L:  Well, this -- well, this feel right in your, ah --
R:  Yeah, I can't believe that.
L:  -- your category.
R:  And I -- I just happened to look at that.  And I thought, "I think I'll try for my third call today".  And I just --
L:  you know --
R:  -- dialed it.
L:  -- my first one was about your best friend.  And I was, like, "Oh my God.  What --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- am I gonna talk about?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I got --
R:  I didn't --
L:  -- a guy.
R:  -- get that one.
L:  You know, I kind of felt --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- I felt like I was gay or something when I --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- was talking to him.
R:  [several inaudible words] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well say, John and I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, maybe the illness was a little better for you there.
L:  Right -- right.
R: [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, at least you could talk about allergies or asthma.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you know specifically what you're allergic to?
L:  Ah, course pollen tear -- tears me up.  Grass.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And, um, oh, what is it?  Ah, [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] it's some kind of, ah -- oak.
R:  Oak.
L:  Oak.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  I had, like, three or four things pop up.  And she was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  And -- and as soon as you get any kind of humidity, you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know. [LAUGH]  Just hang in there. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  And then my asthma, that -- I can feel --
R:  And you have --
L:  -- it coming on.
R:  -- asthma?
L:  Huh?
R:  You have asthma on top of that?
L:  Yeah, I have it.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, I don't it all the time.
R:  Okay.
L:  I can feel it when it comes on.  Of course --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, using a -- a what do they call it?  Albuterol --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- inhaler. [COUGH]
R:  And, ah, I have two clients now that have started the Provex Plus, which is just a -- the -- the grape seed and some ginkgo and forth.  And they're both off their inhalers after thirty days.
L:  Wow.
