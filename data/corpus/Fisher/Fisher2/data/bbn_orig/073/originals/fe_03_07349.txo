L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Are you there?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Yeah.  I'm Alice.
R:  I'm Donna.
L:  And where are you?
R:  Maine.
L:  Mai- -- oh, I'm in Flor- -- North Florida. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Florida? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're really a long way south.
R:  Yeah.  So you're keeping yourself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from illness?
L:  [MN] Yes.  Right now I am.  I have alle- -- constant allergies and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but, ah, that's living in North Florida, you learn to live with it. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Uh, we have the, uh, the pine trees right now. 
L:  Oh!
R:  [MN] Heavy, heavy pollen and everything --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, is like yellow.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Oh yes!
R:  So -- [SIGH] and the kids, you know, the allergies start --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I have to keep everything vacuumed and --
L:  Oh.
R: -- you know --
L:  Be a lot more of that, huh?
R:  Oh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's terrible.  I mean, my car's yellow -- 
L:  Oh God.
R:  -- normally it's silver.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And then, like the ponds -- we live by a pond.  It's just -- the whole top of it is just yellow --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- from the pollen.
L:  Ooh.  Well, our --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- our plant pollens down, but the, uh, -- but when the pecan trees --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- start, uh, budding out that's -- I know when that's coming --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I start.  And we went up to, um -- we're up in, ah, Pennsylvania and we're in a camp ground and there were walnut trees and they were doing [MN] -- we -- we followed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them north, you know, they'd already quit down here and boy I started again.
R:  Yes.
L:  So.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, yeah you learn to live with it.  I did -- never had any allergies when we lived in Central Florida but it's worth it living in North Florida where there are no people. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I know a lot of people in New England this year --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that have allergy problems.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  And you know, they say, "Well you've got the Benadryl" and what not.  I don't like pumping the kids full of that.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think it's healthy --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's -- you're gonna have it, you're gonna to have it.
L:  Gonna have it.  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know like hot steam -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- you know, water boiling on the stove helps --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- put moisture in the air. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I like just the natural --
L:  Mhm --
R:  -- remedies.
L:  -- the natural things.
R:  Of course, you know, I'm on B.P. so I can't take any of that stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yep.  That's -- that's the -- my problem.  The only thing I can take is, ah, +Chlortrimeton and I use that year round. [LAUGH]
R:  Do ya? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] It has, uh, -- it won't bother you if you're on, uh, any kind of blood pressure medicine so 
R:  Really?
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  No I --
L:  And I just found out that Wal-Mart sells it -- their equate brand for about a third of the price so 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have not had any trouble with [LAUGH] it.
R:  Well, good.
L:  So.
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, but it seems every year it's getting worse and worse.
L:  That's right.
R:  Ah, I don't know why.  Even the -- ah, the bugs this year are a lot worse.
L:  Well, are you a smoker?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] so am I.  That's what the doctor keeps telling me, that's why I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- real bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but, um, you know, even -- it's just the people that I know that don't smoke --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's [MN] -- it's just the -- the pollen.  I think it has a lot to do with El Nino.
L:  Uh-huh.  I think --
R:  Because the temperature changes.  
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.


R:  [LIPSMACK] And, ah, the ticks this year.  Nobody even wants to go out because we're so inundated with them.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh.
R:  Even down in Massachusetts too.
L:  Ooh!  Huh.
R:  They never had a problem where my -- my parents live.
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  And, now they're just covered.
L:  Ooh!
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  We haven't had that problem yet.  We've had, um -- do you know what I mean by chiggers[?]?
R:  Yep.  Mhm.
L:  Red bugs?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm telling you I'm covered.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Every time I get out in the yard they just -- even no bug spray seems to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do any good.
R:  And what was the other part of the question?
L:  Um  I think it was just illnesses.
R:  Uh, what -- what do you do to prevent ?
L:  What do you do to prevent.  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  I don't [NOISE] know much that I can -- I don't know much what I c- -- you can p- -- do to prevent it.
R:  No. [LAUGH]  No.  Ah, stay indoors and that doesn't help. [LAUGH]  Just [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you don't keep vacuuming. [LAUGH]


R:  I know, and then in the winter time --
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we've got the wood stove going --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the furnace --
L:  Uh-huh.  So that --
R:  -- and that causes allergies too.
L:  Yeah. That's right. [LIPSMACK]
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, basically I'm year round. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] You're -- it -- we had friends that we -- that had to keep their air conditioning running year round --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- and um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- argh, they said that they couldn't even turn the heat on, well I don't know how they managed that but [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So 
R:  I know up in here in Maine you don't want the air conditioner --
L:  No [LAUGH] you can't -- 
R:  -- on in the winter time. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.


R:  But, um, no, I don't know.  I -- you know, like I said I just keep the moisture going.  My humidifier goes all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- night long.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Because our furnace is still running at night.
L:  Yeah.  Oh it is?
R:  Well, yes because at night time it gets rather chilly here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, we have forced air.
L:  Oh, yes so 
R:  And, it blows up --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- all the dust that accumulates down --
L:  Right.
R:  -- down the vent.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I have to vacuum them out [MN] --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- put on the humidifier, --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R: -- my electric bill goes up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't have to take them in to the doctors. [LAUGH]
L:  Y- -- right, right.  So, you save on that part. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  They're not cheap --
L:  And how many children do you have?
R:  Pardon?
L:  How many children do you have?
R:  I have two.
L:  Two.
R:  Yeah.  One's, ah -- my son's seventeen --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then my daughter's twelve.
L:  Oh.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mine are all gone --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but the grandchildren are coming back. [LAUGH]
R:  Ahah, yeah. It's just a --
L:  We --
R:  -- cycle.
L:  -- we live out in the country -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and they're -- they all lives sort of close to us so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're here a lot.  And we have several -- we have one with asthma in the family, she's just about to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- outgrow it though so 
R:  Hm.  See where we live we're way out in the country --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we're in the boonies. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah ok- [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  All it is, is I have one neighbor --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  And we're just surrounded by trees.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's the way we are too. 
R:  Yeah, and that's --
L:  We're, ah, -- we're twelve, thirteen miles from the closest grocery store.  And, ah --
R:  Yeah, that's about us too.
L:  And we, ah, just not [COUGH]-- just not too long ago that somebody called about, "Did we want to get cable?" and so we told them where we lived you know, and they said, "Yeah, about a hundred years you may get cable". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- we're pretty far off.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, you know that -- it make it's a lot worse --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the trees and the --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- pollen because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you've got the maples and all that.
L:  But I wouldn't change where I live.  I wouldn't move in to the city for that [LAUGH] -- to get away from it.
R:  Ah, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I kind of like the city.  That's where I grew up.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  My husband dumped me here.
L:  Oh, so 
R:  But I never -- I never had these allergies when I was in the city.
L:  Well, I never had them 'til I moved up here, so 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, it could be part of it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  So  [COUGH]
R:  But, ah, I don't really think there is anything the doctor can do other than, um, -- ah, what is -- oh, what's that?  It starts with a C.  Clara- Claritin?
L:  Claritin, ahah.
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  Yeah, I tried that at one time but it didn't help me.  One of my grandchildren -- granddaughters is on it and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it does help her during the worst of the season.
R:  Right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it did help him and, this is -- I'm talking when it was prescription.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, you know, it -- it made him too groggy.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, when he was in school -- when he came home he was just totally wiped --
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]
R:  So I thought, "I'd rather have him suffer a little bit" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, give him some --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- cough drops, menthol --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and a lot of water --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and ah --
L:  Now we, ah, -- we f- -- I found out that if I keep a glass of ice water by the bed if I start during the night, that really stops me -- will stop me from coughing.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So   But one of my sons is a fireman and of course, being -- having to drive a fire truck he can't take any of those medications.
R:  No.
L:  And, ah, he really suffers.  
R:  Hm.
L:  But only in the winter surprisingly, he doesn't -- doesn't bother him in the summer, so I don't know what his allergies are.
R:  Hm, um, have to be to do with the furnace -- the heating but, if he heats --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the winter, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I know, um, I have to run a humidifier year round --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- to keep moisture in here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Plus we have a lot of paneling --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, [NOISE] um, you know, weather like this, it's been like raining every day.
L:  Hm.  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  So, everything's, ah, it's -- you get that musty odor.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doesn't help but that's mould --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and pollen.
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  And I don't know -- I can't do anything about that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You can only clean so much. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know it. [LAUGH] It's awful.
L:  The rest of it's there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm ready to go to sleep now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah. Oh, gosh.
R:  But, um, now, um, was there anything else she asked about, do you know?
L:  I don't think there was.  I don't, uh -- I don't know anything else.
R:  No.
L:  In that my husband's also doing it, he'll probably get a call just as soon as we hang up. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] He'll discuss the same thing.
R:  Really?  I got one last night too.
L:  Yeah, so did we about food. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So 
R:  I wonder why they're really, ah, -- any old way -- [LIPSMACK] survey. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But, um -- so, you have the internet service there?
L:  Ah, y- yes [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- we do with my, ah, daughter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She has the computer and lives on our land and [NOISE] --
R:  Ooh.
L:  So, we -- she does the computer work and I do the [LAUGH] telling her what to do. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  No, I -- I can't really think of anything more other than I don't like pushing, [NOISE] ah, the chemicals --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to the kids.  Especially the kids, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they're s- -- they're minds are still forming.
L:  Well, and you don't know [NOISE] what, ah, the lasting effects are going to be.
R:  That's it.
L:  [COUGH] Like the things that twenty years ago they were taking for morning sickness and then find out what it can cause, so 
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's just like this thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with the, ah, -- [MN] the, ah, estrogen replacements?
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  My mother just about died.  She says, "I've been on those things for twenty --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- some odd years". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  So have I, because I had a hysterectomy when I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was forty. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ah, get off these things quick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, maybe +I'm too late for it.  But ah 
R:  And, y- you know, a lot of these drugs they're just pushing them on the market without really having a good --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- test period.
L:  Without a -- yeah [inaudible].
R:  I'd like to see like twenty years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, what side effects you're going to develop.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um -- so you got -- I -- I guess I'm really wary on any kind of meds going into somebody.
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
