R:  James Stockley.
L:  Hi, my name's Debbie.
R:  Debbie?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, somebody's on the line.  Okay.  I went up -- I walked -- I -- I got up a minute and he was on the line.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you located?
L:  In Louisville, Kentucky.
R:  Okay.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  New Jersey, Algen City.
L:  Okay.  And our topic is -- well, she named off a few different things.  I know personal habits and there was something about excessive eating and smoking.
R:  Oh.
L:  Things with caffeine.
R:  Okay.
L:  There was a variety of things she talked about.  So, I guess that's pretty good.
R:  Uh, okay.  Well, I didn't answer nothing, right?
L:  Pardon?
R:  I don't get a chance to answer anything do I?
L:  Okay.  So, that -- you didn't hear what the topics were?
R:  Excess- -- the eating part.
L:  Yes.  She had said like excessive eating.
R:  Well, that's me.  I eat a lot.
L:  Oh, you do?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do -- I guess sometimes it depends on what it is.  Sometimes maybe more with junk food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sometimes you can get a little bit carried away with that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then I know she had said -- one of the things they -- she had said was, um, alcohol and then something with drugs and ...
R:  I don't do drugs.
L:  No, I don't do drugs either.
R:  No.
L:  Alcohol, maybe an occasional wine cooler or something.
R:  I haven't drunk one in a while, but I like 'em.  I like beer too.  The last time I drunk a beer was, uh ...
L:  No, I'm not a beer drinker.
R:  No, I'm not.  No.
L:  Yeah.  No, I meant me.  I don't even care for the taste of it.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.  Like I had a beer it was a long time ago.  Not long, about -- less -- a little less than a year.  I drink beer once in a while.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  But I drink beer like -- like almost a year ago then -- like it had been like three years before that.  So, I'm not a drinker.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I like wine coolers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't drunk them in a while.
L:  'Cause sometimes I think they have such flavors with those that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some of them almost taste like cool aids -- anymore -- they've got such a variety of flavors.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's one ...
L:  But some of 'em you don't realize that there's alcohol and I don't think they're very strong.
R:  I drink a lotta juice.  Right now I'm drinking, uh, Lipton -- Lipton, uh, lemonade.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, at least that's good for ya.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think she -- well, you said, we've touched on drugs.  Don't do those.
R:  No.
L:  I know they can be -- can be very bad and habit forming.
R:  Yeah.  I see people -- I've seen people use drugs.  I had a friend that, uh -- he was a -- I don't know -- I guess he used a needle, you know, drugs like way.  I ...
L:  And I've never -- never known of anybody to do anything like that.
R:  I know that person that did it.  Yeah.  I seen him do it before.  But he ...
L:  That would have to be -- that'd have to be tough -- tough to watch somebody go through that.
R:  But he died three years ago.  So ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I've read various magazine articles.  I read just one here recently talking about even like painkillers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you don't realize some of the medications that doctors can put you on ...
R:  Yeah.  Like about the drugs thing I would take 'em like just on a general [inaudible], you know?  But no way, I don't even really drink.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The hard liquor, uh, no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll do like beer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like once in a -- you know, but the last time it was like -- like maybe a little less than a year ago I had a beer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and before that it's been years.  But I -- I haven't had a wine -- wine cooler in a long -- the last wine drink I had was, uh -- my grandfather had, uh, some [inaudible] he had.  It was real sweet.  Yeah, I t- tasted it.  I really didn't like it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That was like, uh, oh, a few years ago.
L:  Yeah.  As I said, I'm not big with that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think one of the other topics they had talked about discussing was, um, eating.  We talked about that.  She said so many how I'm like how in the world am I supposed to remember each one of these, what they said 'cause it's okay, you know, I mean, there's no way you could take down -- write something down like that.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, yeah, eating would be -- I think that's a big thing nowadays.  And I think there was something with exercise.
R:  Oh.
L:  They might've had something on there about exercise and overeating.  So, I guess they would kind of go together with that 'cause nowadays I think that's a big thing, people trying to watch their diets and -- and it's not good for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's so many health things that can go wrong with ya.
R:  Yeah.  This whole ...
L:  So, exercising I've been -- the most couple of months I've been taking up walking.
R:  I used to exercise.  I used to lift weights a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I started -- like, I started going back to the gym, you know?
L:  That's a good -- I mean, it's a good thing to get into.  I've just never done a gym, but I've been trying to work out --
R:  Well, when I ...
L:  -- walking a couple of miles a day.
R:  I -- I don't think I would, you know -- when I lost weight before, uh -- I used to wear that, uh, plastic bag.  That's the best way you lose weight.  You put the bag on.  They say it's dangerous, you know, like a trash bag or ...
L:  Uh-huh.  I've never heard of that.
R:  You put it over and it makes you sweat and you lose weight.  That's -- that's the way to lose it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But anything I just ...
L:  Yeah.  I've never heard of that.  I've just tried, um -- just watch certain things that you eat or cut out on some of the junk food.
R:  Yeah, that's what I do.  But right now I'm leaving by myself.  So, I gotta --
L:  Sometimes it's ...
R:  -- motivate myself.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes it's easier because if you don't -- well, as long as you don't buy it then you don't have it there to eat --
R:  Well, I buy ...
L:  -- 'cause you'd have to buy it, uh, to have it there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, sometimes it's better -- it's harder if you've got someone there with ya 'cause then they might want something or have more snacks there and ...
R:  Well, one of the -- oh, excuse me.  Sorry to interrupt.  But there's two big supermarkets --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Super Fresh and a Thrift Way and then a couple of [inaudible] and I live right next -- near me.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, when it's convenient sometimes to go out and get stuff its there if you want it.
R:  Yeah.  But, uh, I don't know.
L:  And for exercise, like I said -- you said you work out at the gym and ...
R:  I used to lift weights a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'd like to start back again.
L:  It's hard getting back started.
R:  Yeah.  But I look at the, uh, same age limit though.  You can be -- I see someone like the bodybuilders, like one guy was in his sixties.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Well, like [inaudible] you can be, you know -- like -- like most of the weightlifters, the bodybuilders in their forties.  So, it's not like you plan like a sport when you get old.  You can lift weights and you can be, you know, just as, you know, good shape as anybody else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  You can do that 'cause sometimes those -- the gyms get expensive if you stay in ...
R:  Yeah.  They got gyms here that, uh -- one's like -- it's like forty five dollars a month now.
L:  Yeah.  Some of 'em can get expensive.  They're good for you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then sometimes some people if they can get the -- the home -- the equipment at home you could just do the same at home.
R:  You're loc- -- where are you located again?
L:  In Louisville, Kentucky.
R:  Oh, wow!  Wow!  That's just basketball culture there from Kentucky [inaudible].
L:  You said you're, what, New Jersey?
R:  Yeah, Ocean City.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  Never been there.
R:  You've never been to New Jersey?
L:  I've been through it to Atlantic City, but that's it.
R:  Oh, that's -- we're like about fifteen minutes from Atlantic City.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, casinos.
L:  Yeah, I've been there a couple of times.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But, uh, I've heard of Ocean City, but never ...
R:  Did you stay in a casino -- or were you at a casino?  Did -- did you gamble?
L:  Um, yeah, stayed there near the casino.
R:  Okay.
L:  A couple -- a couple of streets off from it.
R:  'Cause it's like they're got the Pacific Atlantic -- they've got a famous place like the White House and they've got like [several inaudible words].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Those are expensive shore towns.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, if you're there along the beach sometimes it's easy to walk around that and -- along the beach or something then for exercise.
R:  Yeah, we've got a boardwalk too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that'd be easy to walk.
R:  I used to run the boardwalk years ago, but I can't do it now.  I get too tired.  But I used to run up and down the boardwalk.
L:  Now, that's good.  Yeah.  You see a lotta people that run.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Either walk or do running or do the jogging.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, that's good for exercise.
R:  Yeah.  But ...
L:  Now, do you take vitamins or anything?
R:  No.  Um, no, uh, I got --
L:  I ...
R:  -- they have some new -- new vitamin they was advertising on the local radio and I was gonna try it, but I never t- -- it's called, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- C. -- C. silver, probably a liquid, uh, vitamin.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I haven't -- I don't take vitamins now.
L:  Now, I do take ...
R:  I take maybe [inaudible] or aspirins when I've got a headache or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or when I got a -- a toothache.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I gotta take, you know ...
L:  And sometimes I guess you're not sure how much -- what you really get -- if you're getting everything that you need with some of the foods 'cause if you don't eat all the food groups --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with your diet then I do make sure I take a vitamin.  I figure that way I'm kinda covered and then sometimes, especially wintertime, try to double up on like the C.'s.
R:  I just wish I could, you know, become a -- a vegetarian.  That would help.  I always wanted to, you know, do that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause the way I see it is the vegetarians are -- they're in good shape.
L:  That's something -- I've never been around somebody that is a vegetarian.
R:  Yeah.  A couple of people here are.
L:  'Cause I'm not that and I've never been around somebody that is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That'd be something new or different.
R:  Hey, let me ask you about Louisville.  How big is that?  Is it a big city?  I know they've got a basketball -- Louisville Colonels and ...
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's a -- it's a good sized town.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm at New Jersey -- like the people come out here from Florida --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and Pennsylvania to vacation, then they go back in the wintertime to Florida --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, I mean, it's like, you know ...
L:  'Cause it can cold in the winter, can't it?
R:  Yeah.  Snow.
L:  Yeah, I would think ...  Yeah.
