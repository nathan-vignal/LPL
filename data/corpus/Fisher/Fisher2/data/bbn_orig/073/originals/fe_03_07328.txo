R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] This is Adele[?].
R:  My name's Aaron.
L:  Hi, Aaron.  So, seven days or one week, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I thought that was pretty clever.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R: I didn't quite understand the last part of, ah, the -- the survey.  The --
L:  The seven --
R:  -- if we go --
L:  -- day -- ah, go ahead.
R:  If we go to a doctor?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Is that the question?  Okay.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  It's if we go to a doctor in -- [NOISE] within seven days or if -- ah, whatever.  Anyway, it was basically saying the same thing.  It was just wording it differently.  I thought that was kind of clever. [LAUGH] 
R: [LAUGH] 
L:  But -- so, what do you do to stay healthy, wealthy and wise?
R:  I -- the -- the main thing that I do is preventative.  Um, and I guess the thing that I follow most is Hypocrites saying, where he says let your medic- -- let your food be your medicine and let you medicine be your food.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, basically I -- I, um, try to eat healthy.  And of course there's a lot of, um -- a lot of differences of opinion on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what is healthy eating.  And -- and, um, sometimes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we think we know and -- and other people say you're wrong.  So --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'm a -- I like to -- I like to look into it and -- and study nutrition and see what's, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what is good for me, to keep me healthy.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- that seems to be working, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, and I'd have to say I'm -- I'm along the same line.  Um, in fact, right now I'm making a homemade potpie, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  I just had my son, ah, roll out the, ah, dough. [LAUGH]  I said, "I can't do it, I got the phone".  But, ah, I am along the same line as, ah, in the preventive.  When I do find myself or even one of my kids becoming ill I, um, immediately start them echinacea and Rose-Ox.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, if it's, like, an upper respiratory or a cold that's coming along.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, specially with the change of the seasons.  Um, in the spring and fall you get the different pollens and all that kind of --
R:  Are -- 
L:  -- stuff.
R:  -- you affected by those?
L:  I -- yo- -- normally I'm not, but I would have to say this year I found my eyes itching a lot.
R:  Hm.
L:  And I have an asthmatic son, [NOISE] so obviously he's the first one to let us know when things are happening [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- you know.  So, um -- but, ah, I just find it amazing the fact that we are careful about what we eat and, um, using the different herbs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, how that does just seem to -- to help relieve a lot.
R: Oh --
L:  So --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- it's --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- it's -- it is amazing.  I don't know.  I just like to try and stay away from any kind of medications as much as possible.
R:  Oh, I hear you.
L:  You know?
R:  I think --
L:  There's too --
R:  -- it --
L:  -- many side effects. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ye- -- oh, they're awful, [MN] including, um, being carcinogenic.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And, ah, I know one thing, speaking of cancer -- that I, um, try to really, ah, take into my body is raw foods, just because it's o- -- ah, only the raw foods that are alive.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] it's the live foods that have the enzymes intact that can take hold of those free radicals and cancer causing agents and stuff, and get 'em out of your body, and -- and keep you, ah, clean and healthy.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I guess another thing that I do [MN] to help boost the immune system -- um, I'm not big on supplements.  I -- I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't like popping pills --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I take a -- a, um [NOISE] -- a nutrient shake.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just a vanilla shake that has, ah, vitamins and minerals and herbs and proteins.  And, um, it's called Reliv.  I don't know if you --
L:  Oh.
R: -- ever heard of that.
L:  Mhm -- mhm.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, it -- it does really -- it really keeps me from -- I don't know -- that and the food I think keeps me pretty healthy.
L:  Healthy, yeah.  Isn't it amazing though --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, how that does?  'Cause I use a similar product, um, to herbalize --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- which they --
R:  I know --
L:  -- also have --
R:  -- Herbal.
L:  -- that.  Yeah.  And -- and, um, I do that and I also watch my sugar intake.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so -- so, th- this morning, you know, I thought, "Well, let's see.  What can I have?"  So, I didn't want a shake, so I didn't do that, but I made, um, oatmeal apple pancakes.  And it's just amazing, like, when you make your own foods and use your -- you know, the -- the -- the stone grounds and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just all that, um, how much -- you can go for the whole day with one -- energy and not feeling sluggish, ah, but you would if you used the processed stuff.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Processed foods are just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- are so accessible, and the sugar -- like you said -- I'm -- I'm --
L:  It's --
R:  -- trying to cut back too.  I'm --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- getting married next month --
L:  Ah. 
R:  -- so I'm --
L:  Well, congratulations.
R:  -- trying to lose weight.  So --
L: [LAUGH] Oh, I --
R:  -- keeping --
L:  -- thought that --
R:  -- away --
L:  -- was only the bride. [LAUGH] 
R:  W- what's that?
L:  I said, "I thought it was only the bride that tried to lose the weight".
R:  Oh, no --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um, the sugar is -- is a big thing.  I -- I get addicted to it, but I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's kind of an ambivalent relationship because I -- I love -- you know, I have a sweet tooth, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yet, it's the very thing that destroys your immune system.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's, um -- I don't know if the word -- a catch twenty two, if that's appropriate.
L:  Well --
R:  But --
L:  -- it -- it could very well be, because, um, that is, ah -- there's something that I think of people are aware of, but because we have so many sugars in so many different things --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- um, they see it as a lot of work.  And basically --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- what it is, is -- is breaking a habit.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And I --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- can't say that I'm perfect because there's times when I slip.  I mean, last night I had some M and Ms.  But, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, it's -- you do, because like you said, it -- it -- it doesn't help your immune system, and then you can't stay healthy --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- once -- once you've, um, caused imbalance in the system.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- but, we have a son who -- he's still hyper -- he's sixteen.  But, um, when he was little he was extremely hyper and we had a choice of either putting him on Ritalin or a food diet.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, due to the fact that I am not a drug -- you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- know, go for 'em type person, um, we did the food.  And it was very hard because there's no processed foods.  There's nothing.  You -- you basically had to go to a co-op, and you basically had to learn how to make things from scratch.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I see it as very beneficial for this young man because even though, um, he had to learn what he could and could not eat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, he was not drugged.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- you know, that's the thing about Ritalin.  I don't think people realise what --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it does.
R:  It's --
L:  Um --
R:  -- awful.
L:  [LAUGH] Besides the fact that you're -- you're giving it to a child whose body is growing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you're really messing up their whole system.
R:  Yeah.  I knew a -- um, a young boy who -- he's -- ah, he's fifteen years old and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- weighs, [LIPSMACK] ah, sixty nine or seventy nine pounds -- one of the other --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for fifteen.  When I was fifteen I was -- man --
L:  Ah, my --
R:  -- I was at least a hundred and fifty. [LAUGH] 
L:  I was gonna say my kids are roughly about that, yeah.  'Cause I've got three teenage boys and they're all between a hundred and fifty -- maybe a hundred and fifty at the most --
R:  Yeah.  And this --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- kid had ADD and was on Ritalin.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I -- [MN] it stunts your growth.  But, I'm glad you guys don't use that, but --
L:  No.
R:  [MN]
L:  I try to convince other people, but they just look at me, like, "Well, my doctor knows".  I'm thinking, "Yeah, right".
R:  Right.  They --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They --
L:  He just --
R:  -- invest --  
L:  -- knows what the pharmaceutical --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- company tells him. [LAUGH] 
R:  They invest in what their doctors invest in.
L:  You're right.
R:  They invest their time and their money and their years of education to something, so they -- they would give their lives for it, and then all their patients will do the same, 'cause --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- they know they've done that.  But --
L:  Yeah.  And -- and -- and it's too bad, because like -- like we had mentioned earlier nutrition does play such a big part.  And it's not the, ah, fault of the doctors.  But, they are so much into the curing and not the preventive that a lot of 'em don't necessarily understand, or don't have the time, or don't wanna take the time maybe to learn about the nutrition.  I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I happen to be lucky to have a doctor that -- you know, he does -- he's not one hundred percent, but he does, you know, admit that nutrition has a lot to do with your health, wealth --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- and wellbeing and whatnot.
R:  I mean, when I -- when I think about it, what -- what is -- what is it that we were created to eat?  I don't know.  Some people believe in creation.  Some people believe in evolution.  But, either way you look at it our bodies were either created or evolved to eat one particular, um, style of food, and that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, fruits and veggies that are raw even.
L:  Mhm -- mhm.
R:  And here we're putting in so many other things into our bodies that -- that ultimately are not ideal.  And -- and it prevents, you know, death -- dead foods prevent -- beget death and disease, just as --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- life begets life.  Life food --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- begets health and life.
L:  Yep.  And -- and it's -- um, here's the way I've always looked at it -- is if it can stay on the shelf for [LAUGH] more than a week, do I really want that in my body? 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- do I wanna pickle myself?  I don't think so.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] But it is, and I think that really has a key as to whether you're -- you stay healthy or not.  And -- and you'll, um, probably notice too that more people are eating more junk food -- are usually the ones that are usually going to the doctors, or not feeling well, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- don't have the energy, or --
R:  And I --
L:  -- you know, they're --
R:  -- think too -- yeah, you're right.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think too that even the Cancer Society and the D- Diabetic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Association and the cardio people [LAUGH] -- they're all putting labels on their -- or, ah, on their things -- on their brochures or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whatever telling about -- that we -- we know that nutrition plays a vital part in -- in the health of, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- disease prevention.  I think -- I think they're eventually gonna be forced to come along and -- and admit or, you know, concede to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to show that these -- these -- this is the way to go.  But --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- then again, I think the big thing behind it, um, is money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's gonna prevent a lot of -- of true knowledge and -- and health because people wanna make their own livings and -- and come up with a product that at least reaches a symptomatic level that appears to do some -- some good at a symptomatic level --
