R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Debbie and I'm from Georgia.
R:  Ah, I'm Rhonda and I'm from Texas -- ah --
L:  Where in Texas?
R:  Ah, I'm in the Metraplate[?] area -- well, the surrounding area of, of the Metraplate --
L:  I don't know what that is -- my, my father's in Beaumont[?].
R:  Okay, Dallas, Fort Worth, Metraplate [NOISE].
L:  Oh okay [MN] -- okay, well, what do you -- what illness -- what do you want to say?
R:  [NOISE] Okay, well, the main topic that they gave us was -- how do we stay -- during whatever weather -- how do we --
L:  The change of season.
R:  -- prevent illness --
L:  Change of seasons it said -- many people change -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- get sick in change of seasons.
R:  Um, and basically -- usually um, since I haven't been to the doctor and I don't have insurance currently because I need a fulltime job for that, um, usually I end up getting sick, whether it be a small cold or symptoms of a cold, ah, laryngitis, um, I face that a lot with the change in seasons especially from winter to summer, summer to spring --
L:  So, what do you do to pre- -- to try to help yourself is basically kind of what the topic's about -- what do you do?
R:  Well there's -- there's really not anything that I can do because, um, I really do need to have some type of medicine to keep from getting it because it's just -- whenever the seasons change it's -- I can pretty much anticipate somewhere in that season change, I'm going to eventually lose my voice in one or two days --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- though I -- I can't do anything without going to the doctor to see what's going on, and so --
L:  So, if you feel yourself getting snuff- -- ah, stuffy or um, like you feel like you're getting kinda getting it to come on -- you don't take an antihistamine, or decongestant or any of that stuff to help you feel better bef- -- to help you avoid it, or vitamin C which is generally considered a cold medicine, you know -- or E [inaudible] --
R:  Well, I -- I try to stay away from the cold medicines as much as possible in the decongestants and usually I take Beyer aspirin, but I still end up along the way feeling really bad, even taking aspirin, because, most of the time, throughout the day I don't know what's going on with my body, and maybe physically um --
L:  Is something else wrong with you?
R:  -- I think so, because I stay tired all the time and so, like I say, I really try to stay away from as much over the counter as I can --
L:  Okay, so --
R:  -- until I can get back under the doctor -- so there's not too much I can prevent from what's happening until I find out medically what's going on with me.
L:  Okay, well, it's like -- I have a heart condition, okay -- and my doctor says, you know, to help yourself, you -- you know, to keep [NOISE], you know, keep from you getting any worse, um, you need to take vitamin C and vitamin E -- take eight hundred milligrams of vitamin E, 'cause vitamin E is a healing vitamin -- you can take that all the time and it's good for everybody, you know -- that's kind of the, the thing I do and ah, I take vitamin C, and you know, like when I see the -- the seasons like if it gets real real cold and I know I'm gonna sick -- 'cause I'm real susceptible to bronchitis and -- and laryngitis too [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so um, that -- since I've started taking the, the vitamins that they told me to take, which were non prescription medicine, and, they keep you know, there's a -- antihistamine that used to be a prescription, it's not any more, um, the -- the one I take is Claridyn --
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I take that and that kinda helps prevent me from having to go the doctor, and pay the money for the doctor, so that's --
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  -- how I do it.
R:  But the thing about it, your doctor has already prescribed it, I don't wanna ah --
L:  But you don't need a prescription for, for over the counter cold medic- -- um, you know, for -- to help you --
R:  [inaudible] [NOISE]
L:  -- open your sinuses or, or vitamins, I mean that's not a prescription -- you -- you read every mag -- any magazine you want to look at, um, today, tells you -- vitamin E, vitamin C, the B complex vitamins, they all are healing vitamins -- they're to keep from having to pay to go to the doctor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, you know, with this, you know, the normal -- you -- you know, even on TV, on the news they're saying, you know, hey, you know like, common colds, you, you -- everybody gets it -- it's going to last the same amount of time, you know, if you get it -- whether you take another -- a prescription medicine -- if they put you on an antibiotic or not, you're still going to have the cold, the same amount of time, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] Okay [inaudible] --
L:  -- but trying to prevent it -- for them is to keep vitamins and keep yourself healthy.  Do you run?
R:  [MN] Ah, I don't exercise because, like I said, it -- right now, I've been physically weak and overly tired, therefore it's something more than what I can see, and basically I supplement the vitamins through my food -- I eat plenty of potassium through bananas, ah --
L:  That's a great -- yeah.
R:  Ah, green vegetables, and like I said, I'm staying away from [NOISE] the over the counter things because I know something more is going on, because I used to take vitamins and I still suffered from it, so I'm just overlapping the illness with things that I don't know--
L:  No you're not.  You're taking your --  you're -- you're healing your, your, um, blood cells -- it's -- it's reinforcing the blood cells, I mean just like biology -- did you take biology in school?
R:  Yes.
L:  -- 'cause that's what it, you know, in school but -- you know, they show you -- how, how vitamins, a continuous amount of vitamin will help heal, you know, even when you have a burn you take vitamin E and you put it on the burn --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it helps speed the healing process up -- that's proven.
R:  [NOISE] And, and I guess [several inaudible words] through my food count -- and through what I do eat and drink the vitamins are taken care of, so I don't [several inaudible words] --
L:  Well, if you knew that you were dying -- if, if the doctor told you, "You're dying and there's nothing I can do", um -- you wouldn't go out and, and look on your own and see what the books say, and magazines say -- 
R:  Probably not.
L:  -- if they said take vitamins, um, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't do that?  
R:  No.
L:  I mean, you wouldn't do something to try to improve yourself, 'cause that's what it sounds like.
R:  No.
L:  You wouldn't?  You'd just watch yourself die?
R:  Yes, probably would, because he knows more than I will ever know.
L:  Who knows?
R:  That's true.
L:  God, God knows more than you know?  Is that what you're saying, or your doctor?
R:  Yes, he knows what's best for me, more than I do.
L:  Well, I agree with you, and he -- that's why he -- that's why he put all these substances on earth for -- for us to help -- help us help ourselves [MN].  Mm.
R:  Yes.
L:  Right?  Don't you believe God wants you to help yourself?
R:  Well, I've done it throughout those past five years and um, [inaudible] --
L:  But five years is, is one fifth of your life -- not even one fifth.
R:  Yeah.  And, it still occurs with everything that I've done, so like I say --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- God knows best.
L:  Well, sure God knows best [LAUGH].
R:  So, we -- we just -- --
L:  I'm, I am dying, I have -- I have a heart condition --
R:  Yep. 
L:  -- there is nothing to do about it, and I am dying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'm sure not gonna just say, "God, I give up", God tells me i- -- you help yourself and I'll help you -- I do work miracles, but I work miracles to other things in the world -- I may have -- they told me, ah, three years ago, that I only had eight months to live, so I started taking -- I started everything I possibly could -- everything -- they never -- they said they didn't know -- you know, hey, it's a miracle Debbie, what have you done?  I pray every night.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I do, I -- I say -- I currently do that throughout the day, even with my eyes open because, like I know -- say I -- I believe at this point, God knows best --
L:  Well, God does know best.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  He puts you -- a brain on, on us to make sure we use 'em, not just because, oh god you -- you make my arm move if, if -- you have to tell -- you have a brain that tells you to do certain things  --
R:  Well, I -- I -- 
L:  -- and if you don't do that you're not utilizing God's power the way he wanted to -- 'cause he gave us a choice.
R: Yeah, yeah tr- -- that's correct, however, like I said, I've tried my way and my brain and I --
L:  And you're not getting any better.
R:  Right, so I think -- I believe um, I'm staying away from everything and --
L:  Well, maybe you're depressed too.
R:  -- saying God knows best.
L:  Are you depressed too?
R:  Well, I -- I can't really say that -- I guess it, um, God knows that.
L:  'Cause depression will, depression will just -- will kill us.  I mean, it just about killed me for a while --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- when I put -- I had to go to the doctor for that -- for an antidepressant, just to be able to deal with what I have to deal with, but um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- depression will kill us in itself.  And that's why I wouldn't even worry about the insurance, I'd go and tell the, you know -- and the doc- the doctors will work with you on the money too.  I owe one doctor thirty thousand dollars right now, because I haven't -- I don't work either, 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I'm sure not going to let myself die and suffer 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because that's ...
