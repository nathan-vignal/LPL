L:  Good evening, my name is May.
R:  Hi, my name's Betty.  I guess our topic is food.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Ah, do you -- ah, go out often to eat in a restaurant?
R:  Um, not too often.  
L:  You sound --
R:  My hus- -- my husband doesn't really like to go out too much.
L:  -- fair enough, but you sound as if you cook very well, um, you cook meals very well at home.
R:  Well, I just cook home cooking.  Old Pennsylvania Dutch cooking.
L:  Well, considering ah, very often if you don't eat in very expensive restaurants the food that they do serve is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- prepackaged, frozen, um -- home cooking [LAUGH] is the best, trust me.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think so too [LAUGH]. We have a restaurant out here, um, and um, [inaudible] Nights --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- run it, and people just rave about their cooking you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- "Oh, it is so good", and all it is is just plain farm cooking.
L:  Well, you know, like, seriously most of the restaurants they don't cook on premise, they buy the food, [MN] ah, they bring the food in frozen, they just heat it up.
R:  I think so too.
L:  So, that's why, you know, what you say is home cooking is really good.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, this, ah restaurant I was talking about -- now, they used to have really good pies, and, um, but anymore -- I think that they, you know, they do so much business I think they buy the um, [LIPSMACK] crusts ready made --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and the filling and then they just put 'em together.
L:  Probably.
R:  Which I think is cheating [LAUGH].
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN].
L:  Well, I live in Toronto, and um, I don't know if you're following the news or not, but we're sorta like the SARS capital of North America --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, a few weeks, a couple of weeks ago when SARS broke out, nobody  went to restaurants --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because they were afraid of um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- getting SARS, but it was really good for those who did go to a restaurant --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah [LAUGH], there was no line up -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um, no line ups and the parking lots were very empty, so --
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you like to eat out often?
L:  [MN] I enjoy eating out and um, I'd like to eat out at often as I can.
R:  [LAUGH] Are you married?
L:  Ah, no, I'm not.
R:  Oh, well then that's a good reason for not cooking at home.
L:  Right, but I find, um, the nice thing about going out to eat is like, usually there's too much food so I -- I bring back a doggy bag so that lasts me like one or two meals after that, so --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's smart.
L:  -- one fresh meal and two leftover meals to go.
R:  I call leftovers run, reruns.
L:  Okay, that sounds good, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] People say they don't like to eat leftovers and I say, "Well I never have leftovers, I have reruns" [LAUGH].
L:  Well that's true, you watch reruns on TV so what's wrong with --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, for sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, there are only two of us at home anymore, so, um, usually when I do cook I cook enough for two meals, so then later on, you know, I will have the same thing again.
L:  The following day, or just --
R:  No, no, maybe two or three days later.
L:  Do you freeze it first, or just leave it in the fridge?
R:  No, just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just leave it in the refrigerator [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] Mm, but I do a lot of canning and um, I do freeze corn and --
L:  Really?
R:  -- things like that, uh-huh.
L:  Do you take the corn, um, out of the um -- do you freeze it on the cob or --
R:  No, I've tried that and it never worked very well.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I, ah, cut it off --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it, it -- well, you know, when you cook it then, it, it just tastes like fresh corn.
L:  Really?
R:  All my grandchildren love it.
L:  Oh, excellent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it also takes up less space in your freezer if you, ah, take the cobs out.
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I've tried it on the cob and it always tasted either like the cob or it was, ah, I don't know, it didn't have a good taste, I didn't think.
L:  Oh really.
R:  Mm.  And I've never found a good way to freeze beans either -- green beans.
L:  They taste a little of you know -- well, even when you buy frozen beans they don't taste so hot.
R:  Well, they taste better than the ones I tried to freeze [LAUGH].
L:  Oh really, okay [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] So, I just can mine now.
L:  You can beans?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Mm, I can almost everything -- stewed tomatoes, and beans, and um, beets -- I have all those things, ah, up in the garden now -- and I just planted some potatoes today --
L:  Oh really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh. Um -- what do you do with rhubarb?
R:  Ah, well, I have a lot of rhubarb, but, um, my husband doesn't like it -- I'm the only one who likes rhubarb pie.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, one pie'll do me -- you know I only like one piece --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I usually give the rest away.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I d- -- you know -- [MN] for spring that rhubarb is supposed to be it [LAUGH].
L:  Exactly.
R:  Ooh, but when I was a kid we used to take ah, we'd get a handful of sugar --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we'd pull rhubarb up and -- we didn't wash it, we just, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we just dip it in that sugar and eat it [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it was good then, but I wouldn't want to eat it like that now.
L:  For sure, yeah.
R:  But, ah, um, this is kind of a neat program, isn't it?
L:  Right, is this the first time you've tried it?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Well, when I first signed up for it, I w-, I got a couple of calls and I couldn't understand the -- the -- young lady, what she was saying --
L:  Exactly, right.
R:  I thought she was saying like, "Fisher Price" --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and so, anyway, I would just hang up then.
L:  Right, how many, ah, conversations have you had so far?
R:  This is the first one.
L:  Oh, okay, okay, uh-huh.
R:  And I got someone from Canada?
L:  Yes, you do.
R:  -- okay and I've from near Ackren[?], Ohio.
L:  Oh neat, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yeah, this is --
L:  So, is it ten thirty your time, or is a little bit earlier or later?
R:  Mm --
L:  Or is it nine thirty or ten thirty? 
R:  No, it's about ten thirty, mhm.
L:  Okay, yeah okay.
R:  Are we on the same time?
L:  Yeah we are at the same time, yep.
R:  Oh.
L:  And probably after I hang up with you I'll go to the kitchen and get some snackies because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- since we talked about food, ah, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it kinda makes you hungry [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's right.
R:  I like ice cream, I eat ice cream before I go to bed at night.
L:  Oh really?  
R:  And --
L:  That could be dangerous.
R:  Oh, I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  It could stick to your ribs.
R:  But I'm at this -- I'm at the age now, well, my doctor was afraid I was going to have high cholesterol --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I don't.
L:  Oh excellent.
R:  'Cause I just had, ah, blood tests --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was low.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I said, "Well, I guess I can keep on eating ice cream" [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  And he said, "Well, for now".
L:  Okay.  What's your favorite flavor?
R:  Oh, I don't know -- I like um, I like almost every kind -- but I don't like cherry.
L:  You do or you do not?
R:  I don't.
L:  Oh, okay, fair enough.
R:  I like um, caramel, praline pecan --
L:  Mm, that sounds good.
R:  -- I like chocolate marshmallow [MN], vanilla with lots of fudge topping --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- homemade fudge topping, with peanut butter in it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um -- I'll eat almost anything [LAUGH].  My husband says one of these days I'm going to get big as a house.
L:  I guess so, but if you have not so far, I guess --
R:  I haven't.
L:  Well, hey --
R:  And I'm already seventy two, so --
L:  Oh, you have a very young sounding voice for seventy two actually.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I keep busy and I -- I think maybe I will -- if I keep myself busy and my mind active -- I've been using the computer --
L:  Oh, excellent, uh-huh.
R:  -- and um, at first I thought I was too old to try using the computer, but then I decided no, no I'm not [LAUGH], so I've been having fun with that -- do you have one?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Mm -- you probably use one at work.
L:  Ah, yeah and actually I'm using one right as I'm talking to you, too [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, well, now see I've got a one track mind, I couldn't do that.
L:  Well, I'm not very successful at what I'm doing [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's hard to multitask at the same time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but it's interesting chatting with you and um, so, um -- do you -- what kind of food do you like eating -- do you -- do you like eating Chinese food in a restaurant?
R:  No, I don't like Chinese.
L:  No, uh-huh.
R:  No.
L:  Do you like German food?
R:  [SIGH] I just like plain food, mostly.
L:  Oh, I see ah -- plain American food then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Are there many ethnic restaurants in Akron?
R:  Yeah, there are quite a few.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There are a lot of Chinese, and my husband was a bricklayer, [MN] --
L:  Okay.
R:  So he -- and he used to you know, work on restaurants and things --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and some of them he would go in and he would say, "Oh no, we're never going to eat there", you know, if he was back where the kitchen was --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Ew -- so we got the low down on some of the restaurants [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I think it, it doesn't matter which country, like, if you knew what really went on you would  -- [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's right, because I don't think they are as particular as ...
