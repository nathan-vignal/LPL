R:  [LIPSMACK] My name's Tony.
L:  My name is Suzanne.
R:  Hey, how we doing today?
L:  Pretty good.  How are you?
R:  Great.
L:  Good.
R:  So, we've gotta figure out what's worse, huh?
L:  I guess so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Smoking, well, that's pretty bad.  That gives you all kinds of health problems.
L:  No kidding.
R:  Mm.
L:  Or overeating or gossiping is that ...?  [MN] I think I might've missed one or two of 'em, but ...
R:  Oh, overeating, yeah, well, that -- that leads to health problems too.  Gossiping, you know, that just can ruin friendships.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And not exercising, you know, that -- that can lead to problems with obesity and stuff like that, blood pressure.
L:  Right.  I think they're all bad.  It's just they're, you know, bad in so many different ways.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, smoking, you know, you can get emphysema and heart disease and die young.
L:  Exactly.  Whereas gossiping is bad but, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not gonna cause any health problems really, and overeating --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's bad, but you're kind of just ...
R:  Well, not unless somebody gets mad at what you're gossiping and come over and beat ya to death --
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  -- or with a gun -- down here.  Where -- where ya at?
L:  St Louis.
R:  Oh, St Louis.  Well, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And we just had a trial down here about somebody beating somebody to death with a -- well, they didn't beat him to death -- they busted his head open with a baseball bat 'cause they got the wrong idea about things.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow!
R:  So, he just got ten years for it.  Hate crimes.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  They call them hate crimes down here.  They passed a law on that.
L:  What happened to the person that he, uh ...?
R:  Oh, busted his -- busted his skull open.  He got a big old nasty scar on the side of his head.  Got brain -- a little brain damage.
L:  Wow!  Wow!
R:  Yeah.  But that's still not as bad as smoking I guess.
L:  I -- yeah, I -- I definitely agree.  I think smoking is probably one of the worst, um, habits you can probably get and the worst thing about it is it is a habit, whereas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, maybe with gossiping, I mean, sure once you do it it's hard to stop, but whereas smoking it's an addiction, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's harder to stop that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I think the other one is excessive caffeine.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You drink coffee?
L:  No, I don't.  [LAUGH]
R:  You drink tea?
L:  Nope.  Soda.
R:  Soda?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, soda's got caffeine in it, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's not as bad I don't think.
L:  Yeah.  I would think -- from what I understand that would probably be easier to stop --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than smoking because, you know, it's a different type of habit I would imagine.  I -- I've never smoked before.   So, I don't know, but --
R:  Well, good.  Well ...
L:  -- from what I gather it's pretty, you know, addicting obviously.  That's why they call it an ad- addiction and it's very hard to stop.  That's why they have so many programs to help with that I would guess.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they said -- all the medical research not long said caffeine -- you know, some caf- coffee and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it sharpens your memory, you know, and it helps you sleep.  So, you won't get Alzheimer's too early in life and stuff.
L:  Ah.
R:  And something on -- was on the news the other day I was reading.  I'm not a coffee drinker.  I like tea.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And I -- I don't much Cokes, too many Cokes.  I'd rather have some sweet tea, you know?  That's just about as bad for you, the sugar and stuff in it they say.
L:  Yeah.  I've never really had the -- you know, had the taste or acquired the taste for tea.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But a lotta people like it.  So --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- there must be something there.
R:  Yeah.  In the northern states and stuff they don't put no sugar in it.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  In the south here you got -- that's -- sweet tea's the thing, you know, iced sweet tea.  What's the weather like out there?
L:  Um, raining.  We just -- we can't get through this raining season.  [LAUGH]  We're just -- one day after another it's just thunderstorms every day, you know?  It's summer and, you know, we're known for our humidity here but, you know, we've -- so far it's been very mild, very rainy, and very humid.
R:  Well, you know, they're working on the, uh, caf- the nicotine free cigarettes and stuff for people that just like to smoke 'em.
L:  Really?
R:  They -- they oughta be working on smokeless cigarettes too, but I don't see how that can affect anybody.
L:  Are they still addicting?
R:  Well, if it takes caf- the nicotine out of it, it wouldn't be.
L:  Hm.
R:  See, some people they just like to sit there and smoke a cigarette like a cigar or something, you know, pipes, you know, you just -- they smoke it that way.
L:  Right.
R:  And it did help out quite a bit when they put the filter on it and made, uh, those lights and ultra lights and stuff.  You're sucking in more air I think than you are the smoke 'cause they've got holes all along the filter.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But it's still -- still addictive, still bad for ya.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  So, what soda do you drink, like Coke, Pepsi?
L:  Coke, Pepsi, yep.  I just like the normal ones.  I'm not a big diet fan.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't like Sprite or ...
R:  Well, I don't like the taste of 'em myself.
L:  Just soda, just Coke, Pepsi, whatever.
R:  Yeah.  The diets -- I don't like the diets.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, they've got the caffeine free Cokes.
L:  Yeah.  There you go.
R:  Yeah, that's supposed to be health- healthy for you, but still you've got, what, sixteen table- tablespoons of sugar in there --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and sugar -- they say sugar leads to obesity.  It leads to hypertension and everything else.
L:  Mhm.  What about exercising?  Are you big on exercising?
R:  Uh, I do a lot of manual work at -- at work.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  A lot of manual labor at work.  So, I -- I -- I figure that's my exercise and I -- I do a lot of walking.
L:  So, that makes sense.
R:  You know -- well, when I go to the doctor he says I need to -- my body has adjusted to the walking I do, but I need to speed it up a little bit more.
L:  Mm.
R:  Jog a little bit and I don't know about that.  My knees won't handle that I don't think, the pounding on the cement.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you exercise?
L:  Yeah.  Um, I take a kick boxing class and I am involved in dance and I work at a restaurant.  So, I get my walking that way.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, there you go.  There's a lot of walking and moving there.
L:  Yeah.  I think if you really know how many miles you walked in a day it would probably, uh ...
R:  Well, I got one of those meters that tells me.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah.  So, I -- I figure I walk about ten miles a day.
L:  Wow!
R:  See, I got a -- I got a heart dial -- for a square foot warehouse and I walk around it all the time.  Walk around it --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- walk around it three times that's a mile.
L:  Wow!  That's great exercise then.
R:  Yeah.  I'm constantly moving around it.  They're always complaining at work they can't find me because I'm never in one spot long enough to run me down.
L:  [LAUGH] Wow!
R:  I go, "Well, I gotta keep on moving.  Keep moving".
L:  Definitely.
R:  That -- I unload trucks and stuff, you know?  So, that's the strenuous part of it.  Sweat.  Sweat a lot.
L:  Yes.  And I'm surprised you want to exercise after that.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The wife wants me to walk with her at night when I get home and I don't feel like doing that.
L:  Well, that makes sense.
R:  And I tell her to take the dog for a walk, he'll love to walk with ya.
L:  Oh, that's great exercise.  I don't have dogs.  I have cats.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the boy was supposed to come along and get the dog we had because nobody ever pays attention to it.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  We've got a Golden Retriever.  The boy -- my son wanted it.  Now he's got two jobs and he's wrestling.  So, he's getting his exercise that way.
L:  Is the dog a pretty good size then?
R:  It's a -- it'll be three years old on Father's Day.
L:  Wow!
R:  But he's a pretty good size.  He's -- he's a nice one.  He's over friendly I think.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They -- they brought out that decaf coffee.  I don't drink decaf coffee because I want the -- I only drink coffee in the mornings anyway.
L:  No kinda coffee for me at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The taste to it I don't -- you know, it may wake you up, but I don't know if it's worth it.
R:  Well, they got all different kinds of brands of coffee.  Vanilla coffee, you know, and mocha and all that, you know, if you don't like the ...
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Do you like those flavored ones?
R:  No.
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  I drink cream and sugar in my coffee.
L:  Ah.
R:  And I guess I'll stay a coffee drinker.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It helps you keep the weight down I guess.
L:  That's ...
R:  Curbs your appetite.
L:  I've heard that.  I've heard that.
R:  You know, if I quit drinking coffee, you know then I'll probably start putting weight on 'cause I won't be as active, moving around.
L:  Mhm.  And then you like to drink sweet tea?
R:  Yep.  That's more nicotine -- caffeine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  Hey.  If you stop doing what they say is bad for ya I guess ya may as well die 'cause they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- say everything is bad for ya.
L:  Who knows?  They'll come up with something else later anyway that's bad for you.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they said milk was bad for ya.  Now they're kicking on milk -- milk's good for you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They said eggs are bad for ya.  Raise your cholesterol.  Now they say eat more eggs because of the protein and stuff in it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They don't know what to do.
L:  Can't make up their ...
R:  Right.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Then a lotta your veget- vegetables you're eating stuff, you know, they've got chemicals and stuff in it.  So, what are ya going do?
L:  That's right.  Who knows?  All this -- you know, in a couple of years they'll tell ya the opposite anyway so ...
R:  That's right.  Just enjoy life while you can.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  What was the other one?  Let's see.  There's caffeine, nicotine, not working -- I mean, no exercise and gossip.  I think that was about it, wasn't it?
L:  I -- I think so.  I guess that I might've missed some, but I think it was the, uh, exercising and caffeine and I missed one of those.
R:  Yeah.  If you have to gossip about somebody, you know, it could put 'em in a, uh -- I'm trying to think of the word -- depression mood.
L:  There's lots of things bad, but I don't -- I don't know if I'd really say it's a habit as much as it's --
R:  You know, some people ...
L:  -- just kind of an annoying personality trait.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  That's about it, you know?  If they like sticking their noses in somebody else's business they should gossip somewhere else.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  One of these days those people like that is gonna roll over in their sleep and sneeze and blow their brains out.
L:  There you go.  [LAUGH]
R:  Their nose is gonna be so big it's gonna stick in their ear.
