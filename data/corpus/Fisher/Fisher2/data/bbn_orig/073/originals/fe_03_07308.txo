L:  Hi, hi my name is Ruthie.
R:  Hello, my name is Laurie.
L:  [LAUGH] How are ya?
R:  [LAUGH] How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm pretty good [LAUGH].
R:  Okay, I'm good.
L:  So, ah, so ah, what do you think about ah, eating in a restaurant?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I love to eat in a restaurant, I'd rather eat in a restaurant than cook at home [SIGH].
L:  How come?
R:  I don't know, I just do.  What about you?
L:  'Cause it takes a lot less preparation [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] I guess so.
L:  Somebody's cleaning up after you?
R:  Um, I usually have to do the cleaning up.
L:  Yeah, see there you go, that's why you prefer to eat in a restaurant [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  And it's funny, everything always seems to taste better when ah, someone else has cooked it.
R:  Sure.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, it's so good.  What's your favorite restaurant?
R:  Um, well we kind of like Ruby Tuesdays the best.
L:  That's a good one.
R:  Yeah --
L:  It's really good.
R:  -- what's your favorite restaurant?
L:  [SIGH] Oh gosh, um, there's a place called, it's called the Cosmic Cantina, it's very local, um, I live in North Carolina, so, um, it's --
R:  Well I live in North Carolina.
L:  You do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  We live in Elizabeth Town.
L:  Oh, I live in Rawleigh[?].
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, well we live --
L:  I'm living in --
R:  -- in Elizabeth Town, that's not far from White Lake --
L:  -- that's crazy, no.  Yeah, oh yeah I know where Elizabeth Town is.  Um, I'm living in Chapel Hill this summer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um, there's this restaurant called Cosmic Cantina and they serve like, this really, really good Mexican food that's really, really cheap, you get like three dollars for this burrito the size of your head --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- guacamole and sour cream and mm, it's really good [LAUGH]
R:  Mm, I like stuff like that.  I like Mexican food and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- places like that, but right here in Elizabeth Town we don't have a lot of -- we just don't have a lot of places to eat --
L:  I'm willing to bet, yeah [LAUGH]
R:  -- so we have to travel out of town to find something to eat, so I guess Lumberton[?] is our closest place -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my son is twelve and his favorite places to eat, one of them is Ruby Tuesdays, so ...
L:  Oh, it's so good.   They have a lot of good -- what's your favorite thing to get?
R:  Um, I don't really have a favorite, not there.  I like it all.  I think --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I had to choose ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I had to choose one --  
L:  [LAUGH] I'd like one of everything.
R:  [LAUGH]  -- yeah, if I had to choose something, I guess it would be um, the um, um, pasta alfredo --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and shrimp, mhm.
L:  Mhm, really good.
R:  Yeah, that's my favorite.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we're not really big, um, meat eaters --
L:  No?
R:  -- if we eat meat it's usually chicken --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, that --
L:  I'm a vegetarian myself.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  But, I'm the kind of person where I can find something on any menu [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well that's me too, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I usually find anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but we like, my son likes Japanese food too, and --
L:  Mm, do you have a Konki[?]?
R:  Ah, yeah, yeah --
L:  Ooh.
R:  No, we don't have a Konki, but I, it's the Kyoto's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- down in this area and it's basically the same thing.
L:  The same thing, oh it's so good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is it the kind of place where they like do the whole big food show --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in front of you?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they put -- they cook it all right there in front of you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and toss it to you [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's always really fun --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I feel -- I always feel nervous for them like they're going to mess up or something [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um [LAUGH].
R:  Well, we -- and we're like, you know, we're junk food junkies too --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, my son is diabetic so we, you know, have to kinda lay low --
L:  Definitely yeah.
R:  -- on the hamburgers and things like that, so --
L:  That definitely cuts down on the ah junk food in the house.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so we don't do you know much of that and we --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- grill out too, we grill here at the house --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- when we do cook here at home, a lot of the times we grill, so --
L:  Mhm, what's your favorite thing [several inaudible words] for your family?
R:  Um -- 
L:  Or, do you like to cook?
R:  I do, I love to cook, um, but when I work I don't have a lot of time, I'm --
L:  I hear you.
R:  I'm a teacher, so, um --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and we pastor a church, so we're very involved in all that so we don't really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't have a lot of time to cook.  I do like to try different things --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, new recipes and just try all kinds of stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, but, you know --
L:  Really good.
R:  Yeah, you know, and my son is, he -- he's not really that much of a picky eater --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- you can kinda give him most anything and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's some things that he don't like, but um --
L:  [LAUGH] Like what?
R:  -- [SIGH] um --
L:  How old  -- you said he's twelve?
R:  Ahah, he's twelve, but he's good --
L:  So, he probably doesn't like vegetables very much.
R:  Well no, he does.  He loves veget-- --
L:  Oh he does?
R:  Yeah, for a twelve year old, you'd be surprised.
L:  That's awesome, no kidding.
R:  He loves vegetables and we have a garden, my husband has a garden.  We have --
L:  Mm, I love fresh grown vegetables.
R: Yeah, we have fresh vegetables, and he --
L:  Especially tomatoes.
R:  -- he don't like tomatoes, and I think that's --
L:  He doesn't like -- 
R:  -- one thing that he despises [LAUGH], so --
L:  Ah, fresh grown tomatoes are so good, though.
R:  Yeah, but he loves cabbage, 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he loves squash and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and cucumbers, and in fact we had some cucumbers for supper and --
L:  Mm, yum.
R:  -- um but he, like I say, he loves cab--, and, and collards, he lo-- --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh he's from the South, I mean --
R:  Yeah, he's from South [LAUGH].
L:  You've gotta love collards if you're, yeah, if you're in the South.
R:  Yeah, he loves collards but you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I guess if I have to cook something, if, if, my favorite would be the fresh stuff for my family.
L:  I love, yeah.  It's oh, it's so good.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, anyway, what's your favorite restaurant?  
L:  What's my favorite restaurant?
R:  Beside the one you had mentioned before?
L:  Besides that one, I really like, um, I re- -- do you have any Oh Charlies? 
R:  [MN] Um, yeah, I think there's one in Wilmington.
L:  Yeah, I think there is actually one in Wilmington --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think I've been there.  Um, they have really, really good buttery rolls, they're so good --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And they have about thirty grams of fat per roll, but I don't care, they're so good and um, yeah so they have -- and they have really amazing chocolate cake [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I just order a couple of side dishes and have um, like some big old rolls and some chocolate cake -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But yeah, I love to eat out, it's just, it -- it feels like such a treat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, yeah, well now we --
L:  You just feel like you're treating yourself.
R:  -- I guess you know if -- if I had out of the seven days in a week we do eat out more often than we do -- than we cook at home.
L:  Yeah, --
R:  You know --
L:  -- I mean, especially since you work.
R:  I mean we always have breakfast -- yeah, you know we always have breakfast at home 'cause that we're just --
L:  Together?
R:  -- um, [MN], no, not really, I don't cook breakfast, there's usually just a bowl
L:  Right.
L:  -- of cereal or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a pop tart and then lunch, but -- ah -- all of our meals we, we usually try to stay together, yeah, um.
L:  That's really nice --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- it's -- do you have just the one son?
R:  Ahah, he's just our --
L:  'Cause that's pretty -- 
R:  -- only son, and --
L:  -- that's pretty easy to eat together, then.
R:  Yeah, it is, and my husband is retired on disability, he has cancer --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so, um
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we -- you know, we ah usually try to do everything together, so --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- we're getting ready to take a trip to New York so I'm really excited about --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  -- finding the restaurants there [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Cool.
R:  Trying those out [LAUGH].
L:  No kidding, what are you going to New York for?
R:  Um, my husband has to go for some cancer treatment --
L:  Mm okay.
R:  -- and he'll be at Sloane Cattering[?] um Hospital there in Manhattan and it's our first trip, but everybody's already telling him, "Well, you've got to eat at Sorties[?] and you've got to eat" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "here and you've got to eat there", so --
L:  That's so funny [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] New York by restaurants.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That's awesome [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, so that's -- you know, we're getting excited about it and, and hoping you know we can find all these different places to eat --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- 'cause we do love to eat, so --
L:  Yeah, well, well sure [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, if you like a lot of different types of places, you're going to love New York, 'cause man, you can get anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Well, that's what they tell us --
L:  So good.
R:  -- and, and where our hotel is going to be I think um from what I -- I went to the travel agent today and she tell me we had you know, lots of different places to choose from to eat and, and all that stuff --
L:  Awesome.
R:  -- you know, I mean, just the diversity of all kinds of different cuisines --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you know, we're gonna have to try all --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- try everything we can try --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- while we're there, so.
L:  [LAUGH] Since your son is diabetic, has that like cut back on what you can eat in the house, or --
R:  Not really, um, he's on an insulin pump now, so he --
L:  Oh, he's on a pump?
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he's only had that two weeks, so --
L:  Oh wow, how's that working out -- is it ok--?
R:  It's working out really good, 'cause we're learning to count the carbohydrates --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- so he can really eat what he wants, I mean, he can't sit down and, and indulge in a box of crispy cream donuts --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- but, you know, he can eat whatever he wants within reason --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and, and we're learning that you know, he has to give himself enough insulin to cover the meal that he's eating --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whether it be here at home or in a restaurant.  Now, before he went on the pump he was taking the injections --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and it was a little bit different with that.  He had to be real careful what he ate, you know.
L:  Especially since he's twelve, I mean it's --
R:  Yeah, yeah, and, and, he --
L:  So, he's type one?
R:  He's type one diabetes, yes.
L:  Type one yeah.
R:  Yeah, he's insulin dependent, and um --
L:  That's so tough.
R:  Yeah, it is, but he's handled it very well and, you know, and we're all learning to eat like he eats --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know.
L:  That whole support system thing.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, and I've learned to cook different ways and, and things that he can have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, you know I thought we were going to be real limited on eating out, but we're not, we can go --
L:  That's really g-- --
R:  [MN]
L:  So what kind of stuff does he eat when he goes out?  D- does he just have to count his carbs?
R:  Yeah, he counts his carbs, but it, it also depends on what his blood sugar level is at that time.
L:  Right. 
R:  And, you know, if it's at a pretty decent level, if it's below two hundred he can just bolus[?] himself enough insulin to cover the meal and really get what he wants.
L:  Right. 
R:  So that's then, you know --
L:  That's really, really nice --
R:  Yeah, it really is, 'cause we were really intimidated about it to start with, we were kind of afraid that okay we're going to have to eat all of our meals at home, no more eating out --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- but it, it turned out not to be that way, so ...
L:  When was he diagnosed, then?
R:  He was diagnosed just this past March second.
L:  Oh my gosh --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, he's new
