R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Mike.
R:  Hi, it's Jennifer.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  Is this your first time using this?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Neither one of us know what we're doing.  I guess we're supposed to answer that -- what did she say the topic was? [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, what do you think is worse, and some of the issues were drinking, um, gossiping, um, not exercising --
R:  Oh, I can't really. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
L:  I know, the hardest thing for me is not exercising.  However, I think that, um, probably drinking would be worse because you're affecting other people if you drive.
R:  Yeah, I mean, drinking and driving is one thing, drinking in general --
L:  Isn't necessarily a bad thing --
R:  -- did they say -- ex- -- I think they said excessively.
L:  Excessively.
R:  I think anything in excess, and exercise is not going to be good for you --
L:  Not a good thing [LAUGH] 
R:  -- even exercising [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I think too, even with exercising and everything, so they'll just start it and then they don't, or they try doing too much right away.
R:  Mhm.  I know I do.  I go, like, ten months without doing it and then -- and then think I can just jump right back into it.  It doesn't work like that.
L:  Yeah, and I tell myself it's my -- it's my New Year's resolution every year, that I'm going to start exercising and it never happens. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, not to worry, whatever. [LAUGH] It's over rated, I think.  I did it for years and years and years --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but that's okay.  I don't think, um, necessarily -- what was it?  I think gossiping is pretty upsetting --
L:  Yeah, because -- and then you get false rumors is what leads out of it and --
R:  It's just -- for the most part I think it's just annoying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if nothing else it's just annoying, it's bad karma.  All around, not a very nice thing to do.  But, ah, what was the other one?  Caffeine?
L:  Caffeine [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- well, considering I had to take a caffeine pill just to get going this morning because I don't drink coffee [LAUGH] honestly[?], that's okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  I have to admit I have coffee, but I flavor it because I don't like it straight or [LAUGH] I have to add some of the sugar and everything else in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But actually, I heard that eating an apple gives you more energy than drinking a cup of coffee, which surprised me.
R:  That's because there's so much damn sugar in apples.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  There's so much sugar in -- in so many fresh fruits that, I mean, I've only learned that because I used to wonder why, you know, I'm eating really healthy, why am I crashing all the time?  Why am I getting so tired?  You know, later in the afternoon even though I eat fruits and stuff for breakfast and it's because the sugar in it.
L:  Hm, okay.
R:  Natural sugar, no good.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Where are you from?  Where am I --
L:  Actually I'm from Appleton, Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, really?  Is that where I'm talking to you right now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in Boston.
L:  Boston --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- okay.  I don't travel a whole lot, I think it was, like, Mexico, Accapulco, um, Texaco, that area, like, fifteen years ago and then last year I finally made a trip to Las Vegas. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yeah.  Talk about excess. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] That is the capital of excess drinking, caffeine, gossip and everything else I think they mentioned.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R: But, ah, it's a good time there.  I've been to Vegas a couple of times.  I've always had a good time.
L:  So what's Boston like personality wise to excess drinking?  Same thing, like any place else or [LAUGH] 
R:  No, it's a little bit, I mean, there's so many colleges here --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that, you know, the excess drinking is always a big problem, but very few people in Boston have a car so it's just a matter of them getting rowdy and annoying rather than drinking and driving.  I mean, I'm sure that, you know, it's still a problem as it is anywhere, but it's, you know, they take the train and just, you see people throwing up on the train and on the subway systems and stuff and it's pretty disgusting when, you know, people drink in excess.  But, and I personally, I work in a lot of bars doing, um, promotions stuff --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm always -- and I promote liquor, is one of the jobs I do, um, some scotch and some, like, you know, wines and stuff like that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so I'm very aware of when people are drinking excessively and when they're just, you know, being mellow and there is a huge difference in their personality and everything.
L:  Yeah, and see if -- I -- before I moved to the Appleton area, if I was going, I never went out to drink or anything socially, and I occasionally go out now but I usually tend to go earlier because, like, a friend of mine owns his own business and he doesn't want to, um, worry about drinking and driving, getting picked up, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the insurance rates --
R:  Oh god yes! [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] and um, so it's like, "Oh you can have another drink", he goes to me, and it's like, "No, no, no", because one time for New Year's, I went out and once in a life time [LAUGH] you know, after and you get sick off of it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like, no, that's -- that's not very funny, I don't see why people like drinking excessively. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I usually -- I go a couple of months where I don't drink at all and then I'll go out with friends or something and I always find myself -- and I'll drink and then, because it takes so long to catch up with you, you know, if -- if everyone's doing shots or something you think, oh, I'm not even drunk, I'm not -- not feeling anything, and so you have another drink and before you know it, it all hits you at once.
L:  Exactly --
R:  And I always end up way drunker than I wanted to be --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I mean, I'm always saying, "Thank god I didn't drive down here", and usually end up taking a cab or something, but I'm always kicking myself in the ass the next day going "Oh my god", you know?  Why bother?  I lost an en- -- I lose an entire day of activities because of a hangover, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] One time I had this drink called the dirty snowball.  I don't know if they make it in other places or if that's something unique to this --
R:  I have never heard of it [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's basically a -- a huge glass like -- like soda sized glass of -- it's like a -- it's almost like a ice cream malt type liquor drink, and there's, like, I think, like, four or five liquors in there [LAUGH] 
R:  Ooh, you don't want to mix too many. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and it tasted like -- it tasted like ice cream and one day it was, like, hot out and friends said, "Oh try some", I'm like, "Well that's good", and I think I had like, three or four of 'em [LAUGH] and it's like, all those folks talk about hitting you later then it's like, ooh.
R:  Yeah.  When it hits, it hits hard if you're not watching. [LAUGH] And no matter what, you can always go a couple of months you still go back out and think, hey, I'm having a good time.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And the same thing happens.
L:  Yeah.  And gossip, like you said, too, I think it's pretty high up there because, like I said, you're playing with people's emotions or false rumors and stuff.
R:  And it's just really not classy. [LAUGH] It's a stupid thing to do, it's so --
L:  Childish, kind of.
R:  -- it's so very high school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What were the other things that the, ah, recording said?  They said gossip, caffeine, alcohol, exercise.
L:  Yeah, I think kinda, caffeine and exercise are kinda -- kinda are a health habit thing, I suppose drinking though could be too, if it's excessively, but caffeine, I don't think I worry about too much because [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, and it's not something, well I guess it could kill you, but it's not something that's going to really harm too many people.
L:  And as far as, like, exercise, it's everybody's personal preference and some people do have weight problems but it is how you eat, how much energy you try burning off doing activities and stuff, too.  So I think those are kind of controllable factors there too.  I guess they've never bothered me and if somebody is overweight, um, that doesn't mean their personality isn't ba -- is -- is bad or isn't bad.  Um, it's something they have to almost deal with, I guess.  I don't -- I don't worry about it so much, I guess.
R:  Oh no, the person always worries more.  I -- I think people always worry more about --
L:  Their image.
R:  -- their own -- what other people think of them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's always worse than what people actually think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, people are just really hard on themselves and we're just conditioned to be like that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  with all the --
L:  American Idol, the perfect looking --
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I was watching VH one this morning and it was um, an episode on rock bodies and rock stars and how all these outrageous things people are doing to keep themselves -- or get themselves in shape or, you know, having their -- their stomach tied or shrunken and all this stuff and waxing, and unbelievable measures people go through and the unbelievable amount of money people spend, you know, it's not just exercising that's excessive, it's the entire process and everything that goes along with trying to look idealistic, in their eyes, I guess.  It's ridiculous.  [LAUGH] I think people spend way too much time and way too much money worrying about how they look and it should just be, you know, a health issue.  If you're healthy and an average -- it should be okay, and there's such a high premium put on being a hundred pounds or something ridiculously --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- unhealthy.
L:  Exactly.  I guess I've been fortunate because I'm like, six foot five, and only like, one hundred and seventy some pounds so I'm tall and thin [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I actually I think I get a lot of exercise just in the things I do normally that I don't really consider exercise --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's just that I'm that active, and actually do eat overall, pretty healthy.  Not that salads are always healthy because you load all the good stuff, the dressings --
R:  Cheese [LAUGH] 
L:  -- cheese, yeah that's a big thing, especially coming from Was- --Wisconsin --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
L:  -- amongst the cheese heads. [LAUGH] But, um, so, and I think too, working on the hidden factor in there would be excess and everything, and like, with guys we just say, "Oh we're not going to live forever anyhow".  And we pig out on all this stuff, the beer, the [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the drinks, the -- the food. [LAUGH] But --
R:  Yeah.  I have, um, a friend who goes -- she goes -- she goes to the gym obsessively and, you know, there's -- I used to go to the gym but I would go when I had time, it wasn't, you know, like, I had to be there every single day for one point five hours or anything like that and I had to do these certain things or I wouldn't go out, you know, and that's the way she does it, and I just -- it interferes with our plans, like, I'm -- I'll ask do you want to go hang out
