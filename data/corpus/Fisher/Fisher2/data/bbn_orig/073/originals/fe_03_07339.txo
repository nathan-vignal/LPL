L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi, how are you, my name's Nicole.
L:  Hi, I'm Jane, how are you?
R:  Fine, thanks.
L:  [LAUGH] So, I guess we're supposed to talk about illness, when the seasons change --
R:  Yeah, have -- have you, have you done this before?
L:  No.
R:  Okay, yeah, that's what we're supposed to discuss.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, do you want to go first, or do you want me to start?
L:  Um, sure, um, I don't really get ill when the seasons change, um, I don't -- I guess I'm lucky that I don't have allergies, I think sometimes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that happens but, for me, um, I just kind of believe that it's just your exposure to the bugs, or you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to whatever little microbes are out there and your resistance to them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- that's -- I don't really like, get nervous when the seasons change about getting you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, one thing I do do is when I start to feel like a scratchy throat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I take mega doses of vitamin C --
R:  Really?
L:  -- um, yeah, but I don't, um -- I don't take it otherwise, I -- you know, I only take -- I take like five thousand milligrams if I start to feel an itch in my throat --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I can make it go away that way.
R:  Good for you -- you're lucky.
L:  But, I have to catch it right away, like, if I -- if I'm teaching and I feel it like first period and I wait 'til the end of the day I'm doomed, you know [LAUGH] -- but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, so I keep a lot --
R:  So, you're a teacher?
L:  Um, yeah, I'm on hiatus now, 'cause I had a, a baby, but yeah I -- [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Did you find yourself more susceptible to illness when you have like kid- -- what, what year do you teach?  What grade?
L:  Um, I've taught all grades -- pretty much from elementary school up through um, high school --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- yes, I definitely do, so I --
R:  Really.
L:  -- I used to be a big fan of hand sanitizers and Lysol.
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  And I would Lysol my doorknob like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was getting a little obsessive, I'd like do it between every period and you, you know like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in the winter months and stuff, um, and another thing -- I would make my high school kids do, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and even my elementary school kids is like -- we, we wiped our desks off, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- once a week, you know [LAUGH] -- I -- I figure --
R:  Well, yeah, I -- you don't think about --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- how much like germs, you know, I -- I'm in, I'm just graduated college and you don't really think about it until you actually get sick, about how much you know -- well, who was sitting in this desk before me and you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what did they do on it, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Especially with little kids when they're all snotty nosed --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and some of them are too little -- you're just like --
R:  And they don't even know, yeah.
L:  -- "Okay, take the far end of the Kleenex box", yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Well, you know for me, I actually dread the season change because I have extremely bad allergies --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- so it will be, you know, like -- ac- actually right now it's terrible, my eyes have been puffy for like three weeks.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  So, yeah, I mean it's -- it's not, you know, it's something that I've had for twenty two years, so I -- I know how to work through it and I know where I can and cannot be, but this year it seems like it's actually a little bit worse -- I -- I literally like have to have fans in my room because I can't even open my windows [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  There must be like so many pores in the ah, air -- [inaudible].
L:  Oh, you can see them flying -- my car is coated --
R:  Yeah, you know --
L:  -- I -- I can imagine if I had allergies -- ooh.
R:  Yeah, but see the thing is, I don't consider that really being sick, and I guess it's because it happens to me four times a year --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, so I consider like the flu you know, or something where I'm actually like, bedridden, to be like an illness and -- you know, my doctor always says to me, "You've gotta relax", you know, "Even you don't feel like -- you, you still feel like you can do things, you really can't", so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's hard though.
L:  Yeah, I had an allergy attack one time, when I was like in high school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was working as a cashier at a Win Dixie and I looked -- and it was just on one side of my head, like just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like my left side exploded, you know, like puffy -- I could, I could barely see out of the eye and it was just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- all puffed -- they sent me home, I think I was scaring the customers away, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're like, "Please go home", and I'm like, "But --"
R:  [LAUGH] Please.
L:  "-- except for my, wanting -- me wanting to itch my eyeball, I'm, I'm okay", [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, still -- oh I can't imagine --
R:  How -- how old is -- how old is your baby?
L:  Um she's -- well, she's not that much of a baby now, she's actually um, going to turn three --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so I am actually going back to teaching this September, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh good, now has -- has -- have you noticed any like illnesses with her, or ...?
L:  No, knock wood --
R:  [inaudible] Really?
L:  I've been so extremely lucky, um --
R:  Good for you.
L:  -- and if anything, because my husband is highly allergic I thought that my baby would get it --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- but my older daughter actually gets it -- oh, she's starting to get it. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she never had it before -- just this year she was like, "Mommy, my eyes are itchy" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and I'm like "Oh oh, that could be your Daddy coming out in you", you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so ...
R:  I think that, you know, you shouldn't worry too much because this year, even, um, I live with ten people, I have ten roommates and --
L:  Holy moly.
R:  -- everyone here was like -- yeah, they're -- I'm up at Penn State and there are views on that, well um, they said that they haven't had allergies and this year, this like -- this like last month has been really, really rough on them -- you should hear us in the morning, everyone's sneezing [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  You know, we sound like a sick house, but it -- it's just [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, well I had a friend who never had allergies until she was about thirty --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and moved down to Atlanta and then suddenly --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- she was extremely allergic to everything [LAUGH], so ...
R:  Wow, that's really strange -- I guess it really --
L:  Yeah, 'cause she'd lived in New York, I mean she'd lived in Manhattan which is not exactly like a -- you know --
R:  Oh yeah, like a quarantined area.
L:  -- [LAUGH] exactly -- never had 'em, moved down to Atlanta and it was -- and has had 'em ever since.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, so yeah, I guess it really has to do with the just the air in certain places, and stuff like that.
L:   Right, right, yeah.
R:  But, what are you gonna do?  I guess you have to fight it off.  Yeah, I really should ch- do the vitamin C thing, my mom always tells me to do that and, and she swears by it as well.  I never -- I know that this sounds silly but I don't think I ever get to it on time.  You know like you -- you --
L:  Yeah, no, you ah -- you -- go ahead [LAUGH].
R:  -- well you -- you said that -- you said, well you said that you did it right as you feel the scratch --
L:  D- --
R:  -- I probably wait until the scratch becomes like a hacking cough, you know -- and then --
L:  Oh no, no -- too late then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then [inaudible] -- you just gotta let it -- but yeah, and I -- it's just like -- I feel like that itch like right, like, almost in like the Eustachian tube, like, in the back of your throat ear area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's when I have to get it -- like I can't, I can't even wait 'til like midday, like if I have something in my car, I have to like immediately --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm sure a lot of it is psychological or whatever --
R:  Yeah, but hey, whatever makes you feel better right?
L:  Exactly, and, and, but I mean literally it's gone away and it didn't, you know -- and, the -- and it didn't turn into a full blown cold --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- and when it didn't do it, it did, you know, I could feel it progressing so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well also, well that's the same thing as with the children and you know, you've got two of them -- I'm sure they bring home 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all kinds of stuff -- you were just saying with you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the kids that you teach, you have be careful of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but the same with -- my mom has four kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she said that she never got sick until we came into the picture [LAUGH].  
L:  Right, right.
R:  And we started going to school, because it would just be like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- literally passing it from one toy to the next, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and I have friends with two kids and like the younger one has never been sick like an infant and the older one goes off to nursery school and then suddenly everybody is, you know --
R:  Uh-huh, the whole house.
L:  -- got cold after cold, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  It just goes through the whole house, that's funny.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  And it's hard, once it -- well there, there were four of us 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in our family and then my two parents, so if it goes to one and then you know, travels to everyone, it takes like a month to get through everyone --
L:  It does --
R:  -- so you're like --
L:  -- and sometimes some people get it twice, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- yeah, and you're like, you know, my mom's like, "I'm incapacitated for a month, I've got ...", you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's like, it's so hard to like, get back on after that.
L:  [NOISE].
R:  That must be hard.
L:  Yeah, yeah. 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Um, luckily -- I just, I haven't had too much of an issue with that, I mean, I don't know if it's genes or whatever, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thank god, [NOISE] because some of my friends are always sick and I just feel so bad for them [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, well like I said, I mean, I'm lucky enough to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at le- -- I -- I consider myself lucky, although I do get the allergy thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at least it's not like vomiting, or like stomach pain, or like anything like that you know.
L:  Oh, I can't even -- I can't deal with that, no.
R:  Because that is just -- that is terrible, I mean, I -- I know a lot of people that like frequently have stomach, stomach aches and I'm like, "Oh my gosh, how do you even ...", I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I wouldn't even be able to get up in the morning [LAUGH].
L:  I can't do that.  You know, it's so funny because it's like gosh, you know, I could be -- you know it would be so cool to be like a bulimic you know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- except I just can't stand vomiting [LAUGH] -- I can't do it [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, so then I could eat whatever I wanted [LAUGH]
R:  I know right, yeah there's just that -- there's just that little small part of getting sick that we can't do, right?
L:  Yeah, no can do -- ugh.
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny, that's really funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  What else were we --
R:  -- I -- I think that something else they mentioned in the question was that, there's a saying that you get rid of a cold in seven days --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if you go to a doctor, and it goes a- -- I -- I don't know if I agree with that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I personally am a fan of prescription medicine.
L:  Ahah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I am not -- it could completely be all psychological but there is something that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really does it for me when I take a pill --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or when I start like a cough syrup.
L:  I think that you can feel better when you go to a doctor because maybe it like alleviates your symptoms --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know if it helps the -- the actual virus -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to leave any quicker -- that's why like a lot of doctors are like you know,  [NOISE] "I can't prescribe antibiotics for you, because what you have is --"
R:  Is viral.
L:  "--viral", you know what I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and a lot of people end up like pushing the doctor to do it and then you know, and then you know, and then -- some -- we're getting some super germs out there because you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're just taking these antibiotics that --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- for no reason, but um, but I think that you do -- I mean, I think some of what the doctors prescribe is just more to make you like, "Let me relieve that sore throat" --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- or "Let me relieve your congestion", not necessarily --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what's causing it but, you know --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I agree.
L:  Right, but then on the, on the converse side, I have some friends who will not go a doctor because they feel like if you relieve the symptom [NOISE] you delay getting better, and I don't agree with that either, you know -- 
R:  Really, I've never heard that.
L:  -- why suffer? -- why [LAUGH] -- life is too short --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm too busy [NOISE] to just be like, "I'm ...", you know, "I'm achy, I'm dying, I can't do anything", you know [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, that's, god, god bless --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- them, because that's really hard to do [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and it's not even -- it's not true [NOISE], you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the symptoms are not what makes the antibodies --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- produce themselves, you know, tha- that's the white blood cells and the symptoms are just [NOISE] the symptom of that, it doesn't -- you know it's not backwards --
R:  It doesn't -- mhm. 
L:  -- like if you stop the symptoms you stop the white blood cells, [NOISE] so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you know, but everyone is going to believe what they're going to believe and you [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  -- you could -- what can you do?
R:  Yeah, I -- I personally am all about, you know, getting rid of the congestion, and getting rid of the small stuff -- I'm not a super -- I -- I don't know how I feel about over the counter, nothing really over the counter tends to work for me --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- and maybe it's just because of the allergies that I have and just -- I really just have to ride out the change of seasons and this --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- for me, I'm in Pennsylvania, central Pennsylvania --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's been just a rough change of seasons --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's been really rainy and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, you were said -- you can even see the pores in the air --
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  -- so like, I -- I [inaudible] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I find that like nothing really that I ...
