L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  How you doing today?
L:  I'm good.  And yourself?
R:  Good.
L:  Good.
R:  Good. It's pretty -- it's changed from -- it's gonna change from when it's spring [MN] summer.  Hope I don't catch a cold. How 'bout you?  My name's Ed.
L:  Ed, I'm Joy.
R:  Joy, how you doing?
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know about you, but when I catch a cold it's usually for, you know, the old seven days --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- seven -- seven to ten days.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  A long time.
R:  Yeah.  My grandmother usually had an [MN] old, ah, adage for it.  She used to give you the old chicken soup and whatnot for it.
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  Usually lay down in bed.  And then seven to ten days later it used to be gone, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Seven to ten days?  That's a long time.
R:  Well, you know, before it was, you know, the old runny noses and it runs its course and whatnot, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.  That's what it -- how it always begins, you know, like, with the runny nose.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Then, like, you get those body chills.
R:  Oh, that -- that's usually the best part of it, ain't it?
L:  [LAUGH] The best part?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you don't -- you know you got a cold when you get the body chills.
L:  Oh yeah.  Oh.
R:  My Lord, you're running around and all of a sudden [MN].
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know it's not a cold until you start shaking. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I agree.  And then I discovered the beauty of Nyquil.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, the bet part of Nyquil is you just lay down with stuff afterwards and you're gone for the rest of the night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.  But see, that's the thing.  Like, I always thought you would catch cold in the winter season, but I didn't catch one at all in Boston this whole, [MN] like, winter.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And it was one of the +worst, coldest winters.  And now I just got it too.
R:  I'll tell you something.  Some of my worst colds have been during the summer.
L:  Really?
R:  So [MN] --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Buffalo.
L:  Oh, you're in Buffalo right now?
R:  Yeah, Buffalo, New York.  Ah, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, my worst ones have been in, like, ah, summer going into fall, or, ah, spring coming into summer.
L:  Really?
R:  Those -- oh, yeah.  Those have been my worst ones.  I usually don't catch one going from, like, ah, fall into winter and that.  All --
L:  Yeah, [MN] 
R:  Almost never.  So --
L:  Do you think it's the change of the season?
R:  Ye- -- I don't know.  [MN] Ah, I don't know it's the change of the season.  I usually get 'em -- when I get 'em it's, ah, [NOISE] usually going from a hot house into, ah, you know, the cold weather --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- 'cause I don't bundle up enough.  I --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- usually -- I'll usually misjudge how cold it is.
L:  That's what it is.
R:  You know --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- what I'm saying?  But, ah, it -- it's -- 'cause I usual- -- when I was working -- 'cause I'm disabled now -- but, when I was working, ah, for me it was, ah, misjudging how cold it was actually outside.  And I wo- --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I didn't bundle up enough to go outside --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for me.  But --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- yeah.
L:  'Cause even in Boston right now it's -- it ka- -- it's like the weather teases us.  It goes from eighty to fifty, to forty, to ninety, you know.
R:  Oh, we don't get that problem.  It's just it gets cold and it stays cold here.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  [LAUGH] Just damp.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah, that's a worry -- with us it's some -- that's -- like, it's been damp for the last, ah, two or three weeks now.
L:  Really?
R:  Ah, yeah.  It's -- how can I put it?  It's -- it --
L:  Teeming[?] maybe?
R:  Not even human.  It's been cold and damp, ah --
L:  Yeah?  I don't like that.
R:  -- and -- and it -- it's been -- everybody here's been si- -- either, you know, sick or --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- it's -- it's -- it's been catching everybody off guard 'cause everybody's been running around thinking, "Wow, it's warm today" you know.  And they've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been running outside and it's really been, [MN] ah, damp, cold, you know.  Ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- hasn't really been warm.  It started off being warm in the mor- morning -- a little bit warm.  And they say, "Oh, it's gonna be warm all day" and they go outside.  And by time -- by sort of the afternoon it never get [MN] cool -- you know, warmer.  It'd just stay cold.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, ah, they -- like I said, it'd catch every -- ah, be outside in shorts and tee shirts and that. And they'd --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- just get cold, you know.  And they'd be -- you know, they'd get their chills, and that's where everybody gets sick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've got four children, and all four of 'em with me is -- you know, once one gets it, forget it -- it runs right through the family.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know what's worse with the doctor bills -- the ten dollar, ah, co pays or the -- the prescriptions they run all with 'em, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's crazy.
R:  Oh, it's incredible sometimes.
L:  You know, in those commercials too, you'll see a kid, like, sneezing into their hand and, like, shake hands with every other kid.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you don't know what worse -- whether they're shaking hands, or they're rubbing it off on their shirts and --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- they're going --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- hug somebody else, or --
L:  Oh.
R:  It's -- it's incr- -- you know, and kids don't know.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  -- you know, it's -- and the way they spread it, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and they -- some -- some guys are worse than the kids, you know -- some people.  I mean --
L:  I bet.
R:  [MN] I mean, do you seriously watch people when they go eat at these restaurants?
L:  You know --
R:   I mean --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- they -- they got those sneeze -- what do the call those thing over at those -- some of those restaurants where you go to, ah, um -- [LIPSMACK] I forgot what they call 'em.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Salad, ah, bars.
L:  Sorry?
R:  I mean, ah, the salad bars, you know, where, ah -- ah, you go in a --
L:  Oh yeah -- yeah.
R:  -- res- -- and they --
L:  Salad bar.
R:  -- got that -- [MN] you think about it. [MN]  Those are natural breeders for germs and that, and you walk in there and people wonder why they're getting sick all the time. 
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you sit -- you go up there and get your food, and then somebody's already sneezed and everything else.  And you don't think about it, but they got the glass covers and that you stand up over the food, like at these buffets.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  You know, th- -- and the people are standing there.  They sneeze.  They brought their hands up to cover their mouth and everything else, but where --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- where -- is there anything there to wipe your hands off with and that?
L:  [MN]
R:  Not really.  And they -- they can take[?] their spoon and they dig it back into the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- food that they just -- [LAUGH] I very seldom go to a buffet.  And I -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- know when -- when I go to get my food I take the spoon that I'm usually -- that they just bring out -- that's hot, and I use that to get my food with, you know.  I don't use --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] spoo- spoons -- yeah, right -- spoons or forks that they, ah, hand you to ladle the stuff out with.  I mean, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ridiculous.
L:  [MN] 
R:  But, I mean, [MN] you just -- it's just a breeding germ -- breed the germs [several inaudible words].  And then they keep it nice and humid for those things that grow for you.
L:  Right.  
R:  And [LAUGH] think about it.  It's their own -- what do they call those?  Cultivations fields. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Makes you wanna go out and have desert now, right?
L:  Oh yeah.  Yummy.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, that's the thing.  They say, um, like within -- 'cause I lived in a dorm.  And for every year I lived in a dorm --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, I got the worst colds ever.  And, you know, they say there's some new stain -- variant strains that -- you know, viruses and bacteria [NOISE] that goes around the dorms.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And some are extreme enough --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that were -- a student actually, you know, dies.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But --
R:  Well, how does that work out with, ah, the -- the -- I heard that they're coming out with, ah, rules and guidelines for, ah, exchange students now -- ah, not exchange -- um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  International students?
R:  Yes.  Ah, Chinese students and, ah, Korean -- not Korean -- um --
L:  Japanese?
R:  Ja- -- Hong Kong.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Ah, the -- 
L:  Oh, where the S.A.R.S. began?
R:  Yes.  That's where I --
L:  Yeah. 
R: -- was referring to.
L:  The Chinese and Hong Kong --
R:  [MN]
L: -- area.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, how's it --
L:  Yeah, 'cause for a while they had 'em quarantined.
R:  Right.  Ah, is -- I heard if they were -- if they go back home now that if they come back to the States now that they're -- they can't go back to school for a while or something.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I know they're doing it in some states now.  Ah, I think it's California, and, ah, there's a couple of other states.  Are you -- are you currently going to school now?
L:  Well, I just graduated.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, so that wouldn't --
L:  But, I had a couple of friends -- um, as we were graduating their parents couldn't come to the US, you know.
R:  Because of that?
L:  Because of the S.A.R.S. incident, right.
R:  Right.  For [inaudible] we go -- we go up to Toronto occasionally and, ah, you know, that's kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put this -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] slam on that, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When, ah, the -- yeah, I can't see the difference between going to Ontario -- ah, you know, Fort Erie and that, which we often go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- almost on a, ah -- monthly.  And, you know, what's the difference going to Ontario, which is just over the border from where we live -- a couple of miles, as compared to going to Toronto?
L:  ri- -- oh, ri --
R:  You know, which is, ah -- that's a hundred miles from the border --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- you know.  And, ah, they're telling us, "Well, where did you go?"  "Ontario".  "What'd you do?"  "Fort Erie race track"  "Well, er, ah --" and they're just sitting there stuttering.  They don't know what to say to you then, you know.  You come back -- and when you're coming back over the border.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And, you know, how do I know I didn't sit next to somebody that was in Toronto, you know?
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, it's -- it's ridiculous.  I mean, ah, you know, they don't know what to say to you.  And, you know, you sit there and you're talking to these people and yet you don't know where they're from.  You know, I don't care -- you know, you don't -- I -- I don't think about asking, "Well, were you talking to somebody -- were you next to somebody related to somebody that, ah, +S.A.R.S.?"  You know --
L:  Right. 
R: -- -- you don't of that type of thing.
L:  But, you know, like, S.A.R.S. began with that one guy who just -- who ate that mongoose type cat.  And it was that one guy who spread it to the rest of the plane.
R:  You know, I don't know how it started.  I was -- I was curious in finding out, and I --
L:  That's how.
R:  -- never did.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, is that how it was?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh.
L:  They just -- they just found out I think last week, or two weeks ago.
R:  He ate --
L:  It was, like, a mongoose type -- it was, like, a cat.  But, he pretty much ate it.  And so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, yeah.
R:  Must've been pretty hungry.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, he must've been hungry.  But yeah, it was that one guy who spread it to the plane -- um, the whole plane.
R:  That's pretty interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I don't know.  It -- it's just, ah, today who -- who can afford to get sick anymore?  Really, if you stop --
L:  That's --
R:  -- to think --
L:  -- true.
R:  -- of it, it -- you -- it sounds like you're coming down with something now.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] you can tell? 
R:  You --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you just did something with your nose a few seconds ago, and I just --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- picked up on it.  But, ah, who can -- you know, seriously, who can afford to get sick anymore?  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you get sick and you -- like, right away it's an -- it's an automatic --
