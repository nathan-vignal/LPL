R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] My name is, ah, Doris Creighton. [SIGH]
L:  Hi.  My name is Paula Price.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We're talking about, um, [SIGH] getting ill. [SIGH]
L:  Right.  But I -- I didn't hear what they said about -- something about going to the doctor?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, they said, ah, a cold, ah, if you don't go to the doctor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it will last for [PAUSE] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- seven days.  I think.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [PAUSE]
L:  [MN] 
R:  So, ah, now you know -- I done got confused now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Okay.  But, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I don't get -- I know that sh- -- um, I usually do not get a cold.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't either, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I don't think I could tell you the last that I h- -- that I had a cold.  Um, I'm normally very, very healthy, um 
R:  [LIPSMACK] That's good. [NOISE]  That's good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, um, one thing I do is, um, [LIPSMACK] if I feel, like -- when I've had a cold it usually starts --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with a sore throat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, usually what I do is, um, [LIPSMACK] if I just feel a little something in my throat [SIGH] I drink warm lemon water and that clears that up.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] and, um, I wouldn't be going to the doctor if I had a cold because, um, my doctor told me years ago that it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- runs about the same duration [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whether you go or not.  And, you know, you [MN] -- basically they can diagnose -- diagnose you and, um, [LIPSMACK], [SIGH] and, um, give you an a- antibiotic, I think.  I think that's what he said.  Or, either just give you aspirin for your uncomfortableness, and so when I've had a cold, ah, I've always just drunk lots of liquids and rested.  And it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was gone in no time.  So 
L:  Right.  Yeah --
R:  [LIPSMACK] So.
L:  -- I can remember once many, many years ago when I th- -- I had what I thought was a cold.  It started out being a cold, or at least I thought it did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, [COUGH] -- excuse me -- it went into an ear ache and my sinuses were, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really killing me and I did end up going to the doctor then, simply --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because I thought maybe it had, you know, become more than just a regular cold.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And, sure enough, it had.  I had, um, an ear infection, a sinus infection and an upper respiratory infection all wrapped up into one, so  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And he did give me antibiotics then.  But, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  But just for a regular cold, you know, like you say, you know, you drink pretty of fluids and, um, you know, get lots of rest, don't overexert yourself.  Because it's gonna last --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the duration of it's gonna be same whether you go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to the doctor and spend the big bucks to have him say, "Well, guess what?  You have a cold".  
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Or whether you just, you know, nurse it yourself. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah.  So, that's my experience.  Once the doctor told me that years ago, I mean, way, way, way [LIPSMACK] years ago, I never went --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if I had the symptoms of a cold.
L:  Well, I can remember --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when we were young my mom used to put Vicks --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  -- on our chests --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and so you could inhale the fumes and stuff at night.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I don't know whether it really did anything other than, you know, open you up and let you breathe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, I don't think it -- it helped as far as curing the cold any faster, but [LAUGH] --
R:  You don't think so?
L:  Well, I thi- --
R:  I know my mother used to give us -- when it was a cold season, she would give us cod liver oil.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Every morning.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, ah, we would have cod liver oil, and she would give us castor oil.  Ah, I think, like, on a weekly basis.
L:  Mm.
R:  And so we very seldom got a cold, um, basically we were able to go to school all the time.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  We didn't have --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I -- [MN] I think one of the things that they -- they said before you came on was, you know, um, do you do anything when the cold season approaches, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to prevent from getting them.  And -- and I never do.  
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH] I mean, I just [MN] -- I've always been so healthy.  I mean, when I was in school -- of course, we're talking thirty five years ago.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, you know, I would go for years with perfect attendance.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, if -- and if I had to, you know, if I got the flu or whatever and -- and wasn't able to -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go to school I was just devastated 'cause it ruined my perfect track record. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  But -- and -- and now even, you know, when I in -- as I'm in the workforce --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I -- I've missed one day in the last year and a half at work.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  So, you know, I -- I'm very, very lucky as far as that's concerned.  I'm -- I stay very healthy.  But then I look at my, um, my daughter who has a -- a four year old and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he goes to daycare and, um, he's constantly -- you know, a runny nose, um, you know, the -- the congestion, the coughing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and I think it's just from being around so many kids and -- and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that it's just inevitable I guess when they're in daycare like that --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- that they're going to get it.  You know, she gives him vitamins every day and -- and it just seems like nothing -- nothing helps, you know, she'll just ge- -- just get him [NOISE] over one episode of it and he'll be healthy, you know, for a week or ten days and then he comes home one day and, you know, he's got the -- the green gunk coming out of his nose again.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just, like, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, you've just barely got him healthy and now he starts it all over again.  But, it's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's -- when the kids are in daycare I just think it's just a vicious cycle.
R:  Right.
L:  I really do.
R:  Right.  I don't -- yeah, I think you're right, because they're so close to one another.
L:  Right.  And -- and they -- the, you know, kids don't think anything of, you know, they -- they -- they're playing with a ball, they sneeze on it and another kid picks it up and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, there it goes.  Gone from one kid to another, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's just inevitable, I think, that they -- until their immune system, you know, gets a little bit stronger I guess, but 
R:  Ahah. [LIPSMACK]
L:  And -- and then you've got the people that -- that come to work with it.
R:  Right. 
L:  You know, and --
R:  Right.  And, I tried to avoid peo- -- I do try to avoid people that have colds.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I do.  Um, [LIPSMACK] they have a cold I -- I try to keep my distance.  And when I have one -- [SIGH] when I did have one, I tried to keep away from people too.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause, um  I didn't --
L:  Yeah.  Some people, you know, they're a- -- I mean, they're just diehards so even though, the -- you know, it sounds like they're gonna hack up a lung, you know, you're --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just like, "Wouldn't you feel better if you were at home?".  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  And, they're like, "Oh no, I'm okay.  I'm don't feel as bad as it sounds". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And, yet --
L:  You're like, "Please " --
R:  -- that's true though.  Sometimes you really don't feel --
L:  Right.  But I --
R:  'Cause I can remember years ago --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- just sounding really horrible.  I mean, something like maybe ten years ago.  But I didn't really feel bad.
L:  Well, I used to, for several years in a row, I would get laryngitis, just out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of the clear blue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wouldn't -- it wouldn't hurt.  I would just wake up one day and I couldn't talk.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know.  And I'd go to work and they're like, "Well, don't you feel bad?".  I said, "No.  I feel fine".
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "I just can't talk".  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know.  And, no pre-symptoms or anything so I don't know whatever, you know, brought it on.  So, you're right.  Sometimes you do look or feel or, you know, you look like you should feel bad but you don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but [NOISE] there are some people -- I mean, we've had some people at work who come in an- and they're just -- I mean, they jus- -- they look like death warmed over, they're coughing and everything and -- and the managers have actually said, "Wouldn't you rather be at home?", you know.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Because, you're taking that chance of that one person because they don't want to call in sick.  In fact, in a whole offices of -- of eighty people.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know.  And --
R:  Well, that's good.  That's good that, um, [SIGH] they -- I mean that the manager told the peo- -- the person to go home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good.
L:  Well, I work for a company that it has very strict attendance policies and they're always on us about, you know, if you're not here and then somebody else is doing your job so, those of us who are very conscious about our job and -- and how we do it and stuff, you know, tend to probably sometimes go to work when we shouldn't but there are, you know, -- there has to be a point where you just say, "Okay, that's it.  I have to stay home today".  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But, you know what?  I think most companies are that -- I think -- I think most employees feel that companies feel that way.  That, ah, that you should be present and, um, [LIPSMACK] but then I think if you come and they -- they hear how bad you are then, um --
L:  They're more sympathetic --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- towards letting you go home.  
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] But, I mean -- y- -- I still think for most employees you probably feel like you still need to get back --
