R:  Hi, my name is Michelle.
L:  Hi, my name is Amelia.
R:  Hi Amelia.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  Good.
R:  They asked t- to us, to talk about food --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- what an easy thing to talk about [LAUGH]
L:  I know
R:  [LAUGH] Oh my god [LAUGH] my, and I actually prefer going out to restaurants.
L:  Do you really?
R:  I do. I don't it as often as I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- used to, but I -- I -- I kind of like the experience of going out to a good restaurant.
L:  Mhm, how often do you go out?
R:  Oh, these days not very often at all -- 
L:  Mhm, mhm
R:  -- um, I would say that there was a period in my life like maybe eight or nine years ago where I went out at least two or three times a week -- 
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  -- and everything, 'cause you know, that's when, you know, you and your friends get together -- 
L:  Mhm
R:  -- you socialize or you know, you just don't feel like cooking and that's [inaudible] also with the idea that you don't have a family to have to take care of --  
L:  That's right.
R:  -- or something like that.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Yeah, I like to go out but I -- I -- you know, once in a while, um, I usually do cook at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I do enjoy cooking -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot, so, um ...
R:  It's interesting, because in the last few years I like cooking too -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the sense of that it's creative for me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It makes me , I mean, it's not even so much the eating as it is the cooking.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  You know, that, that feeling of putting something together and maybe sometimes you know what you're doing, sometimes you don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that sort of thing.
L:  Right, that's um, it's just, and then you know your own food.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  You know, it's kind of like, especially sometimes with, of the things you hear --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- and now about what's, what's going on with restaurants and things --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- it makes you just a little more leery.
R:  It, it does, and -- a -- and -- and I like -- I'm -- I'm sort of like, I like e- ethnic food and stuff --
L:  Yes, yeah me too, mhm.
R:  -- so I like a lot of, I mean, I -- I just had a birthday and a friend of mine was saying , "Well, let's take you out for your birthday, where do you want to go?, and I said, "I don't know, I've got this thing about Indian food right now".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like I hadn't had any in a long time so I think I want that -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and you haven't, you go through st- periods of craving.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  You know, but they also, then in the question they said, like, describe your perfect meal.
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't think it's been invented yet.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  For me, anyway.
L:  [LAUGH] Probably -- 
R:  Although --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  I remember, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, about ten, no it's longer than that, maybe fifteen years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a bunch of my friends and I like made special reservations at this very fancy restaurant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything like that, and, I mean, so I'm talking a while ago and it was, you know, literally soup to nuts where the waiter or waitress was, was there before you could breathe and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything you wanted it, the whole, and you know, we, it was a treat for ourselves so we knew we'd spend money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, it's funny, to this day I can remember what I had for the appetizer, and what I had for dessert --
L:  You're kidding.
R:  -- because they were both so delicious.
L:  And what were they?
R:  It was a lobster ap-, lobster oh tail appetizer that was like in this, it was, the way they presented it you didn't want to eat it, it was so beautiful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it had this really light sauce on it and it was ver-, it was the most delicious thing.
L:  Wow.
R:  And for dessert -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there was champagne sorbet.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  To this d-, can I remember what I had for my main course?  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But those two things I remember, I said at the time, "I -- I could live on these two things, if you told me I couldn't anything else I could live on these two things".
L:  Mhm, mhm.  That's fine.
R:  So, maybe in the middle [MN] a really good piece of fish -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I'm a fish person, I like if a -- a nice baked like salmon or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something that's made really well and not like overdone and not a lot of sauce --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and stuff like that, you know.
L:  I think that's funny too because, um, with fish I like it a lot, you know I like it -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I hardly ever make it at home.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It doesn't, it doesn't come out the same for some reason.
R:  Never.  Unle-, the only thing that I know that I can't kill --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is salmon.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, salmon's pretty easy.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  I can, I could take, I can have nothing in the refrigerator -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if I can put together like mayonnaise, mustard -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a little spicing, spread it on the, the salmon, stick it underneath the -- the broiler --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it'll be perfect.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It comes out great.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You re-, you're right -- you have to really try hard to hurt a piece of salmon.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But you're right, in terms of other f-, like specialty fish --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or you know, 'cause there are so many v-, varieties and stuff now, it doesn't taste the same when you try it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, and I especially like, um, I don't know, have you ever been to Thai restaurants?
R:  Oh, I love 'em, yeah.
L:  And the, the fish that they make -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, the, it's kind of like a, um, it's just very crunchy --
R:  Right.
L:  And it's ah, I forget what the name of it is, but it's just, it's just really, really good.
R:  Well, do you like the spicing or do you just like the texture?
L:  I like the whole thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I like the whole thing and I can never make, I can't make anything like that, so --
R:  Well, you -- that's just it, you don't have the ingredients --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you don't have the set up that they have.
L:  That's right.
R:  That's part of it, you know.  Unless you go to like a really good seafood restaurant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's by the ocean and they're doing it, 'cause they do it all the time [MN], I don't think you can do fish, unless, and everybody likes to fry fish, I'm not a big fried fish person anymore --
L:  Mhm, no not me.
R:  -- you know, it's like, I want it so I can taste the fish.
L:  Right.
R:  Not the bread and the crumbs, I want the fish [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's funny how many people don't like fish.
L:  I know.
R:  And I'm, I think it's partially 'cause of the way my father and my grandfather used to like go fishing.
L:  Oh really?  Oh.
R:  Oh, well they're from down in North Carolina -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff and -- and not that I would go fishing with them, bleh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, that's where I kind of learned to like fish -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, 'cause it was there all the time -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I would go visit my, my grandparents and stuff, but no, I -- you know, a good piece of fish I'm set, and now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now, they're telling you it's all healthy for you, it's so good for you and I'm like "Yeah, we know".
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH]  That's right.
R:  What's new?  You know, that kind of thing.  But, are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you big on desserts?
L:  Um, oh I could, I love desserts, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I could really eat desserts.  I mean, you know, that's -- that's chocolate cake --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, tiramisu, you know, those kinds of things --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- all that ah, good stuff, but you know, I really, really need to kind of, I'm -- I'm really, especially now with the food topic it's something because I'm trying to really control what I eat so I'm really kinda trying to really stay away from certain things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, mhm.
R:  I understand that part.  
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  It's like [MN] I was reading something the other day about the fact that you know, if you, if you -- the beginning of your meal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is, is small, and the middle of your meal is a little bit larger then your dessert needs to be really small.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, in comparison to the, the other parts of it.  If you're going to have three parts of a meal, you know --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- or something like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and everything and -- but I still think that you need to have that sweet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it doesn't have to be like major sweet, you can have a piece of fruit, you could have, you know --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- whatever, but you need the sweet to cut your appetite at the end --
L:  Right.
R:  -- otherwise, you just like don't really feel fulfilled.
L:  Full, that's right.
R:  You know --
L:  And they, and the thing that I'm -- I'm  -- I'm doing now is that you're, you are allowed sweets but you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's, it's -- it's more calorie counting than anything else.
R:  Do you find like, 'cause you said you're -- you're -- you're watching what you eat -- 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- do you find that you're more attracted to, um, like natural sweet things as opposed to refined s- -- like -- like a piece -- something that's made with fruit as opposed to something that's all sugar?
L:  You mean now that I'm kinda --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I still -- I -- I don't get -- I don't seem to have the craving as badly as I did --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, I mean and I -- and f- -- and I do like fruit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I will eat the fruit but I -- I do need, I still need, I still like the -- the little bit of the chocolate, or --
R:  Well, oh okay, like --
L:  -- you know, I still like that.
R:  Like, I wrote this to someone the other day, "When all else fails, there is chocolate".
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  Of course, that goes without saying.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, I'm sort of like, in that place where ah, if there's a choice between say a little apricot square -- 
L:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.
R:  -- and, and something that's just full --
L:  Full of --
R:  -- of sugar --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like you know, totally refined --
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  -- I'll go to the apricot square, 'cause, [MN] to -- to me that's more rich --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that's more --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- flavorful and tasty to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's just -- I -- I -- I think that happens when you get older [LAUGH].
L:  Probably so [LAUGH].
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- things that -- that -- that are too easily made you're like, "Nah, I don't want that" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- something that took a lot of time -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's what I want, that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah, yeah, mhm, mhm.
R:  But, ah, do you, did you grow in a big family?
L:  Um, two ah, a brother and my mother and father --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, we -- we used to, actually my father used to go out crabbing, and we --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we used to go with him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so we used to um, I mean that's how I learnt how to eat, um, you know clams on the half shell -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, um, but I used to like a little [inaudible] I didn't like the big ones.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I used to -- they used to have to be a certain size, the little [inaudible] and then I would eat them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- raw, and people, people would say, "How can you eat that?".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't -- I hardly ever do that now, but um --
R:  But it's also, I mean, food --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  --any taste for any food is learned anyway --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- most of the time.  I keep thinking about when I was younger and the idea of eating a strawberry was like, so disgusting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to me, and then all of a sudden, like, when I was like fourteen or something, I said "Let me try this again" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was wonderful --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so you, you know, you- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your habits change, your taste buds change --
L:  [inaudible] change.
R:  -- everything changes.  You know, I, I didn't come up -- I didn't grow up in a big family but, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of extended grandparents around and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you know, and food was not like the center of our being 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- every day or, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but you had a big meal on Sun-, you know, family gathering on Sundays -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff like that --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and then, but then I have friends who like are from big, big families and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything's about food.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, we -- we grew up in an um, you know with my aunts and uncles and all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all the holidays we would go there or they would come here and of course it was a lot around food.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  It was around food, it was like we never got up from the table.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I always thought it was kind of, I mean, I liked it because they made a special big deal out of it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like a Thanksgiving or Christmas --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and my mother would do the whole, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we had to have the little fruit cocktail, and we have to have this, 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and the little crunchies on the table --
L:  Oh, you didn't just have the turkey, you had the turkey, the lasagna, you had --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the whole thing.
R:  Everything, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you're right, you didn't get up, because everybody fell asleep at the table --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that kind of thing.  But those kind of meals are good, you know --
L:  Yeah they are, they're good.
R:  -- you know, you, it makes you appreciate food.
L:  Except we don't, we don't do that anymore, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  it's just, we, you realise that it's just too much --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know you're not going to finish everything and you know [inaudible] --
R:  Well, see but that's why you have paper plates and aluminum foil to wrap it up and take it home.
L:  That's, that's true [LAUGH].
R:  I went to, this is going to sound funny, to ...
