R:  My name's Ivo.
L:  Ivo?
R:  Yeah, I.V.O.
L:  Hi Ivo, I'm Sheryl.
R:  Hi Sheryl.
L:  How's it going?
R:  It's going pretty well.  This is kind of odd, but entertaining.
L:  Yeah it was a -- it was a strange, um, topic.  I didn't get -- we're -- we're thinking about what is worse between drinking, smoking, gossiping, over eating and what else?
R:  I didn't -- quite honestly, I didn't catch all of the -- all of them myself.  I -- I'm on speaker phone so it was a little garbled.  But you're coming in clear.
L:  Oh well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well um, that was what she said, the -- the operator.
R:  Sure.
L:  In your opinion what was worse, ah, drinking, smoking, gossiping, overeating, and I couldn't understand the other ones.
R:  Sure.  Um, well let's see.  I suppose it depends on how you look at it, in terms of personal habits, I guess, smoking, you can sort of say is a bad habit in the sense that it can affect other people, you know, more seriously.
L:  If you do it around them.  But if you do it alone then you're on your own, right?
R:  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  [COUGH] Almost any of 'em, they hurt other people.  I think the one that hurts other people the most, ah, is the gossiping.
R:  Yeah, that certainly could, yeah, especially --
L:  I really think that that's a very, very bad habit, you know.
R:  Sure.
L:  And it's something that is -- is hard to quit when people are, you know, in the practice of doing it and it's hard to get people to quit it too.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure that, ah, most people that are serious gossipers get a lot of, you know, like, personal validation out of people wanting to hear what they say and so 
L:  Yeah.  Um, I know -- I don't really have to interact with a whole lot of people in the work that I'm doing right now.  I'm working, like, within an office building --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- but as a contractor --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I'm in a position to hear other people and a lot of their back and forth and it's something that I personally revile.  I try to get people to knock it off if they ever do it to me, you know.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think that um, I don't know, in the US there seems to -- the -- the aspect of personal business has kind of been lost.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know what I mean?  
L:  Yeah.  As in mind your own, you know.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly, you know it -- there -- there are basic things that are somebody's personal business such as, ah, their romantic way, their personal habits that aren't affecting anybody else seriously --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- politics and religion if they don't choose to go there.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I think that is probably the most harmful of the things, the subjects that I did hear.  It could do the most harm to other people and they're never even aware, perhaps, that people are talking about them and damaging their reputation from a distance, like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- words are powerful, you know.  Sure, you know, you don't want people drinking and driving, so you know, and you don't want people drinking and getting cerotic[?] and up to that, anything to excess is going to be considered wrong but I think that gossip is the most harmful thing that -- that was listed, personally.
R:  Sure, yeah.  I -- I -- I can see that.  I think that -- I think that any of them could, you know, definitely harm or -- or -- or even eventually kill the person who is actually performing them, even gossip really, but, ah, yeah, I think probably the -- the thing that involves, potentially involves, the most people and at it's worst could be the worst, would be gossip, I mean, literally you can start a war over gossip, at some level.
L:  You know, words are very powerful and they last forever, really.
R:  Well at least as long as anybody is listening or paying attention.
L:  Well I mean, you know, if somebody gives you a bad reference, say, you know?
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  That can follow you for a very long distance.
R:  Yeah, that -- that hit me, ah, at one point.  A supervisor had no personal sense of humor and I was, you know, making the occasional joke and made a joke right in a big meeting and, ah, they really didn't appreciate it.
L:  Even though, you, you know, they couldn't give you a break for shooting yourself in the foot, huh?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  And so they kind of spread it around that you weren't a serious person?
R:  Well, ah, in this case, um, they -- they didn't really do that much to me in the job, but then later, when they, um, when, you know, somebody went back to the previous company I'd worked for, for a reference, they -- they then talked about bad about me.
L:  Yeah, you know, that's against the law.
R:  Yeah, pretty much.
L:  You know.  They don't even have to even use words to do it though, I know it can be just a hesitation.
R:  Uh-huh.  So sounding --
L:  So they just so completely --
R:  Concerned, yeah --
L:  -- i- -- implied so em- -- ephemeral is that, you know.
R:  Absolutely.  What -- you said you're a contractor, what do you do?
L:  Um, I work for a cleaning company.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so I'm doing, like, four hours a day in this office building.  They've got, like, five hundred women and five levels.
R:  Sure.
L:  And I go in mid day and restock paper and try to clear away some of the ordure, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
L:  So you hear people talk all day long, you don't really interact with them that much, you know, there's -- some of them say hello and then you just say back hello and that's it because you're working and they need to get back to their desks.
R:  You're sort of the ear on the wall, as it were.
L:  In a way yeah, it -- it's a -- it's a strange position.  It's very strange.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah, and it [COUGH] it's always, um -- and I'm not sure [COUGH] excuse me, I -- I haven't known very many men, their brains work differently.  I don't think they engage as much in that --
R:  I think that -- I think that, um, especially --
L: -- or in other people's business, that way.
R:  I think in this culture, especially, I think men are much more action oriented --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and women are much more, sort of social relationship oriented.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, yeah, I think that's sort of a side affect of that, that men do- -- men don't spend as much time talking about what people, um, you know, have done or how they feel, more likely they're out doing something, ah, you know, if they're -- if they're being negative they're doing something that's a problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As opposed to just damaging somebody's reputation by saying things about them that they know little or nothing about, or things that are none of their business.
R:  Yeah.  In public school, I think that, ah, girls have, ah, girls have fights by spreading rumors and -- and ah, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- starting that kind of fight, as it were.
L:  Yeah, as opposed to getting it over with.
R:  Yeah, and guys will actually go outside and -- and knock it down, you know.
L:  You know, that -- that's probably more direct and less lasting harm.
R:  Yeah, probably, at least most of the time.
L:  Yeah.  I would think, yeah, you -- you settle things you -- you figure out who's the bigger one, who's the righter one instead of all the subterfuge, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if you try to get people to knock it off all the time too, you know, you -- you also will hear, ah, you'll experience it pretty easily yourself, like, who does she think she is?  Better than us not to go talking about people?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know what you mean.
L:  Yeah.  Still, I -- I make that my stance anyway, I mean, like I said, I haven't lately had a chance to have to, like, necessarily stand up like that, but I'll do it, you know --
R:  Yeah, no that's --
L:  -- like were you there when it happened?  Did it concern you?  Was it about you?  Then, you know, shut up.
R:  Yeah, good for you.
L:  I mean, bigger people, they talk about ideas, smaller people talk about other people.
R:  Yeah, especially, ah, especially details and speculation, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and they what if's, right.  Yeah, yeah, rumors and stuff, they're very harmful, you're right, they can down right cause a war.
R: Yeah.
L:  Yeah --
R:  And besides, I think --
L:  -- and the other things they mentioned, they're -- they're kind of, you know, well, you think about, well, second hand smoke and stuff, well if the smoker wants to keep it to themselves then they really only hurting themselves.  If a drinker doesn't drink and drive, again, they're really only compromising their own health and prospects, but a gossip is more pervasive.  More insidious.
R:  Yeah, oh well, I -- I'll stretch it and say that I think that probably all of them at their worst can be really hideous, but ah, you know, like if a, you know, you said, you know, if a smoker smokes up a storm even in inappropriate circumstances that starts to be a problem, like for instance, around their children all the time for example.
L:  Yeah, that's wrong of course, but that's just a --
R:  You know, and if -- if somebody drinks and fights and drives and does all that stuff, that can be really bad, um, but I think -- I think yeah, I -- I -- I kind of agree with you that ah, that gossiping can be much larger scale and can affect a lot more people than any one person with a bad habit.
L:  And especially if other people take it up as a habit, even if they don't really mean to, well you know, if they engage in it and it satisfies something in them and then they start doing it, then it spreads.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I think i- -- in many ways all of these things come down to, you know, maybe not being raised the right way by your parents or whatever.  Um, but, ah, but yeah, they can all be --
L:  Socialization.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Socialization and -- and feeling loved and cared for and accepted just for the way you are, you know.
L:  Yeah, and being able to extend that to other people so it -- it kind of boils down to self respect and extending that to others.
R:  Yeah, dignity and self respect.  Agreed. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You know, because they can talk to you about these other physical things, of course your parents lecture you, don't drink, don't smoke, you know, and you're encouraged not to overeat and to have good health that way and everything, you know, but um, maybe they don't always think about, you know --
R:  Yes, gossip's a little less direct.
L: -- the harm that you can do people with your words.
R:  Obvious.  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  At least until it comes up.
R:  Sure.
L:  It might be something better to be a little preemptive
