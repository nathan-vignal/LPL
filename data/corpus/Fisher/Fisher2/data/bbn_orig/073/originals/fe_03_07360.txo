L:  Hi, my name is Judy. [SIGH]
R:  Hi, Judy.  My name is Sue.  And ah, I don't get any, ah, um, illnesses with the change of season.  
L:  Mm.
R:  I get a little spring fever.  I feel a little bit more up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't feel physically ill.  What about you?
L:  I see.  Um 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I really do get ill when the seasons change.  I live in Michigan. [SIGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, usually it's like a sinus infection or even pneumonia when the -- when the seasons change.  I think it's such a -- kind of an assault on the body, because here we can go from, you know, ten below to seventy in [LAUGH] a matter of a couple of days.  And, it really does affect me.  And I also, ah, have allergies and asthma.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, what do you take for your allergies?
L:  Um, for my allergies I tend to just take Benadryl [SIGH] and for asthma I -- I have to take Advair.  And what do you take for yours?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm -- I'm -- I'm very fortunate.  I just, thank God, do not have any reaction -- I -- to the change of weather --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- except sometimes the humidity is very, very great.  I live in New York. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, the humidity is very, very heavy and, ah, [NOISE] today we-  What happens with us is we go from [SIGH] the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, severe changes which is what happens with you.  We -- we went from forty degrees to sixty seven or from fifty degrees to eighty today.  [SIGH] And, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, what I -- I feel funny about is that, um, when you walk into an air conditioned place --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we feel that maybe we will get sick because we are all overheated and that we're going into this ice cold environment, which is -- like the subway. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And, ah, one of the things, [MN] living in New York is, you get caught up with the rush of people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so you get overheated very fast. [LIPSMACK] And, so that -- that's the worry about it.  But, um, if I have a cold [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I really don't take anything for it.  I just feel that, ah, it's gonna go away and it's going to take as long as it takes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I just have to get rid of it.  [SIGH] But, I do have one old fashioned remedy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which my mother taught me.  Which was, um, [LIPSMACK] taking a -- a pot of water and putting it on the stove and steaming it.  You know, let the steam rise --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and put a towel over my head, and that usually helps me clear my sinuses or clear my head, whatever way I have to do it. [LIPSMACK]
L:  That's a good idea.
R:  This is the first time I'm talking to someone.  Have you done this before?
L:  Yeah, I've done it once before.  And, I understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we can do it a total of three times, I think.
R:  Yes.  Well, I feel that -- it's very important to, um, [LIPSMACK] contribute to any kind of science. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, right.
R:  [SIGH] And, this is, of course, something scientific.  Right now, ah, my husband has been, ah, sneezing with the change of seasons here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because all the flowers are in bloom.
L:  Right.
R:  And, we have more flowers this year than ever before because we had so much rain and so much green. [LIPSMACK] So, ah --
L:  Right.  It's been a very --
R:  It's been very good.  Pardon me?
L:  It's been a cool spring here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very cool and damp and, ah, like, my son has allergies and he's -- he's having quite a bit of trouble with that but   Also, what you mentioned about the air conditioning.  When, ah, a person goes into the cold air conditioning then comes out into the humidity and the heat, and goes back and [NOISE] forth, you know, several times a day doing their, you know, any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- duties or chores they have to do.  I think that's a real shock on the body too.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I also have arthritis, so the humidity affects that greatly.  Makes it a lot worse.
R:  Do you believe in taking anything for the arthritis?
L:  Um, I do -- I actually have to see a pain specialist and I have, um, injections into my spine to help the arthritis there, like, of steroids and pain killers. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I have to do that or I can really not -- not walk.
R:  I don't know if you saw, um, Jerry Lewis the other day on television.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Did you see him?
L:  I saw him.  I was very shocked by his --
R:  Did you --
L:  -- appearance.
R:  By his -- yes, but did he have a chance to talk about this thing that he's taking for pain?
L:  I didn't catch that.
R:  Ah, he has, um, [LIPSMACK] he has something inserted into his body which is like a pace maker.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And, he has a -- a -- a remote control of some kind that when he is in pain he, um, he touches his body in this certain place, which is really around his waist line --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, with this remote control and it gives him some relief.  You know, his pains are all, ah, from his back from all the prank falls that he took.
L:  Right.
R:  ah, but, you could see that he was on some sort of steroids because he is, um, [LIPSMACK] all swollen [NOISE] and he looks like the Pillsbury. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  I felt so sorry for him.  His poor face was just --
R:  The -- the Pillsbury muffin man whatever he is, you know.
L:  Yeah.  His --
R:  He's -- he's -- he's all bloated up so he's just one mass of -- of blubber.  That's exactly what he looks like right now, and I felt so sorry for him becau- --
L:  I did to.
R:  Because he said something about, um, [LIPSMACK] he can't pick up his daughter --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- because, um, he -- ever- -- wherever she touches him, you know, it's painful.  And, you know the way children like to be cuddled and so forth --
L:  They do.
R:  -- and so on.  But, since he this new, ah, thing in his body -- this electronic thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's able, um, to hug her and pick her up.  At least touch her.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Not pick her up yet.  And, um, I think that what we have to do preserve ourselves as best we can. [MN]
L:  Right. 
R:  Do you exercise?
L:  [SIGH] I do.  The only thing I'm able to do is stretching exercise.  And, luckily my doctor does likes to go the natural approach so he has suggested a lot of supplements, ah, for me.  And, I'm starting to try some of them one by one to see which ones work.  Like, for example, he said cherry juice --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is very good for arthritis.
R:  I've never heard that.  It's --
L:  Yep.  It's the tart cherry juice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they, ah -- we grow a ton of cherries in Michigan [LAUGH] and --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- the tart cherries -- and, ah, you take one ounce, I believe, in a glass of water, and they say it work wonders for arthritis and fibromyalgia and things like that. [LIPSMACK] So, I'm gonna give that a try.  But, I am doing the soy milk and the B vitamins that he recommended.  But, I'm taking them one at a time. [LIPSMACK] But, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they ask also, you know, you had said about when you get a cold you don't usually go to the doctor for it, you try the steaming, you know?
R:  Mhm.  The only fashioned remedies.
L:  I try that too, like, chicken soup and --
R:  Well, chicken soup has got -- it's instant penicillin they say.
L:  Exactly.  I always put a lot of garlic in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the chicken soup and try that first and a lot of liquids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  I put gar- -- let me tell you something.  I put garlic --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- in every recipe that doesn't call for vanilla.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Okay?
L:  That's great.  That's great.
R:  We're -- we're very big on garlic.  It keeps away the vampires.
L:  [LAUGH] I've heard that.
R:  We have never had a vampire yet. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, excellent.
R:  We've been very, very lucky.
L:  Excellent. [LAUGH] That's a great idea.  I need to use more garlic too.  But, I've found it really does help, ah, when you're getting a cold.  Do you feel that way too?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, well, I think it keeps away a lot of people so, [LAUGH] you know, it's [inaudible]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I -- when you get a cold you get a cold because the germs have been passed to you not because you've walked out with a [MN] wet head --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or you did anything else.  It's just that you've been in a place where someone's sneezed and the germs have been passed to you in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some way. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, I just feel that you just gotta keep on going and, you know, get rid of it.  Ah, I had -- I'm not an exercise person, but I'm a walker.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I walk four miles every day early in the morning and, ah, I -- I -- and I think that's very good.  And, also laughter is supposed to be wonderful.
L:  Oh.  Wonderful.  Wonderful medicine.
R:  Th- the only problem is in today's day and age we are not laughing as much as we should. [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  That's the problem.  That's the pressure.
L:  No.  And, you've especially had a lot of, ah, problems in New York.
R:  Well, you know, it's -- ah, we have just moved in to the city [LIPSMACK] and, ah, it's very frightening now because I'm not used to all the sirens, you know.  The, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] police sirens, the fire alarm, the ambulances.  And, when I hear them, a lot of them, I put on the television to see if there's something going on.  Because, I s- -- I was unfortunate to see the World Trade, ah, Towers going down, as they were going down, you know.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And, I should never forgive it as long as I live.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh.  The most --
L:  What a horror.
R:  -- horrible thing in the whole world. [LIPSMACK] Well --
L:  Ah, I can't imagine.
R:  Well, it -- i -- i- -- if you wouldn't -- can't imagine what that whole in the ground looks like.
L:  Yes.
R:  In the middle of a -- a -- of a big city and, um, [LIPSMACK]  and you cannot imagine the anxiety --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we felt here, ah, until I heard from my children.
L:  No.
R:  Because my -- my daughter worked a- [LAUGH] across the street from the Trade Center.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And my son also wor- worked downtown.  [SIGH] And, ah, until I heard from them -- and we couldn't -- they couldn't get -- didn't have telephones -- they wound emailing [LIPSMACK] a member in the family who was able to
