L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [MN]
L:  My name is Sheena.
R:  You're like Sheena?
L:  Yes.
R:  And I'm Lane.
L:  Lane?
R:  Yes, uh --
L:  How are you?
R:  Right now I'm sleepy.
L:  You're sleepy?  Why are you sleepy [LAUGH]?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't get my nap.
L:  Oh, no [LAUGH].
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Dallas, Texas.
R:  Oh, lio- -- I live in Greenwich that's in Oregon --
L:  Oh, okay.  Well --
R:  -- and it's -- it's two o'clock here so it must be four o'clock there.
L:  Oh, yeah [NOISE].
R:  Okay.  I didn't get the -- I kn- -- I know there was something about illness.
L:  I think when seasons --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- change do we get sick, get illnesses --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- colds and --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- what do we do to prevent those or to help out.
R:  Well, um, when the seasons change there -- I do have problems, um, like the -- in the spring the pollen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, in other words I -- I sneeze and -- and my eyes itch [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but you know what I generally do?
L:  What do you do?
R:  Nothing.
L:  Nothing [LAUGH]?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I've tried, I've tried various things but they don't seem to help that much.
L:  Really?  I choose over the counter.
R:  You do?
L:  Yeah, um, I use, uh, I don't know if you all have Walmarts over there but --
R:  Well, we have those out here.
L:  Yeah, we -- I use their off brand equate allergy medicine and it seems to be doing -- it seems to do okay.  The only thing is --
R:  I guess --
L:  -- I never take it like they tell you.  They tell you to take it, you know, a couple --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of weeks or whatever, a month before your allergies start but I never think about them until they come.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, that's about the way it is with me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Though I've -- I have taken Allegra.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  Iris t- -- arts.  We have a son that has a problem and -- and, uh, so he -- he gave me one of his to try and it worked [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  -- but sometimes this stuff gets so expensive --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, uh, you know, the medications -- I take about five different prescriptions and I just can't afford to keep, you know, and if I --
L:  Another one.
R:  -- can get by without, well, that's what I'll do --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and then when winter comes, of course, uh, the flu shots and --
L:  Yes [NOISE].
R:  -- uh, but I don't have many -- much of a problem in as far as colds are concerned.  Uh --
L:  I don't seem to have a lot myself.  I do have the allergies arou- -- around the springtime and a little bit into the fall when the seasons --
R:  Right.
L:  -- start changing and the winds start changing directions and things like that --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- so I --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- I really don't have that much of a problem [NOISE].
R:  Well, it's, uh, I'm a diabetic, too, so, uh, being a diabetic that's why I take so many prescriptions --
L:  Oh, yeah [NOISE].
R:  -- that, um, um, I have to be, well, I don't have to be, I need to be and I -- I do pretty well, uh, observe the [LAUGH] what the doctor tells me to do [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- but, uh, he said it's alright if I, um, have some ice cream once in a while --
L:  Right [NOISE].
R:  -- so, I went back to him, uh, about three months later and he says, "Well, how's the ice cream"? and I said, "Well, it's okay" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh, he said, "Uh, well, how often you have it"? and I said, "Every night before I go to bed" [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  If he's --
L:  I'm sure he didn't like that, did he?
R:  He said, "I said once in a while" --
L:  [LAUGH] Not every night.
R:  -- and -- and he said, "I told " -- and he said, "Are you buying those half gallons?" and I said, "Yeah" --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he said, "I told you not to do that".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know what the idea was.  I'd have to go into town to, uh, get me an ice cream cone [NOISE] and I wouldn't do that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as often [LAUGH], so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh [LIPSMACK], it's, um, like I say, it's, uh, the older we get the more problems we're running into I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah [LAUGH], um --
R:  Um, so, healthwise, how are you [LAUGH]?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  You're fine.
L:  Yeah.  I've got the diabetic that runs in my family but, um, I've been diagnosed with hypoglycemia so it's kind of a form --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of that [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] which can --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I --
L:  It's not the medication part but -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  -- it --
L:  -- other than that occasional allergies and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] two children --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's enough for me [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Uh, are you a homemaker?
L:  No, I work.
R:  You work?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You work outside the home?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh --
L:  I do work full time.
R:  -- and what kind of work?
L:  I'm a lab technician for cosmetics --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for, um, a cosmetic company in Dallas [NOISE].
R:  Uh-huh.  My wife is, uh, well, she doesn't do it much anymore but she used to -- aloe vera products --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and anyway she still -- she doesn't try to promote it.  Anybody wants some she still, uh, avai- -- can get the stuff --
L:  Right [NOISE].
R:  -- the -- I think it seems like this was out of Dallas.  It can -- was out of Texas anyway [LAUGH].
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, though I think there is a couple of companies here in Dallas.
R:  I know this is probably been -- she's probably been with this twenty years or so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's [NOISE] -- it's good stuff as far as, you know, for the -- the purposes it can be used for but, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I see now since it -- it seems like everything's got aloe vera in it.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, the soaps and the lotions and -- and whatever, uh --
L:  It's a good moisturizer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Right.
R:  Good for burns, too.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, I don't know whether burns are sickness or not [LAUGH].
L:  No.  I know that it -- if you drink it it cle- -- it cleanses your body so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that might be a prevention from illnesses as well.
R:  Right.  Well, that's, uh, there -- there are a couple of people that she has -- she still has that say, uh, they get it, uh, regularly because of, uh, that property.
L:  Huh.
R:  One fella, he has a problem with alcohol and he [MN] -- he buys it because he says [LAUGH] it helps him --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for a hangover [LAUGH].
L:  Well, it might do that, huh?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Probably cleanses out the toxins that he put in there.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Yeah, that might make sense of his illnesses as well so --
R:  Yeah. Right.
L:  -- cleanses out the body and gives it a fresh new start, maybe.
R:  Maybe, yeah.
L:  Might be something to try.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How many calls have you made --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- or had?
L:  I've only had two.
R:  You only -- well, this makes my second one.
L:  Really?  Yeah, I just -- I just started and it's not too bad.
R:  No, it's -- it's my third one.
L:  Oh.
R:  I talked to a fella yesterday from Philadelphia --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Monday from, uh, Mount Vernon, Washington --
L:  That was pretty cool.
R:  -- so, we get around the country.
L:  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  My wife is the one that got me into doing this and I didn't want to do it at first but it, you know, it's kind of interesting.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They discuss the things they want to discuss and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- talk on the phone and meet people from another country -- other --
R:  Right.
L:  -- states --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and stuff.
R:  Well, oh, what else can we talk about, I mean [LAUGH] --
L:  I think they asked the question, um [LIPSMACK], I think, um, the saying is that if you don't go to the doctor or treat your illnesses it could last past or up to seven days or past seven days.  Have you heard that?
R:  Yeah.  Um, anyway, I -- I have regular appointments that I, you know, like every three or four months --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, of course, if I -- if I run into an illness and it -- it persists and I can't get in to see my primary doctor then, uh, they have an, uh, an outpatient, uh, where you can get in any time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and if it's bad enough I -- I've done that, uh, once or twice and -- but I do try to, you know, I don't want to become a hypochondriac but at the same time I don't like to, uh, uh --
L:  Let things linger around?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just, uh -- otherwise you going to let things go too long.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I think -- I don't let things go too, too long but I do tend to put things off but when it comes to my children I'll take them immediately.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Myself, I always put if off [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll be all...
