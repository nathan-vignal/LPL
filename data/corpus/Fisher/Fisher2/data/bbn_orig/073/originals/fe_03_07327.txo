L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Sandra.
L:  Hi, I'm Rebecca.  [SIGH] I'm calling from Boston.
R:  Oh, I'm in Providence.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Not too far away [LAUGH].
L:  So, you're enjoying the same rainy weather that we are?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How has that been affecting your health?
R:  Um, not too badly.  Um, yesterday it was a little warm and we went out for a walk and there were so many, sort of, pollen buds --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- floating around and it's a bit uncomfortable -- it's nice to enjoy the weather, but it's so uncomfortable to walk around at that time.  What about you?
L:  Oh well, I don't have many -- I don't have allergies, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that I don't have to worry about [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] -- it's lucky [LAUGH].
L:  [MN].
R:  Yeah, it can be really difficult for some people though, I mean they get --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- I've got a big Linden tree out in front of my house and I have a friend who's very allergic to that --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- comes over to the house during this time of year and he just swells right up [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I'm -- and -- as the summer gets on it gets worse and worse -- so it gets -- it's pretty hard.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, well, let's see -- yeah, um, other kind of weather related illnesses -- [MN] -- I guess ah, you know, colds and the flu --
R:  Yeah, during the winter, yeah.
L:  Yeah -- it's not exactly the right season to be talking about that [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] The odd one though are people who get um, nose bleeds when it's very humid [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, I've never known anybody --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to do that.
R:  Yeah, they just um have -- I don't know, I don't know how it happens, but um, during high humidity they just can't tolerate it, so ...
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, my husband had ah, a serious case of pneumonia when he was a kid, so every spring he, he picks up whatever colds are going around --
R:  Gosh.
L:  -- whatever, you know, a lung infection is going around, he'll get it every spring -- and then he gets you know, the usual ones in the winter as well [LAUGH].
R:  Gosh, gosh.  I didn't know that it sort of had um --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- lingering effects.
L:  Yeah, you -- you get the, um, the pneumonia and then you tend to pick up bronchitis --
R:   Mhm, mm.
L:  -- and then, you know, the bronchitis will make you sus- susceptible to colds -- it's -- it's -- [LAUGH] it's a really bad thing [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  It must make him a bit paranoid also, um, you know, when he sees people who are ill -- being worried about catching it --
L:  [MN]
R:  'cause I guess it makes him more, um, susceptible to getting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- those illnesses in other people.
L:  Yes, yes it does [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Well, we haven't got anybody with SARS around here, so I guess we're safe from that [LAUGH].
R:  Oh my gosh, that was terrible, yeah [MN].  Was there a lot of fear in Boston about it?  I guess with the underground, and the [inaudible] ...
L:  Well, we had a couple of cases of suspected SARS, but I don't think anybody turned out to actually have it --
R:  Mm, that's a relief.
L:  -- there's a very large Chinese population in Boston.
R:  Yes, yeah it's true.
L:  [MN] So ... but it was, it was all just paranoia.
R:  Yeah, at least.  'Cause Toronto had um, such a, you know, they had to do a lot of damage control --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- regarding SARS in, in the city and trying to convince people to come and it wasn't so bad.
L:  And it looks like they've got it again, too.
R:  Have they?
L:  Yeah, the newspaper said third wave of SARS in Toronto.
R:  Oh my god, oh gosh.
L:  Yeah -- the, the healthcare community keeps reinfecting itself --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's not really gotten out into the public --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's just sort of running around the hospitals.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  That's even worse.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't how safe I'd feel going in there at the moment just to get any gen-, you know, general treatment for something.
L:  [MN]  Well, I'm going to Montreal this weekend, so ... [LAUGH] that's far enough away.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  That's a nice city -- I knew someone who lived there for a couple of years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she loved it -- really, really nice.
L:  Well, I've only been to the downtown area, so I don't know what it's like to live there --
R:  Mm.
L:  There's an awful lot of urban sprawl, that's for sure.
R:  Is there?
L:  Yeah just -- I -- I had to drive out to the airport and there was just wave on wave on wave, on -- of ah, condo developments and apartment buildings --
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  -- doesn't seem to be much in the way of like, suburbs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was like the city and then there's all these tightly packed residential areas and then all of a sudden you're out in the middle of the country.
R:  Gosh.
L:  [MN]  I suppose that's what it's like in most of the world --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just not like that here [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] oh, yes.
L:  It's like that in England, it's like that in France, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they -- except for the, you know, the big cities -- Paris, London, mostly there's a city and then there's the rural area and there really aren't any suburbs at all.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's so true.
L:  [MN] As a matter of fact, I was talking to a friend of mine who was born in China and she said that was the thing that freaked her out the most when she moved here [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- suburbs! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Why, why would it ...? [LAUGH]
L:  She just said, you know, that, that she never even thought about the idea of having sp- -- living space.
R:  Oh my gosh [LAUGH].
L:  As a matter of fact she -- her parents were doctors and they had an apartment right in the hospital.
R:  On my gosh, yeah, they -- even in Singapore they do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, in Japan you sort of live with all your coworkers and work in the same building.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I can't imagine life like that [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]  It'd be like being in the military or something.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think it helps to get away from where one lives -- to live -- you know, to drive away from work, or, um, and to be your -- in different surroundings as well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and amongst different people -- than always live in the same area.
L:  [MN] So, where are you from originally?
R:  From Kenya.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, yeah, we have suburbs there [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I can't relate to city living [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Lots of -- lots of suburbs, lots of huge rur- rural areas, farmlands and -- it's very much like the US in that sense.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Ah, so what -- what brings you to the States?
R:  Ah, my husband, um, got a job here so -- I've been here now for about four years.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I haven't got the accent though, yet [LAUGH].
L:  Don't [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You have a lovely accent [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My husband was in the military for ah -- [MN] for seven years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and one of the horrible things about joining the military is that you get this -- that, that, that you often get this what they call serviceman's twang --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, a lot of the, the people in the military are from the south and a lot of the bases are in the south --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- so, you get people from all over the country and then they're kind of exposed to this southern um, accent, and then so they ha- have this sort of amalgamation of all the accents and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it sort of sounds like a southern accent as well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they call it serviceman's twang and it's a --
R:   [MN]
L:  -- really just an awful, awful sound [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  He managed to stay -- to be in the military for six years and he never lost his Missouri accent.
R:  Oh, wow [LAUGH].
L:  He moved to Boston and within a year he's sounding like us -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'm just like, "No, go back to sounding --" 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- like you were from Missouri, that was a much nicer accent" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny [LAUGH].  Yeah, I -- I've started using um, American words though, like store rather than shop --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or supermarket, um, and, and, um legal paper rather than A four so I've started losing those words --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But not the accent, yet.
L:  [LAUGH] And of course a lot of my [MN] Indian coworkers use all the, the British -- what we consider to be British words as well, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Laboratory --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- that's my favorite.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Advertisement [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  It's funny because it's the same language, I mean, it's English in both places, but there are so many words that are uniquely English, or uniquely American.
L:  Mm, and there's a lot that are uniquely Indian as well [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  Sometimes you get a couple of Indians together -- they're speaking English, but you can't understand what they're talking about.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] [MN] 
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh well [MN], cultural imperialism at its best I guess, like --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- took what the -- what the British gave them and turned it around to something that was all their own.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
