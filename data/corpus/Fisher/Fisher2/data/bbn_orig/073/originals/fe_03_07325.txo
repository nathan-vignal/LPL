L:  Hi, I'm Lisa from Minnesota.
R:  Hi, I'm Barb from New York.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you today?
L:  I'm good, thank you.
R:  Great [MN].
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  Yeah -- I -- twice.
L:  Okay yeah, me too, this is my third one [LAUGH].
R:  Me too, me too [LAUGH].
L:  So, illness --
R:  Yes.
L:  Hm, do you get --
R:  Do you usually go to the doctor?
L:  Well, I try not to [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you?
R:  Ah, I wait until the last possible second [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, yeah, me too, I'm actually going to the doctor today.
R:  Oh no [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah, um, yeah, and I've waited for about six months --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I should probably go, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But um, it's -- it kind of sounds like they want a -- they were getting at allergies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You think?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you have allergies?
R:  I don't have allergies.
L:  I don't either -- my son does, really bad in the fall --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and we're in Minnesota and it's just -- I don't know -- I don't even, I don't understand it -- just the pollen and everything -- he can't even barely go outside.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yeah, he's fourteen now and it's actually -- it's actually starting to clear up -- I mean, it's not as bad, I mean when he was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when he was little it was eye drops and the whole nine yards and it was just -- bam, a freak out day to hurry and get to the doctor because it just was so sudden --
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah, but he -- I don't know, he's kinda -- he must be growing out of it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I  -- I guess that's probably possible.
R:  Uh-huh, yes, yes.  My daughter is nine years old --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she had real bad -- well, first when she was six months old they said she had asthma, and then they called it reactive airway disease --
L:  What's that?
R:  -- and, and allergies, and she would get -- it -- depending on what she came in contact with that she was allergic to she would get really, really sick and her lungs would all fill up with fluid --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and you know, she would be in the hospital and they always told me that with time she would outgrow it and it's amazing, because slowly but surely she has, and she hasn't been hospitalized since she was six, so [MN] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so --
L:  Well, that's good.  
R:  -- I guess that is true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I blame it on -- I live right by Kodak and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, I swear it's the pollutants in the air because so many kids here in this Rochester[?] area have been diagnosed with reactive airway diseases --
L:  Really?
R:  -- you know when they're babies and -- and they just put so many pollutants into the air [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   -- all the time, I swear it has something to do with that.
L:  Has there been -- has there been stuff done -- research?
R:  No, oh no, and Jessica, my daughter, she's been through, um, different programmes through the University of Rochester because I voiced concerns and they monitored her --
L:  Really?
R:  -- for three years and the last -- the three years that they did monitor her on a monthly basis --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, she -- her -- everything was clearing up, it was finally like, you know, she was not having problems all the time, but with Jessica the thing was, was as soon as she started coughing you had to get her to the doctor, like, within hours --
L:  Really.
R:  -- or she would get so sick --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and what they would do is they would put her on steroids to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- keep the inflammation in her lungs down, but --
L:  God.
R:  -- yeah, yeah, but um --
L:  Wow, that's harsh.
R:  -- yeah, yeah, but --
L:  Wow, so it, ah -- is that your only daughter?
R:  No, I -- I have two boys --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and both of them are fine, they never had any problems, but our next door neighbor had a little girl who had the same problem and, just you know --
L:  It's Kodak [LAUGH].
R:  -- you -- you seriously [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, man.
R:  You know they're moving out of the area, and everyone's all sad and I think, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  You're like, "Rock on -- get out". 
R:  It's probably better for the environment, you know.
L:  Please, let's have a party [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Well, I guess ah, it -- [MN] we really -- well my, my son has, er, and this is really, it's actually freaky -- he's got -- it's called -- ah, it's called leggcalve pertts disease-- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's spelt L.E.G.G.C.A.L.V.E. --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- P.E.R.T.T.S., but there's only one in ten thousand boys between the ages of four and seven that are diagnosed, and usually you are not dia- -- the chances are you're not diagnosed [MN], or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the ratio is like one in thirty visits -- it would -- it would take you thirty to get diagnosed.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And it's -- it -- have you heard of it?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Oh, I was going to say -- oh my god, I have never --
R:  Uh-huh, no.
L:  -- I don't know anybody who ever has, but um, yeah, so he was, oh what was Christopher -- he was six, six years old and ah, he was a bl -- he was a advanced red belt in Tai Kwan Do and he was, you know, saying, "Oh my, my knee hurts" and he was telling me behind his knee --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- and I thought, "Well, you need to stretch out better", so it, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's just what I thought -- he'd pulled a muscle -- he was a good, he was very good at, you know, Tai Kwan Do, and he was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, this -- this goes on for like about a week and I don't really notice him, you know, moaning and that -- that bad --
R:  Right.
L:  -- well, one day he comes home -- ah, right after he had left to get on the bus for school and he came back in the door and he was just crying, and I said, "What's the matter?", and he said, "I missed the bus" -- well, I'm like, "What?", because I hadn't really even noticed it, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And I thought, "Well, what the -- what's going on here?" -- I -- I needed to -- I had to call school 'cause I thought if this is that bad that he missed the bus, and I had -- [MN] -- is he faking this? Does he just wanna stay home today? --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, what is this?  So, I called school and I said, "Has anybody noticed anything?" da da da, I br-, actually took him in the car, I brought him up there, I mean, the bus driver seen him walking down the road and just kept going so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was just pissed, you know?  And I'm just like, "Whatever man", so I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I took him up to school and the nurse is like, "Well, he, you know -- he -- he's mentioned a couple of times and we've let him sit out for gym", "Well, hello, why didn't you call me?"
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, duh, and ah, so I -- actually it's a good thing that we had a really, really good pediatric surg- -- pediatric doctor at the time -- I wish the guy was still here but he,  he transferred over to Chicago --
R: Uh-huh.
L:  -- but ah, I called him up and I started telling him what was going on and he says, "Well, Lisa, you know what?", he says "It's really ironic", he said, "I just went to a conference ..." da, da, da, da, da and he's like, "And I, I really think you guys need to go down to children's hospital right now and -- and -- and I'm gonna call down there and I'll tell you who I'm going to have meet, meet you there", and I'm like "What -- what are you talking about?", you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he -- he said "Well, I think I know what -- what's going on", and I'm like, "Well, what do you mean, yeah, pulled muscle?", you know I mean -- I --
R:   Right, right, right.
L:  -- so now I'm -- he's getting me freaked out because we're going to the children's hospital -- you know where I'm at --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- we got issues now, so -- yeah, we get down there and ah, I -- I -- I totally did not expect, I mean what was to happen next, um, it was just me and Christopher there and he -- he -- he was this lit- -- my, my active boy, you know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- riding a bike, climbing trees, and, and, and -- and this -- a couple of doctors come in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and leave and -- and, and, and then they tell me that they think they should take me outside of the room and I said, "No, I think whatever you need to say to me, you can say in front of my son" --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know  -- "It's -- it's him --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- what the hell is going on here?".  Well, they tell me he has leggcalve pertts disease and what happens with that and it's -- I mean it's so, so rare I could not find -- and I, to this day I've only found one other person in the five state area --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- that I could talk to, yeah, about it -- a parent --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and she had a baby -- but what happened was she had to go through the next three years, um, they put him in these brace -- well, immediately they put him in a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a body ca- -- I mean [MN] -- traction --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and he was in the hospital for three weeks, then he had to go into these braces, like Forrest Gump type and they were to- -- I -- they told me it was going to be two years that he was going to have to wear it -- I'm just like, "What?" --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I mean this is, yeah, I -- I was freaking out and so was he and, the braces didn't work -- go over well so he had to have um, what the heck was that -- ah, femoral osteotomy[?] what -- what happens is the -- the hip joint, you know how --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- your hips curve in --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, well, one of h- -- one of his ah, hip joints had actually -- w- -- was fractured in three spots by the time they x rayed it that day --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because what happens is the bone, the bone loses blood su- -- it loses blood, the blood supply --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it just stops and it goes out of the socket and goes just wacko within a matter of days.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  Yeah, and -- and I'm just like "What are you do- ...", -- I'm, I'm --
R:  Exactly, talk about overwhelming.
L:  -- yeah, exactly and, and, and all of a sudden my kid who does all this --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and all that, can't do anything --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for -- for how many years? Wh-, what's, you know, and it --
R:  Holy cow.
L:  -- yeah, it was freaky and then the um, the braces didn't work, I mean he'd take 'em off and go, "I'm not wearing these" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, and he was just bad --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- I mean he was pulling his hair out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it was -- literally -- and it was so terrible and so I said, you know I went back to the orthopedic surgeon, I said, "You know, this isn't going to work" --
R:  Right.
L:  "What are my other options?", I mean there were huge, huge, huge risks with this surgery --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I had to opt for the surgery because it was the -- it w- -- I -- we couldn't live like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:   We really couldn't -- I mean, he had -- he was pulling his hair out --
R:  [MN] Wow.
L:  -- he had clumps of hair in his hand.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, 'cause he couldn't take what was happening --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- watching his friends play and da, da, da, da, da -- see I had this femur osteotomy, then was in a body cast for three months --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- then [inaudible] -- during that surgery they put a plate in his hip and, oh, blah, blah, blah -- but two years later finally we got it all ended -- the plate came out and -- amazing, you cannot even see the scar to this day.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, that was seven years -- well, it's seven years ago he had the surgery, yeah -- in -- seven years ago in January it was.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, that was just a trip -- I mean, and he still goes to the doctor now every year for a check up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wow, this is a good conversation 'cause it took up our ten minutes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  But ah, yeah, he still goes to the doctor once a year for a check up and -- and they're learning more stuff every year --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- there -- there's not that many kids that have it --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and they still can't, you know, I asked Dr Sundberg[?] every time we go in there, "So, what else can you tell me about this -- do you know anything?", you know? --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they, well, you know, "Well, we've learned a little more about the lack of blood supply in the hip joint, and -- and the ball, the ball joint of the ...", you know, and I'm like, "Uh-huh, and what else?" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and -- and -- and yeah, 'cause there was nothing they c- -- there was nothing, there wasn't even a pamphlet --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- a brochure, and I said --
R:  That's scary.
L:  -- "Well, how -- where did you come up with this name?" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "Where did you it ...", you know, he was like, "The name was, was made by a Dr Legg, Dr Calve and Dr Pertts, the three ..." --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, and I was like, "Really?".
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah, all I got to read about was them three doctors --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- back in the olden day.
R:  Right.
L:  But yeah, it was just -- it was enormous [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
