L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  This is Bill.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Ah, my name is Bill.
R:  Uh-huh.   Do you know, I --
L:  Um --
R:  -- couldn't understand what she said the topic is?
L:  Something about illness.
R:  Illness?  Okay.
L:  [MN] The question was, ah, do people get sick [NOISE] [PAUSE] -- [MN] do people get sick when the seasons change -- ah, when the season -- ah, the seasons change.
R:  Well, I think sometimes.  But, I think it has more to do with maybe the weather than it does --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just the season change.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Yeah, I would agree with that. [NOISE] I would -- well, I -- I've noticed, ah, people don't eat their vegetables in the wintertime.  They don't eat, like, fresh fruits and vegetables. [NOISE] 
R:  Ah, you're talking to the wrong person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I do and my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family does, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- always have.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  
R:  And I work in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a school cafeteria and -- and really work on the nutrition part of it.  So, we do.
L:  That's good.  I always -- I always eat lots of vitamin C -- [PAUSE] vitamin C and, ah, beta carotene. [PAUSE] 
R:  Well, it's important. [PAUSE] 
L:  I think ev- every morning I have something like a grapefruit or something, you know, [PAUSE] or at least an orange. [PAUSE]  I've actually gone to, like, people's trees and, it's like, asked them if it -- I can have some fruit. [NOISE]  [PAUSE] 
R:  Well now, if -- if you're talking about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- flu and flu season [PAUSE] -- are you there?
L:  Yeah, I'm still here.
R:  I -- I -- when you say seasons I think of summer, winter, spring and fall.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm -- yeah, that's what I was talking about.
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, sometimes the flu season, it doesn't necessarily fall in spring, or winter, or -- it can fall in winter -- spring, you know, right at the -- in both of 'em.  It can be a long season of -- of flu cases.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  In Tulsa, Oklahoma.
L:  Oh, okay.  Out here on the west coast -- so, it's like, springtime comes early.  It's almost, like, ah, from late February -- early March.
R:  Yeah. [COUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If, ah -- our -- our flu season usually begins January.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But then, we have -- it depends on what type of flu you're talking about, because we flus that -- that happen in the fall. [PAUSE]  So, Oklahomans can get sick any time they [LAUGH] -- they get ready to.
L:  Oh.  And you have tornados too.
R:  Yes, we do.
L:  Yeah. [MN] [PAUSE] 
R:  Never have been in, but I've helped clean up -- clean up after one. [PAUSE]  So, I have a great deal of respect for 'em.
L:  Yeah, I ha- [MN] -- they had, ah, some really bad ones this year.  Was that in Oklahoma?  Or was that in -- up north -- north of you?
R:  What?  The -- the recent tornados?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [MN] More that we've -- than we've ever had in the history of Oklahoma.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, ah -- and -- ones that caused a great deal of damage, and ones that hit in the same places that hit before.  That --
L: Wow.
R:  -- whole thing was -- was historic.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  So --
L:  -- saw the photos in the paper, like -- it's, like, total devastation. [NOISE]
R:  I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
L:  [NOISE] Um, yeah, [MN] I could never -- is it -- weather been more unstable there this year?
R:  It has.  We haven't had a bad winter.  We did have, ah -- ah, some pretty good snow this last year, which was, ah, nice.  But, it wasn't, um -- I think school was closed for, like, three days --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- which is no big deal.  But -- and it wouldn't have to be bad, except that you can't take the chance on even one child being hurt because their parents had to drive 'em to school.  I work for a private school so, um, we don't have buses that are bringing 'em.  It's their parents.  And, um, sometimes they just won't take 'em if the weather's bad at all.  So, the -- you know, if you don't have enough kids at school, there's not any point in having it.  So, a lot of times that's the reason why it gets -- it gets closed.
L:  Yeah, I can understand that. Like, what's the point? [PAUSE] [NOISE] 
R:  What kind of illnesses were -- were you talking about?
L:  Ah, they [MN] --
R:  Just general illnesses?
L:  Yeah, they weren't specific.  They were just, like, ah, c- -- I think they mentioned colds.  They said -- the question was a cold will last seven days, and if you go to the doctor it'll last ten. [PAUSE] 
R:  Well, if you treat it right away, it lasts five. 
L:  I think prevention is the best thing personally.
R:  Well, I think, ah, lots of liquids and vitamins helps a whole bunch.
L:  Yeah, like vitamin C.
R:  A lot of vitamin C.
L:  I wouldn't -- a lot of doctors prescribe, ah, anti- antibiotics, which is --
R:  Well, only if you have an infection that can't be handled by -- ah, you know, no antibiotics should be prescribed unless it's for a bacterial infection.
L:  Right.  I think they -- a lot of them mistakenly prescribe it.
R:  Well, I think that -- that the pub- general public has overtaken --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- antibiotics.
L:  Yeah, I would agree with that. [PAUSE] 
R:  But, and -- [MN] they -- you know, you build up an immunity to 'em, which --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- is what happened with my husband.  He just -- he had emphysema, and he had got bronc- -- had chronic bronchitis that went into pneumonia.  And they were giving him some pretty powerful antibiotics, but they just didn't work.  There'd been too many times of -- of bronc- bronchitis that -- that it just was beginning to be untreatable.  And -- and we lost him.
L:  Wow.  I'm sorry to hear that.
R:  So, it's -- um, you know, there are illnesses, and there are illnesses.  And some of 'em [PAUSE] I -- I wonder if there'd be different ways to treat 'em.  I don't know what we would do without antibiotics, because we've come to rely on 'em so much.  But --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- ah, then, people used to die at a lot younger age too --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- before the antibiotics.
L:  But, we used to live in a, you know, wor- -- we have better hygiene now than we did, ah, you know, earlier. [PAUSE]  I think people are a little bit more, ah, aware of taking precautions.
R:  Well, I don't know that -- people now to keep themselves healthy -- think they have to belong to some gym and work out all the time, where in the past to keep yourself healthy was just -- came along with -- with whatever you was do- -- because people worked harder.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They worked harder as farmers and as, ah, laborers -- any part of it, they worked harder.  And they built their bodies up to -- that helped 'em fight off illnesses.
L:  That's true.
R:  So now, I don't know how much good it does to have the -- the six pack, or how much -- to -- to have the muscles in your arms if it doesn't -- if it's not the good constitution that you need in the first place to help you fight off illness.
L:  Yeah, that's right.  Peop- -- they have to work out -- you know, people would need to work -- do more aerobic exercise -- work their heart.
R:  You know, and I've -- I had a friend with the heart thing that ran, and he even gave lectures on running for your life.  And he dropped dead running one day.
L:  No kidding?  How --
R:  So --
L:  -- old was he?
R:  -- ah, you can't -- you know, I know there are always exceptions, and I know that exercise is better than -- than sitting.  But, it's not the whole answer.  It -- it's just -- it's just not.  There's a combination of a lot of things.  And illnesses don't necessarily mean somebody's gonna die.  But, if they do [PAUSE] -- I don't know -- they just -- they just need to take care of themselves in the first place.
L:  Yeah.  A lot of people need to change their lifestyle, you know, if --
R:  Yep.
L:  It's -- it's not just eating, ah, a couple of vegetables and then, you know, taking a couple of vitamins.  A whole way of life that they have to look at everything they're doing.
R:  And lose some of that weight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if you've been out looking around lately, but [MN] --
