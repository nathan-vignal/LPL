L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  I'm Bill.
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Beverley.
L:  Beverley?
R:  Yes.  And I live in Canada.
L:  Okay.  And I'm in New York City.
R:  Okay.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good -- good.
L:  You wanna go ahead and start?
R:  Okay.  I think the topic is, ah, something about the seasons and do you get sick when the seasons change, and ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  And how do you keep well.
L:  Right. 
R:  Well, ah, I try to eat well, and I don't smoke and I -- I don't drink, and, ah, try to get enough sleep, and -- don't get as much exercise as I'd like to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, you know, I just try to -- to do things that, ah, wouldn't hinder my health as --as much as I -- you know, to the best of my knowledge.  And, um, I --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- don't really -- I can't say I get sick when the seasons change.  I know some people think that that happens, but, ah, I don't know.  I don't --
L:  Well, I -- I --
R:  -- really true --
L:  -- think --
R:  -- or not.
L:  I think, ah, when the seasons change it does spur some type of sickness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I don't think it has anything to do with actually catching a cold.  I think it has more to do with, you know, the peop- -- the way people's moods are --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and -- and -- 
R:  That's
L:  -- they way --
R:  -- possible.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, I think, um -- I think sometimes, um, you know when winter sets on that's possible, depending where you live I guess.  Where we live, you know, it can be pretty long winter, or a miserable winter.  Um, I think more the weather has some -- I would say more than the seasons, I would say the weather, you know, has something to do with how people feel.
L:  Right. 
R:  Whether --
L:  And -- and --
R:  -- or not -- you know, it depends when you say, um, if you don't feel well.  Like, ah, to what extent is that, you know, do you don't -- not feel well?  Do you feel not well physically, or not well emotionally, or -- you know?  
L:  Right.  Have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Having moved from -- from Florida actually, ah --
R:  From where?
L:  From Florida.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  A --
R:  So --
L:  -- couple -- couple of years ago.  It --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- took me a long time to get used to the weather, and --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and the winter.  And just getting out of bed in the morning I know that's -- that's been a change[?] --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- for me --
R:  See, so you would've --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- experienced something like that, whereas I never would have had, you know.  Yeah.  So, like, I can see where, yeah, that would make-- that would make some difference.  But, how --
L:  Well, I mean --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Go ahead -- go ahead.
R:  How do you keep yourself well as -- you know, as much as you can?
L:  Well, during the winter especially I try to do a lot more exercise.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I find that when I'm out of shape that, you know, my -- my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's easy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for me to just be susceptible to the different changes.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  So, I just try to exercise a lot more.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- I don't eat very healthy, but --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- I guess it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- makes up for it --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- somehow.
R:  Yeah.  Do you --
L:  How 'bout --
R:  -- have --
L:  How 'bout -- how 'bout in terms of, [MN] um, seeing your doctor?  How often --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- maybe 
R:  -- I --
L:  -- do -- 
R:  -- I go for regular check ups, but, you know, I -- I'm -- I don't go unless [LAUGH] there's really something troubling me.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have children -- well, they're -- they're grown now.  But, it was the same with them.  You know, I took them for their regular check ups, but I -- I wasn't running to the doctor all the time.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not unless it was, you know, really, really essential.  And I don't believe on -- in going on medications and antibiotics and all that unless you really, really have to.
L:  Right.  And I -- and I --
R:  I don't think --
L:  -- agree.
R:  -- they do us any justice, you know.
L:  Right.  I agree in that respect.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't -- I'm not a big proponent of medicine either --
R:  No.  Do you --
L:  -- unless --
R:  Do yo take vitamins?
L:  I do take vitamins.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So do I -- a multi vitamin.  And -- and I'm over fifty, so I take calcium.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  But, other than that, you know, I've -- I'm fortunate that I do.  I -- I just need more exercise.  I mean, I really know I need more exercise.
L:  Hm.
R:  And I think it's something you have to -- you have to discipline yourself to do, or you'll just let it slide.  And the older you get the harder it is to -- to get --
L:  Right.
R:  -- going at it.
L:  I know one thing living in -- in -- in the city, it's -- it's easier, because you have to walk everywhere.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  Whereas in Florida I -- I had to drive around, so I didn't get enough exercise.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, here, ah, you -- you get enough exercise with stairs and everything else.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  I was just in Illinois.  My daughter lives in Illinois.  And they live in the country.  And, ah, I was taking their children every day, twice a day, walking down to the end of the road.  And I thought, "Oh man, this is good.  I need to do this more often".
L:  Right. 
R:  I was pushing the stroller, which made it, you know, even a little bit more strenuous.  And I thought, "When I get home I gotta keep this up".
L:  Right. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Mm.
R:  So, ah, do you have a family?
L:  Ah, I don't have a family.  I'm actually a student.  And --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in down town Manhattan.  But, ah, yeah, it's -- it's been a -- definitely been a change --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- in environment for me.  And, ah --
R:  So, did you find -- did you get colds over the winter? Or --
L:  Yeah, very cold. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Very cold.
R:  But, did you -- but, did you get a c- -- you know, did you -- did you get a cold, or a any kind --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- any kind --
L:  I didn't get a cold.
R:  So, you didn't get colds?
L:  No.  I have a pretty, um, strong immune system, so that it --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Ah, and in fact, I can't even remember the last time I caught a cold.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I've got a cold right now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I was baby sitting my little granddaughter and she had one, and I think she passed it on to me.  But, I hadn't had a cold for a long, long time.  
L:  Mm.
R:  But, it's not too bad.  But, the thing that seems to be not good these days -- I don't know about where you are, but up here in our area there's a lot of viruses that go around that are --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and they don't -- you know, the doctors can't treat them properly.  And -- and they hang on, and they hang on.  And --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- I think, ah -- I don't know whether that's just a sign of the times or what, you know.  Or --
L:  Ah, I'm sh- --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, I'm sure it is a sign of the --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- times, but that's one thing that I've learned to do is not -- not give that too much attention --
R:  No.
L:  -- or else it'll rule -- you know, rule your life --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- if you --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- pay attention to it.
R:  I agree.  Yeah, it's true.  I agree.  Yeah, a lot of -- um, a lot of your wellness can be -- depend on how you think.  And, ah, you know, if you're dwelling on health problems or health problems you think you have --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- a lot of times, you know, it's -- it's better to -- to be positive than -- and try to not to -- I don't know -- I guess it depends on the type of person you are.  But, ah, I don't think about getting sick and fortunately I've been blessed with good health so far.
L:  Right. 
R:  And, ah, I'm thankful for that.
L:  Mm.
R:  So -- but, I don't know.  Was -- was there another question?  I can't remember what the girl said when she --
L:  There's something about, ah, yeah, if you get a cold and you don't go to the doctor --
R:  Yeah.  No, I don't --
L:  -- but then --
R:  -- get a -- I don't go to the doctor for a cold, unless --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it hangs --
L:  It sounds ridiculous, doesn't it, to --
R:  Yeah. I -- I --
L:  -- go to the doctor for a cold?
R:  The only time I did was a number of years ago and I actually got a -- I got a virus.  It was one of these viruses that hung on for three months.  And they really couldn't give me anything for it.  But, it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- turned into infection, and --
L:  [MN] Okay.
R:  Yeah.  And that I found broke down my resistance, and I found that every time I got a cold after that I was really sick.  And [MN] it actually [MN] -- it was a couple of years before I kind of broke that cycle.  So, you know -- and I'm not -- I'm not one for -- when I get sick I usually can get over it pretty fast, and I don't baby myself.  I just, you know, keep --
L:  Really?
R:  -- going.  And -- but, that was something that hit me a couple of years ago, and it -- but, they said it was viral and -- but, normally I don't -- you know, I don't go to the doctor for a cold.  I -- I think that's a waste of time -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and a --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- waste of, you know, our government's money. [LAUGH]  Oh, and --
L:  It's a waste --
R:  -- our health --
L:  -- of a lot --
R:  -- insurance.
L:  -- of resources I think.
R:  Pardon?
L:  I said it's a waste of a lot of resources.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  But --
R:  And yeah --
L:  -- I guess --
R:  -- I know some people that, you know, they -- they do, especially with children.  They run to the doctor for everything.  And it's -- when I was bringing up my children in particular -- ah, I mean, our health care here in Canada is -- ah, we all pay an awful lot for it.  And it got abused because people were running to the doctor.  When I was bringing my children up I had friends that would run to the doctor with their children for every little thing, and I just didn't see the point of that.  You know, unless it was an infection -- an ear infection or something like that you just had to run with it and let -- get over it. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I -- I imagine that it's a bit different though with kids because --
R:  Yeah, it is -- it is, because, ah, you know, I mean, you don't want your children to suffer, and so you don't sit by let them suffer needlessly.  But, on the other hand, there's some type of illnesses that children have that's just gotta run it's cycle.  They pick them up at school.  They pick them up from their friends.  Um, and there's not a whole lot -- there's no sense putting them on antibiotics for, you know, a cold or something. They just -- it's gotta run its course.
L:  Right.
R:  It's part of life when you're --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when you're bringing up kids.  Yeah.
L:  And that -- their immune system can build up that defence --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.  And I don't know what it's like down in the States, but here in Canada they say we've -- we've, um, overused antibiotics.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, ah, you know, people have used them too much, and too long.  And so, now doctors are thinking twice before they -- you know, if you run to the doctor needlessly they won't necessarily put you on an antibiotic because [NOISE] they gave out too many for too long --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- in cases [NOISE] where they shouldn't have given them out.  So [NOISE] -- anyway, I don't know.  Our ten minutes should be up soon.  I don't know what else I can think of saying --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- as far as -- what kind of exercising do you do?
L:  I do --
R:  Walking?  Or --
L:  -- quite a bit of running actually.
R:  Running?
L:  Yeah.
