L:  I don't want to just like sit there and ah, you know, not have anybody to talk to while I'm waiting for the food.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just like last month I went to San Diego -- 
L:  Mm.

L:  Just more fun [inaudible].
R:  Ah, yeah, but, ah, usually when you go to restaurant what kind of restaurant ah did you go, I mean, just like a, ah, um, like buffet, or a restaurant or something?
