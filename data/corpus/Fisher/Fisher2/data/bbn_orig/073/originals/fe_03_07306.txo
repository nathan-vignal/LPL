L:  So, uh -- uh, Brookline.
R:  Brooklyn, New York?
L:  Brookline, Massachussetts.
R:  [MN]  Oh, Brookline, Massachussetts.  Oh, wow.  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  Yeah.  We're --
L:  Okay.  
R:  -- pretty far away, huh?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Away.  About -- about as far away as you can get, I guess, unless you live in Hawaii or something like that.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, uh --
L:  [MN]  Eating in restaurants versus at home.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, probably, well, I'm more of like a drive through guy.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh.  Yeah, I go through the drive throughs.  Uh, uh, well, you know, to the fast food primarily is what I -- what I pretty much live on.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I have a McDonalds around the corner I go to all the time.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, McDonalds, Burger King, um, Wendys.
L:  Kentucky [LAUGH] Fried Chicken.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN]  Kentucky Fried Chicken, um, [inaudible], uh --
L:  Uh --
R:  Taco Bell.  
L:  I -- I still do eat at home a lot 'cause it's cheaper.  And 'cause it tastes [inaudible].
R:  Is it +really?  It's cheaper to eat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at home, you think?
L:  To get groceries and cook 'em yourself.  Yeah.  'Cause you get like groceries for a week for, like, you know, forty five dollars.  You go out to dinner and lunch and breakfast all week and it's --
R:  Oh, that.  Well, yeah, that adds up.
L:  It's a lot more. 
R:  Especially if you go to a sit down place.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean, you can get by pretty cheap on, like, say if you go to, you know, uh, order off the value menu or something.  You know, if you get, like, a, the ninety nine cent stuff.
L:  Yeah.  But it's not as good for [LAUGH] you.
R:  It's not -- no, it's not good for you but, I mean, it's if you're in a hurry and you're hungry and --
L:  Yeah, in a pinch. 
R:  In a pinch.  And whatever.
L:  In a [LAUGH] pinch.  [inaudible].
R:  In -- in -- whatever.
L:  I like -- I like not having to do dishes.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's [LAUGH] better[?].  
R:  And clean up afterwards.  
L:  And clean up.
R:  And then --
L:  Clean up for McDonalds is, like, throw the box away.  
R:  Yeah.  And then, um, and then cooking at home too is, um, um, you get the odor in the house.
L:  Yeah, but I like that actually.
R:  Oh, do you?  Do you?
L:  Do -- if you cook something --
R:  I don't like that.
L:  -- nice.  I stopped cooking fish.
R:  Did -- yeah, well --
L:  'Cause that --
R:  -- depending on what it is. 
L:  [MN]
R:  Like me and chick- chicken something like real potent, like, with garlic, whatever, and then you gotta open the windows and it takes like a day, a whole day or two, for the odor to get out.  That's -- that's what I -- I don't really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that too much but ...  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I used to be a vegetarian and so I could never go out to restaurants 'cause, like, there's [MN] there's no where that is just vegetarian.
R:  Oh, you're a veg?  My sister's a veg, yeah.
L:  Not anymore.  [LAUGH]  It's too difficult and I'm in school now so ...
R:  Oh, I suppose, yeah.  That's really hard.
L:  Yeah.  The -- I eat lunch definitely at school.  I don't bring that from home.  
R:  Oh, you're in college?
L:  In law school, yeah.
R:  Oh, you're in law school?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  What do you do?
R:  I do marketing research.  Over --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the internet.
L:  So this is perfect for you?
R:  Uh, kind of, yeah.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's, uh, yeah, it's just something extra, you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is actually my third -- will be my third call.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  So --
R:  -- everyb- -- it's funny, because everyone I talked to is, um, one -- one person was from Maine, and one was from Vermont, and you're from Massachussetts.  So it's all New -- New England calls.
L:  Yeah.  This is my first call.  
R:  Oh, is it y- your first call, yeah?
L:  This is my first call.  
R:  [MN]
L:  But, um, so food.  [LAUGH]  Food.  I don't know.  Um, yeah, restaurants just get too expensive.  You can spend, like, twenty dollars each meal at least.
R:  Oh, easy.
L:  You -- you --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- got out with somebody else or you go out, like on a Friday night, and you're waiting in line for half an hour and -- it's relaxing to cook though.  Sometimes.  Especially when, like, people are coming over or something like that --
R:  If you're not in a hurry or something, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  And I cook at home sometimes.  Uh, I used to cook a lot more but now I got -- kind of got lazy or something.  So ...
L:  Do you live alone?
R:  Yeah, I do now.  I used to --
L:  'Cause that's -- that's also the worst.  Like sh- -- grocery shopping for one.  I do that.  
R:  Oh, you don't like to?
L:  [inaudible] just --
R:  I find it [MN] --
L:  No.  It's easier if you live like in a --
R:  It's easier.
L:  -- in a houseful.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  No, no, no, with more people.  Because then, like, your groceries don't all spoil by the time you want to cook something. 
R:  Right.  
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  I don't know.  I -- I sh- -- well, I -- I shop when I go to the shop -- like the grocery store I just -- I don't buy much.  It's alw- -- I go frequently but I don't buy much.  Like I don't go, like, all out -- I just don't go, like, once every few weeks and then buy a whole bunch of stuff.  [MN] 
L:  Well, in L.A. you probably have a car.
R:  'Cause it'll -- yeah, I got a car.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't have a car so --
R:  'Cause it'll --
L:  -- I have to go, like, once a month.
R:  'Cause, uh, 'cause it'll all go bad.  You know.
L:  Mm.  Exactly.
R:  Especially if it's --
L:  Now --
R:  -- fresh produce or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Now I just -- well, there's a -- a fruit and vegetable place by me so I get that.  And then I just go and get, like, all the prepackaged stuff and, you know.  Yeah.  Living alone I just feel like I live off a like Easy Mac.  [LAUGH]  And Ramen noodles and --
R:  Oh, a lot of, uh --
L:  That's --
R:  A lot of, um, pasta?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things like that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  High in carbs, huh?
L:  I never order pasta when I go out to a [LAUGH]  restaurant.  That -- 'cause I'm like, "Oh, I make that at home too much".  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  [MN]  Well, it's easy to make.  Pasta.  That's what I do.  I make, like, spaghetti a lot.  And, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like simple things.  Mac and cheese where I add chili.  Uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- steak.  Once -- once in a great while.  I don't eat that much steak.  Not to -- I try not to eat too much red meat, you know.
L:  You get to grill all the time in L.A.
R:  It's what?
L:  You can pro- -- you can, like, grill outside all the time.
R:  Outside.  Yeah.  It's pretty, uh, yeah, the weather's pr- pretty permitting here.  It really is.  It's -- it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's pretty nice I'll have to admit.
L:  We have barbecues in the summertime out here.  It's nice.  
R:  Barbecues?  Oh, yeah.  
L:  And for the Boston Marathon we always barbecue.  
R:  Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  Barbecues.  I haven't been to a barbecue in a long time.  And, uh, but there's always like -- there's always like, uh, you know, like the fast food places, again, are like always, like, they're open here all the time.  Twenty four hours.
L:  Yeah.  Boston shuts down pretty early.  
R:  So you -- uh, oh, do- does it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you -- so you can go there just virtually any time you want.  You know.  
L:  [MN]  [inaudible] 
R:  I -- when you just -- [MN] if you're hungry and you wake up and you just, you know, don't feel like cooking or whatever, you just z- zip on over to the Jack in the Box or, uh, McDonalds or whatever.
L:  I miss Jack in the Box.  We don't have that out here.
R:  No.  
L:  I used to live on --
R:  No, I guess you --
L:  -- on the west coast.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh, you got McDonalds.  All right.  E- everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- has McDonalds.  It's pretty much, uh, all over the world.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  Was that a bird?
L:  What?
R:  Was that a bird?
L:  Oh, no.  That was just my door.  
R:  Oh, your [LAUGH] door.  Sounds like a bird 'cause I used to have birds.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, and, uh, you could hear --
L:  No.
R:  -- 'em when you're talking on the phone.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So.  So what are you cooking tonight?
L:  I did.
R:  Anything?
L:  It's nine o'clock over here.  [inaudible].
R:  Oh, that's right.  It's like -- it's like, um, n- night.
L:  I [inaudible] cook dinner tonight.  
R:  So it's like --
L:  We had a --
R:  -- late over there.  Yeah.
L:  Nine fifteen.
R:  [MN]  It's only a little after six here.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Or something.
L:  Um, what did we cook tonight?  Um, chicken and Rama noodles and some rice.  And some fruit.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's easier than going out.  Well, not easier, but definitely cheaper.
R:  Definitely, a -- yeah, yeah, more economical when you're -- yeah, especially if -- if you're in school and you're -- you're on a budget.  You're trying to watch your spending I imagine.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- it's -- yeah.  It's -- its definitely -- definitely, uh, more reasonable.  Especially chicken and rice and, you know, stuff like that though, which is pretty cheap to buy.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  But, um, yeah, especially like if you go out for ice cream or something.  That's like three dollars for a scoop of ice cream and you get a whole pint for four dollars.
R:  It is.  
L:  Or something.
R:  Isn't that ridiculous.   
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  And then Subway too, sometimes, uh, Subway is -- is supposed to be, you know, everybody [MN] likes -- do you have Subway up there?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  They're just, actually, putting one up right near me.
R:  But -- but -- but they're such a -- uh, have you been there though?  Have you ever eaten ...?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  Everybody seems to want to go there but it's such a -- it's such a poor value.  I mean, because you pay, like, four dollars.  Four or five dollars for a, like, a -- not even a foot long, you get a ha- -- a six inch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it is just basically a loaf -- you know, it's a loaf of bread.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's it.  With a little bit of meat on it.  Just a tin- -- I mean, you know they got all the --
L:  Get the meatball subs.
R:  -- fresh ...  The what?
L:  The meatball subs.  
R:  Meatball subs.  Yeah.  
L:  Those are good and ...
R:  And, uh, you know, you get all the fresh stuff on it and all the -- you know, all the fi- -- uh, extras.  But --
L:  No, the meatball subs are just meatballs and bread.
R:  Oh, you don't --
L:  Those are [inaudible].
R:  You don't get all the other stuff on it?
L:  If you want, but I just like the meatballs and the [LAUGH] bread.
R:  Oh.  You think it's a good value though?
L:  I think it's all right.  I don't love Subway but ...
R:  Oh.  Okay.  
L:  That's not my fav- -- I like Kentucky Fried Chicken.  
R:  But then it's supposed to -- yeah, also they have that, you know, it -- where it's got --
L:  Boston market.  
R:  It's -- Boston -- you know, they -- they had those here.  They had a bunch of 'em here and they closed 'em all.  Which --
L:  Did they?
R:  -- really bummed me out 'cause I did -- I liked to go.  It was a little bit pricey.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I liked -- I -- I used to like to go there 'cause they had good food. 
L:  I used to work at one when I was in high school.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  It was -- it was good.  It was actually, like, clean and stuff so I would eat there.  
R:  It was, yeah.
L:  [inaudible].  
R:  They had 'em all over the place too.
L:  And it was like family food.  It wasn't like --
R:  It was family food.  It wasn't that -- yeah, the California health food gr- -- you know, grain and high in protein and all that, you know, stuff.  It was -- yeah, it was
