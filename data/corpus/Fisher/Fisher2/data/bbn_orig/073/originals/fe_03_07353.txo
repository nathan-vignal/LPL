R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Roger.
L:  Hi Roger, I'm Marilyn.
R:  What's your name?
L:  Marilyn.
R:  Marilyn.  Hi.
L:  Yes.
R:  Well [LAUGH] I guess --
L:  This is my first one so I'll be really not so good [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  What?
L:  This is my first call, so --
R:  Oh, well this is about my third, so --
L:  Oh great.
R:  -- okay, so I -- yeah, I think this is my -- well, maybe my fourth now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But anyway, ah, what we do is usually just talk about the topic, you know --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and discuss it back and forth --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, give your input as far as what you feel and so on, and ah, it seems to be that they want us to talk about the change of seasons and ah, how it affects your health, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, ah --
L:  Well, let me see, the change of seasons -- I live in Texas, so the change of season -- there isn't [LAUGH] that happens.  We have our changes in season maybe a day. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you don't get any real ah, seasons, to speak of, huh?
L:  No, although like, in the winter you may have some, but our temperature right now, it's ninety five degrees and it's going to be ninety five to a hundred all the way up until September or October, and then October may go down to ninety or eighty and you'll have a couple more hundred days, and December'll get fifties and a couple of seventies and eighties.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You live in the southern part kind[?] of Texas, huh?
L:  Yeah, I live in Austin.
R:  Yeah.  I live in Virginia.
L:  Really?  Where in Virginia?
R:  Ah, Roanoke Valley.
L:  Oh, I grew up in Virginia.
R:  South west corner of Virginia.
L:  I grew up in Danville, so I know exactly where you are.
R:  Yeah, okay, well -- but I grew up in New Jersey so, I mean, ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, I moved down here about ah, fourteen years ago, but, ah, as far as the change of seasons and what that does to the -- the, ah, health, ah, my personal opinion is people get sicker really in the winter.
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, basically -- and I used to think it was because there were just like, more viruses around like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then, ah, I know I heard it from a doctor but then I saw it on TV one time where they said it was actually due to that people are indoors more --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and being indoors, the ah, ah, the viruses actually get to ah, you know, once you -- once you ah, catch it, you just seem to hang on to it longer and not only that it's just that ah, ah, when you ah, ah, when you're outdoors, ah, you're in the air more so you don't catch things as much, but when you're indoors they say you catch it a lot easier and it just stays there.  So th- -- that's what I found out, so then in the winter time, of course, it makes it a lot -- lot more unhealthier than ah, the spring and summer and fall.
L:  More germs.  It's easier to spread the germs around.
R:  Yeah, yeah, to your close ones and so on because you're really around them closer in the winter time.
L:  Than when the air's circulating.  Exactly.  Specially when they're closed in like that.  I find that often and it's so much -- so easy to catch cold when everybody, it seems like everyone has them and it becomes a very -- very strange thing.  We don't -- like I said, I hardly ever get a cold, I have more, um, allergies.  The change of seasons really means you get more either hay fever or [inaudible] or um, things such as that, not so much -- if it's cold then it may turn into a respiratory infection or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not much more um, than that, at least I don't -- I haven't found that out.
R:  Yeah, now me personally, I don't get -- I don't get sick very easily, you know, I might catch a -- a cold maybe ah, maybe once or twice a year, if that.  And that's about it.  I don't really get sick that often --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so ah, but when I lived in Jersey, um, you know, the winter was a lot stronger there --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and ah, and I was a mailman so --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- when you're outdoors, you know, that was fine, but when you're indoors that's when ah, you really feel the weather, you know, when it hits you, I mean you just really feel the ah, like if you've got a cold it just seems to drag on, you know when you're out there more, down here, with the milder temperatures, I just, ah, you know, it seems like if you get a cold it pretty much just goes away, [inaudible] Doesn't last a long time.
L:  Yeah, I used to live in New Jersey as well.  I used to live in Osborne Park.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  It was very, very, very -- we did -- but my kids caught cold there quite often --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the seasons were much longer, it's just starting to get warm there right now and how you deal with it -- that's why we moved on down here. [LAUGH] It was so much easier to -- I don't want to be cold again.  I froze too many winters there, and I had to leave and so that's why I moved here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then the kids didn't have colds nearly as much any more or um, didn't have to deal with a lot of the other things that come with the weather changing, you know, the -- the cold, the sniffles, the allergies are worse here but they seem to be growing out of those and then um, I forget what else that's health related towards it, it seems like we exercise more here, because you can't do that much exercising -- do you -- are you a mailman there as well?
R:  I'm retired now.
L:  Oh, well that makes it a little bit easier, because I could im- --
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, I, ah, I did carry mail here for a while, and then ah, just retired so, not too long ago, so, ah, but now, when I was carrying mail outdoors, it -- you know, that's, like I said, healthier than being indoors working, you know, ah, but yeah, I moved down here to get away from the winters as well. [LAUGH] 
L:  You didn't move too far though, you must have had family there or something.
R:  No, no, I didn't know anybody here.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  It -- nah, I came down on my motorcycle [LAUGH] so, but, ah, but I got away from the area just 'cause, ah, well the cost of living was so high but then the weather itself, it -- it's just that ah, ah, you know, I'd rather have some change of seasons, but not just to the extremes that they have up there.
L:  I understand.
R:  So, that's why Virginia was just a happy medium really.  And I like the mountains, so, you know --
L:  Oh, beautiful mountains.  Beautiful mountains.  Well that's a good place to live, but I had to get away from there, so I went the other way. [LAUGH] My mom still lives there.  As a matter of fact I'll be coming there on fourth of July.
R:  Oh wow.  Okay.
L:  Well Danville is where I'll be going, not there, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it -- it's um, it's a good place, I mean, my mom, she's thinking about moving further south though, because she's thinking that the weather -- she's thinking of the weather affecting her, she says, like, it affects her arthritis --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so she's thinking about moving more to Florida, ah, somewhere a little bit more warm.  She doesn't like it in Texas because it's a little too hot.  So it -- it's amazing -- I don't feel like it's too hot [LAUGH] I love it here!
R:  Well, Florida's got the humidity so, yeah, you know, and that -- that can affect a lot of respiratory problems there.
L:  That's a good point.  I'll tell her that then because you know, the other -- not often -- well, she says that it gets really -- these last couple of winters there have been a little bit harder than she thought --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was a lot of rain and a lot of stuff and she ended up slipping and falling a little bit more than she would have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and she thinks -- some other places so, um, that's why she said I want to move. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you, and then, you know, the problem about moving, you know, a lot of people -- I remember when people used to move out to Arizona a lot --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- ah, for the healthy air.  Now, I have a friend that, ah, I used to ride a motorcycle with, and he's out in Arizona and he said that the air quality there -- the health is -- is worse than it is over on the east coast now, he said, because of the ah, everybody's trying to grow -- or else they have yards like they had over on the east coast --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- and so that's thrown off the -- the ecology there -- over there in the -- around Arizona, and so consequently, he says, the -- they're, ah, -- they're having to deal with a lot more ah, the weather is not, you know, it's getting more humid and things like that, where before it used to be like, a dry heat, so ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's thrown, like I said, thrown out the ecology, thrown off and everybody's health out there that moved out there to get away from all that has ended up having more allergies out there than they do on the east coast now.
L:  Oh, that's something new.  I had not heard that.
R:  Yeah, it really surprised me, you know, ah, he said it's just, he says it's amazing how many people are like, from the east coast or even the west coast, and they're out there trying to grow these yards in desert, and they'll have soil ah, you know, trucked in, and put soil down and then grow a yard --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and he said it's, you know, it's really thrown things off there so that, you know, their health -- but he had moved out there for his wife's health, it had gotten pretty bad, and ah, he moved up there many years ago and he said that ah, you know, that it would be good for her health, but now he -- he says he's going to end up having to move somewhere else.  He doesn't know where yet.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, ah, yeah, yeah, it really surprised me.
L:  Moving from Arizona just because of health and they're having more respiratory problems?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mm, that's unusual, I didn't know that.  I didn't know that the air had gotten that bad in Arizona.
R:  Yeah, yeah, he just said it's just because everybody moving there had changed the ecology, you know, the ecosystem there, and ah, that's causing the -- the respiratory problems and everything else there.
L:  That's --
R:  But ah, yeah, it's interesting. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's quite interesting, because you -- I -- I -- you know, Arizona's very hot and both sides of the c- -- you know, the mountains and the clear skies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [LAUGH] I'm just totally surprised as far as, you know, I didn't know that.
R:  I'm just going by what he said, so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I've never even been there, myself, so I wouldn't know.
L:  It's hot.  It's very very hot, very dry --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's very clear air and I -- I know people who do live out there and they've never complained about it but I -- but you know, what you say makes, you know, perfect sense with so many people moving there as well to get away -- get away from all the stuff that goes
