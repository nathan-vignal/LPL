R:  Hi, my name is Dawn.
L:  Hi, my name's Trent.
R:  Oh, okay.  So --
L:  Uh, res- -- uh, I guess I'd have to say, uh, my favorite place to eat would be restaurants.  I gu- guess, uh, 'cause I work in one [LAUGH] I guess I'm -- I favor it more.  
R:  Oh.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's kind of a toss up for me.  I -- I would say restaurants too 'cause I don't have to do dishes or anything and ...
L:  Yeah, 'cause I mean [MN] I like to have a good meal once in a while but like [LAUGH] financially ...  Coincidentally, like right now I -- I just fixed us some pasta and some steak and it's like real tired after making the food and all.  And, you know, I got all the dishes and everything's messy.  And then you got to eat it and then you're so -- I don't know.  You just want it [MN] right there.  Right in front of you, you know.  But, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  I find satisfaction making a meal sometimes.  
R:  Mm.
L:  A good meal, you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  Particularly like pasta or something like that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's --
L:  So -- so --
R:  -- your favorite meal then?
L:  Something with pasta.  
R:  Oh, just -- yeah, with pasta?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Uh, God it varies.  Sometimes I like Chinese food.
L:  Oh, yeah, Chinese is good.
R:  Yeah, I like stir fry and, um, I used to have a wok so I used to make my own, like, stir fry and egg rolls but now I guess I go to a restaurant.  And, um ...  But another thing I like and, I don't know, it's hard to find it but it's, like, I like rutabagas. 
L:  What are those?
R:  Uh, they're like this round vegetable kind of hard thing that you have to cut up.  You know.  And then -- then you cook 'em like mashed potatoes or something.  You know, with butter on 'em.  They're pretty good.  That or squash.  Oh, and they're orange, so ...
L:  Are you a vegetarian, by chance?  No?
R:  No.  I used to be.  Um, yeah, kind of.  [MN]  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  I -- I kind of am too, uh, with certain -- with certain meats, I [LAUGH] [MN].  I'm a -- I'm -- [several inaudible words] if I rather -- sometimes, it depends on the meat then I -- I just get repulsed by ...
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh, I don't know, s- -- you know.  [MN]  With some food.  I guess if -- if it's, you know, hidden well.  If it's prepared well, [LAUGH] you don't think about, you know, think about it that much.  And you just eat it, you don't really care.
R:  Oh.  Well --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- then sometimes I'm scared to eat at restaurants because you hear about, like, kids working and, you know, doing gross stuff to pizza.
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  You know, the fast food.
L:  The med- the media's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The media's kind a blown that out.  Those were like a few, like, dirty soups, you know, kitchens and all. But, uh, I don't know.  It depends what type of restaurant you go to.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, you know.  [MN]
R:  I love the Olive Garden.  
L:  Olive Garden's great.  Yes.  Yes.  [MN]  That's the number one Italian, you know, restaurant that's -- that's good, yeah.  I love it.  
R:  Yeah, their --
L:  I love the Olive --
R:  -- food I can eat but it fills you up right away.
L:  Yeah, pasta -- pasta can do that.  And then they have, uh, uh, neverending pasta bowl and all that, but you know you can't get past, like, the second one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Mm.  Yeah.  
L:  They fill you up on the bread sticks.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yep, I haven't tried their wines or anything but ...
L:  Neither have I but, uh, I don't know.  I can choose my own.  I -- I don't think they have a big selection.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I like their -- well, their linguine is good.  
L:  Ligu- linguine with clams.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  So, what part of the U.S. are you in?
R:  Um, Minnesota.
L:  Minnesota.  Okay.  Cool.  I talked to someone there yesterday from Minnesota as well.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  Oh.  Okay, what state are you in?
L:  I'm in Maryland.  
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I don't hear any difference but ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh --
R:  I don't know.  Kind of -- kind of a little bit.  [MN] 
L:  So you were saying, uh, you cook stir fry, like, I been -- I -- I gotta cookbook, I mean, like, if you -- if you cook stir, you know, if people cook, you know, stir fry that -- that's pretty good food.  I mean, compared to, like, pasta it's pretty easy and it tastes good but stir fry --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- there -- there's -- there's a real taste to it.  So, uh -- uh, why did you -- why did you start cooking?
R:  Oh, 'cause I just -- I love -- I don't know, I liked Asian food and it was good and I have diabetes so I can eat, like, stir fry --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and it doesn't make me sick or anything or it doesn't, you know.
L:  I see.
R:  [MN]  You know, I mean, it just agrees with me.  That and I kind of look -- I don't know I kind a learned how to cook from other people.  Like somebody taught me how to make, like, the stirred, um, fried rice and then I went to a cooking class to learn how to make the stir fry and stuff and, yeah.  And then the egg rolls I talked to somebody that was [inaudible].  And they told me how.  'Cause I wanted to get the spices just right.  And, um, they're not that hard to make but they're kind a tedious.  
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN]
L:  How -- how -- how long does a usual dish take?
R:  Uh, probably, oh, not that long.  Maybe about twenty to fifty minutes.
L:  [MN]  Man.  [LAUGH]  You know, eat it like in five minutes.  [LAUGH]  You know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Man, [MN] that -- that -- that -- that's what I hate about this cooking, you know.  I spend that -- that -- you know, that amount -- that amount of time on, you know, cook- cooking the meal and it's [LAUGH] gone [several inaudible words].  Uh, that's why -- that's why I guess I'll stick with restaurants.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But it's just the waiting around thing.  It's just like -- and then after a while I'm like, "Oh, why did I order this?"  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I ordered all this food.  And I'm like, "Maybe I'm not that hungry".  I don't know.  And then, you know, fifteen minutes later and you're like -- and you're all enthused.  You know, you [inaudible] in the restaurant.  You waiting, ten minutes go by.  The excitement's going down, you know, like, "Okay, where is the damn linguine and clams.  I'm [several inaudible words], you know, I'm starving".  
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know it's just ...  And then the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- food comes and then, hey.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, I think my favorite thing was, oh, I went to this restaurant called, I think it's the Spaghetti Factory.  They have this excellent ice cream pie.  
L:  Ice cream pies?
R:  Yeah.  That's what --
L:  [MN].
R:  -- I remembered about it.  Not like the pasta or anything.  The ice cream pie.  It was a little pricey but it was nice.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What type of ice cream?
R:  I think it was chocolate. 
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So it's just like -- so how -- how -- how was it different from regular ice cream?  Chocolate ice cream?
R:  I don't know.  Probably it had whipped cream on [LAUGH] it or something.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Or made with gram crackers or some weird thing.  I can't really remember it.  It's like "Oh, my God".  It's like a little slice of heaven or something.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  And that's what you have everyday.  
L:  And even like cheesecake.  [MN]  That's -- that's a little slice of heaven right there.  Cheesecake's --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- great.  
R:  Yeah.  I love -- yeah, I love cheesecake [inaudible].
L:  And I can just eat cheesecake, you know, and, I don't know ...  Well, I'm a pretty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- slim guy but, I mean, [LAUGH] I, uh, I love cheesecake.  And it's just ...  I don't know, I guess I'm getting away with all food but --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  Well, yeah, I'd rather eat cheesecake at a restaurant than make it.  I mean, I used to make it.  
L:  Oh, yeah, you can make it?
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can make it.  
R:  Yeah, well I'm --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- diabetic.  I'd probably want to eat the whole damn cake and I'd be sick for like a month or [LAUGH] something.
L:  [MN]  [inaudible] 
R:  But it's not too hard to make either.  Yeah, but you could make all kinds of flavors.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, if --if the [several inaudible words] but I -- I trust getting from, you know, like out of state, like New York has, like, the best cheesecakes.  'Cause like the cows there.  It's like all the ingredients that you have really matter to the taste of the cheesecake.  
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, like, f- from the milk to the -- to the cream, to everything.  And, you know, matters, you know, where -- where -- where you're getting your ingredients from.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [several inaudible words].  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I used to do a lot of baking before I had diabetes and it's like, "Oh, God".  I think I could bake better than anything, you know.  Yeah, the ingredients.  Yeah, definitely.  'Cause like some recipes you need like real butter, not margarine, or something else.  Makes a difference.  
L:  Oh, you -- you can't -- you can't use, uh, butter when you're cooking now- +nowadays?
R:  Well, no I've just -- well, I count my carbs and stuff so I can't, like --
L:  How do you do that?
R:  -- have all the goodies.  Um, well like a carb is like, oh, one is like a half a glass of milk.
L:  Huh.
R:  Or, like, maybe a pear or like a half a cup of cereal.  I mean, I don't know.  There's a way to count 'em and ...
L:  Mm.
R:  And, you know, the sugar, like maybe one -- I'll say one piece of cake is probably the equivalent to two.  Like double.
L:  [MN]  Two -- two carbohydrates?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  So there's a lot of milk in there.  Half a cup of milk.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  So then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I do this thing and then I have, like, twelve to thirteen a day.  Then there's free food like, you know, some fruits.  I mean, mostly vegetables.  Yeah.  [MN]  But ...
L:  [MN]
R:  So are -- are you vege- -- no you're not vegetarian or anything are you?
L:  I -- I -- I try to be but I try to stay away from some -- some meats, I guess.  Well --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- particularly pork.  I, you know, I choose not to eat.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Um ...
R:  Yeah, I used to be more into whole foods and, um, I still --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- kind a remember that, you know, and ... [LAUGH]  I was trying to lose weight and, um, I don't know.  It's like it probably had, like, there's probably a weight that's just right for me and, um, I did weigh a lot less but I -- I felt a lot better.  You know.  So ...
L:  I -- I -- I guess weight there's like [MN] a huge person doesn't really have a certain weight it's -- it's if they're actually healthy, you know what I'm saying?
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  [MN] I don't know there -- there -- there's too much -- too -- too much of a label like being put on it.  Like what is, you know, the certain weight, the perfect weight or whatever.  But --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  As long as a person can -- can actively go about things and, you know, just, [MN] you know, [MN] in -- in decent enough shapes and, uh, jog and stuff.  I mean, most people can just, yeah ...
R:  Uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So -- so wha-
