L:  Hello.  My name is Angela. [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  My name's Rebecca.
L:  [NOISE] How're you doing, Rebecca?
R:  Fine.
L:  Good. [NOISE] [SIGH] Um, let's see  what do I think is worse?  Wow.  I think their all pretty bad.  Um -- mm. [SIGH] Wow.
R:  I think -- I thi- -- I don't know.  I think, um --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  -- probably smoking's gotta be one of the problems.  I've -- gossiping is pretty bad too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I don't think most people realize how bad gossiping is until it comes back and hits them.
L:  Gossiping?  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Definitely.  It slams ya. [NOISE]
R:  And -- and one of my -- my -- one of my worst things about gossiping is Christian people who go around claiming to be Christian and -- 'cause I'm from the south so I have --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a l- -- I deal with a lot of really holy roller Christian people and then they turn around and, you know -- you know what I'm saying?  They turn around and start gossiping about somebody and it's, like, "You're not supposed to do that.  You're supposed to be a Christian". [LAUGH] But they don't realize.  I don't know.
L:  Right.  I understand.
R:  This is the first --
L:  Right.
R:  This is the first thing I've ever done so 
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  I --
L:  -- you know, that's true.  Christians are people though so everybody sins so that's the truth there then.  But I understand [NOISE] what you're saying though [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about, um -- about gossiping.  About that aspect.  It's true though, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Gossiping is pretty bad because you take things and twist it and then it gets back and it's just -- oh, wow.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Gossip about?  I don't -- yeah, that's pretty bad.  Health wise though, I think drinking and smoking is, like, bad.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's, like, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- top notch bad.  Gossiping is like --
R:  Ah, well, I think drinking can be -- it just depends on the person 'cause it can be done --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- in moderation and it's not bad.
L:  Right.
R:  So, [MN] you know, th- th- -- I don't think gossiping is ever good. [LAUGH] I don't think there's a situation where gossiping could be considered a good thing ever.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think drinking, you know, in moderation, you know, having two glasses of wine a week is not gonna kill you.  It might --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even make you healthier.  So, it -- it just depends on, you know, what -- who the person -- you know, if you're talking about an eighteen year old college kid who, you know, goes out and has forty beers every night, you know, that's different --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- than [LAUGH] -- than, you know, if you're -- you're a middle aged person just kinda having a couple of drinks, a couple of times a week.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Ah, that's true.  And plus I understand that gossipers, especially whenever they say they're so called your best friends, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you tell them things in private and then they go right behind your back and then they [NOISE] just sit there and they say things and real- -- yeah, break your trust and your -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all that.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I think -- and I think probably smoking could be -- you could make the argument that that's never good either.  So --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's just bad all the way around too.
R:  -- there's no situation where smoking is ever gonna be good.  Like --
L:  No.
R:  My grandfather died from cancer and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- my aunt had to have a double mastectomy and they were both heavy smokers.
L:  Really?
R:  And, ah -- 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  So, [LAUGH] I kind of, ah, learned early on what I didn't want to [LAUGH] do.
L:  Yeah.  My grandma's in the hospital right now.  She's with emphysema real bad and her lungs are hardening up real hard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she has gook and all that good stuff, so it's, like, yeah, I understand that one.
R:  Yeah.  Well, see, like, my mama's parents smoked and my daddy's parents didn't and my mom's parents died mid seventies.  And --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- my daddy's parents are, like, ninety right now.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So -- yeah -- so, it's -- I mean, not -- it's not always like that 'cause you have the situation like George Burns who drank, you know, and smoked his entire life.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you don't know, you know --
L:  Who is blessed. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you're not gonna [MN] -- the probability of being able to be like that is really low so --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- I'd rather have statistics on my side than have [LAUGH] -- you know.
L:  Right.  
R:  Than -- 
L:  You're right.
R:  -- than take -- take a chance or whatever.
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  Um 
L:  -- yeah, smoking's real bad.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not healthy in any way.  Yuck.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I smoked --
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  -- and I quit. 
R:  I -- I smoked for a little while --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it's o- -- it's kinda odd because [MN] I mean, I was really young.  I've never inhaled. [LAUGH] I know that sounds clicheish now --
L:  No, no, no.
R:  -- but [LAUGH] I never really inhaled --
L:  I didn't inhale for, like, two years so I understand.
R:  Well, I only did it for a couple of months and this is going to sound really funny, but the whole reason started was so that when I smoked marijuana that it wouldn't be so bad.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I didn't even smoke weed that much.  I only smoked, like, maybe five times when I was in high school.  But I wanted to, like, not look like a complete retard when I did.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah, I understand that.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, sometimes -- sometimes I think I'm a little, like -- [MN] early back then, I was a little too smart for my own good because I was prepared for stuff like that. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I understand.
R:  So  but 
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's cool --
R:  I don't know --
L:  -- I mean.
R:  Well, what are the other options?
L:  Oh, well --
R:  Like there was smoking and drinking, gossiping --
L:  Exercise.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Was one.  Yeah.
R:  Over eating.  Overeating's pretty bad but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's all relative.  It depends on how, like -- it goes back to, like, the drinking and -- well, mainly the drinking thing, like, how much are you over eating?  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, are you, like, bed ridden [LAUGH] or are we just talking about somebody who's, like, you know, a size eighteen?  You know, that's different than like, you know -- no bod- -- not everybody has to be a size six.
L:  No.  That's true, but still.  I'm overweight and it's, like -- it's, like, yuck.
R:  Yeah.  I -- well, you see, I'm trying to lose --
L:  I mean, are you don't have to --
R:  -- weight right now.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, you don't have to gorge yourself, but, ugh.
R:  Ye- yeah.
L:  Over eating is bad, bad, bad.
R:  [LAUGH] It is.  It is.  And it makes you -- I don't think -- well, I guess drinking does to you, I don't drink enough to really think about that, but, like, when I eat too much I, like, feel, like -- I criticize myself.  I'm, like, "Why did you do that?" like, "Why ".  It -- it makes you feel bad about yourself.  It's not just, like, you know, you know you shouldn't have eaten that, but yet you do it anyway.  It's, like --
L:  Right.
R:  It's a -- it's a -- I mean, it's -- I'm not -- I hate to put -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things in, like, categories and stuff and say, you know, "I'm addicted to food" because I don't wanna use that as, like, a scapegoat.  
L:  Right.
R:  I don't want to use that as a, you know, an e- -- an excuse --
L:  A crutch or something.
R:  -- 'cause it's not --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  It's not but it kinda is --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- kinda like an addiction.  Because, like, I've been trying -- like, I've been really good for a couple of months, like, I lost a lot of w- -- like, I lost, like, fifteen pounds --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I -- I, you know, was exercising, like, three times a week and I was eating a lot of vegetables and no, like --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- carbohydrates.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And then I just stopped. [LAUGH] Like, finals came --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and I just -- I can't get back on my schedule again and it was, like -- you know, I feel really bad but I don't know, a- a- -- eventually I'm gonna start doing it again, you know but, you know, we -- like, the A.C. went out so I wasn't about to exercise in an apartment that's ninety two degrees and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, just things happen and you just, like -- I don't know, you lose the moderation and I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know why.  I don't know, like, why it is that I -- I could -- was able to keep up that pace for like two months --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and then I just --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- stopped.  It was, like --
L:  Yeah.  I hear you 'cause I lost fifty pounds and then it's, like -- I don't know.  Once I stopped it's, like, now I want to lose more weight and it's, like -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now, it's like, I ca- -- I -- I really want to do it again and now it's, like -- I'm just, like, "Ugh.  I can't get back in it".
R:  Yeah.  Well, see --
L:  And I know it's unhealthy to be like this.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I was up till, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think my height -- I mean, my top was, like, two thirty five and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm, like, five seven --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
R:  And -- yeah.  I'm not very tall and so -- I mean, I'm down to two twentyish and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, I mean it's a start but it's just, like, I wanna get down to like I was in high school --
L:  [MN]
R:  I was [MN] probably average wou- -- for me would be, like, one seventy.  And I'd be happy.  You know.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't really have a lot of weight to lose it's just a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- matter of getting the, like, moderation to exercise and stuff.  It's just really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hard for me and I -- I don't wanna change my eating pattern.  I would j- -- rather just exercise but you kinda have too.
L:  Right.  You do.
R:  [NOISE] To -- but see, and another thing I was afraid of -- I didn't want to lose the weight too fast.
L:  Right.  Oh, yeah.
R:  Because, um -- because I lost the weight -- I mean, I gained the weight slow so I didn't wanna have -- you know, where you see those girls that are on TV who, like, have to have surgery 'cause they lost too much weight too fast, and their skin wasn't able ?  I don't wanna be like that because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I can't afford to have surgery or whatever.
L:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, I'm -- I'm trying to do it slow.  I don't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- want it to be drastic.
L:  That's right.
R:  So 
L:  And that's what I did but still I was, like, [inaudible] overweight real bad and my stomach kind of, like, went flop. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's like yucky --
R:  Well, it's getting there.
L:  Yeah.  Yucky.
R:  It's getting there.  I mean only twenty three so I haven't had, you know -- I've only been gaining weight for probably about three or four years.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So it hasn't built up that much yet.  And -- and see my aunt -- my mom's always been -- I'd don't want to say she's always been skinny but she's never been overweight.  I've never --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have looked at my mom and thought she was overweight.
L:  Right.
R:  But my aunt has been -- I s- -- I've seen her problems that she's had to go through and, like, she's the one that had the double mastectomy, she, um, has always had really bad knees and just recently she had to have -- go in surgery and have, like, both of her knees redone.  And --
L:  Yeah.  Oh, wow.
R:  -- you know, I don't wanna say it's all because of the smoking but the mix between the smoking and her being overweight -- so, y- you know, it's -- you -- you see those people in your life and you're like, I don't wanna be that.  And, like, recently my knee started giving me problems and I'm, like, I don't wanna be that in twenty years.  I don't want to be that in thirty years or whatever.  And it's just --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  I guess for me probably the worse thing is being overweight --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think.  Ah, 'cause I don't really gossip or anything.
