R:  Hi, I'm Tim.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, hi.  I'm Sharon from Massachusetts.
R:  Hi.  I live in Washington D.C.
L:  Oh, hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, would you like to go first?
R:  So, which I think is worst, smoking, drinking alcohol, coffee, or gossiping?
L:  Gossiping or eating and not exercising is that what it was?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, um, let's see.  I would definitely have to say smoking out of all of those --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, for many reasons, um, smoking cigarettes first of all it's very bad for you, um, you know, lungs and all --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, not to mention -- I guess it falls in with drinking.  But, um, the corporations I would go along with, uh -- with, uh, big tobacco and who would be, uh, profiting off of -- off of your -- your addiction and not being able to get over that addiction --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, because of all the -- the crap that they put in there.
L:  Mm.
R:  Any extra nicotine, um, and on top of that who -- who would be, uh -- who they give money to like the -- the Ku Klux Klan and, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, racist groups like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the, uh, testing of animals, um, on top of that.
L:  Argh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I have to agree with you of all of those personal habits.  My brother smokes and he has tried so many times to quit the poor guy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and it's -- the addiction is just tremendous --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and where it's so insidious.  It's not like a heroin addiction where people scorn you.
R:  Right.
L:  It's so soc- -- always had been so socially acceptable for so long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that people just fell into it and -- and now, my goodness, you try to get out -- like you said, they put so many additives in it to increase the addiction factor --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that good luck getting out from under it and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- no matter what he's done he still goes back to it.  It's just such a ph- -- it's not only physical and chemical, it's just become such a big part of your daily life.
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Your -- your life is definitely changed when you try to stop.  And it's interesting because like -- like the Cool brand cigarettes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're, um -- they're logo with the double L. -- I mean the double O. --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is actually when they're -- they're linked together and that's an old hobo sign for, uh, don't give up --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- or never give up --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- which is kind of a weird thing that they're telling you, like, you know -- like you're not gonna be able to give this up [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, you're not gonna be able to break it.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's just a very interesting thing.
L:  That is.  That's -- that's terrifying.  Did you ever smoke?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, uh -- yeah, I mean every now and then I still want one but, you know ...
L:  Oh, my goodness, imagine that.  How long has it been?
R:  Um, it's been a couple of years.
L:  Well, good for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hang in there.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  But, I mean, I live with people --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that are smoking, uh, they're having lots of trouble.  But, I mean, then again like alcohol is definitely a, you know, problem.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yep.  But, I mean, alcohol leads to smoking and to [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's it.  You're in a bar or something and ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Oh, I ...
R:  And that reminds everybody of, uh -- of smoking anyway is when they drink --
L:  Oh, sure, yeah.
R:  -- 'cause that's usually what they're doing, you know, like it just goes hand in hand with each other.
L:  That's it.  You have two hands.  So, they both must be occupied.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, that is something though, isn't it?  It's -- like they put in -- they said something about caffeine too and I -- I drink a lot of coffee --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I've noticed when I was pregnant, for instance, I gave it up totally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it was hard.  I --
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  -- I was completely, um -- I don't know -- I was a junkie sort of, you know, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's a mild addiction, but you really get wrapped around it and that's -- that's another one of those, um, habits that's linked to ...
R:  You get so used to it.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sit down.  It's like oh, it's coffee time.  Everything goes with coffee.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Mm, gee.
R:  Yeah.  But even gossiping is pretty bad too, it kind of -- it, uh -- I'm not really sure which one's worse.  They're -- they're -- they're just as bad, on the equal -- on different levels I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause like gossiping, I mean, it totally ruins communities and ruins, uh -- it ruins a lot of friendships and things like that.
L:  Oh, does it ever.
R:  So -- so I don't know.
L:  That's true.  That's a -- that's a habit that tends to do more harm to others than to yourself.
R:  Right.
L:  I noticed -- I -- I worked at a couple of different places and, um, my last job was at Monsanto --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I can honestly say that in the entire time I was there, there was never any gossiping.  If somebody left the room nothing was said about that person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's so rare because in all the other jobs I worked at if -- if somebody left the room it would be immediately, "Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about that person and I hated it because you know darn well when you leave the room they're talking about you.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, it's -- it's quite an environment when there's no gossip in the workplace I think, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's a lucky place to be.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  Yeah.
L:  And I try not to participate in it, but [MN], I don't know, it's just such human nature, you know?
R:  Yeah, it is.  It's very hard.  It's very hard not to ...
L:  "Did you hear about so and so?"
R:  I guess it's hard not to do all of them, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to be honest with you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's hard not to drink.  It's hard not to smoke cigarettes.  But then again that's easy if you're not addicted to it.
L:  Well, if -- I guess if you don't start --
R:  Doing it.
L:  -- at all --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- um, with the cigarettes especially.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I suppose with the drinking too.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Some -- I think that tends to be more of a, um [LIPSMACK] -- some people are perfectly capable of just drinking a little bit and go on for the rest of their lives just drinking in moderation --
R:  Right.
L:  -- while other people, you know, they can't.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  The eating and, uh [LAUGH] -- the eating and not exercising --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't -- I don't know.  Some people's metabolism is a little bit faster than others.  So, I don't really find that as a -- a big problem.  I guess that would be more a personal issue --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with, uh -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't -- I don't think that that is definitely up on my list.
L:  Mm.  I agree.  It's, uh, getting more, uh, press lately though because some people want to, uh -- I don't know where it was, but somebody was suggesting that, um, ice cream be taxed, fast food restaurants pay a -- like a fat tax.
R:  Wow!
L:  Isn't it weird?
R:  I haven't heard that at all.
L:  I don't know.  My husband was clicking around -- and I don't know if it was on C.N.N. -- and there was some sort of debate as to whether or not --
R:  Very interesting.
L:  -- you know, it should even be taken seriously.
R:  Very interesting.  Huh?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  Should -- should the places that, um, sell these types of foods pay a higher --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- either tax or -- or insurance premium because of the rampant obesity in this country?
R:  Wow!  Well, the problem is -- is -- I mean, if you look at it like there's places -- a lotta people in, you know, the United States are poor and, uh, you know, going to McDonalds is a lot easier than going to the grocery store.  I mean, when you can get a thirty nine cent hamburger, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, instead of buying, you know, fresh organic vegetables then, uh, you're kind of, uh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's -- you know, obviously something's gonna happen there.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I wonder.  It's true.  We've created our own, uh, culture for that sort of thing.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  Everything is go, go, go.
R:  Yep.
L:  And get it -- get it quick like you said.
R:  Yeah.  Everything's gotta be done fast.  But definitely cigarette smoking for me is probably one of the top problems.  I guess -- well, I mean -- I don't know -- alcohol is -- you know, a large percent of alcohol is probably worse --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, 'cause of what it does to the communities and, um, you know, families and friends and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and who profits off of that is big alcohol corporations and, you know?
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  And, I mean, they get the same money, the same people, they give it to the Clan to -- you know, to all the like racist groups and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I don't know.  So, there's a lotta --
L:  That's horrible.
R:  -- there's a lot of, uh -- like I was saying.  I mean, if you -- if you look at -- like I live in a city.  So, if you look at a liquor store and, uh, there's one on every corner, um, usually in the poor neighborhoods, like every, uh -- every, uh, corner store will probably sell beer usually.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But if you look in, uh -- and so you're -- you're talking at least two per -- you know, almost a block, so -- or three blocks and then you, uh -- you look in the richer neighborhoods and there are definitely, uh, not liquor stores [LAUGH], um, they're -- they're -- they're call markets more or less and -- rather than saying like beer and wine on them --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, uh, then you go into liquor stores and you see who's in there and it's usually people that probably can't pay their rent --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, um -- or don't have houses.  So, maybe, yeah, alcohol is probably definitely -- definitely better, um, but I guess that's by a [inaudible].  So, I don't want to go with all that other crap that goes along with it.
L:  It's true.  They -- you hear sometimes of -- like of certain companies will market -- like the malt -- the malt liquor beverages in the large cans --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to poor black neighborhoods --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where you go -- you go into a black neighborhood and they're all -- all the billboards --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's deplorable.
R:  Yeah.  It's really -- it's really sad.  Not to mention like malt liquor has the car- -- really bad like carcinogens in it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and so like -- I mean, it's --
