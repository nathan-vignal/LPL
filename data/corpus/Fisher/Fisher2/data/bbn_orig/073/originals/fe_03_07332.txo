L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Kelly, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?  My name's Debbie.
L:  Hi Debbie.
R:  Hi.
L:  Did you get the last sentence that they said?
R:  It's something about -- I did, and I missed what it was -- it was something about going to a doctor --
L:  [LAUGH] I wasn't quite sure.  Well they say how do you keep yourself well?
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  How do you keep yourself well?
R:  Um, the only thing I was going to say that I do is once a year -- and I've been doing it for a number of years -- is, I get a flu shot.
L:  Oh really?
R:  And I -- I'm going to say, I guess I've just been very lucky in the past number of years that I really -- if I get a cold once a year, that's about my extent.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I don't know if it's having to do with getting the flu shots, if that's helped, or I've just been very lucky.
L:  Right.  I've never had a flu shot before --
R:  Oh no?
L:  -- and I -- and ah, this past year I did get the flu, which was just an awful thing --
R:  Yes.
L: -- I was sick for like three days straight, couldn't get out of bed, and ah, maybe [LAUGH] -- 'cause -- I should consider getting it.
R:  I've had different friends of mine -- we go back and forth with this, 'cause I -- it's something -- my parents go every year and I just -- I don't know, I started for a number of years, I just -- just one of the things I just go when they go and I guess I really just don't even think about it, it's like okay, but I don't know if that's what's been good for me 'cause I'll have different friends of mine and they'll say well, they get colds and they get this, and this and it's like would you get flu shots?  And no, and so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know if it does or not, but I thought, "Well I'm going to stick with it, if it keeps working for me, I'll keep working -- getting the flu shots every year".
L:  Do you take vitamins or anything like that?
R:  And I do take vitamins, yes.
L:  I do too.
R:  I take like a multi and then I do like a um -- I don't know som- -- there is -- they -- you hear different things that you should have this and this -- and I do like a B -- I do do a C --
L:  Uh-huh, me too.
R:  -- I figure well, Cs is good too for colds, so yeah I do do that.
L:  I'm still taking my prenatal vitamins [LAUGH] -- I have extra ones of those.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but yeah, I'll probably end up getting more multi vitamins after they're gone.
R:  Yeah, there was -- I worked with a lady [MN] for a while that -- and she was real big with vitamins -- like -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "Well you need that ..." -- and I said -- and I did find out that I was taking -- a number of years ago -- some with iron, and I think then I got too much in me.
L:  I see.  Do you normally go to, like a, a regular doctor once a year, or ...?
R:  Now, that I don't unless there is something wrong.  
L:  [MN] But ...
R:  I mean, I go to like, you know, your OB --
L:  Right.
R:   -- the gyna-, or the gynecologist.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I do that once a year for my check -- you know, the yearly things you gotta do.
L:  Right.
R:  I [inaudible] the regular doctor unless something's wrong -- no, I don't.  Not just for like a check up or ...
L:  Mm.
R:  I guess I'm pretty fortunate with that -- how about you?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I'm -- I don't go to the doctor, except for the OB as well, ah, once a year, um, but I'm -- keep taking my kids to the doctor, so [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's a big thing -- I d- don't have the kids, but I've got a friend of mine and she is non stop at a doctors with, with the kids.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, she's there quite often.
L:  So, what else do they want to know, do you think? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know -- do they just keep going back and forwards about that, 'cause I had a topic -- I ended up trying this last night and it was actually about, um, eating in or out of restaurants.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That's just amazing -- I guess you can go back and forth a little more than what you think.
L:  Hm, let's see.
R:  With the pros and cons.
L:  Let's see -- what else do we do to keep -- keep ourselves healthy.  Well --
R:  Like I said, I don't know if it's the vitamins or like I said -- and I do have like I said, the friend of mine that's -- that's talked about the vitamins [COUGH], you know, she'll -- I'll hear her say that like if you think you're going to catch a cold or coming down with a little bit, I've heard her say that she would double up on her vitamin C.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I don't know if that does make a difference.
L:  It possibly could, I know it doesn't hurt you because it's just --
R:  I was just going to say -- I -- yeah, it probably doesn't hurt.
L:  It -- it comes right out of your system what you don't use, so --
R:  Yeah, there are -- now there are some vitamins that don't.
L:  Right.
R:  But I do believe the ones I've been taking, like the Bs -- I think there is like a B complex, and I think it's like a B six and a C --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I did have, um, the doctor 'cause I went for something and she had said -- mentioned to me about taking E, so I do do that.
L:  Oh I see, ah -- do you know anyone that is very ill, or has any problems that they have to do -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- go to the doctor [inaudible] a lot, or ...?
R:  Not out here, no.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's good.
R:  But you -- I know there are a lot -- there is a number of vitamins that you can take that your body will just -- the excess will just come back out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There are some that doesn't do that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I do believe the ones all I'm taking, that the body will eliminate what it doesn't need, so -- which I guess is good, that way you can't get too much.
L:  Right, I guess while they're -- [NOISE] if they're water soluble. 
R:  Yes.
L:  And then the body just d- -- ah, excretes them.  Yeah, hm --
R:  But that's interesting 'cause it, it is a big thing you know -- the back and forth -- does, does the flu shot really help, or doesn't it?  You know -- 
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- it does make me wonder.
L:  I don't know, I, I guess I haven't gotten the flu shot because I'm not too fond of needles [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah, I do hear some people say that they've had the flu shot and they get sick even if they take -- that they will still get it anyway.
L:  Really?  Well, see this is the first time that I've ever had the flu in like, I mean since probably I was a child or something, so I thought, "Well, I've never had it before, I'm not going to get sick", you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, but it just hit me like a ton of bricks, I tell ya -- nobody else got it, but me [LAUGH].
R:  Now I -- it's been -- it has been a number of years since I've had it, since I've really had like a flu -- it's been a few years.
L:  Mhm.
R: But yeah, when it -- when you do get it, it, it's bad and it's miserable.
L:  It is.  I -- I couldn't believe the -- the array of symptoms that you go from --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- from like chills, that's what I first came down with -- chills, and I thought, "Gosh, is it -- I'm just cold", you know it -- and then, that went and then I got, um, a fever --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and cramping in my stomach, and then, then I was throwing up in the middle of the night, and then the next day I just -- I could not get up, I was so tired.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And um, I was just, "This is ridiculous, this has got to be the flu ..." 
R:  Yeah.
L:   And luckily it happened on a weekend, where my husband was home, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I could just stay in bed.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I don't know what I would have done -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he would have had to stay home.
R:  'Cause it -- it's miserable -- like I said, it's been a number of years that I've had it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it, it was miserable --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I, when I have had it.
L:  But ah -- the, the symptoms -- I mean it was weird 'cause like one thing would come and then the next thing would -- it -- then it would go away and something else would come, and it --
R:  Oh my goodness, that -- yeah.
L:  -- it was just weird -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- so and luckily the throwing up didn't -- you know, that was just maybe five times and then that, that was over --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then the next day it was just -- more, just really, really tired, and fever and that kind of stuff, but -- I'm glad I haven't been that sick either, um, it was weird -- one weird thing was when my mom was down here after I had my baby --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, she started developing jaundice and we didn't realise it, 'cause we were like -- we saw each other every day and when she got home to her husband after four weeks, she looked in the -- you know, he looked at her and said, "What is wrong with you?", you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  And her, her eyes had turned yellow and she had developed, um, it's called autoimmune hepatitis, and it's just this weird hepatitis thing that your auto -- that your immune system, um, shuts down basically --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she had to get all these steroids and different things and we just didn't know what was going to happen, but luckily she's fine now, but it's weird how some things can develop and you not even see it, you know what I mean?
R:  Not realise it, yeah, that's ...
L:  It was strange, and I -- it was like the day before she left my husband was like going, "She looks kind of tanned", [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, but we weren't out in the sun or anything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know, and it was, it was January here in Atlanta, but it was nice, so it was -- it, but it was weird, it was just, oh my god ...
R:  Yeah, that, that's really something to get that, 'cause I think I've only heard people mainly getting it what, like um, kids in like the hospital or something.
L:  Mhm, no it wasn't -- nothing that she got from anybody, it was just her own immune system --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- rejecting her, ah, I guess the -- everything in her system for her, from her liver, and it wasn't processing everything, and it was just really -- it's str- -- I mean, I'd never heard of such a thing.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that is something.
L:  So, ah, luckily it was treatable and -- and she's fine now.
R:  Yeah, to get over it and ah ...
L:  But she has to continue with medication and -- and stuff like that and [SIGH] -- you know, that's just something she'll have to do for the rest of her life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But she is alive [LAUGH].
R:  Another big thing I know you hear a lot of people who -- they get -- it's like the asthma.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  The asthma, and then a lot of peoples allergic to a lot of things, now that's something I've been very fortunate.
L:  There's a lot of people that -- here in Georgia, have allergies.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  A lot of people do -- I've never had allergies, ah --
R:  No, not had anything with that -- no, nothing with asthma, nothing with allergies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but that's -- that's big for a lot of people.
L:  Very big.  I know my friend's daughter has it and she's just turned three and, you know, she's -- took her Florida and it got a lot worse --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and brought her back up here and it actually got a little bit better --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, I don't know if that has to do with the weather or not, or the humidity or -- who knows what's in the air, you know, but um, she's gotta be on medication as well, and I'm just thankful my children don't have anything like that either --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and that I don't either.
R:  Yeah, 'cause that, that's a lot -- if, if you have d- -- if you're allergic to things, or have the asthma, that's -- it's tough to be around or to, you know ...
