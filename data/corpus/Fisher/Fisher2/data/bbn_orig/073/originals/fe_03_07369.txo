L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Roger.
R:  Hi, Roger.  I'm Alice [LAUGH].  This feels --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- really weird [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, this is kind of odd.
R:  Have you done it -- done this before or is it your first call?
L:  Uh, I did it a while ago but this is -- this -- I haven't done it in a while so --
R:  Oh, okay, uh, yeah, this is fir- -- I mean, I -- I had one phone call already but this is the first time I've ever heard of this programme this -- this week [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so, the getting ill thing?  I think it's just that people are outside more now in the summer and --
R:  Yeah, maybe so.  It's right.  I was -- I thought it was funny, that topic because I actually got a cold last week and I thought how weird [LAUGH] --
L:  'Cause yet --
R:  'Cause I don't seem to get them and I -- I get it in the beginning of summer [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I've been -- I've been trying to get over one for the last couple of weeks so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Gone through a couple of boxes of tissues a day [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I keep coughing so, oh, well, it'll get better but [LAUGH] -- so do they really last the week like they said or --
L:  Um, I -- I think they last longer than a week.  Uh, they usually do for me.
R:  Yeah, I think, I mean, I -- maybe just the [MN] -- toughest part of it is about a week but there's oth- -- other symptoms I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  Is that, like, I --
R:  But --
L:  -- think after a week you start to feel better but it's not completely over.
R:  Right, yeah, yeah, true, true [MN].
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  I don't know how --
L:  -- did --
R:  -- how could I be in sick for ten minutes [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I can't because I don't know what to say.
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  Um, to -- to get over it I guess I just, like, try to ride it out.  I don't like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, like, I'll take nicro to go to sleep maybe sometimes the worst nights --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but otherwise it's just, like, not much you can do about it.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't do much either.  I'm not into taking a lo- -- I mean, I'll drink orange juice or the fluids or whatever some, you know, sounds soothing but I don't take a lot of stuff.  Never have and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my kids never did either, so [LAUGH], I mean, I never had my kids do that and --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- w- -- i- -- it's probably better because you're not, like, pumping them full of some stuff that they're probably not going to need.
R:  Right.  I know it's funny and then some people [MN] just spend tons of money on stuff and they say it still ends up lasting up the same amount of time [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, so [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, like, I work at a grocery store and that's -- and, like, people just buy all this stuff and I'm, like, "What do you need all this stuff for?"
R:  [LAUGH] I know that.  I mean, I think I have aspirin in my house or maybe time alone, that's got [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I just [MN] -- and -- and we've actually had to throw those out because they've expired [LAUGH] because we just don't tend to use them [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, we're the -- we have the same problem.
R:  Hear, hear [LAUGH].  Mm, mm.
L:  I mean, it -- it's like people, like, they -- they -- they don't want to feel any kind of pain apparently.
R:  I guess, that's right, but, I mean, it doesn't make it go.  I don't think taking all that stuff makes it go away.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  To me it doesn't anyway I think.
L:  No.  I -- I
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I think the only thing that you can possibly do is just ride it out and let your body, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fight it off.
R:  Right.  I still think that's the best thing.  I -- I -- I w- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Everyone's going to fight it.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'll give in and maybe take something just to help me sleep, you know.
L:  Yeah, especially --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if there's something big the next day.
R:  Yeah, and it's like you have to get some rest, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true [LAUGH].
L:  I've -- I've had those nights where you just can't get to sleep and it -- because you're, like, up sneezing, like, all night.
R:  Uh-huh, and just so miserable.  Yeah, that's -- that's how I was up four or five nights ago.  It's, like, oh, yuck [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Keeping everybody awake just with my moaning and groaning [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] -- [MN]
L:  Yeah, I had that as soon as I got home.  It was just -- I couldn't get to sleep so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- took some [inaudible] -- knocked out [MN].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Mm.  Okay, well, now we're --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, god.  Ye- -- yeah, when I first signed up for this thing I thought it was supposed to be, like, a group of people talking, like --
L:  No.
R:  -- um, when they said conference call I assumed that meant four or five people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't know that it was going to be one.  It was, like, okay [LAUGH].
L:  It -- it'd be -- it'd be a lot easier to talk t- -- ten minutes [MN] four or five.
R:  I think so [LAUGH], more -- more input at some time.  It's, like, okay, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [MN] Yeah, the first -- the first one I did was about, like, terrorism at the airport or something and I'm, like, "I don't know what to talk about" [MN].
R:  Oh, wow, yeah, like --
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, mine was about computers in schools, like, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Seems -- seems -- seems like there's more there.  It seems like there's more to it than this being sick thing.
R:  Yeah, I know.  It's like [LAUGH] how much can you talk about being sick [LAUGH].
L:  It's, like, I don't like it.
R:  You know what?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's nothing [LAUGH].  You don't want to be around people [LAUGH].  Uh, yeah, uh, that's how I finished up at my work.  People come in that are sick and then everybody feels like they're exposing them but they don't want to miss --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- work so they come in [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, it's kind of a vicious circle for us [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Get everybody else sick.  We have the -- a lot of customers come in.  They're buying stuff to help them get better but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- then they're, like --
R:  Coughing and sneezing all over us [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah, and then -- then -- then it gets disgusting.  I mean [MN] --
R:  I'll wear that [LAUGH].  Uh, wh- -- what grocery store do you work in?
L:  Oh, I work in a -- a regional grocery store --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- from -- I -- I'm from the Philadelphia area, so --
R:  Oh, okay, so, probably different stores there.  I'm in Oregon and we probably have --
L:  Yeah, you [LAUGH] --
R:  -- totally different stores.
L:  Yeah, you probably -- you probably wouldn't have heard of this one [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, we -- we only have twenty so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Very small.
R:  Uh, I see, yeah.  Oh, I guess.  Yeah, I, um, I do some secret shopping besides doing this type of stuff and I secret shop grocery stores a lot [LAUGH] [MN].
L:  [NOISE] Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  It's, like, I'm in grocery stores a lot [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, we -- we have the -- we have those people come in and tell us usually that we're doing a good job so --
R:  Yeah, yeah, I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- most people do.  I w- -- never -- I've never had a really bad one.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  You know, they're not always perfect but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, yeah, can't always expect perfection anyway, so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and, I mean, I should have.  Managers do but [LAUGH] but, uh --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- or --
L:  Some of our customers do all say the same.
R:  Oh, I doubt, yeah, yeah, that's true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [LAUGH], yeah, I'm trying -- the first -- the first call of this I did and the one I had the other day I was in the middle of doing a grocery shop when my cellphone rang [LAUGH] --
L:  Did you?
R:  -- and I ended up talking to somebody in the middle of the grocery store [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  That -- that had to be interesting [MN].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  God, why didn't I just hang up and call back but I wasn't quite sure how it would work and I was afraid if I disconnect, uh, and I knew, uh, that I didn't have to do it so I don't know what I was thinking.  I just thought, "Oh, I'd better do it" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, they -- they can call me while I'm at work and it's -- and I -- I have my phone off so that they, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- leave a message so I just call back and, like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- after I've finally figured out who it was.
R:  Yeah.  I had one the other night.  It was, like, eleven thirty at night and I thought it was supposed to stop, like, at eleven.
L:  Um, I -- well, I think it all depends on when you put that -- your availability in.
R:  Well, I thought the last time on availability was eleven but, um, maybe it was later --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but [LAUGH] mm, but, uh, um, sounds like some easy money.  I don't know.  Uh, have you -- do you know anybody that's actually been paid from it [MN]?
L:  Uh, well, actually, from my first call it was paid already.
R:  Okay, and it was the same company?
L:  Uh, yeah.  It's -- it's the University.  It comes on University --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, cheque, so --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  That's the University, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I mean, I've chatted with people on line that said they've gotten paid but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I thought, "Oh, well, even if --"
L:  Makes it a lot more --
R:  Even if it is -- does end up a scam at least you haven't put any money out.  You've just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- spend ten minutes [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Ten minutes talking to somebody you don't know.  It's like --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're all different.  It's not [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- about being sick.  It's like [LAUGH] see [LAUGH] that is a funny topic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, what else can we say about being sick?  Um --
L:  [LAUGH] But when you chat on line you don't have to worry about being sick.
R:  That's true, that's true [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause that's happen to -- happens to be what I'm doing right now, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, that was how I found out about this actually.  It was on a -- on a forum for secret shoppers and that was listed.  Actually, they were debating it because some people felt it was a, um, [SIGH] a thing that was about, I don't know, sometimes they thought the whole thing tied into ra- -- racism and stuff about different races, so, I don't know.
L:  Oh.  I have -- I'm not exactly sure what they're trying to do.
R:  I don't know either.  Somebody said that they had -- that it was all funded by United States government and if you followed the links, uh, I don't know.  People were just getting weird with it.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I don't really care [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, m- [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, you can't get too much information over talking about being sick [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Not -- not too much from me from being sick but --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess depending on the topics I guess they could get some good info- -- and they record the whole thing, right?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then you can leave a -- you leave thing -- uh, comments at the end.
R:  Uh-huh, so --
L:  That's if they're trying to stay on topic 'cause it's really hard [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  It's like I'm going okay.  I -- I want to do what they say but I don't know what else to say about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Heck, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sheesh.
L:  Well, when -- well, since I see -- uh, apple sauce can -- when -- when you're sick do you, like, find certain foods that make you feel better?
R:  Um, well, I guess, probably every -- have some comfort foods that they like.  I kind of for some reason like ice cream [LAUGH] when I'm sick [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh, like -- like in the form of a -- a shake.  That seems soothing to me so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like all I want, a real nice --
L:  Yeah, I'm --
R:  -- shake [LAUGH].
L:  I'm al- -- I go for, like, the, uh, like, when I'm really sick I go for just apple juice.  It's --
R:  Oh, yeah, if you're really sick I'm -- to me ju- -- yeah, juice something with a bit of -- see, I guess it depends on what type of sick [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, a cold it's just whatever, whatever I'm in the mood for [LAUGH].
R:  Right, yeah, yeah, but, you know, you get really sick you just don't want anything, I guess, you know, just liquids then.  Um, yeah, my -- my husband, yeah, I've got him trained now.  He just knows.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Got get me a bur- -- a burger filled chocolate shake [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I'm miserable [LAUGH] or something [LAUGH].
L:  Least -- least you c- --
R:  But I guess there's also the old sh- --
L:  -- at least he's got it down now.
R:  Pardon?
L:  I'm sorry.  At least he's got it down now.
R:  Yeah, yeah, he's already got that down and there's the old chicken soup thing.  I guess that's supposed to work for a cold [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause I -- 'cause when I usually have a cold then I don't want anything to eat [LAUGH].
R:  I know, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I guess, probably the chicken soup thing was probably just really the broth is all that I want to eat that was ever good for you really just as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the liquid and the steam of it or something.  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it might be all...
