R:  [NOISE] Hi.  My name is Loren and I'm from Wisconsin.
L:  My name is Sherry and I'm from North Carolina.
R:  Oh, boy, there was a list of [LAUGH] -- of -- about per- about personal bad habits that a person has, ah [SIGH] -- [MN] I -- I was almost flabbergasted because I -- it to me it's a -- gee, it's almost each and every one is actually a -- a horrible --
L:  Bad, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, bad habit.  I have gone, ah, personally, through two of them.  My husband was an extremely, extremely heavy smoker.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah -- a [LAUGH] --
L:  How interesting because I was gonna say that was the worst one of all because my husband is a heavy smoker and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I'm trying to get him to quit. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Has he quit yet?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well, mine went cold turkey two --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- years ago.  Ah -- I had -- ah, from the time my children were in grade school -- I have two adult married children now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, but they had -- the schools they had started pushing it and, ah, he just, like, he absolutely would not listen if I asked him to quit smoking.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, then the kids, ah, due to problems -- not problems, but due to them talking about it at school he did, ah, stop smoking in our house and, um, it was -- he'd smoke outside.  Well, then we kept on pushing, pushing and it was just -- and he did try and I think that is a very hard habit to break.  
L:  Yeah.  It is.  
R:  It --
L:  I've quitted smoking.  It's not impossible but -- yeah, it's, um --
R:  [MN] Y- y- yes.  But it is difficult --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and, ah -- so he had just smoked outside.  Well, after our oldest daughter got married, um, and it did take a long time, because, ah, they were married seven years and they finally gave us a grandchild.  And this granddaughter was two years old and we were going on a trip, and we were going with them, and our daughter came right out and told her father, she says, "As much as I love you Dad", she says, "You cannot go in the car and smoke or have smoke smell on you".  And I think it was just like, somebody poured, you know, wat- -- cold water on his face or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because he'd just -- and he made up his mind and that was it.  We were gone for a week and a half and, I mean, I thought it was gonna be living hell with him.  [LAUGH] And -- no, I mean, it was just him wanting to have his granddaughter with him and he gave it up.  And I should knock on wood because it's been two years, ah, this month that he has quit smoking and I -- I mean, for a while he would get that, ah, urge to wanna do it again, [SIGH] but, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hasn't, you know.  And, like I say, I thank God every day, I says, [LAUGH] that he hasn't done it.  And he feels better since he has.  So 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you feel better.
R:  Yes. [SIGH]
L:  I know I feel a hundred percent better.  I know my husband would if he'd just get it through his thick skull. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But it is -- you know, I [inaudible] it -- we all ha- -- I -- I used to have a very bad habit of unfortunately biting my nails and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- same thing.  You know, I mean, you work at it -- you work at it and it just is so hard to try and give something like that up.  Has your husband tried too?
L:  Oh.  Several years ago when my eldest son was born who'll be seven next month.  He, um -- he thought that the greatest reason in the world to quit but --
R:  A- yeah, oh.
L:  -- then hasn't -- has not done so, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm still working on him.  My dad, um, passed away last month actually and he was a smoker, and I don't know that had -- that had to do -- had much -- I -- I'm sure it had something to do with it.  He had a massive heart attack but --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and I keep saying, you know, you need to do this for your children.  My dad was only fifty nine.
R:  Oh. [SIGH]
L:  I don't wanna have my kids go through this, you know.  So --
R:  Oh, no.  That's very, very young.
L:  -- it's a horrible, horrible habit.  Yeah.  It is very young.  I've since meet lots of people who've lost their parents even younger than that, which is [SIGH] awful but [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.  An- and it's no matter what age I was very blessed to have my parents, um -- my mother d- -- um, my father died first but my father lived to be eighty two.  Ah, my mother died four years ago of -- unfortunately, she had -- did have cancer and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it had -- she was in remission and it came back and, ah -- it took her.  But I thin- -- and my dad was also a very, very heavy smoker.  [SIGH] Ah, he did give up the smoking and basically he did -- he had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my father just died of old age but, ah, it did cause him to get a very mild case of emphysema due to the --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- smoking. 
L:  Right.
R:  So there are a lot of bad -- th- -- you know, ah, repercussions from smoking.  But again, I says I -- I don't fault anybody because I says I -- I've got probably m- more faults than other -- you know, th- the general public.  But I says it's -- not matter what it is, whether it's the liquor or, um, somebody us- using drugs or whatever it amounts too.  They are not easy habits to break.
L:  Sure.  Sure.
R:  So I says, it -- it kinda goes through you and I says -- and we did go -- not my immediate family but, ah, like, kinda shirt tail relatives that was involved in the drinking and it affected him, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just horribly, you know.  I mean he was, ah -- he had an extremely good executive type job, and basically he got to a point where he was taking coffee and, I mean, telling people he had coffee in there and it was coffee mixed with, ah, booze.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, he lost his job and -- and really lost his family, lost everything.  So I says, it's -- it's hard -- and I mean he woke up to the fact now but it's -- unfortunately it's a little too late.  You know, I says, when you lose, ah, everything I says then that's -- it's bad.  
L:  Right.
R:  It really is bad.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's a physical addiction.  Just like drugs and [SIGH] what not so -- I would guess --
R:  Ye- --
L:  -- nicotine's a drug, so it's just -- it's -- it's a hard habit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to break.  It's not impossible though.  I did it so --
R:  That -- how long ago did --
L:  I think cold turkey's the way you have to do it.  About ten years ago.
R:  That's right.  Ah, pardon me?
L:  About ten years.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you've been off then for quite a while.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Almost ten years I guess.
R:  Good.  But I bet it does feel better.  I -- I sometimes wonder if that would have had now -- ah, and I mean you do hear that it -- it does have an affect on [MN] -- you know, you sound like you probably are a quite a bit younger but I mean, on a pregnancy or something I would -- just wonder how much that could affect --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, someone that does smoke --
L:  I guess it depends on how much you smoke.  My mom, um, [LIPSMACK] used to -- wh- -- she was a smoker back -- I'm thirty eight so she had me in, ah, I guess, sixty four and I'm the oldest.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So she -- and she smoked and, [SIGH] you know, who knows what damage it caused.
R:  [SIGH] [MN] It -- that's --
L:  Really.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  You know.  Nothing obvious but whose to say that, you know --
R:  Ye- and -- if -- and maybe you were one of the fortunate ones, ah -- and I'm not say- -- you know, I mean, but, ah, [MN] there are some, I'm sure, that it can affect, maybe I -- I have always heard that it could affect the weight of a baby.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But again I don't know -- I'd -- that was one habit I probably never did pick up was, ah, smoking.  But, ah, like I say, I've got enough [LAUGH] -- you know, I mean, other habits, like I said, ah, it just -- it -- I -- I -- I would never fault, like I say, anybody, you know.  I mean, because there's always -- it's a -- it's -- you look at your own, you know.  I mean, even from, ah -- I -- I don't like -- another thing that bothers me a lot is, ah, gossiping.  I ha- -- I don't mind talking with people and I do do a tremendous amount of jabbering.  I've very --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- very fortunate.  My husband has an extremely good job where it leaves me the option of not having to work. 
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, ah, so I -- I find myself -- I do a tremendous amount -- of -- of -- amount of volunteering but again, like I say, I do a jab- -- a lot jabbering.  But I don't like people that just will have a tendency to gossip.
L:  Right.
R:  And, 'cause that -- that can be so hurtful and hurting other people I -- it -- it bothers me a lot.  I don't like to, ah -- I mean, we all get I'm sure somebody that can kind of slap you almost in the face, you know, by saying something -- but I -- I'm not the type of person that wants to go back and retaliate or -- or go and say things, you know, about other people.  I says, it -- I'm sure I have done it, you know, I mean but it's never been intentional, like, I says, where I would want to out of my way to hurt someone too.  So, I -- but --
L:  Right.  I live in a fairly small town in North Carolina too and I've heard other people talking about, you know, somebody might talk to me about somebody else who just happens --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- to be a really good friend of mine, so --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you never know who knows who --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when you're in -- in a small town and you're out to dinner or what have you.  [COUGH] So 
R:  That's true.  I -- I've got, ah, a niece that lives out in, ah, ah, is it  wait is it, South Carolina or North Carolina?
L:  North Carolina.
R:  -- in Charlotte.
L:  Yeah.  I'm about two hours from Charlotte.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's where --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she's living and it -- we do to -- I -- I was born and raised in a large city in, um, -- [MN] as a matter of fact I was born and raised in Milwaukee which is the biggest city in Wisconsin.  But, ah, my husband moved me quite a bit farther north [LAUGH] and now we live -- when I first moved out here I almost had heart failure and, I mean, because it -- there was no houses, no nothing.  We were just out in the boon docks.  And I had a very hard [LAUGH] time adjusting but -- I -- it's like anything else, you know, over the years, you know, I says you learn to adjust to it and it amazes me I says how much the area has built up.  I says, I -- where I used to live in open fields and saw cows walking around me, I says, now we have the, ah, subdivision.  And -- wh -- and we're very fortunate because the subdivision has to have at least five acres of land so it's not like house on house.  But I says, it's still a very, very small community.  Um, and it basically at the -- the closest town that I live is the college town here in Wisconsin.  So, I says, you -- you see a lot of the young ones where it's the drinking and it's -- [MN] that kind of bothers me but I says, yeah, you know, you take it the way it comes.  I says there isn't much you can do I says sometimes in a situation [NOISE].  Ah, do you have more children th- than just besides your son.
L:  Ah, two boys.  Two boys.
R:  Oh.  How wonderful.
L:  Yeah.  They're four and six.
R:  Oh.
L:  Soon to be seven, so -- two little guys.
R:  That's -- and I had them -- I had, like I say, one of my two girls and I says both of them are -- [SIGH] and neither one of my -- I'm blessed with the two son in laws that we have because neither one of them, ah, have ever smoked and, ah, they're what you -- a social drinker is I guess what you --
L:  Right.
