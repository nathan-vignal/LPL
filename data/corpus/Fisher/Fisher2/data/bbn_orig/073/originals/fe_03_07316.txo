L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Sharon.
L:  I'm Roseanne.
R:  Sorry?
L:  I'm Roseanne.
R:  Roseanne, whereabouts are you from?
L:  I'm in North Carolina.
R:  North Carolina, oh, I'm up in British Columbia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so, have you done one of these calls before?
L:  Yes, this is my second one.
R:  Oh, my third.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, so, what do you like to do?  Restaurants or at home?
L:  Ah, well, I'm not such a great cook, so I would say restaurants.
R:  Restaurants, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you like to go for?
L:  Oh lord, everything, I love --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You're my kind of girl [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I love Mexican, I love Italian, I love Indian food, I love Ethiopian, um --
R:  Eth- oh.
L:  Um, I love, I guess -- ah, I don't know what standard American is, I don't know exactly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, what that would be um -- I like regional cooking --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- um ... and I guess -- what [several inaudible words] -- I guess because I'm in the south, I like certain southern type foods.  I love seafood.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  I love traditional seafood, non Calabash and then I like Calabash --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, or, I love Thai food, Chinese food -- it's just -- so much -- I think because --
R:  [LAUGH] So, somebody invites you out to a restaurant, you're there, right?
L:  [LAUGH] No, it's just -- I like different varieties -- I mean I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's 'cause I eat out a lot I -- I can't eat at the same place all the time and then, um, there's always new restaurants opening up, so I like the --
R:  Yeah, that's true, there is a pretty good turnover of restaurants.
L:  Yeah, so I like to check it out and -- and see.
R:  Yeah, ah, I think my -- probably my favorite would have to be seafood.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A nice ah -- like a dungeon[?] of crab --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- cooked up real nice with ah, just a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I'm a happy camper.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that -- I think that's my favorite thing to do -- that and then just anything done on barbecue.
L:  Yeah, barbecue's good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's really good.
R:  Yeah, let's see what -- well, I kind of do like cooking at home though, the thing I like about it is you can make really elaborate meals without the really elaborate price tag [LAUGH] --
L:  That's true, that's true --
R:  -- you know, so --
L:  -- it's cheaper to, to cook and eat at home.
R:  Yeah, yeah it definitely is and you know, if you've got the right recipes and follow along, it's -- it's not exactly rocket science --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- it's pretty easy to do.
L:  That's true.  I'm a baker -- I -- I like to cook sweets --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that's not necessarily a good thing --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- cookies, brownies, cakes, um --
R:  Now, you see, now I don't do that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] a pie or two, I'm not a pie person --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I'm good at that, I've done that ever since I was a little girl, I mean, um, my mother wouldn't go and run out and get sweets for me, so -- you learn how to make them at home.
R:  Yeah, you want them you gotta bake them yourself.
L:  Yeah, and I like doing that for friends, that's better than going out.  Even though we have a lot of dessert bars around here [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  That's kind of a nice idea though, make a -- a nice dessert for people to come over and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and share it that way.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I've cooked -- I haven't cooked too many really, like I would like to -- I mean other than, you know, maybe some, um -- what have I cooked?  I've cooked a turkey before --
R:  Ooh.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm surprised that came out okay --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- um, ah, casseroles are easy for me, they're pretty easy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- any type of um, veggie casseroles are um, simple to do.  I'm good with the microwave.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can make some tasty things out that microwave --
R:  Really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just use mine just for basic reheating, I think --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  That's about all.
L:  I've made a chocolate pound cake out the microwave --
R:  Oh, you're kidding.
L:  Mhm -- taste bet- --
R:  I've never even tried to do something like that.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah, I -- I -- I like that microwave thing --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's quick.
R:  Yeah, well I guess it would be.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um I had recently bought an um -- some people call them fly daddi-, fry daddies[?], but um, a deep fryer, doo hickey --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And um, the only thing that I've cooked so far is fish, and that turned out pretty good, but I want to learn how to do like donuts.
R:  That would be fun.
L:  You know, and then I saw this thing, ah egg rolls, like you know, like prepackaged kinda --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And like frying those and see how -- how that turns out.
R:  Hey, you could have a lot of fun with that -- trying different things.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I -- I -- I was thinking about getting a fondue pot -- a friend of mine had a party where um, you know, we um, chopped up the vegetables and you know the guests helped put it together and everything and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- had um, one fondue pot like with um, melted like cheese --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know for the vegetables and meats and then had, um, um, like a -- a dessert type cream cheese for -- and chocolate and that was kinda a nice um get together.
R:  Yeah, it does sound nice.  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  We had a fondue pot when I got married, but [LIPSMACK] I don't even know where it is anymore, it's probably buried at the back of one of the cupboards.  I think we used it a couple of time, but ah, I always thought it was just a little bit too fussy, you know -- it is nice, when you have people over it's you know, I guess it is kind of a neat idea --
L:  Did you say it's too salty?
R:  Mm?
L:  Did you say too salty?
R:  I'm sorry I can't hear you.
L:  Did you say too salty -- you thought it was too what?
R:  No, too fussy.
L:  Oh, too fussy, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's -- when you're trying to you know, you've got to cube everything up and get it all out there, but I guess with any type of cooking you've got to do all that preparation anyway --
L:   Yeah, 'cause I was thinking about a wok [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Which is the same thing.
R:  Yeah, yeah, ah well, it's fun.
L:  [LAUGH] So, and -- and I guess for me somet- -- I don't know it's probably better to eat out, but then I'd have all those -- I have -- have gotten all those discount, um, food warehouse things like Costco[?] and BJ's[?] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I, um -- it's -- it's definitely cheaper [LAUGH].
R:  It is, but then again, you know, it's nice going out to restaurants every now and then esp -- you know, like on special occasions and -- sometimes just because you don't feel like cooking --
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  -- and that does happen [LAUGH].
L:  That's true.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And sometimes for me depending on -- sometimes it's slightly cheaper because, um, some places are like um, like a -- a -- um, like to me like there's a place called Biscuitville[?] and around here -- like they're only breakfast foods and you get a -- a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit, a juice and a sandwich roll and I know their prices went up, but you know, like you know, three dollars --
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  You know, or some places, little places like maybe Fresh where they um, chicken salad, um, or something like that -- two dollars and something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, in the end it depends -- it could be cheaper going out, for me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, or you can find healthy foods as well --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- because we have a lot of farmer things on the side and you can pick up fresh vegetables or sometimes now they're um, making um, like little dishes or whatever, you know I guess they're selling right along with the vegetables that are really healthy too -- inexpensive --
R:  Yeah, so if you had to choose a place to out for dinner, like, tomorrow -- what would you pick?  
L:  The Outback, because I've never been.
R:  The Outb-, that's a steakhouse right?
L:  Um, yeah, I guess so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's um, I hope it's not a total steakhouse, um --
R:  We were just down in, um, Puerto Vallarta in -- well, last -- in December --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they opened an Outback down there and I thought, "Ooh, we should go try it", but we neve, never got to it, we were too busy eating all the Mexican food.
L:  Oh, I hope it's not all steak 'cause I'm not a steak person.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] -- they probably have chicken and everything else.
L:  I always hear about the blooming onions.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, I mean -- that's what I'm thinking about, more than anything -- those booming onions.
R:  [LAUGH] Sounds good!
L:  [LAUGH] Because there's a place -- I don't know if they have one out there -- Bahama Breeze?
R:  No.
L:  Um, they have these onion rings and they're made -- they have coconut -- they're -- like the batter has coconut in it --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and um, they have a sauce -- a fruit sauce -- one is sweet and one is sour -- it's like fresh fruit grinded up with something else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and of course I love the sweet but it's um -- it's really good, the coconut and everything -- I w- -- I wouldn't a thought I would a liked that but they're fabulous.
R:  Yeah, it'd kind of add a different flavor to it --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  The sauce and everything -- but um, I'm addicted to that place, I go there often.
R:  Yeah, what's it called again?
L:  It's called Bahama Breeze -- it's like Caribbean t- -- I guess, I call it, not real Caribbean food, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- modern type --
R:  Americanized [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I kinda m- -- yeah, it kinda reminds me of um, what's another Amer- -- it's not very Mexican, it's -- I call it um, Tex Mex or south western --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um -- On The Border -- something, it's, it's a chain --
R:  Yeah, there's a lot of them out there.
L:  Yeah, and they're like -- it's not real Mexican food, it's like, an interpretation, like -- but, um, I don't know -- I can't -- I can't -- think of anything else other than -- I think every State should have buffets but I've come to realise from friends and um from relatives that that's only typical in the south.
R:  Really?
L:  I -- I mean -- I h- -- like I have a friend in Wisconsin and um, um, he -- he said they don't have buffets up there.
R:  Oh, they do all over the west coast, I know that.
L:  So, maybe that's just a -- like a, um, I don't know a northern um, well I know, oh, I guess in New England because one of my friends is from New England, so, maybe, that spot in the -- what, the mid west --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe they don't have ...
