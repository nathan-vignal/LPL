L:  My name is Michael.
R:  Hi, my name is Debbie.
L:  Oh, hi, Debbie.  Hey, um --
R:  How are you?
L:  -- this thing actually works.  Oh, pretty good.  Pretty good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just got -- got home from my job as a telemarketer.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Well --
R:  Now --
L:  -- actually telephone fundraising.  So --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a little different.
R:  Now it actually took a few minutes.  I've been waiting about, a little over fifteen minutes for it --it to go through because I thought, "I wonder how long you can actually sit here and wait?"
L:  Yeah.  I did too.  Last -- last night the person hung up on me as soon as I said hi, so ....
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And, um, maybe I still have the telephone -- telemarketing sort of voice in my --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] in my voice or something like that.  
R:  Yes.
L:  But, um, yeah, yeah.  Let's see they said talk about food.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, the subject tonight was pretty interesting so I thought, "Oh, I'd give this --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- this one a shot".  
L:  Okay.  Well, wha- what kinds of foods do you like?  Do you like seafood, uh, [inaudible] steak --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- things like that?
R:  No seafood.  Um --
L:  No seafood.
R:  Steaks, pasta.
L:  Okay.  
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Excellent.  Oh, um, [LAUGH] that definitely [inaudible] like lobster and crab and things like that, so ...  [MN] I was actually quite disappointed because, um, gosh, um, I once, um, thought I was being so romantic my senior year of college.  Took my, uh, girlfriend out to this nice seafood place and everything like that.  It turns out a two pound lobster wasn't her idea of, like, you know, a delicacy.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm like, oh.  Lobster and steak, you know.  What could be more romantic than that?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, well, if you don't like lobster, I guess not.  But ...
R:  That's true.  [LAUGH]  I mean, I do -- I'm --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- not real big on eating it, you know, but if I'm out I'll take a few bites of it, but it wouldn't be something I would order out.  
L:  Right.  Right. 
R:  But I would --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  I would try it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have tried it.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's interesting to talk about, like, eating out, like, at the restaurant and stuff.  I'm -- I'm always grabbing takeouts since I'm always on the go it seems.  And ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know.  I guess, uh, the bachelor's life, or whatever.  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some -- you don't have anything in your fridge except stuff that has, you know, become a science experiment or something like that after a while.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yes.  So it's very easy to go out with those kinds.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But not having the larder, just doing it [MN] by yourself.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've -- I've gotten to the point where it's almost more functional than anything else, you know.  It's like, okay, well I need to eat so I'll just grab whatever I can get.
R:  Now that's --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- one thing I didn't think -- I thought it would be kind of hard to ever get tired of restaurant eating out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I had worked out of state, [MN] I don't know, for about six months.
L:  Okay.
R:  And my work had put me up in a hotel and so ninety percent of my eating was eating out.
L:  Uh.
R:  And it's like [MN] I guess maybe you can get tired of it.  I didn't rea- --
L:  I think so.
R:  I didn't realise but I guess knowing that -- it was almost easier to eat out and there was like other people of us.  There was a few others of us, you know, travelling and doing this type of a job.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even though the place they had put us up in was like a long term, uh, it was called like the extended stay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Since you had a little kitchenette that you could eat in, but it's like, you know just for one and, you know, each one of us, everybody was kind of by themselves.  Everybody was out there single.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  It was like I guess it is easier.  And in the beginning it was, like, fun.  Oh, eat out, you know.  Let's try this restaurant.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Let's try this restaurant.  Let's try this.  And after a while then every other weekend they would fly me home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was like I'd come home and, you know, get together with friends or something or family and it's, like, let's go out to eat.  It's like, I don't want to eat out. I want a home --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- cooked meal.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, for, like, twelve days you eat out and it's like, okay, I want a home cooked meal now.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean it's got its, yeah, it's got its good and its bad, I'm sure.  
L:  Yeah, I -- I --I think the last home cooked meal I had, um, actually I briefly dated a woman who was like seventeen years older and everything like that.  And, uh, she cooked for me.  That was kind of nice.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like, "Wow, you're young enough to be my son" and I -- my counter was, uh, well, you know, um, well, let's see.  You know.  Uh, you maybe a little bit older but, uh, you're independently wealthy and everything like that.  Why can't women have mid life crisis just like men do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, like, true.  So she cooked for me.  So I thought that was pretty cool.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But I think that's the last time I actually had a home cooked meal, you know.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I was dating her briefly.  Um, well, actually, no.  I -- I take that back.  I cook stuff but I'll then, you know -- one thing I've, uh, learned to do is, um, cook like pork chops or beef or something like that, um, all at once.  Like on a Sunday night.
R:  Yes.
L:  Put 'em all in Gladware containers and then I'll just heat one up in the microwave, like one day each, um, each day of the week or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's one thing I've done as well.  So that way I can at least have something home cooked.  Um, although it's probably still pretty -- pretty processed, you know.  Like processed noodles and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Frozen[?] chicken and stuff.  But, uh, that -- that -- that's one way I counteracted that.  You know, just more from an economic perspective.  Because if I went to like- -- um, if I went out to a sit down restaurant every night I'd be broke by now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  Yeah, it can --
L:  I'm just out of college.  [MN]
R:  It can get expensive.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Yes, it can --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- be for that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess that sometimes you do get tired, I mean, after you do it a while.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It can be, like, okay, it's -- it's time for home cooked meals or just a change a pace.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, did -- did you do like, um, what, like, consulting or something like that?  Um, I'm trying to think of, like, types of jobs where people spend, uh, you know, stay on assignment for a while.  Was it like, you know, um, corporate consulting or something like that?
R:  No, what it was is I had worked for department stores and we had opened some up in another state.  And they --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- just kind of needed help.  
L:  I see.  
R:  So it was kind of interesting.  But like I said it was just a thing.  Every night it's like, okay, let's try this restaurant.  Let's go to this restaurant.  It was like it, you know, [MN] and our meals were all paid for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause we got, like, an expense, um, voucher -- you know, got expense money each week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like, okay, we'll do this restaurant and, of course, you know, you're gonna eat, kind of -- after a while you get tired of, you know -- then you want, okay, let's just go fast food or, you know, you do the main restaurants in the beginning 'cause its new.  Like okay --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I'm not just -- not paying for this.  I'm given this money so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do this and this and this and this.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, do -- do -- do you like, um, uh, what I- Italian food I guess?
R:  Yes.
L:  You know you mentioned, like --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- uh, uh, pasta and stuff.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I love that.  Have -- have you ever been to a place called Marjiana's[?] before?
R:  Never heard of that.  Now where are you from?
L:  Oh, I'm on the east coast.  I'm in, uh, Washington D.C.  [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Okay.  
L:  And --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh -- yeah, I know they have locations, um, they have some in Washington and some in Philadelphia.  A friend of mine works in, uh, Marjiana's up there.  
R:  I've never heard of that.  
L:  Okay.  It's kind of one of those, um, I wouldn't say quite -- well, a family style Italian, I guess, is how you describe it.
R:  Okay.
L:  Like sort of upscale.  But, uh, yeah, that -- that place is good.  They have these huge dishes and you just pass 'em around and share with everyone and, mm.  It's really good.
R:  Okay.  I think I've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- heard of something like that but it would be a different name.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can't even think what it is.  But I think I've heard of something like that that you -- they order big quantities and, yes.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I just love, uh, fettuccine carbonara.  That's one of my favorite ones.
R:  Pardon?
L:  Oh, uh, fettuccine carbonara.  
R:  Okay --
L:  [several inaudible words]. 
R:  -- not heard of that.
L:  Oh, okay.  It's got, like, um, uh, you know, like angel, um, [MN] well, actually noodles and things like that.  Like you have like a little bacon in there and some tomato.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And like fr- fresh sliced tomatoes and, uh, fettuccine, uh, uh -- gosh, I'm trying to think what kind of cheese you put in there.  Well, actually you just have like an Alfredo sauce.  Alfredo sauce and egg and bacon and stuff.  
R:  Yeah, that -- yeah, that's --
L:  And really good.
R:  I like that, yeah.  The fettuccine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the Alfredo sauce.  That -- yeah, that I like.  
L:  Nice and salty.  So ...  Yeah, I can definitely go for that every now and then [inaudible].
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, cooking for myself.  Yeah, [MN] I -- I --I did my thing once again this week of cooking like chicken and Rama[?] noodles and packaging it up so I can [LAUGH] heat that up when I go to work and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because, um, uh, throughout the day I don't really have that much time in -- in the middle of the day.  I run two -- two separate, uh, four hour shifts.  Like forty five minutes in between, uh, for dinnertime.  Since I work afternoons and evenings.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, so it's really easy.  'Cause I just pop it in the +microwave.  Pull it back out and presto.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, so that would be easy.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So it would be just as easy as if you go out --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and then you can be in, and if you've got other stuff to do it's just as ea- -- it's not [MN] -- it's kind of a thing with the topic.  It's like, okay, it's got its pros and its cons.  For a while you're okay eating out and then after a while it's, like, nah. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And you. Like, eat in sometimes.  So it's [MN] -- probably goes back and forth.
L:  Yeah, I've-- I've -- I've noticed that.  Like, um, for example I -- I guess some people would just act, um, I don't know, [MN] like, um, maybe wealthy business executives or lawyer lobbyists which we have, you know, right down in D.C. where I live.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, certainly if they wanted to they could go, you know, easily spend, uh, one, two hundred dollars, um, every single meal if they really wanted to.  Uh, that wealthy.  But [several inaudible words] you know, bring a little bag of lunch, sit down in the park everyday.  You know, an apple, ham sandwich, or something like that.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Preparing their own stuff.  So, yeah, I guess definitely, uh, you can get old, uh, after a while, you know.  Uh, steaks and manhattans and, uh, whatever else you want to have.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it can get expensive too.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like you said, when I was out, you know, working in another state it was like -- plus it was okay because it was somebody else's money.  
L:  Right.
R:  So it's like, okay, we -- you know, go here and you can go here and go here because you were given so much money per day to eat.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  For just food.  So it's nice but then when it's your own after a while it's like, [MN] [several inaudible words] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like I'm -- I'd, um, the first year in college I had a girlfriend that always wanted to go out to eat.  Um, her father was an investment banker in New York and she had, I guess, his credit card and, I don't know, parents like me so they're like, "Yeah, you know, take Michael out to eat" you know and everything like that, you know.  Let him live it up and everything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I was living on a more modest budget.  My parents are like, "Well, you know, even if we have lots of money, you know, you -- you're in college and everything like that and, you know, you'll live, uh, within reasonable means".  You know, which I accepted.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was fine.  But she was always like, "Let's stop to eat" and I'm like, you know "Oh, I don't have any money".  And she's +like, "Oh, you know, I'll cover it and everything".  So then I was like, okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Go out to eat all the time then, uh ...  Specially like right after swim practice, you know.  It was either you reheated leftovers from the fraternity house or you go out to eat.  Um, it wasn't much of a contest when I wasn't paying.  So, those were definitely the days.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I [inaudible] like, um, an ad somewhere in the papers, you know, looking for woman to take me out to eat, you know.  Once or --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- twice, uh, a month or something like that.  
R:  [MN]
L:  You know.  [LAUGH]  Make good conversation and everything.  Trained as a professional.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, profess- -- [MN] but not conversational[?] necessarily.  But, uh, yeah.  Yeah, that'd definitely be good. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  Okay.  All right.  Well, let's see, I'm trying to think.  That's, uh, pretty much covered it in some respects.  I mean, I guess today you could sum it up saying that, you know, restauranting's fun for a while but it gets old after a while.
R:  Yeah, it would get old and then it's time, okay, then
