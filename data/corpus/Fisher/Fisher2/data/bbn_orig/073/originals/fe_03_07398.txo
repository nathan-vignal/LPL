R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Len.  I'm in, uh, Oregon.
R:  Oh, okay.  This is Natesha in Pennsylvania.
L:  Natesha?
R:  Yes.
L:  In Pennsylvania.  Where?
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  That's where I'm from.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow!
L:  But I've lived out here for a long time.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I lived in California for twenty years.
R:  Oh.
L:  Are you, um -- how did you find out about this?
R:  Uh, in the paper.
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  So, which do you think is worst?  Or shall I go first?
L:  Well, uh, go ahead 'cause, uh, I forget all the things that they said.
R:  Okay.  I think some, uh -- there was gossiping, overeating, not exercising, smoking, drinking and some other stuff.  But I definitely think gossiping is much worse because if you overeat or you smoke or you drink or you don't exercise then you're only affecting yourself, but gossiping can -- it can affect other people in a really negative way.  So, that's definitely the worst in my opinion.
L:  Okay.  Was it over- -- was it over talking?  Was it, uh, talking too much?
R:  Oh, yeah, talking excessively.  Right.
L:  Talking excessively.  Well, um, I don't like that one too much.  Depending, uh, on how busy I am.  I think there's a lotta people that aren't sensitive to, um, who they're talking to and they talk too much.  Um, when people are busy I think you should have a sense of, um, how busy -- how much, uh, somebody else wants to hear and also what the other person is interested in.  There's people that will start talking because they find something interesting, but they don't check to see if the other person's interested at all and I find that kind of offensive.
R:  Mhm. That is pretty rude.  [COUGH]  But I think that if you're talking about something and someone doesn't find it interesting then they should say something to let you know that -- that they don't find it all that interesting.  I mean, why sit there and let them talk and talk and talk and go on and you're not interested and you're not paying attention and ...?
L:  Well, how do you say that in a way that isn't rude?  That's -- that's, um, my problem with that.
R:  Oh, I see.  Well, if someone was talking -- well, people have done it.  They'll talk and talk.  For instance, like, uh, at work if I answer the phone someone will talk and talk and talk and they don't realize that other calls are coming through and there are other people I have to call and I'm too busy.  So, I just give this really kind of uninterested bland response [LAUGH] and I guess it's rude on my part but, like you said, I can't come out and say, "You're talking too much and I'm not interested".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I say, "Really?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Well, listen" and then I go on to another subject and usually -- I'd say nine times outta ten they get the point.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But if you kind of indulge, like, "Really?  I don't believe.  Did that really happen?" then they just -- it just fuels the fire.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, let's see.  On -- you -- you thought, uh, gossiping was the worst of those?
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Because smoking, drinking --
L:  Right.
R:  -- eating too much, not exercising, they're all personal choices.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- and, I mean, there's just -- there's a reality there.  Even if -- I -- I guess unless you're in deep denial you know what you're doing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know of any person who smokes that doesn't know that it's truly bad for them, or who drinks and they don't know that drinking in excess is bad for them and -- but gossiping, I mean, just -- let's just say there are two people, there's A. and a B. and they're gossiping about C. and some of the facts are misconstrued or whatever, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it could affect -- it could affect the way that other people view C. and it can be totally untrue.
L:  Right.  Well, I would, uh, tend -- I would tend to agree with you and, um -- but I think, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the, uh, one I mentioned would be the -- what I would place second 'cause, uh -- the second most annoying thing.
R:  Mhm.  Was it the most annoying thing or the most -- was that the words they used?  Because if it's annoying I --
L:  Or the worst, the worst.  I don't remember.  But I would -- I would put, uh, excessive talking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then, uh, 'cause I -- I know people they wanna talk, they feel like talking, but I'm busy --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I need to work and then, uh, uh, I look like the bad guy when I say, "I've gotta work".  But actually, um, that usually works if I -- like you said, if you tell them, uh, "I don't have a lot of -- of time to -- you know, I've gotta get back to work, you know?  So, you'll have to excuse me".
R:  Right.  [COUGH]  I think -- excuse me -- I think if I had to choose the most annoying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- see for me someone talking to me excessively isn't that annoying just because I think I've mastered the art of tuning people out --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and someone will talk and I'll tune in just enough to catch key phrases so that maybe they'll think I'm listening, but really I'm not.  But I think the -- the other most, uh -- the worst thing would have to be -- let's see -- smoking.
L:  Uh-huh.  Smoking.
R:  Only because sometimes people don't wanna smell smoke.  Like if somebody's drinking alcohol and you don't drink I mean by them drinking alcohol you're not really experiencing any discomfort.  You know what I mean?  But when someone's smoking and you don't want them to smoke or you don't wanna smell smoke around you then I think that's an invasion of -- hm, I don't wanna say privacy -- it's an invasion of per- -- their personal space.
L:  Mhm.  But of course if somebody's drinking, um, especially if they're -- they drink excessively then they get drunk and then they can, um, be obnoxious.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, then -- that's true.
L:  And they can become a problem.
R:  That's true.
L:  But, uh ...
R:  So, you're saying that like as opposed to smoking, like maybe drinking could be more annoying --
L:  Mm, it could be --
R:  -- than smoking?
L:  -- or it could be close to, uh, as bad as smoking.
R:  Right.
L:  Depending.
R:  Hm.  I don't think the other two -- I think it was eating too much or not exercising --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or taking care of yourself I don't ...
L:  Well, here's -- here's one.  How, uh -- I don't think they mentioned.  What about body odors?
R:  Oh, did they say that?
L:  No.  I don't think they mentioned that one --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- as an example, but that -- that is, uh -- that could be a very big problem for the -- the people that, uh, smell bad.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And how do you deal with that?  Have you ever come across that?
R:  Yeah.  And it's really -- it's a really sensitive situation.
L:  It's sensitive but, um, do you ignore it or do you, uh, tell them about it?
R:  You know what?  It would depend on how much I was around them.
L:  Mm.
R:  Like, uh, let's say for instance it was somebody I lived with, like it was a roommate or something, I would definitely talk to them one on one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But if it was somebody I saw once a week or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- five minutes a day or something like that I'd just try to avoid them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I wouldn't feel close enough to them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to -- I mean, because I'm sure they'd be pretty embarrassed to have you come to them and say, "Hey, you stink".
L:  Well, they would be, but the -- the fact -- the fact of the matter is you'd be helping them.  Those people that have that problem, uh, everybody avoids the confrontation about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, one of the biggest favors you could do for them is to, um, bring it up and deal with it, and it's a painful subject, but I've had that situation, uh, with one person, uh, who I've known for about three years and I noticed that almost immediately -- and everybody else who dealt with her noticed it too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I had the courage to, uh, deal with it and I had to deal with it more than once also.
R:  Wow!
L:  And, uh, she was -- she's a -- she's a very, um -- she's got some very good qualities.  She -- she doesn't gossip about other people at all, which, uh, is kind of unusual I think.  I think, uh, people tend to fall into that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I admired her for that.  But she also had, um, probably the worst odor problem I've ever come across.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, I was able to tell her that and, um, she took it well and she said, uh, that she wasn't really aware of how she smelled.
R:  I think that's the case a lotta the time that -- that some people are so used to themselves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that ...  And I was just thinking that you could almost compare the same thing to -- to, uh, smoking.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because like for a lot of people it's the smell of the smoke that really bothers them unless say, for instance, you're talking about body odor it's the same thing.  But then -- then the issue is that smoking is scientifically proven to be really bad for people who inhale the smoke, who aren't smoking at all.  But body odor it's -- it's more of an inconvenience.  It's not like ...
L:  A major inconvenience.
R:  Right.  It's not like something that's really life threatening or serious or may cause ya harm or something like that.  I mean, you just -- you know.
L:  Actually ...
R:  It's kinda gross, but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  It's, uh -- I wanted to mention that those scientific studies that that is based on are actually bogus.
R:  The second hand smoke?
L:  Yes.  That is, uh --
