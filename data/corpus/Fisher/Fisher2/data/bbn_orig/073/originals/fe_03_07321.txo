R:  Hi, I'm Roxy.
L:  Hi, Roxy, I'm Barbara.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing fine.  Where are you from?
R:  Texas.  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, from, well from New Mexico, but living in Utah.
R:  Oh, how's the weather?  I bet it's beautiful there.
L:  It's actually been kinda nice, it's kinda cool and a little weird, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's been --
L:  Had a -- had a little twister down the road a few days ago.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  I -- yeah I know you're -- you're real familiar with those right?
R:  Yes, and it's been hot here, it was hot and humid today.
L:  [LAUGH] I hear ya.  Well, they want to know what we like better, ah -- eating at home, or eating out.
R:  Well, I do both.  I like eating out more now that I used to than eating at home.
L:  Well, that's exactly what I was thinking, I like eating out more than I used to because I'm tireder now than I was, and you have more choice, you know?
R:  Yes.  I love to go out and eat Chinese food.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yes.
L:  My whole family -- that's one of their favorites too, Chinese is right on top of the list --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And up here in Utah we have Chinese places all over the place.
R:  Well we got but ah -- about ah, about three or four around where we are --
L:  W-, w- --
R:  The nearest place to go to a really great one would be Dallas, but -- ah, we've got one that's pretty good in our little small town and stuff that we go to quite a bit --
L:  What, w- --
R:  -- they have a great buffet.
L:  What town are you in?
R:  I'm close to Innes[?], Texas.
L:  Innes --
R:  I'm about forty five miles south of Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay.  I know Beaumont, but ... don't know --
R:  Ah yeah, it's close to Huston --
L:  Oh, I was born in Texas actually, but I --
R:  Oh, were you [LAUGH].
L:  -- I haven't lived there, yeah, since I was a baby, so -- in El Paso --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  [MN] So --
R:  It's been really hot there, too.
L:  Ah, it's -- it's actually been cooler up here in Utah than usual, and, speaking of eating out, we actually ate out -- they took me out ah, last Friday to ... it's a new fish place, it's called Joes.
R:  Oh, I bet that was good.
L:  It was -- it was really good I'd like to go there and get, ah, the -- the shrimp in the sauce, you know the butter sauce --
R:  Well, actually we ate out all weekend ah, there was a few of us, we went down to -- we had to go to Arkansas, to a wedding, and then we went to Bouger[?], and went to Louisiana and went gambling --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we ate at the Horseshoe -- it's one of the ah, buffets and their breakfast buffet was excellent for seven ninety five --
L:  Wow, the --
R:  -- it was all you could eat.
L:  Did they have a lot of like, ah, fish?
R:  They had a lot of veg- -- they had a lot of fruits out, you know, like strawberries, they had strawberries dipped in chocolate and they had the croissants and the, ah, french toast sticks, and they had eggs and bacon and hash browns and --
L:  Well, we know you ate breakfast [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, they had all that and right now I'm fighting a weight problem [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I -- I'm kinda watching -- I've been eating all the Weight Watchers too at home but ah, I -- I [inaudible] -- I like to go out to eat.  I love Taco Bell, too.
L:  Well, I u- -- --
R:  I like tacos [LAUGH].
L:  -- well I -- I used to love Taco Bell, in fact, when they first opened a long time ago I actually helped -- I was a [LIPSMACK] -- a supervisor on one of the shifts --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and I used to love it to the way they made their food and stuff but -- they're a little different now and we do go occasionally, but it's not my favoritest [LAUGH].  We've got another place up here called Taco Time --
R:  [MN]
L: -- and ah, we like to go there better than Taco Bell because --
R:  Well, we've got a -- we've recently [inaudible] -- we've got a Chili's and -- and ah, ah, we've got Golden Corral -- and ah, now that's a good place to go and I like to go to Golden Corral and eat too --
L:  Yeah, that -- we have those up here.
R:  Because they have a big variety -- ah, and, and, they're also ah, put in a [inaudible], it's a Mexican place that's pretty good.
L:  Is it like real, real Mexican food [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah, --
L:  The thing I've noticed --
R:  -- they fought for a long time to get this place put in.
L:  Well, this ah -- that's one of my favorites in fact, that's what I specialize in cooking 'cause my husband was Spanish, and back in New Mexico where I come from -- ooh, the Mexican food there is -- well you might call it New Mexican, it's just so good --
R:  Yeah, I bet it is good.
L:  -- but up here yeah, there's actually a lot of Mexican people that have come from Mexico up here and ah, everything is just like full of cheese --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- no chili, they didn't -- I ordered some [inaudible] once with red chili and they go, "Red sauce?", and I go, "No, red chili", and they didn't even know what that was, but they did wind up making a red, you know, ah, I guess a red paste out of powdered chili --
R:  Well, see now I like seafood too and I like -- I like boiled shrimp --
L:  Oh ye- --
R:  -- with a baked potato and a salad --
L:  Oh ye- --
R:  I'd rather go down to Pier Nineteen in Huston whenever we get a chance to go down there, which we try to go every summer, and I think we're going next month, and go to Galveston and go eat at Pier Nineteen and it is great down there -- the food down there is really good, yeah --
L:  Oh, I bet -- that's my food -- that's what I had ah Friday, was the broiled shrimp.
R:  Oh, I bet that was good.
L:  It -- it, well it actually was -- we -- we -- we really like Joes a lot -- we don't go there too often though 'cause it is kind of a little more expensive, so -- we go to Skippers occasionally, but they don't have broiled shrimp [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We, we, we don't hit too many of the higher priced places but you mentioned Golden Corral and we have those up here and that's one of our places to go like -- to eat out, because it's, it's kind of reasonable, you know.
R:  Well, there for a while we were going almost every Saturday night to eat out at Golden Corral, but my husband's working a lot on Saturday nights now, and, we don't have the chance to go very much now.  We just usually grab whatever we've got handy here at home or whatever and then sometimes we go out to eat now, sometimes we don't, it just depends.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  'Cause I got my son and my daughter in law living with us right now too, and they're just starting out, they just -- they haven't been married that long, you know --
L:  W- --
R:  -- so -- but we like, Tracey and I like to go whenever we get a chance.
L:  Well, that's a coincidence, 'cause my daughter and my son in law live with me 'cause it's just my daughter and myself and -- my husband passed away a few years ago and ah, she wanted to go to school up here and it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was most reasonable to sell out back home and move up here, so that's what I did and she's only been married a couple of years -- three years or so --
R:  Well, they'll be married two years in October -- I think that they like ah Chinese food also.
L:  Oh, mine do too, they just love to go eat Chinese, so, we like to go --
R:  But they like pizzas and my son, he loves shrimp --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's another thing we do.  We do on weekends also get, ah, it's called Papa Johns, it is the best pizza around, I mean, it tops any other pizza I've ever had.
R:  Well, the nearest one we've got a Papa Johns I think's in Dallas --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and we don't go up there very often to eat.
L:  That's kinda a long ways to go for pizza [LAUGH] -- and I bet you they don't deliver.
R:  Yeah -- no, but we've got Dominoes close by and we've got Pizza Hutt.  Ah, Dominoes is pretty good down here.  Ah, my son worked for a whole -- oh, f- -- used to work for Mister Jims[?], he's worked for Dominoes, he's worked for Mr Gettys[?] and he's worked for Pizza Hut [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I used to have some friends that ran a Pizza Hut and it used to be really good, but up here -- yeah well they just opened a new one and it's better than what the older one was that was just down the street, but I think Papa Johns beats them all --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so, and eating out, I don't know if it's just because we're older or what -- of course I'm on disability right now, so I'm at home, so I do cook a lot more often -- in fact, tonight we had tacos [LAUGH] -- so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- especially when it -- we get towards the broke time, you know --
R:  Yeah, at -- well, at night ah, my husband and my son work at the same place, they work three 'til eleven.  Tracey and I stay at home because they've got both of the cars and we're home on foot, out in the country and ah, we're both trying to work from home right now.
L:  What are you doing?
R:  Well, I do -- I started doing this today, ah -- I've been working with a call center, ah, with Angelique[?] R[?], just taking ah, inbound calls, ah, and taking credit card orders.  They -- they were shut down for quite a while and they just back on rolling in the last few weeks and --
L:  What a coinc- --
R:  -- the callers are just now, they're still real slow though right now 'cause the calls are coming in real slow --
L:  What a coincidence -- I worked at a call center up here and that's what I'm off of work from right now --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we actually sold ah, hand helds and it has really been slow, in fact our facility has gone from like a thousand people down to about a hundred --
R:  Oh my.
L:  So, it has just been that way all over -- and part of the reason we're in -- we're in the technology business so -- isn't that a coincidence though [LAUGH]?
R: Yeah, my son he just finished getting his certificate of completion for information technology
