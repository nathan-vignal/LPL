R:  Hi, I'm Sita[?].
L:  And my name is Rose.  Well ...
R:  How are you doing today?
L:  I'm doin' fine.  How are you?
R:  Good, ah [LAUGH], so do you like eating at home better or at restaurants?
L:  Well, for convenience and if I don't have to cook I like to eat in a restaurant, but for the quality of food I'd rather eat at home.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I like to eat at home, I feel more comfortable -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in my own surroundings --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, at a restaurant, that's nice once in a while, but I prefer at home.
L:  Yeah, and besides that I think I eat a bet-, a better quality of food and I'm more conscious of what I'm eating.
R:  Yeah, and you know what you're cooking, you know what's done to your food.
L:  And smaller portions than I -- what you get in a restaurant, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when you go to a restaurant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they give us a large plate of food I feel like I should eat this because it's -- it's costing me a lot of money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and yet it's way too many calories of what I need so I can watch my diet and eat better and stay healthier if I eat at home.
R:  Right.  I completely agree with that. 
L:  Course it is nice to go out and not have to do the dishes or cook or whatever, 'specially if you work outside the home, you know.
R:  That's true, and it's sometimes more convenient to eat out than to come home and actually cook -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- if you have like an odd working schedule, it's just easier to stop by a place and eat or meet up with friends and eat, or if you get invited out to a place you're like, "Oh yeah, I might as well go, you know, when will I eat again, eat out again" so you might --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you just go with your friends, you're like, "Yeah, I'll go".
L:  But I think there's entirely too much advertising on restaurants and how great the food is and -- and you know how reasonable it is "It's only ten dollars for this", but by the time you get your drink or you get your thing it's -- it's costing you fifteen, twenty dollars just for one person.
R:  True, it all adds up.
L:  Yeah, it really does and so that the -- what you get insofar as calories and quality of food is sometimes what you really don't need or don't want.
R:  Right, and sometimes they lie or hide the facts and then you really don't know what's in your food.
L:  Yes, yeah, and if you get -- well, some things they can't because it, like MSG and stuff like that if you get an allergy to it they could be in big trouble so they have to tell you if that's there, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I -- you know, I haven't been in the kitchen of very many restaurants but the ones or two that I have been through I don't think I'd want to have, I wouldn't eat my own food in that kitchen, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm like, "No, no, no, no" and the people they hire because of the salary they can pay and the wages they pay 'em are not always the cleanliest people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they don't bother to wash their hands each time or they don't wash the food properly and it's like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- yeah, I think I like eating at home much better, it -- it's --
R:  B- 
L:  -- and besides that it is more economical.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  They actually had a TV show on, um, people and what they do in the kitchens and after that [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I stopped eating out like for two months --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I think I saw that where the guy was, he was mad at the gr-, the people they were serving so they were spitting in food and everything else, and --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- oh, no, yuk.
R:  And I was like "Oh, what if they definitely do that to my food, I know they do, and then ..."
L:  Yeah, don't send that steak back even if you don't like it, eat it anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  That's what I do in restaurants too, if I don't even like the food I eat it anyway, I'm afraid to complain --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like when I'm at home I feel so much more comfortable eating in my own atmosphere, knowing how I cooked it, what was cooked, how it was cooked --
L:  Yes, absolutely, I agree with you.  And I -- it was also where you shop for food.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, there are certain stores that I won't shop in because I don't like -- they're -- they're not clean, they don't look as clean as I think they should be you know.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  [MN]
R:  And you're picking out food that looks healthy and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know it was cleaned right and you go to certain places [NOISE].
L:  Well, a lot of times even if they're cleaned, when you go into even the best stores because people are coming in and pick 'em up and look at it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then put it back down again, that, so when I bring it home I always wash my food very, very --
R:  Right.
L:  -- carefully [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, I do too.  I agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, in general I guess we like eating at home [LAUGH] better.
L:  Yeah, it'd be --
R:  I --
L:  -- nice if we had a cook [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, that would be great, a personal cook.
L:  Yeah, that'd be really great yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a personal shopper to do the cooking and bring it, yeah that'd be nice, but --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- but I do prefer to eat at home, and I take --
R:  Yeah, me --
L:  -- I take my lunch to work every day because I don't want to go out and eat lunch, you know.
R:  Right.  It's just healthier too to bring your own lunch.
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause you know how much you're eating and the quantity, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you made it yourself and if you go and buy it you get so much more and you feel obligated to eat it, you don't want to waste the food.
L:  You do, and besides that you always, you -- you're starving when you get to the restaurant so you'll say, "Oh super size" or you know, "Give me a large" -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you don't, and you don't need that and you, by the time you're not even finished with it you're saying "I don't really want this, but I'm not going to throw this away 'cause it cost me six or seven bucks so I'm gonna" --
R:  Right.
L:  --  "I'll go ahead and eat it" you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, so there again you just add wasted calories and that means more time on working out [LAUGH] --
R:  Right [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's like "Oh no" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And then you feel guilty and you work out like three hours the next day and then you go do the same thing because you didn't bring lunch --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I [several inaudible words] was one of the biggest things I do is that I have a salad every day with lunch, for my lunch salad and fruit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then I don't, then I won't worry so much about what I have for dinner at night, whatever I cook, you know, if -- if -- if it's a fried chicken or if it's like pan fried fish or whatever I eat --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whatever I cook is what we eat, I'm not concerned about you know, just for my family I say, "Okay, we're having this", or if I have spaghetti for instance, I [inaudible] spaghetti and not say "I can't have it, it's too many calories", so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- other than that it's um, because I do watch what I eat during the day type thing, and, and eating out does not help [MN] --
R:  Yeah, but sometimes you try to spoil yourself and you eat out regardless, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's nice once in a while, but not all the time.
L:  Well, if I want to spoil myself though, I want to go to a restaurant when I can get you know, get a salad, or get a decent, you know a decent restaurant, not just a fast food place, like you know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I kind of, kind of stay away from those anyway, I try to --
R:  Or ev-, or even buffets perhaps, but the foods been sitting out, so I don't know if I really agree with that.
L:  Well buffets are nice except for another thing and I find myself doing this, I go through a buffet and things that I don't cook at home because it's too much trouble or like desserts and things, I don't bake a lot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I end up eating more desserts, you know [LAUGH] it's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- okay, I'll have that today because I won't have it later, you know, but now, I -- I eat too much you know, 'cause everything's so good you know and I'm there early --
R:  Everything just tastes so great you just, oh, I might as well, just this once, then you do it the next time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the next time.
L:  If I'm there early.
R:  Right.
L:  If I'm there later, you know, at the later half of the lunch hour, like twelve thirty, one o'clock, one thirty or something then I'm like you, I don't, not real sure about it 'cause it's been sitting out there since eleven o'clock that morning you all think "No" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "I don't think I want to eat this", you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, food's a very interesting subject.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] it is [LAUGH].
L:  I never knew there were so much topics to be discussed on food.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Eating out or eating at home.  Hm.  Yeah.
R:  Eating at home though I just, I don't know, like I can be myself at home, like in a restaurant I kind of have to be like ooh, so proper in a way --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- like at home I can feel more laid back and [LIPSMACK] I'm just in my own surroundings, I feel just comfortable like I, you know --
L:  Did you ever notice when you're in a restaurant you tend to spill something on the front of your shirt, but at home I never do that?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  It must be the nerves or something, like, "Oh my God, I'm going to do it, I'm going to" -- and then it happens, you go --
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- 
R:  -- and spill something on you.
L:  You, you know, when you go out or something and you think, "I don't wear bibs at home, I don't need to wear this", but you, I'm very careful about what I order, like I don't want to order ribs or I don't want to order spaghetti because I know I'll splash [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Or they'll --
L:  -- I'll order lasagna because that can be cut up in small pieces or, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but --
R:  Or you don't want to order something when your breath will smell after and you're like, "Oh, I gotta walk around with that" and you're like ah --
L:  Oh yeah, well, that's not as much of a concern now 'cause they got those little +Listerine -- Listerine things that, those tab that you stick in your mouth --
R:  True.
L:  -- so that takes away some of it, but -- yeah, it's -- yeah, but you're right, especially if you have a hamburger with onions on, or something like that --
R:  Right, yeah and then you're like, "Ooh" --
L:  -- you've got to say, "Oh, no" -- yeah, you, and not only that you keep tasting it all afternoon and so you keep thinking, "Hm" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and you're like, "Oh, I got this funny taste in my mouth" [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] That's right, and I know my breath stinks, I know it's terrible, you know, I don't want to talk to anybody you know [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but even when I eat at home though if I have, 'cause if you have an onion on your hamburger at home you can go brush your teeth or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- use mouthwash or whatever, but, yeah, I'm very comfortable in my own home eating.
R:  Yeah I would definitely --
L:  Yeah, much prefer it.  Even if I decide to eat in front of the television, you know, bring my dinner in and sit down in front of TV --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm more comfortable doing that than I am eating in a restaurant.
R:  Yeah, I would ah even invite friends over to eat dinner rather than go out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes --
L:  Yeah, especially if they're going to do a potluck, okay -- we'll -- I'll do this and you do that, you know, makes it so much easier --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on everybody and you don't have to plan so much and cook so much.
R:  Yeah, and then everyone can bring something and you have your own little party [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, really [LAUGH].  Yeah, I -- I enjoy having people and -- to have something, even if it's just a light snacks or, you know, hors d'oeuvres or salads or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or, you know, it doesn't have to be a big heavy meal, but  -- or I'm really great with crock pot cooking, with that --
R:  Really, what's that? 
L:  Well, you, it's a crock pot, it's a -- a -- it's a piece of e- -- a kitchen appliance really --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you just put everything in a pot in the morning when you leave and turn it on low, when you come home at night and it's all done it's great -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- with like chicken and beef and chilies and stuff like that, it's really great you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  So -- and I use that quite a bit, so.
R:  Is that pretty healthy, or --
L:  Y -- yeah --
R:  -- it depends what you put in there and --
L:  -- it depends on what you put in it 'cause I can make chicken in it with vegetables like a chicken soup --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or I can make chili with like turkey, like a turkey chili which is very healthy, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't have the grease and the fat and th- you know.  Um, yeah, well, it's pretty good.
R:  Mm.
L:  Mm.  Although I think sometimes you, you can do pretty much what you want, you can put roast beef in there and beef is a lot heavier in fats and calories --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than chicken and stuff is, but ...
R:  True.
L:  Yeah, but you just put anything you want in it, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's called one pot cooking, you know, just that's it, it's all done, you know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] and then take the crock thing out and put it in the dishwasher and wash it up, so ...
R:  Mm.  Huh.
L:  Do you do a lot of cooking at home, or is it just ...?
R:  Um, not really, I'm usually, I do microwave foods, but ...
