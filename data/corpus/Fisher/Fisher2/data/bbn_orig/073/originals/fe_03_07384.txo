R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.  I'm Cindy First.
R:  Hello.  I'm Karen.
L:  Hi Karen.
R:  How are you?
L:  Okay.  How're you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- doing?
R:  [NOISE] Doing good.  Have you done this before?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay. [NOISE]  So, which do you think is worse? [NOISE]
L:  [MN] I think gossiping is the worst.
R:  Gossiping.  Yeah.  I think it hurts more people.
L:  Me too.
R:  I really think it does. [NOISE] It can -- if it's not truth then it's gonna cause a lot of problems for the person that you're talking about --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and the person that's gossiping.
L:  I agree.
R:  [MN] I do believe --
L:  It's just like poison.
R:  It is.
L:  It permeates.
R:  [NOISE] It -- it sure does because --
L:  It really is terrible.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know how you play the game when you're a child of gossip what goes around -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and it gets worse and worse and worse. [NOISE]
L:  I totally agree.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's like somebody once told me, when you -- when you gossip those who sling mud --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lose ground.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And I always really like that comment because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gossiping is so terrible.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I like that too. [NOISE] That's a good one to -- [NOISE]  to teach your children. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I have a three year old and [NOISE] I sure know that things [NOISE] can get turned around a lot. [NOISE]
L:  Sure.
R:  [MN] But --
L:  Do they -- does she run into a lot of problems with gossiping around her friends?  It's -- it's --
R:  Ah, not so much.  But I think [NOISE] a lot of it -- tattle tailing can even go into that gossiping part, you know? [NOISE]
L:  Sure.
R:  The -- the fish -- the fish stories get bigger and bigger. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] So that's part of it. [NOISE]
L:  Well, fish stories are okay as long --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as it's not gossiping.
R:  Well, I was gonna say, but -- but --
L:  Who's got a mean fish versus --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a good fish.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But if you have a bigger +fish than the other person --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then it's not gossiping, right?
R:  Right.  Right.  But -- Yeah, I think everybody has been part of gossiping of some sort before.
L:  I agree. 
R:  When I was, um, in high school I had a untrue rumor going around and it hurt really bad, you know?  And --
L:  I know.
R:  Even so bad that at the time my mother got involved and called the other parent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, I -- I would think -- I would never want anybody to do that but I was so upset that she did.  She thought it would be better to get it straightened out and of course it all --
L:  Well --
R:  -- turned to -- who knows where it actually came from but [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it got straightened out. [NOISE] But, yes it was very hurtful.
L:  It must have been very hurtful.  
R:  It was.  It was.
L:  Really, really hurtful.
R:  When you try to be a good person and then somebody says something bad about you, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  That's terrible.
R:  And it involved alcohol.  Even though, you know, that was supposed to be one of the topics too -- we should talk about alcohol and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'd never drink a drop in my life and somebody said that I had to drink something [NOISE] and I was --
L:  Aw.
R:  -- devastated. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Devastated.  Aw.
R:  Yes. [NOISE] Because my father is an alcoholic and the fact that I would, you know, go there after -- no, I didn't want anybody to think that, so 
L:  Aw.
R:  So, that's how the gossip hurt me really bad. [NOISE]
L:  That must have been terrible. 
R:  [NOISE] It was. [NOISE]
L:  I'm trying to think of my gossip stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that was bad --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I was a kid or even recently or --
R:  And what's bad is [NOISE] I have a mother in law that lives off of it, so 
L:  Oh.  There are people like that.  It's so sick.
R:  You know?  And you think how in the world -- I mean, there's no way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they could possibly know [NOISE] that what they're saying is truth.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  I had her even [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- she was telling me gossip this week about a church member of all things. [NOISE]  About their [SIGH] family and going in a little bit deeper into the family than they should have and saying that [NOISE] -- that it was possible that maybe, um -- that the husband was beating the pregnant wife.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And I thought, "Oh, my".  I was, like, "You don't even need to be telling me [NOISE] --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- any of this stuff" but -- or anybody else.  You know?  
L:  Wow.
R:  Even though I'm family -- you still don't need to repeat stuff like that.
L:  I know.
R:  Unless it came out of her mouth.
L:  I know.
R:  So, I think that's --
L:  Gossip can be pretty --
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty nasty.  I think sometimes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too it's just like their own --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, self esteem that they need to -- they need to talk about other people --
R:  About somebody else.
L:  -- to feel good.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  To feel good about them own --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- their own selves and stuff.
R:  [NOISE] I think that has -- typically that's what it is.
L:  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  [NOISE] So 
L:  So 
R:  Oh, oh. [SIGH] [NOISE] But -- [LAUGH] I have a three year old that's wanting everything so  [LAUGH]
L:  Aw.  Aw.
R:  [LAUGH] That's the problem that I am experiencing at the moment. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I can't do enough for her.  But [COUGH] --
L:  [MN] Oh, that's a -- a wild age.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't have children.
R:  [NOISE] You don't? [NOISE]
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] Could you think of any gossip about you that's caused problems?
L:  I'm trying to think because we have to get back on the subject.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] I -- let me think about gossip that's caused problems, like I'll stay on the subject -- gossip, gossip, gossip.
R:  Gossip, gossip. [SIGH]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know people said mean things, um, over the years but I can't remember thin- -- anything, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, actually, now I do have a story.  Um, I was married --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a very, very short time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, his, um [SIGH] -- my ex husband's fa- -- um, family are really good friends with my family.  So, I'm --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- like, [NOISE] good friends with his aunt too --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and his -- and his cousins and stuff. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he gets very uncomfortable --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when he's around me.  
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  Um, and so [LIPSMACK] he'd told Janey whose my girlfriend whose his first cousin --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- um, made up some BS about me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I was doing, which was, like, totally not true at all.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  And threatened that if I did this he was going to call the police.  Well --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- if I kept doing it, which was, like, totally -- I would never even do that, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I've never done that, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And so it was -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was only his own stuff because he had realized that I was, um -- I had not been as friendly with Janey over the last several years and then we kinda reconnected in the last three years.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  And then, you know, I'd like stayed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at her parent's house when the family went on this trip and stuff.  And I think he -- he gets really -- his -- his own self esteem stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he gets very jealous and he's got, like, this anger about him.
R:  Right.
L:  This undercurrent of anger.  And so I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was just to gossip because he, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he just needs to do that.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  And th- that was kinda, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it didn't bother me because it -- it didn't hurt me because I know that's John.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  But it's like I could've done without that.  You know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's another part of his BS.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Right. [NOISE] I know.  I don't --
L:  But, ah --
R:  But then -- and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I think that's a lot of times when it does, like -- I have a lady in my neighborhood that if you don't wanna know anything about anybody let me tell you [NOISE] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if you don't want to know it she's going to be telling you anyway.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And I think [LAUGH] she hears -- she tries to be friends with some many people so she can just get stuff off of them so she can repeat it to someone else.
L:  Eh.
R:  And she told me [LAUGH] this neighbor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that neighbor were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- having problems and they were going to get a divorce.  And then this other neighbor [NOISE] they were going to get a divorce, and all these things and I thought, "How do you know all this stuff?  And why would you tell me --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- that doesn't even know those people --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- well enough for it to matter?"  You know?  
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, not that I want anybody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to have problems but she doesn't know those people either.  So [LAUGH] it's probably all gossip from the very beginning. [NOISE]
L:  Wow.
R:  But, I don't understand [SIGH] -- like, you said I think [NOISE] it goes down with self esteem. [NOISE]   She's had marriage problems before. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] She's had a problem so she wants to have other people have them so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's what a lot [NOISE] of it is. [NOISE] 
L:  That's crazy.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  I -- a friend of mine was, um, in this business --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was in this business with this friend of mine and it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a really, really tight quote sales business and everybody knew everybody.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And so people are always, like, making up stuff --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- about people and it was really sick. 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So she decided that she was going to see how fast the gossip could go around the city.  Yeah, there was --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  You know -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which is really sick but she -- it was just sort of, like, a fun thing to do.  In kind of --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- a demented way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just because it just shows how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people gossip so much and it's like a sport for people.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she decided to say that she was leaving town because she was getting married.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And she was leaving town and she was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going to be leaving within a month or whatever.
R:  Oh, my goodness. [NOISE]
L:  It took exactly not even twenty four hours [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- for that to go around.  And it went all the way around until somebody said to her, "So, I understand --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- that you're leaving town?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "You gave notice and you'll leaving town".  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And she's like, bingo, got ya.  You know?
R:  [LAUGH] Ah.  Yeah.
L:  And it went around to so many different people.  So many people knew about it.
R:  Well, I guess --
L:  And that's how sick the gossip stuff.
R:  I think another thing is at times I have thought about the people that are, like my mother in law, she has a tendency to [SIGH] tell little white lies, I guess you would call them, [NOISE] or say things that there's no way that she knows --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything about, so that's just pure gossip.  And I have many times thought about saying, "Do you know that so and so said this about you?" [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know, to say, "How's that feel?" [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  When there's [NOISE] no way that that's the truth.  So --
L:  Not right.
R:  -- how do you know that about anything else. [NOISE]
L:  Huh.
R:  But she, um [NOISE] -- yeah, I've often thought to do that.  And my husband says I should because of the fact that she does go around --
L:  But then --
R:  -- talking about everybody so much. [NOISE]
L:  -- you'd be back in her place.
R:  Right.  Right. [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  So.
R:  [NOISE] But I don't know if it would -- if it would work or not.  Then she was --
L:  I don't know.  Then she'd gossip about you for making up the gossip.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]  "Do you know that Karen came and told me story that" [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God.  I think it's cool that we both picked the same thing.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That gossip is the worst because so many people could be, like, you know, really weird, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, smoking is so terrible.  Well, I don't know.  I think gossiping is so much more damaging.
