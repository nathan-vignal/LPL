R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  
R:  Hi.  Uh, my name is Abbey.
L:  Hey.  [NOISE]  It's -- may I help you?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Hello, can I help you?
R:  Uh, oh, this -- um, it's a phone study.  Did you hear the briefing?
L:  No.  Uh-uh, my son answered the phone so I don't know what's going on.  
R:  Oh.  It's, um, it's the Fisher phone study.  They're trying -- they just do random conversations on different topics and give you money for them.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Have you done one of these before?
L:  No, I haven't.  Uh-uh.  
R:  Oh, okay.  I guess someone in your house signed up for them.  
L:  Uh, right.
R:  [MN]  I've only done one and we're supposed to talk about food and whether we like eating at --
L:  Oh, you know --
R:  -- home --
L:  Oh, okay.  So you're actually --
R:  -- or a restaurant.
L:  [LAUGH]  So you're actually the person I'm supposed to talk to?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've got ya.  Okay, I know what you're talking about.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I signed up a long time ago but I'm never at home so my son answered the phone so I'm thinking --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He's telling me something.  I thought you were a telemarketer so I was like ...  [LAUGH]  I didn't know what was going on.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  All right.  I'm sorry.  Back from --
R:  Oh, don't worry about it.
L:  -- square one. 
R:  It's fine. 
L:  All right, what are we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- supposed to talk about.  
R:  Um, food.  
L:  Food.
R:  And --
L:  Oh, that's my favorite topic. 
R:  [inaudible] -- yeah, no, I was like, "Oh, I'll take this call".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  I love food.  That's my favorite.  All right, so ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  We're talk -- supposed to talk about going out to eat or ...?
R:  Yeah, like whether you like to cook your own meals or like to go out to eat or whatever.
L:  Okay.  Actually I like to cook my own meals.  I like to cook from scratch so ...  I know --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  And I'm a coupon bargainer so what I do is I end up getting my groceries from free and then I cook from scratch what I've got.  
R:  Right.
L:  But -- except --
R:  It's --
L:  -- for like one night a week I got out to eat.
R:  -- so much healthier that way.  
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah, I just actually finished cooking myself dinner.  I made macaroni and cheese with veggies and ...
L:  Oh, man. 
R:  Um, I'm -- I'm a college student so I'm just learning how to cook for myself and I get so excited, you know, even if it's the most simple recipe.  
L:  Right, and that's why --
R:  I'm like, yes, I did something.
L:  Um --
R:  I can feed myself.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right 'cause when I started out cooking, let's see, [LIPSMACK] first thing I cooked was, um, beef.  And then I learned you had to, um, cook it for a long time to get it tender.  And I cooked --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a roast that my husband had in his freezer when we got married.  And I cooked it for about forty five minutes and then we ate it.  It was like so tough.  [LAUGH]  He couldn't chew it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So I had to -- like I started getting cookbooks and, um, learning how to cook and it's just a lot of fun.  I grew up -- where are you from?
R:  Um, I actually go to school in Philadelphia but I'm from California.
L:  You're from California.  So I'm over here way in North Carolina.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, good ol' southerners.  You know, we eat fried chicken and all the artery clogging foods.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, um --
R:  Oh, it's so good.  Actually we, um, are the outer banks in North Carolina?
L:  Right.  Uh-huh, yeah, outer banks.  Yeah, Atlantic Beach.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah, um, I actually had some friends who wanted to go down there and it was during fi- -- like the week before finals and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I decided not to go because I knew I wasn't going to get any studying, but they said it was so nice down there and, like, just perfect. 
L:  Oh, yeah, it's -- it's neat.  Yeah, I like the beach.  I grew up [inaudible] the beach so ...  And I like seafood.  My daddy, um, he deep sea fishes for a living.  Now that he's retired.  And, um, he just catches fish and catches fish and so, um ...
R:  Oh, yum.
L:  I need to eat more.  That's -- that's what they said to eat for your heart, you know.  'Cause of the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- omega fatty acids but, um, you just eat so much --
R:  Yeah, that is --
L:  -- of it 'til you get sick of it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Yeah, but that's, you know, that's good 'cause you know it's like fresh, you know.  
L:  Right.
R:  Like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- right, [LAUGH] you know, you just got it.
L:  You know, what you're getting.
R:  Fresh as it get.  Yeah.  
L:  Right.  Because that's what everything since all this war stuff broke out, well, then we and my husband are thinking last couple a years, because he grew up on a farm and I grew up kinda mid city, I say.  And, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we'd love to grow our own, um, 'course we started our own garden this year.  Have a nice big garden.  And, um, we'd love to raise our own produce and, um --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- raise our own, like, [LIPSMACK] our goal was to move further back out into the country and get some cattle and pigs and chickens and -- and see if we can do, like, farm life.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  But I'd love for my children to learn it.  You never know when we might need it one day.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  No, it's -- it's so much better.  It -- it teaches you to, you know, when you do your own thing, you know, you appreciate what you're given, you -- you understand the process.  You know, you just have so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- much more appreciation for your food.  
L:  That's right.  So that's what I'm learning --
R:  You know.
L:  -- now, the canning process.  So, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  We started last year and I made my first pear preserves.  Have you ever had any?
R:  [MN]  My mom makes peach preserve.  
L:  Oh, they're so good.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So [several inaudible words] have a friend with a pear tree and we made pear preserves.  I put those up and they are absolutely delicious.  
R:  [MN]  
L:  So, um ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, my -- my grandmother lives in a farm in Mexico and she knows -- she knows how to cook from scratch and she makes the best preserves.  She has, um, like different trees and -- kind of like an orchard.
L:  Right.  
R:  So she, you know, she just picks the fruits and she knows exactly what to do with them and it's always so good.
L:  It is good -- good when you can get something fresh.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, oh God, I have another phone call.  I don't know if I can take it if I'm doing this study.  I guess not.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, and I'm like --
L:  It's like give me my --
R:  -- courting and --
L:  -- money back.  And I wonder how much --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So are they listening to our phone conversations?  Is that what they're doing?  
R:  I think they just tape them and they, like, I don't know, I think they're -- I don't know what they're doing.  I guess, I think it has to do with like reg- regional, like, accents or ...
L:  Right.  
R:  You know, I -- I don't know what it is.  'Cause they -- they -- I remember when I first signed up they asked a lot of questions like whether [MN] English was my first language and things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that.  So ...
L:  Right.  I remember.  It's been so long ago.  
R:  Yeah.  So I think -- I don't know, I guess just --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- differences in 
L:  That's --
R:  -- speech --
L:  That's neat.
R:  -- or something.
L:  At least I know what to expect now.  That was my --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  That was my seven year -- well, he's eight now but he is so grown and he's [LAUGH] he was funny.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He's [inaudible].  
R:  Yeah, and it's funny 'cause sometimes they pick up the phone and you don't know who they're talking to either, you know. 
L:  Right.  He said, "Momma, hurry up and tell her if you like to go out to eat or if you like to cook".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I was like, "What?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I said, oh, man, it's a telemarketer.  But, um ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  So no, um, [LIPSMACK] -- what else can I say?
R:  I hate telemarketers.  Especially when they call around dinnertime.
L:  Right.  
R:  Oh, please.  
L:  And now they -- they can't call past nine so now they call five minutes 'til nine.  So, um ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But I got my phone number unlisted for about a year and, um, that cut 'em out really.  I've just got --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- my number back listed about three months ago and I haven't had the first call.  
R:  Yeah. Um, and -- and I hate those things.  You know, 'cause it's like, you know, you have things to do.  You know, especially you.  If you have children you're like I'm trying to put my children to bed and they're trying to sell you something and that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the last thing you're thinking about, you know.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, let's see.  
R:  And I always feel so rude hanging up on them but it's like I -- I -- I can't --
L:  [LAUGH]  No. 
R:  -- I'm not buying.  Just please leave --
L:  That's right.  
R:  -- me alone.
L:  Yeah, that's right.  They're getting paid.  [LAUGH]  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] my husband tries to keep 'em on the telephone 'cause I didn't know they get paid per call in addition to what they sell.  So he'll try to keep 'em on the phone for as long as possible --
R:  Oh, so they can -- so they can get paid --
L:  -- and miss -- miss sales.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for like a call completed or something?
L:  Right.  So they get -- well, actually so they can miss sales 'cause as long as they're talking to you and you're bull crapping with 'em they're not making sales with other people or making calls.  
R:  Oh.
L:  He tries to --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- keep 'em on there as long as possible.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He is so funny.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  That's a good tactic.  
L:  Yeah, I know.  It's like what in the world are you doing?  When he told me I said, that's a good idea.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Anyway, um --
R:  You're [inaudible] someone else.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
R:  Oh --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- that's funny.  
L:  Let's see.  I guess --
R:  More food.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] and eating out.  I guess you being a college student.  I had a friend one time.  All she ate was, um, those Roman[?] noodles.  Oodles of noodles.
R:  [MN]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause they're --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- cheap.
R:  I've definitely had --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my fair share.  [LAUGH] 
L:  She ate 'em like three or four times a day.  She actually lost a lot of weight.  But, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's -- that's a easy meal.  Especially -- talking about Roman noodles.  I take those and cook, um, take chicken breasts and cut it up and then get a box of those, um, green giant, um, teriyaki vegetables.  They're in a box frozen.  And --
R:  Oh and just --
L:  -- stir fry it all together.
R:  -- mix it all up?
L:  Oh.  Yeah, and it's so good.  And then take --
R:  Oh, yum.  I've --
L:  -- those, um --
R:  -- never had them.  
L:  And put those Chinese noodles --
R:  I always have --
L:  They're good.
R:  Yeah, I always have them just in the cup with the flavoring.  You just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- add -- add the hot water.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]  The easy way.  [LAUGH]  Right?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But I cook them that way and actually use their flavoring pack and mix all that stuff together.  And it is good.  It's a quick little meal and it's not really that much fat.  You know -- you know, just the sodium but ...  Hey, drink the water --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it goes away.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I -- yeah, I [MN] -- I don't eat out very often.  Just because it gets really expensive 'cause -- I mean, the food's more expensive but, you know, you also have to tip and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all that stuff.  It -- it -- it adds up a lot, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  It really does.  Since --
R:  So ...
L:  Since I've been in --
R:  You know, for --
L:  -- this -- this --
R:  -- birthdays or special occasions but ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Well, we have, um, over here we have those peeler books.  I don't know if you all have 'em.  [MN]  They're like coupon books where you can take 'em to a store and you get like buy one get one free or something.  
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
L:  You can eat really cheap.  We do that a lot.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  And then I'm a big coupon addict so I get my groceries just about for free.  So ...
R:  Oh, that's -- yeah.  
L:  So if you never get into couponing and -- and -- and that stuff, you can really just rack up.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  What I do is I -- like you know how different res- different chains have memberships?
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, if you get like -- if they have it on sale you get it for like the sale price.  So I -- I do that a lot.  So ...
L:  Right.  The minute you get into couponing you can -- you can coupon and a lot of places double or triple.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And you can end up getting it free.  
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, the other week I got a hundred and fifty dollars --
R:  So, wait you --
L:  -- worth of groceries for ten dollars and fifty cents.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Wait, wait.  So in -- in, like in addition to the sale that they may have you can still use the coupon?
L:  Right.  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]  
L:  And then in places like -- like, I don't know if you have an Eckerd Drug.  Eckerd's Drugstore?  
R:  No.  
L:  But some kind of drugstore where they'll run their sale.  It'll say the store coupon and then you can use that coupon plus your manufacturer's coupon in addition to it.  A lot of people don't know that.  So you can actually --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [MN] so they give a two dollar off coupon and you have another two dollar off coupon from the manufacturer, and you're actually saving four dollar
