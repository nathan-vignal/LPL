L:  Hi, my name's Michael.
R:  Hi, I'm Patty.
L:  Hi Patty.
R:  I'm here in Philadelphia.  Where are you?
L:  Oh, down here in Washington, we just got swamped by a big ah, thunderstorm or something like that.
R:  Oh, is that right?  Wow.  My son goes to school in Seattle, so he probably got part of it.
L:  Oh, the other Washington.  Yeah I'm in Washington DC.
R:  Oh, you're DC, wow.  I didn't think that they'd call anybody so late. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  I thought they --
L:  -- I mean, um, I only can because I um, I do telephone fundraising.  I'm up till, like, I've been in till ten o'clock, so --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  I'm on a late schedule here.
R:  Oh I see, okay.
L:  Just raising money for nonprofit groups, Democratic Party candidates, all kinds of fun stuff like that.
R:  Oh boy.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Well, I hope I can remember these questions.  Something about the seasons changing and do you get sick.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I grew up in Florida so I didn't have to deal with the change of seasons down there, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- since I've been in Washington, ah, I don't know, I definitely do, ah, I get sick with the change of seasons, especially this last one.
R:  Oh do you really?  Huh, that's interesting.  I --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- I -- I -- I generally -- usually I live in Utah, I've been doing some travel nursing, I'm a nurse.  So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I'm out here in Philly now but I don't -- the only time I get sick with the season, ah, sometimes I get a sinus infection in the spring and it's usually brought on because I have so many allergies --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so even with allergy pills sometimes it's just enough to kick it off and throw it into a whole infection kind of deal --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- but ah, and I don't think it does any good at all to go to the doctor for a cold. [LAUGH] Although sometimes you don't know it's just a virus, and you know, then they'll tell you, but ah, you know, generally if I get sick enough that I'm running a temp and I'm really, you know, starting to feel sick I generally go and get on antibiotic and it helps within a day so I know it wasn't a virus. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, the last time I went to the doctor's they go antibiotic wouldn't help, and just gave me um, a prescription for an [inaudible] medication --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I felt that was, like, god, what a waste of -- waste of time and money, you know, because [several inaudible words] get allergy --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, he gave me a [inaudible] but I was just like, okay, [several inaudible words] antibiotic.  I only go to drugs if I think they can prescribe something to me to help me.
R:  Right.  Right, and I've had that happen too, where I've taken my daughter in and -- and ah, you know, she was really sick and -- and then emergency room.  It was like a, oh, one of those institute[?] places --
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.
R:  -- oh no, we've seen lots of this.  It's just a virus and stuff and she was just getting ready to start college and she was really not feeling well at all and so, um, fortunately we have family members who were positioned so we had a brother call in a prescription for it, even though it was in another state, they still accepted it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's definitely a good way to go.
R:  Yeah, I've done that before, too.  The last time I got a really bad sinus infection, I was just flying between Arizona and, um, Philly, with a -- a stop off in Chicago and I met my husband and he brought me a C-pack from his brother. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So that helped, but ah, I -- I don't know why the seasons would -- change of seasons would make you sick, unless it's just that you're not -- I -- I can't imagine --
L:  Well I think part of it relates to like, for example, um, in my household growing up, I was really good about, you know, using the dishwasher and keeping the kitchen clean and stuff like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, the thing is now I like, live in a house, and share a house with a couple of people and we don't use a dishwasher --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and um, once my mother suggested that I did and since then I've been just um, you know, keeping the place to myself and that's kept me a lot healthier.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing too, is I find I get sick more just if I'm around a lot, of course, you know, being a nurse I am around a lot of sick people --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but I generally stay healthy with that, but if I'm in close contact, like you say, living with people and everybody's sick and they're all touching, you know, the same things that's usually when I get -- when I get it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although I did, we went to um -- and we did go from cold weather to um, hot weather, although you wouldn't think that that would necessarily make you sick, but my -- my husband and I went to Saint Martin and all of a sudden out of the blue, like, the day before I left, I totally lost my voice.  Couldn't even talk and then I got this deep, chesty cough and it's just when SARS was just at its worst and here I am --
L:  Oh no.
R:  -- flying home, and every time I coughed I just wanted to crawl under the seat. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because I knew people were just going to panic, you know, because I sounded terrible.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Um it was just deep, and worse and -- and it was just a viral thing, and who knows who I got it from.  I didn't -- I wasn't around anyone who was sick as far as I knew.
L:  Hm.
R:  But it -- I -- you know, you can pick up illness like that, you know, viruses you can pick up just from touching handles -- door handles and things like that.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  And there's other theories as well, I mean, like, viruses haven't always been the accepted medical, you know, look at things.
R:  Right.
L:  Like for example, Eastern medicines, you know, where they do like, energy healing, you know, all that stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- acupuncture.  Um, lately there's other treatments they can use to like, break off colds and things like that, like, prevent them from happening.
R:  Oh yeah.  Well, and I -- I --
L:  So, ah, yeah.
R:  -- I really think there's something to some of that.  I know that when you're under a lot of emotional strain.  I was, you know, sick more probably this last year than I have been in a long time even though it wasn't very much, but ah, still, I generally don't get sick at all and a lot of it was stress.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so if you -- you're subjected to a lot of stress you get sick very easily.  Your resistance is down, first -- you know, when you're in a good state of mind you exercise you're healthy, and spiritually and emotionally, I think that you do stay a lot healthier, you know.
L:  I think there's definitely a link, like, um, especially up north, I'd noticed pretty susceptible to ah, like seasonal affective disorder.
R:  Oh, sure, yeah.
L:  And um, I mean, it's much more pronounced in northern states than southern states in winter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um, even a couple of cloudy days in a row can be enough to have a [inaudible] impact on moods and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I discovered often times um, Saint John- -- John's Wart works very well.  It's an anti depressant and anti viral, as well.
R:  What is it?
L:  Saint John's Wart.  You know, the herbal supplement. 
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  And um, and Echinacea works for things where there's a lot of mucus.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's um, believe it or not, it's actually an all natural antibiotic.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've taken that.
L:  I find that one works really well.
R:  And zinc.  I just will take, instead of taking like whole Cs[?] which doesn't have quite as much zinc I'll just take the zinc tablets and they're -- I can only take a half of one at a time but if I feel something coming on, I'll take that and it usually clears within a day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but ah, it -- you have to watch it, it'll make you throw up. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  It upsets your stomach and m- -- you know, some of my family members can't take it at all.  They just get too sick with it, but it -- it really works fast.  It -- it's a quick remedy, unfortunately, when I was -- when I was in Saint Martin I didn't have any --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and then this lady who was, ah, from the islands there, she gave me -- it was French.  It was written in French because they have a French side and a -- and a Dutch side, and um, she gave me this medicine and it was like an antibacterial type of thing --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and she said there are lozenges you put under your tongue.  I didn't have a clue what they were, she was -- she was in a jewelry store and she just heard me coughing and she asked me what I was doing about it --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and she gave me these -- these tablets and sa- -- told me to take, like, three the first day and then a couple.  It may have helped a little, I'm not positive if it -- I mean, the cough, I still have a little lingering cough --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's been over a month and a half now.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, so it --
L:  Yeah I was -- I was sick almost the entire winter it seems like.
R:  Oh.  Well, and -- and , you know, I think when -- when the weather is gloomy like that it's depressing and then ah, you know, another reason you get the depression added in and then you get, you know, you tend to get sick, but that's why I thought you were from Washington State because it rains so much there. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, we've had um, we had three and a half feet of snow --
R:  Yeah, I know.  Philly got it too.  I wasn't here but I -- my daughter got snowed in on her birthday, couldn't even go to dinner. [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  But, ah, yeah and it -- and it's rained.  We -- I got here May, like first I think, or second, and um, it rained just -- it seems like it's just rained for the last, you know, two or three weeks almost solid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you'll get a couple of days that are nice and then it'll rain again.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So everything looks great, but um, I couldn't live in a place that's um, where it was rainy, like Seattle, where my son's going to school.  It just -- it rains so much and you wake up and it's pitch black --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it --and it's just dark all day and gloomy, and it rains --
L:  Is it any wonder that the [inaudible] groups came from, you know, out there in a rainy gloomy place 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Ah, maybe that explains the raspy voice, they always had a cold, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  But yeah, it seems to be raining all um, all spring here in Washington and stuff and I think the allergies, um, and I've also heard like, change of temperatures ah, can affect your immune system as a whole, um, as well, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- like when it gets cold there you're more susceptible to viruses because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- body heat actually helps.  That's why you get a fever when you get sick.
R:  Yeah, I remember the studies they did on mice with that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, they -- when they were subjected to intense cold
