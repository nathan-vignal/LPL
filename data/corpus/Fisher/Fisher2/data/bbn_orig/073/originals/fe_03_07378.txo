R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi. [SIGH] Ah, my name's Dara.
L:  I'm Lisa.  Hi Dara. [LAUGH]
R:  This is my first call so 
L:  Oh, good.  I'm so glad.  It's mine too.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, good.  I -- I'm --
L:  I was like, "Oh, this could be hideous". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I was thinking.  I was sitting there going, "All right" [NOISE] Yes.  You can have a Chester Hoy[?] cookie".  I'm sorry.  That was my child. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's okay.
R:  In that, ah -- I didn't get all the things that they said w- -- about, ah, gossiping [inaudible] --
L:  Gossiping, um, smoking, drinking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or c- caffeine to excess, or -- I didn't -- I don't remember the last one.
R:  Last one. [SIGH] Gosh.  That one, [NOISE] I don't know.  I don't smoke so smoking's a big problem with me. [NOISE] Um, not that it -- I have a problem with smoking [NOISE] if anybody smokes that doesn't, ah, phase me at all.  
L:  Right.
R:  It's, um, [NOISE] [MN] if I'm somewhere where I don't want to be around it and they smoke that does drive me crazy.
L:  Well, thankfully, it seems like places are getting more and more willing to just say, "Hey, you know, if you're gotta do it --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- go outside".
R:  'Cause I've been told [NOISE] my gossiping is probably my worst, ah, [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- habit. [LAUGH]  'Cause I --
L:  Well, it depends on if it's something really juicy or not.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And that's true.  And I -- I seem to have a -- a -- the fun of gossiping all the time. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Where are you from?  I love your accent.
R:  Oh, I'm from Alabama.
L:  Ooh.  I'm in Texas.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, cool.
L:  But I'm new to Texas.  I just came here from Maryland to get married about, ah, six months ago so I haven't picked up the -- I don't feel like I have an accent at all.  I love southern.
R:  Oh, really?  An- and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And some- sometimes it takes me listening to myself, like, on a, um, answer machine to actually remember what I sound like as far as the twang [NOISE] and the -- the southern type. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I think it sounds nice.  So I don't know.  I mean, I think my only -- I mean, I drink and my husband --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, doesn't and I know there's been times where I've been like designated driver with my girlfriends after work --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and they're so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- obnoxious when it's my turn to drink coke.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And they're all having a good time and [LAUGH] cutting up.
R:  And that's true too.  I end up -- always end up being the designated driver from [NOISE] -- for when I go out with my friends just because I have kids at home and [SIGH] -- and I'm a single parent so I never get to drink unless I know for sure somebody's gonna be at home to stay at home. [NOISE]
L:  Well, that makes total sense.  But I can't wait to drop those people off.
R:  Oh.  I can --
L:  And I'm sure they think the same thing about me when it's not my turn. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  It's like, "We're taking you home first". [LAUGH]
R:  I have -- I have a really good friend and I love her to death and when she drinks to excess it's, like, "Go away". [SIGH] You know?
L:  Well -- and then there's the silly little bit obnoxious but still cute excess but then I hear sometimes -- and I don't know if it's stereotypical or not, but you hear a lot about, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the man of the house who gets kinda nasty when he drinks.
R:  My ex husband was that way.  I would never go -- when he'd want to go to the bars, um, I was like, "You go ahead.  I'll stay at home". [LAUGH] 'Cause --
L:  Well -- and did you feel like when he got home that it was up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to you to kinda keep things --
R:  Yes.  I had to be really [NOISE] -- anything would just pee him o- --
L:  Set him off?
R:  Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  My first husband was like that.  I felt on egg shells, like, [SIGH] I needed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to make everything nice until --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he just frigging fell asleep and then, phew.
R:  Mhm.  Yep.  And then --
L:  So, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think the drinking to excess part.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the smoking part I understand the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I used to smoke and I understand the second hand part. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I would always be out in the backyard with someone's dog or whatever [LAUGH] so I didn't stink up their house.  But if you keep that to yourself it doesn't really affect --
R:  Bother -- yeah, that's it.  I mean, 'cause I could care -- I mean, most of my -- my ex in laws and that everybody in the- their family smokes and I never had a problem [SIGH] being marr- -- you know, when I was married to him and I have no problem now being divorced and that.  It's just if I don't want to be around it then I feel like I shouldn't have to --
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  -- in that --
L:  I mean, in a closed in space --
R:  Yes, like in a restaurant or anything [NOISE] like --
L:  [MN] I -- that really upsets me 'cause it [SIGH] -- it was hard for me to quit and I feel like I don't want that anywhere near me if I went through that hell to give it up.
R:  Right.  Yes.  A- -- yeah.  I've heard a lo- --
L:  You know?  You can go out on the back porch with the dog and smoke all you want. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, yeah, probably the drinking, it would definitely be the -- the excess.
L:  Yeah.  And when it turns nasty --  I mean, I don't mind silly just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stupid, but you know don't -- I don't know, it seems like for some people it just taps a portion of their brain that's, like, their mean part. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Now -- 
L:  Which is bad.  
R:  Can I ask you -- 
L:  And the gossip -- the gossip too.  I'm all over scuttle butt if it's, you know --
R:  Are y- y- --
L:  -- something juicy but --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- um, sometimes I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if it's true and it's gossip then I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, "Hey, the person being talked about gets what they deserve", but I've also seen it used --
R:  [NOISE] To -- yes.
L:  -- where it's not really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- true and it's just to be hurtful.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  That's true.  I mean, it's definitely in -- in -- they say, you know, [MN] y- y- -- if you gossip too much you know it always come back on you eventually so you're going to get gossip to. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  And then I always think -- my girlfriends we're a -- we're kind of a bad bunch and we'll --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- be out together and I'll be afraid to go to the bathroom --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause it's, like, I know it's my turn to get shoot up if I leave the room. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm not going anywhere.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But then again, after talking about you there're leaving somebody else alone, so 
R:  [NOISE] That's true.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  Now, how -- can I ask you how you heard about this? [MN]
L:  I had a friend that sent --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me an email. 
R:  [NOISE] Ah.
L:  And I probably wouldn't have done it, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um -- you know with the dot EDU in the address it was, like, well, if that's university --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they're doing that study, how interesting.
R:  It is.  I mean, I was, like, oh cool, get paid to gossip or talk to somebody to, you know, just find out different [MN] -- to -- different subjects.  And I know that they're studying to see how people's -- complete strangers, interact an- and that. [NOISE]
L:  I wonder if they'll have it, like, on their website after --
R:  [NOISE] I don't know.
L:  A comparison so the people who -- that participated could see, you know -- because I think they're supposed to be mixing up the regions of the country to see how language is used --
R:  [NOISE] Right.  In -- y- y- you know, 'cause I've had people from, um -- far north.  My, um, mother and father are both from, um, the north.  They were born in Ohio and Illinois and we go up to visit and people will go, "What did you say?".  You know, because they [NOISE] couldn't quite understand what I was saying being from the south because they said I had just a really strong southern accent and I -- I --
L:  Oh, I love that though.  But I always wondered about the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] soda and the pop.
R:  Yea- -- a- -- [LIPSMACK] Yes.  That's a -- you know --
L:  That's the only one I can think of off the top of my head that it's just so regional.  Because I've had people say pop and until I understood what they meant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was like, pop -- pop -- pop -- popcorn.  Wh- -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, a lot of people down here say coke for everything. [NOISE]  
L:  Ooh.
R:  I wanna coke.  And that doesn't necessarily mean Coca Cola.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They want a coke, you know.  And you're, like, "Okay.  Which kind of coke do you want?".  Er -- er -- and we --
L:  Oh, I think my favorite is sweet tea.
R:  Oh, yes.  So, ah, finding people at north they don't put, ah, sweet -- they don't put the sugar in --
L:  Ooh.  And then you get it's like there's something wrong with this.  Because I lived in Florida --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for awhile and I would, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm originally from Maryland and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would drive s- -- up straight through and I'd stop in Georgia and Sou- -- you know, just to get gas and -- and run in and I thought [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's such a big difference.  The south is so much friendlier.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I remember the first time I had sweet tea I thought, "Ooh, this is right up my alley".
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] And I can remember the first time I ordered tea up north and -- and --
L:  And didn't get it. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and all it was, was tea.  Nothing -- and I'm, like --
L:  Ooh!
R:  -- I'm, like, "Where's the sugar?".  You know, "What do you mean where's the sugar".  I was, like, "I asked for a tea".  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  "I asked for ice tea, where's " -- "Well, it is ice tea ..." -- ah- well, down south they put sugar in their tea. [SIGH] 
L:  And then they put those --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pink or the blue packets on the table.  That's not the same as making --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  -- it with the sugar while it's still warm --
R:  Warm and --
L:  -- and it's dissolved.
R:  -- it's melts it and -- yes.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  You get the sugar in the bottom. [NOISE] 
L:  But, this is so cool.  I was scared to death.  I was, like, "Oh, I hope I don't get somebody --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- that doesn't wanna talk". [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] I was thinking that too.  I was, like, "Okay.  This is --"
L:  Oh, dear.  I think we're going --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to have a problem when they say the time's up. [LAUGH]
R:  Is up.  Yes. [LAUGH] And -- yeah.  'Cause I can talk for [NOISE] a -- I -- I stay at home and I have five children so, ah --
L:  Five kids?  Wow!
R:  Yes.  Yes.  I have five and, um, [NOISE] the oldest is eight and my youngest is four months. [NOISE]
L:  Good golly, Miss Molly, you got your work cut out for you.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  And so I don't get a lot of adult conversation. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Conversation.
R:  There's --
L:  Hey, well, you're doing good not talking baby talk to me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I save it for after I get off the phone and go back to play with the kids.  They're all, like, running wild in the house.  They're like, ha ha Mom's on the phone sh- -- we can play. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Can whoop it up.
R:  That's it.  I keep telling them, like, "Yeah.  I'm gonna go send you to live with you Daddy you all keep it up". [LAUGH] [NOISE]  Not that I would really do that.
L:  Oh, I remember -- I remember my mom --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she -- they was just a certain look she would give us --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when she was on the phone that meant, you know, there's gonna be hell to pay when I get off here because some -- sooner or later I'm gonna hang up this phone. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] And I used to love to see which -- there I had the cordless phone so I could walk around the house -- [NOISE] before when we used to have just the a long -- you know, they could just get right out of my reach [NOISE] where I couldn't grab any farther -- 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah!  Back when you were tied up with the phone cord.
R:  [NOISE] Yes. [SIGH] [NOISE] And that -- which it's been a long time since I've had to have a phone cord [NOISE] when, um --
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Five kids, like -- I don't have -- I don't have children but I have a lot of friends --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that do daycare from home.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  And they say the same thing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just like the time the kids go and the husband comes home they're talking in, like, one syllable words 'cause [LAUGH]--
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- all day they've been talking baby talk.
R:  [NOISE] And that's it -- I mean, [NOISE] mine just, ah, you know -- it's -- it's non stop.  I have to -- and most of my friends have children.  Of course, none of my friends have as many children as I do [NOISE].  But, it --
L:  Well, they sound like a happy group.
R:  Yeah.  They're playing --
