L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Oh, hi.  I thought we were going to have a tone before --
R:  I didn't -- I didn't hear any tone.
L:  No, I -- I didn't either, I thought well, maybe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe you're there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi.  Ah, my name is Colleen Avinson.  I live in ah, Salisbury, North Carolina.
R:  I'm Arnold Gwark and I live in a suburb of Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay, that's -- that's neat.  My husband's from ah, the Lancaster area.
R:  Yeah, well I'm from Norfolk originally.
L:  Okay.  How about that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so we're both -- both transplants.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's neat.  Well this seems like a real goofy topic that they gave us.
R:  Yeah, illness.
L:  Illness, gosh.  I'm a pretty healthy person. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I -- I -- I -- I'm healthy now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I'm a very lucky person so far, because, um, I was very sick --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- about um, seven years ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I was diagnosed with Multiple Miloma, which is a cancer of --
L:  I was just going to ask if that was a form of cancer.
R:  -- it's a cancer of the bone marrow.
L:  Oh, my.  Ooh.  
R:  And um, statistically at that time very few people lived more than three years.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's in the Leukemia family.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  And it causes your -- well, it causes your bones to break up, it causes your kidneys to fa- -- it causes -- it just wreaks havoc with your body.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I um, to make a long story short, I decided --
L:  [LAUGH] Well don't make it too short, we have to talk ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  I decided to let a computer choose how I was to be treated because the two options were to either get a bone marrow transplant --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or to get chemo.  And I traveled to the -- to the -- I went to the um, cancer research center at the University of Arkansas --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- where they do, ah, two bone marrow transplants --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- one after another.  And I went to the Dana-Farber Institute, in ah, which is in Boston --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they used a more traditional -- at that time, a more traditional treatment which was similar to what they did at the ah, hospital of the University of Pennsylvania --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I decided to be treated at -- at the hosp- -- at -- at Penn, and um, I didn't know what -- and of course, they do bone marrow transplants --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- they don't do chem -- they don't do one after another like they do in Arkansas.  But anyway, I decided I couldn't -- I didn't -- I -- I decided to -- to be part of a randomized trial --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- where a computer picked a certain number of people to get chemo for a year and certain number of people to get bone marrow transplants, and they're studying the long term results of each group.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So the computer picked me to get chemo --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- which I did --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I've had a complete remission.
L:  For heaven's sake!
R:  So, um --
L:  What an interesting story.
R:  Yeah, I've been very fortunate --
L:  Right, right, I -- I wonder -- I wonder if the -- the, ah, the other treatment folks fared as well.
R:  They claim that the problem with um, with both treatments is there are sub microscopic cancer cells --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when -- when you get a bone marrow transplant, they wipe out your immune system --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and then they -- they put in the new bone marrow.  Well, the problem is, the bone marrow, in my case it would be an autologous transplant which means they take your own bone marrow --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and hopefully clean -- cleanse it of cancer cells --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and then give it back to you.
L:  Yeah, re- -- re-implant it.
R:  Right, as opposed to getting um --
L:  From a donor.
R:  From a donor.  
L:  Right.  I've -- I've had the donor -- I know a little bit about that, I- -- I've --
R:  Right.
L:  -- done the, ah, you know, the donor typing but I've never gotten called.
R:  Well the problem with the donor transplant is that your body can reject it, and it's fatal.
L:  Ooh.
R:  It's called a host versus gr- -- host versus graft disease.
L:  Oh.
R:  So it you get your own, it's not going to reject it, but the problem with getting your own is that there -- they -- they cannot be one hundred percent sure --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that they've wiped out all the cancer cells.
L:  Oh.
R:  So although --
L:  -- you could be getting it back with the --
R:  You might be getting it back.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, anyway --
L:  -- with the cancer.
R:  -- the bottom line is, um, I've been in remission for six years.
L:  Six years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow!  What a blessing.
R:  Yeah, I've been very fortunate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's nothing that I do to -- to -- there's nothing that I can do, other than go see the doctor every six months, who ex- -- who examines my blood profile --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and tells me that all my blood counts are good.
L:  That everything's fine.
R:  Yeah.  So I mean --
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  -- in terms of preventing illness, it -- in that case -- I mean in that sense, regarding that, there- -- there's really nothing that I -- that I do that's special.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So um --
L:  Isn't that -- ha- -- did you have a lot of bad effects from the chemo?  Ho- -- how long did you have that?
R:  I tolerated -- I tolerated it very well.
L:  That's good.
R:  I had some tingling in my ah, fingers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah, oh, in my feet, and I guess -- I think I lost some of the -- when I was getting it, some of the manual dexterity --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- like -- like if I wore a button down collar, I would have trouble buttoning the button.
L:  Buttoning, ah.
R:  But ah, it -- it went away.
L:  So you regained that then, after ?
R:  Yes, when I st- -- when I stopped taking --
L:  -- the chemotherapy --
R:  -- it, yeah.  And I had the chemo -- the way I got the chemo was as an outpatient.  I -- I wore a cassette --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on my belt, and um, that was plugged in.
L:  Wow, now, did you have the nausea and the hair loss?
R:  N- -- we- -- well I did have the hair loss, but I had that when I was started in the hospital, to begin with, I lost my hair.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then um, ah, I'll tell you truth, I don't remember whether it took -- whether I didn't have any hair for a year or not.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just -- I think in the hospital when I -- when I got chemo orig- -- to begin with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think I -- I know I lost it, but I think it grew back when I was getting -- taking the chemo -- getting the chemo, um, I guess I did it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on a weekly basis or a monthly -- whatever it was I -- I think it -- the dosage that I was getting, I don't remember to tell you the truth, it's funny how your mind erases things that --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I -- I guess --
R:  -- that aren't pleasant [LAUGH] --
L:  -- such a traumatic experience, sure.
R:  -- I -- I don't think I went a whole year with -- with no hair.
L:  Right, okay.  Was there any change in the -- the hair -- the hair that grew back?
R:  No.
L:  I'm asking because, um, oh gosh, back in the nineteen seventies, my husband's mother had ovarian cancer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and went through chemo for it and she had the hair loss, and when her hair grew back, her previously fairly straight, I guess it had a little bit of wave to it, hair, grew back just curly.  Just -- just very, very curly and --
R:  That's interesting.  No.
L:  -- they said that sometimes that would ah, ah, that -- that would happen, that it would just change the texture of the hair completely.
R:  It's poss- -- it's possible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I um --
L:  She was not so lucky, though, it -- it ah, came back and she eventually died.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I ah, the way I got the chemo was, I had a catheter that was inserted into my chest and -- and that -- the chemo went into that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and then they -- they removed, when I was finished with the chemo --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they removed that catheter and they put one -- another one in.  It was called a Hickman Loop --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- which hangs outside of your chest --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it goes into your chest, but it hangs and it's got like three [inaudible] on it --
L:  That's got to feel weird.
R:  -- where they can plug in -- plug into it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so when I was finished with the chemo, they removed that, and they implanted a -- it's called a porta-cath, it's under the skin --
L:  I -- I've heard of a porta-cath.
R:  Well I have one.
L:  Okay.
R:  But it's never been used.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I have to get it flushed every six weeks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which I go to the um, um, the chemo department --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and they -- they just put a saline -- they plug in and they put a -- they put a needle in and they inject an saline solution --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which cleans it, and they check it for blood return.  If blood returns, it means it's clear.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So it's fine.  But they don't last forever, and I've had mine now for six years, and I think within the next three or four, it -- it probably won't go more than ten years before it'll have to be removed.
L:  Right, right.  Well, you know, if you go that long with a clean bill of health, then --
R:  Yeah, well that's nothing to -- I mean that -- that should be the worst thing is that I have to take out the porta-cath [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But um, a friend of mine has one, and she got very sick because it got ah, in- i- i- i- -- It had problems --
L:  Clogged.
