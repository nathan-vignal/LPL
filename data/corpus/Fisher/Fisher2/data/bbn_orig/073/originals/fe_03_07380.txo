L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Bethany.
R:  And I'm Maggie.
L:  Oh, hi.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing pretty good.  How're you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.  Um, have you done this before?
L:  Yeah.  I did it for the first yesterday.
R:  Oh.  How exciting.
L:  Have you?
R:  Um, yeah.  I've done it once before.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I talked to some guy.  It was kinda fun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, ha- habits.  Personal habits.
L:  I know.  God. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you remember the whole list?
L:  Not really.  I, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was, like, alcohol --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- overeating --
R:  Excessive use of caffeine, smoking --
L:  [MN] Smoking.
R:  -- gossiping and swearing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wrote them down. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  I was like, I'm not gonna remember this.
R:  Which is -- which is your biggest pet peeve out of the whole list?
L:  Um, I guess -- mm  [LAUGH] I don't know, I can't really decide.  Do you have an opinion?
R:  I -- I think smoking is pretty -- is my -- one of my biggest --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pet peeves.  Like, I used to be a smoker so it's kinda bad of me to, like, down on everybody else but, [SIGH] I just -- so many people don't care that you don't smoke, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, if you sit next to them they just blow it at you and I think that's really disgusting.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my worst peeve for other people.
R:  Yeah.  It -- I don't know, especially if you're, like, sitting in a restaurant and a bar and -- oh!
L:  Yeah.  Actually, I -- I live in Boston and they just passed, um, no smoking anywhere.
R:  Huh!
L:  So it's kinda -- it's good, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think that people -- a lot of people already have, like, stopped smoking practically because that's really the only place they do it anyway.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I was in Boston not that long ago and my friends couldn't smoke in the airport so they were really mad.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I thought it was pretty funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I was out -- I was out to eat yesterday and this -- I just got introduced to my friend -- a friend of my friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he, like, was blowing smoke in my face --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- [NOISE] and I was just, like, I -- I was telling him, like, "I don't smoke, thank you". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't know what else to say. [NOISE] And I was just kinda mad about it, but 
L:  Yeah.  It's like they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't notice they're, like -- or he- heavy smokers -- like they just don't even notice --
R:  Oh, I know.  And it --
L:  -- that they're smoking 'cause they're so, like, addic- --
R:  Either that or they don't care. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  But I think swearing -- I don't really take offence to it because I'm a college kid so, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kind of a second language.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  I don't English, I speak swearing.  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I don't know -- I think -- I -- do you have any other ones from the list that were pretty ?
L:  Um, I guess -- I don't know, I guess the most -- the thing that I hold myself to the most is, like, not overeating and, um, getting enough exercise.  Just 'cause I'm like -- I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that that's, like, probably one of the number one things that people neglect.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  And that, like, leads to other illnesses and people, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dying before their time.  So, I guess that's probably -- like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even if you, you know, quit smoking there's no, like, guarantee that, you know, you're gonna --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not run into problems.  But, um --
R:  Yeah.  You're definitely -- I can agree with that.  I just [NOISE] -- and then I -- I've been watching, like, Dr Phil. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Sounds funny but they had this girl on here -- on there who said she hates fat people and they had, like -- she had all these, like, problems with people who were large because she said it was just laziness and -- which --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- part of it is true, you know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then some people can't help it but  
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  I think people gorge themselves, [NOISE] like, every meal every day.  I think that's pretty gross.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  They do nothing on top of that. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, but you shouldn't hate people, you know, [LAUGH] you shouldn't hate someone just because [SIGH] -- it's silly, but --
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  That's why, you know, I can't really say that I have a pet peeve if someone wants to, you know, like, overeat because if they wanna --
L:  Yeah.  It's their body.
R:  -- like, kill yourself or, you know, be stupid that's your own gig but -- yeah.
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smoking is, like, the only thing out of that list that, like, really affects other people directly.
R:  Well, alcohol -- over alcohol consumption too --
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  -- because that leads to sometimes, you know, drinking and driving and --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- stuff like that and I think that that -- yeah.  I mean, if you've noticed especially -- like I said in college, man, people drink all the --
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  -- time.  That's all they're do, and that can be pretty offensive.  I mean, if you don't know what you're doing -- you don't realize what you're doing you can really offend people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Over caffeine use. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you know anybody who does that?
L:  Not really.  Well, I -- I work at a coffee shop and, like, there's, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- regulars that come in -- they -- they get, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a double shot of espresso.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, every day but it's always like at the same time and they -- you know, I don't see them more than once a day.
R:  That's funny.
L:  But it's kinda like a heavy thing to do every day, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I guess caffeine really doesn't affect me very much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I can drink, you know, coffee or pop or whatever and it really doesn't do that much for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I work with a lady who's absolutely addicted to, like, energy drinks.  
L:  Oh, my God.  Like, Red Bull?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But she's totally, like, church going and you would have no idea that this lady was like that and she --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- totally, like, freaks out and it, like, makes her mood really weird and 
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Yeah.  It's really odd.  Like, if you've ever seen anybody all -- I -- I always say, like -- I always ask her if she's doped up because that's what it looks like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she, like, runs around and she's all jittery and she's --
L:  Like bloodshot --
R:  -- gets mean. [NOISE]
L:  -- eyes.
R:  I know.  I think it's kinda funny.
L:  Yeah.  No, I worked with a lady like that too who drunk Red Bull all the time and she started drinking those, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Starbucks, like, um, frappuccino things, like -- 
R:  Yeah.  Those are good.
L:  -- to, like, cut down or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  But she'd just drunk them, like, the same amount.  It's, ah 
R:  That's horrible.
L:  Yeah.  She, like, works really long hours --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I could kind of understand but she's so obnoxious especially when she, like, didn't have her caffeine.  Like, you know, like have cer- -- whatever, like if she didn't have enough she would, like, always be, like, cranky or something.
R:  But that's just unreal.  You know. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I can't even drink caffeine 'cause it makes -- I'm so sensitive to it.  Like, makes me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, jittery.  It gives me, like, a headache instantly.  It's so weird.  My whole --
R:  Huh.
L:  Like, my dad's side of the family's all like that.  They can't even drink caffeine.
R:  Oh.  I guess that's not too, too bad.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I mean, I can have chocolate and stuff so 
R:  Ah, okay.  That, you know -- that stuff's really not that bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I can't have too much but, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] I always seem to have it.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- yeah, I think that when people start, you know, not realizing what they're doing and they start offending other people with their habits I think that's when it really needs to stop.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you to s- -- you need to do something about it because it's just unacceptable to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's why I think smoking is a big one because -- I mean, how fast and how far does smoke travel?  I mean, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] pretty far.
L:  Yeah.  An- and -- and, like, pets and kids and everything.  I hate it when I hear about people with kids, like, smoking around them. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  'Cause that can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, you know -- that's just as bad.  It's even worse in some cases.
R:  It's even worse if you're pregnant.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like, that is totally a pet peeve of mine, like -- I'm -- I'm a waitress and so, like, people will come in to, you know, the restaurant and they'll have, like, three little kids with them, like, two years olds and baby babies and I'm --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like, "Why are you sitting in a smoking section?" and I just wanna look at them and slap them in the face and say, "What are you doing to your children?"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  "Can you please just not do that?" [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  And then they wonder why their kids have, like, [MN] all these disorders and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I just don't get it.  I totally don't get it.
L:  And it's not like it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like people that are, like -- have coke babies or whatever.  You know, it's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, that's bad but it's, like, it's not like smoking isn't just as bad really because that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can kill you just as much, you know.  It's, like, just as addictive or more and it's, like, in the long term, you know, you've -- I mean, you know, cocaine babies -- like, I -- I used to have a friend that, um, her parents adopted them and like, you know, like they eventually get it out of their system -- they have problems or anything but it doesn't, like, kill them. 
R:  Right.
L:  But I mean if you have, like, a parent that's been smoking their whole -- your whole life, like, you'll probably have some kind of health disorder.
R:  Yeah.  I [MN] -- well, and if your -- if you -- your parents -- like, if you mom smokes when you're pregnant, like, that's my major in college --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is how development -- it is so bad.
L:  I know.
R:  The carcinogens are just, like -- it's unreal.
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, man.  An- and so -- so many woman I've seen lately have said, "Oh.  It only causes low birth weight".  And I'm like, "Isn't that bad enough?".
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  You know?
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Hav- have you ever seen that ad on MTV?  It says, "What baby do you prefer?"
L:  I don't think I've seen that actually.
R:  It's like for no smoking and it's got like, this girl and she's -- and then this guy, I think it maybe -- like, she shows pictures of babies to, ah -- to, like, random people on the streets of New York and baby A. is like healthy weight baby --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and baby B. is, like, a little tiny baby, [LAUGH] like, a preemie --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- that's low birth weight.  And almost everyone said that they'd rather have baby A.  You know, the healthy baby?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so they are tacking it up on the thing and it's, like, the major tobacco industries have said that, you know, "It doesn't -- smoking will cause absolutely no problems to your unborn child" and America tends to disagree.  Who wants to have a, you know, a premature, low birth weight baby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There was, like, two out of five hundred --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or something that they asked.  
L:  My God.
R:  It was kinda funny.  But -- yeah.  Um, what were some of the other ones?
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I don't know.  Like, ah, I thought they were gonna ask us about, like -- well, I guess it is sort of about our personal habits but, like, I -- I don't know, like I kinda disapprove of all of them, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not -- I mean, smoking obviously is the worst but, um, I don't know.  It's just like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everyone does everything to excess.
