R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, about the illness right? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um, it is true.  If you don't go to the doctor an- -- um, [NOISE] if you get really sick -- even if you're just a little bit sick and, you know, you have a cold and you know you can't fight you need to go to the doctor and get it checked out. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Because it can get worse --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the person could die from it. [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  Especially if someone is older.  I think -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- elderly, um, I --
L:  [NOISE] And babies too.
R:  Oh, babies too.  That is true.  I forgot --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- about that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and stuff.  Ah, yeah, I do get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cold sometimes when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a season does change, um -- [LIPSMACK] although I live --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Southern California so that it's --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- not an extreme change. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what part --
L:  [NOISE] Like in --
R:  -- of the country are you from?
L:  Hello?
R:  Wha- -- hello?  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah, I do.  What did you say?
R:  What part of the country are you from?
L:  Oh, I'm from Brooklyn, New York and right now we're going through a lot of, like, rain and [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- one minute it's raining and it's cool, next minute it's hot so, it's, like --
R:  Oh, boy!
L:  -- back and forth weather.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But -- 
R:  Yeah.  When they -- when here it's -- well, here it's -- it's just got, ah, um -- it's actually warm today but most of the time in June it's -- it's, ah, drizzly and foggy and --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- gloomy for the month type of thing.  But, ah, yeah, when the seasons kinda change, although we don't have snow, yes I got [LAUGH] -- I get a- -- like, allergies and stuff.
L:  Oh, okay.  You suffer from it.
R:  Yeah, like [MN] --
L:  I don't suffer from allergies --
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  I don't.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But being [inaudible] 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH] You're lucky.
L:  -- with my [inaudible] [LAUGH] I have two kids, like, a two and three year old and --
R:  Ooh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- with th- the worse thing is, like, you know, to get undressed in the morning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you put a jacket on and most of the time through the day it's, like, nice and warm -- it's hot.  So, you take the jacket off and then towards the end it's getting to be cold and all of a sudden they start sneezing. 
R:  Ahah.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Kids get, ah, get stuff all the time.  I have a five year old and a fifteen year old so [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
R:  Ah, I got a big, ah, a big spread, but she has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- allergies too here and there, um 
L:  Oh man! [NOISE]
R:  Which, ah -- oh, you know, you deal with it.  Colds, you, um -- sometimes we go the doctor, sometimes we don't.  It really depends.
L:  [NOISE] I know. [NOISE]
R:  Aller- allergies, no.  I went initially and got tested so I have medicine for that, um --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] Well, what -- [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] But I try not to take it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Well, you have to, like, [inaudible] you know, with -- especially with little kids, you have to take them to the doctor constantly, I mean --
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Because that one little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sniffling and sneezing little thing turns into a -- a fever, you know.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  It's just like -- I've been through it with, you know, with my babies.  Like, one minute they -- they sick, next minute it's, like, they're really sick.  I'm like, "Oh God, what's going on?" you know?
R:  Mhm.  Ahah.  Do they get --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ear infections much or ?
L:  Um, before they was getting ear infections but I try to -- I give them multi vitamins, um --
R:  Ahah. [NOISE]
L:  You know, keep 'em --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- warm.  You just, you know, keep a hat on their head and all that, you know, keep a jacket on them even if it's -- it's a little bit warm, I keep the jacket on, you know, just in case.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Until the summer hits.  Then they can have -- you know, they can wear their short sleeved shirts.  So, right now they cannot wear any short sleeved shirts at all.
R:  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm thinking -- I say I'm thinking New York is warm except in the winter it's cold. [LAUGH]
L:  Ooh.  It's -- it's funny.  This year it has been, [MN] like, weird.  You know, one minute, um, you know, this month, last month -- one minute it's, like, hot.  It'll just be really hot and then all of a sudden the next day it'll just drop. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's -- then you've got to wear a coat, you know, you want to have your hat on because it's too cold.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, right -- yeah.  Where are you from? [NOISE]
R:  It's -- it's Southern California.
L:  O- o- okay. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] So, it's more -- it's usually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's warmer here. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, man.
R:  But, ah, but for us, you know, um, ah, you know, it's all relative.  I'm sure if you came out here you'd be wearing shorts because it would be so warm for you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  But, for us it's really, I mean, it was -- it's -- actually it was warm today.  It was probably seventy five today.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  But it's been in the sixties actually, which for me is a little cool. [SIGH].  So, we don't wear hats over here. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, man. [NOISE]
R:  Except to take -- ah, except to get away from the sun.
L:  [NOISE] That's true. That's -- [NOISE]
R:  For sun.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But, you know, I remember last year, ah, it was really cold and we were, like, covering up in, you know, sick, and I seen this guy who walked right into a g- -- um, actually a McDonalds --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with shorts on, a T. shirt on --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Outside dead winter.  And I --
R:  [SIGH] That's -- yeah.
L:  -- was looking at him and wondering, "Is he wanted to get pneumonia?". [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.  But, that's nuts.  That is -- that is really, really nuts.  Those people should really [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.  But he said -- he said to the lady, "Oh, I love the cold.  I love the cold.  I never get sick".  I said, "Okay, fine". [LAUGH] Anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  People who do that are crazy.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I gotta -- I gotta say that, ah, for sure.  But, ah, yeah in generally you've got to stay protected an- and, um, eat as best -- you know, eat as healthily as you can an- and take care of yourself so you don't get sick basically.
L:  Yeah, that's true. That is true.
R:  But, I'm sure it's hard for you with, ah -- running around with two kids. [LAUGH]  Two little ones.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  It's -- yeah, it's probably -- it's really -- when they get sick or- -- just everything goes -- gets bad and especially when they go to daycare --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you've got to be really careful about them getting sick because if they is too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sick they would not take them.
R:  [SIGH] Right.  Right.
L:  And that's even with a person to take care of them.  I gotta make sure, you know, that I stay on top of her, you know, that she is, um, feeding them the right things, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because with the food, if you're not feeding your kids proper nutrition it- -- you know, a proper diet, they'd get sick from that.  
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  They'd get their immune system, um, well, um -- I'm sorry.  Their immune system [NOISE] could go down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that would cause colds. [NOISE]
R:  That is -- that is, ah -- I a- -- I agree that's -- that's true.  Yeah, my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- daughter's in -- in daycare part time and pre school part time.  But, um --
L:  [NOISE] Ooh.
R:  -- ah, the daycare -- there's only a couple of kids, so she's ha- -- she's had real -- I've had real good luck over there. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, she's older now so she's only had like two ear infections.  You know, my son --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when she was small, [LIPSMACK] he went into d- -- ah, daycare when he was younger than she was and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he used to get ear infections all the time.  Ooh [LAUGH] ha --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  That's like the bir- [NOISE] --
R:  I remember those days. [LAUGH] I --
L:  Yeah.  Bec- --
R:  Y- yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Because I remember, um -- I did not realize for a long time my son was getting really sick and to find out, when I tested his blood, he had low blood, um -- low iron.
R:  Ooh. [NOISE]
L:  And, because of the iron --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know -- I never knew that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- iron was really good, you know, like, you're supposed to get enough of it so you won't get sick.  [SIGH] But, he has so much, ah- -- his iron was so low, he was consistently getting sick all the time. [NOISE] You know?
R:  Oh Go- -- ye- yeah.  You wouldn't even think of that as being a symptom of anything.
L:  Yeah.  Bec- --
R:  I mean, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't have known that at all.
L:  I wouldn't.  You know, that's like when have kids you learn -- everyday you learn something new.  You know, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- right now, um, they take these vitamins twice a day, you know, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- chewable vitamins.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I give 'em to them everyday and so far, thank God, you know, th- they might sneeze it'll go away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, not a bad cold like ho- how it was, like, almost two years ago.  It was, like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- really bad. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, boy.  Yeah -- 
L:  [NOISE] You know. 
R:  -- the vitamins will make a difference then.
L:  Yeah. Because, like, now I give it to 'em like a ritual.  You know, before it was, like, I -- I would forget for a week. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Ahah.
L:  You know, I'd just constantly forget but now I know that if I don't give it to them at -- if I don't, you know, feed them right they will get sick and then -- I end up having to stay home -- Dan[?] will have to -- you know, just everything, ach  [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, I know.  An- and right --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- if you -- if -- if -- if you work and stuff an- and they get sick, you're right and they don't take them ...  Yeah, you gotta take off work.  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I've done it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And how many days a week?  Yeah, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've done -- I- I've done it, hm, I've done it many times and you're busy at work and you've just gotta tell your boss, "Sorry" and they kinda can't complain --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, that's just how it is sometimes, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  You gotta do what you gotta do.  That's how it is.  But, ah, yeah -- I never thought of doing it twice a day actually.  Is regular, um, ah, [NOISE] a brand name, ah, chewable or are they prescription chewable vitamins?
L:  Well, actually it's from a company I deal with, um, Melaleuca.  It's called --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- VitaBears.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] it has, um, fructose.  It has something else with this, um, -- flavonoids in it and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's the same --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] flavonoids is in grapes, um -- concord grapes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, concord grapes are good for your body.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  [NOISE] And, so, it -- it -- it absorbs all the nutrients in your system so, it's much better, and, um, you take it twice a day for their age.  Those vitamins are used -- it's, like, for kids under, I think, six years old --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- or something like that, um, under a certain age.  And, then after -- over s- -- over six then you have to give 'em, like, four times a day.
R:  Ooh. [LIPSMACK]
L:  You know, it's -- it's -- but, it's -- it's chewable, it's cherry flavor.  Every single morning my son is like, "Can I have a vitaminute[?]". [LAUGH]
R:  How cute.
L:  But he means vitamins. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Right.
L:  And he, you know, he looks forward to his vitamins, [LIPSMACK] you know.  He even --
R:  Well, that's a good [inaudible]--
L:  -- tell me, "My vitamins". [NOISE] You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh.  That's -- that's good.  No, that's --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- good 'cause then they'll remember.  My daughter does remind me 'cause I will occasionally.
L:  Yeah.  Ooh. Yeah --
R:  [SIGH] Um, I'll remember it --
L:  That's -- I sometimes forget. [LAUGH]
R:  Ha ha.  I know, I have to remi- remind myself to take my vitamins every day. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I have to buy -- you know, I wish they had some good vitamins for adults that are chewable. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, swallow these horse [NOISE] pills. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know.  We don't have fun tasting ones --
L:  No. [NOISE]
R:  -- compared with -- I think one time I'd ran out of vitamins and didn't get a chance to go to the store so I think I have two of her chewables.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  I thought, "That'll do for today" 'cause I looked at the back and -- actually it does say kids and adults [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.
R:  -- on there.  [NOISE] It does so, if -- if you know, you're in a pinch [LAUGH] have their vitamins.
L:  Ha. [LAUGH]
R:  And, that's what -- that's what I did and, um 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I took two instead of one -- 
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and stuff, so, that, ah, that di- -- that did for the day.  'Cause -- 'cause I usually go to a -- a warehouse club and -- and ah, well --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's, ah, Sam's Club actually over here and --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  Like Bee jay's?  Um, or Costco? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I've heard of Bee jays.  It's -- yes --
L:  Ah, that's a --
R:  Pretty similar.  We have Costco out here and, um, Sam's Club.
L:  Okay.  'Cause I thought --
R:  Yeah, we don't -- we don't have Bee jay's, no.
L:  Yeah, I had -- well, Bee jay's is much better because they have all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the main brands and stuff in there and, plus, they take coupons. [LAUGH]
R:  I've heard that.  Yeah, those don't take coupons down there.  Yeah, I
