L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Um, I'm Manu.
L:  Uh, my name is Wanda.
R:  Oh, hi.  [LAUGH]  Um, yeah, so, um ...
L:  Okay.  The topic of the day is -- is bad habits.  [LAUGH]
R:  Bad habits.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Which do we think is worse, uh, smoking or gossiping?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, well, I'm smoking a cigarette right now.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Um, okay, um, I -- I don't know.  I guess gossiping.
L:  Yeah.  Well, gossiping is -- is -- is a bad habit, um ...
R:  It's a bad habit.  Okay.  I agree it's a bad habit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But to me having sex a lot that's a bad habit.
R:  That's -- that's a pretty bad habit.
L:  Yeah, because you're having sex and then you don't know, you know, if the other person that you're having sex with [NOISE] is, um, having safe sex.
R:  Yes.  That's true.
L:  So, it's like you have to, um -- you know, have to realize [NOISE] and see if, um -- you ask like thirty million questions, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who?  What?  When?  Where?  How many times?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you use protection?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It's better than, you know, whatever, um ...
R:  It's -- yeah.  Um, it's ...
L:  That's like the worst thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It is definitely -- yeah.  But, I mean, it's -- it's funny how like -- it's funny like what's -- like even like smoking is, um -- smoking for instance is like a --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's considered like a bad habit, like even -- even worse than like other things.  I mean ...
L:  Yeah.  Right.  I agree with you for the simple fact of like second hand smoke that's like [NOISE], you know, the worst effect of smoking and, um --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
L:  -- and, you know -- and -- and you smoke -- when you smoke -- when you're actually smoking you're hurting yourself, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah, I agree with you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I guess in the sense of like you gotta balance it out which one is the worst --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like really, really the worst.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- 'cause I don't smoke, you see, I don't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I -- you know?
R:  Yeah.  Um, let's see.  Um, I guess -- I guess in all these things like it's important to have, um, some element of self control and stuff.  That's, uh -- I guess, you know, which is somewhere between all these different like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like topics, these things, um, I guess that's what makes it seem like really a bad habit at all -- like at all because like you can't control it, you know, and it's not you know -- I mean, if you just decide to do it, you know, like -- I don't know -- like eat for no reason --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all the time, you know, that's -- that's one thing else, you know, or there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if you don't -- if you want to -- if you can't control yourself from eating that's -- that's more of a habit as opposed to -- and so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the control -- the control aspect is just kinda important.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it -- it is.  You're right.  And it's kinda hard because there's a lotta people that I know that smoke cigarettes --
R:  Mhm.  [COUGH]
L:  -- and they've smoked cigarettes like forever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, you know, they'll get up in the morning and the first thing they do is have a cigarette.
R:  Yeah, that's kinda gross.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  You know, like right after you get up and you have a cigarette that's like ...
R:  Yeah.  That's just really gross.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And then they'll eat and right after they eat they just have to have a cigarette.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm like, you know, what part of the day don't you smoke because --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  -- every time you see them ...
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Yeah.  Every time you see them, you know, they'll have a cigarette in their mouth --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know -- and to me, um, you know, cigarette smoke -- being that my step father smoked for eighteen years [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, it was -- cigarette smoke is hard to like get outta your clothes, your bed, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Stuff like that, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and I've seen people were their habit must really, really be bad to the point where their nails are like yellow.
R:  Y- oh, yeah.  I mean, it's -- it's -- it honestly is terrible for like -- and especially for long term and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and when you -- yeah -- and it's just -- it's just awful.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's like, you know -- I mean, in -- like I said, I know people that smoke and -- and it just depends on how much you smoke I guess, or how much you -- you need to ...
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it's -- it's all a matter -- it's all I think a matter of like if you smoke like, you know, how -- what -- are you in control of it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or is it in control of you?
L:  Because there's people that -- I -- I know that they've -- they've quit, okay, after some time, sure --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, for whatever reason --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- personal or health and then there's people -- like young people, "No, I can't quit and that's like my bad habit.  I know it's gonna kill me, but I just can't.  I just can't".  And they'll -- you know, I mean, cigarettes are -- at the end of the month, you know, that it's also like your rent money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I mean, that's the thing like if it -- if it, you know -- like, if it keeps you from doing normal things, you know, if it keeps you from --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, being able to, um, you know, live, you know, pay for fundamental things like food and, you know, rent and ...
L:  I mean, definitely, you know -- I mean, I -- there's -- I mean, cigarettes is like, you know, I just have to have a cigarette, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Here's a quarter, can I get a -- you know, do you have a cigarette?  'Cause even people in the street they're -- they'll come up to you even if you don't smoke --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- they just ask you, you know?
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  "Do you have a cigarette?  Can -- can I have a cigarette?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's like -- that's like a totally -- I -- I never knew 'cause like I said I don't smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I never knew what was the fascination with cigarettes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's like ...
R:  I mean, what's -- what's really interesting is like it var- -- at first it's just not -- it's not even entertaining.  Like the reason people do it is to be cool and stuff, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when -- you can -- I can see like, um -- I mean, the same way you smoke like a cigar or something like that, you know, there are aspects about it that are, you know, enjoyable like smoking -- sometimes, you know, like smoking a cigar or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and having a drink or, you know -- or, you know, after -- after, you know, a nice dinner or something like that if you have a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- feel the complements and stuff that's nice and stuff, but I -- you know, you're just taking it too far.  Like, even the cigars there are people that can't stop smoking them, you know, and that's -- that's even worse like ...
L:  Definitely.  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause they -- they don't have no filters.
R:  Oh, God, yeah.
L:  So, I'm like -- I'm like how -- I mean, I don't know.  I don't -- like with -- cigarettes it doesn't gross me out, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like cigars I'm like how can they even smoke that?
R:  Exactly.  Like ...
L:  That's -- it's just like it stinks.
R:  I mean, I -- I like -- I like a cigar every once in a while, but like it's just -- like for -- to smoke like some people do like all the time it's just disgusting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I don't -- I don't -- like I said, it -- well, you know, cigarettes are like --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- to me I think that's anybody's death wish.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it's like, you know, if you smoke a little bit you still end up sick.  If you smoke a lot you still end up sick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're not gonna be -- you know, you're not gonna be capable to do every day activities --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like exercise --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause at -- at -- at one point of the exercise you're gonna be fatigued.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know, you'll be outta breath [NOISE] and whatever the case may be.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean ...
L:  And then ...
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I think that like it's -- you know, it's -- and it's also -- it's an issue of like respecting yourself, you know, like you're not, you know, taking care of yourself and you're doing -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you're overeating, when you're not exercising, when you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and ...
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I have -- I have friends that do smoke and they'll substitute with like eating -- eating a salad [LAUGH], but then turn around and -- and smoke two cigarettes.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:   So, I'm like if -- you know, cigarettes is not something where it's going into your veins, it's going into your lungs.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, the young -- these days young people are very -- like even though they know the dangers and stuff they just don't care.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, I don't -- they have such -- like a ...
L:  Yeah, they're very naive.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  So, like, you know -- they're like well, you know, if I do this then, you know, cigarette smoke is not gonna do anything --
R:  Yeah.  They -- they ...
L:  -- and, you know -- and some people might smoke cigarettes --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- for like twenty something years and, you know, they'll be okay, but not everybody has that, you know, luck or whatever it is, you know, anybody wants to call it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause not everybody's fortunate like that, but ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And the person -- I mean, in a way the person who eventually will -- a billionaire, but then in a way like --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- he or she should never have invented it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, 'cause it's like not only filling your lungs, my lungs and everybody else's lungs --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, you're -- it's -- it's like a fortune just to have cigarettes.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  You're polluting the air.  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think that's probably like the -- the most like in your face factor about it, like it just costs so much and --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- people can't -- and people who can't afford it just still can't, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, still --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- still can't stop.
L:  Yeah.  A pack is like -- I mean, here in -- in my area a pack is like almost eight bucks.
R:  Where -- where are you?
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm in -- I'm in Baltimore.  Like, I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I go to New York like every once and a while and it's like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's so expensive --
L:  Definitely. 
R:  -- and to see people like, you know -- it's -- it's just amazing.
L:  Yeah, 'cause -- and -- and, you know, it's like sometimes in the street you can catch 'em --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, trying to sell 'em a little cheaper.  But, you know, you've gotta be careful.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But it's like it -- it goes to show you how much of a bad habit that it is, you know, how -- how much people just saying --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- "I gotta have a cigarette", you know, and people often get in bad moods 'cause trust me I've got plenty of smokers in my family and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- they just all make me sick.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I think like -- oh, I mean, half the reason like -- I mean, I, you know, really got into smoking like and it was that, you know, during school and stuff it's just so stressful and stuff like that and you just feel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know -- and you just need a break and -- and honestly at the time you feel so -- you know, you don't even care about what you're doing to your body anyway 'cause you just, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  -- and ...
L:  I mean, that's -- I've heard a lotta people say that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they'll even -- you know, they'll say, "Oh, I started smoking when I was fourteen 'cause my life was just stressing me out" or school stressed me out --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- or work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my wife or, you know -- wife, work or my husband --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever the case may be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know ...
R:  I mean, every once in a while I try to stop smoking for like a while, you know, like give it like -- you know, a couple of weeks, like a week or something, two weeks, you know, before I have another cigarette or something, and it's -- and it's just not -- you know, like my Dad was smoking for -- his --
