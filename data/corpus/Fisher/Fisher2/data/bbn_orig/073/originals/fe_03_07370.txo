R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi. [SIGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Pam.  From --
R:  I'm Tru- --
L:  -- Washington.
R:  I'm Trudy Orseo[?] from Washington.
L:  Oh, you're from Washington also? 
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  Are you from western or eastern Washington?
R:  I'm from, um, ah, western Washington.
L:  I'm from outside --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of Renton so  Okay.
R:  Oh!  Okay. [NOISE] I'm [MN] -- I'm south of you.
L:  Oh.  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  This is a tough subject to talk about.  I don't 
R:  I'm not even sure what this is about. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Have you done any --
R:  To tell you the truth, we've -- we've been taking -- we've been taking these calls and we haven't answered them because we didn't know what they were.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, I think, vaguely th- -- I had -- I signed up for something on the internet about this.  So the test subject is about illness?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you get ill, w- um, when the, um, e- seasons change?
L:  Ah, not really.  I haven't been sick for a long time now.  Knock --
R:  So you don't have any allergies and you don't have [inaudible]?
L:  Knock on wood.  Oh, I do get allergies in -- in May.
R:  Okay.  Well, that counts. [NOISE] 
L:  For the first week of May.  That -- I guess -- that's count- -- that counts. [SIGH]
R:  [MN] How does -- how does your, um, illness, ah, affect your -- your, um -- how does it affect you to make you ill?  It obviously didn't -- [NOISE]
L:  Oh, gosh.  It almost puts me down --
R:  [NOISE] It does? [NOISE]
L:  -- I get -- I get headaches and, um, my eyes water --
R:  Really?  
L:  -- really bad.
R:  It's interesting that you didn't realize [NOISE] that you were sick, when --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it does get you sick.  It's just that wi- [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.  It's mostly --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think it's when, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the elder comes into bloom th- the first week of, ah --
R:  Oh.  Is it --
L:  -- May.  And then --
R:  Really?
L:  -- cotton wood comes in after that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I'm just really allergic to that. [SIGH]
R:  Yes.  I was very ill, um, this last May.
L:  Oh.  Is it-
R:  I -- I couldn't talk for almost -- I mean, I couldn't sing at church [NOISE] or talk or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anything hardly.
L:  Do you think it was allergies then?
R:  I think it was allergies and now I have asthma.
L:  Ooh.
R:  So, it -- it went into asthma or it +exasperated -- you know, it make it worse this ye- -- this year.  But, ah, you don't have SADs then? Do you --
L:  What's that?
R:  -- know what SADs is?
L:  Oh.
R:  SADs a seasonal, um, ah, depression.
L:  Ooh.
R:  I can't remember it's -- it's S.A.D.  It stands for Seasonal, um, [SIGH] Affected Disorder or something like that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Where you get de- depressed when the, um -- and a lot of people do get, um, SADs bec- -- when the weather changes and when the seasons change in the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Pacific Northwest because, ah -- not only because we get less of the sun --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and those, you know, vitamin D a- -- rays -- of ultraviolet rays but [SIGH] also because it rains so much. [NOISE] But 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and it's always cloudy. [LAUGH]
R:  Is it -- oka- -- it doesn't affect you though huh?
L:  [SIGH] No, just that first week and a half, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just -- I get really, you know -- and it didn't affect me when I was young it's just when I'm older that it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- been coming on and --
R:  Oh, interesting?
L:  -- some years it's worse than others and stuff.
R:  How old are you? [NOISE]
L:  I'm almost fifty.
R:  Your -- I'm almost fifty as well. [NOISE] So --
L:  So, um --
R:  Are you on menopause?
L:  Not yet.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Not yet.
R:  I was just wondering if that -- I'm -- I'm not -- I'm kind of pre- pre men- -- men- menopausal, so 
L:  Well, I did have some symptoms -- quite a few symptoms --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in -- in fact in the last few years for pre menopause, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I haven't had any lately --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- and I don't know if it's because, um, I've been out of work for a long time now and I --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- used to get the symptoms --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot when I was working.
R:  Oh.  
L:  You know.  I think --
R:  Stress?
L:  -- because of stress.  I was stressed out and it brings them on.  But, now I don't even --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get the hot flashes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at night any more and -- or anything --
R:  Isn't that something?
L:  -- so it's just -- it's really changed and I've been w- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out of work for a long time.  I used to work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all the time.  
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  But now since I've been out of work for, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about eight months now that, you know, my body's really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- changed because I used to work every single day. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I see.  I work part time because I have fibromyalgia.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that affects -- when the weather changes and, ah, seasons change, that affects my health as well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from -- with the fibromyalgia.  Um, when it gets cold, um, I hurt a lot.  I can't handle a lot of the coldness.  We don't get really that cold here.  
L:  No.
R:  But when the weather changes [MN] was -- it -- I'm sorry.  Was the s- -- was the subject weather or season?
L:  I think it's season.
R:  Well, seasons tend to --
L:  We don't have any real --
R:  -- have different types of weather.  But not so much here but in th- --
L:  Here.  Yeah.  We don't really have any really different changes of seasons, it just --
R:  Although we did --
L:  -- goes from cold rain to warm rain. [LAUGH]
R:  Rig- -- Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] Well, it does -- how long have you lived in the Pacific Northwest?
L:  All my life.
R:  I have too.  I have noticed that --
L:  And, I have not -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I notice the last couple of years we haven't had the rains --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like we used to.
R:  Not in January as much.  We've had --
L:  No.
R:  -- very strange weather it seems.
L:  And we used to have very wet Junes and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Mays and, um 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not this year though.  It just doesn't seem to --
R:  But it -- it would especially rain -- we'd have the real, real horrible rain that would seem to last for ever in February.
L:  Yeah.  Last for about four days past July fourth. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  'Cause I can- -- ah, I think every July fourth but one or two has been bad. [LAUGH]
R:  I notice. [NOISE]
L:  So, um, I don't know.
R:  I not- -- but, on my birthday it's usually [NOISE] very nice out. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's March sixteenth.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although last year it snowed and I cried because I never -- I didn't realize that I was born in the winter.  I always thought I was born in the summer -- I mean, spring because it's always been so nice on my birthday.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But usually around my birthday because the weather changes [NOISE] and because the season changes -- is beginning to change bu- -- and we're out of the rain so much, um, I usually get happier. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's -- and I'm able to do more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, when I see the, um -- right now when I see the seasons changing and, ah, when our Indian summer usually ends in October, I can -- I can myself almost be, um, starting to, you know [SIGH], just kind of slow down and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [NOISE] not be able to do so much when the -- when the days get long -- ah, shorter.  
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  So, but that doesn't affect you, huh?
L:  No.  And I -- I brought a place --
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  -- out in the desert in Oregon and I'm going to retire at.  I'm gonna just --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- move out of here.  And, um --
R:  In -- in Arizona?
L:  No.  Oregon.  Eastern Oregon.
R:  Oregon?  Oh, eastern Oregon
L:  And, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's a big weather change for me.  Um --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  It's gonna be pretty drastic because I've lived here all my life, but --
R:  Yeah.  That would be.
L:  -- I just -- I just want some kind of change in my life, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I just -- I don't -- I get kind of a little bit arthritic when it's raining and, um --
R:  Uh-huh.  I do too.
L:  -- in dampness.  'Cause I -- 'cause I work outside when I'm working and it's just -- it gets into my joints and I just --
R:  You don't find arth- -- that, um, your arthritis is worse in the winter than it is in the summer?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Right. [NOISE] Because of the --
L:  Because of the cold rain it's just --
R:  Even -- even though it's a little bit, [NOISE] um, you know, we -- we don't have real, um, drastic -- I can't imagine living in, um, [NOISE] -- excuse me.  "No, honey".  That's where you're gonna have a hard time because in the -- in the eastern Washington, and I believe in eastern Oregon too, you're going to feel the weather changes str- stronger. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Rather than if you lived in a place like, um -- someone was telling me -- a Professor was telling to -- if I really wanted to not be in pain [LAUGH] all the time to go to Arizona because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they had, um -- high elevation was really good for pain --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they actually have cities in high elevation [NOISE] -- "Honey, they're [inaudible]".
L:  Yeah, like, Flagstaff is really high.
R:  Yeah.  He -- that's where he was, um, saying Flagstaff.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And that there are actually bigger cities there and whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that's why a lot of, ah, [NOISE] I -- I -- I don't know if that's where all the, um, people are retiring but I guess the people [NOISE] -- 
L:  But I've had quite a few people who have move there.
R:  Really?  Because of arthritis? [NOISE]
L:  They're in their fifties and sixties.  Yeah.  They're just --
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  -- tired of being in this kind of climate.  They're tired of the traffic, you know.  Things like that, so --
R:  The traffic's getting really bad. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But, um -- I -- I had considered -- y- you know, I've lived here all my life too and all my family and my extended family and -- and everyone --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- is -- is right here. [SIGH] But as the traffic gets worse and [SIGH] as we are turning into California, and because I am hurting a lot, and because of the sinuses too  [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it sounds like you have [NOISE] allergies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess, um, those problems are worse in this area too. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  But they said in Arizona the allergies are starting to get bad 'cause people are bringing their plants with them. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh.  Really?
L:  From the other locations in the country, yeah.
R:  Well, as long as we don't bring things like scotch broom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which was a, um, transplant from Scotland. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And it's very invasive now and it's [NOISE] considered --
R:  And it's -- and the- they use it to cover the fir- freeways around here.
L:  Yes, uh-huh.  
R:  You know, so 
L:  That -- that was a mistake because --
R:  Everywhere, you know so it -- 
L:  -- everybody is allergic to it.
R:  -- you know, it -- [MN] r- right when it's blooming you hea- -- see everyone's noses expand, you know.  So  [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Are you taking any medication for your, um, arthritis?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, no.  I've just -- I just take a little bit of a- -- um, aspirin or Tylanol or leaves, sometimes.
R:  What kind do you have?  Osteo?
L:  No.  I just have, um -- it's not rheu- -- -- it's not, um, rheumatoid arthritis.  Yet, but I don't --
R:  Mhm.  Is it osteoarthritis or is it ?
L:  Yeah.  It's osteoarthritis and my mother has got rheumatoid arthritis and I know --
R:  So does mine.
L:  I -- I think it's heredity too from what I've heard.  But I'm afraid --
R:  Yeah.  My mother and I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my sister has rheumatoid arthritis and -- and -- and both of us, my sister and I have, um, osteoarthritis as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I have the fibromyalgia and whatev- whatever other stuff.
L:  I had a -- I had a tool partner who had fibromyalgia and stuff.  She's --
R:  Really?  A tool part- -- what did you do when you work- --
L: -- having problems.  She's going through a lot of different physical therapies and trying thi- -- different things and that helps.
R:  Well, I -- I have read -- basically what I do is that I don't think about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because when I talk about other people and I -- I was told you can't -- from the doctor you can't be disabled from it.  Well, yeah.  I've seen a lot of people be disabled from fibromyalgia. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it can be so, um, it can be very devastating and I'm going, [SIGH] "I was told you couldn't be disabled" and I'm actually doing better.  But a lot of the reason why I'm doing better I really think is because I don't have teenagers anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And str- -- [LAUGH] because stress really, um, really, um, affects it.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Do you think that the traffic an- and the stress level, um, during the seasons is worse?  Like, for instance, in the fall when the kids are going to school and everything.  Do you think ?
