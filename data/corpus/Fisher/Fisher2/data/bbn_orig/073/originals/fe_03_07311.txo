L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Nancy.
L:  I'm Camille.
R:  Hi Camille.
L:  Hi.
R:  I kinda missed that first bit 'cause I was changing phones, it says, it said descri- ah, what you prefer eating in a restaurant and at home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and prefer -- or -- or --
L:  I think it was describe your perfect food.
R:  You perfect food, well that would be pizza [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I -- I like so many different kinds of foods it's hard to choose.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I definitely prefer eating in restaurants though.
R:  Do you?
L: Yeah, I think so, but I'm not a very good cook so --
R:  I'm not, I just never have the time to go to a restaurant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I don't know, there's just always so much going on, it's so expensive, not, or you know, just -- she's not so expensive, but it's just that much cheaper to eat at home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, I do like going out occasionally, I have to say that, but generally we do stay at home, but um -- I don't know, I -- and I -- I kind of more like a -- I don't -- I -- I don't mi- mind, I shouldn't say I don't mind but um, I -- I kind of, I guess I would say I -- I -- I would prefer if I'm going out to a restaurant to go to something like a Mexican or a pizza or a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, you know some place like that as opposed to perhaps you know every week going out to like a very upscale restaurant --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I definitely don't want to go out to a really something fancy all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I kinda like, I like ethnic cuisines of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- various sorts, I really like Indian food, and ah, sushi and Chinese food and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, um, yeah I like Chinese food, um, haven't ever tried Thai, but I understand it's very --
L:  It's really good. 
R:  -- very spicy and diff- and different .
L:  It's really good, I -- I think -- I mean, if you like Chinese food you can probably find something at a Thai restaurant you would like --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I would say, and they have really good noodle dishes.
R:  Do they?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're big on noodles as well?
L:  Yeah, I -- I like noodles [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] So, what would your perfect meal be, then?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I don't -- I don't know, well if they didn't have any calories that let you eat --
R:  Yeah right.
L:  -- lots of dessert [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's it [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No calories, no carbs [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah [inaudible]
R:  I'm on the low carbs --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I've been -- I've been really trying on that and I'm -- I'm a bread and potatoes person so it's hard.
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't think I could do it, I -- I just -- you know, I need the carbs --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  But --
R:  It's -- I do find it easier though than, than I ever thought it would be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you just, I just eat one less piece of bread or I eat one -- don't eat a potato with a meal or something, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fill up on like chicken, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm a big fan of chicken salads or you know a salad with chicken --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and everything else in it as well.  I like going out for salads --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I love a salad bar --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I think that's good.  I could ca- -- I could care less about necessarily even eating any um, meat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I -- I don't care about that either, um, not that I'm a vegetarian because I don't eat vegetables either, but [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I definitely find meat, I mean, it's something I you know need to eat but --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- not something I eat a lot --
R:  Do you?
L:  I don't have anything against it, it's just you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and when you don't cook for yourself then it's ah, not much of an incentive to keep meat around.
R:  No it's not, it's not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, tonight I came home, I had a few potato chips for my dinner [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That was it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I ate lunch late and I usually don't eat a big lunch and I ate leftover Chinese --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So, um -- you know.
L:  Yeah, I went out to dinner actually for pizza tonight.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  Yeah, it was pretty good, although I got like a small, a petite pizza that was so small, it was so much smaller than I expected it to be --
R:  You needed two of them [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it was a like a six inch and I guess I didn't realise how small a six inch pizza is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it's like, it's like a single serving microwave sized pizza --
R:  Oh wow, that is small isn't it.
L:  It was so tiny, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was just not very filling [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Anyhow, we have these restaurants near us though too that, um, I mean, wh- there's one restaurant -- it's actually like in a little um, little tiny parking lot with like a gas station next door to it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they serve the best Italian food and they give you so much food --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- for such a reasonable price.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, it's [inaudible] -- it's a hole, but people drive from all over to come to it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, and it is very reasonable and I don't mind going up there -- it's quick, the service is good, they're friendly, it's real home townie --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the, the food is not home townie, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not like lots of you know just gravies and things like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's, he's, he's actually Greek and ah he has a --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, but a good flavor in it.
L:  Oh, that sounds good.
R:  Yeah, it's really good.
L:  Yeah, that's the nice thing about most Italian restaurants, is they serve big, big portions.
R:  Yeah, yes they do.  The, um, my, my -- I guess if I were to talk about my favorite meal it would have to have something a lot -- I -- I love cheese --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I love pastas.
L:  Mm, mhm.
R:  Like I said, I could care less about meat necessarily, I eat a lot of chicken --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I eat pork, I don't like beef, I just don't like beef, I get tired of chewing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's, that's really why I don't eat it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I eat hamburger and that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't have anything against it at all, but --
L:  Yeah, sometimes, I mean I like really good steak but only like, you know, twice a year --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you know hamburgers occasionally --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and that's about all the beef I eat.
R:  Yeah, and see my husband's a, um, you know, definite meat and potatoes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, just loves his beef and loves his potatoes --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I'm like, "Oh, you go ahead and have that, I'm going to have a chicken salad" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] He gets tired of that too, but he's a good sport about it, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I like -- I like chicken.  I actually have tried to give up pork because -- not for any like health reasons -- but because I -- I worry about the way it's farmed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so I've sort of tried to eat it less --
R:   Yeah.
L:  -- just because, I don't know, you know, it's a -- it's a little, I'm not like a crazy um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know environmentalist or anything, but I just read stories and I --
R:  I don't know, I think if you really delved into how a lot of um meat, or how all meats are farmed [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- scary.
L:  It's a little scary, I mean, for most things it doesn't bother me, it's just that I think it has such a like bad effect on the people that live hear the hog farms --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's really what concerns me, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- more than anything else, it's like, it's horrible that people should be getting sick and --
R:  Exactly --
L:  -- because --
R:  -- and now we're eating this.
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, we all have to have ham all the time, and I love ham but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I've tried to cu-
R:  See, I don't -- I don't like ham.
L:  Really?
R:  I love bacon, I don't like ham.
L:   Hm.
R:  Isn't that funny?
L:  That is funny.
R:  And um, and I don't know why.  It may be again more the texture of the meat, I'm -- I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm just, it's the same like I say with steak I just get tired of chewing it, I just don't like that, that texture in my mouth --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  So --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah I don't know, I like, I definitely like really good ham --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like when my mom makes it or you know --
R:  Well moms always make the best food.
L:  Ah, very true, very true [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] Mom's food over a restaurant, that's what I would say [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but the restaurants these days are, it's just convenient, you know what I mean --
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  -- you know, just to pop in, have a meal, I mean, it's not re- -- it's different than, than going out to a restaurant was years ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, where you actually get dressed and you go out for an evening, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you just pop in, you eat, you socialize for a little bit and, and you come home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, it's definitely, I mean there's so many times when I'm just so busy I can't even go home and heat up a frozen dinner to eat --
R:  Yeah exactly --
L:  I just have to go out.
R:  -- well that's why I had chips tonight [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, I was like, I looked in my refrigerator, I have a five year old, and I fed her, and she's a great eater, and she'll eat anything --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I put in front of her --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I fed her and then got her to bed and I'm like, "And now what do I want?", and just poking around, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and where I live we have nothing close, we have no take out --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we have, you have to really drive a long distance even just for fast food --
L:  Oh, that's inconvenient.
R:  It is, but it is not, actually the worst part was when I first moved in here, nobody still delivers pizza [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I learned to make my own pizza, though.
L:  Oh, well, I guess that's good.
R:  It was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was, but --
L:  Yeah, I've, I've never made my own pizza, actually.
R:  You have to really get a good crust.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean that's -- it's -- it's -- to me, if you don't have a good flavor in the crust, forget it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, and, and the sauce, you have to have the, you know, the, the sauce and the crust and you can put anything on top of a pizza --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, unless you want like a white pizza, now those, those I like too.
L:  Yeah, I -- well, you have to have a pizza stone or something for your oven don't you?
R:  Yeah, I mean it helps, it makes the crust that much better --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but um, I used to -- I shouldn't say I used to, I have a bread machine and I used to make my pizza dough all the time --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in there and um, and, and it was good, I just haven't done it in a really long time, in fact I packed up the ju- -- the bread machine just the other day --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, um, yeah, but I'm, ah, and the other thing I like about going out to restaurants though are the good bread that you get --
L:  Oh yes, definitely.
R:  -- oh, I could sit and just fill up on the bread.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  Warm -- those warm loaves they put on the table, or warm --
L:  Oh, I really like it when you get like a good loaf of sourdough or something like that --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- has a lot of flavor --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That stuff's really good.
R:  Ahah, and if they just put a little olive oil on a little dish too, that doesn't hurt [LAUGH].
L:  Ooh, mm, yes [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know, I think I might be getting hungry, I maybe I'll need to go and eat --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- after I -- we hang up [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  I know, it's -- it's fortunate I just ate --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or else I'd be getting hungry too.
R:  I should've called earlier [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Those potato chips might not hit the spot any longer.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you go out, do you eat out often?
L:  I eat out a lot because I'm, I'm pretty busy --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I'm not a very good cook and I have a very -- I live in a small apartment with a very small kitchen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, it's hard to cook and keep it clean and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] -- keep things in the fridge that won't spoil [SIGH] --
R:  uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I mostly go, well, I -- I'm trying to go out to eat less because I -- it's just too expensive, but --
R:  It does get -- it adds up.
L:  But, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- it's only so-so successful at this point [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] A little bit at a time.
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, I eat breakfast at home [LAUGH] that's something [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well there you go.
L:  I pack my lunch, or I try to --
R:  There you go, that's a big saving.
L:  -- but it's dinner, dinner is the worst part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
