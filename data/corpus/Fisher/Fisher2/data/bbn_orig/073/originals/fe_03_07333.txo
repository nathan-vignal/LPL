R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah.  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Now I forgot -- I -- I didn't -- what's your name?
L:  Dominique. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi.  My name is Della.
L:  Hi.
R:  Now, the question was -- what'd she say after seven days?
L:  What?
R:  What do you do to keep yourself ...?
L:  Well?
R:  Yeah.  What do you do? [NOISE]
L:  Well, if I feel like I'm getting sick -- I mean, you know, depending on what the symptoms are -- how I feel, you know, I just take some medicine.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Or, you know -- I mean, I'm really not -- the seasons really don't have any affect on me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause, you know, like, when people have, like -- they're allergic to something or, like, their allergies bother them. [NOISE]  But, it really doesn't bother me.
R:  [NOISE] It doesn't bother me either.  I don't have allergies either.  And I think a lot of times -- well, I'm -- became very conscious now of washing my hands all the time.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Very much so. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And I believe it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- also stress related.  I know that when I get into a bad mood or I have some -- a problem or something that I have my -- I get sick a lot quicker.  How 'bout you?
L:  [NOISE] Mm, not really with me.  I mean, I really -- I really don't get sick a lot just to be honest.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I really don't.  I don't know why that it.
R:  Are you young?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Eighteen.
R:  Eighteen?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Well, that's considered young.
L:  Hm.
R:  And that's -- that's probably why. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So, [NOISE] I don't know what other sick they're talking about.  I think that they're -- the whole big stuff going on about mosquitos and about all that stuff.  How would you protect yourself from that?
L:  Well, get a repellent like Off or something that just, like, keeps the mosquitos away from me.  Either that or I just won't go outside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  No, I -- I don't -- you know, they're really, really talking about with all that water and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they have that -- that stuff, D.E.E.T. or something.
L:  B.E.E.T.? 
R:  Well, also because the ticks, if you're in the grass or you're in all that stuff.
L:  Ah --
R:  The ticks also are not so terrific.
L:  [MN]
R:  There's a lot of things we have to fight off now, huh?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Did you hear about that new sickness? [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] I think the [several inaudible words] the mosquitos [NOISE] the main thing they're worried about, because they can fly.  And even --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if you, like, swat 'em away they just might come back after you and bite you, and only God knows what it could be.
R:  It's scary.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Are you working now or you home?
L:  I'm at home.
R:  Oh, okay. Go to school?
L:  Mhm. Of course.
R:  Oh, very nice.  Good.  Do you talk -- you don't talk about these kind of things -- you don't talk about current events in -- and we used to talk about a lot of that stuff in school.  When I was younger they used to talk about, um, you know, current events. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and they would bring up the fact that mosquitos are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- scary nowadays.  And --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  They don't do that in school now, right?
L:  Mm, it --  it all depends on which class you're in if they'll talk about, you know, current events and stuff like [NOISE] that. [NOISE]  But, I -- I don't mind talking about current events, you know.  I ke- -- I kind of keep up with what's going around -- around the world, you know.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, even though some of the stuff don't con- don't concern [NOISE] me, you know, it's good to know.
R:  Of course -- of course.  And how'd find this?
L:  Mm?
R:  How'd you find this out?  With --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the -- with the school survey.
L:  Um, you know, [MN] I'd heard some family members talking about it.
R:  Oh, very nice.  It's a good way to earn some, ah, extra cash, right?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Not bad.  What happens in ten minutes?  Do they shut off on their own?
L:  Well, I'm not really sure.
R:  Is this the first time you're doing it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  My first time.
R:  [NOISE] So, let me ask you a question.  Do you take vitamin C?  Do you take anything to prepare yourself in case of illness?  Or, are you -- just because you're eighteen you have that natural defense mechanism?
L:  Well, being that I really don't get sick a lot I think it's because, you know, I have that natural system.  But, if I do have, like, some vitamin C or anything around I take it, you know, just to be safe, you know. 
R:  Did you ever hear of echinacea?
L:  I've heard about it, but I don't -- I don't even know what it is.
R:  It's -- it's -- it's -- if you ever feel a cold coming on you take it.  It's a natural -- supposed to be a natural way -- instead of -- well, I guess, along with vitamin C.  But, if you take echinacea it's, um -- it's also good to, ah, help you -- resistance.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's all about resistance.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I need to get some of that.  [NOISE]  Just be prepared, you know, for future references and all. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, if we ever get a summer maybe, ah -- [PAUSE] I don't know where you're calling from, but I don't -- summer hasn't been too terrific around here.
L:  Hm.  Where are you at?
R:  New York.
L:  New York?
R:  And you?
L:  Hm, I'm in Minneapolis.
R:  Oh, the weather there is so different.
L:  Yep.
R:  Is it --
L:  The weather --
R:  -- warm --
L:  -- here is --
R:  -- there now?
L:  The weather here is crazy.  It's be -- it'll be sunny one minute -- be raining the next -- it will be hot the next minute.
R:  See --
L:  Then it's -- it's then it'll be cold the next minute.  It's crazy.
R:  And you get crazy winters.
L:  [LAUGH] Cold ones.
R:  Snow too?
L:  Yes.
R:  See, it's -- when it cold it's when you don't get sick.  That's --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- -- the best part about it.
L:  [NOISE] I usually don't go anywhere in winter anyway.  I only do if I have to.
R:  What?  To go out in the winter?
L:  Yeah.  I'm not too fond of the cold.
R:  And you're in Minneapolis?  You're --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- in the wrong place.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  I just recently moved from, ah, Wisconsin.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, you know, if it's sunny in the morning then it'll -- it'll be sunny all day.
R: Where you used to live?
L:  I moved here from Madison, Wisconsin, and Maisy Minnie[?], Wisconsin.  I stayed --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- in Madison for eight years, and I stayed in Maisy Minnie for one year.
R:  and the climate there is the same as where you are now, no?
L:  Oh, no -- no.  It's -- it's different.
R:  In Wisconsin how's the climate there?
L:  Well, it's warmer in Wisconsin.  And the news people are usually right about how's it gonna be there.  You know, if they say it's gonna be sunny, it's -- it's gonna be sunny.  But, here it's a gamble.
R:  Yeah.  Any --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah, here --
L:  They --
R:  -- too. 
L:  They really don't know what it's gonna be.  They say it'll be sunny and it'll be raining.
R:  So, you don't even know the -- what to -- wh- when you go out what proper clothing to wear e- ev- even.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Ha.
L:  Most people know that Minneapolis is cold, so they usually just double up on stuff in the winter.
R:  Well, I hear Minneapolis is real cold.
L:  Yeah, it's true.
R:  Real cold.  So, you moved to -- with family?
L:  Yeah, family.
R:  So, that's nice. [PAUSE]  Nice to be with family.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How long you there?
L:  I've been here since last summer.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So, I got here when it's warm -- or I had at least, yeah[?]. [NOISE]  And right -- right when I got settled in, you know, it got colder after a while.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [MN] [NOISE] So, I don't know what -- much more to talk about sickness.  I'm a mother.  I have chil- -- I have a son who's not -- he's older than you, so --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- you know.  Um, it was pretty, ah, nerving worrying about him getting sick.  Everybody used to laugh at me because I used to always worry about him getting sick.  And I was always told him to make sure he wore a scarf or a hat or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so, they all imitate me now that he's twenty seven -- "Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's gonna put on a hat -- he's gonna put on a hat".  So, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- was always afraid of him getting sick.  He used to re- -- get really sick.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I think, um, they had me marked down as a neurotic mother --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- although I'm really not.  But, I still worry 'bout him getting sick. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, of course, yeah.  That's your son, you know.  You gonna worry about him.
R:  Of cour- -- now he's going to Mexico and I still worry about him getting sick.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  He's going to Mexico, and I know the food -- if you drink the water there you could sick.  I know it happened to me.
L:  Really?
R:  If you drink the water in Mexico -- because they don't have the same sewer system and stuff like that --
L:  Oh.
R:  I got sick for about six weeks. So --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- now he's going to Mexico.  So, it's, you know, "Don't drink the -- be careful with the water.  Don't drink the water.  Don't have ice cubes.  Only eat fruit that you peel by yourself.  Don't --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- eat anything that they wash" 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's all anti -- it's all bacteria that you're -- that we're not -- our bodies are not familiar with.
L:  Yeah, there's a difference.
R:  Yes.  And now that -- I'm worried that too.  A mother's job is never done.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Does your mother live where you are now?
L:  Yep.  Mm, she worries.
R:  And we drive you guys crazy, huh?
L:  Of course, unfortunately.  But, you know, she's my mother and I love her.
R:  Aw.  You sound like a good kid.  What are you gonna do when you get older?
L:  Well --
R:  You have --
L:  --I --
R:  -- any desires?
L:  I'd like to be an actor.
R:  [SIGH] I can't believe you said that.  That's what my son does.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?  Why'd you pick that?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I just -- seems like I can do it and if -- if you could see, like, the way that I act and -- I don't know -- I probably could get away with it.  Like --
R:  Dramatic you want, or ...?
L:  Yeah.  I could -- I c- -- I -- I could play just about any part, you know.  I've got evil, then it be good[?] and, you know --
R:  Do you do any shows in school?
L:  Mm, no, not lately because when -- let me see.  The last big school I went to was in eighth grade.  This was in Wisconsin.  And ever since ninth and tenth and -- those have been small schools.
R:  There's a lot of summer stock[?], and there's a lot of theater in your local churches and a lot of that stuff.  That is very important on a resume -- very important on a resume.
L:  When I was younger I wanted to be a photographer 'cause I like taking pictures too.
R:  Right.  Well, you could --
