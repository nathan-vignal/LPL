L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm Julie.
R:  Hi.  I'm Lynda.
L:  Hi.  It's nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.  Okay, so the topic was i- illness?  
L:  I guess.  
R:  And when it --
L:  Seasonal illness --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sort of.
R:  Right.  Illness and, um, do you get sick when the seasons change and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what do you do?  [SIGH] Um -- well, lately I've noticed as I'm getting older I'm developing, like, allergies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and sinuses and, um, last week it was really bad.  I mean, I had like a sinus headache for, um -- it lasted, like, for three days.  You know, like --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- on and off.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um -- I mean, my -- my head hurt, my stomach hurt, ah, a- at one moment I wanted to eat, the next moment I didn't wanna eat, um --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  I got, like, um, like, hot flashes, like, I was, you know, overheating.
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] And, um, you know, I -- I said, "I need to really go to the doctor to try to get, um, you know, some medicine for it".  Because over c- -- over the counter the only thing that seems to help was -- was, um, Advil cold and sinus.  But, you know, like everything else it just seemed like I was taking things but, you know, nothing was really happening. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, to -- to elevate, you know, the pressure.
L:  I see.  So, do you go to the doctor?
R:  Not yet. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Not yet.  I haven't going to get --
L:  You're just, like, sticking with the Advil?
R:  Yeah.  But last week it was -- it was a really bad -- a really bad week.  I mean, one day I did have to call out from work because, um, my head just felt so heavy.  I mean, it -- I told somebody else it felt like I had marbles, or rocks or something in my head, and if I just tilted it one way, like, they all slid.  You know, it just --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my God.  That sounds horrible.
R:  -- it -- yeah, you know and that's how -- that's the only way I could describe it and I just -- just could not -- feel like I wanted to get out of bed so [SIGH] I didn't go to work.
L:  Well, good. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And, you know  [LAUGH]
L:  That makes sense.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't -- yeah.  I've been having sort of allergies lately.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But not like I have marbles in my head.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just my eyes itch.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah, I don- -- I don't know if there's anything you can do to prevent allergies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like regular illness I guess there is. [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Echinacea, and what not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But allergies, I don't know.  You just can't go outside.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, so I -- you know, I don't know -- I mean, besides that I don't really have -- I mean -- I mean, I'm blessed basically with good health.  I don't really have [SIGH] anything else that comes on with the seasons.  Sometimes, in the winter time -- or I guess my biggest thing is just different types of headache because I know, like, in the winter time I will seem like I'll get headaches and they're a little different [inaudible] --
L: Yeah.
R:  More so the, um, like, a, um, a migraine.  Migraine's like when -- when it's really, you know, cold outside and [inaudible] and um --
L:  Yeah.  I get those --
R:  Do you really?  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sometimes -- sometimes the only thing that helps is being quiet and some place that's dark and, you know, [MN] just -- just laying down really for the migraine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that's what I- -- that's what I've found.  Sometimes I don't even wanna take, you know, take anything.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  Well, it doesn't seem to do much good.  I think if you stay warm so you're muscles don't ten- tense up as much.
R:  Is that what it is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the wint- -- with the -- with the cold?
L:  Yeah.  Well, that was my theory, this last --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- winter 'cause I kept getting migraines and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just had to think about why --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was because I was tensed all winter long, so 
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  That's what I think mine seem like -- you know, like, to come in the winter months and I -- I was, like, you know, I'm -- I mean, I really didn't have any explanation for why it was, you know, why it would seem to happen.  You know, when it --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- cold, you know.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So.
L:  It's so bizarre.
R:  Mhm.  It really is.  You know, a cold one and then I mean [LAUGH] -- and I never had allergies or anything like that or sinus -- [SIGH] never had anything like that and it's just --
L:  Oh, and are you allergic to anything else or is it just, like ?
R:  No.  Not allergic to anything, like, not unless, you know, like with age I'm developing, you know, like some -- some different, you know like, allergies.  But I mean, never like -- like I've -- not [several inaudible words] person, like I can't eat strawberries --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- or if some people can't stale fish or different things.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nothing like that at all.  
L:  That's so strange.
R:  Mhm.  And -- and -- and it just seems, like, um, they just, um, it's just, um, getting really -- really bad as, um, as I get older.  But it seems like I have -- I'll have a few maybe when -- when the weather starts to get warm and then I won't have, you know, like any more, you know, it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- real- really at the -- like the beginning of the onset of summer and then, you know, it kinda like dies down and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that's prob- -- that's probably why I haven't, like, really gone to the doctor.  I guess if it persisted and stayed longer I would probably [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  But hopefully -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- be going to seek a relief. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] it'll go away on it's own.  Yes.
R:  Uh huh.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But, um, besides that, that's, um -- I mean, you know, like basically it.  I don't have any that, um, you know, like anything else besides, um  what do they say?  They come with the season, [LIPSMACK] um --
L:  I don't know.  I mean, summer, that's the allergies.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Winter, that's the migraines. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know spring.  I don't know [LAUGH] --
R:  R- r- right.
L:  -- if there's an illness that I can really --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- associate with that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.  And, that's, ah -- I mean, with times of the year but this is all year long.  But I do notice that, um, that I do suffer from, like, PMS.
L:   Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  And --
L:  I don- -- yeah. [LAUGH] That's more like a monthly thing --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- rather than, like, [LAUGH] than a state of the whole thing.  But, oh, yeah.
R:  That's what I say, that's, like, all year long right.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.  It's ho- --
R:  They don't get any better or worse with the weather.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I took a women's psychology class.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was talking about PMS and it -- it came from, like, a really feminist perspective so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was expecting it to say, like, --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, "Be nice to women during that".
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But, no, it -- it said that there are no studies that can prove that it actually exists.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, that it's all just a figment of our imagination and --
R:  Mm.
L:  Oh, man.  I was so angry. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  When I heard that it was, like, [LAUGH] "You know, tell a woman with PMS that PMS doesn't exist".
R:  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you. [LAUGH] 
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm am telling you so -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't -- I -- you know.  I said that -- that, um, [LIPSMACK] that is definitely not -- I mean, I just get -- sometimes I just get so angry, you know?
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  And it's like, "Why?".  You know?  And it -- and you -- it's like -- like a dripping faucet, like you can't turn it off, you know.  It's just once it hits the onset, it's there and it's just, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's just, like, so hard to just, like, shut it down.  You're just so angry.  It's like --
L:  It's true. [NOISE]   And, you see it happening and you just --
R:  But you ca- -- Yep? [LAUGH]
L:  -- that -- but I feel that -- like, the worst thing is that I get really angry but I, for whatever reason, just feel that I'm justified [LAUGH] --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- whereas other times I wouldn't feel like that at all.  It's, like, "Yeah.  I'm angry and I don't care if I'm angry".  And I'm like -- I don't -- you just feel like you're the biggest -- or at least I just feel like I just deserve to be angry if I wanna be. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  But, I don't know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's so bizarre.
R:  Yeah.  That's the truth.
L:  Right.  Well, I'm glad that you think that it exists too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It makes me feel better.  I'm --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- not going crazy.
R:  Well, I definitely do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  Besides that, um -- like I said besides that I don't really suffer from any, um, you know, any other illnesses, um, you know.  I know they say they come on with the season -- I mean, but I -- I have a family history of, um, heart disease and, um, [SIGH] high blood pressure and diabetes.  So, you know, in that respect I do, you know, have to try to pay attention and be careful too, you know  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  So, what precautions will you take for that sort of thing?
R:  Um, just basically, um -- just my diet and exercise.  Trying to watch I eat and just, um, you know, just trying to monitor it.  You know, monitor it as much as I can.  So, I think I'm, like, one of the only ones of my siblings that, um, really doesn't suffer with -- maybe, it might be a coup- -- maybe two or three of us that don't really have high blood pressure, um -- but you know.  I think there's three or four of us that do, you know so far.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [several inaudible words] if you take care of yourself, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Good.  Pays off. [SIGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yep.  So, that's -- that's really hard 'cause my dad passed from, you know, heart disease and he --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had a pace maker installed and everything, but, you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.  And, he was only fifty five.
L:  Oh!  That's horrible.
R:  Isn't that?  And I -- you know, and at that time I really didn't realize how young that was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  And, now I look at it because I'll be forty this year and I'm like, "Wow", you know.  He was really young.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Oh, that's -- that's so sad.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, makes me wanna be more careful too. [LAUGH] I really should be.
R:  Mhm.  Right.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't smoke which is good, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, so that -- that helps a lot.  Well, I never really did so  And I don't drink so that's, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the sort of things that really [NOISE] -- really help I guess. [NOISE]
L:  True.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Um  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Trying to think more -- more illnesses. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not a very optimistic conversation. [LAUGH]
R:  You're right.  No, it's not, you know.  And, I know, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know, it just seems like a- -- I'm just thinking about like, um, cancer because a lot of people don't -- I don't know -- ah, well, breast cancer they -- they talk about a lot and, um  [PAUSE] [SIGH]  But, it just seemed like it was one of those things where it kinda like -- they weren't really talking about it a lot but so many people are really suffering from, you know, all types of cancer.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  An- -- you know.
L:  It's amazing to me actually when you read the statistics about --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how many people actually die from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and do anything about it is just -- 
R:  Right.  I'm me- o- --
L:  -- ridiculous. 
R:  Yeah.
