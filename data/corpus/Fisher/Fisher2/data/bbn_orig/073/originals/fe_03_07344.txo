R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, hi -- I'm --
R:  Hi, I'm Kelly.
L:  What's -- Kelly?
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm Chrissie, hi.
R:  Hi Chrissie --
L:  Wh- -- 
R:  -- where are you from? 
L:  Boston, Massachussetts.
R:  Oh, okay okay.
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Ah, right, now I'm living in South Carolina.
L:  Okay, that's what I was going to say, down south by the accent.
R:  No, I don't have an accent [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, you do, a little bit.
R:  You should hear some of these people [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh I know, I know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] So --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I guess the topic is illness?
R:  I guess so.
L:  So, do you normally get sick when the seasons change?
R:  Um, [MN] generally not -- mine, mine all seems to be stress related, not season related.
L:  [NOISE] Which makes sense [NOISE].
R:  But -- no, we just moved down here, um, right around Christmas, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like allergies and stuff, fortunately I haven't had any problems but, um, there's a lot of pine trees down here, and I mean you'll go out and your -- your vehicle's just coated --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- with this yellow stuff, it's, it's unreal.  Um, I notice -- I work in HR and -- I notice a lot of people coming in, you know, with sinus problems --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and everything, so -- I'm just glad it wasn't me.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, I usually, for some reason, seem to get sick every February --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- it -- it wouldn't really be season related because I mean, it's already winter then and it's not getting warm yet, so I don't know what the reason is, but it seems like the last couple of Februaries I always get hit with either bronchitis, or just a really bad cold.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Which I mean, it's good like -- actually last year like I knew to expect it and I started taking this thing called elderberry somebody had told me about and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it just -- as soon as I started to feel sick I took it and it just knocked it out of my system -- it's like --
R:  Oh, so you didn't have the problem last year, then?
L:  No, not at all, it -- I think I beat it, I found my miracle cure [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It's --
R:  Mental note to self -- elderberry.
L:  Yeah, seriously, now I always know to keep a jar of it in my medicine cabinet --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- which -- [inaudible]
R:  I've heard so many people say like, vitamin C, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] it, it's -- I've done it, but it doesn't do anything for me anyhow [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I mean, I drink juice all the time and [several inaudible words] help me.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I had actually had gone to the, um, like the health food store just to get some echinacea 'cause I knew that  --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I had heard about and, when I went there, the guy working there told me like elderberry, 'cause I guess echinacea is once you're already sick, and elderberry prevents you from getting sick.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I was like, "Well, that's good to know".
R:  'Cause I -- I tried that too, 'cause they had a big hype a -- a couple of years ago, you know, when it came out and I'm like, "Hey, you know, I'll, I'll try anything" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, but, no, that, that didn't seem to do it for me either, but I normally don't take it to prevent, you know --
L:  Yeah, so, apparently that's -- I don't know, it worked for me, I just like took one every day for, you know, a two month period there and I never got sick, so ...
R:  Hm.
L:   It's a little tip for you -- a little miracle cure [LAUGH].
R:  No doubt -- scribbling notes to myself here [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] But yeah, I mean, other than that I mean, I get allergies just like in the early spring usually, like around now and -- but I just take allergy pills and whatever, but as far as little colds and stuff -- I'm usually pretty good with avoiding them.
R:  I haven't been too bad recently, um, the past couple of years, but when I -- when I started working, when I got out of high school, I worked um, in banks for a couple of years and I noticed that, I mean, I caught bronchitis, you know, at least twice every winter --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and, um, then the last bank I worked at I um was, you know, was, was okay, but then I went to like an office job where you're -- you're working with the same people --
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  -- and ah, I did notice that my, my sniffles and everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seemed to decrease, um --
L:  Which makes sense 'cause you're not --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- seeing random people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and little kids and everything.
R:  Yeah, yeah -- course there was this one lady there that it's like, "God, would you just go home" -- [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's the worst -- when there's people that go to work when they're sick 'cause they know they should and it's like, "No, you're going to get everybody sick -- go home".
R:  I know, I know, like, "Go home".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, she's fifty feet away and she's like [COUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you're like, "Ooh" [LAUGH].
L:  You need a little mask to go to work.
R:  Pretty much [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  But ah, I don't even know -- what were the other topics we were supposed to talk about?  [LAUGH]  
R:  Ah --
L:   Related to this -- they only said like, four things.
R:  I don't know, my husband's like, "Hey honey, are you still doing that phone st- ...", I'm like, "Yes, give me the phone" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it's the -- the last couple of times they've called me it's like, just as I sit down to dinner, or just as I get in the shower and I'm like, "Well [LAUGH], finally one where I'm not doing anything".
R:  Yes, well we just logged in from today -- um, it was something about illness and ah, like allergies, and, I don't remember exactly what else.
L:  Yeah, I know they said like four questions related to it -- like, do you normally sick at the seasons?  --
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you do to prevent it?  And, something like that ...
R:  I think we've covered all that.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  In the first five minutes -- okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, yeah, so [LIPSMACK] -- what else can we talk about related to illness?
R:  Um --
L:  I don't even know -- unless you want to talk about SARS -- that's good --
R:  Yeah, no doubt.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I just ah, read in the newspaper there was a new case up in Toronto.
L:  Oh really, another one?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Jeeze.
R:  So, yeah I know, but you know, if it's not that it's monkey pox.
L:  Oh yeah, there'll always be something.
R:  You know, there's, there's always something going on.
L:  Oh -- well, as long as it stays out of the United States, I'm okay with that.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Although I'm sure once summer really kicks in, it'll be the whole West Nile thing again.
R:  Oh god, my hus- -- my friend's husband had that.
L:  Oh really.
R:  I mean, it -- this guy about died, you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  He's one of those string bean people to begin with and he lost like, twenty pounds --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  -- he was out of commission for about six weeks -- he went into the hospital twice, they didn't know what it was and then they finally, "Well, let's test for this ...", and the CDC in Indianapolis said it was the worse case in his age group that they'd ever encountered --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but, supposedly, um, if he was to ever get bit again he would, you know he would have built up some immunity to it.
L:  Well, that's good at least.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  That's good though that -- I mean, I didn't think -- not that many people survive that get -- get it, right?  -- Isn't it ...?
R:  No, I mean it, it's you know, pretty high, but --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I guess most of the people that died were more um, elderly, or --
L:  Right, and I guess -- I mean you really only hear about the ones that die from it, you don't ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's -- you don't hear about the ones who recover, you know, that's not newsworthy --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] But um, since we moved down South Carolina, we're also on the lake, and I tell you, the mosquitoes just eat me alive --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- although I haven't really heard anything about West Nile this year.
L:  Not yet, well I know all of northeast it's just been raining and cold so we haven't had a chance to even have any mosquitoes --
R:  Na, na, na, na, na [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, we've been really lucky this year, with snow, freezing weather and then now rain --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's it -- and now it -- I actually live just outside of Boston, I live in Gloster[?] -- I always just say Boston 'cause it's less -- more people know that -- and I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right down, right down the street from the beach and it's like, I'm waiting to go to the beach and it's just been so cold.
R:  Oh, you should come down here, it's wonderful out [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  My husband just loves it down here, so and -- ah, I think it gets a little bit hot but, ah, we'll see as I go through my first summer and we'll see what happens here.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah -- well, don't get sick.
R:  Yeah, I'm trying not to, but now I know about esha- esh- +echinacea [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, it's the elderberry --
R:  -- and elderberry, yes, I can pronounce that one [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] But yeah, I mean there's not really many sicknesses you can get in the summer anyhow, unless you're you know, a little kid and you can get swimmers' ear, or whatever [MN].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- I don't even know what else [several inaudible words] I can say [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Particularly cold and flu.  I don't know that that many people really get colds and flus -- other than like little children, I think it's moreso.
R:  Well, yeah, because of the, the hand washing and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- lack thereof, but --
L:  I mean, what about flu shot -- do you normally get flu shots?
R:  You know, I used to, um -- when I worked at the bank, um, you know, they would offer it, and then I also worked at a retirement community and, and they offered it too, but um, the past couple of years I haven't -- the first year I was sort of edgy, like, "Oh, you know, I now I'm going to regret this", and now I don't even think about it, it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, I'm not really sure that it was beneficial.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, 'cause I thought, "Oh, flu shot, great, I won't get the flu" --
L:  Right.
R:  Until I read the article that there's a hundred and fifty different varieties of flu and they think this one's going to be prevalent this year --
L:  Jeeze, and it's not the one -- oh --
R:  -- and I'm like, "Okay" [LAUGH].
L:  Well I nev-, I never -- the -- my work gives it away for free every year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I never get it because I'm like -- I've heard so many things about how it can give you flu symptoms, and --
R:  [MN] Yeah --
L:  -- all this other stuff and I'm like [inaudible].
R:  -- I've -- I've heard that too -- the only thing my arm always got a little bit sore, but nothing, you know --
L:  Nothing too tragic.
R:  -- no, I mean, nothing unbearable --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so ...
L:  Yeah, and you know, the risk of getting it from getting the shot, like infecting myself basically, always scared me away.
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  Like I might as well take my chances and see if I get it.
R:  Yeah, well you know, after reading about how many strains there are, I'm like, "Oh forget it, you know -- I'll take my chances".
L:  Yeah, seriously, if they're not going to be able to get all of them in the one shot.
R:  And besides, I mean, they always say that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, if it's a virus we can do something and, you know, if it's a -- do I have it backwards?  Whatever -- anyhow, you know, I always feel the same, regardless if they tell me it's a virus or not.
