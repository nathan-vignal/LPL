R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Lauren.
R:  [NOISE] Hi.  I'm Julie.
L:  Hi, Julie. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  We- -- I'm in Philadelphia.  Where are you?
R:  Florida.
L:  Florida.  Very cool.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  All right, so --
R:  That's a bit -- a bit of a distance. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  But, same time of night, huh?
R:  Mhm. 
L:  All right.
R:  Well, I guess that wouldn't affect the, ah, question then since, ah, seasonal.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't understand the last question in that.  [MN] Do we both get affected by seasonal illness and then, what was the last part?
R:  Um, if you go to see a doctor about it.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't think I would consider it that serious to see a doctor unless maybe you're clinically depressed and it makes it worse.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I -- I never have either, um -- has it been raining in Florida?  It -- we've had, like, let's see today and I think it was yesterday we had two nice days but before that we've ha- -- not just had, like -- we've just had rainy weather for the last twenty eight days I think it was.  
R:  Right. [SIGH]
L:  Have you had the same?
R:  Um, not that bad but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we have had a lot of rain.
L:  Uh-huh.  It's been pretty intense.  I don't know, [MN] have you ever felt yourself in the past getting seasonal, you know ?
R:  Yes.  Usually I'm affected by winter summer changes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, winter I'll get a little bit more depressed, in summer I get more energetic.
L:  And when you say depressed that means, like, anti social or what does that mean for you?
R:  Um, it -- it's like mild symptoms of -- like, ah, anti social yeah and just kind of apathetic on things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right, it's like everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I used to like to do I'm almost half -- half hearted about it.
L:  Right.  I don't -- I never label it but, I guess, I knew I did -- I get forlorn and like that, kinda like, just less energetic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I know, like, when I go outside and if I exercise, particularly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with other people, like if I go running or rollerblading or something, it always peps me up again.
R:  Yeah.  Exercise does seem to do that.
L:  Yeah.  Bu- --
R:  Often getting outside and just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dragging yourself out into the weather, whether it's nice or not can also do it.
L:  I agr- -- I have a dog.  Do you have one?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  So, what kind of dog do you have?
R:  A Maltese.
L:  Oh, I like them.  They're fun.  I have a big mutt. [LAUGH]
R:  A big mutt. [LAUGH]
L:  A big mutt [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who actually has lime's disease.  I'm just going --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- through medicating her for that.  But, um, I know --
R:  And, what's her name?
L:  Her name is Casco.
R:  Casco.
L:  What's your dog -- what's the Maltese name?
R:  Odie.
L:  Odie?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wh- -- from, ah -- who's Odie?
R:  Garfield.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  Got it.
R:  That comic strip.
L:  Um  [LIPSMACK] what was I going to say?  I --
R:  Yeah, if you get outside with the dog, that helps.
L:  Exactly.  And, like -- and we see all the types of weather and, like, when other people sometimes bitch about, for me, like, the rain or it's too cold out or whatever.  I'm like, "Whatever".  Like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I remember when I first got her.  I had never had an animal before and I remember her like, you know, she was just getting used to it and I think she was sick and she had to go to bathroom a few times, like [MN] -- like, two in the morning kinda thing, and she was waking me up to go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, she has these Christmas bells on the door that she rings when she wants to really go out. [LAUGH] And, she's ringing the bells and I went outside with her and at first -- I remember the first time I was like, "Oh, God" -- I'm standing there and after she went to the bathroom she, like -- you know how they lay down on their front paws, they're touching the air and they wanna play? 
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  So -- and she started to play and I was like, "This is so nice", like, she doesn't know any better.  She doesn't know that I need to go to be at work in the morning, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and it -- and it's like, you know what, you need to enjoy it.  And then sometimes I, like, look up and I see the stars and [LIPSMACK] -- I live in the city in Philadelphia but there's park here -- a lot of park and at nighttime, like, particularly at- -- it's -- it's probably August maybe.  I don't know.  When we have the cicadas out.  You know when they're out?  They've really --
R:  What is it called?
L:  Cicadas?  They're these --
R:  OH.
L:  -- loud flying, some type of insect and they make a "[MN]" noise.  
R:  I haven't --
L:  They're really loud.
R:  Wow.  The only thing we have around here are mosquitoes. [LAUGH]
L:  Ugh.  O- -- well they -- you know what they sou- --
R:  Plen- plenty of them.
L:  It sounds like the bug --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- zappers from mosquito bugs zappers.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  "Z- z- z-".  But really crazy sounding.  And, ah, and sometimes bothers me, but at the same time, it's like, I experience it because of her.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, like, I like that.  I don't know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, even -- even with seasonal a- affections --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- +afflictions, and, ah, like -- and then rain and snow and just little temporary ones --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think it does affect your mood if you let it.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  You know, you can always get over it by, you know, d- doing the dog thing, going outside, exercising or just pushing yourself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to go out with people and usually by the time you start talking to them you're out of your little depression and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- not even worth seeing a doctor over.
L:  But it's still -- the fact is, is you- your -- I -- I agree.  Like, for me it's -- it's not so bad that I would see a doctor but at the same t- -- like, every other life cycle, like, sometimes your tired, sometimes your depressed, that other life stuff.  But, um 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like it happens and you have to proactively make it not happen.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  For me it -- it happens and I have to make it go away versus it's just something that doesn't affect me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  I think there's certain [SIGH] -- there's certain types of depression or certain types of illnesses that you can't [PAUSE]  that you -- that you can stay away from sort of.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, like, obviously if somebody has the flu stay away from them.  But, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this is something else that, like, it does come over a lot of people.  It comes over me.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I have a friend that's actually, ah, clinically depressed and is on medication for it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They say it's really hard during the winter and even with the medication it gets harder --
L:  Oh, really? [NOISE]
R:  -- to control it for them.
L:  Does he or she, like, get medicated all year round?
R:  Yes.  All year.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They're still trying to get over it.  Because every time they try and, like, wean themselves off of it, it just -- 'cause it treats the symptoms only, it doesn't treat the actual underlying cause.
L:  Right.
R:  So  they still do.
L:  Have you -- I've never read anything about the cause of it.
R:  It's -- it's all psychological really.  Whatever happens to be going on i- in your life at the time can cause you to be down and some people are predisposed to it even.
L:  Huh.
R:  I mean, m- my brother went through it but he didn't get medication or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anything.  And --
L:  Did he every do- [NOISE] --
R:  -- I have -- I have the genetics for it 'cause my mom always got depressed when she was young too, but for me it's a little different in how I deal with it.
L:  What do you do?
R:  Um, just think about things that are actually going on in your life that you should be happy for.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It sounds cheesy but it really does work 'cause when you're concentrating on just the flaws that's going on at your time, you know, of course, you get depressed.  It's easy for human beings to pick out flaws rather than the positive.
L:  That's true.
R:  Like, we get people that judge others or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- pick out this thing wrong, this thing wrong, this thing worse, I'm like, "But, you didn't look at this, this, this and this".
L:  Right.
R:  It's kinda, like, differences versus similarities.  There's a lot more similarities in people than there are differences.
L:  That's true.
R:  We just notice the differences.
L:  I was just talking about that at dinner with some friends 'cause -- I'm thirty three --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and somebody's fiftieth birthday, and we were just talking about the sense of maturity of what you're willing to say at different ages in your life, like, you know, your sense of self.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I know I was much more judgmental as a teenager and even into my twenties and now I'm like, "Oh, right.  I don't nee- --" [SIGH] first of all it's not nice to be judgmental and I don't need to be but, secondly, it's like now I know that everyone else goes through shit too, it's not just me so I don't need to project such nasty shit on people.
R:  Yes.  And now -- nowadays it seems like the generations are getting more and more self involved and self centered.  Is it just me, or am I -- are you seeing that too?
L:  [SIGH] I -- I don't know about generations, um -- I don't -- I don't -- wouldn't label it that way 'cause sometimes [PAUSE]  Yeah.  I don't kno- -- I don't really know about that, um, -- and, what are you -- are you saying that in youth or like, twenty year olds?
R:  Yeah.  'Cause -- I mean, I go to college and --
L:  Oh.  Where do you go- --
R:  Ah, Florida Gulf Coast.  It's in Fort Myers. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And in my college peer groups it seems, like, it's very few and far between that you find someone that's beyond the, ah, "me" stage.
L:  Are you a freshman sophomore or are you junior senior?
R:  Ah, junior.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, and it just ended.
R:  And most people I've encountered are just very --
L:  Me centered.
R:  Yeah.  They're just -- everything is, "What can you do for me?"
L:  I h- -- I really -- I have to say, I think, and I'm starting to accept that I wouldn't like it again if I were twenty in -- in that kind of a circle.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But because I'm not I see it and I think, "Oh, they're cute".  Sometimes I see that now, like, i- i- it sounds so silly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm ten years older, but I look and I go, "Oh, they're being cute".  'Cause I'm, like, I remember -- I think it's just an age thing, like, you're out of your par- parents -- parents house, in some level anyway --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] -- and you're -- you're kinda discovering yourself as an individual.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I actually kinda respect, at least as Americans, like, that's our cycle when you go through high school and you get out and go to college.  Like, it's an -- it's -- it's --
