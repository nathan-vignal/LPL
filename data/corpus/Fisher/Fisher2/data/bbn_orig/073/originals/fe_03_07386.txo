R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Joanne.
L:  I'm Heather.
R:  Hi, Heather.  This is my first call.
L:  Me too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they talked so fast I didn't hear all the topics that they said we were supposed to discuss [MN] -- discuss which was the worst ones. [NOISE]
L:  I know.  I think -- I think it was, like, smoking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- drinking excessively, overeating, not exercising.  There's something I missed.
R:  And gossip. [LAUGH]
L:  Gossip. [LAUGH]
R:  I kinda like the gossip one. [LAUGH] Because I don't --
L:  Yeah.  Really?
R:  -- think that's one [LAUGH] and unfortunately I'm guilty of overeating so that's probably [LAUGH] not mine.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  How about smoking? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Are you a smoker?
L:  No, I'm not.  And they'd -- actually just -- they just banned smoking in all bars and everything in Boston.
R:  Ah!  Is that where you're at?
L:  Yeah.  That's where I'm at.
R:  I'm in Indiana -- Indiana.
L:  Oh, cool.  Yeah, so they just -- they just banned smoking in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- restaurants and all bars in -- and it's such -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's so much more pleasant.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Right.
L:  Like, [LIPSMACK] you don't go home smelling like smoke and --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] They do that t- -- around here too but [MN] -- I think in bars if y- you're eating in bars you can still smoke but otherwise, you know, most restaurants have no smoking.
L:  Yeah.  Here, like, you go into a club, you go into a bar, you go into --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- anything no -- like, outs- -- you have to go outside to smoke now.
R:  Uh-huh.  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  It's really good 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you don't go home smelling like smoke.
R:  Right.
L:  And there's no, like, second hand smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No one blowing smoke in your face, no one burning you, no one -- it's so nice.
R:  And years ago -- I mean, y- you know, way back when, I used to smoke, so it's not that I'm totally against it, but I think, you know, they should just smoke at home or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think -- I think the, um -- I think there's nothing good about smoking. [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  Like, [NOISE] absolutely nothing.
R:  No, uh-uh.  Not -- n- n- -- I can't think of anything either.  And my -- unfortunately my daughter and her husband smoke and unf- -- they can't afford it and I can't get it through their heads, you know, that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're throwing all that money away on cigarettes that they could be using for the kids.  You know?
L:  Yeah.  What it's like, five six bucks a pack now?
R:  I d- -- I don't even though, but I think so, you know.  It's -- it's very -- I don't know if it's that high but it's -- maybe it is Boston, around here --
L:  Right.  In the city.
R:  -- I think it's probably about three dollars a pack or something like that.
L:  Oh.  In the city I know, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and in New York city --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's like -- like in -- it's somewhere around six I think.  And you could go to a, like, they used wh- when you could smoke in clubs -- you -- they'd sell cigarettes in the clubs and they sell a pack for, like, eight bucks.
R:  Ah, mhm.  Of course.
L:  Which is crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Like, it's a waste of money and it's terrible for you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like at least, like, drinking's -- like, there are some health benefits.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Not drinking excessively, that's also --
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  -- bad, but -- but there's nothing, like, there is no health benefit to smoking and it -- it doesn't only affect you it affects everyone around you. 
R:  Right.  That's what I worry about with my grand kids.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know that second hand smoke and stuff.  That -- that really bothers me, but I can't, you know, can't force them to quit so 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] That's -- my father in law always said when we smoked, he always said, "That's just one more nail you're putting in your coffin". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  No kidding.
R:  [LAUGH] That's what he always said.
L:  But -- I mean -- then again there are people who never smoked a day in their life and eat health and exercise and, you know -- 
R:  And get lung cancer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's --
L:  And there're -- there are smokers who live until hundred, so 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's -- d- -- there's just no rhyme nor reason is there?
L:  No.  But -- but still, I mean -- I still don't think that there's any reason to smoke.
R:  No.  Uh-uh.  I s- -- you know, 'cause when I started it wasn't -- it was cool to smoke back then.
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.
R:  You know everybody on TV smoked and stuff and that was before they found out that it's cancer causing and all this stuff.  And -- and now with all the education that the kids have I don't understand why they even start.
L:  Mhm.  I know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, I never have and I never will and --
R:  Well, that's good.  Right.  You're smart. [SIGH] And my son who's, ah, just graduated college, he's an athlete and so he's never smoked because he knows, you know, the damage it can do your -- do to your body so that's good for him.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm an ath- -- yeah, I'm an athlete too so it never even occurred to me to.  Where did your son go to school?
R:  [MN]
L:  Are we straying?
R:  Um, he went to college in Indiana.  It was Anderson University.  Ah, it's a sma- -- it was a small Christian school.  
L:  Oh.
R:  But actually one summer he worked near Boston.  In fact, he -- he worked at a Christian camp.  It was called Camp Good News.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Have you ever heard of that?
L:  No.  I actually grew up in New Jersey.  I went to college --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in Boston.
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  Mm.
R:  I was born in New Jersey. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I didn't live in New Jersey but I was born there.  I have a lot of relatives still there.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you're in Boston now?
L:  I'm in Boston now.
R:  'Cause you're in college?
L:  Um, no I graduated but --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- I -- I'm working now in Boston.
R:  Yeah.  Well, wherever he was he was close 'cause when the kids would come in they'd go to Boston to -- to pick up the -- the kids at the airport.  He was kinda like the designated driver. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then he went to -- they went to Boston whenever they had free time.  So, he --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he liked it.
L:  It's -- it's a big city.  It's a fun, young city.
R:  Yeah.  He liked the area.
L:  Yeah.  It's definitely a good area.  Um, so what else are we supposed to be talking about?
R:  Um, let's see  they said, ah, what -- what -- well, how about gossiping? [LAUGH] Are we supposed to gossip?
L:  I thought we were. [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH] That was one, and what else?  We s- -- the alcohol and --
L:  How overeating is -- which is -- which is worse for you, overeating or not exercising or something.
R:  Right, that's true.  Yeah.  I mean, I think we all tend to overeat and a lot of it, I think, has to do with restaurants too.  Everything is super size now.
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's obscene.  It's kind of disgusting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, we don't [NOISE] -- they say we don't really realize what a -- a regular serving is anymore because everything's gotten so much bigger.
L:  Yeah.  No, it's true.
R:  And so we all expect it to be bigger.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, like, a serving size of chicken is the palm of your hand.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  Which they probably serve, like, four in a restaurant.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And they serve like six ounces of pasta.  Like, I don't eat pasta.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, like, if you go to a restaurant and order, like, a pasta dish it's, like, six servings.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And people have no trouble, like, eating three quarters of it and --
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  -- thinking, like, "Oh well, I left some over".
R:  Oh.  And then all the bread too that goes with it.
L:  Mhm.  It's, like, okay the starter meal with the bread.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, four people will eat, like, two loaves of bread.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And -- and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then out comes, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a pasta dish which is, like, all pasta and nothing else and --
R:  Uh-huh.  All carbs.
L:  Mhm.  Yep.  And it's crazy.  It's, like, I don't -- yeah, I don't go out very much for dinner.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just because it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so expensive and it's all, you know -- I don't know.  It's like I'm supporting myself and I feel like I don't need to go out.
R:  Right.  And if you [NOISE] do want to go out, you go out for lunch and it's a lot cheaper.
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  We do that sometimes, my husband and I, on the weekends.  You know, we'll go out, um, you know, for lunch rather than [MN] dinner 'cause it's -- you get plenty of food and it's, like I said, it's a lot cheaper.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you go to a nice place.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] Yeah.  It's, like, sometimes I'll go out and, you know, have them box up half of it for me before they even serve it to me.  Just so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I won't even want to eat it and I'll have another meal.
R:  Well, that's a good idea.  You're smart to do that instead of trying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to force yourself to eat it.
L:  Yeah.  Or leave it over, like, at least, like -- 'cause, you know, if you got a big salad with chicken on top you tend to, like, eat the chicken and leave the lettuce.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if they separate it for you, it'll have, like, even parts of both and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you'll still have a -- a full meal.  And you'd be surprised, like, when you're done you're still not -- your not hungry when you're done when you eat half and, like --
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  Instead of, like, gorging yourself and being like so full you can't walk.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're, like, "Okay.  I ate, I'm full and I still have another meal".
R:  Yeah.  That's why I hate to go to buffets 'cause I always feel like I have to get my monies [NOISE] worth.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Today was, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in Boston they have this scooper bowl which is, like, seven dollars goes to the Jimmy fund which is like a cancer research fund [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and there's, like, thirty two different ice cream flavors that you could -- they give you, like, a scoop and you can try as many as you want.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I didn't -- I didn't make it 'cause I was too busy at work.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, like, last year there are people, like, football -- high school football players who were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, just kept stacking --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- their cups and had, like -- must have had, like, fifty cups, you know.  
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  They're having like -- like, they're like high school kids having contests, who can eat more.
R:  I'd be sick.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My co workers went and, like, I think last year one of the kids had, like, twenty eight.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  But, it's kind of -- kind of insane.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess so.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  So what kind of work do you do?
L:  I work in financial services.
R:  Oh, that sounds interesting.
L:  Yes, sorta. [LAUGH]  How about yourself?  What do you do?
R:  I'm a teaching assistant.
L:  Ooh.
R:  At an elementary school and I've done that for seventeen years now.
L:  Oh, wow.  My mom's a kindergarten teacher.
R:  Is she?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Our school is, ah, um, elementary middle school.  It's K. through eight.  But I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work with first and second graders.
L:  Yeah.  They're cute.
R:  Mhm.  They are.  But I'm glad to be off the summer. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I wish I had the summer off.  That would be so nice.  I should start teaching.  That would be excellent.
