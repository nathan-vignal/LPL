R:  Jim McCracken.
L:  Sally.
R:  Hm.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, how are you doing?
L:  I'm doing okay.  So, um, the topic is, I guess, which do you like best?  Eating at home or at a restaurant?
R:  Yes.  It's, uh, not very hard, I don't think.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um.
L:  [MN]
R:  I, uh, I definitely like going out to restaurants more.  It's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, less clean up, and I guess that's the main reason.  More variety. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You don't have to cook it.  [LAUGH]  So are you a participant in this or are you actually at the University or ...?
L:  No, I'm a participant and I'm not --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- at the --
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
L:  -- University of [LAUGH] Pennsylvania.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I didn't understand how that worked.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I guess mine would be at home because I don't cook, my boyfriend does.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And he's good at it.  
R:  Okay.  Well, I like going to restaurants because I have a two year old and a three year old and they, um, make clean up a mess so I like the re- -- the, uh, waitresses and --
L:  Yeah, I'm sure they do.
R:  -- waiters to have to do that.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Especially when there's ice cream involved.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um.
L:  So what is your ideal dinner?
R:  [SIGH]  I don't know.  I'm not very much of a gourmet person.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But, uh, you know, just a hamburger, a normal sandwich, or something like that would be fine.  I think my ideal dinner's probably gone down quite a bit since, um, since I started, you know, since we had a few kids.  
L:  Uh-huh,
R:  Um, because, I don't know, I guess, uh, just as long as I get food in and it's, uh, you know, everybody's happy and everything.  That's uh, that's the most important part.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, I don't really like -- I'm not really into anything fancy either.  I like, um, pizza a [LAUGH] lot.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah --
L:  And --
R:  -- um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] what -- where would you rather have pizza from?
L:  Um ...
R:  Of the different chains and things?
L:  I usually prefer Pizza Hut as far as the chains go.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I like, um, Papa John's probably the better, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um --
L:  I used to work there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but we didn't get that good a d- a discount so I didn't -- I never bought their pizza while --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I worked there.  
R:  Okay.  Um, yeah, I think that Papa John's is the best and I do normally get the extra sauce on there.  It makes it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a little bit better.  Dominoes, which is I got last night, uh, their pizzas just a little bit too dry.  I think.
L:  There's certain places --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- I would always avoid.  Like Dominoes is [LAUGH] one of them.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And Little Caesars.
R:  Yeah, they're the worst.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so is your boy- your boyfriend's a good cook.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  He doesn't usually make anything fancy, but like tortillas with beans and sauce and sour cream and cheese in them.  That's one of his favorite things to make.  
R:  Do you like dessert?
L:  Do I?
R:  Yes.  
L:  Yes.  +Maybe --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a little too much.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I like ice cream a lot.
R:  Yeah.  My, uh, my kids do as well.  I -- I -- I mean, I do.  I guess everybody likes the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- likes ice cream.  Um ...  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] where would you prefer to go out?  Any special restaurants?
L:  Um, not really.  There are some, like, restaurants that I like to go to.  There's, uh, a, um, Thai restaurant and there's also --
R:  Where -- where are you?  
L:  What?
R:  Um --  where you calling from?
L:  Oh, [MN] Montana.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, I'm in Richmond, Virginia.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yes, they actually do have those kinds of things in [LAUGH] Montana.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, my ...  Um, yeah, I -- I have, you know, as far as restaurants go, um, you know, I have a -- a hundred dollar gift certificate from Ruth Krist[?] that I have had sitting up in my, um, draw for over a year now.  I guess.  Just because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I never find the time to go there.  Like, I think I got it for Christmas like a year and a half ago.
L:  You got a gift certificate?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's, uh, you know, from my parents.  [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I might have got it for my birthday or for some -- my birthday or Christmas or something like.  So gift certificates for restaurants are pretty, you know, pretty easy.  You know, one size fits all kind of thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Has it been ten minutes?  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I don't think it [LAUGH] has been ten minutes because when the ten minutes is over they'll, like, tell you.  Like, at the end they say [MN], something, um, you -- the ten minutes is over, you have thirty seconds to say goodbye.  That's what --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- they say at the end.  
R:  Yeah, this is my first call.  How many ...?
L:  Um, this is my second.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  [several inaudible words].  I'm a veteran now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  It's, uh, it seems to be longer than it would [LAUGH] seem [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, it does seem longer than you would think.  Ten minutes is, like, when I'm getting ready in the morning ten minutes is like thirty seconds.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Now normally I would do this earlier in the day but it kind of just, um, you know, my day.
L:  Yeah.  So are there any kind of restaurants you would avoid?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I've never eaten any Indian food.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or anything like that.  Um ...  And I, typically, if I'm gonna go to a, like a Chinese +place or something like that.  I always eat like the same thing.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I don't, you know, I don't trust myself to eat [MN] very many different types of food like that.
L:  Sometimes I'm not sure of what to get when I go to those kinds of places because I don't know what will taste good, but I've become a little more adventurous since I became a vegetarian.
R:  Oh.
L:  Before that I --
R:  I -- I normally like --
L:  -- was the strictly the, you know, hamburgers and pizza kind a girl.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Um, how long have you been a vegetarian?
L:  Um, let's see.  I think four years.
R:  Oh, wow, that's a -- that's a while then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, uh, I normally, if I'm gonna get something, I get like the same thing and then I, you know, if somebody else gets something different then I'll try it.  That way I can maybe broaden my horizons without, you know, sacrificing a whole meal if I don't like it.  
L:  Yeah.  I w- I went to Russia -- I've been to Russia one time and when I was there because I was a vegetarian it was kind of hard sometimes because I only knew -- I didn't know all the words for the different kinds of meat.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I only knew like three different kinds of meat words.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I'd be like, "What's this word?" and my teacher would tell me that's something +like a mutton or something.   
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Whoops, don't want that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Yeah, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I couldn't imagine being a vegetarian.  I mean, you know, I mean there's nothing wrong with it.  I'd just -- it would be hard, you know, hard for me to do it. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  My kids definitely could do it pretty easy though.
L:  Yeah, I was a picky kid.  There was always like "I don't want this meat because it has fat on it" when my mom made pork chops.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I guess, you know, that's something --
L:  I never got really attached to meat.
R:  [MN]  I don't know.  It -- [MN] my kids are, you know, insist they don't like meat.  I don't know if that's normal for kids or not.
L:  I think it's normal --
R:  But --
L:  -- and then when they get older they'll like it better 'cause that's --
R:  I wonder if that [MN] --
L:  That's what --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- happened when I was little -- myself and my siblings.
R:  Right.  Um, you know, I wonder if vegetarians would say that's, um, you know, because you're not really supposed to eat meat.  
L:  I don't know because, like, some people -- I think it depends on the person.  Some people seem to get sick if they stop eating meat.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even if they're like getting protein or -- from other sources they still end up getting sick for some reason.  
R:  Um, so if you go to a Italian restaurant, what kind of food would you get?  Just pizza?
L:  Um, well, I like pasta sometimes.  I normally don't eat it at home but if I went to a restaurant that would be something I would order.  Like, I like to get lasagna sometimes 'cause I -- I only have it occasionally so it's a nice treat to have.  It's like a hard dish to [LAUGH] prepare so I can't ever see making it myself and ...
R:  So if you get [MN] -- if you had lasagna at home it would be either --
L:  It would be --
R:  Would it be --
L:  -- the microwave [LAUGH] kind.
R:  [LAUGH]  I think the Big [inaudible] with lasagna [LAUGH] is -- is not that bad.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, the big one, they have like twelve servings.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, my parents --
R:  Um --
L:  -- uh, actually sometimes get those.  
R:  Yeah, because, you know, it's, uh, I mean, it's not as g- good as homemade but it's, uh, it's much [LAUGH] easier to fix.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, and for as good as it is, I mean, I don't know, I couldn't waste all that time doing it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and that's, I don't know, for spaghetti I -- I make some meat and everything, but I don't do, you know, I don't go all out on that either.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's so, you know, I think it's tastes pretty good just, uh, just the way it is.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
