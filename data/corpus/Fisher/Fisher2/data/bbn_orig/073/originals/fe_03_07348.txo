R:  This is Forrest.
L:  Ah, this is Frank.
R:  Hi, Frank.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  The topic of the day is illness.  At what season do people get ill?
L:  No.  I think it said something -- people get ill when the seasons change.
R:  Oh.  They asked [MN] as far as how -- how do I know when I am getting ill, or how do I prevent from getting ill.  I try to exercise and -- and eat the right foods.  That's -- that's -- and get enough sleep.  I find when I don't sleep enough is when I get ill.
L:  Right.  And I find that most of the time that, ah, I start getting ill -- is not at the seasons change, but at daylight saving times changes, when I lose an hour of sleep.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  It takes me about three weeks to get used to it, and during that whole period of time I'm kind of, like, tired, groggy, run down, [NOISE] nose runs.
R:  You know what?  I didn't ever think about that, but that's about the same time that I start getting sick in the -- in the summer and the fall.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or the spring and the fall.  Well, that's interesting 'cause, ah -- you know, my allergies are seasonal and they -- they last about two weeks in the spring and two weeks in the fall.  Ah, mostly like right now when the cottonwood is flying everywhere is when -- when I'm hurting.  But, it's also during that time when I'm not getting enough sleep.
L:  [NOISE] When the cottonwood is flying?
R:  Yeah.  We have cottonwood here in Oklahoma, and it's -- it is --
L:  Oh, you're in Oklahoma?
R:  -- it flies everywhere.  Ah, like, any given day it'll look like, ah, a snow storm 'cause there's so much cottonwood flying around during this time of the year.  During -- during -- usually it ends in May, but this year it's been unseasonably cool so it kept on going.
L:  [LAUGH] And see, here -- here on the east coast we just have things like lilacs and cherry trees and [MN] no big deal.
R:  Really?  So, you guys don't have real bad allergies out there?
L:  Ah, yeah.  We're -- we're having them this year.  But, because the -- it's been cold and damp it's -- ah, according to my doctor at any rate -- it's caused the, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, all the pollinating trees to -- to jam up because it hasn't been warm enough for them to come into season gradually.
R:  Oh, okay. And that makes it last longer, doesn't it?
L:  Well, yeah.  And what they're saying -- ah, what my doctor is telling me is that -- not only that, but it's, like, all of a sudden in three weeks we're getting two months worth of pollen flying through the air.
R:  And that's what is happening here too because it's, like, ea- -- like, normally the rains will stop in april and they'll be light in May, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they'll be sporadic in June, and they won't -- ah, be any in July.  We've been having floods every da- -- every weekend.  Every weekend it rains, you know, two or three inches.
L:  You sure you're not living in Philadelphia?
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  I don't know.  It feels like the -- you know, I've lived in Oklahoma all my life and it seems like the seasons change.  And people are getting more ill because the seasons -- like, today it's hot.  Yesterday it was raining.  And I think no one gets used to that because it changes every day.
L:  You are living in Philadelphia.  We're having --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- exactly the same weather.
R:  Exactly.
L:  We've had five inches of rain since the beginning of June. [PAUSE] 
R:  And I feel like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's -- again, that's why people get ill because their body never gets used to it, um, 'cause it, you --
L:  I don't --
R:  --know, you never --
L: -- know.
R:  -- know what's going on.  My body never -- like, yesterday it was cold -- needed a jacket.  Today --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I wore a long sleeved shirt -- I'm sweating to death.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's -- I mean, I -- I'm in the kitchen right now and it's hot as blazes --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- as they say.  Um, have you done this stuff before?  I know this --
R:  This is the --
L:  -- off --
R:  -- very frist --
L:  -- topic --
R:  -- call I've ever done.
L:  Hey, welcome to the club.  It's the --
R:  It's -- very frist --
L:  -- first one I've --
R:  -- they called --
L: -- -- done.
R:  -- me a couple of times.  They catch me -- I put time -- five o'clock as my time 'cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I get off work.  And they call at five o'clock.  And so, it normally takes me calling back in because I'm normally walking out of the office.  They don't allow cell phones in the office.
L:  Oh, of course not.
R:  And that's another thing.  The other day a girl got strep throat in the office.  Um, about two weeks ago.  And since then twenty people have gotten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it.  You know --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- 'cause she do- -- she didn't wash her hands properly or whatever, you know.  Or she came to work when she's got a fever.  And that's --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- another thing.
L:  Um, and that's what we do here.  I work in a high rise.  And, ah, you know, every -- every fall when -- when the colds and flu season starts the off- -- ah, the whole building gets sick.
R:  And they just keep passing it around.  I have four kids, so we -- we pass it around enough our- ourselves.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes. [NOISE] [MN]
R:  And they --
L:  Well --
R:  -- ask me if I'm trying to start a soccer team 'cause I have so many kids.
L:  Well, you're gonna need a few more if you really wanna soccer team.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, there's indoor soccer here in Oklahoma that's, ah, six on six.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I got, ah, the right amount, but the -- the one year old he doesn't play goalie very well.
L:  He doesn't?  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You can't just lie him there and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- let him do it?  Well, I -- [MN] we're supposed to be talking about getting ill and what we do to prevent it, I guess.  Um, exercise, eat right, all the things that you said at the beginning.
R:  Do you, ah -- do you, um -- do -- I mean, everybody always talks about their eight hours sleep.  Do you get eight hours sleep every night?
L:  Um, no.
R:  Yeah, me neither.  I'm lucky if I get six. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, I try real hard to get seven.
R:  Yeah, I feel like --
L:  But --
R:  -- I'm ran down a lot.  People say -- you know, I can tell when I've had a rough week and -- and that my immune system's getting low because people say, "Are you okay?  Do you feel right?"  And then, I'm one of those type of people that when I start getting ill you can see it.  There's no doubt --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- that I'm getting ill.
L:  Well --
R:  I don't hide --
L:  -- I mean, I --
R:  -- it well. [LAUGH] 
L:  You don't?
R:  Not at all.
L:  You get that bleary eyed look?
R:  I get glassy eyed.  My --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- I get bags under my eyes.  I even start -- I'm still -- I'm thirty two, so I'm still, you know, relatively young.  And I -- I'll break out -- out on my face.  And people are, like, "Well, you're getting sick".  Yeah, I've been working same[?] place five years so they -- everybody knows when I'm getting sick there.  I'll walk in and they'll say, "Oh.  Forrest's getting sick". 
L:  Well, I tell you.  I'm sixty one.  And, ah, when things get real tense -- I mean, in my life -- I start breaking out.
R:  And getting sick?
L:  And getting sick.  And, you know, the doctor -- ah, the doctor tells me that, you know, "Hey, clam down, relax.  That's why your hi- -- that's why you have a pimple this week".  You know --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- that sort of thing.
R:  I get cold sores real easy when I'm starting to get --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- sick too.
L:  -- that's a bad sign.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  And I've given it to -- you know, it's -- it's something you have to -- you -- you -- it -- cold sores are something you give.  So, my -- all of my kids get 'em.  And they're, like "Thank you, Dad".  My twelve year old's, like, "Why do I get cold sores?"  I said, "'Cause I get 'em".  And he says, "Thanks".
L:  Gets cold sores when he gets run down, and it's -- it's --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- ah --
R:  and it breaks out in the -- like, in one child it breaks on his cheek.  My --
L:  Really?
R:  -- wife, it breaks out on her nose.  Me, it breaks out on my lip.  My son it breaks up on his -- his upper lip.  It breaks out on my lower lip.  Ah, so each one of us is just whatever the spot's the weakest is when it, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Mine's always --
R:  -- does [inaudible].
L:  -- at the corner of my mouth.
R:  Oh, those hurt the worst 'cause you've gotta -- when you smile or grin or anything it hurts.  What do you do for those?  Do you -- ah, do you use --
L:   Me?
R:  -- any --
L:  I use Campho-Phenique.  That's it.
R:  Campho-Phenique. 'Cause that drives them out, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah.  And it, you know, smells good, and --
R:  When I for- -- when I first start feeling one I put -- they -- they -- the doctor gave me some Zovirax to put on 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- as soon as I start feeling that I put the Zovirax on it.  That's helped a lot.
L:  Yeah.  I -- the only time -- I mean, the only time I ever really get them is I -- you know, if I'm really run down or if I'm running a fever.
R:  Mine's only from stress.  Like you said, we're all -- I'm the --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- collection industry, so stress is never, ah, a rare commodity.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]  The collection industry?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Wow.
R:  I collect, um, large debts for American Express.  And, um, you need -- [MN] it's a stressful environment bec- -- when you got goals.  I mean -- and that's -- and that's another thing that causes people to get sick.  And I think certain seasons people are more stressed.  Right now the stress is down 'cause people know at five o'clock when they go home it's not gonna be dark.  They can still do something.  Like, now, I'm gonna go play basketball --
L:  Right.      
R:  -- ah, to get my exercise in.  I know I can go play basketball.  I know it's not gonna be dark.  I know it's not cold as a well digger's rear.  And I can go out there and -- and -- and play basketball, and I'm gonna get my exercise.  And when I sleep tonight I'm gonna sleep a little more sound.  So, I'm not so stressed.  Ah, you know, back in the winter -- when I get off in the winter I feel like I've been beat up.  I feel like I got in a car wreck I've been beat up so bad.  And I get -- that's when I get my -- that's when I get the sickest.
L:  Mhm.  S.A.D.S. -- Seasonal Affective Disorder.
R:  Yeah.  I've never heard it called that, but that sounds right.
L:  You know, a lack of light makes people depressed and --
R:  Yeah.  I heard that about the Alaskan people 'cause that time that it's real dark --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that they get real depressed, and suicides are up, and -- and people are sick all the time, and ill.  I couldn't imagine it.
L:  I couldn't either.  I mean, I have a hard enough time, you know, dealing with what -- seven hours of daylight, or with hours of daylight during the year -- winter.
R:  During the, ah, winter.  Yeah.  That would be tough.  What are you -- are -- are -- you work in a high rise, so you're not outside all the time.
L:  No -- no.
R:  No, me ei- -- me neither.  I -- so, I guess I wouldn't know what it'd be like for someone who has to be outside all the time and, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, I know the construction workers here they work year round --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, the ones that do the, ah -- build homes and stuff.
L:  Right. 
R:  They -- they work year round and -- and they -- they try to set up enough jobs that even on the bad days they'll have some indoor stuff to do.  And y- you can tell those guys.  Those guys are always sick because they're in the cold, out of the cold, in the cold, out of the cold.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Then --
R:  That's how it was for me in the milit- --
