L:  Hello? [NOISE]
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  It's Gretchen.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, Gretchen.  Hi I'm Rita.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  [NOISE] I'm good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How're you doing? [NOISE]
L:  Good. [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  So, do you live where you get [SIGH] ill a lot when your seasons change, or do -- do you live where the seasons change? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, yeah, sort of, in North Carolina.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Well, I'm farther north in New York and we ge- -- of course get all the -- probably a little bit more drastic season change than you do.  But 
R:  Yeah.  Well I -- I've lived most of my life in Massachusetts, [NOISE] so 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  We, um -- I -- I myself don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really get sick very often but my husband does, ah --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- when the seasons change, and my kids do.  Um, I've got fifteen month old twins and [NOISE] they, of course, this year are having their first time to be outside [NOISE] when the weather's nice, and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a couple of times we've had them out early spring and they got colds and then the colds turn into ear infections and [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Ooh. [LAUGH]
L:  So, [NOISE] we've had the run around with that, but [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] --
R:  No.
L:  How about yourself?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, I don't get sick all that much.  N- not really, but [NOISE] usually, just in case, I [MN] always, um, just e- -- do things like eat -- eat garlic and [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- th- th- things that keep, you know, your --
L:  Do you just eat it raw?
R:  Um --
L:  Or do you cook it?  Or how do you ?
R:  [MN] Well, it's -- it's not as effective when it's cooked.  I'll take, like, garlic pills or --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- or, I'll, um, you know, add some raw to food, like, cut up.  Yeah.  
L:  Huh.
R:  Garlic is --
L:  How does that -- it -- um [LIPSMACK] -- do you take it as a preventive thing or do you, like, if you first feel, like, the symptoms of cold or something, is that when you take it? [NOISE]
R:  Um, mostly I take it as a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- preventive thing but, um, if I feel like I'm gonna get a cold --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sometimes I'll eat garlic, but if it's -- if you want garlic to help you at that point you have to eat the whole lot of it and that's kinda difficult to do. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause then you smell like it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, if you taste of garlic. [NOISE]
R:  What was that?
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  Oh.  Hello? [PAUSE]
L:  And I think sometimes people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- say that when they, um -- I don't know if it's when they've taken the pills or if when they  [inaudible] [NOISE] about your garlic breath if you have the pills?
R:  Um, no, not really.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, 'cause it's -- or it's in powder form so it's not as strong first of all and, you know, you just take it -- well, I -- I take them in gel cups so it doesn't really affect my breath at all.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  I've never really tried any of [NOISE] the, like, natural type things.  I usually -- wel- -- I mean, other -- I mean, as far as, like, [NOISE] herbs or different remedies, like  [inaudible] [PAUSE] 
R:  Oh.  Hello?  I can't hear you. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Things like, um, going to s- -- you know, getting more sleep and [NOISE] drinking lots of water and things like that.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  But  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, are you on a cell phone?
L:  No- [inaudible] [NOISE]
R:  No.  I can't hear you very well right now for some reason. [LAUGH] [SIGH] You keep clicking out. [NOISE]
L:  The connection is -- connection is pretty bad, yeah.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  But  I'm on a handheld --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- but it's -- [MN] usually it's fine. 
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  So  
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
L:  Can you hear me now?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Because it does --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- kinda keep going in and out.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  But, ah 
L:  [NOISE] But, um, yeah, let me think.  Um, in the fall sometimes I'll get a -- a little bit of a cold but it never lasts very long.  It's usually, you know, because I -- I'm usually out enjoying the weather but it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's [NOISE] just for a little while and, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, end up getting a little bit of a sniffle.  But, if I get enough sleep and drink enough water and, um, then it usually, you know, goes away.  I don't usually get too much of a problem.  But, [SIGH] um  Do you guys --
R:  Mhm?
L:  -- have -- you -- you probably don't have much [NOISE] of a winter down there do you?  
R:  Um, not that much.  It did get kind of cold.  But, I don't know --
L:  You probably don't have a whole lot of --
R:  -- I'm not -- I don't deal well with the cold anyway.  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, I got pretty sick this winter actually.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Now, do you have air conditioning?
R:  What was that?
L:  Do you have air conditioning?
R:  No.  No. [LAUGH]
L:  I know som- some people, um. [LIPSMACK] like, my husband used to say that when he lived in Arkansas that, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because of the air conditioning [NOISE] sometimes he would get sick because they -- they'd go in where it was really cold and then sometime go out where it -- that, you know, where it is really warm [NOISE] and just the temperature change itself would be enough to make somebody g- get sick.  So 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if that was the cause of it with me, but when I would live with my mother I would get sick when she had the air conditioner on.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I felt like I couldn't breath well and my throat would kind of close up a bit and, I'm not sure if th- they could change the quality of the air, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if was just the temperature change, I'm not sure.
L:  Or allergies or something?  Do you have allergies, at all?
R:  No.  I don't have allergies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, that's another thing that makes it hard to tell as far as, you know, what -- what's -- the -- you know, i- if you're getting sick because of allergies or is it, you know, with the change of seasons or if it's because of something else, you know or 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I've always had a pretty good immune system.  My mom's a school nurse and so, w- when I was little she'd always bring home the germs. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I think we just kinda got exposed to it that way and never really, um, [SIGH] [MN] really got sick.  You know we kinda built up an immune system because we were exposed to so much, but, [LIPSMACK] um, and that's kind of carried through as an adult too.  I don't -- quite often I think I carry germs but I don't -- I don't actually get sick myself.  So 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, um --
R:  Yeah.  That must be the case with.  I don't really ever get sick.  Maybe once a year and sometimes not even that much. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  I know my --
R:  Mm?
L:  -- husband had a hard time when he changed from, um, he moved from Arkansas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to here in New York where the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- climate was so different, that first winter he just -- he was sick a lot, like, all the time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It seemed like he would -- if there was any colds going around he got sick and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it would last a while.  But then after that first winter he kinda got ac- acclimated and, um, I guess, you know, after that -- after that introductory period he was i- -- he was fine.  And, um, now he just gets it every once in a while.  But, [SIGH] I think there, ah, definitely is something to do with the climate changes and [LIPSMACK] things like that, so   But 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  How about anyone in your family, d- do they have any problems --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting sick or ?
R:  Um, no, not usually.  O- -- um, my boyfriend actually had a similar thing like your husband.  He's from Georgia and he, um, h- he spent this winter in the Wisconsin -- in Northern Wisconsin where --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Wow.
R:  -- it's -- it- it had gotten to, like, thirty below at night sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  That's a big change. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  He, ah, [MN] he didn't enjoy that very much, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  And did he -- did he -- so he got sick more often then?
R:  Yeah.  He doesn't usually get sick very much but he did a bit this winter.
L:  Huh.
R:  Mm.  But, he got used to it after a little while.  I think there was a study done somewhere that determined that after three weeks anyone from any climate can get used to the cold.
L:  Huh.
R:  Like.  Be acclimated to it.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  And, then you kind of build up a resistance probably, after that.  
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You're body gets used to it.  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  I've had friends living in houses that had, like, no heat and they would be walking around in T. shirts in the winter in Massachusetts.
L:  Ha.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
L:  Wow.  So they just -- yeah, they jus- --  yeah.  Other people could do the same thing and they'd be sick before you know it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.  It -- I've never understood, like, yeah, there is a whole bunch of research out there too as far as if you get sick because you're not dressed properly or if it's something else.  You know, like, some people go out in the early spring or in the fall and they're not dressed, you know, like, they're in a T. shirt or whatever and they get sick afterwards and I've heard controversy about whether that actually causes them to be sick or if it's something else.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  But 
R:  I'm not sure about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] No.  Um, [SIGH] so, this -- wha- what was the thing that th- th- they said afterwards for the last -- 
L:  The quo -- I --
R:  -- topic, you know?
L:  I didn't catch the quote.  Is that what you're talking about?  
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some- -- I didn't catch that. [LAUGH]
R:  Um 
L:  But, what about --
R:  I'm -- I -- I didn't think I heard it right.  What was that?
L:  -- what abo- -- what about the -- it's a different saying than what they mentioned but, um, [LIPSMACK] what is it?  Feed a fever and starve a cold, or -- or was it the other way around?  Have you ever heard of that one?
R:  No.  I haven't.
L:  Starve a cold and feed a fever.
R:  Starve a cold and feed a fever.
L:  I don't know.  We were just talking about it the other night because my son has an ear infection right now and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he has -- had a fever and there's some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's, like, an old wives tale about if you're supposed to, you know, if you have a fever or if you- -- [MN] but I can't remember if you're supposed to star- -- you know, if you're not supposed to eat very much, you're supposed to just drink or -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I forget I can't remember.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With that one, but --
R:  You could probably say, maybe, like, when you have a cold not eating is probably better 'cause -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I've done some, ah, research on fasting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, it, like, it's good for things like that because, um, it lets, like, your body rest from digestion and focus on the things that -- like other things that it needs to do like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- maybe getting rid of a virus or something.  So 
L:  Yeah.  It kinda flushes your system probably?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, fasting including, like, drinking though -- probably right?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely --
L:  Or is that --
R:  -- dri- drinking -- drinking water at least.
L:  Yeah.  Like clear fluids, like, yeah --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And, then just not eating anything.  Mm.
R:  Mm.  It's pretty -- 
L:  Yeah.  Probably -- 
R:  -- good actually.
L:  -- probably flushes your body of all the toxins and stuff.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It usually does that first and then --
L:  I wonder, have you hea- -- is there any research out there where if you do that every so often that you won't get sick?  I mea- -- is there -- have you ever heard anything like that?
R:  Um, no I haven't heard anything ab- --
