R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.  Ah, my name's Paul.
R:  My name is Bobby.
L:  Okay, Bobby.  Let's see, our subject is supposed to be about, ah --
R:  Illness.
L:  -- illness.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, ah -- ah, how -- what we do to treat it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, what we do if it goes on for about a week.  And what we do then at that period of time.  Is that correct?
R:  That's correct.  I also think we should think may- maybe about how the weather affects illness too, like, through --
L:  Like [MN] --
R:  -- [MN] grey and cloudy, and ugly and rainy, and how it affects people's moods and, um, things like that.
L:  [MN] Moon beams and thi- [LAUGH] 
R:  What?
L:  The moonbeams at night.
R:  It may mean moonbeams at night too, but I think mainly -- um, I know when the weather is ugly I think you can get a sinus infection.  If it's -- it's, like, rainy -- we've had tonnes and tonnes and tonnes of rains here and -- are you from the east or -- where are you from?
L:  Ah, let's see, ah, [several inaudible words] -- I'm in -- okay, this is pretty good -- northern Illinois.
R:  Northern Illinois?
L:  Ah, the Chicago area -- the outer suburbs.
R:  I'm from Pittsburgh, and we've had tremendous amount of rain, rain, rain -- ugly grey days. And myself and my friend -- I remember my friends do get sinus infections when it rains like this.  And also, I think it affects your moods.  The -- the grayness and the ugliness affects your moods.  You can't go out and exercise as much, and do things like that. So, I think that's all part of, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, being ill.
L:  Well, I agree with you there, ah, because when it rains, or even if it gets just dark and gloomy outside, like, prior to it, ah, raining, I get this, like, depressed feeling over myself and, ah, a listlessness.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, ah, you sa- -- you don't have the same, ah, feeling as when it's all bright and shiny outside.
R:  With the same energy --
L:  And you --
R:  -- to do all --
L:  -- say, "Oh, let's --" [MN] you -- you go, "Let's be adventurous and go here and go ther and go that".  So, you're kind of a little bit down in the dumps.  And then --
R:  I'm glad --
L:  -- when the --
R:  -- it's not hormonal.  I'm glad it's not just women.  I'm -- I'm glad men experience the same -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the same things.
L:  Well, unless -- unle- unless I'm going through male menopause at this [inaudible] all my life.
R:  That's a -- that's a possiblity.  That -- that's a real possibility.  But, it is true.  I think that, you know, this past winter has been very, very dark and a lot of people were really sick.  I had that viral infection that I got.  And I had it for, like, almost three months.  And part of it was we went to Atlantic City and we were there, um, [LIPSMACK] over the Valentine's Day weekend.  And the smoke in the casinos made me sick and exacerbated the -- the viral infection that I had.  So, instead of being sick January, February and March, you know, it continued for a really long time.  And after, like, a week I went to the doctor and I got antibiotics.  And I don't like to take any sort of medication at all.  But, I was on antibiotics from -- two to three different kinds of antibiotics for, like, two months.  And, ah, it was really a pain.  But, I think it was affected -- 'cause the weather was so bad -- bad -- bad winter.  So, do you take antibiotics if you get sick?  Or if you're -- you're sick for more than a week do you got to the doctor?
L:  Well, I've been on a prescription medication since I was thirteen years old, and I'm in my forties now.  Yeah.  I have epilepsy.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  So, um, it r- -- things affect me a lot more than other people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, because I'm cons- constantly thinking of it, ah, because my doctor's constantly asking these questions when I was a -- small and I was going there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he was asking me, "How do you feel about this?" and "How do you feel about that?"  And he would ch- -- you know, he was also at the same time right next door to my, ah -- won't say -- dread -- general practitioner at the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I would go there for my examinations. [LIPSMACK]  And when I went there -- and came there he would say, "Doctor So and So said what about this, and how about that?  And do you feel a little bit -- ah, how'd you feel about that?"  And I would say, "Well, I have a cold now".  And -- and when I have a cold -- every time I have a cold I real flu.  It'll -- well, it'd occur to me is that I would a epileptic seizure.  Because, what happens is that when you get a cold all your fluids run out of your body.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And as a result of that the medication that I was on -- the -- for stabilization, ah, would be depleted with in the bloodstream.  And he was always asking about this, so that he would run a particular series of tests on me to find out if I had the correct amount of, ah, medication in my bloodstream.  And if I got a cold or whatever he wanted to know what type of medicines I had on.  So, I always -- ah, or was on at the particular time.  So, if I had -- I was co- -- I had a cold or a flu and it was -- it lasted more than, ah, let's say three days --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would automatically go over to the doctor.  And when I went to the doctor whatever medication he decided to put me on at the time I would go on that particular medication, then go next door and tell the other doctor that I was on that particular medication.
R: And the pharmacists always check to make sure that the medication is fine, don't they?  They -- they always make sure that, um, the medications are always in sync.  Because, like, I have an uncle who has Parkinson's and, um -- actually I just came from -- we just came from [inaudible] -- and one of my very close friends has Parkinson's too, and one of her medications wasn't kicking in.  But, the interesting thing was that neither one of them -- this past winter as bad as it was here, and I know it was bad -- probably bad in Chicago too -- neither one of them got sick with the flu.  They have been so heavily medicated that the medication, um, stops them from actually, um, getting a lot of the -- the viruses and things like that that can happen to people who are, um, not on a lot of medication.  Do you find that happens to you at all?  Being medicated, ah, with the epilepsy does that stop you from getting colds or viruses as often as would stop some of --
L:  No, I --
R:  -- your friends?
L:  I think it actually -- what it does is it -- um, because of being on the medication and all that, ah, your body's naturally trying to fight that, even though it -- the medication's there to help you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm a little bit more prone to catching a cold or a flu, because it seems like I'm the first one to get it in the household always.  Oh -- and in comparison to everybody else -- and as my -- like, my wife, she's a postal worker -- and she delivers letters and she's outside all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she doesn't get sick as often as I do, and I'm in a office environment. 
R:  But, don't you think office environments -- sometimes there are a lot of germs in -- in more offices.  [MN] I'm a -- I'm a retired principal -- I retired really early.  And we were in an open space school, and people in the school were always sick because they didn't get fresh air.  So, I think fresh air and clean air really helps people, um, much better than [inaudible] than being in an office.  But, I mean, I --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh -- oh -- well, ah --
R:  Would you rather be in an --
L:  My -- my particular office area wouldn't be as congested as a school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, this is -- I don't know if yours was, ah, basically a adult environment, or if it was, ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- consisted of, ah, children [MN] within a certain age category.
R:  Middle school students, and about a hundred [inaudible] teachers.
L:  Okay.  Walking diseases -- walking little diseases.
R:  But, yeah --
L:  Kids that doesn't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.
R:  But, you know what's very interesting?  The children who were the cleanest were the ones who were sick the most often.  The children who -- hygienic habits -- were not as clean were children -- did not get ill as often, or for as longer period of time.  A lot of the kids had asthma, which, um, is becoming much more prevalent now.  And they couldn't go out.  We had to make special arrangements with the kids who had asthma.  Some of the kids had, ah, allergies to peanuts, and we -- ah, you know, we had to be very careful that they didn't [inaudible] a peanut or a peanut product.
L:  Ah, do you know --
R:  But --
L:  -- my -- excuse me, I don't want to interrupt you while --
R:  Go on.
L:  -- speaking but, ah, my son -- ah, when he was younger they told us that he had asthma.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, and that he would have to be on this medication for, like, ever.  Ah, what happened?  We took him to another doctor -- took him to the other doctor.  We didn't mention anything to him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the other doctor didn't say anything about any type of asthmas, right?  And then -- and mentioned it to him a little further down the line as we were going to the doctor.  And the doctor says he didn't need this medication.
R:  Hm.
L: And my doctor would've ended up being on it. And, ah, to this particular day -- my son's up in his twenties -- and it probably would have caused serious damage to his, ah, health.  And, ah, the doctor that I was seeing at the time  -- when we took him to him -- to the second doctor he said that a lot of doctors when they're not too sure of something about the child --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, can -- during their period when get -- might get -- be getting an allergy, they automatically pin this asthma onto it.  It was, like, a thing they were going through.  Doctors have a -- kids have asthma -- asthma -- asthma.  So, they're giving out these little inhalers all the time to the kids.
R:  I got one. [NOISE]  They ga- -- they -- I -- I had Advair -- it's some kind of an inhaler.  I've never had it in my life.  But, because I had the viral infection and, like, bronchitis really bad this winter they gave two -- um, Advair and something else, ah, in a -- in a purple -- um, [LIPSMACK] a spray like -- and, um, I use it minimally.  But, I was sick for more than seven days.  Like, th- this study says, if you're sick for more than seven days I think they tend to prescribe many more antibiotics than you should take, many more, um, asthma inhalers.  And I do think that it's good to get a second opinion, especially with kids it's real important to do that.  Um, what other kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] effect do you have from the weather and from, um, just colds in general and things like that?
L:  Ah, other than your basic flus --
R:  Mhm  
L:  -- and the, ah, mood swings --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- which are hard to, ah, calculate because of the type of medication I'm on?  I don't know if it's the mood swing due to the medication or to the weather but, ah, my wife says that, ah, between the two, ah, it's not on a consistent basis --
