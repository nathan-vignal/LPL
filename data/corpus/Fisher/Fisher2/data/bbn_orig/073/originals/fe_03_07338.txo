R:  Hello.  My name is Hannah.
L:  Hi there.  My name is Josh.
R:  Hi, Josh.
L:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.  Um, did you hear the last part of that topic?
L:  [LAUGH] No.  My girlfriend asked me --
R:  [LAUGH] I totally --
L:  -- a question --
R:  -- missed that.
L:  -- so I missed it as well.  I -- I suppose we just ignore that.  Hopefully they won't mind too much.
R:  Yeah.  Something about the doctor.
L:  About the doctor was it?
R:  Yeah.  Do -- do we agree --
L:  I think we should --
R:  -- like --
L:  -- just determine that we agree and let it go at that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  Right.  How do you deal with getting ill in the winter?
L:  You know, I really don't get ill in the winter very much.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I feel more tired, but that's about it.  But, I do --
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  I did go out last winter and buy some full spectrum bulbs for a, like florescent light, so that really helped a lot.  That --
R:  Hm?
L: -- was probably it.
R:  Oh, I can't hear you.  Hold on.
L:  Oh, oopsy.
R:  Sorry.
L:  All right.
R:  [MN]
L:  I [NOISE] -- I went out last winter and purchased, um, like, a full spectrum light and that pretty much did away with every sort of, ah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- uncomfortableness with the fact that everything was dark.
R:  Interesting.
L:  [NOISE] How 'bout you?
R:  Um, well, I was not really able to afford one of those lights.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But no, I was kind of thinking of it.  I have this weird globe that lights up.
L:  That's cool.
R:  It's very arty.  I kind of have that in my room.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that works okay.  I don't know.  I got kind of sick, um, just, you know, physically sick.
L:  You just felt --
R:  So --
L:  -- like crap because it was winter, or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I see.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  I can understand --
R:  -- like, you --
L:  -- that.
R:  -- know, when you get an actual physical illness.
L:  Mhm.  I know people who are like that.  They're all tired all winter and such.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know that I really do that too much.  But then, I stay inside most of the time anyway, so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't like the sun.  It is my enemy.
R:  Yeah.  I'm going to college in Ohio so, it's like, crap out there in the winter.
L:  I understand.  I am just west of you -- Indiana.  So, it's --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- it's pretty ugly.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [MN] 
R:  But it's -- I'm not used to it entirely, but --
L:  Mhm.  Well, where --
R:  I'm originally --
L:  -- where are you --
R:  -- from Philadelphia, so it's grey there too.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, Ohio's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- kind of famous for [inaudible].
L:  Well, not only is Ohio famous for that, but Ohio is, as far as I can tell, boring as hell, not that Indiana's --
R:  Well --
L:  -- any better.  Don't get me wrong.
R:  Yeah, my college is kind of interesting that way.
L:  Which one are you in?
R:  Um, it's Oberlin.  It's big and [inaudible].
L:  Oh, Oberlin.  Yeah I -- I know some people in Oberlin.  Yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's really cool.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's like, Oberlin is supposed to be fun by itself.
L:  Well, it's supposed to be, like, this -- what I've heard is a serious activist college, where everybody's real crazy and liberal. 
R:  Well --
L:  I don't know if it's actually the case or not.
R:  And then people get, like, serious about not being serious as well.  Kind of --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- wacky.
L:  I encountered that.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in, ah, various anarchist publications.  Wow.
R:  Actually, ah, um, the activism I think that it's almost -- my -- my friend, who's, like, in a college which is not known for much action[?] is actually much more involved than I am.  I --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- think it might have to with the environment, like, where if everyone is doing it, it's like, a little more threatening.
L:  I can --
R:  Or if there's --
L:  -- see that.
R:  -- like, these structures in place.  Anyway --
L:  'Til they -- so, they band together.
R:  I guess, you know, I -- I think -- about this phone study what I think is that they might be testing us on something completely different -- is my suspicion.
L:  Ah, I -- I suspect that as well, but then I kind of enjoy trying to outwit psychologists.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Occasionally I succeed, although they usually get me.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Although, do you remember any of the rest of the original topic at all?
R:  Um, well yeah, like, how do you deal with being sick?  And there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, the -- the really sad voice said something about, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- oh, it -- it was the last part.  I swear, I kind of remember I heard, like, doctor -- do you agree  --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- with people going to the doctor -- I -- I don't know.
L:  But see, we're going -- let's -- let's assume that they mean do you agree with people going to the doctor because they feel sick in the winter.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  That seems reasonable.
R:  Yeah.  I think so too.  I mean --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I pulled, like, some hypochondriac stuff last summer, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that was, like, pretty unrelated.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, people do what they want.  Doctor gets paid either way.  People feel better.  Whatever.  Like, I -- I know --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- some people who are --
R:  As long as --
L:  -- total --
R:  -- people --
L:  -- hypochondriacs.
R:  -- aren't either, like -- either way about the doctor -- like, not enough reasonable -- going to the doctor, or too much going to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the doctor.  I think that there's a balance to be struck.
L:  Oh, definitely.  Like I said, I just don't go to the doctor unless I can't walk or something.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it's cheaper --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- that way.
R:  I got myself to the doctor this year.  I was very proud.
L:  Very nice -- very --
R:  I got --
L:  -- nice.
R:  -- like, a prescription for a sinus infection.  I was, like, "All right".
L:  That must have been nice.  I guess I did go for bronchitis a couple -- a couple of years ago.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  But, that --
R:  That's what I found.
L:  -- just went away.  So, yeah.
R:  At least I've never gotten, like, strep throat or something --
L:  Oh God.
R:  -- which probably means that I'm about to get it, like, in two seconds.
L:  Yeah.  You'll suddenly just be struck dead in a couple of years and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like, "I wish I had of been sick".
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  These things --
R:  -- like a big --
L:  -- balance out.
R:  -- thundercloud.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  All your illness has been building up.
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean, I think I get sick enough, but I'm not, like, worried --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- either way.  A normal amount of sickness.
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure -- not really sure it works that way anyway, the idea that sicknesses build up.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  It'd be very --
R:  -- just like a -- that's more superstitious.
L:  Yeah.  It'd be --
R:  That's like a feeling --
L:  -- a very strange --
R:  -- of how it --
L:  -- reality.
R:  -- should work.
L:  Mhm. [COUGH]  If everything were fair, but we've seen evidence that in fact everything is not fair.
R:  Pretty much.
L:  Yeah.  I can live with that.
R:  Yeah.  I took some interesting biology seminar, where -- oh, we read some book about, you know, the evolutionary benefits of sickness.  So, I can --
L:  Evolutionary --
R:  -- remember, like --
L:  -- benefits?
R:  Hm?
L:  They -- in -- in that they kill the weak you mean?
R:  Well, no.  Um, it's like, it's much more complicated than that.  I just can't remember any of it.  Yeah, um, well, the fact that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- when you're exposed to germs when you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very young --
L:  Oh [MN].
R:  -- exact- -- like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there was something like that.  But, it was -- it was very interesting.  I wish I could remember.  I bet I could go find the book.
L:  I'm sure -- not sure we have time for that.  But --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- was it something --
R:  I just -- [MN] I just, like, kind of moved my stuff [NOISE] so I actually have all my books basically, like, out in a box.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  Anyway.
L:  I had -- I had all of my belongings in a storage area up until, like, a week ago.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It was fun.  But, ah --
R:  Yeah.  I just definitely have this thing about arranging my crap.
L:  Mhm.  I don't so much arrange it as kind of leave it lying around and hope that it'll arrange itself. 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Just for a new look, but, you know, you have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to repeat an experiment to try and get results, right?
R:  [LAUGH] Right, yeah.  Um, mm, I don't know where it is.
L:  That's all right.
R:  Just forget that.  But, it's -- it's really interesting.
L:  Mm.
R:  This is why I care this much about talking about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause the theory was so cool.  I don't know.
L:  Do you remember if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it applied to individuals, or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to the species as a whole?
R:  Basically to the species as whole.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, you know, also -- also I think it's -- it's about the interaction between the two.
L:  Mhm.  See --
R:  Mm.  I think that there was also -- I don't know -- I just feel like the reaction against sickness, like, you have to counterbalance it as far as possible is a really bad idea.
L:  I would tend to agree with you there.
R:  Yeah.  Because I don't -- people, like, don't realise the capacity to just deform the balance of things, which sounds very Oberlin I know, but --
L:  Yeah.  I'm not sure if there is such a thing as a balance of things.  But I -- I --
R:  Well, I think there is --
L:  -- can believe in --
R:  -- kind of a --
L:  -- certain --
R:  -- general --
L:  -- homeostasis.
R:  Hm?
L:  I -- I can believe in a certain homeostasis, but it is a balance of things which is that -- ah, people usually use the rhetoric of things being right or wrong, and they're striking such a balance.  No, you're not --
R:  Well --
L:  -- meaning such a law of balance.
R:  Well, I think -- well, what do you mean by a stasis?
L:  [COUGH] Um --
R:  I mean, just kind of, like, a general --
L:  Things -- it's not so much a stasis.  I -- I'm alluding to the -- the idea of a balance, but the idea that things eventually come back into a certain overly static -- no, not an overly -- ah, overall a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- static situation.
R:  Right. Like --
L:  Um --
R:  -- when sometimes, you know, it balances out whether it's at one time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- either way.  It might be a one way sometimes -- one way the other time.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, in terms of the whole thing --
L:  Yeah, more or less.
R:  Yeah, it's more --
L:  More or less.
R:  -- or less around a certain point.  So, is that what -- philosophy?
L:  Is that --
R:  Or is that a science thing?
L:  You know, I don't know.  I generally throw pretty much all philosophy out the window because it tends to be based on presumptions that I don't necessarily agree with.
R:  Right. That's interesting.
L:  But, ah --
R:  It's like, it's kind of -- philosophy -- I don't know.  [MN] I don't know why I would trust science more.  That seems equally dumb.
L:  Well, except for the science you can observe things.  I don't know.  Science -- mathematics make more sense to [several inaudible words] then I'm an English major, so I don't know what I'm talking about here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I'm planning --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on taking, like, one science course.
L:  Mhm.  I just got --
R:  But --
L:  -- I took a bunch of math -- ah, college level math in high school and just got so fucking tired --
R:  Oh, where --
L:  -- of it.  It was --
R:  -- are you --
L:  -- just --
R: -- -- going to school?
L:  I'm at I.U. at the moment.
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah, I'll --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- be done -- I'll be done after the summer.
R:  Is that the book that -- um, oh the Jane smiley book was based on?  Or was that a different college?
L:  I'm sorry.  The which book?
R:  It was Jane Smiley.  It's called Moo -- about, like, an agricultural college.
L:  Is it --
R:  But, I think that she based part of it on a larger university.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I did not know that.  I've never encountered the book.
R:  Oh, it's --
L:  But, it's --
R:  -- a good --
L:  -- entirely --
R:  -- book.
L:  -- possible.  The university itself is fairly wretched, to be honest.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Ah --
R:  I think --
L:  -- if you --
R: -- -- a lot of people end up hating where they're at a little.
L:  Yeah.  Als- -- I don't know.  If you go out and make the effort it can be great.  But, I didn't feel like it, so I just didn't like the college.
R:  Yeah.  How long have we been on the phone?
L:  I have no idea.  Are we supposed to keep track of that?
R:  Um, I think they cut -- I don't know if they cut in or not.
L:  See, I was under the impression that they would cut in -- I can ask my girlfriend -- she's right here.  I was under the impression they cut in and that we could, like, review our ideas or something about what --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- gone.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Hold just a second.  Do you know how long I've been on the phone?  Have you -- have you completed a call yet?  Do they cut in? [NOISE]  Oh, okay.  Thanks.  Yeah, they end up cutting in at some point she says.
R:  Oh, okay. Cool.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hey, if you wanna really screw up the recording -- can I talk to her?
L:  [LAUGH] Oh God.  I'm not sure I'd get paid.
R:  Yeah, all right.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think they would probably just drop the call.
L:  They'd --
R:  Oh well.
L:  -- probably be pissed.  Yeah, I think we've already done enough damage -- what with not remembering what they were asking us to talk about.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, what's her major?
L:  Ah, she is in psychology.
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  Yeah.  She's crazy about it too.  She kind of, like, get done in threes years --
R:  Cool. 
L:  -- then go to grad school, and be making, like, a hundred K while I'm working, you know, in a ditch somewhere.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, English.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- what -- you know, directing what I would be studying in terms of getting paid for it.  I don't know.  Like, um, there's some laboratory work in the summers, but that pays nothing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Does psychology work really pay that much?
L:  Ah, once you get your PhD it pays mad cash.
R: Ah.
L:  Yeah.  Counsellors make --
R:  Wow --
L:  -- good money.
R:  -- a PhD.  Ye- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, yeah --
R:  That's at the end of a certain road there.
L:  Mhm.  What were you studying again?
R:  Um, I don't know yet.  I'm just finished my first year.  But Oberlin's just, like, "Da na da", you know, no course requirements.
L:  [LAUGH]
