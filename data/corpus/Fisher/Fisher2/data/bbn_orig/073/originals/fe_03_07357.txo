R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name is Ruth, I live in Maryland.
L:  Hi Ruth.  Ruth?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, hi.  Sorry.  My name's Larry.  I'm in Illinois.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Around Chicago, fairly close.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah I used to live in Illinois.  I grew up outside of Chicago, in Northbrook.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, sure, I go there quite a bit.  I'm surprised, this is my first call.  I just signed up today. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well this is my third call.
L:  Is it really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um --
L:  My friends did it before, too.  An easy way to make ten dollars, I guess, but --
R:  Yes, it is.  Yeah.
L:  I'm surprised they called so quick. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, let's see.  Our topic is illnesses.  Um, they were talking about the seasons changing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if you get sick, um, I really don't.
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny, I don't either. [LAUGH] I was thinking about that before.
R:  I do take some things though, to maintain my health I take a multi vitamin every day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I take a calcium supplement because I'm a little bit older, um, you know, so I do some things to maintain my daily health.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, but you know, as the seasons change, I don't really get sick.
L:  I'm basically the same way.  I take a multi vitamin and I drink a lot of orange juice, you know, vitamin C.  I almost never get a cold.
R:  Right.  No, I also drink orange juice almost every day.
L:  I do too.
R:  Um --
L:  I happen to like it, so instead of soda I'd rather have orange juice or lemonade or something like that.
R:  Right.  And I also drink a lot of water, so ah, you know, I think that helps keep your system, um, you know, clean and clear and whatever --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, just keeps you generally healthy.  Um, let's see, they also asked about um, you know, do you believe ah, I forget exactly what the question was.  Do you believe about a cold lasting seven days.
L:  Oh, right.  Yes.
R:  Um, ah, I really -- I really don't know, you know, obviously I've had some colds [LAUGH] and sometimes they last longer than that, it depends upon what is involved in the cold.
L:  Yeah.  I think the worst ones are the kids from school, because one kid catches it, gives it to everybody else, and it just keeps going around.
R:  Well, that's absolutely true, ah, it's hard to get rid of out of a confined situation like that.  Ah, but, you know, personally, you know, nah, I think a cold can last seven days, for sure if --
L:  Oh yeah.  And it also goes through the whole cycle, you know, sniffles and congestion and everything else.  At least seven days, probably.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  Do you have any kids?
R:  Um, well I have three grown children.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, ah, you know, they're comp- -- completely on their own.  And they were generally very healthy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, so, you know, it kind of runs in our family that, you know, we don't get sick that often.
L:  People are funny, they think the change in the weather, if it gets cold and they go outside, but they can't catch a cold from the weather.  It's -- there's no germs in the snow.
R:  Well that's true.  I think they're thinking more of, um, like, you know, if -- if you're not wearing the proper clothing, if you get wet, um, you know, and we have all four seasons here in Maryland, as you do in Illinois --
L:  Uh-huh, right.
R:  -- but it really didn't affect my children that much, I mean, I made them dress properly according to the season, um, so --
L:  Yeah, nowadays you go from the house to the car, to, you know, school, and, you know, they're not outdoors that much unless they're playing, and if they're dressed properly they're not going to get sick.
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  So --
R:  Um, I'm trying to think what else they asked, ah, gosh --
L:  How's your weather out in Maryland right now?
R:  Ah, raining at this moment. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  We're just getting a brief thunderstorm, you know, blowing through the area.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, you know, otherwise it's been fairly nice.
L:  We've had it fairly cool so far, it's starting to warm up a little bit now.
R:  Oh yeah, we've had a very cool spring and very wet spring.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Had twice as much rain during the month of May as normal.
L:  Oh, wow, making up for last year, though.
R:  Ah, definitely, definitely.
L:  Yeah, same thing here, it was real dry last year, so it evens out probably.
R:  Yeah, well even -- even that goofy season, you know, weather, did not -- I don't -- didn't affect my health at all, ah, you know, I don't -- I'm not -- I'm out in the rain, but you know, occasionally but, you know, it didn't really have any affect on -- on me.
L:  Mm.  Do you work for a living, or are you a housewife?
R:  Um, I just got laid off, um, at the end of March --
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  -- so I'm currently not working.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um, you know, that's fine.
L:  That's a good way to catch a cold too, from the office.  If you work in an office --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- somebody gets a cold and they sneeze on you, or you know, you're -- you're handling the telephone that they handled or --
R:  Right, that's -- that's absolutely true.  The -- the germs spread widely in offices, and ah, you know, I -- I've been around people who had colds and, you know, you want to wipe your phone if they're using it --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- and keyboard, and stuff like that --
L:  Yeah, some people don't have that much manners.  They sneeze wherever they want to without covering themselves and, I have people sneeze right at me. [LAUGH] 
R:  Sure, yeah, no, that's true and you know, you just need to do whatever's necessary to protect yourself, so, um --
L:  I hope you get back to work soon.  It's supposed to be getting better with the economy, but I wonder [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, yeah.  It would be good. [LAUGH] Ah, but it's fine, it's a nice time of year to be off work, so, you know, I'm not -- I'm not that worried, ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it'll eventually turn around.
L:  Yeah. [COUGH] Excuse me.  I like spring time about the best.  That, and autumn.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  So, it's -- so --
R:  Do you do anything else, um, to prevent getting sick?  Do you have kids?
L:  Um, not really. [COUGH] Excuse me.   I've got a dry cough.  Ah, I just take vitamins, like I said, and I very seldom get colds.
R:  Mhm.  Do you have kids?
L:  Ah, yeah.  Three of 'em.
R:  Uh-huh.  Young?
L:  Oh, both.  In fact my daughter's birthday is today, twenty four --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then from five years old to ten.
R:  Wow, okay.
L:  Sorry, I got it wrong, twenty five. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  I mean, do your kids bring home germs?
L:  Yeah, for the most part.  But they keep it to themselves.  Ah nobody else gets sick from them, surprisingly.
R:  Well, that's very good.
L:  Yeah.  We're all pretty healthy.  Which is good, it's cheaper that way too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  With the cost of everything.
R:  Well, you know, plus, you know, if you take your kids to the doctor and -- and give 'em all the shots and everything, you know, they pick up less illness.
L:  Right.  We got good insurance, so we do a lot of preventative stuff, you know, first sign of something they all pop like, pills and --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  You can, you know --
L:  So --
R:  -- I know my -- gave 'em juice, extra juice, um, you know, that type of thing.
L:  Which is what they like, too, so it's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [COUGH] excuse me.  Oh, so you're all done with your, ah, job for them, huh?  They give you three phone calls?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's the limit?
R:  Ah, yes.  Unless you sign up where you have extra phones --
L:  I noticed that, yeah.
R:  -- and I have a cell phone, but, you know, the connection is not always that good.  I would not want to be speaking to someone on my cell phone. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah, you know, because it's -- the connection is kind of iffy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, --
L:  Do you have to have a different number?  Init- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I saw it, I didn't quite understand it though, but --
R:  Ah, yeah, so --
L:  I think I'll stick to the three and get it over with.
R:  Yeah, no, three -- three phone calls is fine.
L:  Uh-huh.  Do you use the internet a lot?
R:  Ah, yes I do.  Every day.
L:  Okay.  I guess I do too.  I ah, really like it.  I've only been on a computer about three years, but I get a big kick out of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you do surveys also?
R:  Yes, I do. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  Do you have call waiting?
L:  Ah, yes I do.
R:  Oh, okay, 'cause it sounded like it -- it interrupted for a second there.
L:  It didn't sound like it though, it was like a beep.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Oh, anyway.  Yeah, I'm sort of big on surveys now too.
R:  Yeah, well I do a lot of surveys, ah --
L:  Greenfield?
R:  Ah, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] They finally started paying.  I got a check yesterday.
R:  Oh, okay, and I do NPDOR --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and um, oh --
L:  NFO is pretty good.
R:  Yes, I do NFO, yes.  NFO's very good only you don't get a lot of surveys from them.
L:  I know.  You ever do Baron?  It used to be real good.
R:  No, I've never even heard it.
L:  Jonathan Baron?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was a weekly thing, ah, on Thursdays at, ah, eleven o'clock central.  It was three dollars, usually, or four, but it was every week without fail.
R:  Oh, no I've never even heard of it.  I do Harris, though.  The Harris poll.
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm working for a DVD for my kids on him. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm pretty close to it.
R:  So --
L:  I get a kick out 'em.
R:  Yeah, well, I'm trying to think if there was anything else regarding the sickness that we need to discuss, ah, to stay on the topic.  Um, yeah, I mean, I just don't get sick.
L:  They picked the two wrong people 'cause we never get colds.
R:  Ah, yeah.  No, and I do everything to prevent getting colds, so, ah --
L:  Do you get a flu shot every year?
R:  Ah, no, I don't.  But I've never gotten the flu, never been that sick.  Um --
L:  I used to, but I've skipped this year and nothing happened.  You know, they talked about it, this and that, and I never got around to getting it and, you know, like I said, nothing happened also.
R:  Yeah, I -- I didn't hear of it being like a big flu season, either.  So, at least, not around here.  Ah, but nah, as long as I'm fairly healthy, you know, then I can skip the flu shots.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't like shots that much to begin with.
L:  Yeah, I don't either [LAUGH] In fact, they give you part of the virus, what they do, so you -- you could get a, you know, some after effects from it.  Everybody's different.
R:  Right.  And it's supposed to build up antibodies.
L:  Uh-huh.  I guess it changes every year.  It sort of migrates into a different
