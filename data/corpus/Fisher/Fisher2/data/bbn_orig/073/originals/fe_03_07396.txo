R:  Hi, my name is Owen.
L:  Hi, my name is Dana.
R:  Hi Dana.
L:  Hi.  This is my first time doing this kind of call.
R:  It's my second. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Okay.  Well --
R:  You just really just kinda talk that's all.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's not, no -- I don't know if I got everything they said though.  Gossip, overeating, smoking, drinking.  Was there another one?
L:  Drinking alcohol or caffeine excessively.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Overeating or not exercising.
R:  That's right.  Not exercising.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] 
R:  What do you think is worse?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, I have a tie.  Um, I think -- for my personal opinion, gossiping or, um, [NOISE] drinking alcohol excessively. [NOISE] Um, I've had some people in my family that have had problems with alcohol so I think -- and I see what it's done to people so that's why I think that. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I agree with the alcohol that I think, um, [LIPSMACK] alcohol is a really bad personal habit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I -- I don't think -- gossip isn't really that -- I don't like gossiping.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it seems --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like everybody does it to a certain extent, even like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even, like, within families, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] I know that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, as --
R:  I --
L:  -- soon as we get done with the family get together I always call my sister and we kinda just review everything that was [LAUGH] done at the family [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  And I -- I think what -- I think what makes gossip good or bad is if you're willing to say -- admit to you said something.  
L:  Oh, okay.  That's maybe, where I've seen a lot of problems.  But, the -- to get back to the alcohol, um, [SIGH] my -- one of my sisters was in a -- she is a alcoholic.  She was in a drunk driving accident.  She's really wreaked her whole life.  She's lost her husband, she lost her car, she lost her license, had to claim bankruptcy and all of this because she, um, chose to drink and drive.  So, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's why I -- I just know and I've s- -- and then we have other family members who have, um, you know, had alcohol problems and I just see that it's just the root of evil.  I believe.  So 
R:  I -- yeah.  I agree with you.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I agree with you but I -- I also think that, um, not exercising is bad too 'cause we're, like, all -- most people are, like, so lazy. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, I know I was gonna s- -- I think that's one's bad too. [LAUGH]  Um, we can all exercise -- we all should exercise.  And I just think that there hasn't been enough emphasis put on that, like, at schools and things.  They've cut back on the gym, um, days around here.  Some people -- in fact, my son is getting ready to go to middle school and he will not have gym but for nine weeks of the year and I think that is bad.  I mean, kids need to get [MN] -- get active.
R:  That's true.  Well, my son didn't, um [NOISE] -- he was like a chubby kid --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like in middle school.  But as soon as he got into high school and you know, high school has more sports orientated things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then he just -- it just came off.  You know, he started playing football and all --
L:  Oh, that's good. [NOISE]
R:  -- that stuff.  But, um, yeah, I think it's [SIGH] -- I think it's drinking and gossiping -- I mean, drinking and, ah, not --
L:  Not exercising.
R:  -- exercising, but smoking is a bad thing too, but I'm an ex smoker so --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- people say ex smokers are always the most judgmental.  
L:  [SIGH] Well, [LAUGH] my husband is a smoker and [NOISE] I have asked him to stop and -- I mean it's a bit issue with us [NOISE] but it's -- he has tried and I applaud you for being able to quit.  It's -- it's got a hold on him and -- [SIGH] and it's scary what it can do to you.
R:  I know.  It --
L:  You know, we were just talking about it the other day.
R:  It's very hard to quit.
L:  Yeah.  How did you quit?
R:  [LAUGH] Just cold turkey. [LAUGH]
L:  Cold turkey.  He tried that and then he tried the patch.  The patch worked for a while and then he just went back to it.  [SIGH] Unfortunately, he, um, had -- has smoked since he was, mm, probably fourteen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He would steal cigarettes from his dad and -- 'cause we have three kids and I don't want them to smoke but they say kids of smokers are more apt to smoke so [several inaudible words] --
R:  Yeah.  My parents smoked.
L:  Did they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, you -- it's just really hard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but you have to, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when you quit, you have to find something that, um -- will help you to quit.  You know, you can't just quit something.  You have to do things that, you know, kinda take the --
L:  Oh, [MN] another activity or something.
R: -- place of it.  Yeah.  And a lot --
L:  What did you do?
R:  Huh?
L:  What did you choose?
R:  Well, actually I gained thirty pounds. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But my doctor said he'd rather see me gain thirty pounds than be a smoker.
L:  Right.
R:  But I did little things like, um, I tried to put a cigarette in my mouth without smoking it.
L:  Oh.
R:  That didn't work.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But what I did was -- this is really kinda funny and I was in a car --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- driving and I was trying to use the fake cigarette philosophy. 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean not cigarette but fake smoking.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And it wasn't working so I, um, what's different about this picture than in reality?  And then I thought, "Oh, I know.  The cigarette isn't getting any smaller".  You know?
L:  Ah. [LAUGH]
R:  So I, like, took a drag and tore off a piece off and threw it out the window.  You know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- took a drag, tore a piece off and threw.  Do you know I never had to do that again?
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  It actually worked.
L:  Mm.  I might have to tell that to my husband.
R:  Yeah.  It --
L:  I'd love for him to -- to stop smoking and it's such a money sucker right now.  They just keep raising the prices and it makes it hard, [SIGH] but ... [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, and then they always have the benefit, like the -- not the benefit but the incentive to smoke, like they give you prizes and free packs and buy one get one free and I [NOISE] -- we take advantage of those so it's --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- probably bad.
R:  Yeah.  I think what the ultimate thing is with any personal habit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean, you choose your habits what you're gonna do or not do --
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, that's -- that could be a good thing or a bad thing but what I think what makes any of these bad is if you, you know, go out and do them, you know, around other people and they don't like it.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  You know, like if -- if a person, like you said, doesn't like gossiping, they don't wanna hear what you have to say.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]  Yeah.  There -- it's hard not to gossip in a o- -- I just started a job and it is hard to listen to people gossip and not join in.  Because you're then the outside person.  And I think that's why I might have said gossiping because I felt guilty [LAUGH] about, [SIGH] you know, spreading a little bit of gossip at work this week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I feel guilty but I don't think I said -- I didn't say anything that wasn't true, I just [LAUGH] --
R:  I know what you mean.
L:  I said things that m- -- that were true and [NOISE] about my supervisor, and just as a way to get -- to vent it out and then they confirmed that they had the same problems.  So, I hope that we don't get in trouble for this. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  Well, and, like, overeating -- I mean, isn't that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- depends on your standards.  I mean -- [NOISE] I mean some people only eat a little bit and some people eat a lot.  I mean, if you sit there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and binge eat that's a different story but I don't think that's what they mean by overeating.
L:  I'm not sure what they mean by overeating.  I know that, like, gluttony is one of the seven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sins or whatever.  But, [SIGH] I mean, I think all of us probably -- um, you know, a great majority of Americans overeat because everything is so big [NOISE] sized now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- super sized everything --
R:  And buffets.
L:  -- the buffets.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just out of control.  It wasn't like that when I, you know -- there wasn't this many restaurants and -- [SIGH] and, um, I'm not sure where you live, but we live in Indianapolis and, um --
R:  I've been there.
L:  -- they [LAUGH] -- they said that, um, we -- we have more fast food restaurants -- if you can imagine this -- than the l- -- the normal or the average, um, [LIPSMACK] city of th- -- of our same size.  So we have more overweight people and just to go into McDonalds or something like that the -- the meal -- the -- they've got the big kids meal now and I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just more grease and, you know, bad stuff for us but I -- and there are more -- we were at a parade and I was looking at, like, the marching band and there were a lot of overweight children [SIGH] in the marching band.  And I just don't remember that when I was young and I just have to attribute that to the way they sell us food on to us.  And if -- and if you, um, notice, like, a lot of the coupons from out of paper and stuff it's for -- it's for junk food.  They have, um, all kinds of promotions.  They're all on, like, candy bars and buy Hershey candy bars and get a free t shirt or, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- movie tickets or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever, and it's all on the junk food. [LAUGH]  You don't see anybody, "Buy ten pounds of strawberries and get a free movie ticket".  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's -- it's not like that, they've always hyping the junk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we fall into it too.  I'm not preaching, I'm just observing.  You know, we can all, in our house, stand to lose a few pounds, I'm sure.
R:  Oh, I know I can stand it.
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I already know --
