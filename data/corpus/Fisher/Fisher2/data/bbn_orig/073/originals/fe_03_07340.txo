R:  Hello
L:  Hi [LAUGH].
R:  Hi, I'm Emily.
L:  Um, I'm Arleen, ah, I live in Polkato[?], Idaho, where do you live?
R:  Oh, I'm in Ph- Philadelphia.
L:  Oh Philadelphia, okay, do you get um, sick it -- when the seasons change?
R:  No, I don't get sick when seasons change -- I notice it like, I get sick in more or less headaches and migraines when just the weather changes, like when -- this year it's been raining a lot, so when it goes from like raining to all of a sudden like eighty five degrees I gotta say, then I feel like sick --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but not necessarily when seasons -- 'cause it's less drastic.
L:  Do you have allergies?
R:  No, no I don't -- I've never experienced allergies.  How about you?
L:  Well, I get, yeah, I get allergies, so change of seasons, like um in the spring, summer [LAUGH], right now with everything in bloom, yeah -- I -- I have a hard time with that.  But, um, like f- -- going into fall I don't, or winter I don't, don't know, I don't get any changes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like that, so -- do you have, you have regular migraines?
R:  Um, only like when -- not like very strong ones, but usually when the weather changes like if all of a sudden it's nice weather and all of a sudden it starts raining --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then [inaudible] I'll have like a migraine or a really bad headache.
L:  And, do you miss work?  Are -- are you --
R:  No, not usually, no.
L:  That's good -- so you can just --
R:  It's, it's, it's not that bad -- it's just like when the weather changes like for an hour or two you just, you know, you just kinda like get into a bad mood and you just feel really sick and your head hurts and -- I just take a medicine and get over it.
L:  Get over it.  Wow, that's great, that's great -- well, do you get sick very often for, you know, any other ...?
R:  Um, no, not really, I -- I'm not one that likes to go to the doctor much, so I try to avoid getting sick, and if I am sick I'll you know, I won't admit it and won't notice it.
L:  Do you catch things easily from other people?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, I guess I try to put my -- I don't put myself at that risk as much and I try to -- not to deal with people that are sick at the time, so I guess to that extent, no.  How 'bout you?
L:  Well I um, worked at a daycare for several years --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- and every time kids would get sick, I would get sick.  No matter how well I took care of myself, it was just like, kids hug you and, and kiss you and you know [LAUGH] sneeze on you, so I would pick up things, um, but I try to be healthy, I try to um, exercise and eat right and, um, and then when I do get sick I try to stay, you know, stay home and stay away from people, um, you know, 'til I -- 'til I feel better, but -- what do you do when you don't feel well -- other than um like, have a headache -- when you get really -- do you ever get the stomach flu, bad stomach flu?
R:  Yeah, I mean, I just go get pharmacy medication, like Mylanta or something, I -- I never actually make it out -- or unless it's really, really bad I never make it out to the doctor or anywhere, you know, f- for -- to figure out what exactly is wrong with me.  Usually I take some medicine for up to a week and then it goes away.
L:  Mhm, yeah, me too -- no I don't usually go the doctor for any little thing, no.  What -- what was the last question they asked?
R:  Something about, ah, I'm not sure -- something about a week versus um, seven days, but I -- I wasn't sure if I understood the question correctly.
L: Yeah, I didn't either -- I -- I couldn't understand what they were, what they were asking -- um [LIPSMACK], do you think a lot of people are -- they get sick when they're -- what is it, psychosomatic --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like when they're really upset, when they're um, feeling depressed, do you think people get sick?
R:  I mean, I think they might feel sick, I don't think they necessarily get you know, like sick, like have a flu.
L:  Mhm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but do you think like, um, ho, hypochondriacs -- do you think that's for real or do you think that's just -- they, they feel it, but it's not real?
R:  I mean, I think they feel it and they just more or less imagine -- I mean I -- I'm -- to me, like the idea of when you're sick it is you're coughing and you're sneezing and you have a fever, but ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- otherwise um, I mean, you're not really like sick, 'cause I look at it like if you have a cold -- when I think sick I think of a cold, or I think of a flu --
L:  Mhm, yeah, me too.
R:  -- not anything else -- so ...
L:  Um, I went to an herb lady for a while, um, because I was just sick all the time and she got me on herbs for various things and, and I got feeling lots better after that, but she told me that probably I would never end up with a, um, nervous breakdown or you know, anything like that because I would just get sick, 'cause my body was telling me, you've gone too hard, you know, you need a rest -- you're um, you know, you're upset over a lot of things, you just, you just need to take some time -- so your body makes you sick [MN].
R:  Oh really? That doesn't happen to a lot of people, 'cause obviously a lot of people do have nervous breakdowns.
L:  Yeah, yeah, well --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- and maybe that's a form of hypochondria, I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  What does that depend on though, whether you get -- your body gets sick or not, do you know?  [inaudible]
L:  Um, I don't know, I -- when I don't get a lot of sleep I know if I go for days and days and don't get a lot of sleep, then I'll get -- end up um, feeling sick -- um, or if I'm not eating right, if I'm not exercising --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I'll end up picking up, just picking up -- I pick up germs really easy from other people, so ...
R:  Oh, well, I guess [inaudible] -- isn't it that you get more germs from kids than [inaudible] from adults in general [inaudible]?
L:  Oh yeah, well yeah because you're, you're touching them [LAUGH] -- and you don't do that with a lot of people.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  That's true too.
L:  They -- they say like in big crowds -- you should stay away from big crowds if you're susceptible, because you -- 
R:  -- [NOISE]
L:  -- can just pick up germs through the air -- people sneeze and um, you know, if you shake hands with people --
R:  You wash your hands.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, you think th- -- and some people don't shake hands, 'cause they, they don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- want to catch anything.
R:  But I guess it's -- that's, that's disrespectful [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well, I know people think it is, yeah [LAUGH] -- but like in, in um China right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the SARS and, and, and Canada -- parts of Canada, um, you know maybe if we end up with all kinds of things like that going around, maybe we'll have to change our ways -- we won't be able to shake hands with people.
R:  Providing everyone -- I mean, you have to shake hands and then, um, you wash your hands -- I mean just don't touch your face with it and then you'll be fine.
L:  Yeah, right, but sometimes you forget, you know, you might have shaken hands with somebody and then you forget and you, you know, you touch your face -- you, you just get busy and [LIPSMACK] you forget about the germs then.
R:   Yeah, but I mean, I guess for how long can a cold last?  Like, mine never last more than -- at the most five days.
L:  Mhm, yeah, right, me too, yeah.
R:  [MN] I -- I mean it's -- and it's not, you know, if it's just a plain simple cold that you're catching it's not that bad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it doesn't usually keep me out of work, or out of -- doing anything else that I would otherwise be doing really -- unless it's really bad.
L:  No, I usually, no I usually don't get colds that are that bad, no, but I um, know -- I have a friend who has to go to work, she can't miss -- even if she has a bad cold, she just wears a mask over her face, which I think would be really, really miserable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can you imagine trying to work -- well, I suppose the people in, in -- that are wearing the masks right now in SAR- -- you know, the SARS masks, I imagine they feel the same way.
R:  Yeah, probably, but I mean, I guess that they're just feeling like they're facing a tougher situation -- it's more understandable, like other people understand why they're doing what they're doing, well -- versus -- if you see an average person at your workplace like that, you know [several inaudible words] trying not to get sick --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not, it's not the same [LAUGH] -- you, you think of them -- you think of them very badly probably, or you think they're weird.
L:  Yeah, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, and I guess a lot of the germs are just passed on because people don't wash hands.
R:  I mean, I don't kn- -- I'm originally from Ukraine and -- it is just more customary, you just come -- before you come to the dinner table you wash your hands, and in the US people like drive around, they do run errands and they enter a restaurant, and nobody goes to wash their hands, and it's kind of like they've touched a lot of things during their day, and, none of them actually like -- it's not like everybody gets up and goes to the bathroom to wash their hands [inaudible].
L:  Well, fast food restaurants too, drive, drive throughs --
R:  [several inaudible words] drive throughs and it's kind of like, to some extent -- it's like, it's customary they don't wash their hands -- how often is it that employees at restaurants wash their hands?
L:  [MN] Yeah, I wonder about that.
R:  [MN]
L:  If they scratch their head, or they, you know, they touch their face [LAUGH] -- yeah, oh, I've never thought about that.
R:  Yeah, but you could -- even if you go into the bathroom restroom I mean, it always says like, "Don't forget to wash your hands if you're an employee" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I guess you know, once you get used to that sign how often are you going to be able to wash your hands anyways -- how likely are you going to be?
L:  That's true, and even if you do go the bathroom and then you go out the door, out the bathroom door, you're touching a handle that maybe other people have touched and you don't know how many germs --
R:  Who didn't wash their hands.  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I know, they're just -- germs are everywhere.
R:  And it's, al- also when you're flushing the toilet, a lot of people you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, you know, they go to the bathroom and they flush the toilet, and then they don't wash their hands --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and other people have touched that at the same time.
L:  I know, yeah [LIPSMACK].  Well, how -- so, are you -- were you born -- you were born in the Ukraine?
R:  Yes, I was born in the Ukraine.
L:  And, how long have you been here?
R:  Um, I've been here twelve years.
L:  Twelve years?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Were you -- were you grown when you came over here?
R:  Um, no, no, no, I was young [MN].
L:  Okay, well, yeah, I guess because you speak so well [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- yeah, I just wonder if, if people over there are healthier than us?
R:  Um, I -- I don't -- I think it's just they're, I mean they're healthier in the sense that they try to keep theirselves better off because the healthcare system in general in other countries is so much worse --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but here, you know -- I was actually at the dentist's office the other day, and one of the dentists mentioned -- like in -- I guess for a dental system and choose from, I'm not sure which country she's from -- [inaudible] from Europe and she was saying that when she -- you know, when she was younger in the US or in other country it was when people went to the dentist, the dentist would say you know, "Raise your hand if it hurts", or -- and people were just screaming in dentist offices, and now people walk in, you know, wanting appointments just for cleaning and they actually want to be there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, no -- you know, let me get a check up -- well before I was like unless something's really, really hurt, you don't go.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think you know -- just -- the US has such a better healthcare system overall and it's not that people are much healthier.
L:  Um, but don't you think that we sort of overdo it -- we run to the doctor when -- we expect a pill, um, instead of maybe, ah, toughing it out and, and I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH] And --
L:  -- it just seems like we're kind of wusses sometimes. 
R:  I mean yeah, I mean, I feel like every time I go, like if I ever go the doctor for a- ...
