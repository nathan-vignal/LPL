L:  H-
R:  Katrina[?] Alexander.
L:  Hi Christina, my name's Anne.
R:  Okay, how are you?
L:  I'm doing fine.  How are y- --
R:  So, where -- I'm good.
L:  Good [LAUGH] -- um, do you prefer eating out or eating in?
R:  I actually prefer eating out if at all possible --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- it's not always practical, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I do prefer it.
L:  And what --
R:  -- that means I don't have to cook.
L:  Ah, okay. 
R:  So, what about yourself?
L:   I would much rather eat in.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, my husband and I kind of have a policy that if we go out to eat we have to go somewhere where they can cook food better than us.
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, are you guys -- are you really good chefs, or you just love to cook?
L:  Um we -- both.
R:  Okay.
L:  Both -- we've ah, I guess -- just practice makes perfect.
R:  Mhm, well that's true.
L:  So, what kind of places --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- do you like to eat?
R:  I really -- I have two small children so I enjoy getting away where I c- -- I enjoy going to restaurants where there are no children [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so that I can actually just -- I think eating out is more of a, a kind of a fantasy thing for me just -- you know, leave all the dishes, leave all the worries --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just to be able to get somewhere and relax.
L:  Yes.
R:  So I -- I -- I actually will eat any type of food, I'm not really picky about, ah, what type of restaurant --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- but I just like somewhere where it's good -- I guess the atmosphere makes a difference for me.
L:  Yes.
R:  So -- and at home because I -- when I'm at home I -- I'm -- my kids are really young, I have a seven year old and a four year old --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so their idea of dinner is ah, a pizza, or fish sticks --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or chicken nuggets, something like that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If I actually cook a real meal --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they don't eat it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know I -- I can slave in the kitchen for an hour or so and bring out dinner and they say, "Can I have some cereal?", or, "Can I have a pop tart?" --
L:  Uh-huh, right.
R:  So, that has turned me off as far as cooking goes. Maybe when you know they're older, then maybe I'll -- I might have a desire to cook, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- right now, it's like, it's just, you know, it's a waste of time because I feel like I'm just cooking for myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I think that's probably why I have a slight aversion to cooking and eating in at this point.
L:  You know, I swore that I would never become a short order cook --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, I have a nine month old, a two and a half year old and then me and my husband and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I cook one meal for, ah, for the adults, I cook another meal for the two year old and then I cook up -- well, you know, just warming up baby food for the baby --
R:  Right [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, I am the short order cook that I said I would never be [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, and that does happen, I know that when my kids were younger, I, you know, I thought, you know whatever I cook, they're going to eat it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then you know, I said well, you know, I realised that my son was not eating everything that I cooked, and didn't want to starve him to death so then [several inaudible words] it became, "Well, what do you want?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that's how it grew into the okay, "Well I'll make one meal for myself and something else for you" --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- so I completely understand and I've tried that now so when they're a little bit older maybe we can all eat the same thing --
L:  Oh dear.
R:  -- but even trying to eat the same thing it's always a different variation of the same thing, so it's still just as much cooking.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I can completely understand, it's just -- so I think for me, that's -- that's why I do like to get away w- -- we normally, when we go out to eat it's normally, like McDonalds or CC's Pizza or somewhere like that, that you know, that's kid friendly or buffet -- like my oldest son loves Chinese buffet.
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and so, you know, that's a -- and -- I've noticed that's the one place he actually will eat so much food because it's such a huge variety.  And I ask him, I say, "Well, why do you like to eat here?" -- "Well if you cooked like this at home I'd eat it" --
L:  Oh.
R:  I said "I'd have to cook everything" --
L:  Oh.
R: -- on the off chance that he might want something, I'm like, "Oh, okay".
L:  Oh dear.
R:  So, that's -- that's the logic behind that, he just thinks that you know, if he's supposed to eat a real meal he should have a huge variety to choose from.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Still, and in the real world it does not work that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- but I know once they get bigger it'll be a little bit different -- I'm sure they'll probably eat more and so I'll do more cooking as they grow older --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but right now, it's just, "Let's get something quick 'cause we're on the go", and I think that's, that's kinda where fast food comes in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not always the best, but it's just, it's fast food, it's convenient.
L:  You know the funny thing -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- is, um, one time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my, my toddler um, is on the bottom end of the growth chart and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so the doctor has said that he needs to gain weight whenever possible and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, I thought well we'll go to the fast food, ah, drive through and I'll pick up a little happy meal and -- he won't eat a hamburger --
R:  Really.
L:  -- he won't -- he will eat turnip greens out of a can.  He will eat Italian style spinach.  He will eat lentils from the Indian restaurant.  He eats hummus from the Mediterranean restaurant, but he won't eat a hamburger -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and he turns his nose up at ice cream [LAUGH].
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH] I have a strange son.
R:  Now, that is unusual.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Now, see I have my -- my ah -- my three year old is a little bit strange in his eating habits because he rarely eats, but he's a big three ye- -- every time people see him they think he's five --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- so he's a big boy, but he doesn't eat, and when he does eat he wants tomatoes, pickles, ah, cauliflower -- though -- though -- and he will eat them --
L:  Oh my --
R:  -- together.  If we go to a buffet he always gets the fruits and the vegetables --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- no meat -- he's not a big meat eater, I mean, the most he'll eat is he'll eat chicken nuggets --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  But he, he likes -- he likes fruit and vegetables and he eats them mixed together.  He will eat a lemon wedge and then eat a slice of pineapple or a peach or then eat some cauliflower, whatever you have, but he --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he loves tomatoes and pickles.
L:  What a riot.
R:  So, it's just, you know, it's like why cook?  Just buy some tomatoes and some pickles and he's, you know, he's good, so --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, he's never going to have cancer -- that's wonderful [LAUGH].
R:  No, I mean, he -- he loves to eat vegetables --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if I can get my older one to eat more -- he started out eating zucchini.  My mom used to make zucchini all the time, and so he would eat it with her and then he started eating cauliflower, but as he's getting taller and older he said, "Well, I don't really like those things anymore" -- 
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  -- "I'm going to pass them onto my brother".  I said, "You don't pass food on, you eat the food".  But he thinks he can just pass it down, so --
L:  Right [LAUGH]  
R:  -- but we're trying to work on him -- 'cause he's a -- he's kind of a fast food kid -- he likes McDonalds, but only the nuggets, no french fries -- neither one of them will eat french fries -- they just don't like 'em --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  -- if they -- if they eat french fries it's because I -- I make -- I make them.  I say, "Okay, look I have to pay three bucks for this meal, you're going to eat all of it" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Otherwise I'm just going to buy chicken nuggets, but then they don't get a toy -- so that's when they're, "Okay, I'll eat the fries" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but [COUGH], realistically they really don't care for them, they just want the, the chicken nuggets, so --
L:  That is too funny.
R:  -- I don't know, we jus- -- I -- I -- I don't think I'm ever going to have to worry about their health because they do eat pretty well when they actually eat and they're really active, so --
L:  That's good.
R:  But, you know, we, so -- and I -- I notice that -- I've tried to balance it that we don't eat out every night -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if we're going to eat out I look at our, our week and figure out what days we're really running --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and normally for us like, like on a Wednesday we're running all day because we have work and school and then church, so we'll try to get a fast food meal between getting to church, but then I'll try to cook to balance out the rest of the night -- you know, just kind of make it more even, 'cause I don't want them to think that it's only or always going to be fast food.
L:  Right.
R:  So, and I think my seven year old, he associates eating out with mom got paid --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, when mom gets paid, we get to eat out. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, and I say well, he says, "Well can we have [inaudible] tonight?" -- "No" -- "Oh, we must be broke".  So, that's ah -- that's how he associat- -- and it -- it doesn't mean no because I've said so, or no because I cooked, no means, "Oh, we must be broke", so --
L:  Well, [inaudible] --
R:  -- that's how he associates it.
L:  If -- if that's what works -- "Yeah, we're broke" all the time, always broke --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's it.
L:  -- not a problem [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] If that works -- if that gets them to eat something healthy then -- I -- I'll use it, but it's funny how they associate things like that, so [MN] --
L:  Mm, so if --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- you could have just the ideal meal, um, if you had a babysitter and you could go wherever you want and have the perfect meal, where would you go?
R:  I would go to this really nice Brazilian restaurant that we have here in Huston, it's high end, really upscale and they, they do all the work.  They serve you, they serve you right in front of you and that's kind of a -- a neat thing to go to.  I've never been but I have lots of friends that have gone --
L:  Brazilian.
R:  -- so that's what I would do.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I love Brazilian food.
L:  What's different about Brazilian?
R:  Oh, they have th- like -- they're -- they're -- they have these beans call [inaudible] and they are -- they're black beans and they're cooked with spices that I don't even know if we have in the States --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but they're just excellent.  The meats that they have are so rich, but there's not a lot of fat --
L:   Huh.
R:  -- and it's just, the seasoning, it's just something about the food it's just -- it's awesome food -- really, really good food.
L:  Wow.
R:  I think that would be my ideal, my ideal evening.  And how about you?
L:  Um, actually when my husband goes out of town, there's an Ethiopian restaurant I love --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he doesn't really care for it, but I just absolutely love it and it's incredibly priced -- I get the um, I get the vegetarian plate for seven dollars and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they serve me enough food, um, to last ...
