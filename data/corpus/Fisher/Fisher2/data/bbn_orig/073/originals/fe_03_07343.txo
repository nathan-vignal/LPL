L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, um --
L:  Hi, my name is Vicky.
R:  My name is Rebecca.
L:  I -- I'm not really sure if I understand exactly what it is that they want us to talk about.
R:  Um, well, ah, the way I understood it, ah, they say that a lot of people get sick when we have a change of -- change of seasons, and they want to know if we do --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and what we do to take care of ourselves and, I think the last thing was ah, something about -- they say a cold lasts seven days if you don't go to the doctor, but a week if you do.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, well, I -- I live in Michigan --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, the weather changes frequently, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ju- -- this, this year it seems like um, we've had one really nice day that seems like summer's here and then the next couple of days it'll -- it'll feel like [MN] you could ex- -- actually expect maybe that it would snow again --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, you know, so I do agree that that is a time of year where people do tend to get more colds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um ...
R:  I live in Oklahoma and we get a lot of the same -- I know it's a little bit of a warmer climate that what you have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we, we have [MN] days where you know -- a, a common saying around here is, "If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes" [MN].
L:  Yeah, like Michigan.
R:  But um, my big problem with the weather change is that I have really bad allergies --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in fact I'm having trouble with my allergies right now, and any time that the weather is conducive to, you know, pollen --
L:  Right.
R: -- flying around in the air, um, you know, whether it's cold or hot, if it's, if it's -- if some kind of plant is pollinating [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- I will have trouble with my allergies and most of the time I keep 'em under good control, but when they get too overwhelming -- even my medica- -- I have a good medication, but you know, everything has its limits.
L:  Do you, do you take shots?
R:  Um, I did for a while and they didn't really do much good [MN].
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Um, I -- right now I'm taking Zyrtec and it helps better --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than anything I've taken before, um, but it doesn't catch everything when I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when my allergies kind of get on overload, when everything is out -- and that's how it is right now.
L:  Yeah, do you take Flonase[?] with that as well, or ...?
R:  Yeah -- I'm sorry?
L:  Do you take Flonase as well?  With it -- no?
R:  No, I don't -- I, I tried it before and it doesn't really do any good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I really can't handle nasal sprays [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can't stand putting anything up my nose.  [MN] But um, I guess 'cause my nose is always stuffed up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't like having anything in there, but um, when, when my allergies do kind of get on overload and my medication isn't quite enough to handle them, that's when I -- I  get stopped up and get a sinus infection.
L:  Right.
R:  It's almost like, okay, it's June -- sinus infection time.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay, it's October -- sinus infection time [LAUGH] -- so that's kinda -- it, it seems worse in the spring and the fall for me, but --
L:  Right, I -- I don't really think that I have so much allergies, but I do get sinus, ah, you know, with the -- when it, when it's going to rain and so this time of year is -- our, our spring is um really wet --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I do think that people --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, tend to get sicker when you have the fluctuation in the weather, but a lot of times I think it's because [MN] -- they're so happy to feel just a little bit warmer that -- that it's like they think it's summer and you see the -- like the kids out with shorts on --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- and it's really only in the fifties, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I -- I -- I don't think I go to the doctor quite as often for just a regular cold though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I do tend to just sort of self medicate and you know -- I -- I don't think that there's really much that they can do, um --
R:  Yeah [MN].
L:  -- for a common cold, really --
R:  I --
L:  -- other than just make you comfortable.
R:  I have had so many sinus infections that I can actually tell from the way it comes on -- if it's a bacterial infection --
L:  Oh boy.
R:  -- or a viral infection.
L:  Well, then at least you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what to do about it.
R:  Yeah, ah, if I can tell that it's going to be a viral infection, I self medicate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and they never last long, um, if I can tell it's going to be a bacterial infection --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that's another matter -- I know that there is no way that I'm going to get through it without antibiotics, so if, if it seems like it's going to be a bacterial I go to the doctor.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, my doctor gi-, usually gives me Augmentin[?] which is a really good drug for sinus infections, we figured out [LAUGH], because it kicks it in the butt every time [LAUGH].
L:  Hm.
R:  So, um --
L:  Yeah, I don't ah ...
R:  Now, as far as anything else goes sometimes I don't know when to the -- when I should go the doctor and when I shouldn't, but I've, I've become such an expert on sinus infections [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, you know, you do -- I mean, you know your own body and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know -- I know that for a while they were saying you know, if you -- if you knew a cold was coming on just to take zinc --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then I heard something about how you know, they thought that that might be actually causing some other problems, so --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- I don't know, I, I think ah, common cold -- why really worry about it, and -- I mean, unless you're elderly and it's going to turn into pneumonia or something, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um --
R:  Um, I do think that -- I, I take a multivitamin every day, I actually take prenatal vitamins and I'm --I started taking them when I was pregnant and never stopped.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I've noticed I get sick less than I used to --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and with an almost three year in the house now, it's odd that I'm not getting sick that much [LAUGH] -- I mean at least --
L:  Well actually, it's because you're, you're actually being exposed to so many more germs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you're, you know, you develop more of an immunity to 'em -- these people that are ah, you know, real freaky about using those wipes, you know, those anti-, ant-, the disinfectant on everything and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they say that you're really going to cause yourself to become, um, more susceptible to things, because your body --
R:  Right.
L:  -- doesn't have a chance to ever build up the immunity -- but you know --
R:  I was like that for a while --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I'm kind of a germaphobe, um, anyway, I like -- I like to keep things really clean and sanitary and -- I was kind of over-, going overboard with the antibacterial products for a while and my doctor actually told me that that was doing more harm than good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so now, I just keep things as clean as I can and I, you know, just use regular, normal stuff --
L:  Yeah, because a friend of mine is a teacher and she doesn't get really bad colds and stuff because she's exposed to so much with the kids --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that you, you really end up developing immunities to it --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- I imagine next ye- -- my, my son's going to be starting preschool in September --
L:  Oh boy.
R:  -- and ah, I imagine that's going to be a fun year illness wise for our family [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well now though, you know, childhood illnesses, I mean most kids don't have anything -- they don't get measles --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they don't get mumps or anything, so ...
R:  Well you know, it -- I, I have had just about every viral infection known to man, and, and when I was a kid --
L: Yeah.
R:  -- and I breastfed my son, and he's not sick very often at all.  He's, he's never had an ear infection, which is apparently unusual --
L:  And that's what they say, that that's -- that's the big reason for breastfeeding --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is that it gives them something that, you know, that keeps them from getting ear infections, so ...
R:  Yeah, I -- and I didn't -- I wasn't able to breastfeed him for a whole year because he -- when his first teeth came in, his bottom teeth came in literally overnight --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- he was about five months old, and he didn't know what to do with his tongue when he was nursing.
L:  Wow, five months [LAUGH].
R:  It's -- he weaned himself when he was five months old, I mean, he, you know, he was -- he was still on a bottle, but he weaned himself from the breast at five months 'cause he didn't know the right way to suck any more because of --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- you know, because of his teeth.
L:  Well, that's really early to have teeth come in, really.
R:  Yeah, I -- I wanted to breastfeed him for a year but it -- it seems like the five months still did him good, I mean he's hardly ever sick --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he's, he's happy and we're really well bonded, so ...
L:  Yeah, now my son -- my son took um -- I gave him liquid vitamin C, every day --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- when he was little, and he didn't get a lot of colds either so, but he's -- I think the only thing he ever had was um, chicken pox -- he got that, and it was right before the -- I was -- he, he was visiting his dad, he was -- it was right before I was going to take him in and get that new shot so that wouldn't get 'em and he came home with 'em, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But they didn't really last very long so -- 
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- not, not that difficult.
R:  -- my, my chicken pox -- I think I -- I, I was bragging at one point that I was, was the only person I knew who was fourteen and hadn't had chicken pox yet, and then my brother got it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it was just a matter of time before I did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I had chicken pox and -- I -- it, it came and went -- my mom said it wasn't that bad, but she's not the one that had them [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I didn't have ch- -- ever have chicken pox, but I did get the mumps and that was bad, oh, oh --
R:  Oh, I -- I hear that's miserable.
L:  I had measles several times I think.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, more than once, so --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- but I think it's nice that they're wiping out all those childhood diseases, I just hope people don't stop giving the shots thinking, "Okay now, I really don't -- it doesn't even exist, I won't bother with the shots", you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's why there's like -- they, they think that polio is, and TB and things are making a comeback.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's ...
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  And, you know, there, there are a lot of scary things about vaccinations -- I've -- I tried to be as well informed as I could before my son was born, I read everything I could get my hands on, and I know there are some things about the vaccinations to be concerned about but --
L:  [NOISE] Well --
R:  -- when I kind of weighed the pros and cons I thought the, the risks of him getting the illnesses was greater than the risks from the vaccinations.
L:  Yeah, because there are a lot of people who swear their kid was totally normal until they got this certain vaccination and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they ended up being autistic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that is scary -- to think that you know, well, maybe, you know maybe they're right, I don't know, you know, it is, it is scary, but I don't know, there's just so many -- like you said there's so many things though that -eah -- you just have to weigh the, the pros and cons --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and hope for the best really, but -- I don't know, but I think um -- the, the older I get it just seems like the more I realize that doctors just don't really know that much -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean the really good ones will admit that they really don't know a lot, and you know, that some of the old home remedies are probably just as effective as some of the medicines that they've got now. 
R:  Our, our pediatrician is pretty -- has been pretty forthcoming about stuff like that, ah, you know the stuff that she, she might not know or that she believes that a certain remedy is better than what, what a lot of people think, and stuff like that -- she's really good about it --
L:  You mean like, like um, sh- give some credence to holistic medicine or something, or ...?  
R:  Ah, to a point I think --
L:  Or she'll tell you there's, there's pros and cons to each one and you make the decision.
R:  Ah, basically yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She, she keeps us pretty well informed and lets us make our own decision and that -- that's the way it should ...
