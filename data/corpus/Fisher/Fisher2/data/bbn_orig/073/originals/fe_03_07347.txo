R:  Ah, this is Don Sampson.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  [NOISE] Ah, [NOISE] fine.  I think I know a little bit about the topic.
L:  Okay.  My --
R:  I --
L:  -- the phone is kind of, like, um -- [LIPSMACK] it sounds weird.  Are you on a speakerphone or something?
R:  No, I'm not.  Just a regular hand held phone.
L:  Um, no, it's better now.  Okay.  Um, okay, so, wellness -- um, or illness -- no, it was illness, right?
R:  Yeah, seasonal.
L:  Uh-huh.   So, how do you feel about that?
R:  Well, ah, I was from Ohio and, ah, almost every January, ah, there would be a virus going around and everybody would get it.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, as a salesman being outside I would find out that, ah, all my accounts would invariably say the same thing, that they get sick at, ah, Christmas and January, ah, like I did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And after moving to California, um, I notice that there's a big difference.  It's -- so, it must have been the severe winters in Cleveland, ah, cre- -- either created an environment for the virus, or, ah, made the virus more severe, because if, um, I get something now it's so minute that I haven't missed a day of work in seventeen years in California.  So, it's a big difference.  It's, ah --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  It's much more, ah, oh, health, ah, favorable here as far as, ah, you do what -- you work outside more and do things outside.  And, ah, it's, like, nine months a year where you can -- you can be outside.  And, ah, nine months of the year in Ohio you were inside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with forced gas air, you know.  And it's --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- so -- it's so different here that I, ah -- I'd have a hard time locating -- relocating I think if I had to.  But, ah, I notice that, ah, should you get something it's not very bad here as, ah, some of them would last a good, ah, two -- three months the viruses.  And my wife would get the same thing.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, ah, it's very, ah -- ah, [MN] the viruses seem like they're weaker and fewer.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, that's pretty much about it.  I don't do much for them.  I don't think there's -- ah, antibiotics work on a virus.  As far as I know they just work on --
L:  No they don't.
R:  No, just bacteria.  No, there -- there is no antibiotic for a virus.  Ah, secondary infection maybe, of a bacterial nature, but not -- ah, not a, ah, virus itself.  They're --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- too small.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, what location --
L:  And --
R:  -- are you in?
L:  I'm the same -- California.
R:  Are you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- California also?  I'm in San Diego.
L:  No, um, Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, I see.  Yeah.
L:  So, it's pretty much the same, I guess.
R:  Yes it is.  Yes, I'm in LA a lot myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, just --
L:  Yeah, but I -- I moved here from Chicago too, so I, um --
R: Oh, you're form back east --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- also?
L:  From Chicago.  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  That's similar, I think, to Ohio in that, ah --
L:  Yeah, I think it is.
R:  -- June, July and August you have summer.
L:  Yeah.  And it's really extremely hot.
R:  And, ah, humid.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And, yeah -- yeah.  [MN] it's so, ah --
L:  But, almost, like -- um, like, hot, but too hot, you know.  Like, that it --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- makes you feel uncomfortable.
R:  Yeah.  It's rare that, ah, it's, ah, a great day.  And then I can remember planning a picnic and it would rain.  And, ah, so I'm kind of spoilt here.
L:  Yeah, it's really nice here.  Uh-huh.   And I notice that -- I don't know -- I tend to get, um, colds a lot and -- and, like, um, sore throats.
R:  Well --
L:  [MN]
R:  That --
L:  And I --
R:  -- I gu- --
L:  -- still get them here, not as much, but I still do.
R:  Do you have a sinus, ah, condition here?
L:  No.  I don't know. I just -- I just -- ever since I was a kid I just tend to get these, you know, colds --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, yeah, sinus and sore throats.  I just tend to get them.
R:  Well, I notice, ah, here the -- the only drawback here is that the dry air would once in a while make my sinuses bleed.  So, I --
L:  Really?
R:  -- went to a -- oh yeah.  And a lot of my friends have the same problem, especially, like, from New York and Buffalo and, ah, um, Illinois.  Um, they say the same thing.  I never had it back east.  And I -- so, I went to an eye, ear, nose and throat guy.  Kind of worried myself about it.  And he said, "It's very common.  Are you from back east?"  I says, "Well, yeah, Cleveland".  And he said, "Well", he said, "I'm from Buffalo myself".  He says, "I know what you're talking about.  It's the dryness.  Your body's not acclimating itself to that".  So, what I did was, ah, I -- I had him make up a, ah, thing for me.  It's -- ah, I think it's called Jewish or kosher salt.  And, ah -- oh, what's the, ah -- I'm trying to think of the -- baking soda.  And a tablespoon each in water -- tepid water.  And, um, I rinse, ah, you know, with a little syringe when I get a sinus infection, or what I think is a sore throat.  And it knocks it out right away.  So, I have yet to have a sore throat in the past seven years.  And he told me -- he said, "This'll be better for you than any medication you can get".  And so, I --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- I had a lot of doubts about it.  And then I found out that, ah -- ah, one of my friends -- is a pilot for United Airlines -- he takes it.  And he had the same problem.  He was from back east and he kept getting, ah, like, sinus infections that would build up and bleed.  And, ah --
L:  Well, I've never had that.
R:  Yeah.  Well, he -- he was quite scared.  He thought he'd had a stroke or something.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And, ah --
L:  I'd be too.
R:  Yeah.  But, he -- he -- it -- what it does is it -- also if you get a stuffy nose it makes the breathing just great.  You know, it's, ah -- it kind of, ah, acts like a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, I don't know the word for it, but it -- it shrinks the, ah, da- -- ah, the, ah, passageways.  And you can breathe real easy.  I --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- used to be -- ah, think I was hooked on these, ah, things that you pu- -- you know, you squeeze into your nostril.
L:  Nasal sprays.  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah.  Na- -- the nasal sprays.  I used to think I was hooked on 'em because it got to where I couldn't breathe nice, ah, without --
L:  I've tried --
R:  -- the thing.
L:  -- those before, 'cause I occasionally -- like, when I have a cold, I will only use them, you know, at night when I go to sleep.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, um, I never get hooked on them.  I'll use them for two or three days and then I'll just stop.  And I won't use them in the daytime.  So, for me they're, you know, okay.  But, I've heard of people that get, um, almost like addicted to them.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But, you know something?  If you try this you'll never use them again.  You won't need them.  It's amazing.  And all -- it's the most natural thing in the --
L:  It's, ah --
R:  -- world.     
L:  -- baking soda or kosher --
R:  It's a teaspoon --
L:  -- salt?
R:  -- of baking soda and a teaspoon of, ah, kosher salt.
L:  Just regular salt that you --
R:  No.
L:  -- would buy in a Jew -- Jew --
R:  No.
L:  -- store?
R:  It's kosher salt.  It's, ah, a special section.  And, ah, the reason is it's a refined larger salt and it has some kind of, um, ah, additional chemicals in it.  And, ah, it just does a great job.  And yo- -- I use about a -- almost, ah, a quart of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- water.  And I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- just -- and I mix --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it up, ah, somewhat --
L:  Cold --
R:  -- warm.
L:  -- water, or ...?
R:  No, not cold.  Just tepid, you know.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  And then, ah, I have a -- I buy a -- I bought a syringe though.  A larger one that you, like, do for ears, you know.  Not an eye syringe.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I asked him.  He said, "No, you wanna a little bit larger one".  So, I s- -- ah, saw what he meant afterwards.  And, ah, it just worked.  It works great.  I -- I don't buy this stuff.  And you don't have to use it every day.  You just use it when you feel like the nasal passage is closing up, or it's hard to breathe, or it's stuffy nose, or you --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- feel like maybe you're getting a sore throat.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It'll knock --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- a sore thr- -- you know what?  A lot of the sore throats is simply sinuses draining down.  Did you know that? 
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I used to do, ah -- ah, singing quite a bit.  This was years ago.  And, ah, I -- I stopped it the b- --
L:  Ah, so -- ah, so do I.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah, because I -- I -- I've been studying voice.  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah.  I used to do, ah -- well I sang at W.E.W.S. -- Channel five in Cleveland, Ohio.  And --
L:  Oh, yeah -- yeah.  I've been singing for, like -- yeah, I been, ah, doing this for a while too now -- for, like, um, five years --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  I was at a --
L:  -- yeah, I been singing.  So -- so, that makes you get a sore throat too?
R:  Oh yeah.  If you do a lot of it, you know, it strains --
L:  Maybe --
R:  -- the voice.
L:  -- that -- mi- mi- might also be the case why I tend to get it, 'cause I -- I noticed that when -- also when I get aggravated --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it goes in my voice. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.  It -- it will, ah -- the, ah, vocal chords tend to swell.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, even sometimes [MN] anything stimulating, ah, will cause that too.  It's just like your blood vessels dilating or -- or, ah, constricting.  You know, they just -- the body reacts in special ways, so --
L:  Yeah, yes, yeah.  You -- 'cause all -- yeah, that must be one of the reasons.
R:  But, you can get a sinus infection and not really know it.  And then when it drains itself it drains down into the throat, and you can get a sore throat.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  That's the typical pattern.  When you inhale --
L:  Okay.  So, you, um, mix it with water.  And then what do you do then?  You don't -- you can gargle probably too.
R:  You can what?
L:  Ah, so what do you do again?  You -- you mix it with water.  And then what do you do again?
R:  You store it -- you store it in, like, say for example, a milk bottle -- a glass milk bottle.  Has --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- to be glass.  And then you, ah -- you use this -- you --
