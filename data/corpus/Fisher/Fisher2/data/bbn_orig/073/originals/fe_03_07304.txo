L:  Hello.
R:  Um, hi.  [LAUGH]  I'm Nancy.
L:  Hey, how's it going?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  Good.
R:  Um --
L:  Uh -- what's your name?
R:  Uh, my name's Nancy.  
L:  Nancy, hi.  This is Anu- -- my name's Anun, uh, Aziz.  Uh, food.  So, what are we supposed to talk about?
R:  Well --
L:  Res- --
R:  -- it said about, do we like eating in a restaurant better or at home?
L:  I see.  +Well, I really like to cook just because it's like one of things that are like, uh, it puts me at, like, ease, you know.  Like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it kind of relax -- so I love [inaudible] to cook.  So ...
R:  Well, see, you're -- you're probably a little younger.  I like to cook too but I think I've just switched to liking eating in restaurants [LAUGH] anymore.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, yeah, I bet it gets like too much work at -- at -- after a certain point.
R:  Uh-huh.  I like to cook but th- the -- the other thing is too now, it's just, um, my husband and I and so it's -- it's -- you know, it was always kind a more fun to cook for a crowd or if we have people coming over --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a lot of fun.  
L:  Yeah, like my mom doesn't like to cook, uh, as much because I think she got, like, bored with what was going on.  You know.  Like after a certain point you can't like -- like you start getting the same reviews from whoever you're cooking for.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And also -- and also cleaning up is -- is really a hassle.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, no kidding.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I've kind a solved that.  Now the person who cooks then the other one cleans up so that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at least -- that at least works good but ...
L:  +Yeah, but in that case I would much rather be the person who cooks than the person --
R:  Yeah, me [LAUGH] too.  [LAUGH]  And -- and, um, [MN] except that, yeah, the clean up person isn't as -- quite as good at it as -- as could be so I -- it doesn't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- always end up to [LAUGH] be.  Just be a no brainer.
L:  You get to clean anyway.  [LAUGH] 
R:  What kind of restaurants do you like to eat in when you do eat out?
L:  Um.  It +varies.  Uh, let's see.  I -- I like -- I like a lot of, like, fusion cuisine.  Like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- something new, you know.  I don't -- I don't really like to go to someplace that's like [MN] same old stuff.  Uh --
R:  Right.
L:  The same old cuisines and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, what about you?
R:  Yeah, I really prefer -- I mean, actually like ethnic restaurants or fusion as well.  I -- I mean I would never even order stuff that I could cook at home or not [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but really I would much prefer to order things I wouldn't generally make and, um, you know, it's just a [MN] something in that leads me to maybe even make it sometimes as well, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I kind of been big on sushi lately.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  Sushi's great.  I love sushi.
R:  Uh-huh.  And that's something I never would make at home, so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually I tried to make sushi once and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- uh -- yeah, I tried.  Like I bought, you know, sushi gra- sushi grade tuna and -- and I tried --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, like, I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  Like to really --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- eat it raw.  Because, like, I don't know.  It's something else, like, if you see what's going on and you're just like taking like a raw piece of meat and just try to eat it.  Like, you just --
R:  Exactly.
L:  It just doesn't work.  Like you have to [inaudible].  Somebody else has to do it and, like, present it and stuff.  Because it looks so nice, like ...
R:  It -- it does.  I mean and -- and, um, yeah, I don't think I could ever do that.  I know my, uh, my daughter in law they're -- well, they're to be -- +they just got a little sushi thing and, I mean, they've done the whole sushi roll.  I think they mostly do more California type rolls which is not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- raw fish --
L:  Okay, right.
R:  -- or any of that but, um, and it's a lot of fun.  You know, they have the whole little roller deal or -- well, I don't even know how you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- the kit to do it which -- but, um, yeah, nonetheless I just think that's one of those things I prefer to eat out.  
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Definitely sushi's one of those things.
R:  Are -- are you a barbecuer?
L:  Uh, I -- I am sometimes.  Un, whenever I go home really because, um, like, on campus we don't really have, like, you know, [several inaudible words] of grills but ...
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I go home, uh, well I'm from Texas.  My -- my hometown's Tex [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...  There's a lot of barbecuing going on and -- and, uh, it's usually like, you know, pretty nice weather, it's not that cold so you can usually, like, get out in the barbecue so ...
R:  Right.
L:  So it's fun.  So it's --
R:  Well, we're from Seattle and it's often not that nice weather but a lot of people here --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- just barbecue year round anyway.  [LAUGH]  I mean a little --
L:  Yeah, you guys --
R:  A little -- a little rain can't --
L:  -- guys have really good --
R:  Um.
L:  I've never really been there but you guys have -- supposed to have really good, uh, fish, right?  Like salmon?
R:  Yeah.  We sure do.  And especially like the sushi, you know, restaurants are just really good and [MN] everywhere too now.
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah.
R:  So that's, uh -- there's this [MN] a new place which is, I think, a chain on the west coast.  We haven't been there yet.  It's a big, um, [LIPSMACK] I think it's like an all you can eat sushi bar.  It kind of -- I don't know, that seems just a little too ...
L:  Yeah.  You know, I once went --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to one of those in, uh, Philadelphia.  That's where I -- that's where I go to school.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And, um, it was this all you can eat sushi place but they mostly like put rice on the -- on the, you know, on -- on the sushi.  So it's like a lot of rice.  So it fills you up pretty quick.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, once we went there with [MN] -- once we went with a group of my friends and, uh, one of the guys just, like, ordered a lot of food, you know, and, like, the -- the -- the deal is [MN] it's all you can eat but, uh, if you don't finish everything on your plate then they charge you regular price for it.  
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  So he -- he, um, he ordered all this food, you know, and like he found something he didn't like so then we had to go back and forth to the bathroom with, like, sushi in our pockets.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Really?  That was how it --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- worked, huh?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Whoa.
L:  And we weren't the only ones I think, because there's a lot of sushi in the bathroom.
R:  [LAUGH]  Huh.  That -- I've never heard of that whole [MN] -- that whole way of [MN] saying how --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean I could see, you know, they have 'em where you can't take things home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  That makes sense but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to pay for it if you don't eat it that's, like, uh, being punished.
L:  I -- I g- -- yeah, I guess it's good kind a 'cause, uh, I guess it keeps their -- their cost down.  You're not going to order everything in the world and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] eat it.  
R:  Yeah, I guess there is some -- some, uh, justification but, wow, I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- never -- I've never done that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'll have to be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- aware of that when -- if -- if --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we do go to this place.  It's actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they just opened so they're even offering, um, you know, a free meal on your birthday or whatever, and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- my son's birthday's coming up so we might --
L:  [MN]  
R:  -- [MN] do that.
L:  Very good.  [inaudible].
R:  But I better check the, uh, the requirement there first.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm glad you mentioned that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  That's funny.
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  So are you in a house or apartment?  I mean, are you able to --
L:  Uh, we --
R:  -- cook at school or ...?
L:  Well, I'm a senior now so we just finally got a house --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and -- with a couple of my friends, yeah.  So, it's -- it's -- it's pretty fun.  It's a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- better than [inaudible] I think, you know.  
R:  Who taught you to cook?  Just by yourself or did your mom [inaudible] at it?
L:  Um, my mom, um, my mom and my dad actually both cook.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, they're both pretty good too but, um, I kind a learnt from my mom.  I -- I -- I like read a lot of cooking books and watched the food channel a lot and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They had a -- actually I went to boarding school for -- for a couple of years so I guess I [inaudible] to cook there, you know, by ourselves.  Sometimes.
R:  Right.  
L:  So ...  I kind a just picked it up.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, good for you.
L:  So ...  Yeah, I guess it's a good skill to have.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Is the food on campus, would you call that restaurant type food or no or ...?  You know, I mean a lot of 'em are now so upscale [MN] that ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  Um, we have some -- we have some really upscale places.  Like actually some really good sushi places too.  Um, but we also -- there's also some like, you know, kind of, uh, McDonaldsish like type of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- stuff.  [MN]  But the, uh, the dining services actually here, like, they're not that great, you know.  Like --
R:  Oh.
L:  As soon as you can get off the dining service you kind of have to try --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] all that -- not that great.
R:  Right.  Huh.
L:  And the prices are just ridiculous for dining services as opposed to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like regular.
R:  Huh.  Yeah.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wasn't sure what that -- what the latest was on that.  We're -- we're a couple years outside of that so I wasn't sure --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- where [LAUGH] -- where that all fell into place.  Huh.  So do you, um -- when you go out to restaurants are you looking usually for atmosphere or food or price or ...?
L:  Uh, food, I think, yeah.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Food.  Um, I -- I really don't like the places that look -- try to be too trendy and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their [inaudible] not that great, you know.  Just cause I feel like you're paying more for being there than for the food.
R:  Right.
L:  And I'd much rather have, like, good food, you know.  
R:  Yeah.  I -- and, uh, especially what I r- -- I like to try a- avoid is and I don't know why.  That's probably a bias or whatever but, like, the chain restaurants.  If you fi- -- if I find a great, you know, independent owner kind a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- restaurant, like --
L:  Yeah. Like -- yeah, 'cause I think it's really hard to get newer ideas and, like, newer types [several inaudible words] like chain restaurants, you know.  You're probably not going to find that there.  
R:  Right.
L:  Like a chili or ...
R:  Or -- right.  Or restaurants like that have -- I hate the kind where it's, you know, [MN] everything you can possibly imagine they have on the menu.  I mean, there's a time and a place for that but, you know, like the cheesecake factory and I don't know --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- if you have that --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- out there.
L:  Yeah.  You -- you -- you feel like that they can't really specialize in anything if they can't really like produce one, like, really good thing, you know.  Like --
R:  Right.  Exactly.  It's -- it's kind of interesting too, we've been kind of [MN] little bit doing [MN] the -- I don't know if you're, the, you know, the Atkins diet thing.  Not really --
L:  Oh, right, yeah.  My parents are doing that now.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of we're tailoring it to ourselves which is probably totally ineffective but just [LAUGH] kind of being aware of carbohydrates and all that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, it's, uh, it's amazing the -- it's funny even just at where we were the other night.  I mean, they have like part of their menu listings are called, you know, The Atkins blah blah blah.
L:  Oh, that's [inaudible].  That's crazy.
R:  Salmon or whatever.  And ...
L:  Yeah, I guess there's always like some new type of, uh, diet trend or, you know.
R:  Right.  I mean, this one -- I mean, I'm -- it seems so crazy because it's, you know, the fruits and all that you're supposedly not 'cause of the sugar but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] the carb part -- the, uh, not eating, you know, so many --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- carbs as got some --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- valid points to it, I'd say.
L:  Yeah, that makes sense.  
R:  It's not --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- easy though when that's your favorite stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true.  
R:  We're talk- we're talking --
L:  So wha- what is your type of, uh, favorite food?
R:  Um, pretty much seafood and -- and it used to be I would really love, you know, various pastas but that, like, I said, all of a sudden now I have --
L:  [MN]  Right.
R:  -- this great awareness that that's got so many carbs, which I knew before but I tried to ignore.  
L:  Right.
R:  But, um --
L:  Yeah.  Seafood is that great.  I -- I -- I really like seafood a lot.
R:  Uh-huh.  I like -- I really like, uh, ethnic, like Indian.  There's a lot of Indian restaurants out here that we go to too --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, um -- or, you know, there's a Thai restaurant on practically every corner and I probably would say Thai is my favorite ethnic food.
L:  Thai, yeah, I -- I really like Thai a lot as well.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's just got every, like, sort of, flavor in it, you know.  It's really --
R:  Yeah.  It -- it -- [MN] you can have it from, you know, creamy kind of coconut milk s- milk stuff to just, uh, chili pepper and vegetable.  I -- I -- that's really probably my very favorite food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Let alone, uh, ethnic food, and so I try to ignore that whole rice -- rice thing.  We actually went to Thailand in, um --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, we -- it was -- it wa- -- it's different though.  The food there -- and there were some good things we found but not as -- they were more, um, [LIPSMACK] like here you could get, you know, curry something and it would have some meat and some vegetables and some tofu, what in it or whatever.  Whereas there you would just get pre beans[?], period, in -- you know, what I mean?  It was all --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- like ...
L:  Yeah, I'm sure it's a lot different.  Like Indian food -- like I'm actually Indian so like Indian --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the restaurant
