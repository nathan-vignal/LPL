L:  Hello
R:  Hi.  My name's Brandon.
L:  Hi, my name is Sheena.
R:  How are you today?
L:  I'm fine.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  Okay [LAUGH] Well, which one do you think is worse?
R:  Ah, I'm not too fond of gossiping.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's just one of those annoyances that I have because whenever I was growing up in school I always heard, like, people gossiping.  It would just make me mad.
L:  Right.
R:  Because it -- there's nothing really right about it.
L:  No, it can ruin people's lives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  More than just the other aspects of it, probably.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not too fond of, well, the drinking that's okay, probably the -- drinking too much probably isn't good.
R:  Yeah, true because I know a few people that drink a bit too much and then they do things they regret. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's really a not -- that -- that's not a very good thing.
L:  Yes.  Okay, what about smoking?
R:  Ah, well I'm sitting here smoking a cigarette right now, actually. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh are you?
R:  Yeah, so I can't really comment on that one.
L:  You want us to pass -- pass that one up, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's -- I quite comment on that one, I'm sitting here with a cigarette. [LAUGH] 
L:  You could have just pretended. [LAUGH] 
R:  You what?
L:  I said, you could have just pretended.
R:  Well 
L:  That's honest, right?
R:  Yeah.  Honesty counts.
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.  What was the other one, not exercising.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't comment on that one, I don't exercise, so 
R:  Yeah, in my opinion it's the person's choice if they want to exercise or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- like, I get up I walk around from class to class and that's my exercise for the day. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] What, you're in college?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh yeah, well that's enough exercise though.  That's quite a bit.
R:  Yeah, carrying a bunch of books and walking from class to class.
L:  Yeah, so that's your workout already. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Let's see, what else was the other one?  Not working out or --
R:  Eating excessively, I think.
L:  Yeah, that one's not too good either.  I guess.
R:  No.  No, I have a bad habit about that, like, if I see food in front of me and I'm hungry I'll -- there won't be any more food. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  If it's there you're going to eat it.
R:  Yeah, yeah, like, I have a really high metabolism and so I -- it just -- it burns away really quick.
L:  Oh, I wish I did.
R:  Yeah.  It's not bad, like, I don't -- I don't -- yeah, I don't condone people for eating too much or anything it's their choice.
L:  Yeah.  Well I live in Dallas, Texas, so we have an over abundance of restaurants and different kinds of restaurants and different things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to where it's kind of a -- a thing to do so it's [SIGH] and I like food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like the different taste of food, different, um, I guess the different -- like, I like real Italian food or real Mexican food or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I like -- I like food.  I like to eat different cultures.
R:  Yeah, f- -- food -- food's good.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I think I like to experience different cultures and their foods.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the drinking excessively can be bad.
R:  Yeah it can.
L:  Like we discussed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I like to social drink.
R:  Yeah, so- -- so- -- socialized it's okay but when you just -- when you go on, like, a beer run or something, you know, like a keg or whatever it might -- might get a little out of hand.
L:  Yeah.  I'm sure you see a lot of parties, huh?
R:  Yeah, yeah a friend of mine goes a lot of them.  I main- -- I mainly go to the computer parties and there's not much alcohol involved there.
L:  Oh really?  What do you do at computer parties?
R:  Ah, we hook up a whole bunch of computers up to a land -- ah, local area network --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- and then we just -- we sit there and play games, like, twenty four hours straight.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty fun.
L:  That sounds like fun.  And where are you from?
R:  I'm from Indiana, southern.
L:  Oh, okay.  I work with a girl up here that's from Indiana.
R:  Really?
L:  Mishawaka, or whatever I think is the name of it, it's a little bitty tiny place from what I understand. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it sounds familiar but I -- I'm from Bedford myself, it -- it's not much bigger.
L:  I don't know exactly where it's at, but anyway.  Let's see, I guess the habits that are involved in that, I guess the alcohol can be very addicting and it's kind of hard to get off.
R:  Yeah, same as cigarette smoking.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like I -- I picked it up a couple -- couple of months ago and wish I didn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a little late now, well it's never too late to quit but I just -- I don't really have the drive to quit.
L:  Yeah.  You might one day.
R:  Yeah.  They say a lot of people quit smoking [inaudible] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's when we're quitting, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not the most pleasant way, but it works.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I guess the -- what else can -- well -- th- -- you know, exercising can be addicting too which can -- exercising can be a good thing but it can lead to, I think in the other direction as well, and exercising too much to where it presents -- prevents other problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or presents other problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And food's addicting.
R:  Yeah.  Like, with the exercise, people start taking, like, ah, like, diet pills and supplements --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it usually they end up becoming dependent upon those and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, with my girlfriend she -- she's slightly overweight and she's been taking, like, ah, these diet pills and they make her not have any cravings for food at all, throughout the day.  So she'll go an entire day and maybe eat like a couple, like a bag of chips and a sandwich and that'd be it.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's really tearing her up and she don't realize it.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's not good for your system too if you -- you're not supposed to stay on them very long for one thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think ah, three or four months is the max.
R:  Yeah, something like that.
L:  But it can be -- it can be damaging to her system too, if she doesn't watch it.
R:  Yeah.  And then that just goes right along with smoking too, smoking's really damaging to the system. [LAUGH] 
L:  So you can't really say anything, can you? [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I can't.  It's just, ah [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It don't help none. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's like saying calling the black kettle black or whatever.  I can't remember what that saying is.
R:  That what?
L:  Cal- -- the black kettle calling another kettle black, I don't know the name of that thing is where you can't say one thing to somebody about their habit if you have one too.
R:  Oh, kind of like, ah, don't, ah, try and pull a splinter out of your brother's eye without pulling the tree log out of yours, or something like that.
L:  Yeah that's true, yeah.  That's a good one too.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yes.  Well, you could probably stop if you tried --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- but like you said, you don't want to right now, so 
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's just -- just another one of those things to spend money on, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If I didn't do that, I'd either go into the computers or a [inaudible]
L:  Oh no.  Well, you like computers?  Are -- are you going to school for that?
R:  Yeah.  I'm going up to Ivy Tech for, ah, computer information systems.
L:  Oh okay.  I'm somewhat literate in computers.  I can operate on 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I can't do the -- the technical stuff.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I sometimes over [inaudible] what I can do on a computer but I'm never too afraid to ask for help on 'em.
L:  Right.  Well now, do you think computers can be addicting?
R:  Yeah, they are. [LAUGH] 
L:  I can get on the internet and it's hard for me to get off. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, like -- like I -- I'll have my school book in front of me and I'll -- I'll be doing my homework and then, like, someone'll message -- message me over the computer and I'll start talking to them.  I'll put the homework aside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it just -- it -- it's not good because I -- I just -- I get so involved on the computer that I forget everything else around me --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like [inaudible] and I'll -- like we'll go -- we'll go -- we'll sit on the computers for like twenty four hours straight and by that time we're -- the caffeine starts to wear down and we're all passing out.
L:  [LAUGH] That could be addicting.
R:  Yeah, it makes you think [inaudible] are Sundays, and it's just -- it's weird.
L:  Oh no.  What else -- what else did they say?  I think that was about it, wasn't it?
R:  Yeah, something like that.  And then, I guess we could talk more about the gossiping or something.
L:  Yeah that's true.
R:  This is like, back in school it was -- I just hated the people that would gossip because usually they would make up stuff and it would only be damaging to people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was just -- I -- I always tried not to get myself into a positions where there would be gossiping involved.
L:  Right.  Well that's the best way to stop it, is to not get involved.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then sometimes it makes them stop and think that it's not right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] See, that -- that one hits kind of close to home with me right now because, um, I just heard this past week there's a rumor about me and some other guy going around here at work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not even nowhere near true, and you're thinking, you know, did anybody ever bother to ask me?
R:  Yeah, that -- that's one of the things about gossiping.  People never go to, like, the source of it.  They -- they always just believe the other people.
L:  Right.  Well it's not as juicy if you could get the real gossip.
