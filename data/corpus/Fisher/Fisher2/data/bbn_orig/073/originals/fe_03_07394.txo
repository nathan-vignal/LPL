R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name is Maria.
L:  Mine's Donna.
R:  Hi.  Nice talking to you.  Where're you calling from?
L:  I'm, ah, in Florida.  Where are you?
R:  Oh, we're in Long Island, New York.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yep.
L:  I've been there.
R:  Yep.  Oh, great!  I've been to Florida but it was a while ago.  I hear you have great weather there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It gets a little hot though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So 
R:  We have had rain but, you know, we've -- we'd like to have sunny days if we could.
L:  So, which of the personal habits do you think's worse?
R:  Um, what were they?  Gossiping, smoking --
L:  [MN] Ah, over eating --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not exercising.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, and I forgot what else.
R:  Ah, me too.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, not eating well or something like that.  Um, I was gonna say smoking because I'm not -- I'm not a smoker so it's easy [LAUGH] for me to say that.  
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  What about you?
L:  Well, I am a smoker but I do think that's probably one of the worst habits.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  I mean it's one of the hardest things to get over, you know, to quit.
R:  Yes.  This is what I've heard.  And they have a lot of products on the market these days to, to help you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And they're expensive, I think.  Some of the stuff, like, they have the patch, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then they have, um, hypnosis and all.  And, um, don't they have, like, some kind of, um, behavior modification too?
L:  Yeah, I believe so.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But 
R:  [SIGH] Um, so other than that, gossiping I'd -- I enjoy that. [LAUGH]
L:  I do too. [LAUGH]
R:  I hate to say it. [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's a harmless way to spend --
R:  Right.
L:  -- your time. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  And not exercising that's something I -- I have not been doing lately.  I mean, I -- I have been not exercising  let's say that.
L:  Yeah.  But I think if you work a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, by the time you get done working you're too tired to exercise.
R:  That is true.  This is absolutely true.  And then they say, you know, a- all work no play, you know, that makes you a dull person, so when are you supposed to stick that part in too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I mean when you have time to do what you really like, unless, you know, you're a sports enthusiast and [MN] exercising comes naturally.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which it doesn't for me [LAUGH] but I wish it did.
L:  No -- me e- -- me neither.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I don't think I over eat but I think I eat more of the wrong things.
R:  Oh, I do too.  Absolutely.  I have a terrible sweet tooth and that -- that's gotta stop.
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  You know?
L:  -- I -- I see people that -- that would qualify as over eaters that are thinner and healthier than I am --
R:  [SIGH] I know it.
L:  I mean they eat me under the table --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and -- and they're so thin. [LAUGH]
R:  And it's their metabolism, right?  Meanwhile, mine must be very slow 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can just look at the food and there you go --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- gaining another pound, you know.  But then they -- let's do that correlation between swimming -- I mean, smoking  what am I saying?  Smoking and over eating 'cause they say if you smoke that also inhibits your desire to eat.  Is that true?
L:  I think so.  Yeah --
R:  It's -- God.
L:  -- because a lot of times if I don't have time to eat --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, I'll smoke a cigarette.  Like, if I'm working and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I'll run outside and smoke a cigarette real fast instead --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- of jumping in the car and going somewhere and getting something to eat --
R:  No kidding.
L:  -- and going back to work.
R:  Now, how long does that usually last before the -- that wears off and you get hungry?
L:  Oh, a couple of hours.  About --
R:  Really?
L:  -- two hours.  Yeah.
R:  See I was always thinking about that.  I said, "Maybe I should start smoking".  But I don't like the smell --
L:  No.  Yeah.
R:  -- of it, that's the thing.
L:  Yeah.  I don't like the smell and I'm continually having to wash everything in the house.
R:  Really?
L:  Curtains and linens and --
R:  Ooh.
L:  You know, things that normal people don't have to wash that often.  You know, because --
R:  So it bothers you to -- the odor of it, huh?
L:  Yeah.  The -- the smell does and --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and when I go into somebody's house that doesn't smoke --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- like, the last thing I do before I walk out the door is that I -- I take a shower and wash my hair so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that the smells not on me.
R:  Yes.
L:  And then I go into somebody's house that's a nonsmoker --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I can smell it on my purse.
R:  Ooh!  Oh, my goodness.  So it's kinda strong.  How long have you been smoking?
L:  Um, about thirty years.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  That's a long time.
L:  An- and you would think, as my father died of lung cancer --
R:  [MN] Oh my.
L:  -- related to smoking that -- that, you know --
R:  Oh. [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- that I wouldn't smoke and I --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- don't want to be a smoker but it's just --
R:  No.  Mm.
L:  -- a habit that -- I've tried the patch, you know and I've tried the Nicorette gum and --
R:  You have?
L:  -- you know and -- and nothing seems to work for me.
R:  Oh, no.  But you enjoy it.  Let's talk honestly.  You -- you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have to, to be getting something out of it.
L:  Yeah.  I think it relaxes me.
R:  Mhm.  That's what I've heard.  Now, they have the different brands of cigarettes too, like, the low tar and all that.  Is -- is there a major difference between, like, Marlboros and, like, Advantage?
L:  Yeah, but I've tried with low tar --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cigarettes and -- and you just smoke twice as much --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or I -- I do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because you're not getting out of it what you're -- what the nicotine or what ever it is you're --
R:  Yes.  Yes.  
L:  -- craving out of it.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Oh.  It's tough.  It's tough to kick.  I mean, then they have the thing here in New York that there's no smoking allowed in, like, resta- restaurants or public places, um, [LIPSMACK] that's all been cut out.  Even bowling alleys.
L:  Yeah.  The- they're doing that here July first.
R:  Are they really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've done it already in the office complexes too.  I mean, if you want to have a cigarette you might have to go outside.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I've worked in bars for the last, ah, well, off and on, you know for years and years but the last seven years I've worked at the same bar.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's been non smoking for twenty years.  
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  And it's -- I mean, it's been a smoking es- establishment and all of a sudden --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at July first it's gonna change.  
R:  Oh.  Mm.
L:  And it's a bar and a restaurant.  One sides a bar, one sides a restaurant.
R:  I see, yeah.  Yep.
L:  But that will totally kill -- and one person works both sides.
R:  Oh, no!
L:  You know, so half of your business is the bar and --
R:  Of course.
L:  I was in there yesterday and I looked around and every single person in there was smoking.  I just recently left and -- and started going back to cleaning houses.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, because I -- I know it's gonna die out.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  You know, it's --
R:  But it's more profitable right, where you were at the restaurant bar?
L:  Not really.  
R:  No?
L:  Not really 'cause down here you can make anywhere from twelve to fifteen dollars an hour cleaning houses.
R:  That's awesome.
L:  Yeah.  And -- in --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- in the bar I made three dollars an hour plus tips, you know.
R:  Plus the tips, okay.  Yeah.
L:  Which [MN] made anywhere from forty to hundred dollars a day.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  It's not easy work but, you know, if you enjoy it too, hey you get to meet new people and stuff like that.  I mean --
L:  And smoke. [LAUGH]
R:  -- at th- -- at the restaurant place.  But, at --
L:  And smo- -- and smoke while you're working. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah.  Well --
L:  Well, I have to say, I -- I really do -- even though I'm a smoker I think that smoking is the worst personal --
R:  That's incredible.
L:  -- habit.
R:  Had -- did your mom spoke too, or no?
L:  Yes.  Both my parents --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- smoked.
R:  See that -- my -- my dad used to smoke.  I think he smoked for, like, twenty years and then, you know, he had some kind of cancerous thing on his lip.  The doctor said, you know, "You'd better stop --"
L:  Ugh.
R:  "-- smoking".  Yeah.  And that was a while ago.  Oh, God that was many, many years ago.  And he did stop so, [MN] you know, a lot of people from Europe -- he's European -- they, ah, -- it's, like, second nature to them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It's like no big deal like here; there they would never have a law like we have here about no smoking in public places, this and that.  None of that.
L:  No.  And -- and they're more open about everything --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- even their advertising --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  I mean in Europe you can drive down the road and they have billboards of tampons and things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which are feminine hygiene products --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- which you don't see that here.
R:  You're so right.
L:  You know, they hide it in the magazine or --
R:  You're so right.
L:  -- or something.  But not a big billboard.
R:  I never thought of that.  I never thought of that.  You're right though.  So that -- that to me I think is -- is -- and we agree on that about the smoking situation being one of the worst, ah, um, [LIPSMACK] habits that they listed there.  Gossiping, ah, I guess it can get you into trouble, you know, if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] it falls into the wrong hands but over eating, yeah.  That's kinda bad.  Not exercis- -- I do all of that. [LAUGH]  I gossip, I over eat and I don't --
L:  I -- I -- I used --
R:  -- exercise. [LAUGH]
L:  I think, ah, gossiping can also be just considered analyzing people who're -- or situations --
R:  This is true.
L:  -- you know?  
R:  This is true.  Yes.
L:  Not -- not --
R:  It's true.  You're right.  But, um, I think this whole study that they're doing is kinda fascinating and, um, [MN] I'm interested in it, you know.  The University of Pennsylvania I think is doing this thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I guess they're trying to see how people communicate with each other based on a topic.  I guess people that don't know each other and stuff like that and then they -- they go ahead and analyze that.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're listening to our gossip, Donna. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  About this topic, so ...  Well, you know, I don't know what else they want us to say about it.  I think it's the worst because, like I said, it's hard to -- it's hard to kick that habit, it's, um, [LIPSMACK] ha- -- you can talk better than I can about it.
L:  Well, I -- you know, I met a girl who was a personal trainer so she --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- was, ah, totally into the exercise.
R:  Right.
L:  But before she did that --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- she told me that she weighed like three hundred and something --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- pounds, she was a big girl --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- she smoked cigarettes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and once she started the exercising --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it released the endorphins --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- that she got from the cigarette smoking so by her exercising she quit smoking and then she also lost weight because --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- she started being more health conscious. 
R:  Really.  
L:  So it's -- it's --
R:  I -- I wonder --
L:  -- funny how one thing like that, [MN] cutting out one bad habit --
R:  Yes.  
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- knocked out three of hers.
R:  And she -- she was able to quit that easily once she --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- started with the exercise routines? 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Huh.
L:  She's a personal trainer.  She goes around to people's houses and -- and trains them.
R:  Oh, man.  I could use some of that because I don't have, like we said before, the right eating habits.  Like, I have, like -- I like desserts, I like coffee, I like, you know, the tea and all that --
L:  Yeah.  I believe that was another one of them -- to -- consumption of too much caffeine.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- other than -- I don't -- you know, being bad for you --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, health wise --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they say caffeine is, but I haven't really ever seen bad affects of caffeine on people.
R:  No.  I think what they do is they put the caffeine into pill form now to make you he- -- to help you lose weight.  And those diet pills --
L:  Yeah.  It is --
R:  -- it's nothing but caffeine, right?
L:  It is.  I -- I took that, um, Hydroxycut for a while --
R:  Oh.  I saw that.
L:  -- and it's in there.
R:  And how did it work for ya?
L:  It worked -- it worked really well for me --
R:  Really?
L:  -- um, when I was on it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, but -- but it made your heart beat too fast and -- 
R:  [SIGH] Uh-oh.
L:  -- and so I only took it for two weeks --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but I think I lost ten pounds in two weeks on it.
R:  Did you really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But you -- but you didn't eat anything else right? 
L:  [MN]
R:  You just took the pill and had water, probably.
L:  I -- I took the pill and I ate, um, only beef --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and greens.
R:  Okay.
L:  It actually makes you not crave carbs --
R:  I see.
L:  -- which is the bad thing, you know.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I -- I am --
