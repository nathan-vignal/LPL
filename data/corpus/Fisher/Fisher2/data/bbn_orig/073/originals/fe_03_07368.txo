R:  Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Yeah.  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Revance[?] [NOISE].
L:  Yes.  I'm Roxetta[?].
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Um  I guess illness.  [SIGH] Um, yes, I do get more ills during certain periods when the seasons change.
L:  Oh.  [MN] Where are you from?  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm North Carolina.
L:  Oh.  Are you in North Carolina too?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All right.  I thought maybe it was some place else since it was eleven o'clock at night. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No.  So, you're in North Carolina as well?
L:  Right.  Mhm.  Yeah, I'm in Charlotte.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I'm in Durham.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.  Well, when seasons change, um, right away I start taking medications.  Yes.
R:  Yes.  Especially in the spring when the pollen gets up, my allergies act up, um, um, in a -- in a most severe way.  And, I have, um, prescription medication for that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I do.
R:  Which usually I use throughout the year but it just -- it's more so in the spring and summer.
L:  Yeah.  Well, same here.  I take al- -- um, [LIPSMACK] well, what happens with me I get terrible coughing spells.
R:  Yes.
L:  When the pollen is up.  And doctors have [NOISE] treated me from everything from [NOISE] stomach to throat and -- but we find it's allergies because as long as I take the Excedrins, not Excedrins, ah, ooh, Allegra --
R:  Okay.
L:  As long as I take my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Allegra and take it on time every day I'm pretty good.
R:  Okay.
L:  But if I miss it an hour it's, like, it runs out of my system and I'll start having the terrible coughing spells again.
R:  And, what -- what -- do you know what allergen it is that, um, that --
L:  Mold, mildew --
R:  Mo- --
L:  -- um, rag weed, ah, I go through quite a few of them.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, oak summit -- something -- something they told me --
R:  So, you have multi allergens that you're allergic to?
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I have multi allergies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, certain kinds of, you know, dust and stuff like that.
R:  Well, you need to -- usually I try -- where I am now it's -- it seems to be moldy in certain places for whatever reason and I try to, ah, you know, clean extra good.  I thought about getting a humidifier.  Anything to keep the mold down.  But, it seems that in certain areas that -- in the house, it's -- it's worse, um, that I've -- that I've ever seen before.  So, I wonder sometimes is -- does that cause me to act up more so than where I was previously before I moved?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, ah, [NOISE] we have -- fr- from my understanding North Carolina has a -- is -- is, ah -- especially Charlotte.  It's a lotta -- it's a lotta trees --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things.  Um, where I used to live at, I had a yard full of trees and things.  It wasn't a bad because I didn't have flowers I just had trees and -- 
R:  Yeah.  I -- I just think that's pretty common in this state.  I mean, when I look in the back it's just full of pine trees especially.
L:  But, ah, we -- most of the trees in the yard were all, um -- I think there was one oak tree.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the rest of them were other kind of trees and I wasn't allergic to them.  I didn't have an allergic reaction [NOISE] --
R:  Maybe it was just oak.
L:  -- and then I moved from that house to another house and these trees where I am now it's, like, "Ach, [NOISE] I don't want to go outside". 
R:  What -- do you what kind of trees they are?
L:  I don't know what kind they are.  [LIPSMACK] See I'm actually from Philadelphia so that I don't know nothing about trees in North Carolina.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nothing at all.
R:  And the thing -- the thing that they said about the doctor for a cold.  If you have a cold and don't go to the doctor it lasts for seven days or if you ? 
L:  I don't know.  I don't -- I've never heard that.  I don't get colds.  I --
R:  Me -- oh -- I -- well -- I hav- --
L:  I don't really get colds.  I -- most of the time when I think I have a cold it's allergies.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  So, I have no -- I -- I -- I haven't a clue, unless it's a chest cold.
R:  Yes.
L:  And, if it's a chest cold I'm going to the doctor.
R:  Yes.  I thought I was getting a lot of colds until I found out it was nothing but allergies.  Um, until, ah, um, I hit upon the right prescription that the doctor put me on.  And I haven't been sick.  I've never really been out or, um, you know, ill ever since then.  Using the medication if I feel it coming on it'll take care of it.  And now, because of it, when I do get sick it's not as severe as it was.  But, li- -- I think like you I've never really had any colds f- for -- for years.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so --
L:  And, with when my head is stuffed up I use Flonase and that usually opens it right up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know.  And, I also know that dust mites have an effect so I have to spray, ah -- have to s- -- keep my bed vacuumed and sprayed all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Expr- -- especially my bedspread.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, if I keep those down then I don't have too much of a problem.
R:  Yeah.  I thin- -- I think -- yeah.  Because I know, um, we have carpet and I was thinking about maybe putting down a hardwood floor because I know with carpet you can track in all kinds of things and it can stay there and linger and, you know, and it's a -- and -- and cause, you know, me to get ill or allergic to something.  Instead of vacuuming all the time, I think it's just easier to have a wooden floor and, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And I try to keep the dust down and everything like that, um, like you do.  That does help a lot.  Keeping mold down and, um, not letting it get too cold if I'm not home for a long time.  I guess, you know, what you -- you get damp or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- without having the heat on or if I'm away.  But, um, I've never heard of the cold thing before -- about not going to the doctor.  It -- it -- wha- -- last long -- well, does it last longer versus if you go to the doctor.  I can't recall what they said.
L:  I -- I know -- I never -- that's not one I've ever heard of either.
R:  No.  And -- yeah?
L:  But, ah, I know if I have a chest cold.  If I have a chest cold I know I'm prone to, ah, chest colds.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've never had pneumonia or anything like that but I know that there are people in my family that are prone to it, so I don't wanna take the chance so I'll go to the doctor's.
R:  What is a chest cold vers- versus a -- a different kind of cold?
L:  A chest cold is when you cough and your chest hurts. [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh.  Okay.
L:  You know?  Or else, you're bringing up a lot of phlegm. 
R:  No.  That's me.  That's what happens to me, um, um, before I -- I was -- I was start -- was prescribed Duratuss.  So, that's all I do is just, um, produce phlegm.  So, ad- -- but then that's not considered a cold though.  I don't know.  But -- and my chest doesn't hurt.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, I don't know about the doc- -- I never really go to the doctor for a cold. [inaudible]
L:  Well, l- like I say, if I have a chest cold and it's -- you know, and it's there a couple of days, or if I just really feel bad, then I'll -- you know, I'll go to the doctors so 
R:  Now, do you think you have less allergens in the, um, winter time and the fall --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- versus the summer?
L:  Yes.  Yes.  I don't have as much problem in the winter time.  I don't -- don't have so many problems in the winter time.  My problems start in late February, early March and it'll go through until mid September, first of, ah, October. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know.  But, that's most of the time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So 
R:  And -- and do you think because we -- sometimes in North Carolina we have freaky weather, like, f -- depending, you know, cold today, warm tomorrow that for --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- some people that -- that not -- you know, not have --
L:  Well I --
R:  -- having a constant temperature can cause a problem?
L:  It could be but then the -- the air is pollu- polluted because of all the cars and the emissions.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  You know.  So, um -- but I think it's gonna be better this year in a sense than last year because at least last year they had so much dust because of the drought.
R:  Mhm.
L:  This year things are gonna be a little damper, so people that suffer from mold and all they're gonna have more problems this year than they had last year.  
R:  [SIGH] That's true.  But, if you suffer from allergens like pollen and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- other type of, I guess, um, I guess things in the -- I guess, in the environment that w- w- with the lot of rain that we've been having, um, that makes it easier for those people because at --
L:  Right.
R:  -- least that rinses that stuff away, somewhat.
L:  Right, so   And, the air is cleaner because I su- -- I -- you know, we won't have those yellow days --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as they call it.  Won't have as many of those.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So 
R:  I do think the rain helps somewhat with a lot of --
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- a- allergens and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- stuff like that.
L:  But then in some places it's gonna be -- give people problems because a lot of people are gonna have problems with their roof, and then the roofs are gonna be where they may have leaked or where they got wet and they're not even aware of it.  And --
R:  Oh, re- --
L:  -- that's gonna develop mold.
R:  Ooh.  I -- I didn't even think of that.
L:  Right.  Because, see -- you know, so many people have had trouble, right?  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, if it rains -- well, when it rains so hard they had the problems but w- when it gets due to the regular rain they had no problems.  But see that mold is growing there.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Anyhow.  Even if they don't see the water coming down the mold will still be developing because if -- if there once then it will come back again.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Because you see that's -- that's just what my daughter just found out.  She only just, ah -- her walls get damp when it rains real hard --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and she didn't know it but she had mold behind when she took the paper down off the wall.
R:  Oh, the wall paper?
L:  Right.  When she took the wall paper down then she seen mold had grown behind the wall paper.
R:  [NOISE]
