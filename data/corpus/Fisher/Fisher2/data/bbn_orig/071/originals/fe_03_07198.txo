L:  Hi.  I'm Sohar[?].
R:  Hi.  I'm Nancy.
L:  Hi, Nancy.  How you doing?
R:  [LAUGH]  Good.
L:  [LAUGH]  Good.  So what are we supposed to talk about?
R:  If we have a lot of friends or just a few close friends and something about our best friend.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, um --
R:  So, you want to go first?   [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, um, I -- I have a few close friends.  I don't -- I don't have a lot of, uh, lot of friends and acquaintances.  I don't, um, I have to, like, get to know a person and, um, before I can, like, you know, open up and things like that so ...
R:  Yeah, and get personal.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  So I'm not -- I'm not the type of person that would I'll say [MN] get friendly with a bunch of people and not really know them.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't the time to begin with so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I totally understand that.  
L:  Yeah.  So you're also just have a few close friends?
R:  Yeah, just a few close ones, and it's so hard to find, like, five minutes to even talk to 'em and I have a best friend that I just called this weekend and, boy, we haven't talked [MN] forever just other than a email here and there.  It's just neither one of us has time.  It's so sad.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  I know.  I -- I just don't have the time.  I have a little -- little daughter so --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- she takes up pretty much all of my time, and it's hard to make friends.  Or it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- hard to meet people to, you know, for friendship because it's like, you know, what do you do?  You know.  I mean, with -- with other moms, with me, with other moms we all talk about kids.  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then after a while it just kinda gets [LAUGH] bor- it gets boring.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, like, okay.  
R:  I have three --
L:  How much more --
R:  -- little ones and I [NOISE] know exactly what you mean.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I can hear them in the [LAUGH] background.  
R:  You go sit down.  
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I try to, like, um, uh, you know, get together with people in my area, um, like mom's groups and things like that but that always end up being, um ...
R:  It's all about the kids.  You never have like --
L:  It's all about the kids.
R:  -- adult conversations.
L:  Right.  And then even that I just, uh, I mean, I don't know these people.  I can't really, like, you know, just because we all belong to the same group or something, I don't know.  I just -- I don't [MN] I don't seem to be able to, um, really, like, um, want to get to know them or, you know.
R:  I know exactly what you mean.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it' li- -- I feel like I'm in the same boat.  I have -- belong to a mother's of multiples, because I have a set of twins, and we get together and there's a lot of people that we have lots of things in common with but you still don't click on that level of friendship to where, you know, this is the person you're gonna call when you --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- have a bad day or you're stressed out or something.
L:  Exactly. 
R:  [LAUGH]  You're --
L:  +Exactly.
R:  -- not going to vent with this person.  You're -- unless it's about your children keeping you up or ...
L:  Exactly.  I know.  
R:  I know.
L:  Exactly.  And they probably have the same thing.  Like, "God, I don't want to hear it".  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You just don't have time to do like the fun friend things where you do things together and ...
L:  I know.  Like -- like when you were back in school, you know, like when you had friends and -- but, I mean, of course you don't do the same things that you did back then either.  You know, you don't want to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, before you used to get together and go out or whatever, and -- and now you can't do that.  Because you have a family.  You have kids.  It's kind of a different -- different, um, [NOISE] level.  And plus like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- um, some of my friends, um, are still single.  
R:  Yeah, and that's awkward --
L:  So that --
R:  -- isn't it?
L:  -- totally changes everything.  And even though everybody says, oh, no, no.  It's not gonna change just because you're getting married or just because you have a child.  But it does.  Because, I mean, they're in a different level.  They're in a different, uh, you know, time of their lives.
R:  In a different place.
L:  You know.  
R:  They have freedom that you wish you [LAUGH] had.  
L:  Exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They're still going out and trying to meet people and, you know, by the time they're all ready to go out I'm ready to go to sleep.  You know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, ain't that the truth.  And you're hoping for a full night's sleep.  And you're getting up early no matter what.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  You're not gonna sleep late on the weekends.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Exact- exactly.  There's nothing no -- no such thing as -- as that.  It's not like, oh, it's Friday night you can go out and then you can sleep in S- Saturday.  Well, no.  
R:  I [LAUGH] know.  
L:  The baby's --
R:  It doesn't.
L:  -- still [LAUGH] gonna get up at six am wanting --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- breakfast.  You [LAUGH] know.  
R:  Isn't that funny?  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, whoa.
L:  I know.  It's -- it's just it -- it totally changes everything.  So even those [MN] few close friends that I have they're still [inaudible] kind of, you know, they're still [inaudible] of, um, a little bit of a distance because, you know, I'm [MN] they're -- one of them is just getting married actually and, um, I'm [MN] -- I'm gonna throw her a bridal shower and she'll find out soon.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, she'll get it.
L:  What it's all [inaudible] like.  You know.
R:  We're looking at moving and I'm thinking my -- my ideal place to live would be a nice family neighborhood but where I could find a friend.  Something with more in common than just, you know, someone elses kids but someone in a close proximity --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that could be like a really good friend.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, that would be so neat 'cause you don't have -- we go to church and then I see people in passing, or whatever, but never [NOISE] like -- like never friendsh- -- oh, one of my two year olds just came in butt naked.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Is yours two yet?
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Is she two?
L:  Oh, my gosh my -- my phone.  Mine is fifteen months old.
R:  Oh, wait 'til she turns two.  
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, my word.
L:  Is that -- is that really true?  The terrible twos?
R:  You know with my first one it -- it wasn't.  Now she -- three [NOISE] was kind of an emotional roller coaster.  [NOISE]  Yeah.  But I have two year old twins, boy, girl.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my little girl, oh my word.  She draws on the walls.  She throws things in the toilet.  She's now totally naked.  I don't know where the diaper is.  
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  She does this, like, once a day.  Just 'cause she can, you know.  It's more or less, I thought, oh, she's ready to be potty trained and then I go find the diaper and it's not wet.  No --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it wasn't that it was just ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Gosh, I didn't even -- so she's -- she'll just take off her diaper?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, her pants and her diaper and just be naked and then --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And then you have to catch her before she does go to the bathroom but ...
L:  Well, my -- my daughter, what she does now, is just take off her -- she takes off her socks.  I mean, I -- I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- put -- yeah, I put her socks on and --
R:  Don't keep 'em on.
L:  -- if she doesn't have shoes they come right off.  And she usually does it in the car.  Maybe because she --
R:  Yeah, that's entertainment value, you know.
L:  Yeah.  And then, but I've seen her do it at home too and she'll just, uh, put on her shoes or something and -- and [MN] if I don't have her, like, you know, her shoes really tight [MN] uh, uh, she -- she will take them off and socks off and everything.  But she hasn't done the pants and the --
R:  See my --
L:  -- diaper thing yet.
R:  Yeah, my oldest one did that but it's like night after night lately.  All of sudden we'll notice she's [LAUGH] naked.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  I saw --
R:  Actually I just [MN] --
L:  -- one time, uh, at a -- in a mall at the, like the children area.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  One little girl just took off her little shorts and went back into the [LAUGH] into the play area and her mother was, like, oh, my gosh.  She was horrified, and she had another little one in her arms, and she ran after her and she's so funny 'cause she just took them off.  She just went up to her mom, took the pants off and before mom could do anything she went right back.
R:  That's when I can't do a thing.  But see -- yeah, and you tell people that and it's like I rely on my mom a lot.  [MN]  She helps me watch 'em and stuff when I need a backup.  If I get to tell her all this stuff and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I guess I would love to have a really close friend, my own age --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, you know ...
L:  Exactly.  The age thing too.
R:  That I could separate myself from this [LAUGH] all of it.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, 'cause, uh, like I -- I try to, uh, join this mom's group in my area and all the moms seem to be so much -- um, I guess they were much older than me.  I mean, we never really got to talk about the age but, um, it -- it just --
R:  Oh, yeah.  See that's kinda hard.  
L:  Yeah.  And they all --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- have like more than one kid and, um, I mean, they were really into the mom thing, you know.  [LAUGH]  That's all they talked about.  I mean -- I mean, that's -- that's what it is, I mean --
R:  I mean, like but I want this [inaudible].
L:  -- they -- they brought their cards over.  We would go to the play areas and stuff like that, and all we talked about were kids.  What they were wearing and the shoes and this and that.  And we --
R:  Where you got this.  Where you got that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know and then we never really got toge- got to talk about, um, just, you know, to get to know them.  And then they wanted to go to, like, bachelorette parties for, like -- there was one -- one woman in the, uh, group that [MN] she had kids and everything but she, uh, was getting married, and I never understood if that was, like, a second marriage or whatever.  But they were going to get together for a bachelorette party and I was just like I can't just get together with you guys and go and drink and whatever.  I mean, I don't even know you.  All we talk [LAUGH] about are kids, you know.  And now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for like one night the kids are not gonna be around, you know.  I don't know.  I just kind of felt weird about it.  But they seem to, you know, really like it.  And -- and they were part of the group for a lot longer than I ha- than I -- than I was, so ...
R:  It's hard -- it's just so hard.  I don't know what the deal is but it's hard.  We -- we did a mom's night out thing and that was fun.
L:  Yeah, that's exactly what that is.  Yeah.
R:  But when we all went out everybody just talked more about their kids.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  And it was like [NOISE] no we need to talk about other stuff.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  What book did you read?  You know, besides like --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] older.  
L:  Yeah, my husband suggested I, like, take a class or something and, you know, just, uh, that's how I would find a common ground with people.  And I'm like [MN] who has the time for that?  You know.
R:  Yeah.  It's hard.
L:  Classes are at -- I mean, I can't do it during the day 'cause I'm with the child and then at nighttime I, you know, I want to spend time with my husband as well.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And -- and truthfully, I mean, I'm sure you know that by nine o'clock, I mean, when I put her down I'm ready to go down myself.  You know.
R:  Oh, I'm telling you what.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And soon as I get these people in the bed, I'm like, okay.  Good night.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, cause it's -- it's such a challenge [LAUGH] to get 'em all in the bed but it's like, you know, the --
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]  You just live for sleep when you ... [NOISE]
L:  Is that gonna get difficult?  The putting in the bed thing as they grow older [LAUGH] or ...? 
R:  Um --
L:  When's it gonna get easier?
R:  Yeah.  It -- it got better with my older one.  I thought she would never, ever go to bed and then, um, she hit -- she hit five and it got a --
L:  Five?
R:  -- a lot easier.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Four was kinda rough.  Three was really rough.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Four was better than three.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, my God.  The terrible twos.  
R:  Yeah, let me tell ya.  Kids[?] ain't no fun.  My husband's gone and decided to put a diaper on the one who's diaperless.  
L:  [LAUGH]  So, yeah --
R:  He's just [inaudible].
L:  -- my -- my daughter is like my best friend right now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Isn't that funny?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's like, yeah, my five year old, I mean, we have these conversations because she's not one of my two year olds.  [LAUGH]  So she's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a five year old.  It's like I need a friend.  I need a friend [LAUGH] now.  
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  I mean, liking --
L:  That's what I tell my husband.  I mean, you know, she's it.  She's my -- she's my friend because she goes to places with me and she listens to me vent, even though my venting is usually about her.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, and like when you were in college, I don't know, I made friends pretty easily and I had a few really close friends and we just did so much together.  We lost touch, kind of, after college except for just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one of them.  But even now she's not married.  She's almost forty and she's ju-
