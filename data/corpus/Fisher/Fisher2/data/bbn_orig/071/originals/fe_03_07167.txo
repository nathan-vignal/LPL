L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Beth.
R:  Hi, my name is Jean.  
L:  Okay.  So we're discussing friends today or ...?
R:  Right.  That's what they -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  [several inaudible words] you have a very -- you have a lot of friends or, um, very close friends.  Not as many.
L:  Okay.
R:  Just a few.  That's what I thought I understood.
L:  Okay.  Um, I'd say I'm more of the person who has a lot, you know, a lot of casual acquaintances.  You know, for -- you know, actually though it's probably, you know, a lot of casual people and then a few close friends.  So ...
R:  And --
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  I'm the opposite.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?
R:  I have, uh -- I used to have, when I was in college, a lot of friends but --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- then when you get away from college you end up getting few close friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and those are the ones that ha- -- stick with you through whatever you go through.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's kinda, people move away.  Or you lose contact with people.  But I have, um, [MN] maybe about five close friends that I'm still in contact with.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  And, um, meaning you -- you -- you kind of go through different things with different people but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I'm -- I'm very lucky to have those close friends because those are people you can talk to, confine with, um, whatever [MN] tell them whatever problems you have.  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, I'd say, yeah.  I mean, there's always the friends that you have around that you know that you can talk to them about absolutely anything, you know.
R:  Mm.
L:  They're just always there for you, no matter what.  
R:  Right.
L:  And then there's the other people that are just, you know, they're to chat with at work or something.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  You don't really --
L:  Work friends.
R:  You don't really get too close with them because it's a different environment.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  Uh, I have some -- I did -- I do have one close friend that I used to work with and I no longer work with but we're really still close, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she doesn't live by -- she moved because of her job.  
L:  Okay.  Okay.  
R:  And, um, we -- we still keep in contact with.  In fact, um, I have her over for, like, holidays but she lives in Connecticut.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And she comes around du- -- different times of the year.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm very close with her and I do tell her a lot of different things that I don't share with, you know, certain people.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, um, um, basically, it's good to have that.  You grow from learning, you know, how you can talk and share with different people as you get older. 
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  But [NOISE] um ...
L:  Get different perspectives on different things.  
R:  Right.  Right.  But, you know, it's good to have a lot of friends but the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- close ones are the ones that you can rely on.  Um --
L:  Exactly.  They're the ones that actually ma- -- you know, really matter.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Not that the other ones don't matter.  
R:  Mm.
L:  But [LAUGH] you know, they're the ones --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know ... 
R:  Those are the ones that you, like, kind of [SIGH] depend on.  You know --
L:  Exactly.  
R:  -- you tell different -- you're not gonna tell them your whole -- you're gonna tell a certain friends up to a certain amount of things but then if they're close friend you gonna tell a little bit more.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  You know, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, that -- that -- you know, you have a lot of trust with that person too.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You grow with that person.  You have a lot of trust with that one particular person.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, and you don't tend -- you kinda get along better.  And you don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have any, um, hard feelings, like, you know, you just share --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a different, um, different stories with each other, you know.  
L:  [MN]  Exactly.  And then if you don't talk for like, you know, two weeks or something you're not offended.  You just --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, pick up where you left off.  And --
R:  Right.  And --
L:  -- you just move on.
R:  And they understand.  And ...
L:  Exactly.  'Cause you know, you're busy --
R:  That's --
L:  -- and things happen and ...
R:  Right.  And you just pick up where you left off.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  And --
L:  -- that's what they -- you know, [MN] -- you know, some friends, you know, I don't even talk to for like months and then all of a sudden you talk to 'em and talk like a three hour conversation.  
R:  Right. 
L:  And it's just like you -- you know --
R:  Like you never --
L:  -- you never -- 
R:  Right, you never ...
L:  -- left off.
R:  Right.  That's -- that's what I was gonna say.  The same thing.  And --
L:  [MN]  You know. 
R:  I have one friend that's like that and, um, she -- like we're trying to get together, um, 'cause she works full time, I work part time, and we're gonna try to get together during the summer but she'll --
L:  Ok- --
R:  -- come down to visit her family 'cause her family all live in, um, Jersey.  But she --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- lives in Connecticut so I email -- it's great with the emails because -- or going online --
L:  Su- yeah. 
R:  -- to talk.  And, um, but when you're in person it's better.  You can say more.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know.  But, uh, she's gonna be coming and we're trying to get a day though that she can -- my -- I have her and another friend, we're all gonna be, like, going out to eat or something like that.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And do something together.  How 'bout you?  Do you have anybody like that?  That you, you know, [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  [several inaudible words]  
R:  That somebody [several inaudible words].
L:  One particular friend?  Yeah, um, there's one friend I've had since I think it was, let's say, fifth grade so it's been quite a [LAUGH] while.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Fifteen, twenty years almost. 
R:  Right.  
L:  So ...
R:  That's good.  You know.  
L:  Yeah.  But I mean you need somebody who has known you, you know, when you were young and then, you know, you've grown up together.  
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  And --
L:  It's nice.
R:  -- it's -- it's -- and if you -- like I have this one friend that [MN] I grew up, like almost something like what you're saying.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, she's going right now through a divorce and we're gonna be going out during the summer, and she just finalized her divorce this past, um, February.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so she was looking up older frie- -- I mean, her older friends that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that she wanted to talk to and she goes, "You're the only one I can talk to.  The other ones don't want to hear me".  So --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [MN], you know.  So I'm gonna go see her too.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And [NOISE] that's about it.  [LAUGH]  With --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- close friends.  Um ...
L:  That's -- and I had one friend in England that is very strange.  We met, well, actually we became pen pals through, like, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Seventeen magazine or something.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And we've been talking, like, ever since we were, like, you know, twelve years old or something.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she came to visit me here in the States and everything and I haven't been to see her yet.  
R:  Wow.
L:  But, you know, we've just been talking back and forth and it's just the strangest thing that we've stayed friends for so long.
R:  Now, how --
L:  You know.
R:  How do you talk?  Do you talk through the internet?  Do you talk through writing?  Like [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- mostly writing?
L:  We usually email back and forth 'cause it's just easier with the time change and everything.
R:  Okay.  
L:  But then once in a while, you know holidays, we catch each other on the telephone.  And then we've been doing the, um, instant messaging online.
R:  Right.
L:  If we happen to catch each other.
R:  Right.  
L:  Which is kinda nice.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause it's so -- it's so easy and it's so much cheaper than calling. 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Oh, definitely.  One day they're gonna end that though.  I have a feeling they're gonna [MN] you know, start charging and -- all these emails and ...
L:  I know.  That's --
R:  They're gonna --
L:  -- gonna be the next thing.
R:  That's the next thing that they're gonna come up with and it's gonna be a little --
L:  But it's such a great --
R:  -- bit harder.
L:  Yeah.  It's such a great way to keep in -- keep in touch with people.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  
R:  Right.  And so easy.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  Very easy. 
L:  'Cause --
R:  As long as you a in- internet a- -- uh, email address, you're right there.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, um, I have, um -- I don't really have any penpal friends that I ever had, I mean something like that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've just had friends over the years that I met through either work or school or college or everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um ...
L:  You know, I don't really keep in touch with my college friends which is kind of odd.  But I guess, you know, you get involved with work and everybody's getting married and stuff, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just kind of lose touch.
R:  Different interests as they move on.  People move on so ...
L:  Yes.  'Cause it's just such a, you know, it's a -- such a diverse group of people just all brought together in that little area for a [inaudible] years and then everybody goes back to their lives.
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  So ...
R:  And, um, at work you meet a whole different group of people but sometimes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't really, um, you know, I met one p- -- a couple, two girlfriends that I still keep in touch with.
L:  Okay.
R:  But one is really, really -- I'm really close with and we've been friends for, uh, like almost twenty years but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that's the one that moved to -- to Connecticut --  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- for a different type of job.  
L:  Okay.
R:  So she moved out of the area but we still -- it's good that we still keep in touch.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, um, the only thing is, like, she's not married, she's single, so -- and, um, she's living in with a guy and it's just a-- we have two different types of lives but we still [NOISE] oh, sorry.  We still have --
L:  Oh, that's okay.
R:  We still get together and we still talk, you know.  We still talk --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- about what we done in the past and have a couple of laughs, you know, and thinking of what we did, and I actually met her through work and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- it's always -- it's always good to keep -- even though you start cha- -- I mean, you -- as you grow older you like, oh God, things are breaking down [LAUGH] in my body.  Like what -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what -- gain of weight or, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something crazy's going on with our health.  You know, you --you always got things to talk about.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, yeah.  But it's good to at least share them with somebody that's, like, gonna make you feel better.  [LAUGH]  Instead of --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- make you feel worse.  
L:  Like, yes --
R:  So ...
L:  -- I have a cellulite too so, you know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [several inaudible words].  Exactly.
R:  Yep.  
L:  [MN]
R:  It's -- friends are always -- I have this other girlfriend that used to live in my town and she never owned a house and she has kids, and she always wanted to have a hou- -- her own house but she couldn't live around this area because it's very expensive.  So --
L:  Oh, ok- --
R:  -- she had to -- she had to move out of this area.
L:  Okay.
R:  And her son was the same age as
