L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Anne.
L:  Hi, my name's Shmila[?].  I'm trying to think right now of, um, a corp- --
R:  Can you hold on one second?  I'm sorry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hold on.
L:  No, it's okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sorry.  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  That's all [LAUGH] right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I can't even -- my brain is fried.  I --
R:  I know.  This is a pretty hard subject.  The last one I did wasn't so complicated 'cause it's just, I guess, they're talking about like scandals like the Martha S- Stewart scandal and stuff.  Is that what you're assuming they're getting into?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I guess that's a good one.  Yeah, I hadn't even thought.  I mean, I hadn't even thought of that one.  But, yeah, that's -- that's probably what they're -- they're talking about.  Stuff like that.
R:  And I really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't see how they can prevent it.  I mean, [MN] I -- I mean, until they get caught or do something stupid I don't see any preventative +measure.  I mean, I don't think there's anyway to prevent what she did or what, you know, other CEOs do in their companies at all because [MN] they're embezzling and you don't know someone's embezzling until they do it.
L:  Until they've been caught.  Right.  They only thing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I can think of is if they've got some sort of system in place, in terms of, like, checks and balances.  You know.  And if you've got the hierarchy of, like, the CEO instead of having, like, one major person that's in charge of everything and then breaking it down and -- and after, like, having the CEO and then having it break -- broken down.  Like, if you're looking at a triangle and having them be, like, the point --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on top.  You know, having more --
R:  But a lot of ti- -- yeah.  But a lot of times when you're watching it, it is the triangle that's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- involved.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  The -- like, the head person's blaming the corner of the triangle and the other person's blaming the [LAUGH] other corner and ...
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, yeah.  So it's --
L:  Yeah so unless -- unless you -- unless they can come up with some sort of, like, advisory boards, like along --
R:  Someone on the outside.
L:  Yeah.  Along the way.  Yeah.  That's not inner -- that's not, um, involved in it.  You know, from the inside looking outside perspective.  It's not so bias.  
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  I really -- I really don't know.  Because you're right.  Like until it's too late [LAUGH] the evidence comes out once it's already kind of too late.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?  So while it's happening obviously no one's aware of it because if they were aware of it it wouldn't be happening, so ...
R:  Yeah.  Like our --
L:  Kind of a catch twenty two.
R:  Right.  'Cause I work for the city and, um, like, the finance department.  I mean, we're totally audited and that's from an outside company coming in, you know, and doing it, and I think maybe that's the way the government could do it.  They could have people from the government coming in and auditing but that's gonna cost taxpayers more money to, you know, to fund people from the government to come in and, you know ...
L:  Absolutely.  I mean, they could have -- they need to have some sort of, like, sporadic checking.  You know.
R:  Right.
L:  Even if it's like -- if it's regular checking then people would just figure out the system and then beat the system again.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So it would have to [LAUGH] -- it would just have to be something sporadic.  What city are you in?
R:  Well, I live in, um, Riverside, Cali- like Riverside County.
L:  Oh.  [MN] 
R:  Where -- where do you live?
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They really connect people out of the state, huh?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I know.  It's really far out there.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  Where's, uh -- what's -- where -- where's Riverside County?
R:  Um, like, in Southern California.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right. 
R:  So we're ou- out here and swimming.  It's hot.  So hot today.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You're so lucky.  It's been raining here nonstop for two weeks.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Well, it's better than sweating to [LAUGH] death.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, this is gonna be a hard subject to, like, talk for ten minutes on because of the whole fact that it's -- I don't think there's really, really any way to prevent something like that.  You know, Martha --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Stewart's claiming, you know, for example, "I didn't do it.  I didn't do it".  Well, you know, you got caught doing it and so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, it's really hard.  I mean, kind of like the whole -- I know this doesn't really pertain but, like, Sammy Sosa and the baseball.  You see with it being whatever inside, are you going to go through every single baseball players bat now and crack it open and then have your -- you know, how do you prevent anything until it actually happens?  
L:  Right.  I mean, someone's hand gets caught in the cookie jar and then, like I said, uh, by that time it's too late.  You know.
R:  Way too late.  Yeah.
L:  And then -- and then they want to -- you know, you wa- -- you don't want to see like how much time and money and effort do you want to expend, you know, [MN] in the meantime trying to catch people, where that time and money can be expended somewhere else?  You know.  
R:  Right.
L:  If -- if it's all about, like, everyone, sort of, being spies on each other because we're all think that someone else is gonna sell us out and, like, ruin our businesses then, you know, we could live that way.  It'd be a horrible way to live but also I don't think we have the energy or the money or the funds to live that way.  You know.
R:  No.  We don't.
L:  But, I don't know.  
R:  And --
L:  I really don't know.  It's -- I -- I cannot even begin to fathom an answer.  
R:  No, I can't either to be honest with you, 'cause it's just way, way -- about such a [SIGH], I don't know.  Like you said, it's just -- it's hard.  It's like you just don't know.  I mean, look at the agents, you know, representing the music companies.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I mean, they're embezzling, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars and these people that they trust.
L:  Right.  
R:  And then --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- you know, they end up stealing and they have to take it almost to like a civil court.  There's nothing anyone can do about it. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  It's like -- it's just the way of the world.  It sucks.  And, you know, it's just people if -- [MN] there's not good people out there that would do that, and embezzle and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's just, you know, it's terrible.  You just don't know who to trust, when to trust 'em or, you know ...
L:  I know.  I mean, unless they operated -- unless we operated our entire system and made it like this utopian world where we weren't even using money and [LAUGH] doing everything --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- through like a barter [LAUGH] system.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Then --
R:  That'd be nice.
L:  -- may- -- [LAUGH] then maybe we could, like, work our way to something like that but in terms of, like, us using cash dollars and stuff like that.  I really [MN] the -- it's too -- we're in too deep already.  It sounds so pessimistic but I really don't know what else to say about it, you know.
R:  No, I don't either.  'Cause this, you know, you know, you're right on as far as all that stuff goes and everything.  So ...  But, yeah, it's -- it's definitely interesting and I don't think the government could stop it to be totally honest.  No matter --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, how -- I don't think so.  I just don't.
L:  [MN]
R:  There's always around everything.
L:  Absolutely.  What is it that you do?
R:  I just work for the city in the office so ...  Just an office assistant.  Do you work or ...?
L:  Yeah, I work, um, I work in the mental health field.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.  I work with severely mentally ill, um, clients.  
R:  Ew.  Ew -- 
L:  And --
R:  -- that it'd be hard.
L:  -- go round to different houses.  It's actually not very -- everyone says it's, you know, it would be really hard but it's actually not very hard.  It's actually really -- it's -- it's much -- I worked in offices before and it's much more difficult for me to work with, um, quote m- mentally stable, uh, suit and tie people.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Than it is -- than it is for me to work with, uh, the clients that I work because at least they're like so ...  They're like children in a way that they're so honest and not jaded.  You know.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- at least you're --
R:  That's true.
L:  You're dealing with, like, a -- an honest population rather than like a political population, which I'm not very good at, so ...
R:  Yeah, 'cause through our city we have like a program where they all meet.  Like once a week all the different homes that they have.  And they come and they meet and they do like crafts and da- -- they have dances and all kinds of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really neat stuff like that.  So that's kind a cool for 'em.  
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  That stuff, but ...
L:  -- is cool.
R:  But, yeah --
L:  That is cool.
R:  But, I don't know.
L:  I'm curious after, um, I'm actually working right now.  I'm curious.  After I get off the phone I'm gonna go inside and ask them and see what kind of answer they come up 'cause I'm sure they [LAUGH] would have some sort of answer to it.  Probably way better than ours.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Way.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- yeah, I just -- I'm not even -- you know, this is my -- my second time I've done this.  I'm not even quite sure exactly what they want or anything.
L:  I know.  What was your first question that you got?
R:  Um, [LAUGH] oh my God, I can't even remember.  I can't even --
L:  My first one was so easy.  It was basically [MN] and the woman I was talking to, we were on the same page.  It was, you know, what do you think about the war in Iraq?  [LAUGH]  And it was just too easy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That one was -- no, I don't e- -- you know, I can't even re- -- oh, my God, this is terrible.  I cannot remember what my first question was.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I think -- oh, it had to do with, um, the internet.  [MN]  Children on the internet.
L:  Mm.
R:  And the lady I was talking to was two years -- [MN] she only had a two year old and I have someone who's graduating so we had completely different perspectives of the whole thing.  Like --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, are they really necessary in the world and everything like that?  And her --
L:  Right.
R:  -- opinion was way different from mine so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because she hasn't had a child that's had to go through it yet, but ...
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  But, hopefully, my son wants to be some CEO of a company, so hopefully he'll be an honest one but ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  You don't know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, you never know.  It just [MN] -- people get greedy.  They're just so, so --
L:  U- unfortunately.
R:  -- greedy out there.  And that's --
L:  I know.
R:  -- the only reason why they do it.  It's the greed.  
L:  I know it is.  It's absolutely taken back by the greed, which is really sad.  Very, very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sad.  
R:  I mean, they make millions of dollars a year and that's just still not [MN] --
L:  But it's not enough.  
R:  It's not --
L:  It's not enough.
R:  Never.  No one -- no one's ever happy.  No one's ever satisfied.  It's just unbelievable.  So ...
L:  Mm.
R:  But [SIGH] so ...  Oh, God, this is a hard one.  Definitely.  It's a hard subject to talk about so ...
L:  I agree. 
R:  I know.  It's ten minutes, huh?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  All right.  Let's see how we can ...  Uh, just -- God, I don't know.  I -- I -- I don't know -- even know anymore answers or how to prevent it or how to -- how to caught, you know, cure it or ...  [LIPSMACK]  I don't know.
L:  How did you hear about the study anyway?
R:  Um, I think my sister in law sent it to me through, like, the internet and I just signed up.  Because we do, um -- there's other things out here that -- like you can go to a restaurant and get paid to eat and stuff. 
L:  Mm.  That's so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- fun. 
R:  Yeah.  So there's like a whole bunch of stuff out here like, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, like they'll give us, like, thirty bucks to go to a -- to go eat and then ten dollars to fill out the form.  So you're --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- actually, like -- yeah, it's really cool.  So she's like, "Oh, here, try this".  I'm like, "Okay, I'll try it".  And I didn't, you know, like I didn't think anything of it and then I just got a call, like, a few --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- weeks ago so ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But I'm not even [MN] -- like I said, I'm not even positive how it's all [several inaudible words] 
L:  Set up by now.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know.  I'm still kind of thinking that it's a big huge scam and they're, like, just taping our voices because it's some, I don't know, cloning thing.  I'm --
R:  Really?  Do you?
L:  No, I really --
R:  Well, I haven't --
L:  No, I real-
