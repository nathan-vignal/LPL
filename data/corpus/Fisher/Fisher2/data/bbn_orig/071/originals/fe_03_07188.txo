L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello there.  This --
R:  Hi, this is Jean.
L:  This is Lou, from Cleveland, Ohio.  How are you?
R:  Hi, Lou.  I'm from Andover, New Jersey.
L:  Oh, from New Jersey --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- the garden state.
R:  [LAUGH] Yup. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  That's --
R:  Hold on just a minute, I'm getting some static, lemme --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- change the channels. [NOISE]
L:  Okay. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sorry about that, Lou.
L:  No problem.
R:  So, ah, we're supposed to talk about friends.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And, ah, if -- if we're the type of people who have a lot of friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or -- or and acquaintances or just a few close friends.
L:  That's an interesting subject.  You know, I -- I really -- I can actually say, i- in my line of work, mm, the friends I have are the -- my clients, really -- I'm a hairdresser.
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
L:  So, yeah, [MN] especially in that line of work, it's kind of like, we're psychologists besides being hairdressers, you know --
R:  Yup.
L:  -- you -- you talk to people so much and -- and, you know, y- you had friends in high school -- and -- yeah, I'm fifty five so I look -- I -- in retrospect, I look back and see the friends I have in high school, I don't have friends like that any more.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, like, my wife is my best friend.  You know --
R:  Well, my husband is my best friend too.  I have to --
L:  And then you have your children and I have grandchildren, so it's kinda like, you know, between work, your family and things like that, you know, I don't socialize.  My social life is my -- we own our own business, we're both hairdressers, so, you know, that's our social life.  Those are our friends and the other friends are our family, you know, and it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kinda like family and friends are the same thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause you get --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- son in laws and daughter in laws --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and then, you know, they're family, but then they're friends because they're not blood, you know, it's kind of like -- it was an interesting thing.  I was thinking about it as it came up, er, "Do I have any friends?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  N- no.  You know, like, somebody you call up and just shoot the breeze with -- no --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not really.  [MN]
R:  Well, I --  I don't know if that's -- that's more, um, you know, typical of males, ah, because it -- it seems, like, you know, ah, for instance, my husband, ah, works so much and then he has friends that he has, um, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, developed over the years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, as -- as -- as part of his interests.  Like, right now, he's up in Canada fishing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, he picked up those friends because he thought, um, he might like to do that and he liked tho- -- you know, those guys as -- as company --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, he -- he doesn't do it every year, but -- but -- but those guys that he goes fishing with are not the guys that he would, you know, ah, go over and talk to if he had a problem --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or anything like that either, you know, so, um, I don't know if that's, you know, typical -- typically male or what.  But, um --
L:  I guess it takes men a long time to build, you know, confidence in another --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- male.  You know ...
R:  Well, you know, then on the other hand, ah, we have, um, a -- some friends, ah, that we, ah, met in our last home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we really enjoy their company, you know, as -- as -- as a couple --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so we -- we get together, you know, a lot and I consider, ah, Dee, ah, you know, one of my best friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, and yet he, Ewey[?] has a lot of friends, people that, you know, he knows that he shoots the breeze with, um, you know, because he grew up in that town.
L:  Mm.
R:  Now, I -- now I don't know if he, you know, if he had a problem, I don't think that he would, you know, go over that person's house and talk to them about it, or something like that.  But, you know, I don't know if -- if that is what men call friends, you know, I would call those very good -- well, they're more than acquaintances though, I don't know.
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know.
L:  -- somebody once told me the definition of a friend is someone you can without hesitation, in a snow storm, call three o'clock in the morning and say your car has broke down and you'll have no doubts that that person will be there.
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's the definition of a friend. [MN]
R:  Well, I -- I, you know, when I was growing up, I had, um, one really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good high school friend.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I had a lot of other, um, you know, friend -- people that I called friends, that, you know, I might have hung out with a little bit, or anything, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, Joanie was my closest friend --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I only had one close friend and then in college I had a couple of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- close friends.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- u- unfortunately, we've lost touch -- touch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, over the years, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so and -- and I was bemoaning that fact, because my husband, as much as he's a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- male and males don't, you know, hold on to friends like that, he still has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- his college, you know, couple of his college friends.
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that are, you know, good friends, and -- and I don't have mine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and -- and it's not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I'm, um, a shy violet or anything -- I'm -- I'm, you know, I'm a people person, I'm very talkative --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything like that.  I don't know, but I -- I don't think that I could handle a whole bunch of friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it t- -- it -- it -- you know, because I put a lot of energy into it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it would just suck me dry. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know. 
L:  Well --
R:  Ah, ri- right now, I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two, ah, of my closest friends that -- that I was thinking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm fifty three now --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, now that I'm ha- -- over half a century old --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I was thinking, "God, if either one of -- if anything happened to either one of tho- -- them, I don't think I could be happy again --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- for the rest of my life".  You know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  I mean it would just -- it would just kill me to lose either one of them and ea- each one of them feeds me in a different way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Um, one of them is my, um -- both of them are very intelligent, um, ah, but one of them feeds my intellect more and the other one just keeps me happy.  Although she's -- she could talk on any subject too. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But she -- she is the kind of person that you could never be depressed abo- -- around, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean she -- she would -- not that she would, you know, make you laugh your way out of it, she's just -- she just has such a -- a positive spirit, you know.
L:  Zest for life, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that you -- you just can't get down about anything around her.  You know, she's just so -- so, um, infused with life, God. [LAUGH] You know.
L:  [several inaudible words] it's fun to be around people like that.
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  Yeah --
R:  I -- I love them both.  Like, I couldn't do without either -- either one of them though, you know. 
L:  Mhm.  My daughter had an interest -- had -- she's a very, ah, people person, but she cannot find friends that have the same values.  You know, she's m- -- she's married and has two little children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and to her the whole world revolves around her children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and other couples alike with children and if they're -- don't have the same values, she has difficulty relating to 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, she -- you know, th- they go to Disneyla- -- ah, world with another couple and while you're at Disneyworld, you're in Florida, and basically it's for children and they're geared [NOISE] -- they have two two year olds with them [NOISE] and they were trying to do things [NOISE] for the daughter, while the other one they were there, like, on, you know, they got their twelve pack of beer and they wanted to go and relax [NOISE] and have their vacation.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, and my daughter just couldn't relate to 'em.  You know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then there's -- there's so many other, you know, when she -- she was a flight attendant and, you know, she enjoyed her job being with people and she said, "You know, most of them, all they wanted to do is party and nobody was interested in taking care of, you know, the -- the -- the people on the airplane, you know, and -- and having a good time at work.  They were all worried about where they were going and what they were doing that night, instead --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- of, you know".  And it was -- you know, and it's basically the way, you know, her mother and I are too, you know, you have a good time at your job and then, you know, [MN] enjoy your work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it --
R:  Well, that -- that, you know, that -- that kind of explains why I don't have as many close friends as an adult --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I -- I have, um, a lot of, um, values that -- and -- and as soon as I find out other people don't have those values then they real- -- I can't really relate to them.
L:  Right, it's -- it's --
R:  You know.
L:  -- real hard.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and I, you know, I was brought up in a, you know, what might be called old fashioned by the kids today, ah, household, where, ah, you try your very best, you have, ah, you know, respect for people and their property and you have, ah, you know, respect for morality and authority and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is it -- you know, I'm a teacher and the kids today are so, ah, they have no respect for authority, they're, you know, and their parents are --
L:  Same thing.
R:  -- let them get away with it because, you know, years ago if, ah, I -- I was never really in trouble in school, I was a little, you know, brown nose, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, but if I had ever got into trouble in school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you knew that you were in really serious trouble and they didn't wanna hear your side of it, they didn't wanna hear their explanation, if a teacher called and said that you did something wrong, that was it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was good enough for th- -- you know.  It -- and -- and the kids today, you know, the parents come in and said, "Well, you know, my kids said, that you bla, bla, bla, bla, bla bla bla --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and it -- it --
L:  They question you.
R:  -- yeah, it -- it -- for instance, if -- if their kid cursed in school, and I called their parents, the parents come back and say, "Well, you must have said something", and it's like, "Excuse me". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I mean, [LAUGH] you know, ah, so I -- I --
