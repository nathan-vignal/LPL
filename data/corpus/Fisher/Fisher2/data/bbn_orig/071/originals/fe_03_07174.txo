L:  Hello.
R:  H- hello.
L:  Hello, I'm Jeannie.
R:  And I'm Bernice.
L:  Bernice, pleased to meet you.  This is very interesting, isn't it?
R:  This is the first time I'm doing this.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And also myself.  It's been, um, I'm very curious.  Um, and I'm gla- I'm glad we have such a great topic as friends.  Um, do you have several friends or do you hold just a few dear?
R:  Uh, a few dear.  
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah.  What about --
L:  I -- I find myself too doing that.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think that it's easy to have lots of acquaintances and lots of people that you know in a social atmosphere, but I think when you go to share your, um, personal things or want to -- someone to bear some of [LAUGH] your energy or lack of energy it seems to be friends or dear family.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You think?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Do you have brothers and sister?
R:  Uh, yeah, I've got three brothers.  
L:  And do you --
R:  And --
L:  -- consider them like they're friends too?
R:  Um, probably more when I was growing up.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, than -- than now.  'Cause we don't live that close --
L:  Yeah, [MN].
R:  -- you know.  What about you?
L:  That tends to happen.  I actually was raised, uh, away from my family in a -- a private school so I didn't really get to grow up with -- with a family atmosphere so, I think that's why I tend to have [MN] hold my friends very tightly for --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- many, many years.  I've had friends since I -- and that I've known since I was, you know, twelve -- eleven and twelve years [LAUGH] old.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've got several of those too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you have a -- do you prefer w- women friends or guy friends?
R:  Women. 
L:  Women.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I think I tend to have with -- I was just talking with a friend the other day and I -- and she and I both seemed to, um, have more guy friends and I don't know why.  It just, uh, because I -- I -- I guess it's just [MN] maybe growing up in an all girls' school I became closer to guys because of the competition in girls.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  I only went to an all girls' school, um, when I was in junior high.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  That's a difficult time to ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I think. 
L:  Um, well, um, who is your best -- what is your best -- who would you choose as your best friend?  Would you -- do you have --
R:  Um ...
L:  What is her name or [inaudible]?
R:  That -- that's hard to tell because, yeah, I have --
L:  They have different depths of personality?
R:  Y- yeah.  And -- and different lengths of time and, um, you know, that I've known them, um, you know, like I'm living in Florida now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we've lived here, oh, about thirty years but, you know --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- I still have friends from New York.  You know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that I grew up with but we really don't share the every day things.
L:  [MN]
R:  We just share the milestones together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Or when you're -- when you're together you -- it's like no time has lapsed in between?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Like I know that if, you know, I ever needed to, you know, I could call them. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  But ...
L:  And -- and I think the wonderful thing too about the internet or having is to email and -- where before, you know, is -- is you did call but now you can email or you can tell that everybody know what's going on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at the same time. 
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It seem --
R:  How did you find about, um --
L:  The program?
R:  -- yes, the program.  Yeah.
L:  Actually I seen an ad and I thought, well, I'm going to look into this.  Um, I -- I live in Tennessee --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I'm from California and, um, I've been here about, oh, going on five years, but my friends in California are like my soul mates.  I have -- I mean, it's like they can tell just by my voice how upset I am or how --
R:  Oh, [MN].
L:  -- lonely I am.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or we -- it's almost a psyche thing you know.  It's like family.  It's just that they can -- when I'm [MN] -- when they don't hear from me for a little while then they know something's wrong.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  But, um, um, [COUGH] yes, when I, um -- but coming here the people are very different.  And like you were saying New York and Florida are very different types of, um, uh, personalities of people, 'cause New York is very -- is I -- I think of New York City -- is that where you're from?
R:  Um, the Bronx.
L:  The Bronx.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  It's a very rushed environment up there, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, everyone's on the go.  Down here it's more, um, it's gotten more like New York but when we first came down it was very laid back and --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- um, you know, like it -- for us it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like -- in -- in New York you would go in, let's say, to the bank or the grocery store and you just, you know, go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in line and you do your business and whatever.  Down here you have a conversation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with, you know ...  But --
L:  Yes.  Everybody's very warm and greets you and friendly and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and honestly interested in [MN] in -- in, um, returning compliments and such, huh?
R:  Right.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like [MN] you know, here, you know, [MN] the bank I go to, you know the tellers.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you -- you see --
L:  But that's wonderful.  Isn't that -- I mean, I -- I -- I know my -- my boyfriend lived in New York and he loved it but I -- I -- that's how I picture New York, as being more business, more straight and -- and such.  And -- and California.  While here in Tennessee, in Nashville, it's very friendly, but I also think I came into a town knowing a lot of people before I moved here so I had friends establ- -- or acquaintances established. 
R:  Well, that must help.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It helped me.  It helped me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think -- but I love going places that are new and people asking, "Hi, how are you?"  Or commenting or complimenting you because they're honestly being polite.  I mean, they're -- they're not just being polite because that's their job.  They're being polite because that's their personality.
R:  Right.
L:  I think --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sunshine has a lot to do with [LAUGH] it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I think it does also.  
L:  [LAUGH]  I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's very easy to -- to go to -- want to go back to the same stores, the same gas stations, the same places because you see those familiar places and they're very com- -- they're familiar faces and they're very comforting. 
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, [COUGH] when I haven't been in a store for a while, maybe because I'm working different hours or something, but they'll say, "Well, I haven't seen you here for a long time".  Or[?] "I haven't seen you for a couple of weeks", especially on the holidays.  And it makes me feel --
R:  Right.
L:  -- good that they missed me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.  And --
L:  And --
R:  -- um, we were going to a bank, you know, for years and years and they knew the whole family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was like they knew my son was moving in with a roommate before I even said anything because the roommate was there with -- with his mother and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was like, you know, everybody knew what, you know --
L:  And they cared.
R:  -- everyone.  Yeah.
L:  They cared.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's really ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- I think that's what makes it -- that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's make our -- living in our country such a wonderful thing and that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And our friendships.  And I think our generation of people have become more dependent on friendships more than just family.
R:  Yes.  Because everybody's moving.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When I grew up it was, you know, family was close by.  
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  And people stayed in the same jobs until they retired and -- and the trans- transient situations were not real common with -- people are now -- people can have three or four different types of jobs in a lifetime and --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so they do move on or move in different places.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I, um, [COUGH] -- and how many children do you have?
R:  I have two.
L:  Have two.  Boy and a girl?
R:  Uh, two boys.
L:  Oh, two boys.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I have --
R:  You said you have a boyfriend?
L:  Oh, yes.  I was m- I was married, um, for twenty four years.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  And then I went through a divorce, and I have a boyfriend now and he, uh, surprisingly isn't in the music industry.  I actually was not in the music industry.  I was in radio and came into, uh, the Nashville area and was working on a project but I went through a divorce and [COUGH] my children were all fairly grown or fairly [MN] well, uh, well on their way of doing their own thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, and my friends are very supportive, and it was a real hard thing for me to go through this.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  And, um, but, um, to keep our family on even ground it was important that I not know everything that was going on in his life 'cause it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It broke my heart.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And -- and I -- and -- and -- and it was better for me.  And in fact his m- his mother is my mom.  I call her mom.  And she was -- she's been my mother since I was sixteen years old so I --
R:  Oh.
L:  She's my mom. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And, um, and so -- and my children grew up with a lot of the same people around them and same family and, uh, um, [COUGH] church, uh, the different churches that we've attended.  They've, uh, just been well accepted and -- and, uh, and I think their friendships, in fact, it's really important that they have strong friendships.  Even though they have strong family relationships with each other they have, uh, strong friendships outside our family.  
R:  And they're with you in Tennessee?
L:  No.  They are all in, um, three of -- uh, two of them are in California.  Um, my daughter.  My youngest and my middle -- and my second son.  And then my -- I have one -- the oldest son is in Arizona and he's married.  And, uh, then I have a son who i- is presently -- his home is in, uh, New Orleans but he is an underwater diver and medic.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And he travels around.  And, uh, they were [COUGH] they were all -- my daughter, I think, was, um, [LIPSMACK] nineteen when we got the divorce.
R:  Oh.
L:  [COUGH]  So ...
R:  Well, that's hard. 
L:  Yes.  
R:  [several inaudible words]. 
L:  But it -- but it's okay 'cause they're okay.  They're -- they're -- they -- it wasn't a bad thing.  It was a hard thing but it wasn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it -- it happened and -- and everything is okay.  I just came here because I had an opportunity to work with a project.  And [COUGH] my friends felt [COUGH] and -- and the people I met here had opened their arms and
