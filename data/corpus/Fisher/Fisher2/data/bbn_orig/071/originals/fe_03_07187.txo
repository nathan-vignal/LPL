R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Lisa from Solana[?], Kansas.  
R:  I'm Judy from New Jersey.  How do you do?
L:  Well, it's nice to meet you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You too.  [LAUGH]  These things are crazy.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, 'course I haven't received a check yet but ...
L:  Neither have I.   [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  That's what the last girl told me too.  Somebody said it's at the end of the month.  
L:  Good.  [LAUGH]  Well, I guess, the topic is, um, friends.  Um ...  [LAUGH]  I, um, I guess I'm the type of person who has a few friends.  I don't have very many.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, most of my acquaintances are just through work.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  You work everyday?
L:  Yes, I work, uh, Monday through Friday.  Eight to five.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I, pretty much, I don't have much of a social life.  I'm a parent of an eight month old so ...
R:  [MN]  You lucky person.  
L:  Yeah.  So I don't have a whole lot of socializing in my life right now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  But the time will come. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If you're work ing too.  You can't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can't possibly have the time --
L:  No.
R:  -- for both.  Actually, well, I'm much older and my children are grown.  
L:  Okay.
R:  So I'm in a totally different position but, um, I've been sick.  I was very sick when my kids were little and a lot of my friends backed out on me as I got sick, like if they could catch it.  Um ...
L:  Oh.
R:  So I have very -- you know, several close friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where, when I was younger and your age I had a lot of -- a lot of -- you know, a big circle.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But mostly through, like, I was -- when my kids were little their friends, I was active in, um, fundraising organizations, which I'm getting active in now, and my friends were then through that.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  Um, I don't think you need a lot of friends in life.  [MN]
L:  You know, I think all you need are a few really close friends that you can lean on whenever you, um, you know, need -- need an ear to talk [LAUGH] to.  
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, a lot of friends just seem to be get very superficial.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  When it's a -- 
L:  I agree.
R:  -- a lot.  That's what I notice of people.  You know, like, I have a friend that ha- -- a very, very close friend who has more friends than anybody knows what to do with.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But most of them, which I never realized before, are more superficial.  They're not -- they're one or two close friends.
L:  Yeah, I notice that.
R:  And she's a good person.  She's a great person.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, the rest are, you know, you see, you talk to.  Um, I happen to be one of her very close friends but they're not like I thought they were.  I thought she was close -- very close with all of them --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all these years and now I'm finding out that's not so.  
L:  Well, it's really ironic today that, um, that I got this call because out of the blue [LAUGH] I've been out of, um, I've been out of high school for fifteen years.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  And, um --
R:  Gee, I wish I could say that.
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I got an email today from somebody I went to high school with --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for the first time.  And I haven't talked to him in fifteen years.
R:  That is great.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, I registered with that classmates dot com.  
R:  Oh, +yeah.  [MN]  Did you pay for it?
L:  No, I'm -- I'm just a regular free [inaudible].
R:  That's what I did too.  But I was wondering if in order to get someone's email don't you have to --
L:  I think so.
R:  -- actually pay?
L:  I think you do.  
R:  So I wonder how they got your email?
L:  Well they must -- they must've paid.  He must've became a [inaudible].
R:  He must've have paid.  Right.
L:  And, uh -- it was just really weird.  I mean, it was a guy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And I went out with him one [LAUGH] time.  
R:  How interesting.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And so he reminisced a little bit about his -- his -- his achievements and asked if I had, you know, wanted to, you know, get to talk around -- talk to him more and it's weird because we're kind of in, well the same, um, location as far as the country of the United States, but he's down in Texas and I'm down -- I'm up here in Kansas.
R:  Right.  
L:  And so [LAUGH] you know, I don't go to Texas anymore because my folks moved away so, um, I -- it was just really interesting getting to talk to somebody again from Texas and ...  I don't know.
R:  That is inter- -- it's nice.  You know, it's funny.  I'm what's called -- I -- I do some work and I was on the internet one day and somebody emailed me [MN] emailed everybody that does this kind of work and said I want to know something about a company and what company goes to them.  And I wrote back, and usually I just sign these letters my email address. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And instead I signed it my -- as if I was writing to a company, my name, my address, my [MN] telephone number, the whole bit.
L:  Wow.
R:  Well, it +ended up, she wrote back to me.  Did you go to Newton[?] High School?  I'm originally from Massachussetts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I said, yes.  And this went back and forth.  And her name was Margie.  And [inaudible] who do I know from Newton named Margie?  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I said it can't be.  It was my best friend from high school's wife.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And so, of course, he was playing me along and kept telling her to write to me.  Now we've seen each other several times since.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  It's about two years ago.  It was the greatest thing that ever happened.
L:  Oh, that is so neat.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And it -- I mean, you know, and like everytime we're together we just look at each other.  Good God this is +great.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know and same type of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know I wish there was a place on the internet you could go into and really find email addre-
L:  Hello?  Well, looks like I'm gonna get to talk to myself for the rest of the time.  I think we were disconnected.  But, um, one thing I wanted to add to this conversation is that, um, speaking of friends, um, several of my friends happen to be my neighbors and, um, they are elderly or semi retired.  I live in a -- an [MN] an established, um, area and there's a lot of, um, retirees.  Most of them are, um, widows and so, um, I've kind of adopted several of my, um, adopted grandparents and I go visit 'em frequently and I take my little eight month old with me, and I really enjoy spending time with them because I learn a lot about the past.  Especially, you know, events that I never got to experience in my life that I wished I had.  It's just interesting to see it through somebody elses eyes and, um, I've really developed some strong friendships with them because of that.  And like, I say, there's quite an age difference.  Um, I'm thirty four, or thirty two.  And, um, they're in their sixties.  And late -- late sixties, early seventies.  So it's just really interesting getting to talk to them.  And, um, kind of learning about how things are and -- and, uh, they become very attached to my family and my -- my children have adopted them as surrogate grandparents because their own grandparents live so far away in, um, a different state so I'm just very pleased that, you know, that I have the opportunity to get to know, um, them.  And, uh, anyway I wished I had somebody to talk too.  I feel very unusual talking to myself but I want to finish the conversation.  I know I have ten minutes to talk so ...  Um, anyway, I -- I don't know really what else to say.  I know that, um, I've tried just to stay close to some of my really good [MN] close friends in high school and we've just drifted apart.  I know that, um, I had a pretty tragic event that happened when I was in high school that, um, drew me really close to my circle of friends, and that was, um, one of our really good friends, um, got killed in a vehicle accident and she was sixteen.  And, I guess, it really made me appreciate, um, the value of friendship and it brought me closer to, um, my friends and, uh, you know, kind of, you know, made me realize that friendship is very important.  Um, you know.  And ...  Basically I -- I don't know.  I -- to my -- if -- if I were to go out -- I have a very hard time meeting people.  You know, in my job I pretty much work at a desk and I don't have to interact with the people except for on the telephone.  Um, and so I don't develop very many close relationships through my job.  I have casual relationships that, you know, I have and I just, uh, you know, being a -- a -- a single parent and I have two children, it's very difficult to, you know, go out and have a social [LAUGH] life and to meet people and ...  I just, you know, I -- I wish that I had the opportunity to get with other single parents or single mothers and -- and form a -- a group of people to interact and to share a common interest, um, with our kids.  Um, my sister, she's actually she's, um, involved in that
