R:  Hi.  I'm Tiffany.
L:  Hi.  My name is Diane.  What did you say yours was?
R:  Tiffany.
L:  Chrisny[?]?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's an unusual name. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Chrisny.
R:  No.  Sorry.  Tiffany with a T.  Tiffany.
L:  Oh, Tiffany?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Like, Breakfast at Tiffany's?
R:  Ah, yeah.  Exactly.  I like what you thought it was though. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Okay.
R:  That was interesting.  What was our topic?  I was, like, "What?"
L:  [LAUGH] N- -- it's about corporate scandals and how we feel about it and if we feel the government can do anything about it.  And, um --
R:  Interesting.  What do you think?
L:  Ah, I -- apparently, I -- they can't do much about it because they haven't done anything about it.  I mean, we've got Enron and WorldCom and Tyco and all kinds of big corporations that are, you know -- gone bottoms up and completely ruined all of their shareholders lives by losing all their money.  And -- and they've done nothing to 'em.  And now, I suppose the reason we're talking about this subject today is because of poor Martha Stewart. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  Y- --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  They, kinda, zeroed in on her and she's under indictment and -- I don't know.  I don't know.  How do you feel about Martha getting arrested?
R:  Um, [SIGH] it's interesting.  I- it's one of those things where I feel like -- ew.  It's -- the evidence seems to suggest that she did have some knowledge --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- some insider knowledge.  I mean, it -- it's, sort of, reasonable to believe that she did have some insider knowledge but I'm -- I'm curious to see how they're going to prove that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  It -- it's hard to prove what somebody knows and the information they get unless you have some, sort of, hard evidence.  So --
L:  Well, that's true.  I never thought about that but you're absolutely right.  It would be difficult to prove.  They cl- -- v- -- what are they claiming?  They found some note or something?
R:  Ah, you know what?  I haven't even heard.  Um, I -- I don't know h- --
L:  I thought I, like --
R:  I don't know --
L:  I --
R:  -- how they think she got the information.  I -- I think she knows people that have the -- the inside information but I'm not sure --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- how they think she got it.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you know, if it happened over a phone call that would be very hard to prove.
L:  That's true.  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And -- and I'm sure that somebody, if they were giving her inside information, wouldn't be so, um, you know, unintelligent as to send it via email [LAUGH] or -- or in a note or something.
L:  Well, we would hope not. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  But i- it --
R:  So, it'll be interesting to see if they can prove it.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Certainly, I think it's wrong.  It's unfair.  You know?  I- it --
L:  Ah, well, I think they're, kinda, picking on her 'cause she's a public figure and -- and then she's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a woman and she's made it in a man's world.  And although --
R:  And it --
L:  -- I'm not Martha's biggest fan by any means, I mean, she has made a success in a -- in the corporate world.  And --
R:  Right.
L:  And I think, you know, the big boys don't like that.
R:  Yeah.  You're right.  And it's interesting that she's getting more heat than --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the Enron executives.  L- like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's very bizarre.  W- -- ye- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's getting the backlash from all of that, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all of that that happened before and ...  So, that's an interesting thing because those guys are, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- their hands were caught and -- you know, they were totally caught.  So --
L:  Yeah.  And -- and just out and out r- -- crooked.  And -- and apparently, none of 'em are even in prison or in -- a slap on the hand or anything.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, that's really -- and what they did really affected --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, employees and their -- the -- poor p- people that have been working for years and ended up with nothing and -- and that's really sad.  It's sad when people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- lost their jobs and ended up --
L:  Right.  With nothing.
R:  -- you know, broke when these guys walked away with millions or dollars and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a -- a good scolding.
L:  Right.  And -- and --
R:  I mean, I d- -- yeah.  I do think the government should do something.
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  You know?
L:  I, you know -- well, we all know that George W. Bush was, kinda, in bed with Kenny Lay, you know, the Enron exec. because that was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, Kenny boy. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  And w- -- and -- and so, nothing happened to him but y- you're -- I agree with ya.  I think the government should be doing something about it.  I mean, they came out and said they were going to do something about it.  I mean, then we don't hear anything more about it.  It's just, like, kinda forgotten.  But poor old Martha, she's gonna go [PAUSE] -- you know, she's --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  She [LAUGH] --
R:  Who knows what's gonna happen to Martha.
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  So, interesting.  I'm not sure if they can do anything to prevent it from happening.  I think, sort of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- the -- the -- the greed that's, sort of, inherent in these guys that -- that find their -- their way to the top of corporations and --
L:  I --
R:  -- you know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- they want more and more.
L:  It's -- it's -- it's --
R:  I think the c- --
L:  It's such a --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- sad situation.  I mean, here are these people in these [MN] positions of power and they have the ability to really do good things and instead, they do these horrible things and -- and, like you say, the greed just -- just totally takes over, it seems like.
R:  Right.  It's bizarre.  So, I'm not sure there's any way to, sort of, um, [LIPSMACK] -- the government can do anything to, sort of, stop the greed --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- because that's a --
L:  It --
R:  -- a human nature --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thing i- in --
L:  Yeah.  You're right.
R:  -- terms of some people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But after the fact, I mean, they can certainly make the penalties really stiff to the point that, you know, there's a -- there's a deterrent effect.
L:  R- -- exactly.  Ah, is -- 'cause these guys, apparently, just y- -- oh, I remember I watched -- after the Enron thing I watched, um, Mrs. Lay, Kenny's w- wife, and she was on some talk show pleading about well, they still only had -- they on- -- they only had three of their mansions left and --
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] my god.
L:  And I'm, like, sitting here in my little apartment, you know, and thinking --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Exactly.
L:  They had -- well, isn't that sad, you know?
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  And I was --
R:  And I --
L:  -- personally affected by WorldCom because I w- work for the state and we -- our state retirement fund was heavily invested in WorldCom.
R:  [MN] Oh, interesting.
L:  So, I lost a lot of money in that. [LAUGH] And --
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, and it's, like -- we probably won't ever see that again.
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  So --
R:  Wow.  That's too bad.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- I really did think -- when this whole thing happened I thought they needed to take everything these people own.
L:  I -- exactly.
R:  And exa- -- take it and distribute it among the -- the poor people who lost everything.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  You don't need --
L:  Beca- --
R:  -- three mansions.  You c- -- like you said, you -- you manage to live in an apartment.  We manage to live in an apartment.
L:  Uh-huh.  Exactly.
R:  Those Enron executives don't have an inherent right to live in three mansions.
L:  No.  No.
R:  M- -- you know?
L:  And -- and to have millions of dollars at their disposal.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, they had --
R:  And millions of dollars that they, basically, stole.
L:  Right.  They --
R:  You know?  S- --
L:  They -- they had the ability to do something good with what they had and instead they just -- like you said, the greed just took over and they totally screwed it up.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- isn't amazing.  I mean, you'd think i- i- if you are just a decent person and you manage to make it and you -- and you have a lot of money and you're very successful, you don't -- I mean, how much does a person need?  Isn't one mansion enough?  Y- you know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  What h- -- what --
L:  Now --
R:  Why would you be tempted to, you know, have two, three, four and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- do illegal things and put everybody else's, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- welfare in the balance?  It's so -- it's bizarre.
L:  Yeah.  And now, a- an example of somebody who has done -- at least from what I've seen -- a lot of good with his money is Bill Gates.
R:  Right.
L:  He has --
R:  Yeah.
L:  He has set up -- and I didn't realize this, I -- I mean, I thought he was just your average, run of the mill billionaire, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Ah, but I saw this program on public television of how he's set up all these different foundations all over t- -- the world, to help, um -- to help stamp out, um, w- -- diseases in other countries that w- -- could be stamped out i- in just a matter of months if we just did it.  You know, if we --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just supplied these countries with the a- -- vaccines and the -- and, ah -- I mean, like, for example, the simple one is diarrhea.  The- there are third world countries that lose people -- millions of people because of [LAUGH] diarrhea.  Something simple like that that could be stamped out.  It's because they don't have decent water.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, their water's contaminated.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's something that could be fixed very cheaply.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  And you would think that more people that had that kind of money would -- would want to do that.
L:  Exactly.  A- and I know a lot of 'em do but, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  But you -- you -- and, ah, we probably don't hear about them but -- but --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- I did happen to see that show with Bill Gates and I thought, well -- I thought, "Gee, he really is a good person". [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and he -- and he's -- he's self made, you know?  He built that --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- company from -- from nothing and made it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- into what it is and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  I'm -- I'm sure he's had to do some very difficult business deals along the way but --
L:  O- oh, yeah.
R:  You know, it's -- it's never been proven that he did anything illegal or bad or -- you know?  There is a good way of making it in the world and giving back.
L:  That's right.  Yeah.  And I --
R:  You know?  And --
L:  And I --
R:  And these guys at Enron, they're -- they're criminals.  I mean, really, you get to that point, what's the difference between that and breaking into people's houses and stealing what they own?
L:  Right.  And --
R:  It's -- it's worse.
L:  And these -- well, I think it's even worse, like you say, because these people trusted him, they worked for him, they put their life savings in his company.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  And -- and now they have nothing.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- these are people that, ah, [SIGH] are in their sixties and seventies and they --
R:  I know.  That's --
L:  -- have no retirement.
R:  That's what's --
L:  What are they gonna do?
R:  -- heartbreaking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's just heartbreaking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because th- they can't what -- yeah.  He can sit back in his two or his three, whatever, how many ever mansions he has left --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and these people can't even pay, you know, the rent.
L:  Right.  The he --
R:  Oh. [SIGH] I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's where I just get crazy and think, "Yes, the government should --"  I mean, we should really be harder on these guys.
L:  Yep.  I -- I --
R:  I -- I don't --
L:  I think so too.
R:  I don't have very much compassion for them at that point.  Y- --
L:  No.
R:  I mean --
L:  I don't either.
R:  Clearly, they're capable of working.  They should go out and get a job like everybody else and -- you know?  I- --
L:  Mhm.  Start paying back.
R:  Whatever wealth they have -- yeah.  Whatever wealth they have should be redistributed to the people that they stole it from.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  I agree.  So --
R:  So -- interesting.
L:  What, um -- what, ah, state do you live in?
R:  I live in California and it's interesting -- I live in Burbank.  How about you?
L:  Oh, d- --
