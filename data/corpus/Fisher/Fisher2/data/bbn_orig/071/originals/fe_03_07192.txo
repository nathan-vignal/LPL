R:  Dorothy, my name is Petra.  How are you doing this fine evening?
L:  Oh, I'm doing fine.  Where are you located?
R:  Oh, that's good.  Brooklyn, New York.  And you?
L:  Oh, my.  New York.  My favorite city is there anyway.
R:  Oh, that's good.  
L:  Oh, I love it.  Yeah.  I'm in, um, Starkville, Mississippi.  
R:  God bless you, child.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I need it, huh?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Y- yes, honey.  That's a long way off my home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  It is.  It is.  Yeah.
R:  How are you doing?  How's the weather there?
L:  Uh, it's nice.  It's just beginning to get, um, you know, hot.  
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  It's been really nice up until, um, this month started and -- and then -- usually we have, uh, you know, some -- some pretty hot days before this time of year so we've been kind of blessed with a nice spring but [LIPSMACK] it's beginning to get warm.
R:  W- we haven't had good weather at all.
L:  You haven't?
R:  No.  
L:  Lots of rain and ...?
R:  It's cold.  It's been -- it's been still winter it feels like at some point.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  But I prefer the cold because it's -- it's more comfortable to me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So I have, y- you know, I don't have to sweat too much with it.  
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Anyway, our topic is friends.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have a lot of friends?
L:  Well, you know, I was just thinking as I was waiting for her to, um, connect --
R:  To get through.  
L:  -- that, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, when I was, uh, young in school and growing up, you know, I -- I always had tons of friends.  Always.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But, um, lately, and I'm sixty six.
R:  Bless your heart.
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm gonna be fifty five next month.
L:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
R:  But I've been told I look like I'm twenty two and I say --
L:  You're kidding?
R:  -- would you people stop.  
L:  Oh.
R:  You all need glasses, children.
L:  No.  Let 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Let em [MN] --
R:  I keep [MN] -- I -- I have to look good before I leave the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the reason is.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But anyway I have a few close friends.  Not a lot of them.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In school -- when we were kids in school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, we had bunches of friends.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You were supposed to do that, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, at present I have just a very small close few that's there.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  Don't believe in crowds.  Can't take all these mouths they got out there.  And these young people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- today they don't even talk to each other.  They scream at each other.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  And I'm saying --
L:  You're right.
R:  -- to myself, but you're looking at each other's face.  What's the screaming for?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I mean, we need to scream because we on the other side of the planet to each other.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.  But I do have -- I do have one very special friend that I've had since, uh, fifth grade.  And she's about a hundred and seventy miles from me.
R:  Oh, I thought you was gonna give me her age.  I was about to fall down.
L:  Oh, no.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-uh, no.  She's my very same age.  We were in -- were in the same grade in school, in fifth --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- grade.  
R:  I have one girlfriend that I have known all my life since high school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  High school?  No, junior high school.  So that's forty -- forty five years at some point.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Forty five, fifty years.  I don't know.  One --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of the two of them.  And we're very, very close.  Very, very close.
L:  Have you ever, sort of, um, um, lost track or not kept as well.
R:  Yeah, we lost track for exactly eighteen years one time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that is amazing.  The fire engines are working.  Everytime I get on a good call the f- the -- the fire engines are coming.
L:  Uh-oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Can you still hear me?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  My girlfriend and I we lost track eighteen years of our life.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I did not know that she had gone to school, um, for a nurses aid.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there I was out of the Mayor's office.  The Mayor couldn't make the, uh, ceremonial ritual ceremony event and I was there to talk in the Mayor's place.  At that time --
L:  Oh.  
R:  -- it was Mayor Koch.  Now I didn't know she was there.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But I do know one thing that excited me to no end.  She was the furthest thing on my mind until they mentioned her name.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I came up off that table and I said, "Wait a minute.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it."
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I went to the podium, interrupting the whole affair, and I said, "What name did you just say?"
L:  Oh.
R:  And they said Sandra Fawcett.  And I said, "You've got to be kidding".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I said, "Will the Miss Sandra Fawcett please stand up?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "And y'all have to excuse us because we have not seen each other in eighteen years".
L:  I'll be darned.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, honey, we ran into each other's arms just like we were school kids, crying like babies.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  That was the biggest experience in my life with a very dear friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we promised thereon in we would never lose ea- each other again.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so you've kept up, huh?
R:  Yes.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're still there together.
L:  Well, this friend of mine, um, we -- we -- we always knew where the other one was but sometimes I was in California raising my family and she was in Memphis, and so we didn't, uh, she came out there once to visit me but -- but --
R:  Oh, that was [inaudible].
L:  -- it's not like, uh, she -- [MN] at that time, you know, at different times in our -- over the years she has not been the closest person to me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But we've always known, you know, and kept in touch --
R:  You can reach each other.
L:  -- at Christmas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, things like that.  But now that we are both, uh, we both have problem sons.
R:  Yeah, same thing here.
L:  Yeah.  And we're --
R:  Health problems with each other.
L:  -- both divorced.  
R:  Oh, for God's sake. 
L:  And so we just have -- 
R:  Look at that.
L:  -- um, and of course we're both the same age and now we're -- we're like, um, geographically closer together so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so we really, um, we share a lot of this growing old stuff together. 
R:  Same thing here -- 
L:  You know.
R:  -- with my girlfriend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My girlfriend's two years older than me but we were in high school and we hung on to each other throughout the years.
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  What we wanted to do, couldn't be done because our parents didn't allow us to do it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Both of us wanted to go into the military area.
L:  Oh, yes.  [MN]
R:  And we wanted that for one specific reason.  So that mummy and daddy wouldn't have to worry about our education 'cause it was free education once you got involved.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that had always been my thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but my father blew up on my graduation dinner and --
L:  Why -- it was a stigma.
R:  -- he slapped me all over this place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Embarrassed me on graduation dinner night.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I was just outdone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now what her mother did was, "You gonna leave me?  That means I have nobody to take care of" and the mother got deliberately ill.
L:  Oh.
R:  Enough to be taken --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to emergency room.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And both of us can still talk about those times [MN] as --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- if it was last night that it happened to us.
L:  Well, you know bef- before, let's see, I guess as I was growing up as a -- a young child, my sister was twelve years older.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So when she was eighteen she wanted to join the military too.  But she didn't have to have anybody stop her because in those days it was just really frowned on.  You know, if you were --
R:  Yeah.  It was frowned upon.
L:  If you were a --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- female in the military then you --
R:  Forget about it.
L:  -- had loose morals.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  And -- yeah.
R:  Well -- well, I wouldn't dare mention the language my father used on me --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- at that dinner table.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  You are gonna be nothing but a boom, boom, boom.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  And I just looked.  I didn't know what the man was talking about.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I had no idea what this person was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- talking about.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I couldn't imagine how dirty his mind was but I knew --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he was no good anyhow.  But ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Beside the point, to drop me into that level and call me everything under the sun, I couldn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- imagine.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And her mother did labelling on her too.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So both of us --
L:  Man.
R:  -- could sit back now --
L:  But, you know, now you know what?  If -- if -- if they had not stood in my sister's way.  If the -- if the stigma hadn't been there for my sister, and for you as well, you might -- you might be very well educated, retired from the military.
R:  Let me -- let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  We were discussing that on one of our phone calls in the past and -- and the first thing [MN] both of us remember was when she introduced me to her father --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- her father looked at me head to toe and practically saluted me by calling me the general.  "You will always be my girl -- my daughter's general".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I said, "General?"  I don't think I'd get that high in life.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It never would have o- occurred to me, had my father not used that stigma nonsense on me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, uh, the way my girlfriend sees it, she figures that you -- you'd probably be a four star general.  This -- let's not go so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- high up, you know.  I didn't get there [LAUGH] yet.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  She said, in life itself being that you can handle everything that's thrown at you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You [MN] are still my general.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Which is so sweet.
L:  I'll be darned.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, see some -- sometimes, I don't know.  At this stage in my life sometimes I wish I, sometimes, I wish I could go back and do it all over again and not be influenced by some of the people.
R:  Everybody else.  Yeah.
L:  And some of the things.
R:  The family.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the -- and the nonsense in the news, you know. 
L:  Yeah.  Right.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Society.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Sorta, um, you know.
R:  Exactly.  Societal[?] bullshit is what I call it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Do you have a computer?
R:  No, I don't.  I wish I did.
L:  Oh, shoot.  I was gonna say give me your email address and I'd email ya.  I love to hear from people, you know, that are living in a different area than me.  But ...
R:  Let me have your address, uh, your full name.

R:  That's easy.  Dorothy --
L:  Yeah.
