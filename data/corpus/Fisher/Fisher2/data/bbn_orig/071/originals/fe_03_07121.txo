L:  Hi, I'm Teri.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  [LAUGH]  Hi.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, so corporate misconduct.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is this your first time doing this?
R:  Second time
L:  Second for me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Uh, well, hey, we could talk about Martha Stewart?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's corporate misconduct.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  What do you think about it?
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- you know, what?  I have been so personally busy, uh, I got hit with so many different things just recently, I haven't had that much opportunity to keep up with it.  I thought -- I'm, oh, gosh.  
L:  I just, uh, all I've read -- well, basically, I just read on that she's been indicted.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So that they're talking about giving her jail time.  And there's kind of like the pros and cons about whether or not, um, she should be given a lot of jail time or just a slap on the wrist.  Some people are saying, yeah, give her some good -- you know, this white collar crime.  Give -- give her really good jail time.  Um, I don't really know what I think 'cause I don't -- I don't know if she -- if she really did something or if she's just like kind of somebody who's getting hit with it.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  Because somebody else did it.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um ...
R:  It certainly does not go with her persona, I'll tell you that.
L:  Oh, right.  Right.  That's [MN] --
R:  It's not a good thing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, no.  [LAUGH]  Um, you know, I -- it -- one of the questions I think they just asked was, um, if we think it affected the economy, all of these.  And I think definitely yeah.  Especially with the Enron scandal and all of that.  I think that's probably why savings rates are s- stink right now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and wh- what they can do, I don't know.  [LAUGH]  I -- do you have any ideas?
R:  No.  No.  I -- I -- because the reason I don't is because I -- I really and truly think nothing can be done in this system of government, or any [MN].
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I really -- I -- I feel like it started back when these people were babies.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Parents don't seem to be doing the right jobs.
L:  Mm.
R:  And they're too busy out working to get stuff, things in- instead of concentrating on the -- the true -- the real issue at hand, which is raising a human being.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and forming their thinking abilities and stuff like that.  And -- and setting inside of -- of their children what is right and wrong and what is important in life.
L:  But --
R:  And it's always, you know what --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the all mighty dollar.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, I -- I -- I think, you know, you're definitely right in that because now it's like [MN] so much of this world is a -- is a two parent, um, workforce.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're parents aren't home.  All it is, is like, okay, we both need to work so we can have the two cars.  Every -- n- new two cars every three years, two years, um, you know, and have everything you want and then [MN] I think you're right.  The kids get left out.  Then they grow up just thinking that it's just money that's important.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ...
R:  Um, we have, um, uh, a Chinese restaurant nearby.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the whole family worked in the restaurant.  It was really fun to go there 'cause, you know, you could see the kids coming in after school, shoving their books in a corner and, you know, getting to work and making tips and stuff like that.  And, um, all of a sudden one day I saw this beautiful picture of a -- a Chinese young man in the paper and he was murdered.
L:  [MN]
R:  And, I'm there, I know him.  I know him.  And it was the young man from the restaurant.  He was found in a trashcan --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with the lid on in the bottom of a -- a mine hole.
L:  Oh.
R:  And his Mercedes was parked nearby.
L:  [MN]
R:  And he was, um, he was found to be trafficking in drugs and weapons.
L:  And this -- and this was one of the -- the -- the guys that was involved in the Chinese restaurant?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.
R:  And the parents said that they, well it was said of the parents that they were very hard working parents.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and tried to provide their children with everything and I -- I couldn't help but think if they would only have been home with them maybe they would've noticed that his -- his son was doing something like that.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh, but they gave him a Mercedes.
L:  Mm.  Right.  Right.  And -- and this was just, what?  Like just a teenager or ...?
R:  Uh, yeah, like eighteen or so.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Okay, so ...  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, well, you know, th- this is [MN] -- you hear that all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  That's, like you said, if -- if -- if mom and dad are just thinking about that all might dollar that's what the kids are, and they're probably giving the kids everything in -- in, um, material things as --
R:  Correct.
L:  -- opposed to time.
R:  Like I taught my children -- I really taught them, like, this is what is happening with the cabbage patch doll.  This is what is happening with designer, uh, shoes.  Um, [MN] grown ups are going into the stores fighting over them, hitting each other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  U- uh, if you would decide that these are things that are important to you, what you're doing is making the toy store rich. 
L:  Right. 
R:  And --
L:  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  I [MN] I te- tell you, I saw that quite often because I used to -- years ago when my daughter was little I used to work part time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a -- in a department store.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [LAUGH] I -- in the customer depar- -- uh, service department and I would see little grey haired old ladies [MN] curse a blue streak at me because I didn't have Elmo [LAUGH] at the time.
R:  My gosh.
L:  Yeah.  I -- it was -- it was horrible.  You know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean.  [LAUGH]  Uh, so I know exactly what you're talking about.  [LAUGH]  You know.  But that -- yeah -- you're -- you're right, it's, um, it's a problem with how people [MN] or have been raising their kids. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  To think only about, um, succeeding in -- in, I guess, the corporate world or just money, money, money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Like the ro- -- the guy with the most toy -- toys -- the guy who dies with the most toys wins.  
L:  Wins.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  
L:  That's true.
R:  Good grief.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  That -- yeah, definitely.  So, I mean, I don't know with, um, getting back to Martha Stewart, she -- she had an empire there.
R:  I'll say.
L:  And if -- and if she really did do this, you know, I mean, did get information that she shouldn't have then -- then that -- I mean, then sh- she definitely should, you know, be prosecuted.  Because, come on, how much money does she need?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  This is -- this is the whole thing.  I mean, it's you know, she's a multibillionaire and she gets information that she shouldn't.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...  Um, but that remains to be seen what happens there.  I don't really know so much about that thing with the, um, Enron.  That happened --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- a while ago.  I just know that there was some kind of scandal and basically that they said that they misrepresented what they actually had in, I don't know, in stock or something like that.  I'm not really sure.  'Cause I'm -- I don't really follow that kind of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ...
R:  Me either.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I'm not -- you know, t- talk to me of stocks and bonds, I'm like, okay, I really don't know.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But --
R:  But you know what?  You know what's really important?  That we do know how to raise good children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I mean?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  Because even they -- [MN] one -- part of the question is, do we think the government can help?  The people in government were raised by parents just like everybody else.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Were these parents -- what would -- what values were these parents instilling in -- in the government peo- -- uh, officials when they were --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- children?
L:  Right.  
R:  I -- I just don't have that much, uh, faith in ... [LAUGH] 
L:  But, yeah, I don't think it's -- it's up to, um -- up to the government to do that.  You know, it's just like people talking about how teachers should teach kids manners or this and that.  
R:  Right.
L:  That's not where it's supposed to come from.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's supposed to come from the home.  And that's -- that's the whole basis of how a person is created.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, um, I think we've lost that somewhere along the line.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, in [MN] -- I don't know if it's just our country or -- or what but, um, definitely it -- it's become a real mercenary, you know, money, money type of thing rather than building character.
R:  Did you ever hear of time dollars?
L:  Time dollars?
R:  Mhm.
L:  No.  
R:  Um, it's on the internet.  It's -- it's, uh, one word.  And, uh, we have [MN], uh, something in -- I'm in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Where are you?
L:  Oh, I'm in Long Island, New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  We're not too far.
R:  No.  My son lives in New York.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Um, an actor.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, how wonderful.
R:  Yeah.  Um, uh, oh, it -- it's based on -- it's almost like barter.  But it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's -- you take an hour of your time and it equals an hour of my time.  No matter what it is we do. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it is helping to instill the real values of life in -- into -- it's a legacy we're gonna be leaving our children.  
L:  Really?
R:  I joined it -- yes.  I think it --
L:  And it's called time dollars?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it was, um, uh, Edgar Cohn, C- -- uh, C.O.H.N.  Uh, I -- he was a
