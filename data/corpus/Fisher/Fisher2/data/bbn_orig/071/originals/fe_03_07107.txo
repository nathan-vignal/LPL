R:  Yeah, hello.  This is Rochelle.
L:  Hi, Rochelle.  This is Suzie.  I'm in Illinois.
R:  Hello, Suzie.  I'm in Tennessee.
L:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  I totally could not hear what the topic was.
R:  Okay, it says corporate -- corporate conduct in the U.- U.S. how has, um, how -- what can the U.S. government do to curb, um, corporate scandals and stuff, like the Martha Stewart thing that's going on now?
L:  Oh, geez.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Like that -- that -- like that.  Exac- --
L:  She's like one of those you just love -- oh, well, I just to love to hate [LAUGH] anyway.
R:  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
L:  She's like one of those too good for reality people.
R:  Yeah.  And that's what it -- it's like she deserved it.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause she --
L:  Y- yeah, it -- that's -- that's so true 'cause it's almost like you kind of cheer.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  'Cause it's like, oh, but we thought she was so perfect.
L:  Yeah.  Or at least she did.
R:  Yeah, so it's like, eh, good.  It's [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, you know, I totally believe that she did do that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  The insider trading.  You know she did.
L:  Oh, yeah.  She was --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- right on that.
R:  I mean, what did they say?  She sold the stock, like what, a couple a hours or a couple a days before ...?
L:  Like -- like the day or something before.  So --
R:  And you think that was a insider trading?  Yes, it was.
L:  Yeah, some coincidences are just too coincidental to really be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] coincidence.
R:  She knows she did it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm glad because now all that stuff that's too high in Walmart and K Mart anyway is all on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sale.  
L:  Oh, no that -- well, and it's so funny because, you know, she had this image of being the perfect everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But everything, you know, I mean, she's an attorney.  She knows better.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's got a law degree and she's -- I mean, I think everybody can pretty much tell she's a perfect, if you like, 'scuse my french, bitch.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I -- I'm sorry about the cuss word but ...
R:  Right.  
L:  I just, you know, she just does not look like a nice person.
R:  Yeah.  So you know she did it.  They can get over it.  I mean, a lot of corporate scandals they don't even get -- they don't even get that much display but because Martha Stewart, somebody else obviously --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hated her enough to tear her down.
L:  Well, and you think too, I mean, if Martha Stewart did it, how many -- well, that guy that called her called all of the family members too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, well, with that Enron thing.  
R:  Yeah.  See Enron was the same thing.  A big ol' corporate and the Watergate.  All that was a big ol' corporate scandal.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  And, I mean, my, um, job -- I just quit my job because of, um, ethics.  Mine.  [LAUGH]  I worked for a big pharmaceutical company.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the thing is with all these big corporations, you know, quite frankly, I mean, I was a rep.  I'd go into the doctors' offices.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I would go in there and tell 'em about the drugs and I -- my parents raised me to be honest.
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know, I'm like, you know, if this isn't the right drug don't use it.  [MN]  You know, for these patients it's not right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the companies, all they care about is money.  They --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't care if they hurt somebody.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, you know, I'm -- I'm kind of an idealist and I -- I'm thirty one years old.  I'm too old to be an idealist but still am.  And it's like, you know, when my boss yells at me for going in there and being honest there's a problem.  'Cause --
R:  Well, that's how it is.  I mean, like anybody can -- everybody can sit there and tell me that there's no cure for +AIDS and I don't believe it because, number one --
L:  I don't either.
R:  -- there's a lot of money in that.  
L:  I -- I think that there are a lot of things that there are probably cures for.
R:  There are.  And [MN] --
L:  Starting back with something like sickle cell anemia.
R:  There's money for it.  There -- it's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- already there.  It's already there.  The cure is --
L:  And --
R:  -- already there.  It's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- sitting up in some pharmaceutical office.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Some -- locked in some safe, and why aren't they gonna put it out?  Because it's too much money.  It's worth too much money to research for it.
L:  Well, either -- either the research is worth too much money or they know -- 'cause like with all the, um, I -- I worked for the company that has a lot of the, like, A.Z.T. and stuff for AIDS.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, they were getting so much flak for how much they were charging for A.Z.T. and some of the other retrovirals.  Um, they -- they finally started giving it away in African countries and third world countries where the rate of AIDS is extremely high.
R:  Right.
L:  But the thing is, except for the bad publi- publicity --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they couldn't cared less.
R:  But they still get -- and they still get money for that though.
L:  Yeah.  They, you know --
R:  They still get, uh, millions of dollars from the government and from those governments for that.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's still money in it.
L:  Yeah.  And, I think, you know like this topic thing they talk -- they want to talk -- hear about things like, um, Enron but there's, I think, corruption in corporations goes way so much deeper.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because everybody is out for the almighty dollar.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they want to keep up with the Joneses.  And some Joneses might make twenty grand a year, but some other Joneses might make twenty million a year.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, you know, they don't live next to the twenty million dollar Joneses but they are all so busy defining themselves by what they make and what they have that the corruption is kind of an after effect of greed, I think.  
R:  It's a definite effect of greed.  
L:  Yeah, I think if people would -- and, I don't know.  Um, you know, I think -- in the olden days you always heard about how churches took care of people.  The government didn't take care of people, it was all churches and families.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, I don't know if there were less homeless people and less people, you know, hurting in, you know, from drugs, from alcohol and whatever, but it seems to me that I don't, you know, I -- I -- for some reason I think that if the churches took it back over and the social service agencies took it back over we'd be in a lot better shape.
R:  A lot better shape.  I mean, as rich as the United States is, there's no reason why the United States at all should ever have any homeless people.  I just don't understand that at all.
L:  Mhm.  And there are people -- I mean, there are little kids starving and, you know, I -- I'm glad that they're [MN] putting in some, like, retraining things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For some of the parents who, you know, maybe grew up without learning, you know, a skill that they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- can market for a job.  
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And the working poor thing.  I mean, that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a reality.  When --
R:  Well --
L:  -- somebody's, you know, working their butt off, you know, two jobs and they can't make ends meet.
R:  Well, see, what -- what bothers me about that is, number one, like if we're talking about the corporations.  You know these corporations can get anyone from anywhere and train 'em.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they don't want to.
L:  No.  They want cheap labor and that's why they're all --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- going off to Mexico.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And Asia.  South East --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- Asia.
R:  Exactly.  When you can just pay the people here to do the same job and probably better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They will do a better -- a better job of doing what they had to do but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're not gonna.
L:  Yeah, and it's like management, like, I mean, like, American cars all went to pot for a long time and if management would just, you know, make sure that they have quality designs and quality controls, meaning other people double checking and rechecking, we wouldn't have those problems of the, you know, the illusion, like, you know, Ford cars are crap so they're gonna buy a Honda.  
R:  Right.  Exactly.  
L:  And, you know, a lot of the Asian and European car companies are now moving [MN] you know different manufacturing plants here but it doesn't matter 'cause it all goes, again, back -- I was shocked to hear, like, in World War Two, Japanese companies enslaved U.S., um, soldiers and their own people if they were dissidents, or whatever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in companies like Mitsubishi.
R:  Really?
L:  Sanyo.  Yes.  I was -- I mean, and I went back and checked the history and they enslaved people to work for companies like that.  And --
R:  No way.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, go back and check the World War Two history stuff or if you have a -- you have a computer obviously.
R:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  Do a search on, um, World War Two Japanese, um, and, um, slavery.
R:  Wow.
L:  Like google it or something.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it -- I mean, you know, that kind of stuff comes from greed too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, I don't know, I think it boils down to basic greed in people.
R:  And then you know what's even wild?  You know, all these companies when they relocate over here?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  These companies don't pay taxes.
L:  That's right because they get all those breaks.  I forgot about that.
R:  They have seven years where they don't pay anything.
L:  And that's ridiculous.
R:  They don't pay any taxes whatsoever, so if you're a Mexican person and you want to move to U.S. and open a business you can do it because, number one, you don't have to worry about any business taxes whatsoever for seven years.  
L:  That's crazy.  And [MN] --
R:  The big plant, Saturn[?], you see, I'm -- where I stay in Nashville, Tennessee --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they, uh, they have a Saturn plant.  They have a +Nissan[?] plant.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And they're getting ready to move another plant here.  I can't remember what it is.
L:  Nashville's a pretty city.
R:  But, uh -- yeah.  But, they -- they're, um -- all these companies, they don't pay any taxes.
L:  They get everything for free.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wouldn't it be [inaudible] if you and I who work and live here could get everything for free like that?
R:  And pay our taxes.  We pay -- we paid our taxes since we started work but we can't open a business and have -- and be tax -- and have a tax break?
L:  Yeah, and they talk about small business and, you know, it's the greed of the corporations and the greed of the country with the taxes.  Like you're saying, you know, they want the business over here but they're gonna keep the small American person out of business.
R:  Out of business.  
L:  Because they'll give the tax breaks to someone foreign.
R:  Exactly.  What is that about?
L:  Yeah, well that --
R:  The U.S. government is all messed up.
L:  Yeah.  It's kind of funny how everything boils down to the basic human fault of greed.  
R:  Mhm.  Really.  But you --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- gonna do us like that and then let everybody else come over.  Well ...
L:  Yeah, it's like you get -- you re- -- have you read about, like, the people who would randomly go and, like, they'd walk by somebody's car and th- -- notice their meter ran out so they had a quarter in their pocket and put it in and got arrested?
R:  No way.
L:  Yeah.  That was in the news, like, two years ago and I was just shocked.  It's like, you know, you can't do a good deed or those random acts of kindness, or whatever, because it's illegal to go put a quarter in somebody's elses parking meter when it's expired.  And, like, that's ridiculous.
R:  That is.  I --
L:  That's not what --
R:  -- can't believe somebody would even waste the time [MN] arresting someone for that.
L:  That -- that's why it got in the news like it did.  Is because it's so ridiculous.  And --
R:  You don't do things like that, man.  We're supposed to be the country of freedom and all this good things and you can come over here and do anything you want.  
L:  But --
R:  But the Americans are getting done real bad.
L:  It's a country of greedy people.  
R:  That's what it is.
L:  Or the government. 
R:  That's what it is.  And, you know, I truly believe that, 'cause, you see, I've lived in Germany.  I've lived
