R:  Good.
L:  Uh, this is the first time I've ever done one of these so ...
R:  Oh, this is only my second so don't fe- -- don't worry.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So --
L:  So what do w- -- [MN] what do we need to do?  Talk about outdoor activities?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Ok- -- well, I like outdoor activities.  
R:  Mm.  'Scuse -- what did you say?
L:  I like the outdoor activities.  They said[?], do you like outdoor or indoor?
R:  Uh, pretty much outdoor, yeah.  
L:  Me too.
R:  Indoor basketball's pretty fun but, um, outdoor I like to pl- play soccer, outdoor basketball, um, street hockey and, um, biking.
L:  Oh, you're very active.  Now I was when I was a little bit younger.  But I like swimming, softball, uh, baseball, basketball, uh, camping.  My husband, he likes hunting.  So mo- mostly we do like outdoors activities.  
R:  Uh, +badminton's pretty fun too?
L:  Yeah.  And, um, like, uh, volleyball.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's fun.  Anything with the beach I like too.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Indoor activities.  I -- I've always -- if it's a indoor swimming pool, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I can't think of many, you know.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Except for, like you said, basketball.  
R:  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Ice hockey, some -- I suppose, sometimes.  
L:  I like ice skating.  I don't know about hockey.  I don't know -- I've never played ice hockey.  
R:  Yeah, I -- I haven't either.  I can't really ice skate so I stick with street hockey.  
L:  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah, I can ice skate and, uh -- now the other indoor activities.  Roll- -- like at the roller rink.  That's fun.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Uh, horseback riding.  That was o- one of my favorites growing up.  
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've tried that a few times.
L:  Yeah, well I had a pony growing up, uh, as well.  But, um, now it -- it's just indoors, uh, we have a trailer that we, uh, go camping in but that's a trailer so we do that kind of indoors.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I don't know what else.
R:  Um.  Do you like skiing or snow boarding?  Like anything --
L:  Love it.  Love it.  Yes, I do.  Um, we just -- a- as a matter of fact this win- -- I [several inaudible words] snow tubing.  That was a lot of fun.  
R:  Yeah, that's -- I like doing that.  
L:  And skiing.  I like it.  I haven't been up it -- on the slopes in skis in a while though.  But I -- that's -- I love it.  The fresh air and ...
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm gonna try to learn how to snowboard next winter.  [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, that's fun.  It's -- it's a lot of fun but you gotta go to one that's not a lot of people because it's a line.  
R:  [MN]
L:  When we went the weather was pretty warm.  It's better, probably, a little bit colder 'cause it's faster.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Now do you like rides?
R:  As in ...?
L:  Uh, like to go on rides outside.  Like [MN] ferris wheels and stuff like that?  Roller coasters?
R:  Um, yeah.  Pretty much.  Roller coasters are pretty fun.  
L:  I won't go upside down but I like [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I like the ro- roller coasters, like the old wooden one.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They got one of them in Wildwood[?], New Jersey.  We always go on that.  But, uh, the ones that, uh, Great Six Flags.  Forget it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They're -- they're -- have you ever been on 'em?
R:  Um, I -- yeah, I -- I've -- there's a Six Flags in California so I'm not sure -- I remember there was a few of 'em.  One of them, it's like one of ones where you just -- where your legs dangle down and you go upside down.  It's pretty fun.
L:  Yeah.  So you like to go upside down.  That scares me.  I don't know why.  It just scares me.  But water rides and I'll do any.  
R:  Yeah [MN] --
L:  I'll do any water ride.  I just love water.
R:  Yeah, those are really fun.  Especially when it's really hot out.  
L:  Yeah.  And no, um -- and like [MN] down the [inaudible] and all of that.  The waves and stuff like that.  
R:  Do you like to swim outside?  I take it you like to swim outside in the ocean and stuff?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I quite often, one of those, um, uh, what do you call 'em?  Last -- last year and a lifeguard [LAUGH] had to come out.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  U- undertow.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, Lord.  But, um, yeah I guess we're pretty much in favor of outdoor activities.  There's that -- was it anything we else ha- -- um, should talk about?
R:  I'm not sure.  Do you like to watch any activities on TV?
L:  Um, probably soft- -- uh, I'm sorry, baseball.  I'm an Oriels fan so -- but not real big at it.  I'd rather go to the ballparks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, like golf and all.  It's just so boring to me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  It is just so boring to watch.  That and tennis.  But, uh, [MN] softball's okay too, like when it's sort a -- a championship.  I like that.  Superbowl.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  We'll watch that.  
R:  Yeah, it's about the only the time I watch football.
L:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because it's for something, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But baseball, uh, probably a little bit more.  But not really too much.  I used to watch wrestling a lot.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I like wrestling.  I like that.
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I like the Rock.
R:  Yeah, he's pretty cool.  Do you still --
L:  [MN]
R:  Do you still watch it often or not really that much?
L:  Uh, not really.  I wa- -- I used to watch it faithfully every week but not -- [MN] not too much anymore.  My daughter doesn't like it.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I grew -- I grew up liking it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've liked it for quite a few years now.
L:  Ye- yeah.  'Cause it's just fun.  It's more like a soap opera.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, so to speak.  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]  It is.  Then, uh, they just had a story on about that Jake the Snake.  A- as a matter of fact the other night I watched it and he's [several inaudible words] on drugs.  Cocaine.  
R:  Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
L:  I -- [MN] -- yeah, I didn't know that.  But, I -- I was surprised.  And then they had the other guy where the mo- -- the wife was watching.  He was really beat up.  The one that -- he's a heavy guy.  Um, he t- -- he -- he fought against the Rock.  He had the white sock on.  
R:  Oh, um, Mick Foley.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  And his wife was real upset because he [MN] -- his whole head was cut open.  They had stitches.  
R:  Yeah, that -- that was -- that was pretty gruesome.
L:  I know.  So, you know, you can get hurt. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, it's a lot of acting but you can get hurt too.
R:  Yeah.  The injuries are real.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So ...  Uh, so is this your second survey?
R:  Yeah.  I did one yesterday.  
L:  So you call in or do they call you?
R:  Um, I call -- I've called in both -- both times.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Just --
L:  So ...
R:  I got a call the other day but it wasn't a topic that I really knew much about so I didn't take it.  
L:  Well, see with me I was always a outdoor, uh, uh, uh, when I was a kid I was always outdoors playing ball.  And now I have a daughter so I'm always -- she's always outdoors playing ball and that.  So I think I'm more of an outdoor than indoor.
R:  [MN]
L:  Indoors only when it, like, rains and all.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, +God.  I can't really think of nothing indoors besides when I was in school playing, like, basketball and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- soccer.  Indoor soccer we played. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]  Um, like I said, we did, like, horseback riding.  We had, like, a farm.  I suppose around ten.  That was probably the best days, you know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...  Yeah, we're outside.  I think sunny opposed to winter.  I think they were talking about that too.  Uh, s- summer against winter.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I think I like summer.  But I do like the snow, and we got quite a bit here.  
R:  Yeah, we get [MN] quite a bit here too.  
L:  Do ya?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you this year?  We got tons.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't really like the snow.  I -- I'd rather be outside doing basketball or soccer, and stuff like that.  
L:  But you're not a snow person.  Now see I am.  I like the sun, I like the beach and the swimming and ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  More stuff like that.  Camping.  Cook outs.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, can't think of too much else.  
R:  Do you follow auto racing at all?
L:  No.  No.  I never got into that, like, NASCAR and stuff.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  Uh, do you?
R:  Yeah, I love it.  
L:  Do -- do you ever go to a -- to a [MN] a live one?
R:  Uh-huh.  A couple of times, yeah.  Down in, um, Lorden[?], New Hampshire.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And it was fun?
R:  Yeah.  I've raced, uh -- we have a -- auto, um -- kind of a go kart division about ten miles or so from here.  It's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They have, um, a hundred lap races and you get trophies if you win.  [MN]
L:  And you could do it?
R:  Yeah.  I've -- I've [MN] tried it a few times.  Haven't done too bad.  Won once.  
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.  That's really neat.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty fun.  
L:  Now I've reme- -- I go -- I went to a rodeo.  That was fun.  That was different.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I remember going to one when I was a kid.  That was kind of different.  But, um ...  I know a lot of people that's into that NASCAR.  In fact, I
