L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Jim.
L:  [NOISE]  Elizabeth.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  I have no idea what they just said.
R:  Ah, something about corporate, [SIGH] ah, [SIGH] -- ah, s- scandals in the work place, how to prevent it.  But otherwise it was hard to hear.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] corporate s- scandal?  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, has it affect --
L:  Oh, where do we begin?  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, actually they -- they ask, do you think that is -- that it is caused --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- part of, ah, or is any ... way has caused part of the stock market decline and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- depression or recession that we are having now?  [SIGH]
L:  No, I don't think -- [NOISE] I -- I think that's [NOISE] f- false.  I don't believe that has anything to do with [SIGH] [NOISE] -- with recession or the stock market going down or any of that.  [SIGH]
R:  N- no.
L:  I think the stock market's just [NOISE] a game, [SIGH] a very nice monopoly game [NOISE] [SIGH] that you play and you -- if you have extra money you do it.  [SIGH]  You cannot [SIGH] [NOISE] d- depend on the stock market to get yourself wealthy, [SIGH] [NOISE] it's just something that you do as, ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] passing time.  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But as far as the [SIGH] [NOISE] s- scandals --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] jeeze, where does one begin.  [SIGH] [NOISE]  It has always been.  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Those that have money have always [SIGH] [NOISE] been ... [SIGH] [NOISE] able to have that opportunity to do that.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  I feel.  [NOISE]
R:  No matter what goes -- a- a- ah, happens, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's always been manipulation of the stock market.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's -- some get caught --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some don't get caught.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  That's right.
R:  I tend to agree with you in the way that I don't feel that it has had a- a- any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it's not the cause of -- of the recession that's going on now or decline in the stock market.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I feel that, ah, that started --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back in the nineties with the, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] Internet, ah --
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  -- going downhill and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this is just, ah, [SIGH] a, ah, snowball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so to say --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- rolling down the hill and picking up speed.
L:  That's exactly it.  [NOISE]  Yes, that's e- exactly it.  And I guess they're just looking for something to b- blame it on, [SIGH] you know.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  And they really [NOISE] need to look elsewhere for it.  [NOISE]  There's a lot of things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- reasons or recession [SIGH] [NOISE] an awful lot of things.  People aren't feeling comfortable right now in their own country because of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --all of our affairs [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- elsewhere and [SIGH] [NOISE] everyone's pulling their belt tighter and no one want to spend or [SIGH] anything like that.  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly, I --
L:  So, ...
R:  -- I think that, ah, [SIGH] they're trying -- like you said -- trying to blame, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- on something that's going on.  I think that they're -- they're trying to use war as a way as a way to get out of it in a way.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Ye- --
R:  I feel that they're trying to use some sort of distraction, [SIGH] something to get our morale up again so that, ah, we would end up, ah --
L:  [NOISE]  That's right.
R:  -- [SIGH] getting f- faith back in our economy a- and, unfortunately, at least at this time it hasn't happened.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [SIGH] and so now we're bringing up the Martha Stewart affair again.
L:  Oh, I feel so bad for her.  [NOISE]  You know, I do.  Even if it -- [SIGH] not because it's a female that's i- in a problem right now 'cause I think [NOISE] a- approaching that issue that way is -- is ridiculous.
R:  Right, I mean --
L:  I mean they're trying to play on that too, "Is it because she's a female?" and, you know, [SIGH] "Females don't belong in that".  Ah, that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a bunch of crap.  [LAUGH]  I don't -- I don't [NOISE] believe in that.  [SIGH] [NOISE]  But I --
R:  Well, [NOISE] --
L:  -- I think it's [NOISE] terrible that they're trying to take [NOISE] t- the attention of the Americans and place it elsewhere and use her [SIGH] as the pansy.
R:  Right, exactly.  And what happened with Enron; what happened with Worldcom.  Um, and --
L:  A- any corporate.
R:  -- we don't hear about those any more.
L:  Any of them.
R:  And now they're trying to find another victim.  They're -- that -- that she's the only one that, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] they, I guess, can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pick on at this time --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- so they've decided that today t- they're going to use her for a distraction.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  All of a sudden it's the FBI doesn't like -- the FBI and the CIA doesn't like being [SIGH] lied to.
R:  Right.
L:  What are you talking about?  They lie to each [LAUGH] o- other.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  [SIGH]  If they were so busy telling the truth we wouldn't have a problem with our safety in this country.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Another thing that they've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- said on there they said, "Has this affected you in any way?"  I'd say, "Yes".  I mean, a- ah, it ha- -- I think it's affected, ah, ... all of us in some sort -- way or another, especially financially.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes, cost everyone of us.
R:  Plus we're a little bit more afraid to, ah, [SIGH] stick our neck out --
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and spend the dollar nev- -- not knowing what's around the corner and whether we're gonna need it in the future.  [SIGH]
L:  That's right.
R:  We ... we're all, ah, a little scared about, ah, [SIGH] this s- situation as it is right now, and --
L:  I mean it's kind of scary when you have the President saying, "Look, I put, i- in a big tax break [SIGH] --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- [SIGH] and I did this so that the --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- Americans they'd get a refund or a larger bite.  --"
R:  [SIGH]
L:  "-- [SIGH]  Take that and puts it away".
R:  Right.
L:  A- ah, instead of him saying, you know, "Guys here's some money now you can do what you want"  He's even scared, I mean, that's sentence alone.  [SIGH]  "Look I would like t- the American public to take that extra bit and m- maybe put it away".  [SIGH]  Why?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Instead of saying, "G- get that extra thing you need.  [NOISE]  Pay off the college loans.  Do ..." [SIGH]  No.
R:  I think he's run out of, ah, answers.  As I said, I think he tried to use all this distraction away to turn things around that didn't --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- happen and right now he's at a loss as to, ah, how to go about, ah, [SIGH] maybe, [SIGH] ah, taking a different tack to, ah, change the situation as it is.  Unfortunately, [SIGH] um, [MN] we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- didn't buy into the war, ah, in the way that they were expecting that maybe we'd all start spending freely, things are going to be great because, --
L:  N- no.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, there's still too many loose ends and too many, ah [SIGH] -- ah, areas that are -- are, ah, [SIGH] --ah, we don't have answers in -- at.
L:  If they looked back and they seen that [NOISE] at all times whenever [NOISE] this country has gone to war [SIGH] people --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- have always tightened the belt --
R:  [NOISE]  Exactly.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and r- really didn't go out there and s- spend or anything like that because --
R:  And after World War Two we had, ah, --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- it -- it was a while -- it took until the fifties before everything started, ah, coming back together again and e- everybody was, ah, feeling comfortable enough, ah, to be able to, [SIGH] ah, live the way they felt they ... w- wanted to live and, ah, buy things they wanted to buy.  [SIGH]
L:  That's right.
R:  [SIGH]  Now there's no su- -- even though we're in a fast food society nowadays --
L:  Oh, it's disgusting.
R:  -- there's still no quick fixes and nothing is going to be instant.
L:  That is disgusting, this [LAUGH] f- fast food thing.  Don't even get me on that one because I say that's the -- the great American past time, [SIGH] stuffing their faces.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Look at our country.  Everybody is ... f- fat.
R:  Right.
L:  It -- it's such a shame.  I say, [SIGH] "Knock them all down and get rid of them".
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know about you but when we were kids [NOISE] we -- we were very healthy.  [SIGH]  Healthy.  I'm only forty years old and we were healthy.  My mother always said to us, "You start getting big" everything went away [SIGH] no more past- -- Italian pastries, none of that crap [NOISE] and here we got [SIGH] fast food.  You could just walk right in and get it, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- right then and there.
R:  Right.
L:  No, people eating out of their cars and, n- n- nah.
R:  That -- I think that's one area a- actually that probably has not been hit that bad is, ah, --
L:  Food!
R:  -- with the economy if food.  Right.  Right. 
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
R:  Um, that's one thing that it's now not looked on as a, ah, luxury --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's, [SIGH] ah, something that we have to have every day.
L:  Ye- --
R:  And, un- --
L:  [NOISE]  That's right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- unfortunately, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not going to turn the economy around.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Isn't that something.  [SIGH]  And I -- I think another reason why people aren't out there spending is because we're not as comfortable as ... the President would have liked us to have been now that w- we've gone into Iraq and done what we've done --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] but there's still the issue behind in our minds of ... Bin Laden.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  What about him?  I mean is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- America just supposed to go [NOISE] "Well, that's it, we're done, finished".  N- no.
R:  And still there's no firm proof, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, Hussein's gone.
L:  There -- there -- no, there isn't.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  You know, we haven't found any evidence yet that they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that he has a -- not underground versus being dead.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And -- or nor his sons.  Um --
L:  That's right.  [NOISE]  That's right.
R:  -- and -- and we want answers.
L:  I'm kind of wondering why they would ask this type of question about [NOISE] c- corporate [SIGH] when they real- [LAUGH] -- when they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really should have asked [NOISE] a- another question.  I -- I what a- are they fishing for something to ... blame or [SIGH] what's going on?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know [SIGH] it's a shame.  I think --
R:  I --
L:  -- I -- I wish the President would come out and ... just have an open forum from each state and just allow [SIGH] the different towns to come together and be able to speak to him, [NOISE] ah, through the television.  Everything is reality.  You want reality?  Why don't you speak to the people and get it?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, let's see, one of the things that has happened was, ah, the area that I used to work in which was cabling was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing the cat three cat vibe which is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- telephone lines and computer, ah, [SIGH] lines --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- installations in businesses, ah, back in the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- late nineties.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  It was fine up until t- the point where, ah, the Internet started going under.  [SIGH]  Ah, unfortunately, I've had to change careers because --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- ah, that's one of the areas that was ... hit hard.  Nobody's expanding any more.  Everybody, as you said, is tightening their belt.  [SIGH]  So, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the extra expenditure went, ah, out the door.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  People are getting laid off.  A- areas of business are being affected, ah, --
L:  That's right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- sharply by it a- and I -- I have yet -- I -- I've moved from California to Missouri to Florida and now I'm in New Jersey and I --
L:  Are you in Jersey?  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- yes, I have not found [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- ah, the jobs [SIGH] in -- in any --
L:  In anywhere.
R:  -- I -- I even do computers and --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and -- I -- I had to get out of that area because there's just nothing in there --
L:  Isn't that something.  I know someone that is an ath- -- he's an IT [SIGH] manager --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and he's also [NOISE] had -- has the same problem.  [NOISE]  Not able to find the work whereas once [NOISE] he was [SIGH] r- running --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- a start up and h- -- you know, making a hundred and eight thousand a year.  [NOISE]  And now, he's -- two years later [NOISE] there's no work --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] to be found.
R:  Well, I, [SIGH] ah, have to say that, ah, [SIGH] unfortunately it was a little scary the other day in the paper here, local paper, [SIGH] there's now a group [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, that they have formed.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's kind of like an AA group except it's for those people that have been un- -- unemployed for a -- a -- a length of time --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the average person now has been out of work for, ah, six months.  [SIGH]  And they're saying that the numbers that they're giving in the way of unemployment, ah, have been [SIGH] greatly under exaggerated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] that we're probably looking at more closer to at least ten percent, [SIGH] ah, unemployment rate versus the seven, eight percent --
L:  That's right --
R:  -- that they're stating right now.
L:  -- there's an awful lot.  [NOISE]
R:  So, there is -- [SIGH] you know, there are, ah, there's a lot of cover up going on.
L:  Yes, there is, [SIGH] because I --
R:  And --
L:  --I come from the State of Massachussetts, and [SIGH] if you know Massachussetts, an awful lot of businesses are going down.  [NOISE]
R:  Really?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, [NOISE] y- y- yeah, an awful lot, [NOISE] I mean --
R:  That's [NOISE] --
L:  -- Polaroid is trying to save itself.  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're actually, ah, p- possibly going to be +moving there shortly, Boston as a matter of fact because --
L:  Are you moving to Boston?  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, -- ah, we will be moving.  We have a -- I have one of the vendors that I currently work with at the business I'm at is wanting to put his business on the Internet and, in that area that is probably one of the only [SIGH] areas that it is, ah, a viable b- business, ah, source right now is, or I should say, economical source is [SIGH] people [SIGH] buying gifts for others on line.
L:  Yes, --
R:  Um, that -- that --
L:  -- yes, it is.
R:  -- well, that's currently where I'm working at as a company that does that and you would not believe the ... money people will pay [SIGH] to have, ah, [SIGH] items sent to each other.
L:  That's -- you're r- right.  You're -- you're absolutely right.  [NOISE]
R:  And unfortunately that [SIGH] business that I work for, the guy has not had a bo- -- firm business plan ever in place.  [SIGH]  He's basically, --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- ah, [SIGH] letting it take its course and it only goes to show both me and, ah, this person I know of in Boston that, a- ah, put together properly and run properly there can --
L:  Oh, yo- --
R:  -- can be a lot of money to be made.
L:  -- that's right as long as you have someone manning it the right way.
R:  Right.
