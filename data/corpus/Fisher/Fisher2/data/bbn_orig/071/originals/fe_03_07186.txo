R:  [NOISE] Oh, that's sad, but do you still keep in touch over the phone or --
L:  Oh, yeah, my best friend, we talk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at least every other day.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, because her, um, boyfriend has a cell phone that she gets free minutes after nine and on the weekends so --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- that's how we do most of our talking.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  So, that's a good thing and --

L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I have two daughters that are nine.

R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- keep an eye out for me on her, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's sweet.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  She lives with my mother but, yeah, my one friend I talk to, ah, actually, our parents were best friends --
R:  Uh-huh, huh.
L:  -- and we grew up together.
R:  [NOISE] So you grew up together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Wow, I know my husband has a lot of friends he grew up with and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] I don't and that's --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- [NOISE] I wish.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- I did but you lose contact over the years, you know, you get married, you have kids and --
R:  [NOISE] Mm, yeah, that's true.
L:  -- this one goes this way and this one goes that way, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what, I probably can't do this, but I have to run and get my cordless, can you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- hang on one second.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Sorry, I have something on the grill and it's, like, oh my god, I have to get this phone call, but why --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- why do you find it hard to trust [NOISE] people?  Shh.
R:  I don't know, I guess I'm not a very good judge of character and all the friends that I've ever had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just turned out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sweet and then end up, you know, doing things that, um, hurt me or --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  [NOISE] That's -- that's rotten.
R:  Yeah, so I -- I have acquaintances, I just don't have any true, true friends, you know, I wish I did.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  I just, I've tried and everyone that I've been friends with --
L:  [NOISE] There.
R:  -- has turned out to be not so good of a person, you know.
L:  [NOISE] No -- yeah -- friends -- you don't need --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- friends like that.  Most of my friends, they don't [NOISE] I've -- I never really got stabbed in the back too many times, in -- in school and that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but [NOISE] --
R:  -- I -- I've had -- well, my best friends have been guys, so far; m- males.
L:  Well, I've had lot -- I had lots of best friends that were guys, there's nothing wrong with that.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  [NOISE] Except that the husbands get jealous.
R:  Yeah, the husband doesn't like it, so I had to, you know, lose contact with a bunch of them but, ah, from my experiences, th- the guys have really been my true friends, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've never done anything that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just the women that I've been friends with that have done lots of stuff, I don't even want to go into that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  But I find it hard trusting people now and, um --
L:  Well, the -- when you have bad situations like that that's how it's hard, um --
R:  Yeah, but, um --
L:  -- it's hard to start to gain trust in people.
R:  Yeah, I have lots of acquaintances though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I do have friends; I just don't have any true friends.
L:  Yeah, no, I have my --
R:  You never --
L:  -- my best friend, Sue --
R:  Yeah, she --
L:  -- and another friend, Gladys, back home. and there are some guys which, they call me every so often 'cause I used to work with, but my husband doesn't say nothing [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause I'll smack him.  [LAUGH] Well, they're -- they're married, the ones, you know, a lot older than me and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, it's just friendly we, um, you know, we bonded at work 'cause I worked with them.
R:  Yeah, I've -- I've had some friends that, um, I met through work --
L:  [NOISE].
R:  -- and stuff, I've -- I just don't really trust them, that's all.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I have a friend that I used to hang out in high school and another friend, um, that I lost contact with because her husband was in the service and she moved to Germany --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she bought this alumni year book that they had back to people that were in early nineteen hundreds that graduated from the school and she happened to find my name in it and she called me and I keep in touch with her once in a while and she gave me an- another friend that I lost contact with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- because she moved to California and I recently talked to her right before I moved down here and here she --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was back, she'd been back in the area for years and it's, like, oh my god, all this time.
R:  I know, how weird, and it's kind of weird how you all, um, got back in, um, to talking and stuff through the --
L:  But now I don- -- I can't see her because I just got -- I just -- I made contact with her about, maybe, two weeks before I moved out of state.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I didn't get to see her but, in fact, I ought to give her a call, I haven't talked to her since I'm down here.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, since we're on the subject of friends, huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But, yeah, I -- I do, I keep in c- contact with -- with -- with h- da- da- which is with Sue all the time because she has a lot of problems and she calls me and I try to steer her the right way because she's one that doesn't trust a lot of people either.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.  I would --
L:  And she -- she has a few friends but she doesn't have a lot.  Not one that she can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- talk to about anything.  Me, I -- I don't care what it is, I'll talk to her about anything, you know what I mean?
R:  Y- yeah, um, ah, god, where are the people like that [LAUGH] that I could meet, I mean, god ... I wish I had friends like that.
L:  Yeah, it's nice to have friends like that when you ha- -- you know, I had problems with at home or something, I don't like --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to let my family know everything.
R:  Oh, yeah, I know --
L:  And --
R:  -- tell me about it.  I've --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- made mistakes of talking to my sister in laws about some stuff and one in particular, she's a real, you know, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two face and she'll --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tell everybody what's going --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on and then I'll hear about it and my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- husband told m- -- told me about her but I just didn't listen.  He always tells me about --
L:  You had to find out for yourself.
R:  -- yeah, he always tells me about the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people that I think are my friends and he just sees it right of the bat that they're not any good, and then I tell him, "No.  She goes to church, she's fine, you know, she's this and that and" --
L:  Church doesn't -- just because people go to church it doesn't mean nothing sometimes, they're the worst.
R:  [LAUGH] I know, they're -- tell me about -- they are.
L:  Because there were two guys at work, I mean I was friends with them but I just t- talked to them, you know, th- th- the little as I had to because they were both church goers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were the worst -- two worst workers there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But because they were church and -- and, you know, they -- the one used to be drinking and drugs and he --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- him and his wife flipped, did a three hundred and sixty degree turn and he turned out to be useless --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and because he, excuse me when I call him a holy roller, but because he gets that way, you know, his --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- boss praises him, which was my boss, and it's, like, "Why?"
R:  Y- yeah, th- --
L:  W- why, he doesn't do his job, he loathes and so does the other one and it's, like, why do they get away with it.
R:  [LAUGH] Just because everyone knows that they go to church or something, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- no I never, that's one thing I never understood, but --
R:  Yeah, this --
L:  -- friends are good to have.  [SIGH] Sometimes they're not, but like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I said, I've had problems with, you know, two or three but -- and then I tell my daughter the same thing, you know, you always have to have more than one friend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to hang around with different people because if you get in an argument with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that one they get ev- -- turn everybody against and then who do you have?  No one.
R:  I've never thought of it that way.
L:  No.
R:  But that's some good advice, that's --
L:  Then she -- she did learn because that happened to her one time and she got in a fight and I said, "Now, they're going to try and turn half your friends against ya", and they did, and I said, "See, that's why --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you need to have -- you have to hang around with different groups of friends", and then --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she had a friend and then [COUGH] that friend turned out to get trashy and I said, "Jessica, just because she's trashy and you're friends with her and you go places doesn't mean you are, so what, that's her life, it's not you, people know you, don't worry about --"
R:  Yes.
L:  -- her and her reputation.  Just worry about yourself.  It doesn't mean you cannot be friends with that per- --
