L:  Francine. [NOISE]
R:  Er, hi, I'm Fred.
L:  Hi. [NOISE]
R:  Um, I've never actually done this before, but I guess we're supposed to talk about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, whether we like cold weather --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or warm weather activities?
L:  I guess so.  This is my first phone call, too. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  I --
L:  Well, I live in -- in Wyoming, so it's cold most of the time here.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I, actually, I live in New Mexico right now and, uh, oh, it's warm most of the time here so, uh --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- I tend to, you know, like getting outside, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, playing some basketball every now and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or, uh, trying to teach my son how to do a few things.  But, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've also been in a -- lived in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cold weather states like Michigan so, I don't know, I like --
L:  I -- yeah, I was raised in California so I grew up doing the warm weather stuff.  But I've got kids out here that [LAUGH] are used to the cold weather stuff, though.
R:  Yeah, it's, uh --
L:  But --
R:  Uh, I don't know, I guess to me personally I would like it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I like both --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the, uh, [MN] I probably like 'em equally because depending on where -- where I am it allows me to go outside and, you know, I remember being a kid and, uh, you know, playing in the snow --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fort and things like that and ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, kinda -- kinda don't get the chance to do that out in New Mexico.
L:  [NOISE] No, I imagine not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my kids built a [NOISE] -- an igloo just this last winter. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah, they like playing in the snow but I would prefer the warm weather stuff.  I like to be out, you know, going swimming and taking the kids to the park and stuff.  Can't do that in the snow, so ... [NOISE]
R:  No, yeah, that's true.  I -- you know, I tend to actually, uh, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one of my kids is, uh, one now so he's able to walk around --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and just loves the outside, so ...
L:  Oh, all of my kids love -- I got four girls and they all love being outside.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Doesn't matter if it's cold or warm, they don't care, they just wanna be outside.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  [MN] And then, uh, was there something else that we were supposed to -- was there another topic?
L:  I don't think so.  I think it's just the --
R:  [NOISE] We- --
L:  -- whether you like cold or warm and what sports, I guess, I think you liked outside, or what outdoor activities?
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I mean, especially, I mean, I essentially like all sports.  I mean, you know, baseball, you know, playing that outside --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or, you know, volleyball.  Ah, actually I lived in California, too, so [SIGH] -- so I got to go to the beach every now and then as well, so ...
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] that's why [NOISE] I like to be at the beach, and there's no beaches here.  We go to the lake every now and then.  It's nice up there.  The girls like to fish. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh ...
R:  Yeah, it's kinda, uh, I've lived in Michigan, California, and, uh, New Mexico, and, uh, there's no beaches as long as I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can think of out here, so that's definitely one thing I miss living here, is, you know, just not being able to go and see water for miles. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  My, uh, youngest has never seen a beach, never been on a beach.  My second youngest has been on one, but she was so little she doesn't remember it.  So, it's weird to me to think 'cause I was used to -- you know, we went to the beach numerous times every summer as I grew up and I was, you know, always at the beach and for them not to even know what it's like, it's just kinda strange, but ...
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  That's why we --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we try and take 'em -- we have, like, little, um, [LIPSMACK] reservoirs and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There -- there's one near our house that we go to and they get to swim, and there's little fish in the bottom that like to nibble your toes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Kids love that.  They try to feed 'em crackers and chips.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we're actually getting ready to, uh, go on a family trip back -- back to Michigan to see the family, so I'm planning on taking everybody over to the beach and showing 'em, you know, here -- here's what beaches are supposed to be like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Here's what you're supposed to do in the summer.
L:  This is what it looks like. [LAUGH] Yeah.  Otherwise I just like to be out with the kids.  We go to the park and, you know, hang out with friends there and stuff, but they just -- they like to play outside and do whatever and we just sit outside and watch 'em, so ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's --
L:  But ...
R:  -- what I tend to -- tend to do right now as well, just, uh -- although my little one, he tends to wanna pull me around the entire yard and, uh, uh, point to the ball and have me run and go get it, so ...
L:  Of course, of course.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my youngest is gonna be two next month and that's -- she wants to do everything herself.  She's at that age where she's outside and she wants to do what the big kids are doing and she can't do it so [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  So ...
L:  But --
R:  But, I mean, you know, and the -- the winter activities, they're fun but, uh, I don't know, I guess, uh, well, 'specially living out here, the thing that I remember about being good about winter stuff is that you can always bundle up to get warmer while you're outside, but out -- down here, there's nothing you can do when it's really warm outside to --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- cool down.
L:  That's true.  Here in Wyoming it's either really cold or really hot, it just -- and it's dry here.  I mean, out in California, you know, there was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the ocean blowing some moisture in, and out here it's not so when it gets hot it is just stifling hot and, oh, I can't stand it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I used --
L:  Then when it gets cold it gets really cold. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I used to live in the valley in LA and, uh, [SIGH] uh, I -- I guess the difference here is -- is that probably the same up there, from what you're describing, is that when it's eighty five or -- here it just doesn't -- I mean, 'cause there's no humidity at all.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  So, it -- you know, when I'm -- when I'm talking to friends or family from either California or Michigan and I say, "Well, it's eighty five" and they're, "Wow, you must by dying" and I'm like, "Well, no, not actually" [NOISE].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But yeah, you know, uh, yeah, I'm looking out in my backyard and I got just tons of balls everywhere from the kids and, ah ...
L:  My mom has gone crazy.  She's got one of those huge trampolines out in her yard.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And she bought this big old wooden swing -- uh, swing set that's got a fort built on to it and a slide and all the different stuff attached to it and they have a -- one of those battery operated Barbie cars, scooters, bikes, so they're always outside playing something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we keep lo- --
L:  Chasing them down the road.
R:  We keep looking at those trampolines.
L:  Oh, my kids -- my mom got the one with the net around the outside and the kids just have a ball on that thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They just -- I mean, they jump and run and play.  Even my little one likes to get on there and be bounced around.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We, uh, uh, planted a whole ton of grass out here to kinda remind me of back home, although it's not very New Mexican.  And my wife keeps telling me I'm gonna have to dig up half of it and put --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- put my play yard there or something and [SIGH] so ... I'm sure it'll happen some day.
L:  Out here outside it's usually really -- e- everybody pictures Wyoming mountains, is what they picture, these big, green, lush trees and -- and that's not what Wyoming is.  Wyoming outside is always looks dead, everything's yellow and dead.  And this year we got a lot of rain so everything's green.  My best friend came back to visit and she's like, "I've never seen Wyoming like this" [LAUGH] 'cause usually outside, I mean, it's just -- everything looks dead 'cause we don't get a whole lot of moisture.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And so -- and this year everything is just really green and just growing non stop and [LIPSMACK] so, of course, everyone's allergies are acting up outside but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it looks nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we don't -- see, that's another thing good about out here is 'cause there's not a lot of moisture we don't tend to -- you know, there's not a lot of allergies out here but, uh, and -- and I mean, I'm -- I -- I don't normally hit -- hit any of that anyways, but, uh --
L:  I -- I -- I didn't in California but out here I do so I like being outside in California.  Out here I try to stay indoors so my allergies don't act up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the kids are always wanting to be outside, so I'm usually out with 'em.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, my -- my youngest, he just loves watering things right now so --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- got some plants.
L:  My nine year old has been like that since she was that age.  I'm just -- every time she goes out, "Can I use the hose?  Can I water the lawn?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so I guess, uh, sounds like we're both in agreement that the -- the warmer outside is a lot better.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, when it gets cold you have to worry about the kids getting sick because, you know, they don't keep their jackets on or they take their gloves off and then they come in, "My hands are cold" and [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I prefer the warm weather, definitely.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I guess my -- my next major, major purchase would have to be a pool or something like that, but ...
L:  Mine have been bugging me.  We have those little tiny ones, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that you can basically [NOISE] stick your feet in and that's about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have a couple of those sitting outside and that's it.  The girls [NOISE] -- shush. [NOISE] Okay, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's because you loaded it wrong.  Just go open the lid. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cathy, go open the lid. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Doing laundry.  My nine year old didn't load the washer right.  Anyway ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I hear ya.
L:  [SIGH] But, yeah, they wa- -- they're wanting a big pool, that's what they keep asking for.  They wanna set up a pool outside to sit in --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- 'cause when it gets hot they're like, "We wanna go swimming". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've seen some of those at, like, uh, you know, Sam's Club and the like, of where it's like three hundred dollars for, like, one of those big, big, big blow up ones.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I just keep -- I just keep seeing, like, you know, my dog -- I got two big dogs -- running into it or something and popping and [MN] --
L:  I had -- a few years ago I bought one.  It wasn't real big, it was, like, twelve feet by [NOISE] six feet or something like that.  It wasn't real big but it was -- it was one of those blow up ones.  My cats liked to walk on the edge --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to get to the water and drink the water, and they put holes in it.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Doesn't work --
