L:  Mike.
R:  Ah, my name's Marilyn. [COUGH] Um, well, let's see.  Do you wanna go first or do you want me to?
L:  Ladies first, Marilyn.  Nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you.  Where are you from?
L:  Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  Okay, and I'm from Seattle.
L:  Huh.
R:  [COUGH] Um, well, let's see, we're supposed to talk about friends, right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and whether we have a l- -- a -- a large number or a smaller number.
L:  [NOISE] Right, according to the -- I have the, ah, friends question in front of me and it goes like this, "Are either of you the type of person [MN] who has lots of friends and acquaintances, or do you just have a few close friends?  Each of you should talk about your best friend or friends". [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  Good.  Ah, did you get that off the Internet?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Um, well, let's see, I would say I tend to have, um, a pretty large number of friends and acquaintances.  Um, I -- I -- I went to school at Washington State University and have stayed in touch with, um, a whole group of sorority sisters that I went to school with and -- and their husbands as well and so we see each other periodically and send Christmas cards and have a -- an Apple Cup Party, um, every other year at our house, ah, when, [COUGH] ah, the University of Washington [inaudible] play over here in Seattle.  So that's one source and then I have --
L:  What's -- what's a cup party?
R:  Oh, ah, I'm sorry.  Apple Cup Party.
L:  Apple Cup Party.
R:  Apple Cup is, [MN] you know, we raise a lot of apples in this state and [COUGH] so the two big colleges in the state, they just have nicknamed it the Apple Cup, um, Football Competition and so, ah, we've used that as a vehicle to have a -- a party and people can go to the game and then come to the party or, um --
L:  I see.
R:  Or just come, you know, and visit and ... I -- we have a fairly large number of friends through our church, which is just half a block away, and, um, let's see, I -- so anyway, to answer that part of it, I would say we have quite a number of [NOISE] [COUGH] of friends and, um, it's hard to say exactly my best friend.  Um, I -- I've been very close friends for fifty years with this woman who -- with whom I went to college, but, um, maybe right now we're not as close as we once were because our -- our lives have taken different paths, but over the years we've been very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- supportive of each other.  Our kids are -- are -- are friends and, um, you know, if I had a problem or she had a problem, we could talk about it together and get ideas and advice and -- and we have done that.  So anyway, um, I'm not keeping track of the time, but maybe that's enough for -- for now and then you can talk and then we'll go back and forth or --
L:  Well, sure --
R:  -- what do you think?
L:  -- that sounds good.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, I -- uh, conversely, I, um, I, ah, have -- I'd rather have a small -- smaller group of friends that I can count on wheth- -- rather than just acquaintances, because, heck, I learnt from when I was ten years old, that [SIGH] quality not quantity is better in terms of friendships because the fringe on the -- friends on the freng- -- fringe sometimes are friends to your face, but may not necessarily be there when you need them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I have kind of a different view.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] But, ah, I do have close relationships with, ah, folks from college and, um, you know, from, you know, neighbors and -- and other friends from -- from bygone days.  As a matter of fact, ah, I was kinda the re- receiving party of, ah, some very close friends of ours.  We used to live in the Detroit area --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  And it, ah, I -- I -- I was there for them, gosh, uh, in a big way, oh, about three, four months ago.  Ah, she had to send her daughter, who I last saw was fourteen but now she's in her early twenties, she had to literally send her daughter down with her two kids on a moment's notice, because of a domestic violence situation.
R:  Oh, wow.  Mhm.
L:  So I kind of, ah, inherited her and, um, kinda made -- she's kinda my adopted niece now, um, as a matter of fact, I just --
R:  Well, that's -- that's wonderful. [LAUGH]
L:  -- just emailed her, yeah.  [SIGH] She, ah -- [MN] she was, ah -- he was, ah, I guess in jail for domestic violence and, ah, was getting out and, of course, you know, it was, uh, my -- lack of planning on their part was an emergency on my part [LAUGH] because, ah, she called and she said, "You know, hey, I -- I need to get Michelle away from this guy.  And, ah, and, ah, you know, can you help s- -- provide her housing?  So- -- or can -- can you help look for her -- look for a house there in a safe neighborhood with her kids?"  [SIGH] And so, ah --
R:  How many kids does she -- did she have?
L:  Ah --
R:  How many kids did she have?
L:  Two.
R:  Two, yeah.
L:  Two, just the two year old and a one year old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, boy, for the, ah, for the next three or four days subsequent to that phone call, I must have seen twelve houses [LAUGH].
R:  Mm, mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, selected about three or four candidates, ah, f- for housing that, ah, she came down and, ah, she, um, you know, she really, ah, really appreciated my, ah, my help there.
R:  Well, of course, yeah, yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Very, ah, difficult and -- and frightening time for her, I'm sure.
L:  And I'm also a -- a part -- an amateur attorney, if you will, and a part time counselor to -- I'm a christian and it's kinda -- and I happen to be good at it.  I really don't particularly enjoy it to be ho- -- quite honest, but I happen to be good at it.  So, um, you know, as so many cases, the domestic violence, ah, ah, um, she wanted to, ah, after some searching, I guess, wanted to continue the relationship with her husband --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  -- so I had, ah, meet with her individually for a counseling session and then I met with both of them together and then I met with him separately and [SIGH] it was really a [SIGH] -- a real [LAUGH] challenge to me.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  But I invested --
R:  I have a background --
L:  -- m- -- many, many hours --
R:  -- oh, excuse me.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I was going to say I've been a social worker, and so I -- I un- understand [MN] the kinda thing you are doing and -- and it isn't easy.
L:  No, it's not.  But, you know, it's like I say, "God's given me the skill and [SIGH] so I, ah, I, um, you know, I -- I do it for -- to be a servant, basically".
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  But, ah, but, you know, just to kinda keep on topic, why, I have some good friends here that, ah, here in Nashville, that, ah, I enjoy and some acquaintances too, and it appears just like I said, when I was a young lad, uh, it seems like the ones on the fringe kinda -- [MN] they're -- like, I said, I -- I normally would rather have, uh, quality not quantity.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  I'm not really a fraternity or soc- -- or, ah, you know, social organization, um, sorority kinda [SIGH] person myself, I'm really not a joiner in that kind of way, so, ah, in some ways I wish I had, but in some ways I'm kinda glad I didn't, bec- -- just because of all the, I don't know, all that peer stuff that goes on in the college setting.  I'm not really one to go -- go along with the crowd, if you will.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  [MN] But I mean, close -- close friends, um, you know, I have a -- a friend here, Gary Wayne, that, ah, if he's down in the dumps he'll say, "Hey, you know, let's have a nightcap together", or [SIGH] -- or, uh, if I, uh, need to just go blow off some steam, I'll go over there and, ah, you know, I'll have a nightcap with him, and it seems to be that, ah, whenever we need each other, we're there for each other --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a big way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you --
R:  That's a --
L:  -- can't trade that for a million dollars.
R:  No.  No, and I think that's probably a -- a good definition of a friend, who is being there for the other one and -- and being a good listener too.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um --
L:  Sounds like you've been blessed.  With your quantity of friends that are quality --
R:  Well --
L:  -- as well.
R:  Y- yeah, I -- I -- I -- consider it a real blessing and, ah, try to -- try to be a good friend.  We, ah, we laugh, ah, um, because most of us are not, um, big, um, sorority people in as far as being active in alum- alumni group etcetera, but we are really good friends with each other and -- and our spouses -- our husbands have been good friends to each other too, and -- and, ah, and so that's, um, that -- that is a blessing and it -- and it's very nice, um, so i- it's a good -- a good thing and --
