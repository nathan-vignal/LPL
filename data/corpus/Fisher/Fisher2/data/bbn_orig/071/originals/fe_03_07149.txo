L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Lau- my name's Laura.
R:  Uh, where are you from, Laura?
L:  Uh, New York.
R:  New York?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  I'm Chris.  I'm from Pennsylvania.  
L:  Oh, not too far away.  
R:  No, not too far.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  Um, I -- what they said about ou- outdoor, um, or warm weather and cold weather.  I like both.  So I'm [MN] --
R:  You like both?
L:  -- I pre- -- 
R:  You like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You like cold? [MN]
L:  I like both.  
R:  Oh, both.  
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]  I like both as long as it's outdoors.  I don't care.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  As long as it's not too hot, I don't mind.  [LAUGH]  Uh, I mean, if -- I'd be happy if it was inbetween.  [LAUGH]  But I'm not mu- --
L:  Yeah, well that's the best.  
R:  Yeah, well, I'm not much of a cold person and -- and I hate the heat so ...  [LAUGH]  But, hey, if -- if I'm doing something it better than just sitting. 
L:  Yep.  Yeah.
R:  It doesn't, uh -- I guess, what would it -- well, I guess my favorite would be [LAUGH] indoors 'cause it would be air conditioned.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  
R:  But I --
L:  What would you want to do indoors that's, uh ...?
R:  Um, I guess ...  Well, I exercise indoors.  I --
L:  Oh, like on a gym?
R:  Y- -- uh, no.  In- indoor -- in -- in my house.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, uh, if my daughter said -- wanted to go outside and play, you know, I take 'em outside to play.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  You gotta let kids run around.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  So ...  
L:  I prefer to be outdoors and like rollerblading or bicycling or ...
R:  Uh.
L:  Uh, doing stuff that's gonna get me somewhere.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Well, I've never tried rollerblading but I've been ro- roller skating.  But I've never tried rollerblading.  
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's not too -- it's kind of like inbetween roller skating and, uh, ice skating.
R:  Oh, do you like ice skating?  I've only been once.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So I don't -- it looks a little tricky.  
L:  It's -- it's not too bad.  It's just it takes I think more energy out of your legs, uh, than, like, regular roll- roller skating.
R:  Oh, yeah, where you have the four roll -- four --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wheels.  
L:  Yeah.  Just side by side and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] one and, yeah, in the other.
R:  I hear it's good exercise though.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's real good [LAUGH] exercise. 
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep, it's good exercise but, um, I do -- I do just about as much in the winter except for, uh, like cross country skiing or snowmobiling.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Or downhill skiing.
R:  Wow, you really [LAUGH] -- you're really an outdoor person though, aren't you?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [inaudible].
L:  I'd rather -- I'd rather do stuff outdoors than indoors.  
R:  Wow.  Really.  [MN]
L:  If I'm indoors I'm a couch potato. 
R:  Are [LAUGH] you?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I try not to be.  But you find yourself, you know, I'm too tired.  I just want to sit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, so how is -- uh, how's the weather in New York?
L:  Beautiful today.  It was almost eighty.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Today was grey here and I'm just tired of the rain.  
L:  Yeah.  No, it didn't rain here at all today.  It was actually, uh, quite nice -- 
R:  It was kind of --
L:  -- all day.  
R:  -- misty today.  But, uh, yesterday's was horrible.
L:  Uh.  It -- it rained -- it drizzled yesterday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was about it.  
R:  It poured here.  All day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's -- Friday was very nice.  Nice and sunny.  So we're kind of worried.  We go on vacation, uh, on the fifteenth.  Next Sunday.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we're going to Wirewood[?].
L:  Is that in Ohio?  Right?
R:  No.  Wirewood, New Jersey.  
L:  Oh, New Jersey.  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  No, could be a Wirewood in Ohio for all I know.
L:  No, I was thinking of, I think, Cedar Rapids.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, cause a -- a friend of mine just went there to the amusement park.
R:  Oh.  So we're --
L:  But Wirewood is like, uh, [MN] near, uh, on the coast, right?  It's kind of like, uh ...
R:  Jersey shore.  Yeah.  By the ocean.
L:  Yeah.  It's kinda like a -- is it a campground?
R:  No.  No.  It's got a boardwalk and rides and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a beach and, uh, it's about an hour from Atlantic City.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh, so we're a little worried about what the weather's gonna be down there.  Since it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been so [MN] --
L:  Lousy.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But not really a wet spring. 
R:  Oh, I'm just tired of it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And late spring, actually.
R:  Yes.  If it -- if it's gonna come.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  It may just jump to summer.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But we need the rain.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I guess [MN] --
L:  Oh, yeah.  After last year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Last year it was such a drought.  
R:  Uh-huh.  And this year it's like come on already.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, we want -- we need the rain but, hello.  I think it's getting everybody's moods really low because there's no sun.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess you can't get to go outside.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  No.
R:  To do your stuff.  
L:  No.  We went, uh, we had a really, uh, actually a good winter as far as snow goes, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're out doing snow- -- you know, uh, snow activities.  So ...
R:  Yeah, we had one or two --
L:  So it wasn't bad.
R:  -- maybe three.
L:  We had -- we had solid snow on the ground for probably eight weeks so ...  Which  a lot of times we'll get like a thaw.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Where the snow come and you just never have that base.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...  But, uh ...
R:  [MN]  So are you from -- where in New York?
L:  Uh, um, outside of Rochester.  Right down to Lake Ontario.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, uh, you know, we get a lot more snow than like down, you know, down state.
R:  Oh, if you're behind the -- yeah.  If you're by the lake.  
L:  Yeah.  And, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  So there's a lot to do, you know.  There are worse times of the years, like, you know, March and April and it's too cold to really go outside and do anything but, y- you know ...
R:  May.
L:  And the snow's gone so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and the last time I was in New York we -- my husband and I refer[?] -- we had our kids.  It was ninety eight.  We took the train and spent the day in the city.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And went to, um ...
L:  [MN]  You -- you said you were, uh, [MN] down by Philly?
R:  Um, I'm about fifteen minutes away from Philly.
L:  Oh, so you're not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- far at all from New York City.  I mean, that's what?  An --
R:  No. No.
L:  -- hour and a half ride or ...
R:  An hour and a half, two hours.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's not really too far.  
L:  You're a lot closer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than we are.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?
L:  More like [inaudible] -- yeah, we're a -- just about a six hour drive. 
R:  To New York City?
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I guess I think, oh, New York, you know.  You automatically think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- New York City.  But, uh, I know somebody who grew up in California and she said when she was dating her future husband that he was, like, three hours away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm like, "But it's California".  She goes, "Yeah, but you think [MN]" -- you think Hollywood and you think of Beverly -- you don't think -- you know, there's little towns.
L:  Yeah, California's a really long state.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean you can --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- go for a mile away from Bahar[?] to, uh, no- -- you know what, north of San Francisco and that's like gotta be a twelve hour drive.
R:  Yeah, I'm like you never think of [LAUGH] it.  I'm like when I think of California I think of the rich people, where they live.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't think it's too far but, um ...  So do you have children?
L:  I have, uh, three stepsons and ...
R:  Okay.  
L:  They're, uh -- two of them are in college and older and, uh, the l- -- uh, youngest one's a soph- -- uh, well, he will be a sophomore in high school.  So ...
R:  Oh, so ...
L:  They're -- they're all independent and they're all real active.  They all place baseball all the time and, uh, and then, uh --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- you know, they're into -- they're health nuts so they're into the gym and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- running and all that.  
R:  Oh, okay.  I have a fourteen month old and a three and a half year old so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, you --
R:  Different ends of the ... [LAUGH] 
L:  You got a -- you got a [LAUGH] few years to go.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I'm way past that stage.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  You know.  
R:  Oh.  Lord.  [LAUGH]  They keep me, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Keep you busy.
R:  Keep me on my toes.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, my, uh, sister in law's, uh, just actually a year older than me and she's got a two and half year old.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I'm like [LAUGH] I [several inaudible words].  Bring him to visit but then take him home.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I can't keep up with him.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [several inaudible words] but guess what, you gotta go home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Gotta go home.  Come pick 'em up.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Mine is like he, uh, fends for himself.  He gets himself up for school and gets --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- his own breakfast. Comes home.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  If he's got [MN] -- if he wants something to wear he -- and I haven't done the laundry he's gotta do it himself.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  Hey, train 'em well.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Need something?  Uh, I don't think your legs are broken.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH]  I think he can get there.
L:  Yeah.  His -- his biggest need from us now is a ride somewhere.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Okay, there you go.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If that's the worst then, you know ...
L:  We've been -- we've been delegated to taxi drivers.
R:  Yeah, of course.  You got -- you got several hats, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  As he sits in the back seat.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, uh ...  Well, that's cool.  That's nice.  Yeah.  I don't think we're gonna have any other kids.  I don't think I have the patience.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Oh, two -- twosome especially when they're so -- when, you know, there's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fairly close --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- together.  They're both probably still in diapers and ...
R:  Oh, well, the --
L:  I mean, that's -- that's a lot of work.  
R:  Well, the -- my three year old, um, has been potty trained since, like, before Christmas.
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  Way before.  But, you know, we tried doing it, you know, before the baby was born last year but it was just too much and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we figured, you know, well, we -- we [MN], you know -- it was just little [several inaudible words].  She'd do good and then [inaudible] back.  You know, step --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- backwards and then she'd do good and then -- so it would be like, you know it -- it'll just come when it comes and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it did.  [LAUGH]  And now she's no longer in diapers and -- or even, uh, pull ups or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, nighttime diapers.  She's in full little girl underwear.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  But the fourteen month old.  Uh, hopefully they always say the second one's easier.  We'll --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- find out.  [LAUGH]
