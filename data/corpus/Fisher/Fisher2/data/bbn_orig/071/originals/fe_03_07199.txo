L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi, my name's Gloria.  
R:  Hi, Gloria.  I'm Shelley.
L:  Shelley.  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nice to meet you too.  Have you done this before?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  This is my third time actually.
R:  Oh, good.  So you've reached the limit?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Haven't received a check yet so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well.  Maybe now it'll happen.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, um, so are you the type of person that has a lot of friends and acquaintances or just a few close ones?
L:  [MN] Um, I would have to say probably a lot.  Um, I'm a pastor's wife.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah, I would have a lot of people that would be acquaintances.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And at this point in my life probably not a lot of close friends or best friends --  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so to speak, but they're all the same.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Other than other pastor's wives.
R:  Right.  
L:  Uh --
R:  You have close, uh, women friends that you do stuff with?
L:  Um, not right now.  We've only been here a year and a half.
R:  Oh, where are you -- where are you?
L:  Uh, I'm in northern Indiana.  
R:  Oh.  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in, uh, [inaudible], Maryland.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Okay.  So I've, um, right now my best friends live in other places.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Okay.  So you've -- and you've only been there a year so you haven't made friends yet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  Um, so I would say that people that I see, I mean, they're friends.
R:  [COUGH]  Right.  
L:  You know.  
R:  Or they're -- or they're through your husband?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Through your church?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I haven't ...
R:  Okay.
L:  And people that I -- I work part time, and so people that I meet at work are not in the best friend category but certainly friends.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  How 'bout yourself?
R:  Well, I guess I would consider myself someone who had few close friends.  I know a lot of people but I don't hang out with them.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, I might do things socially but then, um, you know, I -- I -- I --I like to be myself a lot.  
L:  Mm.
R:  I have a -- my husband and my daughter and I like to be with them.  Uh, and I do have a few, uh, people when they're in town.  I love to visit with them.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but, yeah, I have a lot of acquaintances but I -- I prefer to have just one or two close friends.  It makes me, um, y- you don't have to worry about a lot of the pleasantries that take up so much time.  [LAUGH]  I guess.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, so yeah.  I -- and I guess through life I've -- I've been through different phases so it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hasn't always been that way.  You know, I used to have friends when I was a kid who would come over and we'd play or [inaudible] or go for bike rides or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know it was the same core kids over and over.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that.
L:  Well, yeah, and I agree.  I think we go through different stages.  Like the people that I consider my best friends, we used to live in the same place.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  But -- but we don't now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, we've got friends that [MN] -- that it's funny because my husband and I like to do a lot of things outdoors but, um, we don't have a lot of similar couples that like to do the same things.  Like we like to go canoeing.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, or we like to go hiking and we're r- really pretty surprised by the people that we thought we'd really get along with, um, don't do it.  They don't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- go out or they don't know how to do it and so we're -- we're kind of shocked by that so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we often go out by ourselves.  But we'd like to make more acquaintances and, you know, get to know more people.  There are some clubs and things to join but that's just not us.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We'd rather just have our friends go with us.  Go with people we know.
L:  Right.  
R:  You know.  Um, do you, um, go out?  Do you have, uh, other -- you said you work?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, you work part time? 
L:  Right.
R:  Full time?
L:  Yeah.  Part -- part time.
R:  Part time?
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  Are you involved in any, uh, community activities there or is it through your church mostly?
L:  Um, [MN] things involving my son.  You know, t ball, soccer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That kind of stuff.  
R:  Right.
L:  Um, is how I meet people in the community.  Um, so I haven't -- and we just moved here in December.  We [MN] moved to a new house so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, so I haven't -- you know, just now with the weather starting to get nicer [LAUGH] are starting --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to get out and, um, you know, make those friends.  So, um ...  So not a whole lot at this point.
R:  Yeah.  It's interesting when you have kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you start becoming friends with the kid's parents.
L:  Right.  
R:  Rather than your own friends.  
L:  Right.  
R:  And the kids who are in your neighborhood and their parents.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And some of them you like and some of them you don't.  
L:  Right.  
R:  But ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But you have to be nice to them and you end up doing stuff with them anyway.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And then, um, you know as the kids go to different schools you -- you get to meet -- or different classes you meet different parents.
L:  Right.
R:  And some of 'em you -- you, you know, some of them we stay in touch with and still do things with but, you know, others are just kind of, you know, passing in the night.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Well and [MN] too, I'm thinking with, um, in the days of being able to talk on the phone so easily and email.  It makes it easier to keep in touch with my long distance friends.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, get on the cellphone on the weekend and, you know, it's just like I was always able to do when she lived across the street.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.
L:  Or across town.  You know.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so that's made it, which has been nice.  It's made it easier since we moved to, you know, to keep in touch with other people and, um, that so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, no, I d- -- I really don't have a best friend here locally.
R:  Uh-huh.  Would you want that?  Have you had that -- had that in the past?
L:  Um, you know, I couldn't just because of my position right now.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I couldn't have a best friend in the church.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I do have several ladies that live, oh, within an hour, that are al- that are also pastors wives.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so they are more -- even though -- it's -- it's different but it's just as good.  I -- I don't have to have a best friend that I see everyday.
R:  Right.
L:  That's why I've got f- I have friends and acquaintances here, um, that I would talk about kids stuff and shopping and, you know, that kind of stuff.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but the heart to heart stuff --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [MN] is different people.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Does that make sense?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  They're, you know, I guess people for -- friends for different purposes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  That's true.  That's true.  
L:  You know, the -- and, in fact, like there was a girl behind me.  She's got two little kids and we may go do some yard saleing[?] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- this summer but we're just at different stages in life and she's probably not gonna be my best friend.
R:  Right.
L:  Mm.
R:  But it's a companion.
L:  Yeah, but -- but we're can still, you know, can still enjoy each other's company and do different things so I -- I guess it's --
R:  And the kids get along?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.  So I guess that's one thing I've learned and -- and it, you know that doesn't bother me.  It's just we've got different friends for different things and it takes off some pressure trying to expect one person to fill all those needs.
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  You know.
R:  There's a, you know, around here outside of Washington D.C.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's kind of a transient community.
L:  Right.  
R:  And I say that full well knowing that I've lived here for over twenty [LAUGH] five years.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, um, it -- you know, I'm not that transient but there are a lot of people who come and go, and I found that when I first moved here if you hung out with people who are in politics or who are in, um in law, chances are you aren't gonna see them, you know, in -- in a few years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if you hung out with people who are locals, um, you become friends.  And I did become friends with a lot of local people and I really enjoy them a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're not around much now.  They've -- they've gone on.  But ...
L:  Yeah.  So does --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- that make you hold back?  
R:  Uh, yeah, I think it does.  I think when people come and go you do hold back.  Um, and you do get to know what it is you -- you like in people and what you don't like in people.
L:  Mhm.  We have lived --
R:  [several inaudible words] that one out.
L:  -- out in -- in Baltimore for a year.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Um --
R:  That's a fun place isn't it?
L:  It -- it wasn't a good time in our life.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but -- but we saw --
R:  Because of Baltimore? 
L:  [MN]
R:  Was it because of Baltimore?
L:  No, it was the employment -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  -- situation at the time.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unfortunately we really didn't get to enjoy the area.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know, at the time.  Um, but -- but we saw that in people.  It [MN] we were, um, in the military and people and so they would -- they knew they were gonna be, they'd only be there two years and, um, and they told you they were putting up a wall.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And didn't get to know people.
R:  Right, because they didn't want to get attached.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's a shame.
L:  We -- we enjoyed the mid west better.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, people -- people stay there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they don't move around that much.  Although I should talk, you know, I was in the mid west and moved here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it, um, but I'm here now.  And, uh, it -- yeah, there's -- there's a woman who, um, is a mother of one of the kids at my daughter's school who tries to get women together.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Other women together, uh, to see a movie once a month.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, and I've been there a couple of times, and I haven't done it regularly, but, you know, I'd really like to do that.  But I -- I'm not sure I get along with some of the other women in there.  It's like, well, what's the point then?  Just to see a movie?  [MN] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd rather go with myself.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Or go with somebody I picked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  So, um, but I mean it's an effort to get people to -- to, uh, connect and I -- I appreciate that.  I think, um, you know, with a lot of newcomers in town they need that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but, I don't know.  It's not my cup of tea.
L:  Yeah.  So do you belong to a church or have that connection with people?
R:  Yeah.  We -- we belong to a Synagogue.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, we do
