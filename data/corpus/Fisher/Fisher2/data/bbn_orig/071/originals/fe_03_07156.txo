L:  Yeah.
R:  -- by itself for a long period like that, you know what I mean?
L:  Because they get lonely.  I mean, it's just like one of your kids. [NOISE] You wouldn't leave one of your kids home by themselves, you know.
R:  Right, right, yeah.  I mean, for a day I maybe would, but not for [inaudible] week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying?

L:  I mean ...
R:  Mhm.  Then when -- when animals tear their stuff up or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [LAUGH] or -- well, cats especially, [MN] you know, digging the carpet or the sofa, the furniture.

R:  But basically, you know, you gotta be -- you know, [several inaudible words] I think they look for attention.
L:  Yeah, that's what it -- that's -- that's what I think it is.
R:  Yeah, like the -- you know, the [several inaudible words] no better, you know. [LAUGH]

L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So what kinda, um, outdoor activities do you like?
R:  Uh, I play a lot of sports.  Uh, [several inaudible words] why tell a lie.  I mean, I used to play a lot of sports.  I mean, I'm trying to get back in shape.  I gained a lot of weight this year 'cause we had a hell of a winter.  So I had a winter bloat.

L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?  Now I don't know what it's gonna take -- it's gonna take -- I -- I guess -- I think your metabolism changes.  I -- I call it winter bloat but I think it has a lot to do with metabolism change.  I cannot lose -- I -- I lost -- I'm down to one ninety now, maybe, one ninety -- but that's only 'cause I'm active here and there, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I can't lose no more weight.  I've been stuck here for -- for the last two months.

R:  -- and this and that.  I don't wanna diet, I don't want [several inaudible words], you know what I mean?  I just -- I just gotta stay heavy.  It just -- I think it's just, uh, healthy to be overweight.
L:  Yeah, a little bit.  You don't wanna be too skinny because then you look like you're sick. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But no, but I mean, but I like to -- [inaudible] skinny but that could be healthy 'cause if you smaller or you know what I mean, if you burn them calories up and, you know, it -- it's less strain on your heart.
