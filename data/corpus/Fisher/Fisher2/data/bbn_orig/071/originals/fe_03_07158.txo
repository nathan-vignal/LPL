R:  Hi.  Um, what -- I did- -- I didn't hear what the topic was.
L:  [NOISE] Uh, it sounds like it's activities.
R:  Uh.  Huh.
L:  [NOISE] What are your favorite activities?  Do you like indoor or outdoor activities?
R:  Um, I don't know, both.  I don't know. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah?
R:  I like basketball and stuff.
L:  [NOISE] Do -- do you like to play or do you go to games?
R:  Both.
L:  [NOISE] Both?  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] How 'bout you?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I -- I watch.  I'm not very tall so I haven't played much. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] But my mother was --
R:  I'm not very tall either.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] My mother was a state basketball champion when she was younger.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [NOISE] She and all her sisters are tall.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah?
L:  [NOISE] So, we used to, um, have family dinners at their old school gym so that they could play basketball after Christmas dinner was over. [LAUGH]
R:  That's cool. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] But yeah, we like basketball.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] What else do you like to do?
R:  Um, [MN] [LIPSMACK] I don't know, [SIGH] I like, uh, different sports, I guess, but, um --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] What other activities?  Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm not really sure. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] What part of the country are you in?
R:  Uh, LA actually.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, oh.  Well, I'm up in Seattle.
R:  Seattle?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  How did you get -- how did you get through to this thing?
L:  [NOISE] Um, actually there was an ad in one of our papers.
R:  Yeah?
L:  [NOISE] You know the weekly papers?  I don't know what you have down there but we have the weekly papers that come out that have, like, you know, all the movies and the concerts and [SIGH] they're free --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on the street.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] And --
R:  I got it through, like, an email.  It was really weird.  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And it sounded cool.  Um, I don't know, what else do I like to do?  Hm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I like to ... I don't know, hang out with friends, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I don't know, the usual.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Uh ...
L:  [NOISE] What do you usually do?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um ...
L:  [NOISE] You like to go to clubs or ...?
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I like --
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  [NOISE] Well, yeah, my friends and I, we usually -- if we go out it's usually to eat, listen to music --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something like that, something relaxing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause we all work quite a bit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And, uh --
R:  Have you done this thing before?
L:  I had one conversation, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Friday -- Thursday night or Friday night. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] So they started me, like, right away because I had just signed up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, Wednesday.
R:  I had my first conversation, like, two weeks ago --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- and then they just keep calling me constantly and it's always a bad time.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  And I don't know how to get rid of this thing 'cause I want to. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  But, I don't know ...
L:  [NOISE] Well, don't you need to do three to get paid, though?
R:  You -- you need to get -- do three, you get paid?  Okay, then I guess --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I should do a third one.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, you should do three. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  No, I -- I work quite a bit so that's probably -- I guess I'd have to say I really like it, though.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I have three jobs and they're all interesting.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I have, uh, you know, for fun, um, I actually work at NBA basketball games, that's one of my jobs.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [NOISE] And --
R:  That's what, at [MN] at, um --
L:  [NOISE] For the sonics[?], yeah.
R:  Sonics?
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, lov- -- that's awesome.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, we keep beating LA whenever they come here. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Well --
L:  [NOISE] I don't know why.
R:  You mean the Clippers?  Well, no one really cares about the Clippers.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, no, we -- those -- we wipe the floor with them. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] But, um ... [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny.  That's a cool --
L:  [NOISE] No, actually --
R:  -- that's a cool job.
L:  [NOISE] Actually, the Lakers, for some reason they have a bad time here in Seattle.
R:  [NOISE] Um, maybe.
L:  [NOISE] But, uh ... it's --
R:  Are you sad about Gary Payden[?] going?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm not, but then if you work there, you know, you kinda know what he's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you kinda know why he's gone. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] He -- he -- he wasn't a good team player, and I think the team is probably closer with him gone.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [NOISE] You know.  I really do.  I miss Patrick Ewing, though.
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] We had him for -- for a while and I guess he didn't like the weather.
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Though we manage to do quite a bit of fun stuff around here despite --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the weather.  A lot of people have boats.  [NOISE] My boss --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has a boat.  Well, one of my bosses.  I work for a forensic psychologist.
R:  Oh, really? [MN]
L:  [NOISE] And, um, I also work in cancer research so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- a lot of variety.
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] Um, [MN] is it hard to do, like, outdoor stuff in -- in Seattle 'cause rainy --
L:  [NOISE] Well --
R:  -- so rainy?
L:  [NOISE] You know, the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the rain is a myth.  We don't usually like to tell people that, but the actual rain is more of a mist most of the time.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [NOISE] And so you don't even think about it, most people don't even carry an umbrella.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] But this year we got -- we got real rain and it kinda made some people angry because they wanted to go skiing.
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] A lot of people -- there's  a lot of -- you know, we're right by --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the mountains.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And, um, there's good skiing not that far away, like, you know, an hour and a half, two hours --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so [NOISE] to not be able to go skiing was hard on a lot of people.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I like to ski myself.  Have you been?
R:  Yeah, I -- I go to, like, um, [MN] there's a place near LA called Big Bear.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  Okay.
R:  And I've been to Mammoth[?] which is, like, the best, I think.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Have you tried snowboarding?
R:  [MN] Um, yeah, I like -- actually I used to ski but then I got, um, bored with it so I tried snowboarding and I prefer that, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, most of the younger people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I work with have gotten more into snowboarding.  They really like that.
R:  Yeah. [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's kinda hard to talk about --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- something for, like, ten minutes, [LAUGH] the same topic.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Ah ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's -- I -- I guess my other thing is I -- I'm really a jazz fan so I like to go --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- over to jazz clubs, that's --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  -- kind of relaxing, is [NOISE] nice.  And then, um, I also work with the Seattle opera and ballet, the Pacific Northwest Ballet, so usually when I go out I -- I go somewhere where I can, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be waited on. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Instead of, you know, working.  And that's hard to do when you -- you kind of work in entertainment areas and then --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- you wanna go entertain.  Enjoy your --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- cupcakes. [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.  My son's leaving with his friend.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Did you get your flour and your bread?  Okay. [NOISE] Yeah, I've got, um, I've got twins who are twenty two years old.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [NOISE] So, it's --
R:  So they're older than me.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Sounds like you like to do a lot of the same things, though. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know, like, [NOISE] the last person I talked to was my age and --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- she went to Berkeley with me, um --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, isn't that crazy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I wonder --
R:  It was weird, like, how that happened, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I wonder if they possibly -- you know, because the last woman I talked to was in Seattle.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] That, uh ... now, let's see, what else I like -- oh, I like to -- I like good conversation.  I like --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- sometimes I like to go to clubs where there's music and, you know, listen to music, but sometimes it's nice to go to places where it's a little quieter.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So you can talk to people.
R:  Yeah, that -- that is nice.
L:  [NOISE] I like -- I like people, I like to, you know ...
R:  [NOISE] I like, like -- like, small parties, like --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- where -- where you know the people and you can just, like, chill and talk with them, I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, play cards or something that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, kind of allows conversation.  Nothing too intense.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] The work I do in forensic psychology, we have to be really impersonal.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] You know, because it's for the court.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And it's one of the reasons that it's nice to get out and do social things, like with the, you know, the sonics and stuff is because then you're encouraged to talk to people, that's what you're there for --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- is to be friendly and make everybody feel welcome, they're having a --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- good time and so it's -- it's nice to have that balance.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I guess this, what we're doing here, is kinda like that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I -- and ironically I -- I used to work on the phone for the Internal Revenue Service so --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah?
L:  -- this is kind of funny, yeah.  I --
R:  Well, people probably didn't like you very much then. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That was -- no, they were already mad before they called so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That was, um ... yeah, that was not my favorite phone thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I used to get to where I'd cringe when the phone rang.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] But ...
R:  That's very funny. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Those -- yeah.  I worked on that one eight hundred line. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Where -- where the people who had a question, only usually it's more of a complaint. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [MN] Well, it -- wait, is this topic, like, hobbies also and stuff like that or ...?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  What -- are you -- are you into computers or ...?
R:  Um, [MN] not -- I wouldn't say that exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] No?  No?
R:  I'm not very good.  I -- I -- I just, like, do the basics, like, you know, that stuff on the computers and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- typing and stuff but, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, me too.  I'm -- I'm not that good.  And, [SIGH] you know, I was kind of -- I was actually a -- a communications major in college and have a degree --
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but that was before the P.C.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] So, it's, like, everything I learned, uh, is so out of date.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And, uh, 'cause I went to college back in nineteen seventy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] So, you know, we -- it's a whole different world as far as --
R:  Where did you go to college?
L:  -- journalism -- University of Oklahoma, actually.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah?
L:  [NOISE] Big football school.
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] I was there when Barry Switzer was the coach.
