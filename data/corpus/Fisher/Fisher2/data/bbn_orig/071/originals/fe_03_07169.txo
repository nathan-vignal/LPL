L:  Hi --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- my name is Mark.
R:  Hi, Mark.  This is Diane.
L:  Hello, Diane.  So what type of person are you?  
R:  What type --
L:  Pers- --
R:  -- of person am I?  Um, [LIPSMACK] a --
L:  I mean the --
R:  -- busy one.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I meant in --
R:  Busy right now.
L:  -- in relationship to today's question.  Are you the type of person with only a few friends or do you have a whole schmeer of 'em?
R:  I have probably a few good friends and I have a whole bunch of acquaintances.  That many people, um, I've, mm, friends for different reasons, but as far as, um, real close friends, [LIPSMACK] um, I guess, I would have to say maybe two, three --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but there's many people in my life.  Um, I find that friends take a lot of time and it's probably time I don't have, to, ah, to nurture the friendships.  Um, I'm also fortunate that my family is my friends.  My husband's my good friend. [MN]
L:  Ah, you have some built in friends.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, I come from a large family and I have quite a few sisters and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- quite a few, three, but they're all my friends, so I have family friends.  I have, ah, [LIPSMACK] some work friends.  Tell me about you.
L:  Oh, like yourself, I come from a -- a large family as well --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I -- I think you're right, a lot of people don't make the distinction between friends and acquaintances.  I think acquaintances are people that -- that are pleasant company and they're great, you know, for going to parties and ...  But I think a friend is somebody that you can ask something of that's a little above and beyond and they don't question it, they'll just do it for you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I -- I think I have more friends than most people do, but I think that's due to the fact that I have a very gregarious personality.
R:  Good.
L:  I -- and, ah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but, I think I have, like, a billion acquaintances, but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I wouldn't put them in the friend category, simply because I haven't ever tested them per se and, like you say, a true friendship does take time to nurture.
R:  And how do you find time for all of your friends?
L:  Well, actually, I find that email is a great way.  Ah, one of the things I do is, every week I send out a little email just what I did during the course of the week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you know how you have a little snippet story that you wanna talk to -- you wanna mention to one of your friends, but, you know, you just didn't get around to ta- -- calling them that day, so each day I write down a little something and then at the end of the week, I mail it out to everybody.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  So my friends feel very in touch with me.
R:  That's a good idea.  And I -- I find that a friend is really measured -- a true friend to me I don't need to be in contact with and -- and that is strange, that the minute we do connect it's like we have never been apart.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I have, ah, I -- I stay in contact -- I have a -- a very good friend actually, but I maybe only talk to her every three months, um, but I know she would always be there for me and it -- it's funny, if we get together for lunch, we don't have to do all the formalities, all this stiffness, it's really where life is at right now. 
L:  Mm.
R:  And I like that.  I think though because, well, I think because her life is busy, my life is busy, everybody's life is just too busy to go out, [LAUGH] um [inaudible] --
L:  I often wonder if -- if life has been too busy all the way along for people and I -- 
R:  Um.
L:  -- I don't think that's the case.  I think that something has actually happened --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to change the way -- how people relate to o- -- each other.
R:  [MN] I think people -- I -- I think you're probably right there too, um, and like I said before too, you have -- I have friends for different purposes, for reasons, ah, I -- I have work friends and at work I would consider them my wor- -- my friends.  I have, um, maybe a friend from a group I'm with -- I have a faith sharing group I meet with, they're my friends.  But I would not call them my best friends, I would not -- yeah, so -- yeah, it's a very --
L:  If you've broken down in the middle of the night on the side of the road, who do you call?  
R:  My husband.
L:  You know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Triple A. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, what if he's in the car with you? [LAUGH] You know.
R:  Who do we call?  Triple A --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- is next.  I --
L:  I try to put myself in -- in a position where my really close friends are the type of people who will bale me out.  Not -- not in a literal sense of the term --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they'll be there for me when I need them.  Doesn't really matter, you know, like you said, how long ago you talked to 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you can call 'em out of the blue, but if you say, "Hey, I'm at such and so, can you do this for me?" you know, they will drop what they'll -- they're doing and do that, not because they feel obligated, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because, you know, they're your friend and they'll do that for you.
R:  Yeah.  So, what do you do with your friends?  How do -- besides keeping in touch with the email, do you get together and do things together --
L:  Oh, well --
R:  -- is it just -- 'cause they say women get together and talk and guys do things.  So, what do you do?
L:  Actually, um, I'm a lunch person.  Ah --
R:  Sounds good. [LAUGH] 
L:  A guy -- a guy will actually make time to sit down with you and eat typically.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially if you pick up the tab. 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you can -- I am -- I have a, like, a little circle of friends I have, I just find email very useful for doing this.
R:  Okay.
L:  I -- if I feel like having lunch on a particular day, what I'll do is I'll send out an email saying, "Hey, I'm going to go to so and so's for lunch, ah, [MN] see you there if you wanna show up" and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I send that out to about two dozen of my friends.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And -- and typically, you know, between three and four of them will show up.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's nice, you get to sit down and it's -- and it's the -- we see each other maybe about four -- every four or six months --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because, you know, different people are busy at different times --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I find that the lunch is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the business lunch, you know, you say, "Oh, we're going for business" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, ah, it's mainly to chat.
R:  Yep, sounds good.  And --
L:  I wish I had some sort of activity where I could, you know, like, a card night or something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but -- and I've tried to arrange those, I just find that other folks, it just doesn't work in to their schedules as easily --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as a lunch does. 
R:  Right.
L:  And how about you, how do you gather up with your friends?
R:  Um, usually, I like the lunch too, I like to do the lunch or out in the evening.  Um, sometimes I shop with my sister, sometimes we just go away on an overnight somewhere, get away from our families and do that.  I -- it's -- it's difficult, but I always like to meet one on one.  I don't like to meet a group of friends.  To me, I'm very much -- I shouldn't say very much, I'm a teacher, so I'm with people all the time, but I'm introverted.  Now, that's a hard profession for a teacher, but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I love my quiet --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I love to talk to somebody one on one and so when we go out for lunch it's always one on one and --
L:  [MN] I --
R:  -- ah, and then I do a lot of phone calling too.  A couple of people, um, one of my closest friends is my sister, like I mentioned before, and so we're always checking in with each other every few days.
L:  I would say that there's about a group of six people that I call on a daily basis.
R:  Oh, my.  Oh --
L:  Yeah, just to chat, just to say, "Hi", even if it's for a few minutes and, you know, they get the emails and everything else, but these are folks that I just -- I feel, like, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I feel -- I feel like talking to them, I wanna -- I wanna hear their voice.
R:  Well, that's nice.  That --
L:  And --
R:  -- sounds dedicated. [MN]
L:  Well, I learnt -- one of the things [NOISE] y- -- I found out with the email, was I learnt that very few people ever respond to emails, so I make it very clear to them up and in front, "Hey, don't let this letter guilt you out, I write this once a week, because I need to or I will explode".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] See --
L:  The whole -- so it's a guilt free letter, you know, and I think a lot of it with really good relationships, is the other person knowing that they don't have to really work hard at it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that the other person won't feel slighted that you haven't called them for a year --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or so.
R:  Right.  So, do you live alone?
L:  Oh, no, um, I --
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] -- I -- I, um, my wife and I have been together now for, I think, sixteen years --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we have no children.  She comes from a very different, um, scenario.  Her family is more distant from each other and not very large --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she's extremely limited -- she -- she's not a person who likes to have a lot of friends or a lot of acquaintances.  She really is more fine tuned and more -- and more introverted, likes more quiet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- likes if -- if it's a social gathering, it has to be a small social gathering. 
R:  Sounds good.
L:  Whereas, you know, I love -- you know, my family get togethers were almost too much for her because our -- a typical family gathering is --
