R:  Hi there, I'm --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- Angie.  
L:  Hi.  I'm Lisa.  
R:  [MN]  So, um, we're supposed to talk about f- friends and whether we have -- have large piles or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- just a few, I guess.  Kind of cute.  I'm -- I'm gonna sit on my porch.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [MN]  My -- my laundry's going all over the place here.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm -- I -- I -- I -- I'd say I'm the kind of person that usually just has a few really good friends but, um, certainly does have a number of acquaintances, but the people I want to -- want to divulge a lot of information to and, you know, kind of mull over what's going on with me I -- I -- I think that's usually about a handful of people.
L:  Right.  Yeah, that's pretty much me too, but see I've moved a lot from New York to Indiana, Mississippi and now I'm in the state of Washington.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I kind of have, like, one friend from [LAUGH] each state.  And I, you know, um, call them every so often so there's just -- I'm not -- once I get into a state I don't find like whole huge load of friends.  There's just usually one friend that I'm close with.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, th- -- it's a big -- it's a big investment.  
L:  Right.
R:  And everytime you go somewhere it's just grueling to have to kind of start from zero.  
L:  Right.  And -- and now that I have a child it -- making a friend with a mom is different now because I -- I kind of look for a mom that's sort of like me as a mom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so that's not always as easy as it [LAUGH] is when I was just a regular person who --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- liked whatever shows or ... [LAUGH]  So I'm a little picky because I don't want my child hanging out with their child that is, you know, rotten or snobby or ...
R:  Certainly.  I -- I -- I think probably that's one of the harder groups to be with -- in, is a mom with a small child.  
L:  Right.  
R:  Plus y- y- y- y- your time is taken.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  Just -- just not an option go wandering off and join a bunch of groups to meet people.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I -- I folk dance.  I -- I country dance and I can recommend that as a really healthy way to -- to meet folks.  Um, and a -- a really great way to meet -- meet, uh, [MN] I hesitate to say quality people but -- but really, yeah, you know, kind of people that are interested in community and -- and, um, neighborliness and so forth, and that was [MN] kind of my -- my key way myself to meet a lot of acquaintance type people and then just kind of pick and choose from there.  You know, who I want to become better friends with.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, [MN] that takes [several inaudible words] um, that takes time.  That --
L:  Right.
R:  -- really takes time.  And, you know, [MN] it's -- well, I -- I -- I -- I go to a quaker meeting and -- and, look, when I first started attending I was in a different state and, um, I figured, well, you know, from my past -- past experiences it's probably going to take me a full year to really feel comfortable here and feel like I've got friends.  
L:  Yes.
R:  And I was right.  It took a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- full years.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [MN]  And -- and I d- decided [inaudible] not feel bad about that or whatever but simultaneously one of the people that -- that really kind of took me in and, um, was close to my age group, you know, and seemed to have some of the most in common with me for the hundred odd people there.  Um, she freely admitted that there's a certain point where your life is full and you really don't have [MN] the resources, the time, the energy to pursue more friendships.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like you did in -- in high school or whatever.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it was easier then and, um ...
R:  Well, y- yeah 'cause you know every four months everything switched.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you -- you had a couple of core classes but, you know, e- everything else shuffled around and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] people left every year and came every here and ...
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.  
R:  It's a lot -- lot easier when everybody is in -- in that -- in that role.  I -- I -- I've got a -- a new acquaintance from a party who is a woman married to a former Jesuit priest and they go to, um, a -- a chapel on a university campus that's a Jesuit school and it's like the Jesuit meet and greet chapel.  [LAUGH]  'Cause whenever any of the travelling Jesuits, it's like being in the marines.  Whene- whenever they go through town they all go to the same chapel here.
L:  Oh.
R:  So if -- if -- if you want to go see your -- your old buddies from, you know, when you were all brothers or seminarians, you know, across the country or something, well, they might just breeze through town there.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]  Kind of Jesuit social club.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  Well, you know, that's kind of a luxury.  But that's -- that's a really rare thing.  Neat.  Rare though.
L:  Yes.  
R:  And, you know, it's a big price to pay [LAUGH] to have to go become a Jesuit priest.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess so.  Oh, my goodness.  
R:  But, you know, they -- they -- they're wonderful people.  You know.
L:  Right.  
R:  So it -- it -- that would be a really neat -- neat, um, community to be part of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that way.
L:  Yeah, I, uh -- as far as, um, friendships go, as soon as I've -- I haven't -- I just moved here so I haven't found a church I quite like yet but --
R:  Mm.  You know, that def- --
L:  -- when I do I usually do meet a few people in the church although I don't, like, call them or, you know, I just kinda hang out with them on Sundays, or, um, days that we volunteer, or if I don't know what they -- this survey about friends, if they mean just like close friends or friends?
R:  Mm.  I -- I think the whole spectrum.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, there's -- there's people that you might regularly see and smile at and say hi to but, um, it -- it would take your car breaking down to really have a much more meaningful [LAUGH] interaction.
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that -- that kinda happened to me just last week.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  
R:  Somebody from, well, I don't know what's wrong with the car.  I -- I -- I figure I better not take it into today 'cause Monday's so busy.  Um, but [MN] I'm having like an intermittent short or something.  Anyway, um, I'm -- I was coming back from an event Friday evening and I started sliding through a little neighborhood, kinda take a short cut.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And there's a free sign out and [LAUGH] I saw something that I thought would be useful so I slowed down and parked to pick it up and, you know, picked it up off the side of the road and put it in my car --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and tried to start the car again.  And it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- wouldn't turn over.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, you know, it's falling dark and --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- I'm about [SIGH] five miles from where I want to be.  And it's not like there aren't any buses but -- [MN] this is so uncomfortable.  So I -- I thought well, um, a friend of mine lives, like, a mile away.  Like a dozen and a half blocks away and a guy from this quaker meeting lives right next door to her and if I could just walk over there probably one of the two of them will be home now, or will be home shortly.  So I start hoofing it over there --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and, you know, simultaneously there's people watering their lawns and, um, having their puppies out in the yard to pet and I certainly could have just stop there and said, "Hey, can I use your phone?"  Um, but, you know, I walked there and this guy and his wife are coming into their house just as I'm walking up.  Perfect timing.  So --
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  -- u- use the phone and then he says, "Well, why don't you -- why don't I take you back over to your car and we'll see if it'll start for you".  Well, it went it, um, but then it -- it's just n- no bother to him to give me a ride back and we, you know, chitty chat some about m- meeting stuff basically.  Um, [MN] o- on the way back to my car and [inaudible], then on Sunday I come over to him and say, "Oh, I -- I think it must be a short 'cause it's [MN] you know it started right back up the next day".  So ...
L:  Huh.
R:  You know, so it's a funny thing to start a better friendship on.  
L:  Right.  
R:  You know.  
L:  Right.  
R:  It -- it -- it's kind of how it works, from what I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's -- it's a good way to make friends though is -- is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- asking -- either ask 'em for a favor or ask 'em a question.
L:  Right.  To see how willing they are to help you out.  
R:  Well, [MN] um, or r- real often if it's something that, you know, either interests them 'cause you're asking them about their speciality or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, [MN] or like -- what I learned in my undergraduate, when I didn't have a car, was if I just had the gumption to find a ride somewhere I could always find a ride back, and it was usually a very good way to actually make friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause you have that time in the car to chit chat
