L:  Hi, my name is Amanda.
R:  Hi, I'm Vanessa.
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Hi. 
L:  Well, it sounds like kind of a complex topic.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  Good God, this is the hardest --
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm not sure I know too much about it but ...
R:  No.  Besides, you know, lately the Martha Stewart thing being --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the news.  Um ...
L:  And I -- I think it's affected the economy because it seems like since that happened, but also I think nine eleven did a lot too to the economy.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Things like the stocks have gone down.  I know our stocks at my husband's work has gone down quite a bit so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I can see that it's a -- a lot of things probably have affected it.  They were major corporations.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] -- 
R:  And I guess, you know, they -- it sounds like they pretty much been doctoring their books.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The whole time, I mean, you know, saying that they were doing a lot better than they really were.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  And n- --
R:  And now it's all -- seems to all be coming out at the same time.  Every month a lot of these companies are getting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- busted and --
L:  It does.  It's kinda strange that it's all coming out at the same time.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Stuff like that but ...
R:  Well, it's kind of funny for Martha to deny it because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it only makes sense.  If you have a friend, a really good friend, that owns a company you have stock in it, of --
L:  [NOISE]
R: --  course he's gonna tell you.  Look, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- the -- we're about to sell, or whatever, and -- and the prices are gonna go way down so, you know, it would be a good idea -- 
L:  Yeah.
R: -- for you --
L:  Exactly.  
R:  -- to get out.  I mean, of course --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they would do that.  Um ...
L:  Right.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  And so -- I -- I mean it would be very tempting, even if she was trying to be law abiding it'd be so tempting to not to do it anyway.  
R:  And the dumbest thing is they say she only saved about forty five thousand dollars by selling that stock --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  -- early.  And -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now it's cost [MN] -- it has cost her millions.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  In -- just in bad publicity and her -- now her stock prices are way down and ...
L:  Yeah, I think, uh, [MN] if someone had said, um, that she stepped on a lot of peoples to get to the top --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it seems like [MN] like a lot of the people, and especially in the press and stuff, are really starting to come after ...  Maybe she stepped on a lot of them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, probably.  I -- I guess she's just not very well liked anyway.  So ...
L:  No, I -- I -- I can kind of see it.  She's not -- she's kind of a stiff person.  She doesn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really have a lot [LAUGH] a -- a lot of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- personality.  But ...  Has the stock market going down affected you and your family at all or ...?
R:  Um, not really.  Um, it's just me, basically and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]  You know, I've watched my stock and for some reason there -- one of the things that I'm invested in has done really well despite --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- all of this.  I mean, I really haven't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lost that much money in my 401K so ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ours just keeps -- seems to keep going up and down.  My husband really can't choose which he's going to invest in.  He's got a few -- a handful of them that he can choose but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like the company stock and so forth it -- they pretty much dictate how much he can and which ones he can invest in for now.  
R:  Mm.
L:  That they'll match anyway for the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 401K plan.  So ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Huh.
L:  But it's -- it's not been too bad but ...
R:  Yeah, I guess I can't really say that it has affected me that much but ... [SIGH]  What --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was the other question was -- what can the government do to ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  To prevent this kind of thing from happening?  I don't know, you know.  I mean, it --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  The people that have these huge companies making gazillions of dollars [MN] can afford all of these high priced lawyers and accountants and all that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you can kind of find little loopholes and ways of --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- fixing your books, you know.  So, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not sure what the government can do.  
L:  Yeah, it seems like it -- I wouldn't even think of the government being able to step in.  I mean, I would just feel like one of those things that they have a lot of money and a lot of power.  It's just a matter of getting caught.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I guess, you know, maybe once companies start making a certain amount of money maybe they should be audited every year or something.
L:  Yeah.  That'd be --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- a good idea.  
R:  I don't know.  Just to -- you know, check it out and follow 'em and see.  
L:  Maybe they could, I don't know, maybe offer more incentives for the whistle blowers.  I don't know.
R:  Mm.
L:  I know one of them came from the town where I live in and it's kind a like, I don't know what her life is like now but she gets a lot of credit for being a whistle blower but I know that a lot of times after that happens they don't seem to find jobs very easy and ...
R:  Well, yeah.  I guess --
L:  Life is kind a rough for [LAUGH] 'em.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  People are think -- you know, who's gonna want to hire them if they're gonna -- 
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- possibly turn on you?  And, you know, in their eyes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess it would be a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- betrayal.
L:  Or be looking for something.  Yeah.
R:  Well, it -- it was awful that whole Enron things have [MN] well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, some people were foolish and invested all of their money into tha- that company stock and nothing else.  You should --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- never do that in --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- in the first place.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  But [MN] you know, but still the fact that all these executives knew this was gonna happen and hurried up and sold all their stock, didn't say a word to anyone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then all these people had their retirements just wiped out.  I mean, that was just really crappy.  Those people really should pay.
L:  Yeah, that's really sad.  I think about if that was my -- my dad or my grandfather I'd just be -- it'd be so frustrating 'cause there's nothing you could really do.
R:  Yeah, and it's like, you know, what a position to be in.  You know, when you're a certain age or getting close to retirement, you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thinking you're okay and then it -- it's just wiped out.  In a day.  
L:  I think that they should somehow try to find a way to get the money from the people [MN] uh, a lot of the news reporters say that they're still gonna be rich even after everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think their money should be taken away.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  But I -- I don't know how they could, you know, do that, uh, but, uh, I suppose there'd be more different laws and so forth but ...
R:  Well, I guess -- it was against the law, I guess, if they sold the stock knowing what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was gonna happen.  I don't know.  I mean, maybe it isn't because they actually worked for the company and it wasn't like they were telling friends, like in the Martha Stewart case, but ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I don't know.  I mean, there just seems -- seems like there ought to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some kind of stiff penalties for people who do that kind of thing.
L:  Right.  [MN]  They should -- I mean, I -- c- certainly don't think they should end up having money.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  
L:  When everybody else -- I think they should end up getting -- being poor too but ... [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It doesn't seem like that's [MN] [LAUGH] feasible. 
R:  Yeah.  I don't know what else can be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- done really.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  [MN]  The government maybe just has to keep a closer eye on these companies that are making huge amounts of money and ...
L:  Right.
R:  Well ...
L:  Yes.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot more corporations than that.  I mean, it seems like it just took one person to say something or -- or a couple of people to say something about those that have just been found out.  I imagine it's gonna be the beginning of a lot, and I suppose a lot of the [NOISE] stockholders feel that way and don't really trust the market anymore and maybe that's why a lot of 'em are pulling back and not investing money and so forth.  Maybe they ...
R:  Yeah, I suppose people are --
L:  They don't trust [LAUGH] the --
R:  -- scared now.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It seems to be doing a little better lately though.
L:  Yeah.  What I was thinking too is since they go up and down quite a bit.  Least, uh, the Dow, seems like it hasn't been too bad [LAUGH] lately.  
R:  Yeah, like it was just yesterday they said it -- it was over nine thousand and that was the first time it had been that way since about August of last year.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Something like that, so ...  Last time I looked today it was still a little bit over nine thousand.  So that's pretty good.
L:  Well, that's good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [MN] 
R:  I don't know -- besides, you know, Enron and Martha Stewart, I -- I don't know, uh, any of the other ones --
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure of a lot --
R:  -- that are going on.
L:  -- of the names of the companies, but I know there's been quite a few.  
R:  I suppose one -- one of these companies gets caught doctoring their books I guess they -- it kind of open -- opens people's eyes and they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- start going in and looking at others.  And I'm sure anytime you look close enough you're gonna find something rotten.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I think a lot of the big corporations -- it's so much money coming in it'd be so hard to -- it'd be so easy to steal it and so hard to detect it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably why it's taken so long for -- for peo- -- for everything's have been found out.  About certain companies and ...  It doesn't seem like it took very long for Martha Stewart to get caught but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  She doesn't -- seems like she's made her rise to fame and then all of a sudden she's caught again.  [LAUGH]  It's -- I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I know she's been around for about ten years on TV and stuff and pro- -- a lot longer in her company but ...  I didn't know.  I watched that movie that they had about her.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Just a little bit of it, but they didn't depict her out to be a really bad person but not a really nice person either so ...
R:  Yeah, she's -- she's definitely all about the money, I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Um, from what I've read about her and stuff.  But, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I just kind of feel sorry for K Mart because they're already hurting and ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And --
L:  True.
R:  -- now they're associated with her and ...
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  All the -- and -- and actually -- her stuff was -- was actually making them a lot of money.
L:  Right.
R:  'Til all this happened.  
L:  I actually really liked K Mart.  That was actually a store that I couldn't believe when they were saying they were going out of business.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe in the bigger cities I suppose it's not the first place a lot of people would go, but we have one just down the road and it's -- it's nice.  They have good prices and everything.
R:  Yeah.  I guess it's kind of
