R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE] Hi.
L:  This is Cathy.
R:  Hi, this is Chris.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Where you calling from?
L:  Maine.
R:  Maine?
L:  Maine.
R:  No, I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  [MN] You couldn't be any further away, huh?
L:  I was gonna say, that's, like, totally one side to the other. [LAUGH]
R:  Really, yeah, it's like wow, yeah, it's totally opposite ends of the country.  I think that's probably they planned it that way, though, 'cause the last guy I talked to, he was from, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, Rhode Island, which is pretty close to you guys, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what do you like to do?
L:  Not much outdoors. [LAUGH]
R:  Not much?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  No?
L:  I'm -- up here we got so many black flies during the spring months that it's like you get eaten alive when you go out.
R:  Oh, like horse flies?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They --
L:  But they're little, they're really little.
R:  Oh, they're little?
L:  Yeah, and they get, like, in your eyes and in your ears and they're really annoying. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I pretty much this time of year, I kinda stay in the house until they disappear.
R:  Yeah, th- --
L:  But, you know, I do computer on the -- insi- -- in the house and I, um, I do a lot of refunding.
R:  Oh, do ya?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, so you're kind of an inside person, huh?
L:  Yeah.  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, I -- well, I work inside, too, but, um, I like -- I do like the outdoors, especially, you know, here there's -- there's quite a bit to do, um --
L:  I'm sure. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, 'cause, like, the beaches are pretty close and then you have the mountains and -- and then the canyons and deserts and [SIGH] so I like to go out, especially like, uh -- in fact, I, uh, just came back from the beach.  I was just at Mal- -- in Malibu here, uh, this morning.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I -- I go surfing out there usually. [LIPSMACK]
L:  So it must be pretty warm out there?
R:  It's -- well, it's round, uh, [SIGH] like, uh, 'bout sixty nine, seventy out there and inland it's usually about ten -- ten to fifteen, twenty degrees cooler.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, uh, where I -- where I actually live is the inland more, uh, uh, so it's -- it's quite a bit warmer.  But there's no bugs here.
L:  [LAUGH] Just hot weather.
R:  Just warm weather, yeah.  Just -- just pretty warm.  I don't know if it's -- if it's the, uh, dryness or the -- or the, you know, the smog maybe, probably kills 'em.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's probably, uh, one reason there isn't any -- any bugs here.  I'm not sure.
L:  Now, do you guys get humidity or does it stay dry?
R:  Uh, it does get humid, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  It gets pretty humid.  Um, but, uh, it doesn't usually get real warm, only like probably, um, you know, like the la- -- like, later part of July and August.
L:  Right.
R:  But it doesn't really get, um, real- really bad, not like -- I used to live in Florida and that was, uh, constantly just like -- like, uh, hot and humid constantly.
L:  That's what it is up here in the summer.
R:  It's just miserable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like you can't move without sweating to death.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  It's just --
L:  Yeah, we- --
R:  -- it's pretty miserable.
L:  Yeah, we'll have, like, temperatures of, like, eighty five but humidity will be, like, ninety five percent.  It's ungodly some days up here.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, you have that Maine dialect.  That's -- that's cool.  You have that, um, you know, accent.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I just -- I just noticed it just now for some reason.  Yeah.  So, you ever been out -- out to the West Coast?
L:  Yeah, um, in two thousand me and my son drove out to, um, Brentwood, California.
R:  Oh, did ya?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Brentwood. [SIGH] Did ya li- -- how -- did -- oh, that's West, uh -- that's, uh, West LA, near Westwood, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty -- that's kind of an upscale area.  That's where old, uh, um, ma- -- uh, O.J. [MN] had, uh, all his, uh -- all the, you know, his problems out there.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, you guys are encountering a lot of problems with the Laci and all them people, huh?
R:  [SIGH] Laci?
L:  Laci Peterson.
R:  Lady -- uh, Laci Peterson, right, yeah.  That's -- well, that -- I think that was in Sacramento, is it?  Is it ...?
L:  Um, Modesto.
R:  Modesto, okay.  The same place that, uh, that Gary Connick guy was from.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, there's a lot of problems going on out -- out of that place for some reason, huh?
L:  Yeah, I wonder what they're creating out there. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  And Modesto, I think it's, um, [LIPSMACK] trying to think where that is.  That's, um ... oh, it's Northern California, near Sacramento, I think.
L:  Uh.
R:  Yeah.  I don't go up there too much.  Uh, I've been up to San Francisco [SIGH] but, uh, mostly I stay round here, you know, around LA and -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] and, um, San Diego area.
L:  Oh.
R:  Which are -- they're very close, the two cities.  They're only, like, an hour, hour and a half away.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But you'd -- you'd swear it's so -- it's funny because the, uh, um, [LIPSMACK] the difference in the two cities, it's like night and day.  Uh, San Diego's just so nice. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  LA's such -- is such a garbage dump. [SIGH] Well, part -- I shouldn't say that.  Part of LA is.  Part of -- the act- -- actually the city of LA is kinda dumpy.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, it has its nice, of course, you know, the nice parts like West LA and the south area's really nice and -- it's very crowded, though.  I mean, God, it's just unbelievably, and then Malibu's really nice and -- and, of course, you have Beverly Hills there which is kinda like a cemetery, I think.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what it seems like to me anyway.
L:  So, you're right close to the Mexican border then?  'Cause San Diego's like --
R:  Yeah, yeah.  San Rosedro[?], yeah.  That's, uh, Ti- Tijuana, Tijuana.  It's about, uh, yeah, that's just like, uh, 'bout a half an hour from downtown, uh, San Diego and probably, like, two hours from here, from LA.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  I've been -- [SIGH] actually I go -- uh, used to go down there more when, um, I lived in San Diego 'cause it was so close.  In fact, I went to the dentist there because it was so -- so much cheaper.  You could go there for, like, a -- a third, not even -- or even [SIGH] you could -- you -- um, like a four- -- a qu- -- a fourth of what it would cost here for, like, a crown or something.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  It's really, really reasonable, you know.  Like here it's just ungodly, like, six -- six, seven hundred dollars for a crown.
L:  Oh, it's about that up here, too.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, probably.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Probably everywhere in the US it's probably about the same, you know.
L:  Yeah, my mom just had one, I think she paid a thousand for it.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  For one crown?
L:  For one crown.
R:  Good Lord.
L:  That's what I said.  "You're crazy". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's -- boy, that dentist, uh, he must of had to make a payment on his [SIGH] -- you know, on his, uh, timeshare or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.  I said, "You're old, what if you die next year?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  God.  [SIGH] So, uh, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  So, uh, um, where do you, uh -- do you ever go out hiking or anything?
L:  No, not really.
R:  Yeah? [MN]
L:  We -- uh, my boyfriend has a motorcycle.  I go on that sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And my son loves to go tubing in the winter.
R:  Maine is pretty nice, though, isn't it?  I mean, it's pretty nice ...
L:  Yeah, it's qu- --
R:  I've never been there but, I mean, it's -- it's a pretty nice place, I understand.
L:  Yeah, it's pretty quiet.  We're pretty laid back.
R:  Pretty quiet and -- and it's just, uh, you know, kind of a ... kinda like a village type?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, there's like three --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- right now I'm looking out my window, like, and I -- there's houses around me but I'm sure not like where you are. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, I have, like, three acres of land and -- and there's quit- -- you know, the spaces between the houses type thing --
R:  Three acres?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's pretty good.
L:  Yeah, it's like --
R:  That's pretty -- you got, like, a little ranch or something, huh?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, cool.  You got animals and stuff?
L:  Yeah, I got cats.
R:  Oh, cats.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cats, huh?  I'm allergic to cats. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I got four of 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  Yeah. [SIGH] And, uh, do you ever, like, go out on the water?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Fishing?
L:  Yeah.  And just going up and down the river and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I guess that's -- it's the best place to get lobster, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maine lobster, I've heard that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'bout the best.
L:  Yeah, that's what they say.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I know in Florida they weren't -- they weren't that good.  They were [SIGH] -- they weren't the same thing.  I guess the Florida lobster and the Maine lobsters are -- are -- you know, way up there, New England, is like it's -- it's a whole -- it's a different kind of lobster.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess the water has a great deal to do with it 'cause the water's so much colder up there.
L:  Right.
R:  It keeps them -- the -- the meat and everything, uh, the inside, uh, um, you know, more -- it -- it preserves it more or something, I don't -- I don't -- I don't know.  But [SIGH] -- but, uh, if you get a Florida lobster, it -- it's not that good, it's kind of -- it's kind of tough.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And -- and it doesn't have much flavor, yeah.
L:  Oh, not up here.  It's so tender, it's unreal.
R:  It's pretty lame, yeah.  No, yeah, I know, I've heard that, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] And, um, [LIPSMACK] but, uh, so what time is it over there, like around nine?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's twenty of nine.
R:  Oh, is it?  It's, like, five thirty here.  Yeah.  Got a three hour difference. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, you have daylight still and we're almost dark. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it stays now, uh, it'll stay daylight out till around, uh, eight thirty.
L:  Yeah.  We get -- like, right now I can still see out, but, like, in five minutes it'll be so black out there it'll be unreal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It, like, hits, boom, then, okay, it's dark out. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you live near the coast or do you live inland more?
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm about, mm, an hour away from the coast. [NOISE]
R:  An hour away?
L:  Yeah.
R:  An hour?
L:  Yeah, from eith- -- any direction.
R:  From Maine?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  So, you're -- you're, like, really inland then, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.  Is it pretty rocky there?  Is the coast pretty rocky or is it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kinda sandy?
L:  Yeah.  Pretty rocky.
R:  It's pretty --
