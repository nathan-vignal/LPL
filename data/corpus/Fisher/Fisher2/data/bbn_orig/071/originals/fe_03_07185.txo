L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Dawn.
L:  Hi.  What was your name?
R:  Dawn.
L:  Zoen?
R:  Dawn.  
L:  Oh, Dawn.  [LAUGH]  Sorry.  Uh, you're just a bit faded.  It's Debbie, that you're talking to.  
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine, how are [LAUGH] you today?
R:  I'm very good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where are you calling from or being --
R:  New Jersey.
L:  -- called from?  New Jersey?
R:  New Jersey.  
L:  I'm in, uh, British Columbia, Canada.  So all the way in the west.
R:  Oh, very cool.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah. 
R:  Very cool.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the topic is friends or acquaintances.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Do you want to go ahead?
R:  Well, okay.  I'm single so I guess -- I don't know if you are.  Are --
L:  Um, I'm --
R:  -- you single?
L:  -- married and I have twelve children which is unusual, which means I have people around me all the [LAUGH] time.  
R:  For support?  Oh, wow.  Very different and, yes, for different reasons.  Oh, gosh.  Twelve ch- twelve children.  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  Today I mind having a [LAUGH] lot of them home.  But, um, normally they play with each other and they're each other's friends so it's not always noisy but some days they pick to be noisy so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  I hope I can get [LAUGH] through the [LAUGH] call.  
R:  Yes.  Wow.  Well, I am single professional and, um, have quite a network of friends.  I have a lot of good friends.  People I can count on.  Kind of a [MN] tribal like singles.  If you're moving and [inaudible] people will be there for you for support, um, which is really, really cool.  And then, obviously, um, I have a lot of peripheral, you know, people that I know.  A lot of, I guess they call them acquaintances.  Um, and, uh, my -- my whole life is like filled with people because I guess the way that I've chosen to stay single as opposed to being married with kids.
L:  Say that again.  That -- you have a lot of friends because why?
R:  Because I'm single.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, just to make the conversation go the ten minutes w- would you have met most of these people, let's say, at college or university?  Or ...?
R:  No, actually, um, I graduated from Morton.  I've an M.- M.B.A. [MN] M.B.A.  A masters.  Um, I have friends from college and they were like lifelong friends.  Um, and then when I was engaged, you know, I would always talk to them but after our -- our engagement broke up, um, I actually joined a singles, I don't want to say network.  But I became affiliated with a lot of events, wine tastings, travel, trips, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- beach houses.  Uh, and met a lot of people through that network.  
L:  And did you actually travel too?  Like you did travel?
R:  Uh, travel local.  Local tr- trips, yeah.  Like, not -- not a, um -- I was actually supposed to go to, uh, Prague with a friend and, uh, this summer and so, yes, the opportunity is always there too.  In a lot of cases because I'm working I can't attend but it's always nice to be asked.
L:  It's always sorry, what?
R:  It's always nice to be asked.  
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
R:  So there's [MN] an opportunity to do an awful lot.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And how 'bout you?
L:  Um, well, I married at twenty three and I would say most of my university friends, uh, I lost touch with once I married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, maybe just because we spread out so far.  Maybe different values.  I'm not sure.  Um, 'specially, you know, as I had a family some of my friends were not yet married or some were -- one -- my best ro- like my friend and roommate she was kind of shy of marriage because her parents had broken up.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So instead of having children, when she did actually meet a fellow and marry him, she, uh, I think she was still insecure and so she focussed on raising dogs and training dogs and things.  So just because our values started changing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we separated.  Like ...
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  You know like we're not --
R:  -- you wouldn't have a lot, well, I think there's a level of, uh, practical application that, you know, while those friendships are nice, if you have a lot of responsibility, um, you don't necessarily have a luxury.
L:  No.  So after then I -- I -- I'm having these children and my husband, of course, would be my best friend and, uh, we did live in a place which is off the coast of Alaska, but it's still called Canada.  It's an island and a girl there who's married became one of my best friends.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And even though they mo- we moved into the interior of B.C. and even though she went to New Brunswick, which would be your side, um, the friendship still continued and then they actually moved back to the same town we are in now.  So over that, it would be thirteen years, I think it was thirteen years this lady has been around [LAUGH] me most of the time.
R:  Wow.  
L:  So she would be my best friend.  And she was --
R:  Why do you think -- yeah, you have something in common.  
L:  Yeah.  And she, uh, herself has five children.  
R:  Wow.
L:  So she's had them many years apart.  Like the first few are all five years apart.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So she sort of has older kids and some -- the youngest would be about seven now, I guess.  But because her children are the same age as most of my kids they are best friends too.  And we both home school our kids so because of that we have a lot of interaction so, again, it's values and activities that --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- keep the friendship [LAUGH] fresh, I guess.  
R:  Well, I think, and it -- it sounds a [LAUGH] little pragmatic but region seasons or a lifetime is the way you can categorize some of your relationships.  Not necessarily that they would be bad but that people have different interests at different times and it was just impractical to -- not to have people that h- have very similar interests and they're very helpful and, um, supportive and if they can't relate and you're looking for a babysitter, and you're going out on Friday nights, or you want to get together and -- it's -- it's a different lifestyle.  I have married friends that I've had.  Uh, a couple of girlfriends that got married at twenty one, and I'm thirty six, and I go to all their family functions.  Um, she went from becoming more like a friend where we could relate to everything to, like, family.  Because family, while you don't choose them and you don't always have as much in common --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there was a real bond and a great history and, like, we know each other but it's, you know, fifteen years she's been married and, uh, with two kids, and doesn't work.  And I've been single for fifteen [LAUGH] years and I have a career and I went to school and so our lives are really, really different.  Um ...
L:  But she's become family --
R:  And that was a friendship that --
L:  -- you were saying.
R:  -- I valued and I guess we both worked at it.  So I guess in that respect there was parity, but I have a lot of friends I just lost contact with.  
L:  It's hard because people move and, again, these values change.  And you don't have so much time.
R:  Time schedules change.  One of the things I notice is, um, like when we try to call each other we have more missed calls because either I'm going out or I'm doing something, and our schedules are so different that even making a phone call where it's good for both of us to talk is difficult.
L:  Yeah.  Do you find, um, it's not on the list but they probably could've asked us this.  Since email systems, you know, are fairly new.  Least for me, probably only five years.  Would you say that has improved your friendship with faraway people?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  I have a girlfriend who moved to, uh, Texas.  I was on the phone with her last night.  It just so happened she picked up an instant message off AOL from a friend who was here in New Jersey and, you know, the computer's are all the -- all the D.S.L. and the fast +cable -- cable -- cable modem and, um, [MN] as it turns out she's like "Oh, Brian, says hello".  [LAUGH]  Like this is somebody that's around me and it's like this would be someone that I haven't talked to in, like, fifteen years.  So, yeah, it really keeps the networks tighter.
L:  So you're saying you hadn't talked to her in fifteen years yet you got her on the +email?
R:  I -- I had- I hadn't talked to a friend of a friend of ours in about fifteen years --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- from high school.  [MN]
L:  But you heard through this friend how that friend was [LAUGH] doing?
R:  Yeah.  It's just ironic.  You know.  How are you?  What's new?  So --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- yeah.  Mm?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think it's pretty significant.  The email system, if one can take the time for it, really should be improving, um, [LAUGH] relationships almost.  
R:  I think so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- you know what?  That's a really good question.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they should've asked it.  I'm sure that's a topic of conversation probably for a different discussion but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I know I had, um, an internet discussion on one of my other calls.  But, oh, absolutely.  You can drop a quick note.  Send a quick picture which I'm gonna do today.  I just built a house.  And a friend of mine, um, was like "Hey, you have any pictures?"  Cause, like, she won't be here for another six months or whatever.  And she sent me a picture of her fiance and, like, yeah, you do feel, um, [MN] hyper connection versus, like, I don't know.  People don't have time to write letters.
L:  It does.  And to get the picture [LAUGH] ready?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And stuff.  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  Well, then, you have to go to the post office.  You have to mail.  You have to, um -- I think you lose more contact.  But a email's also fabulous because you can do it late at night.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can do it early in the morning.
L:  Right.
R:  You can do it at your leisure.
L:  Right.  
R:  I know phone calls are definitely more difficult to connect so I -- I do feel as though that that's helped quite a bit.  Um --
L:  And, um, just since you work, I'll ask.  [COUGH]  Do you -- are you friends or able to become friends with who you work with?
R:  I work at home.  And I consult.  So --
L:  And you what?
R:  Um, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- actually have a -- a lonely environment.  [LAUGH]  In terms of my work.
L:  Okay.  It's totally at home?
R:  Um -- home office.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  And I live alone.  So ...
L:  Right.  So you don't see people that way so much.  Are you in a --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- small enough town that you would know the grocery store people?  That kind of thing?  Or are --
R:  Well, um --
L:  -- you in a big city?
R:  No.  The town's pretty -- pretty
