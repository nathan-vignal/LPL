L:  What do you like to do?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, we have a pool.  I like to swim.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's relaxing, and work out in the garden.  At least in the summer.  The winters are really bad here so I don't even go outside at all so there's no [LAUGH] winter activities for me at all.  Not outside anyway. [NOISE]
L:  What about inside?  Do you do anything inside?
R:  Not really.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Well, besides, uh, be- besides clean --
L:  No, I don't do anything inside.
R:  -- and associate, you know, with -- with family.  Well, we play games.  I can't say that.  We play games inside, you know, with the kids, board games.  Those are fun.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, what kind of board games?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, gosh.  We -- I don't know, we have so many.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Word games, you know, Boggle.

R:  Gr- grandkids.
L:  [NOISE] You have grandkids?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  Eight of 'em.  There's -- there's --
L:  You don't sound like you would have eight grandkids.
R:  Well, they're step grandkids.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they're over a lot and we play games inside in -- [MN] in the winter, but --
L:  Snakes and Ladders, Trivial Pursuit, Chess?  What do you -- what kinda -- what's your scene?
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  What's your favorite?
R:  We do Trivial Pursuit, Boggle.  Gosh, I can't even remember all the games we have.  Of course, well, you know, I'm on the phone, I can't [LAUGH] -- I'm under pressure, I can't think.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] It's too much for ya.  Uh, I don't -- can't even remember the last time I played a board game.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Probably been a few years.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Po- --
R:  You don't like 'em or ...?
L:  No, I don't have anything against them, I just, you know, I'm, uh, I'm thirty, just not -- just, you know, my twenties weren't a big, uh, board game time in my life, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, but they're fun, though.  Sometime -- we -- we laugh so hard sometimes we cry.  I mean, they're really -- they -- they're fun, some of 'em. [SIGH] They really are.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.  Oh, yeah, I play poker, that's a sorta indoor game.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like that.
R:  Yeah, that's an indoor game.
L:  Yeah.  Anything that you can sorta combine, well, you know, cigars and -- and beer --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's -- you know, I think that works for me better.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to be like that. [LAUGH] Not cig- -- not the cigars. [SIGH]
L:  Not the cigars?  You're not --
R:  No.
L:  -- a cigar kinda girl?
R:  No, no.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  So --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- what do you do outdoors?
L:  Uh, pretty much everything.  Anything I can do.  I love being outside.  I mean, the weather here is great so I'm always out.
R:  I know.  I miss the weather there.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it's fantastic, it totally is, you know.  Actually right now it's kind of foggy and -- and cloudy, but generally it's always, you know, sunshine and -- and moderate and it's never hot, it's never cold.
R:  I know, I know.  I mi- -- that's the only thing I miss from California is the nice weather. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [SIGH] So, uh --
R:  Do you swim?  Do you --
L:  [MN] I surf, I go mountain biking, um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just, you know, whatever I can do --
R:  Oh, you do do everything then. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] play pick up ball -- yeah, yeah, a little basketball, uh, running.  But that's like, running I do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to force myself to be able to do, like, everything else.
R:  Oh, I know.  That's so hard to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, any exercise to me is, like, so hard to -- once you do it, I mean, you feel good, but it's hard to get yourself to get motivated to do it to begin with, for me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that kinda stuff is always like, you know, afterwards you're very happy that you went and you did everything.  I'm getting ready to go, like, uh, out to dinner and then, uh, hit the gym afterwards, and I would so much rather just go out to dinner and --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- afterwards sack out and do nothing but ...
R:  Right.  I think I like relaxing 'cause, I don't know, we work in the garden, me and my husband, we have a garden, we have a couple of acres and our yard looks really nice and we always plant and just --
L:  What -- what kinda stuff do you have in your garden?  You have any vegetables?
R:  Yeah.  Well, we grow some pep- -- we grow just a few things.  We have out there some peppers and tomato plants, mostly flowers. [SIGH] We have a lot of flow- --
L:  Big garden? [MN] Or is it, like, right next to your house, or you have, like, a go- -- big enough garden that's, like, separate?
R:  Well, we have a couple of acres so eventually a lot of it's gonna be flowers.  I mean, it -- it take -- costs quite a bit to buy 'em so we're just doing it gradually.  But we're gonna have, like, half our land just all flowers and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.  It's beautiful.  It's relaxing.  We have, like, a little pond out in back and we have a swimming pool.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  I -- all I have is an apartment.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Well, California's kinda different.  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I lived in an apartment there, too. [SIGH] So you get --
L:  I have a plant --
R:  -- you don't have a yard.  Once you -- once you buy a house --
L:  No.
R:  -- I think everything changes and your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- priorities and stuff.  Well, ours did anyway.
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I -- I'm sure.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  I'm sure one day that I will become a responsible member of society.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, well, you --
L:  Have a dog and -- and some kids.
R:  -- have fun until then.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I -- I -- I do have a plant that's managed to stay alive now for two weeks --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so I'm pretty excited about that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It seems hopeful.
R:  One plant?  And is it --
L:  One -- one plant.
R:  -- a indoor or outdoor? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- it's sort of like out on the windowsill.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I brought it home from work.  They had 'em like, uh, [SIGH] -- they had 'em as, uh, like, centerpieces for this, like, luncheon.  So, I -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- took one home and thought, you know, hey, you know, let -- let's see, I don't have to pay for it so let's see if, uh, if I can actually keep it alive.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So two weeks is pretty good for me.  I'm very excited.  Looks promising.  Doesn't even look like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- looks like it's still going strong.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we --
L:  I'm --
R:  When we rented, we didn't have -- we didn't do anything either.  We didn't have a garden, we didn't have plants, we didn't have anything. [SIGH] It's completely different, I guess, when you buy a house.  When you're married and buy a house and [SIGH] it's different.
L:  You know, I grew up -- I grew up in Florida and, uh, you know, my folks' house, and, you know, it's like -- sounds kinda similar to you.  They had -- it's about a acre of land and they had a pool and, you know, they were in the garden, like, every weekend and -- and down there --
R:  Oh, you were?
L:  It was my folks, you know.  This is with the house --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I grew up in.  And they, uh, you know, they -- in Florida everything kinda grows, like, out- out of control so I think gardening is more -- more paining[?] than keeping alive.  It's sorta the opposite problem.
R:  Well, it grows year round, right?  I mean, since the weather's nice year round?
L:  Just grows year round.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Grows crazy year round.
R:  See, 'cause ours dies because of the winters.  Ours dies and you have to replant and ... [SIGH] But I really enjoy it.  It's relaxing and it's fun.
L:  What about grapes?
R:  Rewarding.
L:  You ever grown grapes?
R:  No.  Yeah.
L:  My friend has, like, a -- like a sorta patio.  We were thinking about trying to grow some grapes there.  Like, how -- how cool would it be to have, like, you know, grapes and the vines grow up the walls and sorta over.
R:  Yeah, I've seen them.
L:  Over the patio.
R:  That looks pretty. [NOISE]
L:  I don't know if I -- I mean, I -- like I said, I have a very hard time keeping [inaudible] alive, so I don't know what the chances are of, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- growing grapes long enough for the vines to go crazy and -- and --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- reach over the roof.  I don't think that's probably, uh, likely to happen any time soon.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  But that's a good one.  You know, I've done -- this is the third one I've done on this activities thing and, uh, gardening, have not talked about gardening.  That was the first gardening conversation I've had.
R:  I thought you could only do -- I thought you could only do one per subject?
L:  Well, they -- they keep calling me.
R:  Oh, well, that's --
L:  The phone has, like, been ringing off the hook here.  I'm like [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, that's interesting then. I guess [LAUGH] --
L:  This is the sec- --
R:  -- you get to talk about --
L:  Yeah, this is the second call that I've gotten today on -- on -- on the subject.  And, uh, and I did one -- and I did one on Friday, I guess.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they called me yesterday and I just wasn't around.  And it's all been on the same subject so I'm getting a little tired about talking about outdoor indoor activities.  I feel like I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So you -- you've actually -- you've been very good 'cause I got to -- feel like I talked at least about something minorly different as opposed to [inaudible] had to ramble on about surfing the whole time so that was --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- uh --
R:  That's one subject's kinda boring. [LAUGH] I got family one day but I wasn't home and I didn't realize I could call back and do it so next time I'll know that I can -- 'cause I called in.  Usually they call me but I actually called in so ...
L:  And, you know, do -- do you work or, um --
R:  I'm a waitress. [MN]
L:  You're a wait- -- so you -- so you have a busy week, you're inside --
R:  Yeah, I love it though --
L:  -- so that probably makes it easy --
R:  -- it's busy and it's -- I -- that's an activity, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  That's an indoor activity, sure.
R:  Yeah, oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, anything really is an activity, right?
R:  And I love it, too.  That's rewarding to me, people are ha- -- you know, make people happy and talk to people and [SIGH] ... I love it.  [LAUGH] My dad's like, "Are you gonna be a waitress the rest of your life?"  I'm, "Yeah". [LAUGH]
L:  Why not?
R:  Make pretty good money and I ma- -- it makes me happy, makes the customers happy.
L:  You know, I was a -- I was a bartender for a while and I thought that was, like, one of my favorite jobs.
R:  It's fun. [NOISE]
L:  It's fun.  I worked in a sports bar so it was great.  I got to, you know, whenever it wasn't busy I watched, you know, all the games were on, so it was kinda great for a guy, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You're there, it's not sorta like -- it -- it's pretty -- like a relaxed job, you know.  I mean, it gets busy sometimes but, you know, you're in there and you talk to people, you watch a little --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- TV.  [SIGH] Everybody's sorta having a great time, you know.  It's a good place to work.  Other jobs --
R:  I guess it's a job but I guess --
L:  -- people are all stressed out.
R:  -- it's an activity, too, kinda. [LAUGH] I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I say they're all activities, all of 'em.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I'd say so.
L:  [NOISE] Trying to think what other -- if I've done any other interesting activities recently.  I'm gonna try to do rock climbing.  I figure that would --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- kinda be a cool thing to do.
R:  I wouldn't do that if you paid me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh -- yeah, I wouldn't do that for any amount of money in the world.
L:  Well, I --
R:  Well, I'm afraid of heights and ...
L:  Well, that would be a problem.  That would be a problem.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I -- I figure I'm in Southern California, there's a lot of great places to do it and a lot of, like, also, uh, like, indoor places where you can sorta learn.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, you're all, like, strapped up so even if you do sorta fall and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that you don't kill yourself.  But they say that women are -- are really good at rock climbing.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That they're just more intuitive --
