L:  [NOISE]  I [MN] like the weather.
R:  That's a bummer.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  It's fine.  I -- I, ah, it's very simple clothing nowadays.  [NOISE]
R:  But -- but you don't do much outside, huh?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Drive.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's the outdoors.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Half your life here is spent driving.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I do enjoy driving.  I don't do it much up here 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]

L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from Colorado, so ...
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  I like Colorado.
R:  That's -- that's all -- that's a lot of driving.

R:  Yeah.
L:  -- house in up in Hunter, New York.  [NOISE]
R:  In up state New York?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.

R:  [MN]  [NOISE]  I don't know, when I moved to -- to New York -- I -- I'm still looking for a mountain.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I'm from Colorado where ... mountains --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's a different --
R:  -- are mountains.  There are --

R:  -- people -- people told me they were going skiing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here, I'm like, "W- where?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Oh, there's some nice hills in New York.  [SIGH]  Hunter isn't bad it's kind of a challenge, it's not like, ah, [NOISE] [SIGH] Vale or, ah--
R:  I know, but I went to this place--
L:  --Pear Tree.  [NOISE]
R:  -- y- yeah, I -- I guess in a, um, up by Syracuse --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for work I- in the winter and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's -- I -- I drove --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by an exit first ski resort --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- so on my day off, [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I went back to check it out and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I kept looking and looking.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  But I mean I saw this -- this one little hill [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  That's it.
R:  -- it had -- it had people --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, Hunter isn't bad --
R:  -- sliding down it.
L:  [NOISE]  Hunters isn't bad.  [NOISE]  It's a two thousand foot drop.  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah. I haven't seen Hunter yet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but this was up further, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
R:  -- I don't know what this was called.
L:  [NOISE]  At Syracuse there aren't many mountains.  I've been up there.  [NOISE]
R:  But, ah -- ah, and they were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were charging people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as much or more as they charge out in Colorado --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- for a -- for a lift ticket.  I was like, "You got to be kidding!"  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  For that hill!  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I know what you're saying.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Hey, listen.  I'm old enough, I ski free now --
R:  What?
L:  -- [NOISE] but I haven't gone skiing in a while.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I guess you ... m- might appreciate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- those hills then?  [NOISE]  But, ah ...  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I appreciate little hills, big hills --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] it doesn't make any difference.  [NOISE]  I'm a very damn good skier.  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah. I just -- I just really couldn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- justify [LAUGH] paying what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what they wanted for a lift ticket --
L:  Oh, I didn't --
R:  -- for that little hill.
L:  -- [NOISE] well I rarely paid for a ticket [NOISE] so it's easy --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- to walk to the [NOISE] mountain.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  It --
L:  [NOISE] That makes life easier.
R:  Yeah, that's true --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you don't have to pay.  That's nice.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]  No, it was a l- lot of fun.  [MN]  [NOISE]  Oh, well.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, so they give you a lift ticket when -- for free when you're over a certain age?
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Yeah, if you get over seventy your ticket's free.  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  I don't know that.
L:  [NOISE]  Sure.  They used to anyhow.  I don't know if they do today.  [LAUGH]  I haven't tried.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well I wouldn't even know.  I mean I know like a lot of the universities when you're over a certain age will give you free tuition, but I didn't know --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah
R:  -- that ski resorts would do that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  I guess 'cause [LAUGH] -- I guess they can do that 'cause they don't get too many people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- taking 'em up on it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Probably.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Probably.  Are you married?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Have a family?
R:  U- um, no, just the two of us.
L:  [NOISE]  Good.
