L:  Hi, my name is Sarah.
R:  Hi, my name is Rachel.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Oh, good.  Good.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess it's summertime so it's a good time to talk about indoor and outdoor activities.  What kind of outdoor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- activities do you enjoy?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, I like walking and hiking.  And biking.
L:  Well, good for you.  I like walking.  And I've done a little hiking.  And I do jogging.  And I don't do biking, but I do enjoy the outdoor activities more than indoor.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Hm.
L:  What kind of indoor activities do you do?  [COUGH]
R:  Um, I like working out on the electrical trainer.  
L:  Yeah.  Oh, those are neat.  Those are really -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They are a very tough workout.
R:  Yeah.  You get a good workout on it.  
L:  Yeah.  I know I'm -- I'm a runner and, um, you know, I don't -- we don't have an electric- electrical trainer here but, you know, when I travel and stay in a hotel they usually have one and I ought to do that.  And it is much more difficult than running.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It really -- it really does.  I was -- I was just really impressed, so ...  [LAUGH]  How long do you usually work out on the equipment?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I try to go for forty minutes.
L:  Wow, that's good.  That's great.  That is really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- good.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, what part of the country are you from where you can participate in your activities?
R:  Well, I'm in Seattle, Washington, right now.
L:  Oh, are you, really?  It's very pleasant there, I imagine.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's -- except for the rain, probably.  
R:  Yeah, we don't get, um -- I mean, there's a good three or four months where we get hardly any rain.
L:  Right.
R:  Like right now it's been like ninety degrees for the past, like, week and a half.
L:  Is that pretty hot for you all?
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- unbearable.  
L:  Yeah.  With the humidity, I'm sure it is.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  One of the -- where I live, you know, outdoor +activity -- activities are -- we don't -- I live in Forth Worth, Texas, and there's not a whole lot of humidity.  Uh, it -- it gets hot, of course.  It gets real hot but the -- the heat index is not very high so you don't notice --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- it as much as you do, you know, when you're out, like in your area with the humidity.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So where do you go hiking.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Uh, just -- I mean, there are places outside of Seattle, but I just stay inside of Seattle.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, kind of like on trails they have here.  There's the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] Trail.  
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Kind of flat though.
L:  Yeah.  I imagine so. 
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, where I live I -- I actually live, uh, outside of El Paso, Texas, and, um, uh, just we -- oddly enough we have desert and then down by the river, by the Rio Grande river we have, you know, green -- green farm land.
R:  Hm.
L:  Which is a sharp contrast, and then we also have the end of the -- the Franklin Mountains which are part of the, you know, the mountains that go up through Denver and we have Franklin Mountain State Park.  And there are some very strenuous hiking trails up through the [several inaudible words] National Park.  
R:  Wow.
L:  Um.  Uh, my husband and I -- actually we've been here five years and finally in the spring decided okay we're gonna go and we're gonna follow these trails.  And we went -- we actually went a little too late and it almost got dark on [LAUGH] us.  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And we got, you know, of course climbing up, you know, [MN] we didn't notice, you know, the distance or how high we were climbing [LAUGH] until we got almost to the end of the trail.  We looked out and we thought, "Oh, my God, we can't even see [LAUGH] anything".
R:  Huh.
L:  But it was very [MN] --
R:  How long was the dis- -- how long was the distance?
L:  Oh, I -- I'm guessing it was probably about four to file miles.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  In the -- in the mountains.  It was -- it was -- but it was steep and it was, um, a lot of loose gravel so we had to be very careful.
R:  Hm.
L:  So we just, you know, we just kinda went unprepared.  We didn't take any water.  We forgot to take our cell phones.  We left them in the car.  You know, so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if we had trouble [LAUGH] we just didn't even think.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, uh, there are a lot of people that do go.  We have hiking clubs h- here in town.  
R:  Wow.  
L:  We don't have any water, you know, so, you know, I'm sure some of the things that other people in your area there probably like, maybe, go out fishing or water skiing but ...
R:  Right.
L:  You can't do that here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  No.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Hm.  
L:  So what are some of the -- are -- are there any other things that you've tried that maybe you don't like?
R:  I don't like roller blading.  
L:  Oh, I don't either.  I fall too much.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I just can't do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's too hard on my ankles.
L:  Yeah.  You have to have real --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- strong ankles.  Yeah, I -- it was, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- not a good sport for me.  [COUGH].
R:  Huh.
L:  I also enjoy tennis but I -- I just don't do it very often.  You know, for me to say it's a real favorite activ- --
R:  Yeah.  I took, um, a year of tennis in high school.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Uh, I like it a lot but you need to have, like, a partner and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, somebody that you can --
R:  -- a court to go to.
L:  -- with pretty consistently.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  You know.
L:  Well, do you, um, as far as indoor activities, do you do anything like, you know, games on the computer, on the internet or anything like that?
R:  Yeah, I don't like playing computer games at all.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm not --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- into it too much either.
R:  You just sit there.  It's kind of like, I don't know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I consider it a waste of time.
L:  Yeah.  If -- if they're good -- some of them are good in mental things but if you're  a very physically active person, which you sound like you are, I can see where that would not be enjoyable.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Well, what about in the wintertime when it's cold.  What do you -- what do you do?
R:  Uh, well, I do a lot of walking, just like really because I don't have a car.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  So, um, I think in the wintertime I just work out mainly inside.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, just switch it out to the inside?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I try to be outside as much as possible but ...
L:  Do you get very much snow where walking -- it prohibits you from walking or does it just get really cold?
R:  Um, it really doesn't get cold here.  It just rains.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Periodically.  Throughout the day.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So ...
L:  Do -- do you have mountains nearby?
R:  Oh, yeah.  We have --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mount Ranier.  
L:  Yeah. Okay.  Oh, I was trying to remember.
R:  Yeah, we go up there.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever skied?
R:  Um, skied on what?
L:  Skied on snow.
R:  Oh, ski.  No, I haven't.  I've never --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been skiing.
L:  Yeah, I have.  But again it's not one of my favorites.  It's not something that I particularly enjoy.
R:  No.  It's kind of an expensive sport too.
L:  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, you're right.
R:  You know.  You have to go, like, be in tune I think to, like --
L:  Yeah, once--
R:  [several inaudible words] to it.  
L:  Yeah.  True.  Yeah.  I did it when -- when my -- that I first married.  But we haven't done it probably about ten years so ...
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  Then we went up into --
R:  You know.
L:  -- Denver.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry, I interrupted.
R:  I was just about to say, um, I know a lot of people like to snowboard these days.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Instead of skiing --
L:  Th- that's true.
R:  -- like a lot of people my age like to snowboard and stuff[?].  
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That looks, uh, I guess I'm enough older that looks a little too -- too dangerous [LAUGH] to me. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  Something --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- that, um, a lot of people here have probably up until -- up to their forties do.  They have a -- 'cause we have so much sand out in the desert, they have -- they're not really like dune buggies but they're 'specially equipped to handle driving on to the, um, open -- open terrain and they have races out there in the s- in the sand.
R:  Wow.
L:  And we have parks built up into the sand so that, um, you know they -- they kill their time like this out there -- enjoying the time out there and some people lo- -- enjoy it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I [several inaudible words] it's not something that I've done but we have neighbors that do.  
R:  Hm.
L:  Uh, and it's -- it's probably very unique to here, I don't -- I [inaudible] come from Dallas, Texas, I don't ever remember seeing it there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not something we have out here.  
L:  Yeah?  
R:  I'm not sure.
L:  Do you do anything like bowling or ...
R:  Um --
L:  [several inaudible words] enjoy --
R:  -- I like to bowl, but I don't like -- it's not a regular activity for me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not really for me.  At -- at one point in time it was but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I prefer the very physically active right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]  Well, so how old a person are you?  Let me guess.  Seems like twenty?
R:  Um, I'm twenty four right now.
L:  Twenty four.  Okay.
R:  I'll be twenty five in a few months.
L:  Yeah.  I have a -- a stepdaughter that's twenty eight so I was --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- yeah, I was trying -- trying to gauge by the activities if I can guess age.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  I'm -- I'm fifty one so ...
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Sorry.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I [LAUGH] know.  I know, when I was your age it sounded like really old.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I thought what do people that age do?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We do a lot of things.  And then there are indoor activities that I do do, uh, to keep on track with the reason we're talking, is, um, I do a lot of scrapbooking.  Uh, and I sell scrapbooks.  I conduct, uh, scrapbooking classes.
R:  Hm.
L:  Indoor [inaudible].  Um, help people learn how to preserve their photos so that they can pass, you know, their albums and their photos on for generations and kind of tell their -- their life story and some of the special moments in their lives so it's -- it's pretty meaningful. 
R:  Right. 
L:  [MN]
R:  Wow.  
L:  Have you ever --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- heard of anything like that?
R:  Um, not really.
L:  Yeah?  Well, I -- I -- it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  In parts of the country it's really big.  Like my, um, I -- my daughter in law, she lives in midland Texas.  There's -- it's really big there for some reason.  And parts of Dallas that, where I currently live, it's -- it's, um, you know, it's just not -- it's po- it's popular but not the kind of thing where you see, you know, just tons of people doing it and [MN] a lot of talk about
