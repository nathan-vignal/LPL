R:  Hi.  Good evening, my name's Nancy.
L:  Hi.  My name's Rachel.  And I'm from Georgia.
R:  Mm.  And -- and it -- and it sounds like it.  You have a really, uh, southern accent.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, what --
R:  And --
L:  -- part of the country are you from?
R:  Um, actually I'm in Canada and Ontario.
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I --
R:  Way up here in the north.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I didn't realize that [MN] that this study, um, encompassed other areas in the U.S.A.  I never really thought about that.
R:  Mhm.  Well --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we're, uh, we do share a lot of the same interests whether we're, uh, north of the border or south of the border.
L:  Yes, that's for sure.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So tell me about your best friend.  How long have you had he or she as your best friend?
L:  Well, I would have to say that, uh, my best friend is actually my father's girlfriend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, she's a real sweetheart.  Uh, my dad was previously married to someone else and, uh, there was a lot of tension between he and I.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, when he got a new girlfriend I was a little sceptical.  I hadn't talked to him in about two years and, uh, actually she was the one to contact me.  And, uh, I can remember going over there and she was just so sweet to me and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I always thought that oh, maybe there's another motive, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe she doesn't really like me.  Maybe she's just doing it, you know, to impress my dad.
R:  Mhm.  I was just about to say that.  To get on, uh, on his good side.  
L:  And, uh, I had been through a lot of things so I was a little sceptical of people in general.  So, uh, anyway the more I hung around there the more I realized that she was really a genuinely nice person and that she really cared about me, and that, um, she really cared about my dad and, um, she has two children as well and the family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as a whole.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I'm really, really appreciative of her.  And I consider her my best friend now because she really brought our family back together and, uh, there's -- there's no greater feeling than that.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, now that I've gotten older and, uh, we've worked through our differences it's just terrific to have someone like that and, uh, I've never had a lot of female friends.  I guess I was more of a tomboy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in some ways.  Um, so I had a lot of [MN] guy friends and there's some things that -- that it's easier to talk to a girl about and, uh, it was kind of neat to actually have a really close female friend like that as well.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...  So, uh, yeah.  Her name is Robyn and I guess I would consider her my best friend.
R:  Well, I -- that sounds really, really nice because, um, it -- it adds to your dad's relationship and -- and, uh, as well as yours on knowing that he is dating and, um, has such a special woman in -- in his life.  
L:  Yes, I agree.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  In fact I'm actually going to visit them this weekend for Father's Day.  Uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  They live about three hours away now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I can't wait to go see 'em.  Go shopping with Robyn and -- and hang out and just -- just talk about stuff.
R:  Right.  You know what?  I can tell by the sound in your voice, the smile in your voice, uh, she seems just to l- to light you up.  And that is really nice.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's --
R:  My --
L:  That -- that's funny to hear you say that because I have been smiling the whole time.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and I never really thought about who my best friend was until this call.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In all honesty and ...  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But ...
R:  Uh, my best friend.  I've had the same girlfriend since I was, um, about thirteen years old.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, um, I was new and moved into a small town.  And I was thir- or she was thirteen and I was, I don't know, about fourteen and a half and we hit it off really well.  And we went through [MN], uh, grade school together and then during high school I took one turn and she took the other.  And then later on when I married, um, she was still single.  She was working in an office and I started having children and -- and, um, we've still kept in touch. 
L:  Oh, wow.  That's great.
R:  And almost forty, thirty five years later she's still my best friend.  [LAUGH]  And our daughters have shared so many good times and going through school and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, so whenever I had a real bad time, I don't know, she was just there.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when my children, you know, were going through things and mine were older and she -- we [MN] -- we just had that, um, she was more like a big sister than I ever have one.  Either though I have, um, two older sisters.  Um, she was -- she was more like a sister, more like a friend.  We could share anything.  Um, it doesn't matter what I had to say or what we were going through, um, she's always there with that, um, I guess, that rock.  She is, um, where I tend to be, you know, go for something, she'll say, "Now, was that a real +bright -- bright thing to do?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and just sharing things and -- and small things of -- of just being content in each other's company and even though right now I'm not driving and -- and she's not driving, we share long conversations.  [MN]  Um, it'd be just like sitting over, uh, her kitchen table. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  And --
L:  Yeah, I know.  Um, uh, Robyn used to live real close.  When I first met her we lived in the same town and it was n- it was nice to be able to just run down the street.  When you were having a bad day you could just run over there and -- and, uh, just talk about it or just relax or watch a movie and -- and get away.  But, um, since then, um, they've moved to -- to Tennessee moved.  And, uh, like I said, I'm in Georgia so it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a little bit more of a drive, but we do call each other and talk over the internet a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh ...
R:  Uh, can I -- [MN] I hope you don't mind me asking a question?  Um, how old are you?
L:  I am twenty four.  
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  Just a real nice age.  So do you have any children of your own?
L:  Uh, no I do not have any kids.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  So you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you're still young enough to, uh, experience all kinds of things yet in your life.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I look forward to it.  It's --
R:  Mhm.  [MN]
L:  It's pretty interesting right now and, uh, I've tried not to have too many.  I -- I was not ready to start a family or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have children yet.  [MN]  Because I l- I like to be able to pick up and go and -- and -- 
R:  +Yes.
L:  -- hang out with my friends and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I would say that, um, I think one question they asked.  I would say that I'm the type of person that has more, uh, of a close knit group of friends in general rather than, uh, uh, a lot of acquaintances.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Although with the internet, I guess, that's, um, I do have a lot of friends on there.  A lot of acquaintances from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all over the country so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  I guess that -- that's another thing that you have to consider as well.
R:  Mhm.  Because the people you never will meet, um, you share such a unique friendship.  And, um, especially if you're on, you know, [MN] um, a messenger or MSN. There's always somebody.  It doesn't matter, you know, if you wake up earl- -- you know.  Wake up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the night and you just can't sleep or whate- -- you know, if you've got things on your mind there's someone there and I find it the most unique tool.
L:  Yes, that's for sure.  And I've met people from India and Australia and -- and all over the place and it's just amazing that people everywhere have a lot of things in common.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  And -- and we -- you never really think about it.  And people, um, and, um, I actually, um, talk to several men but it's on a [MN] like a friendship basis.  Like there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nothing.  And it's like, um, just interesting hearing, I'm li- listen to a -- a man and he lives in Israel and he --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- sends me all kinds of unique things, you know, across the -- the wa- airwaves and it's like, whoa.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And -- and just a different, um, aspect of, you know, I was growing up in a small town whatever, and you know, don't leave home [LAUGH] much.  And basically led a sheltered life to the life that some of the acquaintances have[?] led.  Um, and it's just really interesting how nice it is when I come to the computer and having a pleasant, "Hello there" or a -- a funny email or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just something that just brings your -- your own [MN] life with a little extra smile and then I'll be chatting upstairs and -- and all of a sudden I'll let out a big, um, altogether laugh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And my husband will come up and he'll go[?], "What is it?"  And then I'll show him.  And he'll say -- and he says, "Well, whoever sent you that you're gonna have to print that out for your folder".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I have a -- a folder where I keep, um, kinda -- kinda nice jokes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I work parttime in the nursing home and sometimes I'll take them in and they'll go -- and the, uh, uh, some of the residents are, uh, it's a retirement home, will look over -- over my book and they'll say, "Okay".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But friends, um, I think if -- if you replaced on value they are more than [MN] money can buy.  Like I always thought, you know, that if you had more money, well, you'd be more happy or anything else.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's the friends that, um, make your life.
L:  That's -- that's definitely true.  I've been realizing that more and more.  That it's the people in the world that -- that are the most significant things and, uh
