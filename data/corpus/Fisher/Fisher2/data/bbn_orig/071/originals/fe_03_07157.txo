R:  Hi, my name is Pam.
L:  Hi, I'm Charlotte.
R:  And, um I guess we're supposed to be talking about, um, indoor or outdoor activities we like to do?
L:  Right and ...
R:  And I like to do, um, winter activities is my big thing.  
L:  Okay.
R:  I do skiing.  Downhill skiing and, um, cross country skiing and stuff like that.
L:  What state are you calling from?
R:  Washington.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Texas.  
R:  Oh, you're in --
L:  I u- --
R:  -- Texas.  
L:  I used to [LAUGH] live in California, in the Napa Valley, but my husband was transferred.
R:  Oh.  What part -- where -- where part of Texas?
L:  San Antonio.
R:  Oh, San Antonio?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I've been in San Antonio before but it's been a long time.  Many, many years.  
L:  It is --
R:  Is it hot there today? 
L:  Oh, it -- not as bad as it has been in the last few years.
R:  Oh.  
L:  But there's definitely you don't want to do a lot of outdoor activities in the summertime here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um.
R:  The last few -- well, I'm talking from Seattle and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the last few days, believe it or not, it's been over ninety.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And it's just -- that's real rare here so ...
L:  Yeah, we have friends in Silverdale.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  
L:  They were transferred to Silverdale when the bases closed in California.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  They went to Bremerton and my husband went to San Antonio.  
R:  Oh. 
L:  So, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we still talk on the phone.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, yeah, I, uh, grew up in Colorado so ...
R:  Oh, boy, you've been all over.  
L:  Yeah.  I have --
R:  So did you do any skiing in Colorado or anything like that or ...?
L:  Once.  
R:  Oh, just once.
L:  Just once.  I really wasn't that good at it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It wasn't my thing though I loved ice skating.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I used to do it at the school a lot.  There was an ice skating rink near our house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So my girlfriend and I used to go everyday after school.
R:  Mm.
L:  And we just -- we had our own ice skates and we'd go ice skating.  
R:  You don't get that much of a chance in Texas, do you?
L:  No.  [LAUGH]  I [inaudible] --
R:  Do they have even an ice skating rink at all, indoor rink, at all?
L:  Yes.  They have one.  It's about fifteen minutes from us.  It's incorporated with the bowling alley.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  
L:  But ...
R:  Because in Seattle we only have one rink but it's a -- it's hours away so it's just --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We just -- it's just that sport is just not really available for this area.
L:  Well, I took my kids ice skating, um, and then they had it over at Seaworld here.  They fixed an ice skating rink one [MN] Christmastime --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Around Christmastime one year about three years ago and the kids weren't that much into it.  In fact, I took 'em when we went to -- back to Colorado in nineteen eighty nine and they didn't like it as much as I do.  I -- I never forgot how.  It's one of those things that once you learn you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how.  But, uh, I don't swim so ...
R:  Mhm.  Well, my husband and I we went ice skating, um, oh, three years ago I remember in, um, at Whistler in British Columbia.  And I got him to skate for a few hours [several inaudible words].  He used to skate all the time 'cause he's from North Dakota.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  And they do a lot of ice -- you know, hockey playing.  Now my brother's a big -- my brother is a semi pro hockey player.  And he plays, um, a lot of tavern teams and stuff in, uh, Washington D.C.  And he skates every single day.  So ...
L:  Wow. 
R:  Yeah.  He belongs to two teams.  And -- but see skating back east is really big and so they have a lot of ice rinks year round.  All over Washington D.C. and Virginia and stuff.  
L:  Now --
R:  But he's been skating for many, many years so ...
L:  Uh, my --
R:  He really loves that sport though.
L:  Yeah, my son plays street hockey and then they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- had it where -- in Napa, California, they have like, um, the parks and recreation had a hockey team.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that it was like street hockey and all he had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was skates.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he loved that.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I used to go to all their games.  I mean, T ball, you know.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Baseball.  Basketball.  Soccer.  
R:  Do they have that --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- in Texas or ...?
L:  They do but the kids were older when we got here so they didn't really participate in it.  Well, my son did go to a basketball camp.  He won a scholarship for that.  
R:  Oh, he did?  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  Through the school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  An elementary school.  It was his last year and, um, he did really well.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So he enjoyed that --  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- one summer but there's just not, uh, really -- I w- I love to walk.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in California I was able to walk more, you know, all year round.  Here, in the summertime, I have to wait.
R:  It just gets too hot and sultry there.  Yeah.
L:  It's terrible.  
R:  The humidity's too high.  I -- I assume the humidity's high in San Antonio.  
L:  Extremely.  I just -- it's good for your skin but it's bad for your hair.
R:  Oh.  
L:  I mean I have --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- natural curly hair.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So my skin's better but my hair frizzes no matter what I put on it.  When it's really humid I -- there's nothing I can do.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  It's just one of those things.  But I miss Napa because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it used to be cooler at night.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  In San Francisco you had to wear a sweater in the summertime. 
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, you do in Seattle too.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yes.  And, uh --
R:  And we don't have the humidity at all that you guys have so ...
L:  Well, that's it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it's, I don't know.  So do you do many, uh, outdoor activities or ...?
R:  Um, well during the summertime I do a lot of hiking and stuff.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Because I have a place in Oregon too besides Wa- uh, Washington and -- and down there I do a lot more hiking than I do here, 'cause it's more wide open spaces down there.  But in Seattle, um, Seattle's known for a lot of activities for summer and winter.  There's a lot of sailing and stuff involved, you know, 'cause there's a lot of waterways and things.
L:  Right.  
R:  And a lot of people water ski and, um ...
L:  Yeah, my husband --
R:  So it's both.  You know, [MN] 'cause skiing is, you know, it's only like forty minutes away to go skiing during the wintertime so it's ...
L:  Yeah.  See, my husband used to water ski.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  When he was much younger.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He really enjoyed it [LAUGH] when he stationed in San Diego.  He was in the navy.  He -- he did a lot of water skiing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, like I said, I don't swim so I never took any of that up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  I used to swim all the time too.  And my husband was in the navy o- out of San Diego also.  So ...
L:  Oh, was he -- what -- what [several inaudible words].
R:  But he was in -- he's -- he's older so he's -- he was in Vietnam so ...
L:  So was my husband. 
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  [MN] He -- he --
R:  So we must be [LAUGH] about the same age then.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Uh, my husband's fifty five.  He just turned fif- --
R:  Yeah, so is mine.  
L:  Okay.
R:  He'll be fifty five.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And he served on the USS America.  
L:  Okay.  Mine was Ulysses[?] --
R:  Uh, um --
L:  -- Benix[?].  He was on a submarine.  
R:  Oh, a submarine.  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause my husband was in the aircraft carrier so ...
L:  Now he was down there in the sixties.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  In San Diego.
R:  Yeah.  So was he.  
L:  Then [several inaudible words] 
R:  I think he got in in sixty six.  
L:  Yeah.  My husband --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, graduated from high school and went in in sixty six.
R:  Yeah.
L:  September --
R:  I think that --
L:  -- of sixty six.
R:  Yeah, that was the same year, I think, my husband graduated in too.  So they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were probably -- they probably served right about the same time boot camp down there then.
L:  They could have and also you think about it.  They could have walked right by each other.
R:  Yeah.  But he -- my husband went on to avionics so then he served a lot of time in, um, up here in, um, Woodby[?] Island for --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, 'cause the A -- A sixes were on the aircraft carrier so he worked on A sixes.  And then he served in Norfork -- off a Norfork, Virginia.  He --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- served, um, a lot of time there too.  But then, you know, he was overseas a lot so he was in the Philippines and Hong Kong and stuff like that.
L:  And so was my husband.  He went to the Philippines and he was in Japan.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, he'd gone Hong Kong.  He did a lot of Westpacs[?]. 
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  
L:  But we weren't married yet.  I didn't know him until he was out of --
R:  No, I didn't know my husband then.  Uh --
L:  Yeah.  He told me if I knew him then I wouldn't have married him.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  I think my husband sort of the says the [MN] same thing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I know.  
R:  I don't think he would a gotten married then.  [LAUGH]  He was --
L:  Probably
R:  -- pretty -- yeah, he was pretty wild.  He didn't want getting married and settled down at that point so ...
L:  See we have been married about -- it'll be thirty three years in September. 
R:  Oh.  Okay.  
L:  So -- 'cause I'm fifty five also.
R:  I haven't -- I haven't been married that -- that long.  I've been married twenty three.  Twenty three --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- years.  So ...  We met each other when we were older so ...  But, um ...
L:  Do you have children?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I have three boys.
R:  I have, um, a daughter in college and, uh, my son is going to be a senior in high school.
L:  Yeah, I have a seventeen year old boy, nineteen year old boy and twenty three --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- year old boy.
R:  And my son, um, talking about winter sports.  My son is a big snowboarder.  And, um, he injured his knee real bad this winter so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] he -- he just got out of, um, the pins [MN] taken out of his knee here just a few weeks ago so it's been all this time from December to, uh, beginning of June.  
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  He's [LAUGH] been under [LAUGH] rehab.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Yeah.  I kept telling him, you know, they kept doing the slips and stuff and all the daredevil things and I told him he was gonna get it.  And they finally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- did.  Finally did get it once.  You know, so I told him, well, now you'll have to really watch it so ...
L:  Yeah.  We have a friend that -- they go up to Tahoe a lot, around Tahoe and, uh, their son's into snowboarding.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he really -- he really enjoys it but she's always afraid of what's gonna happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, he [several inaudible words].
R:  But kids they have no fear at that age.  You know.
L:  Oh no.
R:  They think they're invincible.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  And --
R:  Kept saying, you're not invincible are ya?  You know.
L:  My -- my son would skateboard just to drive me crazy.  'Cause I'd give him his helmet and his kneepads and all of it and then he'd go skateboarding and I'd go down to the -- the school there and there he'd have it off. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  All his helmet was off.  
R:  Oh, and his p- -- his kneepads were off?
L:  And his kneepads off.  Elbow pads and he'd be [MN].  This was
