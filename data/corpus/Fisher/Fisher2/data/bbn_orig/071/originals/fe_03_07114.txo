L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  Hi!  Hi!
R:  Hi!
L:  My name's Alfred.  I'm calling from Philadelphia.
R:  My name's Tammie, I'm calling from Kent in Ohio.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, Tammie, How are you?
R:  Hi, good and --
L:  So, what do you think, ah, corporate -- corporate culture, [SIGH] ah, d- do you think it's doing a lot of, ah, [SIGH] evil things to America?  [NOISE]
R:  Definitely.
L:  [NOISE]  Definitely?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I really do.  I mean, ah, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- A- America --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- c- c- couldn't survive --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- without corporations obviously [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but ... t- there's just such ... I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think every company has its [SIGH] -- has its way of getting around --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- skirting around and you just end up w- with this ... n- negative, you know what I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] negative type of -- um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, eventually it's all going to catch up to each company.  You know what I mean?  They're going to end up --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- e- end up i- in, ah, [SIGH] -- whatever they're trying to do is going to end up in the open at some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- point or another.
L:  Oh, well, you would hope so but, you know, it seems like, -- ah, people have been fighting for, ah, [SIGH] you know, let's say shareholders have been fighting for more up in -- um, you know, ah, reporting procedures, you know, t- the more opening accounting and what not -- [SIGH] for, ah, you know, ever since, ah -- let's say since the nineteen fifties and it still hasn't happened, --
R:  It --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- it -- because --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- big corporations run the country.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  It's because it's their dollars so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they're only going to have happen [SIGH] what they want to have --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  you know what I mean?  Unfortunately, they've got [SIGH] -- it seems like they've got politicians --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the right place.  And --
L:  [NOISE]  Ye --
R:  -- it's sad but I think it's just a fact of life.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah, it's very sad especially, I mean, I -- I was reading, ah, an article recently, you know, we've got democracy where everyone's equal and then we have capitalism where inequality's built into the system.  And then, you know, one part of it is bleeding over into the other part, [SIGH] you know.  So, now that we've got a democracy where supposedly everyone's supposed to be equal but, you know, --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- money is obviously trying to [SIGH] -- you know?
R:  Right, it's still not the case.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There is no equality.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, well, yeah, -- so -- so -- so, ah, -- so what do we start doing now, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I mean we all ha- -- we all have [NOISE] the r- right and the ... I shouldn't say i- it's not equal, we all have the right to be equal [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there's just so many levels of, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, of income [SIGH] and status and there's just so many different levels.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, a lot of it is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- driven off of [SIGH] individuals' --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- desire and their capability.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  You know, I think everybody has the capability [SIGH] it's just whether you've got the energy and you've got the motivation to do it, you know.  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, well, no, I mean --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I -- I mean we have to be honest, not everyone has the capability [NOISE] right?
R:  Well, this is true --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- not everyone is a rocket scientist.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Right and, ah, [SIGH] --
R:  This is true, you know, [NOISE] but [COUGH] [SIGH] you know, a lot of that has to do with the way their raised and the way they're ... you know, the effort that they've been taught to put forth in life.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Oh, I -- I completely agree with that.  I mean, I think that the -- you know, the ideas that everyone should have in [SIGH] -- you know, should have an equal opportunity to -- to -- to -- to go for the big shot, you know, to -- or go for the -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, ah, to -- to h- have the shot at it, you know, but ... it's not necessarily the case that they -- that they're gonna achieve it, you don't have that right, right?  [SIGH]
R:  N- no.  [NOISE]  And while not everybody has the full desire, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you've got people who [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who, you know, as long as they make it by that's -- t- they're happy.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  You know, and t- that's ... just the way every individual is different.  Some people are not happy unless they have it all.  [SIGH]  And then there's some people, like, myself who's in -- I'm middle of the road.
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  You know, I --
L:  Do you mind if I ask what you do, Tammie?
R:  I'm an [NOISE] accountant.  [NOISE]
L:  You're an accountant?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How long have you been an accountant?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [MN] let's see --
L:  If you're an accountant and you're talking of -- this is great!  [SIGH]
R:  It's true it's on- -- I -- I mean, I've worked --
L:  Y- --
L:  -- in a lot of please -- not a lot of places but [SIGH] you know, I've worked in three different companies in my career --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've been an accountant for fifteen years.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, [NOISE] you know, I see the company I just left, t- they're in bankruptcy.
L:  Oh, that -- that's terrible.
R:  No, well you know --
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- every dog has its day, that's all [LAUGH] I'm going to say about that, you know.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  So, were are you working for one of the big five or are you, like, an inhouse corporate accountant or are you ...?
R:  Inhouse corporate, y- yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah ...
L:  Um, so -- so, ah, -- so what do you think, I mean, do you think these [SIGH] p- pressures that, ah -- do you think [NOISE] I don't know, ah, executives are under pressure to cook the books and so on?
R:  [SIGH]  Everybody's looking at the bottom line.
L:  [LAUGH]  Everybody's looking at the bottom line.  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]  Everybody looks at the bottom line [SIGH] and everybody is not h- happy with their bottom line.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's the same with [SIGH] everybody wants more money, everybody wants a more -- you know, a higher salary.  Everybody wants more take home pay.  [SIGH]  Well, that equates in corporate, you know, you want a higher bottom line.
L:  Right.
R:  And no matter how high your bottom line is it's still always spend too much money or [NOISE] you know, "Boy, we really went over the budget" or, you know, [SIGH] so, ah, there is pressure.  I mean n- not so much at the company I'm at now, but the company where I w- worked before we were [SIGH] the largest mattress retailer in the country.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] you're kidding me?
R:  Oh, no, [SIGH] and they're in bankruptcy so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and it was always, every month, "That's all we made?"  Every day --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- "What was our deposit?  How much money did we get?"  [SIGH]  Well, whatever they get [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, they're --
L:  You know, --
R:  -- going to fold --
L:  -- I'm sorry.
R:  -- their doors in a couple of months, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.  Do you mind if I ask what company that was?
R:  Mattress Warehouse.
L:  Mattress Warehouse?
R:  Yeah, you're from --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- where were you from?
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Yeah, we're -- we were, um, [SIGH] more southern.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then out in the mid west.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, [NOISE] ... you know, what --
L:  I'm totally digressing, but the economics of mattress -- so -- you know, retailing seem, [SIGH] ah, seem so strange, it's -- I mean it's seems, you know, it's totally arbitrary the numbers that they're coming up with -- I mean, [SIGH] ah, you -- you have no idea what the mark up costs are because, you know, everyone keeps changing prices --
R:  It --
L:  -- and [NOISE] --
R:  -- it's very subjective.  [SIGH]  It's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a [NOISE] subjective pricing.  [NOISE]  When you walk in the door they assess you [NOISE] to say, "How much can I get this s- sold for?"
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, r- [LAUGH] really?  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, there's no -- there's no set --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not like when you walk into Coffman's and then it says this, "That is two ninety nine".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that's ... it.  There is no negotiating.  There is no [SIGH] --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- when you were -- when you walk into, ah, a sleep [NOISE] retailer that that's all they do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's [NOISE] subjective pricing.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, it's a mi- -- a minimum markup [NOISE] of fifty percent.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You can sell it higher than fifty percent --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's all the more money that you're going to make --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the more mon- -- more commission in your pocket.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, and now I work for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- another dealer, so ... the same --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the same concept there.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  you know, I -- and I -- I just think that's [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everywhere you go it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] everybody's out to make the most that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they can make.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  You know, I mean [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- e- except if you're go into Walmart --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or -- or things like that, but when you walk into [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into most places --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're being assessed, ah, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by your appearance.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  You know, if you're a nice dresser --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, you must -- must have money.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  If you drive a nice car --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you must have money.
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  So, that automatically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ups the price even more.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Right.  [NOISE]  Um, so --
R:  And that all boils back to the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- corporate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the corporate line of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] "How much money can you bring me in?" you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Then, ah, -- ah, so what do you think about, ah, -- well, I mean the, IRS and -- I mean do you think the government needs more regulators and investigators in order to, ah, [SIGH] help ... introduce an environment where, you know, people do -- do -- do -- do abide by the rules and, ah, you know, it is an even -- even playing field?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they definitely need more.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know that [NOISE] it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a capability of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- having e- ever enough.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, because they're so [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] anything --
L:  The connotation the cheat is too big?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  I mean any -- anything you do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people find a way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] to skirt around the back door.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  So, -- and, yeah, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --you could have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] an investigator for every company --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so you block off one way of cheating, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're going to find another way.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  I think it's just human nature.
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And --
L:  [NOISE]  Okay, so you can't catch everybody but do you think, ah, [SIGH] I mean do you think that most companies are -- are -- are, -- ah, cheaters, let's say or do you think they --
R:  In one way or another.
L:  -- that most of 'em --  [LAUGH]
R:  You know that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- honestly, in one way or another, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think they're like Enron, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't think every company is like Enron --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] b- but, y- yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every -- in some way or another --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every company.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  So, ah, let me --
R:  And whether it -- and whether it's, [SIGH] um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] intentional or not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, ignorant -- it could be ignorance --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- but that's no excuse, you know, there is [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every company has one way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or another, a --
L:  [NOISE]  Do you think, ah, more companies -- ah, do you think companies have gotten worse in the last ten years, let's say or, ah, [SIGH] I mean do you think it was always this bad or do you think it's worse now, I guess, [NOISE] is my question?
R:  Mm, [MN] I -- I just think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more visible now.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  It's more visible?  Well, that's a good think it seems, right?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean I just --
L:  I mean if we're working towards, you know, cleaner [SIGH] --
R:  I think it's always been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's [NOISE] just more [SIGH] -- think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because the media is just more out in the open now.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  Where before, you know, the media wasn't the way it is now.  I mean you can't --
L:  [NOISE]  Ah ...
R:  -- even brush your teeth without --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] t- the media knowing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about it, it seems like.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, obviously you're not going to be able to cheat [LAUGH] without them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- them figuring it out.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I don't know, the media -- the media seems, [NOISE] ah, so complacent sometimes, you know?  [SIGH]  A- a- and also breaking the news it's hard, you know, I used -- I used to be a reporter and, [SIGH] ah, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] there was, ah, it was -- it was very hard --
