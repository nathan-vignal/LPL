L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  This is Connie.
L:  Hi, Connie.  This is Jo.  How are you?
R:  Okay.  How are you?
L:  Pretty good.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Ohio.  
L:  Are you in Ohio?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Me too.  Dayton.
R:  Youngstown. 
L:  Youngstown.  Okay.  All right.  
R:  Um.  I guess the topic is corporate --
L:  Scandal and fraud.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And--
R:  Yeah.
L:  Martha Stewart and a whole [LAUGH] shebang.
R:  Uh, the whole shebang.  Enron and everything else.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  It's all -- 
L:  And -- and something about the fed- what the federal government can do?
R:  Yeah.  I don't think they should step into it at all except when it comes down to the federal charges.  And then once the federal charges are filed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really go after the CEOs and the accountants and everyone else at the -- at the, uh, upper administration.  The C, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Get after them.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- something's gotta be done, I know that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because, um, [SIGH] I don't know.  [MN]  You know, I -- I don't know what the answer is and I don't know where you start because obviously people have to have a certain am- amount of accountability and they have to have some integrity and honesty and [MN] y- you know, so [MN] I don't know how the federal government could even instill that in people.  I mean, if you don't have it, you know, as a human being, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what makes the federal government think that they're gonna be able to, you know, to [MN] come in and -- and, you know ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  I know they're --
L:  But, uh ...
R:  -- definitely after Martha Stewart because she was an easy target.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she was a woman and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was one woman versus the whole corporation.  She could [MN] -- she was --
L:  But then -- yeah.  But as far as Enron and all these other companies doing, you know, and these accounting firms and, I mean, you know, this stuff that's going on.  You know, it does affect our economy and -- and the stock market and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, [MN] part of the reason we're probably in the situation that we are now with deficit and stuff is because of that.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people's retirements.  When -- when you think of all these people that worked, you know, at these companies and now they can't retire.
R:  -tire.  Those people that did retire and now they've -- now they have no one out there.
L:  And now they have nothing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I mean, [MN] you know, we're gonna have to work, uh, ten extra years to hopefully recoup and recover, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [MN] i- it [SIGH] it's just -- it's horrible.  It's horrible 
R:  Mhm.  Well, I'm not really sure if the government is the right [SIGH] -- they should have something independent to have to deal with -- just with, um, corporations.
L:  Yeah.
R:  To deal with this.  'Cause the government --
L:  Well --
R:  -- has it's own -- they also have their own problems.  
L:  I just think that [NOISE] they need to make sure that the penalties are stiffer.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that these people do time and [MN] not at the, uh, you know, the, uh, white collar prison.  If there is such a thing.  You know, at the country club prison.  I mean, they really actually need to do -- I mean, [SIGH] you know --
R:  Hard time at the county jail with the -- with the dope dealers and ...
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And whatever else is in there.  The murderers and the, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, [MN] because what they did was wrong.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  But, [NOISE] you know, I -- I just, you know, they've got to make it -- y- -- they've -- they've -- they do have to make it tougher -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the -- on the people.  You know, every -- sure everybody's gonna steal if they think they can get away it.  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they don't have a conscience.
R:  Right.  And these people got away with a little and then they kept on going bigger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and bigger and bigger.  And they just ...
L:  Yeah.  And you know, more people have to be willing to, um, you know, come forward --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- too.  You know.  And [MN] when they ostracize someone for coming forward --
R:  Forward.
L:  -- and -- a- and, you know, then that, you know, you -- you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but, you know.  They've -- they've got to be [MN] more people just come forward.  When --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they know something's wrong, they gotta speak up.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause if they don't then really you're just as bad as the person who's doing the actual, you know, embezzling or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- whatever.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But ...  I don't know.  I think the federal government maybe has their hands in a l- -- in -- in more stuff than they really need to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anyway, in the first place.  You know. 
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  But ...  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I sure don't know what the answer is.  You know.  We'll have to wait and [LIPSMACK], I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  Get -- maybe something with the New York Stock Exchange.  Have them deal with it.  With, uh, as far as the penalty phase is concerned.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And really put these people's needs [several inaudible words].  I have no idea with names as far as who was in Enron and who was in the other -- other [MN], um ...
L:  Yeah.  The -- I can't even think what they are now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, yeah, there has to be some way to govern, you know, to -- nobody has any faith and trust and you don't want to invest your money because, you know, you're afraid.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  That it -- it's, you know, [MN].
R:  And like I have -- I have a 401K and the people talking at work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have the 401Ks [MN] who are my age who should be investing a little bit in the stock market.  We're all going --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- towards is the safe stuff.  
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  'Cause we see it, no, it's not going anywhere --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fast.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  
R:  And the safe stuff's not really that hot either --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but at least you're not gonna run into a deficit.  You're going to get your money back.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're not going to -- make any off of it but ...
L:  Well you hope it's not -- a- at one point, you know, it's gotta start getting better.  You know.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's gotta go back up.  But if people aren't willing to invest, if you can't trust, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- someone, um, you know, then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people are not gonna invest and then that's not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gonna, you know, it's not gonna turn around.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  
R:  And it just all -- [MN] the whole economy's based upon --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people having money to spend.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And --
R:  And --
L:  -- nobody's spending, that's for sure.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, there -- there has to be a belief system, you know, you -- you've got some -- somehow, you've got to, you know, believe --
R:  Get the --
L:  -- and start investing again.
R:  Mhm.  And get these people back. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Get 'em -- get people back to work.
R:  Have some sort of check system.
L:  You know, our unemployment rate is -- is, you know, out of sight.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Have some sort of check system in place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  And I just don't, you know, if not the federal government [NOISE] then who?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  I don't know.  Can you trust Wall Street?  I mean, I wouldn't.  You know.  I wouldn't dare go back and trust, you know, not for a long, long, long time.  
R:  Mhm
L:  You know. 
R:  But ...
L:  And -- and all these [MN] big CEOs making all these bonuses and --
R:  [MN]  Bonuses.  
L:  -- and --
R:  Especially when they go bankrupt.  They get -- the -- the bonuses get even higher.
L:  Well, yeah.  And they're still getting all these benefits and these poor people, you know, are left with nothing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm like, I don't know.
R:  [SIGH]  Perha- -- [MN].
L:  It's frightening.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But now I don't know if you -- I -- you know, I just don't know if I could trust Wall Street or an accounting firm, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  After everything that's happened because it's not just one.  It's not just Enron.  It's -- you know, it's a lot of those.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lot.
R:  Yeah.  And if -- the ones you don't know about that are kind of frightening.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause Enron, we never really heard about them until the -- the scandal broke.
L:  Right.  Until it broke and -- and -- and, you know, here were all these people had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- lost all of their retirement.
R:  [MN]  Uh-huh.
L:  And their savings.  And who -- and really who's gonna pay for that?  You know.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because the poor -- you know, they're gonna draw welfare or [SIGH], you know, work fair[?] or some kind of something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They've gotta be taken care of, so at some point, you know, we -- we end up paying, you know, double.  
R:  Yeah, we do.
L:  You know.  Because we pay 'em for our taxes and then, you know, they're gonna raise 'em and then we're gonna pay again.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I just -- I don't know.
R:  I -- that [MN].  The point --
L:  But --
R:  -- is, who can you trust right now with ...?
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's for sure.
R:  [MN]  Everywhere you look you see something going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even -- [MN]
L:  Yeah.  From the White [LAUGH] -- you know, when you say ...  From the White House all the way down.
R:  All the way down to my [LAUGH] congressman.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I -- yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's ... [SIGH]  I know, it's sad.  
R:  And the local --
L:  But, you know --
R:  -- government and you just don't know who.
L:  Yeah.  And you know [MN] i- i- it gets -- it gets back to, you know, I'm not, you know, I -- I -- I don't believe [MN] you know, that there should necessarily be prayer in school but whenever, you know, people are complaining about ten commandments, why can't it just be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ten good suggestions, you know, on -- on morality and good moral living.  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Don't cheat.  Don't lie.  Don't steal.  Don't, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Y- you know.  Why [LAUGH] can't --
R:  You can have --
L:  [MN]
R:  You [MN] -- just -- just the basics and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if -- if it -- if it happens --
L:  Ha- --
R:  -- you -- you -- there's penalties involved.
L:  With -- yeah, without, you know, [MN] yeah, exactly.  You know, if you do this then this is gonna happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ...
R:  I don't know. 
L:  I don't know.
R:  People getting away with everything and they just don't ...  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  They don't -- they see what they can get away with on something and then it just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- gets bigger and bigger.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Uh, [MN] they want to get rich quick.  [NOISE]  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's like a -- a get rich quick fix and i- it's just, you know, doesn't happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's like the more money that they have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the more that --
R:  That they want.
L:  -- they want.  You know, and -- and they're never satisfied.  And they want more things.  And at some point, you know, you gotta just be satisfied.
R:  Mhm.  And just --
L:  You know.
R:  -- say, I quit.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  This is enough.
L:  You know.
R:  I quit.  
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, like I said, people have
