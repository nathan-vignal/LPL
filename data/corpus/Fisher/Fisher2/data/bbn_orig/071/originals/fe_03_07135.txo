R:  Hi, my name is Krista.
L:  Hi, Krista.  My name is Lesley.  
R:  Hi.  What state are you in?
L:  I'm in, um, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
R:  No way.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Milwaukee.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my gosh.  I'm in act- I'm actually in West Alice.
L:  I'm actually in East Troy.  
R:  Wow.  
L:  That's kind of funny.  
R:  That is really weird, isn't it?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Holy cow.  [MN]
L:  We haven't lived here very long.  Just through -- this is our second summer and our --
R:  M- m- mine too.
L:  -- second fall.  [LAUGH]  Where did --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you move from?
R:  Uh, Michigan.
L:  Oh.  Well, we moved from Colorado.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Well, Michigan has a lot colder weather than [MN] well, certainly Colorado.  Is it colder in Michigan than it is here?
R:  Well, it depends.  I was kind of on the -- I was on the lake edge over there too.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, actually I think our winters were a lot harsher.
L:  There?
R:  Than here.  Yeah.  I guess if I was closer to the water out here it would be.
L:  Did you --
R:  But --
L:  -- grow up doing winter -- winter sports and stuff?
R:  [MN]  Just a little bit.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just when I was a kid.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We did certain things.  Yeah.  How 'bout you?
L:  Well, I grew up in Connecticut and, um, I -- I, you know, I'm just not a play person.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I just, um, I don't put -- my husband says that if the mailbox wasn't outside that I would never go [LAUGH] outside. 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And I think that's an exaggeration but not by far.  
R:  Wow.  No, I'm outside most of the time.  Matter of fact I was on my way headed outside when the phone rang.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah, I've spent the last two weeks outside working in the yard.
L:  Is that what you like to do outside?
R:  Y- yeah.  That is my favorite place to be, is outside.  I -- I love summer.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  What do you -- what do you like about it 'cause I'm a bit -- I mean, the idea of doing stuff outside and -- and -- and enjoying it is kind of foreign to me.
R:  Really?  Oh, I like to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like to garden.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I like to garden and I like the flowers.  The people that we bought the house from, they actually won the West Alice Beautification Award --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for how the yard was set up.
L:  Wow.
R:  And my home I had back in Michigan, that's all I did.  I was mostly flowers out there.  The mail person wouldn't even bring my mail up anymore because of the bees.
L:  No kidding?
R:  Right.  So --
L:  Ha.
R:  -- we're -- we're keeping up with what the previous owners did.  We're outside all the time working in the yard.  Planting and we've, uh, renovated a lot of stuff landscaping.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you --
R:  You don't go outside to plant --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or to play in the yard or ...?
L:  Um, I have -- I have two young kids and, um, so that's been my biggest challenge is -- is going outside with them [NOISE] and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and enjoying it.
R:  I mean, if you fenced in your yard it'll help.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What's that?
R:  Fence in your yard and put some toys out there.
L:  You know, we thought of that.  And I thought that, um, that that would really work better for us.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can you hold on just a second?
R:  Sure.  
L:  [NOISE]  Um, sorry about that.  
R:  That's all right.
L:  So it -- we -- we have a swing set upstairs.  Uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, outside.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, that's been their main source of activity.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  And, uh, so I just go out there and I -- and I sit with them.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  We're putting in a pool this summer.  
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, an above ground pool?
R:  Yeah, above ground.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, it was something we promised, uh, our daughter when we bought the house last summer.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So we're putting a pool in.  So we've completed most of the renovations so now we can put the pool up.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Boy.  And will it be up for the summer's use?
R:  What?
L:  Will it be up for this summer?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Sure will and we'll be outside.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  My daughter's a real swimmer, so that'll be fun.
L:  That sounds like fun.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah and I, um, I -- so I guess I prefer indoor activities but I, you know, I really enjoy watching movies.
R:  Oh.
L:  So that's something I like to do.  And I love to read.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So those are my activities. 
R:  Right.  
L:  And, um ...
R:  My inside activities, uh, circle around the computer.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's what I do.  
L:  That's true for my husband as well.  He likes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to do that.  
R:  Yeah.  If I'm inside I'm on the computer or --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- I'm cooking dinner or I'm in bed.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Those are the three choices.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  I guess my biggest -- biggest fun activity is naptime.  [LAUGH]  I just --
R:  Naptime? [LAUGH] 
L:  -- really love naptime.  [LAUGH]  I am -- you know I've always loved nap times but even --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- now with, um, with -- with the twins, young twins, I just, uh, I really seize that moment to -- that's what I --
R:  How old are they?
L:  -- like to do.  They're almost three. 
R:  Oh, three.  Oh, you're busy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That would be fun.
L:  How old is your daughter?
R:  She's ten and a half.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When she was younger we used to, uh, set up play dates with other parents in the preschool and go down to the local park.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, we had a great big park back in Michigan.  It was huge.  They had just built it.  It cost them two million dollars to build this place.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And it had everything and anything.  You pack a lunch and you stayed there all day.
L:  No kidding?
R:  Yeah.  It was a lot of fun.  And then there was another one, um, in the city of Saginaw[?] there was a water park just for children [COUGH] 'scuse me, eight and under.
L:  Really?
R:  And it was -- and it was free. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That sounds neat. 
R:  Yeah, so they -- they -- they've really promoted exercise and all that other stuff to get out there so ...  To be outside.  Yeah.
L:  We have a small lake in our -- in East Troy.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, my neighbor goes there all the time and she has a -- a -- a three year old --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- also and she just had it -- has a newborn.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, um, I was --
R:  Her hands are full.
L:  -- just amazed that, you know, she spent the last two weekends at the beach with the kids.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, especially with a newborn.  I wouldn't put a --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I wouldn't put a baby in the sun, ever.  
L:  Well, I think --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the baby was covered 'cause there are some trees --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- there and, you know --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- and, um, I think the -- 
R:  But the beach is fun. 
L:  Yeah.  Well ...
R:  We -- we went to, uh, Mexico last year and Texas and did the South Padre Islands.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that was beautiful.  Beautiful down there.  Beautiful weather.  Really windy.  But --
L:  What did you do?
R:  Um, shopped a lot in Mexico.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was the basis of it.  Took three suitcases with us and brought home six.  
L:  No kidding?
R:  We did a lot of shopping.  [inaudible].
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  Walking the streets down there and then, uh, oh, Padre Island was beautiful.  But -- it was just gorgeous.  But --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- this time of the year it's too hot.  My parents are down there right now and it's just too hot.  They're headed back home today.
L:  Are they vacationing?
R:  Uh, they have a home down there also.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  So ...  Yeah.  
L:  Huh.  My friends like to shop.  We've -- I've been to Mexico a couple of times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's their favorite thing to do too.
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] of America is fun to go too.  Have you been out there yet?
L:  No.  Uh-huh.
R:  [several inaudible words].  +Holy child[?].  That's three stories tall and there's over a thousand stores.
L:  Wow.
R:  Shoppers paradise.  It took us two days to go through the whole thing.
L:  I was just gonna ask what -- how long does it take to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they have -- I know that there are fun things to do.  There's an ice skating rink.  
R:  There's -- there's an amusement park inside.  
L:  Really?
R:  Damp -- Damp Snoopy.  Yeah.  It's an amusement park catered to the younger but there is even a roller coaster in there for adults.  
L:  A roller coaster inside a mall.
R:  A roller coaster.  It's huge.  
L:  Now that --
R:  It's huge.
L:  -- brings outdoor fun indoors.  
R:  Yeah.  The -- the Minnesota Zoo isn't, um, uh, we're real zoo people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the Minnesota Zoo is not even worth going to.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  And this -- this Milwaukee Zoo that we have out here -- have you been to that yet?
L:  Not yet.  And I'd really like to go.
R:  Yeah.  That -- it's not bad.  It's kinda small.  And, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- w- we're used to the Detroit Zoo and the Detroit Zoo is huge.  
L:  Is it?
R:  It's just +monstrous and you have to walk so far to get to something but the landscaping is just gorgeous.  
L:  Really?
R:  And -- yeah.  And when you compare it to the Milwaukee Zoo it's like, +oh, I think the Detroit Zoo's about six times larger.  
L:  Huh.
R:  And the [COUGH] the Toledo Zoo is really super small.  It is a tiny, tiny place.  
L:  Huh.
R:  It -- it makes the Milwaukee Zoo look huge.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And the Milwaukee Zoo is small.  Yeah.
L:  We just went back to Colorado for vacation and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, and it was a lot of fun to go to Ocean Journey, the aquarium.  And --
R:  Oh, I've never been there.
L:  Before we moved it was -- it's a -- it's a new building and it -- it -- it's just an, I thought, an incredible aquarium.
R:  Wow.
L:  And we just loved it.  In fact, even knowing that we were going to move out of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- state we still bought a season pass and we used it quite a bit.
R:  Well, your season pass is good in every state for their, uh, for their zoos.  Did you know that?
L:  No.  I didn't know that.  And it's --
R:  Yeah,  you're --
L:  -- long expired.
R:  Oh, it -- it --
L:  Unfortunately, yeah.
R:  When you buy a zoological pass --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they're good for every -- they're good for every zoo in the United States plus quite a few out of the country.
L:  Really?
R:  You -- yeah.  The only difference is when buying the zoological pass whatever zoo you buy it at you get free parking.  So if you bought the Milwaukee's which is seventy dollars you would get free parking which is a five dollar value.
L:  I wondered how much the value of that is 'cause I saw that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we were looking at, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- getting the -- the family pass.
R:  Yeah.  Now see when I lived in Michigan the Detr- Detroit Zoo's, uh, yearly pass was fifty and in Saginaw you can get the children's zoo, which is a small zoo and it was twenty five dollars.  
L:  Huh.
R:  And so we would buy the Saginaw Children's Zoo, the small pass, for twenty five bucks and just pay our, uh, [MN] uh, parking fee when we went to the Detroit Zoo because that got us into every zoo across the nation.  And we vacation a lot.
L:  Wow. 
R:  And so that was always a spot to go.  Was to go to the zoo.  It was cheap.
