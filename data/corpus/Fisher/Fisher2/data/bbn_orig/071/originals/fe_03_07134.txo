R:  Hi, I'm Kirs- --
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.  I'm Kirsten.
L:  [inaudible].  I'm Kelly.
R:  Hi, Kelly.
L:  How are you?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm good.  
L:  Um, so I guess our topic are activities?
R:  Yeah.  Cold weather or warm weather.  I would --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- have to go with warm weather as I sit here tying fishing [LAUGH] string.  
L:  Where you at?
R:  I'm in North Dakota.
L:  Is it warm there though or not?
R:  [COUGH]  Actually it is getting there.  Getting --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- there.  [LAUGH]  Not -- not as warm as I would like it yet.
L:  Okay, but it's okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so why do you prefer outdoor activities?
R:  Um, just because in North Dakota it's too cold in the [LAUGH] winters to do anything.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Plus it's nice.  In the summer -- I have kids so they can run and play outside and in the winter it is just too cold here to play outside.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  And then what kind do you like?  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]  I do -- [LAUGH] I like mostly fishing, camping.
L:  Fishing?  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yep.  That's what we do.  Almost every weekend in the summer.  
L:  Wow.
R:  [inaudible] camp out and we fish.  
L:  [LAUGH]  I always thought fishing was really boring and then somebody took me fishing once --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I was so surprised 'cause it was actually interesting and I didn't believe, you know, that I was gonna like it.  
R:  I agree.  I --
L:  But, yeah, it was fun.  
R:  Yeah.  I -- when I first started fishing I'd just met my husband and I just go out to get a tan.  [LAUGH]  And now I really enjoy it.  We're gonna fish a tournament in a couple of weeks and ...
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah.  How 'bout yourself?  Where are you from?
L:  Um, actually I'm half German and I grew up in Chicago.  Um, but I live in L.A. now.  
R:  So you get nice weather pretty much year round, right?
L:  Yes.  I do.  And, uh, in Chicago it were always -- like people always think it's really cold but it's not really.  It's cold in the winter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but in the summer, like, from, like, May to, let's say, September it's really hot.  I mean, it's like seventy five and above.  So you have a really decent summer.
R:  Yeah, and not a short one either.  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- North Dakota.  It's really nice here in the summer when summer hits, but it takes 'til late June for it to be summer and it's over by the beginning of September.
L:  Yeah, that's how it is Germany.  In Germany it will warm up a little bit but only for like a couple of weeks.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But no, Chicago actually, yeah, it -- it's pretty nice.  And it gets really hot so you can go swimming for, like, a couple of months so it's really nice.  But, you know, L.A. of course is, um, is -- is -- is even better.  So as far as activities I, um, I think I like out- outdoor activities better too.  I mean, like, I like swimming.  You know, going for walks.  Roller blading.  Um, I like all that too.  But then I'm also a big fan of gymnastics.  I do gymnastics.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  And they see --
R:  I was a gymnast for many years.
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah.  'Til I was seventeen years old.  I -- from the time I was two 'til I was seventeen I did gymnastics.
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You must've been really good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I wa- -- [MN] I -- I enjoyed it more than anything and then I coached from the time I was fourteen 'til -- until I graduated from my school I coached more than I trained but it was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- still -- I loved it.  It was probably the best thing I ever did.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's hard on your body though.  Let me tell you.  Being -- it being twelve years since I've been in gymnastics I feel more of the [LAUGH] pain now than I did then.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It's hard, I know.  I know.  Because you only work certain muscles and ...  I know.  It's hard.  
R:  The cartilage in your wrist and ankles and all that.  So ...  Let's see --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that was my one indoor activity I did.  I -- I swam and, of course, in the winter in North Dakota I swam inside but in the summer I did all my swimming outside.  And I lifeguarded and all that stuff.  So I enjoy swimming too.  We bike a lot.  Um, I have three small children so as often as we can get them to sit in those little cart [LAUGH] behind our bikes we bike.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But mostly outside we fish and h- -- we hike --
L:  When --
R:  -- a lot.
L:  When I started here, um, you know, hiking?  A lot of people in, uh, California go hiking.  Um, I never thought, I don't know if this sounds like a sport or something, but, um, I did it and I actually like it.  
R:  It is.  It's such good exercise plus it's so nice to see all the ...  I don't know how much wildlife you guys have there but here some of the places we can hike -- we don't have a lot of mountains or anything but we've got hills with tons of, like, forest type trees in it.  We don't have a true forest but you can hike through there and you see, you know, the buffalo and the deer and it's just amazing the animals you can see while you do that.  So we look very forward to June through Au- -- through September here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, hiking.  I don't know.  Um, y- you have pretty decent -- like pretty, um, big mountains in California but, yeah, you can also just go h- hike in the hills.  
R:  Have you [MN] --
L:  So, and then --  
R:  Go ahead.
L:  California doesn't really have trees.  It's more like [MN] like it's not really trees.  It's like tree, tree type kind of like things.  I don't know how to say.  You know like big tall trees, like they will grow everywhere?
R:  Right.
L:  They don't grow here.  I think it's too hot.  
R:  That could be.  Definitely.
L:  Yeah, it's almost like -- it's not desert yet but it's kind of like [MN] like a lot of, like, cactuses and stuff like that.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, it's kind of like the -- the, um, wildlife.  It's -- you can see that it's -- it's -- it's starting to become Mexico or something.
R:  Right.  I believe that.
L:  'Cause -- 
R:  'Cause we have -- I haven't been to California since I was probably, oh, maybe twelve years old.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
R:  So we're gonna -- we're actually going this November to California.  To Disneyland.  So I'm pretty excited.  'Cause see --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Where is Disneyland?  I don't even know.
R:  [MN]  To be real honest, I'm not sure.  We're actually gonna fly into Arizona.  My mother in law lives there in the winter.  And we're gonna fly into Arizona and she said it's about a four and half hour drive from her house, so not real [LAUGH] sure.  It's been a long time since I've been that way.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And it'll be -- I'm not sure if it's, you know, how different the country is there from Los Angeles.  I don't have any idea.  It will be interesting to see.
L:  And, um, as far as indoor.  Do you guys like any, um, like let's say ping pong or ...
R:  You know, I --
L:  Any --
R:  I can- -- I really can't think of indoor sports other than gymnastics.  Um, my youngest daughter is in gymnastics and she likes that so I enjoy going to watch.  But other than that ...
L:  Going to they gym?
R:  Um, we do.  We go -- we do what's called our [inaudible] system here, but [MN] I guess I really never done many indoor activities.  In the winter I go do the [inaudible], which is like a workout machine.  I do that three times a week in the winter just because I don't get to go outside here.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But other than that I really don't -- we don't do much for indoor activities [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- actually I don't either.  
R:  There's really not [LAUGH] much to do.  
L:  There's not too much to do.  I know.  
R:  It's -- it's amazing how different it is from summer to winter around here as far as things to do.  I mean the kids play baseball and basketball and all that stuff, but they play it outside in the summer.  So ...
L:  But you can do that indoors too, though. 
R:  Yeah, you can.  You can.
L:  Basketball especially.
R:  And it's -- I enjoy watching.  I'm not a big basketball player but I enjoy watching it.  I like football.  I love watching football.  So I guess that's kind of an in- -- oh, it's not really an indoor sport either but it's more of a cold winter sport.  
L:  Yeah.  Oh, hockey?  You like hockey?
R:  Hockey I enjoy.  I'm not a huge hockey fan by -- but it is fun to watch.  We have a semi pro team here.
L:  Yes.
R:  What do you do for indoor activities?
L:  Um, I really don't.  Like I told you, I'll do gymnastics.  I'll go to the gym occasionally.  I sometimes go swim in the winter but not a lot because I -- I prefer, you know, going outdoors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't really like to go inside.  Like when I was, um, in Germany I would go because, you know, you hardly get a chance to go swimming outside so you just kind of have to.
R:  Right.  
L:  But, um, other than that I don't -- I don't know.  When I was in high school I played basketball a lot.  
R:  Did you?
L:  So ...  Yeah.  And I was kind -- yeah, I loved basketball.  So I would do that indoors.  Um, sometimes I would play, you know, like table tennis indoors.
R:  Okay.
L:  But not anymore really.  
R:  Now how long have you been here from Germany?
L:  Oh, I came here when I was, um, twelve years old.  Like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- ten years -- ten years, twelve years.
R:  Do you go back to visit?
L:  No.  
R:  [NOISE]  No?
L:  Not really.  No, not -- no.  Re- -- I'll go one day but I'm not excited about it.  
R:  I'm -- my -- all of my family, um, from my grandparents on lived in Germany so ...
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  I would like to go just to see the heritage.  I've never been there before.
L:  Oh, you should.  
R:  [MN]
L:  But it's -- it's very different 'cause it has a -- a very many immigrants so it's very mixed now.  
R:  I believe that.  
L:  Like ten percent.  It's like the number one [MN] country for people to immigrate from, you know, like -- different nations than in the States but still, you know, a lot of immigrants.
R:  Right.
L:  You don't believe it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, you should check it out.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I would.  I would love to.  So over there you said that you didn't have much for summer.  You had more
