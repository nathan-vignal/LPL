L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name's Donny and I'm from Washington DC, um ...
R:  From where?
L:  [MN]  Washington DC.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  I -- I'm Suzanne.  [SIGH]  I'm from ... near there.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, cool!  [SIGH]  Um, ah, what do you think about this?
R:  Well, I've actually talked about it before.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Um, do you know if we're allowed to do that?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I did too, yesterday.  So, it's --
R:  Okay, yeah, yeah, 'cause it's the same topic as yesterday.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] what --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- do I think about it?  I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't have a l- lot of experience with it, so it's not [SIGH] -- it's not, like, something that I can just pull out of [SIGH] nowhere.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, you know, I've seen the ... s- stuff on ... Enron and, um, Martha Stewart on [NOISE] TV.  And I have lot of friends that just graduated [SIGH] [NOISE] from school who ... are having a lot of trouble getting jobs in the business world.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And I'd say t- that ... there's, um, [MN] a general discontent [SIGH] that probably has been, um, [MN] a r- result of all the stuff in the media --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [SIGH] what not.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  A discontent against what?
R:  [SIGH]  I don't know just -- um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- greed in the business world or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I mean at least as ... e- evidenced by these scandals.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- I -- I definitely agree.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't know but, like, I don't know, can you think of anything we can do about that though?  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, [SIGH] I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I imagine it's been happening ... [SIGH] the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- entire time that [SIGH] we've [LAUGH] h- had b- business going on, you know.  [SIGH]  But, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know, I -- I talked to somebody ... yesterday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about, um, with Martha Stewart how it's just stupid to put her in jail.  [MN]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, of course, I had -- t- the impression that, yes, she should be punished --
L:  -- [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] but maybe that's not exactly the type of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- punishment that's gonna ... scare anyone of because [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just gives her a lot of publicity.  It's not -- [SIGH] I don't know it's not, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not as bad as it would be for the typical person.  I mean a- and she's still going to have her money --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- when she --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- gets out.  [LIPSMACK]  So, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- s- she was saying that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this woman was saying that maybe it would be better if we [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- s- sort of a -- a sanction on her that she would be c- checked all the time; m- make a huge fine that she would have to pay --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- because that we really get to her.
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH]  And, um, just have her ... a- always being, like, periodically checked on how she handles things for the rest of her life, like, [SIGH] -- or at least for a while, [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I think that would be [SIGH] maybe more an incentive.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  Because I think everybody's like, "Oh, yeah, they're going to throw Martha Stewart in jail and give her, like, a --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- c- comfortable bed".  [SIGH]  And, like, nice -- sh- -- you -- you know, it just seems ...
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I think that part of the problem is, like, not addressing, like, what's going on but just, like, trying to fit like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something into, like, [SIGH] black or white, like, jail or not, --
R:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that sort of thing.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I mean we ... could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be wrong then because I -- I ... honestly d- don't know enough about, [SIGH] what --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- they're deciding with regards to her punishment.  You know, I haven't [LIPSMACK] -- didn't really talk about it that much on the news.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Maybe it's like a one liner and I'm missing it but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I guess we're all assuming that it's either jail or no jail?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, well it seems like she's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean I didn't go in there yet because, like, she just plead, like, not guilty as far as I understand.  [SIGH]  So, it's like the sentencing phase is like, far, far away from now.  [SIGH]  So, that I -- I don't know what she's facing or what, like, [SIGH] you know, the prosecutor has come up with for her.  [NOISE]  I don't know, but [MN] --
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Y- yeah, I -- I just -- like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't even know what I would suggest the government -- but [SIGH] I'm impressed that we're at least ... getting the sca- -- it -- it's kind of like a double edge sword because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [MN] by, ah, making the scandals known to everyone.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And there're -- I mean they're a big deal all over the news, Enron and [SIGH] -- and, um, countless others -- that have happened in the last few years.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's been good because it shows that the government cares and that ... they won't stand for the sort of, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, g- greed.  [SIGH]  Ah, I don't even know what else --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to call it.
L:  Do you think that's true though?
R:  [SIGH]  Well, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe it's just a show.  [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because it was a double edge sword because they show that they're against it and they're punishing these people, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but then at the same time, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- um, I -- I feel like it ... disillusions us about the business world [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and pro- -- makes us wonder whether there are thousands of other situations like this that aren't being --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- addressed.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause that's what it makes me thing, but I think --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [MN] some people might be like, "Oh, well, the government's taking care of it" you know.
L:  Well, like, I don't know when Enron came out and hid and all that that.  [SIGH]  Like, my immediate reaction was, like, [SIGH] you got to be -- be kidding me that you don't think that this happens, like, all the time with all sorts of companies.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And, like, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- ah, I -- I really think it does and I think the government's what maintains that.  [SIGH]  Then, like, I don't w- why certain companies are picked for, like, [SIGH] coming down on but I really think it's wide spread and I think the government's part of it, personally.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's really a good point.  And, you know, now that I think about it, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [SIGH] um, I wouldn't ... be surprised if -- if, you know, maybe I watch too m- -- too many movies --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, um, if c- companies that sort of, um, t- threaten the government at some point or something, [SIGH] you know, maybe one of those executives ... got on somebody's bad side in -- in NDC.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.
R:  I mean, I don't know whether -- but that [SIGH] makes you --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- think like that, at least.  I mean I'm -- I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not at interested in going into the business world --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because it's just not part of my [SIGH] p- personality to ... to be after the buck [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  -- [SIGH] or whatever.
L:  Cool.  [SIGH]
R:  But I think there are a lot people that ... can do that with integrity and, I mean, that's what I hope.  But I guess that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you get disillusioned.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I don't know, like,- -- I also -- I do some work with, -- like, against, like genetic- ah, genetically altered food.  And, like, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the whole biotech industry development sort of thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  And, um, it's really seems that, like, the heads of a lot of these biotech companies that are, like, p- promoting and, like, creating all these, like, weird scary things, [SIGH] are, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going back and forth between being the heads of, like, the FTAA or the FTA stuff that, like, it's making decisions on how to regulate it.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Really?
L:  And to -- to that, like, it really scares me 'cause, like, [SIGH] you know, it -- it -- they're all, like, part of the same club doing jobs back and forth, like, on both sides of it and, like, that's no way to regulate something.  And it --
R:  No, it's not.
L:  -- and it seems like, I mean that's something I've -- like, you know, studied a lot on but, I -- in other, like, areas it's -- I really suspect probably the same sort of thing going on.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  And --
R:  Well, that's capitalism for you --
L:  Yeah, but probably --
R:  -- e- everybody out for themselves.
L:  -- yeah.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  It's kind of sad.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I don't -- ah, the -- the two people that I've talked to about this [LAUGH] whole problem -- I had to talk to another person -- this is the third conversation --
L:  Oh, no, no.
R:  -- [SIGH] I don't know if I'm going to get paid for [LAUGH] all of them but whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, the -- both of them were, I guess, in their fifties.  And, ... you know, I have this p- passionate way of looking at [SIGH] life and doing good things for people or what not, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [MN] and I -- I can't seem to s- see myself in the business world at all.  And [SIGH] both of them were telling me how t- the real world is like a dog eat dog world and, [SIGH] you know, keep my enthusiasm now but -- but just be ready --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for it to be gone.
L:  That's horrible.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I know but it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean I can see their point --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean I think I'm just ... I'm not saying that everybody should be, ... you know, passionate -- or enthusiastic but [MN] if you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- make your life one that you can be proud of then ... maybe ... you would be more enthusiastic.  And I feel, like, there's [SIGH] so much emphasis in the United States to be, um, individually successful as opposed to a lot of cultures where it's not about the individual as much as it is about the society.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  So, that things like this happen where people are screwing the rest of society and taking their money.  [SIGH]  And since there's only a couple of dollars here and there for stockholders [SIGH] -- or maybe even more, I'm not sure, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] um, they think it's okay, but really t- they're doing it a complete injustice but our ... society dictates that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, t- the American dream is what everybody's going after.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  It's really sad.
L:  Yeah, sure.  And I think also though it's attitudes of the people, like, ... who you were talking too [SIGH] that perpetuates that.  I mean 'cause if you start being, like, okay whatever, [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] like these ... i- ideals don't really matter, it's not realistic, like, "I'm just going to look after number one" and that sort of thing.  [SIGH]  Well, that's what keeps it going, you know?
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  And, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I -- I completely agree.  [SIGH]  And I guess ... maybe that is like the normal transition but, you know, from youth to adulthood for some people but [SIGH] [MN] I don't see why it should be.  I mean, that can't be true because there's so many people who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whose job it is to fight for justice and for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- society being [LAUGH] better.  So, I don't know, --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- [SIGH] maybe they just have a skewed way of looking at it.  [SIGH]  But the -- the sp- -- the sp- -- the, ah, -- the specific, [SIGH] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- scandals and how the government could handle it.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I mean I don't even know where I would begin --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to -- exactly, like, how would you go through -- I mean they just s- should be better at checking their books but, [SIGH] I mean, how would you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- g- go about that?  I -- but maybe this is why I'm not in law.
L:  Y- yeah.  No, like, I don't know, like, I think you either have to, like, somehow make them accountable to, like, [SIGH] the g- general public in a w- wider way and -- but that's -- how -- how do you do that?  And I guess, like, [SIGH] the government's set up s- supposedly theoretically to be a r- representative of the public.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  But, I mean, that's obviously not true.
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And, so, I don't know.  Yeah, it -- it's hard but I -- I think -- yeah, like, I -- I think, you know, it's stems with like you're saying, [SIGH] you know, capitalism in general is always going to have these problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it encourages this.  [SIGH]  Ah --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  And I -- I feel s- ah, people who are in the business world think that capitalism is great.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because, you know, our society -- well, our p- particular --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- c- country happens to be on top of the world right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]  But if -- if every country were to follow capitalism we wouldn't be on top of the world.  I mean, [SIGH] it -- that doesn't really exactly make sense but it does because [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if everybody encouraged everybody else to be a -- an individual [SIGH] going after success, um, [SIGH] I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I just don't think that ... that's a good way to run a world.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Sure.
R:  Like, international relations should not be based on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- individual ... greed.  [LAUGH]  And --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- that's what it seems like.  W- we have these ... c- conflicting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- v- values.  I mean not that I think socialism is okay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or things that would sort of ... because there are f- flaws to it.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But I think people who think capitalism is perfect are -- are wrong too.
L:  Yeah.  No, and I -- I think, also, there's many more alternatives than socialism or capitalism.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, and just finding, like, what works for, like, whatever -- like, [SIGH] group of people or area, or whatever.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that's the important thing.
R:  It sounds like -- I don't if you are [LAUGH] but I'm a t- total Democrat so --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, you know, there should -- are you or no?
L:  Actually, I'm an anarchist so ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good for -- this is a good c- conversation for you then.
L:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah, definitely.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, well how do you do that?  [SIGH]
L:  What do you mean?
R:  How -- well, how do --
