L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Tammy.
R:  Hi, I'm Roxanne.
L:  Yeah, we're supposed to be talking about friends. 
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  Have you done many of these calls?
R:  Um, this is the second call I've done.
L:  Uh, m- me too.  Um, well, let's see.  Do you have a lot of friends or do you have a few close friends?
R:  I mostly have a few close friends.
L:  Yeah, me too.  
R:  I don't like being around large crowds of people.
L:  No, and [NOISE] usually it doesn't work out that way either.  
R:  [MN]
L:  That groups aren't usually friends or ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]  It's usually always like twosies or maybe threesies.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Sounds like you're being paged by your little friend.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  He's supposed to be eating his McNuggets so he can have his Emo[?] toy.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  That toy.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  [MN]  
R:  Are your friends mostly moms or ...?
L:  Yeah.  I think they've changed probably with me.  I mean, I've had 'em and when I do get new friends or anybody that they usually are more my speed as being a mom [LAUGH] now.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And your friends?
R:  Um, my friends.  I really don't have that many down here.  Mostly they're from work 'cause I just moved down to Florida.  Um, before that I had a few at work and then, of course, uh, people I knew from high school.
L:  Yeah.  Well, work actually, since you're there most of your life ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  Makes sense to have those people that you work with --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to be friends.  
R:  But, um, my friends from high school, it's like I moved and I still keep in touch with them through email and that and it's like we've chosen so many different paths.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It's nice to have the email.  It's a lot easier.  
R:  Yes, it is.  
L:  And, of course, cheaper 'cause you don't need the long distance charges.  [MN] 
R:  And some of my friends are online so it's like you can drop 'em a yahoo message or ICQ.  Like, "Hi, I see you.  How you doing?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you can exchange pictures that way.
L:  See I'm not that good yet.  [LAUGH]  I've been playing around with the computer about five years but I'm too afraid to experiment and maybe accidentally do something wrong and have things happen to the computer.  [LAUGH]  So I haven't gotten that far with the pictures or really downloading many things.  I try not to.
R:  Yes.  Um, my niece emails me pictures of her children all the time.  She has a webpage. 
L:  Oh.  That's nice.  That she would know how to do that even.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause I think when you do sign up with the -- the internet's provider --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you do get free webpage or something or ...
R:  Yes.  
L:  And if you know what you're doing you can do that.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I made a webpage, um, of the going away party I had for my old job, my friends at work.  So I've put all the pictures up there.  
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  So everybody can see.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Did you move down to Florida for work?
R:  No.  My family moved down there so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  It's just a little different.  [LAUGH] 
L:  See I had always wanted to go and live down there to work at Disney.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause everyt- anytime I've been to Disney, or you talk about Disney, everybody's always happy and it's so fun and I just kind of figured it would be a good place to work.  But then I was there in, like, August and I thought I was gonna die.  
R:  Yes.  It is warm down here  
L:  [LAUGH]  So, I could not do [LAUGH] that part.
R:  [MN]  I work in outpatient mental health so ...  
L:  Oh.
R:  Some of the people that we have as clients you get to be friends with too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's nice.
L:  [NOISE]  Sh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  Eat.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I -- I just -- [MN] I always sometimes, um, talk to my friends online and once in a while I'll call them on the phone because they have like the penny and a half long distance cards.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  So to call them and catch up with what's new.  
L:  Yeah.  See and then when you get married and you have your husband's friends --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that then you get to meet them and be friends with them, or not.  Or ... [LAUGH] 
R:  And their spouses and ...  Whole package deal.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.  But sometimes it works good and sometimes it doesn't.
R:  Yes.  
L:  And sometimes the extra or the husband, or whoever, has friends that aren't married yet and they think that they should go out.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So it just depends on who you're [NOISE] with friendwise and different lifestyles, I suppose.  And how, well, sure you -- those people would like to go out and meet somebody 'cause they don't have a partner, but they don't need to be taking my married partner.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  So you definitely --
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- have different, uh, people.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  It takes all different lives -- all different walks of life though.  
L:  Oh, then you also get the friends that are your neighbors.  Those are different friends.
R:  Well, see with neighbors it's just waving to them.  It's like, "Hello, how are you, friends?"
L:  Yeah.  Well, we have -- well, now with my son we have neighbor kids.  So now with him playing with them, I'm trying to meet them, or their parents, so that we kind of have that connection then with the kids, so we kind of know what's going on in each other's houses when the kids are playing.
R:  Yes.  I don't know how these people have all these big g- groups of friends and that's like, "Okay, how do you, uh, keep all of them straight".  [LAUGH]. 
L:  Yeah.  I think usually, like, just through school and they got a big group of everybody and --
R:  Yes.
L:  And if no one ever probably would get married --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and if they don't that that's usually -- they just kind of stay like -- kind of like how the -- on TV the Friends show.
R:  Yes.  That's the first thought -- I thought that first this survey was gonna be.  It's like, okay.  +Are we talking about Rachel and the baby or ...?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I didn't watch that in like, try, two years now.  
R:  It's still good.  I didn't use to watch it because I had to work but now that I'm off on those nights I watch it. 
L:  Yeah.  Now that it's staying light longer outside I try to get out there so that my son passes out at a decent [LAUGH] time nowadays.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  He is only three.  
R:  Yeah, I [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  So he's not going to school yet or anything.  
R:  Well, just wait 'til he does and then he goes off with his little friends.  It's gonna feel like [MN] where's my baby go?
L:  Oh, I know.  Right now already I keep watching, checking on him when he's out there playing with anybody.  And checking up on his friends.  [LAUGH]  Some of the friends don't have good intentions so ...
R:  Yes.  Oh, though, we're all like that when we were little though.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  I bet --
L:  But --
R:  -- you can't eat a bug.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yesterday we'd run into that with one of his little friends that just said, "Decided I'd give you this Yu-Gi-Oh card if you eat this".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And it was one of those, um, chives.  Flowers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those purple flowers.  
R:  Yes.
L:  He stuck it in his mouth, took a bite and spit it right out.  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right there you should of just kept going and swallowed it because you tasted it and you didn't get the Yu-Gi-Oh card now did ya?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Which is, kind of, looking back and seeing what kind of friends and what friends do to you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I -- like the whole triple dare.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH]  Uh, I suppose in your life you just get different stages of friends and when you get older you don't go out partying like you used to when you were younger so you try to do family [NOISE] things.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And [NOISE] it's harder to get five people from your family and five people of your friends [NOISE], their whole family all together to do [NOISE] the same things, so I think that's when your family [NOISE] becomes more your friend.
R:  Yes, when they start --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really with their children.  It's like, oh, we have a play date and da da da da da.  
L:  Yeah.  It just gets so hard and how a lot of the k- kids now too have like soccer and volleyball and baseball, and all those different things going and ...  [NOISE]  Oh.
R:  They have so many activities now.  
L:  [NOISE]  Now we kind of actually hang out with my brother and his wife and their kids and do stuff with them.  So that's kind of like more of a, well, a f- a -- a family [LAUGH] friend.  I don't [LAUGH] know. 
R:  Yes.  You probably were ready to kill him when you were younger and then now that you're older ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  'Cause I'm six years older than him.  So we didn't get along because he took everything of mine.
R:  [LAUGH]  Now that you both have families and you have things in common.
L:  You're right.  Then it's different.  And I'm thinking too, did I need or want to have any more children.  Because I only have the one.  What's he gonna do?  So that right there, if I don't have anymore he's gonna end up having to find friends and keep friends because he's not gonna have a brother or sister.
R:  A built in friend.
