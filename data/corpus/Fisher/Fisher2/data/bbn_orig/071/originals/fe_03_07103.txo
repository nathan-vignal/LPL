L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  My name's Mandy.
L:  I'm Kathy.
R:  This is gonna be a hard one.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It is.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It was a -- it was a lot of information.  I couldn't hardly hear her either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you -- did you get all the questions?
L:  I got some of them, I think.  
R:  [SIGH]  I didn't.  I'll tell you that.  All I know is it's about how the government -- illegal corporations.
L:  Well, I think she said something about what could the government do to -- to s- uh, stop, uh, illegal corporate activity?
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And how has, uh, cor- how corporate scandals affected you?  And, I forget.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Too many questions.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, you know, uh, but I guess just basically like if -- if we think there are a lot of corporate crooks out there?
R:  Oh.
L:  And what can be done to -- to stop them if we do?
R:  To stop the corporate crooks?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  That's funny because, uh, I was talking to my boss and we were talking about this, this afternoon, as a matter of fact.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause she thinks that, uh, you know, people should be out there catching terrorists instead of arresting Martha Stewart.
R:  Exactly.  I agree with that.
L:  Yeah.  But on the other hand, then she said, because she's a fair person.  She said, uh, but, you know, the people at Enron they stole a lot of money from people who, uh, now have nothing.  And these -- these guys ought to go to jail and they should be, you know -- 
R:  That's --
L:  -- bankrupted.
R:  That's very true.  That's ve- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a good point.
L:  Yeah.  Because, you know, they -- they -- basically, they might as well kill people.
R:  But then again, too, though another way to look at it too is if they're -- if they're out looking for the terrorists then we're not gonna be hurt.  I -- I don't know.  [MN]  The terrorist --
L:  Well --
R:  The terrorist thing is more important but yet you got to -- you got to -- I mean, it's hurt a lot of people, the Enron thing did.  
L:  Yeah.  I mean, what's the sense of being safe and having, you know, if you -- if you're gonna be broke and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, not be able to live your life anyway?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know.  I mean -- I mean -- I wonder how many people committed suicide 'cause of Enron.
R:  That's what I was getting ready to say.  I wonder how many committed.  There -- there was a -- there was a guy here, he went bankrupt.  He was the, uh, vice president of a big -- big bank --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he, uh, committed suicide because he was in debt -- major debt.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Major.
L:  Yeah, well, that's -- that's the kind of thing that happens.  So, you know, if it happens because of Enron ...
R:  Some people would die anyway.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  But, you know, [MN] it -- if you caused somebody to kill yourself then -- kill themselves then do you have their blood on your hands?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, so is [MN] -- so is that any better than a terrorist?
R:  Exa- you're exactly -- that's exactly right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's funny you were just talking about that today.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's really bizarre.  I mean, and I just happened to walk in her office too.  I don't usually, uh, you know, shoot the breeze with her for more than a couple of minutes but I was in there talking to her about half an hour today.  It's one of those days where everybody wanted to be outside I think, so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And we're all goofing off a little bit.
R:  Well, I work from home so I work --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- outside whenever I want it to be.
L:  Oh, aren't you lucky?
R:  Yeah.  I just --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- just recently started working from home.  
L:  So, well, that -- that's good.  I'd like to do that someday.  
R:  [MN]  It's -- it's challenging.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- challenging.  
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah, because you --
L:  Yeah.  What do you do?
R:  I -- I just started -- I'm, uh, doing trucking.  My husband and my dad are, uh, driving a pick up truck with a goose neck trailer on it.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And I'm getting them loads off the internet and sending them out.
L:  Hey.
R:  It's -- 'cause I just recently had a baby so ...
L:  Yeah, well see that --
R:  I'm trying to stay home with her.
L:  That's what I'm looking at in the next couple of years, and I'm trying to figure out what I can do.
R:  Well, that's what you can do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, if I had somebody to drive the truck.
R:  Well, you can also become a dispatcher.  
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No kidding?
R:  There -- there's a lady I just talked to.  She does it out of her home.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I don't know how -- how you get to do that but ...
L:  Well, you know, I'm gonna look that up on the internet 'cause that's something ...  I was looking at medical transcription.
R:  Yeah.  I've looked at --
L:  'cause, you know --
R:  -- all kinds of stuff.  All that kinds of stuff.  And it's all -- I mean, there's a lot of rip offs out there.
L:  Yeah, there is.  Well, it seems like, you know, there's a pretty good -- couple pretty good outfits out there.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You just have to -- you have to be careful.
R:  Yep.  You do.
L:  You know, you really do.
R:  You do.
L:  'Cause there's -- and plus that you can get accounts in your own town too, if you do medical transcription.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Like you can go to the doctor's office and say, hey, you know.
R:  Well, around -- I live in a small rural area so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you can't -- you can't get that -- find that kind of stuff very often --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- round here.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I live in a small town but there's, you know, there's other towns around.
R:  Yeah --
L:  It's not --
R:  -- there's nothing around me.  
L:  Yeah.  So this must go all over the country then?
R:  Yeah.  I'm in Indiana.
L:  Yeah.  I'm in -- I'm in New Jersey so I'm right, you know, down the road from where the study's taking place but I guess they -- yeah, I guess they do go all over.  
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I have a friend who lives in Indianapolis.  Uh, right outside Indianapolis, actually.
R:  I live about two hours south of Indy.
L:  Yeah.  That's pretty -- I was over here, uh, not too long ago.  Like last year some time for, uh -- right before the Indy five hundred.  
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Like a couple of weeks before and they actually -- right after, maybe, I can't remember.  But they took us to the racetrack.  That thing is huge.
R:  That i- -- and it's fun.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's fun.  I went --
L:  It's -- it's bizarre.
R:  I went to a actual race about six, probably, I don't know, it was probably ten years ago, actually.  Maybe.  My uncle took me.  And, uh, oh, my gosh, it's a blast.  It's a blast. 
L:  It -- I -- I think I'd [MN] just be completely overwhelmed by the -- the noise.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the --
R:  It -- it -- we were --
L:  Everything.
R:  -- right there at the -- at the start.  
L:  Oh, man.
R:  It was wild.
L:  That is really s- -- I can't believe, like they have a -- a nine hole golf course in the center.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  It's -- it's just amazing.  I -- yeah, 'cause you picture, it's like a racetrack.  Like, you think, you know, your high school track or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at least I do.  But it's not.  It's pretty big.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  Anyway I guess we're supposed to be talking about this thing. 
R:  Yeah, what's --
L:  So ...
R:  -- the other -- what was the other thing question?  
L:  Uh, has it affected you?
R:  How has it affected me?  It hasn't.
L:  Or if it has?
R:  It hasn't affected me.  Has it affected you?
L:  Not really, no.  Other than that I get irritated when I see these people parading around and, you know, all their -- y- you know, like you watch the news and you see these people and they've got, uh, you know, all this advice for you on how to invest your money and how to do this and that and I'm thinking, yeah, that's what happened to those people with Enron.
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
L:  You know, they -- they listened to somebody tell 'em how to invest their money.  I mean, I'm seriously thinking about putting all my money under the mattress.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, because it'll earn almost as much interest.
R:  Right.  Exactly. 
L:  The way things are nowadays.
R:  I have a -- a friend.  She works in the marketing.  She's, uh, whatever you call -- what do you call those, uh, people?  Uh ... [MN]  Can't remember what she's called.  She works in Indian- -- out of Indianapolis.  And she --
L:  Mm
R:  -- invested all her -- she invested money into the company and that -- she can draw fro- from it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- and it's at a high interest rate though.
L:  Well, that's nice.  I mean, if she --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, if she can draw, uh, you know, and [several inaudible words] interest rate.
R:  Yeah, she can draw it any -- any time she wants.  But it's -- it's at a -- not a -- not a low, low but, uh, not a real high.  It's -- I think it's around twelve percent.
L:  Oh.  Oh, I see that she can -- she can get back.  Okay.  I see [several inaudible words], yeah.
R:  And then she pays -- she pays it back in.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's kind a like a retirement but it's not a re- retirement.
L:  Yeah, it's like you can get out at any time.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she's -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  She's used it a couple a times.
L:  Yeah, well, you know, it's -- it's good that they have it.  I mean, my sister has stock options in the company she works for.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But they gave 'em to her when their stock was worth, uh, forty dollars a share.  Now it's worth, like, twenty six dollars a share.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [COUGH] it's not -- it's not worth anything.  It's like she would actually lose money.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, if she tried to exercise it so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's just -- just ridiculous.
R:  There's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a lot a, um, actually my husband's great grandmother, he -- she has millions of dollars invested in stocks and bonds.
L:  Wow.
R:  [MN]  She has stocks everywhere.  I mean, the lady is worth millions.  
L: Wow.
R:  And she's constantly watching the stock market.  And she's, like, eighty years old and, you know, she's constantly putting money into it and they're just -- they just go up all the time.  Up and down.  Up and down.  And she just worries, worries, worries if it goes down --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just a little bit.
L:  Well, see that's the other thing.  You have too much money and you have to worry about it all the time but ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  She ha- she has -- I mean, when -- when the lady -- when -- when she passes on, oh, my gosh.
L:  Mm.
R:  She's worth a m- she's worth a lot.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, that -- that's sad that she's not using the money really right now.
L:  Well, it is.  It is, you know.  Because --
R:  But she -- she won't.  Oh, she won't.  She's got it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all invested.
L:  Well, some people, I guess, get more satisfaction out of, uh, you know, having it to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, hoard.
R:  That -- that's -- that's her.  That's her satisfaction.  She just -- she just watches it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Constant.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But -- and that -- that I think's, uh, what separates people, you know.  Like most people want to enjoy their lives and some people just want to ...
R:  That's the way I am.  
L:  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  I don't -- I don't have any -- any stocks.  
L:  No, me neither.  And, like I say, you're probably better off putting your money under the mattress these days.
R:  [LAUGH]  Probably so. 
L:  So, you know, it's just -- I think that really that's the only way it's affected me so far is the, you know, just that I get so irritated when I see these people who've mills wanting ...  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and I just want to kind of go, you know.  How many people did you cheat to get there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  What'd you do?
R:  What?  Right.  How'd you get your money?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, was it honest?  'Cause it almost seems like it, uh, it can't be honest these days.  Or it l- -- one thing my boss was saying is she, uh, she realized a lot of these people that make all this money, they're making it on nothing.  They don't produce anything.  You know, they don't help anybody.  All they do is they take, you know, stuff and they invest stuff in -- i- in other stuff and money changes hands and they get a little bit, and they get a little bit of a whole lot of things and I
