L:  Oh, [SIGH] I'm in Antelope Valley.  [SIGH]  It's like the, ah -- like the desert part -- like ... over here the +weather is very hot.  When it's hot it's hot and when it's cold it's cold.
R:  Oh, ah, so you're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in real southern California?
L:  Y- yeah, really southern California.  That's why I like w- winter [SIGH] [NOISE] and it's outside I can go to the park.  I can run around.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I know it's cold weather, but ... it's better than the summer time.  [NOISE]
R:  Like, what was your temperature today down there?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, [SIGH] hold on.  C- Claudia, oh, how -- it was hot -- wa- -- is -- was it today, like, ah, nine -- ninety two fahrenheit today?  [NOISE]  A hundred and five -- a hundred and two -- a hundred and two between a hundred and five, it was hot.

L:  Yeah, it's hot over here.  Wow, it was hot.
R:  Wow, yeah, that is.  [LAUGH]

R:  -- like, into the ... Cascade Mountains or --
L:  Oh, wow!  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, any trails around here --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- 'cause it is really -- it's very green up here.  It's very --
L:  I k- k- k- know.  [SIGH]
R:  -- more of a moist environment.  So, it's --
L:  [LAUGH]  We're -- we're like desert.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  So, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it is nice 'cause you see, like, lots of different plants and lots of different animals and birds --
L:  Y- yes.  Wow!
R:  -- and everything else.  So, it's ...
L:  Y- y- you guys get snow?  Correct?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  So, what do you do for the out ... doors?  Well, I say -- when it's snowing, what do you do, I mean d- do you go out at all or ...?  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.  Well I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like to ski but I haven't done it for a couple of years.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, I want to go ski.  [SIGH]  The last time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I went when it was winter here, outdoors --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] was the mountains and I tried to ski and I just fell down just [SIGH] ... hurt myself.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Did you ever try again?
L:  [SIGH]  No.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Well, you s- should, you should --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a lot of fun.
L:  [NOISE]  I can't, I'm too chicken.  [LAUGH]
R:  You should go up to Lake Tahoe, too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because that's probably --
L:  Lake Tahoe, yes, I k- k- know.
R:  What is that about two hours from you, [SIGH] or three --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe.
L:  It -- de- -- who- -- de- -- depends who's driving.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  My friend can make -- she made it in an hour, [LAUGH] an hour and a h- [LAUGH] half.
R:  R- right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, believe me she could.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Definitely, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- w- what do you -- when you go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hiking or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whatever you do that -- do you, like, do biking and roller blading and ...?
L:  [NOISE]  In summertime I -- I try not to do a lot of -- a lot of outdoor stuff [NOISE] 'cause like, again, I get -- it -- it gets so hot over here, you do not k- know.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  It's, like, either you do -- like, if I'm hiking or go biking, I do the winter.  I mean [SIGH] people look at me wrong.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But they understand that I get really severe -- I get burnt by the sun, I mean, I actually --
R:  Yeah, it's not --
L:  -- I've got to stay away from the sun.
R:  -- healthy for you either.
L:  No.  And I get ... really dark.  I was really light skinned at one time.  [SIGH]  I took pictures.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yes.  [SIGH]
L:  I compare myself.  This is for me in the winter this is for me in summer.  Look how dark I can be.
R:  Wow!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  How -- well, how hot does it get down there during the winter?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, winter's cold.  I mean it's cold up here.  It's [NOISE] not even summer here.  [SIGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  What is -- what is the coolest weather we have here in -- in it's like below what?  [NOISE]  The be lowest we get here.  I know it snows here sometimes.  Out of the blue, it gets that cold.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  In the forties.
R:  In the forties, yeah, that -- that's pretty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- decent, so then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can get out and, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's when I do my h- hiking and walking, [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my bide riding.  [NOISE]  Yeah, that's what I do for outdoors.  But summertime I stay away.  [NOISE]  I do indoors better.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a hundred and five degrees --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, yes, I'd be --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- indoors all the time.
L:  That's nothing -- that's -- that's the -- it's just started.  [NOISE]  A- around July and August it's worse.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  And it gets that warm ... that weather and then you can hardly do anything.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But I do walk a lot ... in the summer time.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's one I'm -- that's the only thing I do outdoors, walk.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I make sure I wear a baseball cap in summertime, sun block.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  That's what I'm doing, too, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm going to start wearing a baseball cap --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too.  We've been having a little bit of a heat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- snap up here.  [SIGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  And I think it's supposed to be going away but we got up to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- n- ninety yesterday.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, my God!  [SIGH]
R:  And I know y- you being a hundred and five you're like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Yeah, well we're fifteen degrees higher" --
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- but ninety's still pretty hot.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I -- y- yeah, well I'm -- I'm happy if we get ninety here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No doubt, God --
L:  [LAUGH]  Pretty much it's [NOISE] --
R:  -- I guess ninety's a bit like a nice ... s- spring day for you?
L:  -- [SIGH] ah -- ah, a hundred and five and, ah, we go to the pool it's still hot water.  It's, like, warm water.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that's crazy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I can't even -- oh, [SIGH] I don't know how you --
L:  I was --
R:  -- do it.  Have you been down there all your life?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  You know what?  No, I l- -- I -- I live in southern California.  I used to live in Los Angeles [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I moved to Palmdale.  Los Angeles has warm temperatures.  There I can do hiking.  I can do biking.  I can do any outdoor sport there.  It's 'cause it -- t- the weather is more [LIPSMACK] between the middle.  It's very -- very humid.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  It's not too hot, not too cold.  So, you can do a lot of things compared to [SIGH] Antelope Valley.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  A- and it's called Angela?
L:  Antelope ...Valley.  [SIGH]
R:  Antelope Valley.  Okay, I gotcha.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, and if you -- [NOISE] if -- the nearest thing you can find to us is the +airforce -- the airforce base.  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  How long --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, w- why did you move there?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Because we hear that -- like -- I like the weather, you know, the winter weather.  I don't know why.  I lo- -- I'm a winter person.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And the houses over here are affordable [SIGH] and less violence.
R:  That's a good thing.
L:  And, ah -- and you can do a lot of outdoor things here too.  That's the thing about it.  In the city you can't do nothing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  That's --
L:  [NOISE]  Too much -- too much ... things -- bad violence around.  Over here you can -- [SIGH] there's a lot of things you can do.  You can do a lot.  [SIGH]  Beautiful parks.  You can -- [SIGH] like, you can do a lot of things with the kids.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's true.  And --
L:  I like it.
R:  -- that's important too, so.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's -- that is really good.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so, yeah, it's good that you enjoy getting out and hiking and doing all that stuff.  Have you ever been up to -- like, have you been out of California and gone out to --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I, ah, [NOISE] [SIGH] last year I went to Washington to Spokane.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  Spokane, --
L:  It was really nice --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was in Spokane an- and then -- then so I went to Idaho 'cause my friend lives there and then I went to Canada.  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's nice.
L:  I -- I saw a beautiful places there.  [SIGH]  And there was -- also we did a lot more 'cause, um, I think ... S- Spokane [NOISE] has more, um, parks like ... hike trails you can go [SIGH] and you see deers and everything so that's what I did.  It was beautiful.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah, it is.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  So, I went --
R:  It -- would you rather --
L:  -- I went -- I went in wintertime.  I went November so it was kind of cold.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, did you see --
L:  [SIGH]  It was cold.  [NOISE]
R:  -- did you see snow up there?
L:  Yes.  I did, b- beautiful.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's good.  Did -- did -- have you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it doesn't snow where you live then?
L:  [MN]  Sometimes it all depends whether it gets that cold.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  It gets cold but not snow yet.  We -- th- -- there'd be years we do have snow and then that's the best time, I go outdoors make a snowman and have fun.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  So, ... [NOISE] yeah.
R:  'Cause we actually lived in Lake Tahoe last winter.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And we just -- we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- didn't end up finding work down there but we s- stayed there f- for most of the winter and -- and, ah, it was pretty nice.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, we enjoyed the snow and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everything else.  So, ... [SIGH] and it was nice to be able to get outdoors ... there and walk some of the trails and everything else.  It's really pretty there.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I -- I always wanted to do one thing, especially with the outdoors and especially in the wintertime, go camping.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know why, I -- I don't want to do t- the summer camp, I like doing a winter camp.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  It's not humid, you know -- Y- yeah. you know, it's bad enough sleeping in the woods, [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.  It --
L:  -- [SIGH] and that.
R:  -- it's -- actually it's really fun tod do that.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
R:  I've done a lot too.
L:  Have you done it?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- camping's fun.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]  Camping's fun.  You should -- you should definitely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- try to make a time where you -- where you can go camping --
L:  [NOISE]

R:  -- because you'll really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- enjoy the experience.
L:  [SIGH]  [COUGH]  No I went --
R:  It's really cool.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I went camping one time during the summertime [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it was, um, Catalina Island.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So, we went on a boat.  And we stayed over there, like, a whole week.  And the weather was really nice 'cause there was, you know, the b- b- beach [NOISE] and [SIGH] the --
R: Oh, that's perfect.
L:  -- mountains.  [SIGH]  Yeah, so [NOISE] it was --
R:  That must --
L:  -- [SIGH] that was -- that was the best time I went.  I did everything there.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, that must have --
L:  I was running [NOISE] [SIGH] and we --
R:  -- been a lot of fun.
L:  -- did archery and it was very really nice.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, that sounds great, actually.  That's a nice way to go camping too.
L:  [SIGH]  Yes, oh, yes, I l- l- loved it.  [NOISE]  I went to the YMCA programs [SIGH] back in the days.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, very good.  No, those -- see and t- those programs are excellent, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- boys' clubs and girls' clubs --
L:  Y- yes.  
R:  -- those things are great.
L:  They want volunteers -- [SIGH] [NOISE] yes, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- help 'em out.  So, you know, we do get treats in the end but, yeah, [SIGH] but over here it's kind, ah, right now I'm not doing nothing.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  All I'm doing ... at summertime [NOISE] is indoor swimming.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't blame you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would too.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And if I didn't have a pool I'd probably just fill up my b- bath tub --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and use t- that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  In -- in a hundred and five degree temperatures [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  Like today --
R:  -- that's where you'd find me sitting back in a tub --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in an ice cold tub with, like, a --
L:  I k- k- know.  [SIGH]
R:  -- cold beer or something, you know.
L:  [SIGH]  Like today I was telling my friend that I was in the shower [NOISE] taking a cold shower and it's, like -- have you seen the commercials ah, um, [SIGH] um, [NOISE] who is it?  [NOISE]  What -- what is the one shampoo?  [NOISE]  Herbal essence.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  You seen that commercial like she goes, "Oh, yes!"  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  That's what I thought today, a hundred and five caught in a cold shower.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  And that's --
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm like, "Oh, yes, cold water".  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  It's great, yeah, I like those commercials --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where it looks like, you know, they drop 'em in icy water and you see the little pink --
L:  Y- yeah, 'cause I'm like -- [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  So, Oh, my gosh!  So, what part of Washington do you live?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, in Issaquah.  It's right in the --
L:  Issaquah?
R:  -- foothills of the Cascades.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, foothills of the Cascades.  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, right -- like, just not quite in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the Cascades but close enough --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- where it's only about a t- thirty minute, twenty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- drive.
L:  [SIGH]  But I know each state has different weather, I know that.  I know Utah's really hot.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, Utah's like --
L:  I mean all around --
