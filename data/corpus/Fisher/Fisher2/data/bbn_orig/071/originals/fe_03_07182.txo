L:  Hi. 
R:  [MN]
L:  How you doing?  My name's Renee.
R:  I'm Nicole.  
L:  How you doing?  Sounds like you got some kids in the background too.  [NOISE]
R:  I know I've just -- I'm like -- we [MN] -- we're at the dinner table so it's like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm gonna just leave them in there.
L:  [MN]  Oh, 'cause they call -- it just called m- they just called me.  I didn't call anybody.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, they called me [LAUGH] too.  
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  So they had me on hold while they were trying to get you.  And it's like, okay.
L:  Oh, that's funny.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We're taking turns, James.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yes, we are.  Oh.
R:  How old are yours?
L:  I have four and half and my little guy's gonna be two on the twenty third.  
R:  Oh.  Mine are seven and four.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Wild.
L:  Yes, it is.  
R:  That's cool.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That is cool.
L:  Geez.
R:  Now they haven't [MN] told us wha- when to start talking.
L:  Uh, the topic.  The topic was friends.  Do you have a lot of friends and acquaintances or just a few close friends?  That was the topic.  And --
R:  But [MN] usually they prompt us to when they want us to start talking about that.  So I guess we just ...
L:  I think we're supposed to be talking about that now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.   I have --
L:  It --
R:  I usually have lots.  
L:  Oh.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I'm weird that way.  I -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, we've moved from where we used to live so we have a -- we have a good -- we have a couple of good close friends.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we have -- we do have, you know a couple of acquaintances too.  We don't have like a boatload of people we hang out with.  [NOISE]
R:  I think I -- I don't know why.  [MN]  I've been like that since I was a kid where I would have a lot of different ones.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, um, [MN] I always had -- would have like one best friend. 
L:  Hey, you gonna play with that, you get down here. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't want the brackets broken.  The brackets --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- stay here in the grass.  
R:  [MN]  We got --
L:  You gotta take turns.  Hold on a for a second.
R:  That's okay.  
L:  Get it off your head please.  Thank you.  Okay.  Yeah, I -- we've always only had a [MN] -- just -- I've only been like friends with a few people at a time.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I'm more of a shy person.  I'm not a big outgoing type person.  
R:  Mhm.  I'm a, um, I think I always, um, maybe becau- -- I don't know.  I'm a nurse and I think I've always had this certain mentality where, um, I don't know, maybe activities or something the way -- the way I am or the way I communicate it, it seems like it always draws a lot of people in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not -- not intentionally.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  But, um, I let -- it always ends up that way and so I always [LAUGH] end up ...
L:  Oh, what kind -- I'm a nurse too.  What kind of nurse are you?
R:  I -- well, mostly neonatal.  But, um --
L:  Uh, you're kidding.  Same here.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's so cool.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I live in -- here in Delaware and I work at Christiana[?] Hospital so ...
R:  Oh, wow.  I, um --
L:  Uh, that's funny.
R:  I haven't worked [MN] the last two years 'cause I had to have some surgery so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just took a couple of years off and sit back to relax.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And get through this 'cause I always put it off. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]  All those years working all those twelve hour shifts and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- all that overtime and ...
L:  Yeah, I just work for D.M.[?] now so ...
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I'm actually gonna be going back this summer.  
L:  Thank you.  
R:  I miss it.  I realy miss those babies.  [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I can't believe -- and I never thought I'd say that 'cause you know when I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Two years ago I said, "Okay, I've had enough".
L:  Yeah, working 'til full[?] hour, twelve hour shifts that -- that gets really draining.
R:  Yeah, it was crazy.  And then it -- it seemed like wherever I worked they were always shorthanded.  
L:  Oh, right now we're having that problem.  We have, like -- we had, like, sixty babies there two weeks ago.
R:  Oh, no.  
L:  Yeah, we're a pretty big unit but that's -- that's taxing.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Getting enough staff.  
R:  No.  Yeah.  And the staffing.
L:  So everyone has a -- a very heavy work -- caseload which makes it really difficult.  
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If you think -- you think where --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being a nur- --
L:  Hey, hey, hey.
R:  You know some people would say that, you know, we hide in NICU[?].
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  
R:  'Cause it's close -- it is closed off from everything.  
L:  Right.
R:  It's not like, you know, the floor.
L:  It's a separate little fl- -- world.  
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  And then -- and some people would say, you know, taking care of neonates is like taking care of a different life form.  You know, I -- if you ask regular adults, I.C.U. nurses.  
L:  Mm
R:  That's what they say.  Oh, that's --
L:  They don't think --
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah, they don't think what we're doing is as -- some people think that what we- we're doing is not the same as an I.C.U. nurse and I'm like, "You've gotta be kidding me".  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Right. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly the same thing just on a [LAUGH] smaller scale.  
L:  No.
R:  Right.  
L:  I go, yeah.  I go [LAUGH] I go you gotta be kidding [LAUGH] me.
R:  Uh-huh.  Right.  
L:  Very stressful.  I'm like, "How can you even say that?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, what they used to call us in the -- the -- the I.C.- the neonatal I.C.U.  Now they call it special care nursery so people just ... 
R:  S.C.N.  Yeah. 
L:  We're [several inaudible words].
R:  That's right.
L:  I'm like that was not -- that was a big mistake.  They never should have changed the name.
R:  No, definitely.  And you know what --
L:  And people always ask me where I work, I say -- I say the -- the neonatal.  I say N.- N.I.C.U.
R:  I -- I always say NICU.  Neonate 
L:  Yeah.  That's what I say.  NICU.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, that's what I say.  I say, NICU.  I don't say --
R:  Well --
L:  -- special care nursery because people don't realize what that is.  
R:  Right.  
L:  But they think --
R:  That's right.  
L:  -- it's something different. 
R:  Mhm.  That's right.
L:  But, yeah, I mean I have lot of friends at work 'cause there's a hundred nurses that work on the unit but ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  We're a big unit.
R:  Did you find you do some [MN] -- stuff with them outside of work a lot?
L:  It's hard because I -- yeah, working twelve hour shifts and having kids it was really hard.
R:  Right.  
L:  I -- one or -- one or two of the nurses I'll see once in a while, but it's just hard 'cause I work for D.M. and they work, you know, seven eleven.  Seven in the morning and seven at -- 'til seven at night.  
R:  Right.  
L:  So there's really, you know, when they are home they gotta do their errands and they want to spend time with their kids.  It's just really hard.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Everyone has little kids.
R:  It always seemed like it would happen in cycles, like, uh, oh, all of us that would buy houses that, uh, were buying houses at the same time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- would like hang around.  And then it was --
L:  I have to clean it off.
R:  -- [inaudible] everybody who was trying to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get pregnant would hang around.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And everybody was trying to have [several inaudible words] baby.
L:  Mackenzie, you're not playing with that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and swinging at the same time.  Give me that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- please.  
R:  [MN]  
L:  So that's -- so that's funny.  
R:  [MN]  That's wild.
L:  Where do you live?  What -- what state do you live in.
R:  I'm in Florida?
L:  In Florida?  Oh, my gosh.  
R:  Panama City, Florida.  My husband's military so we're stationed here.
L:  Panama, oh.  Oh, my gosh.  Okay.
R:  So we've been, uh, be bopped around and [MN] done it in Texas and California, now Florida.  
L:  Wow.  
R:  And, uh, [MN] I -- I -- my dad was military too and I think -- I'm wondering if, you know, because you pick up [inaudible] --
L:  That probably helps you make friends too, since you guys moved around a lot.
R:  Probably, yeah.  'Cause it was a, you know, having to start at a new school and ...
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, I -- and I've --
R:  That could have a lot to do with it.
L:  -- always -- yeah, I've always been a shy person.  We haven't moved around that much.  
R:  Oh.  What's the weather like up there?
L:  It's finally nice now.  We finally got to the eighties for the first time this year.
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  Yeah, it's been really cloudy and rainy.  
R:  You know, um, I'll be honest with you.  I -- for me, snow to me is [LAUGH] something you go visit and then you leave.  Like you go visit, like a vacation, and ski.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you leave.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, this is Delaware.  We don't ski in Delaware.  
R:  Do you see any snow up there?
L:  Yeah, we get snow.  We got -- we got a really big snowfall this year.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But we don't -- yeah, we don't really -- we -- the year before that we didn't get much at all.  But my husband was saying if we ever did move somewhere it'll be Florida.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  
L:  He's tired of the cold.  
R:  You know, I think -- uh, part of me wonders if we, like, grow out of it or something or ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, they like playing in the snow but I wouldn't -- I wouldn't miss it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I don't like the cold.  
L:  You know.
R:  It's -- I -- you can always cool off but I can't always get warm.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Do you think, um, I think my -- one of my kids is a little on the shy side.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the other one seems like they're more sociable.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I'm sure.  I -- and see my husband and I are opposites.  He's -- he is more shy than I am.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm more extroverted, I guess.  So I ...
L:  Yeah, I think that makes -- I think that makes a big difference.
R:  Are you and your husband opposites too?
L:  Hey, hey, hey.  Sand stays in the sandbox, kids.
R:  [MN]
L:  Actually we're -- we're more alike than we are that way with -- with p- -- we -- we both only have a few good fr- close friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're both like that.
R:  Oh.
L:  But -- but at -- at work it's -- it's funny.  At work we have -- you know, we -- we -- we do talk to, uh, different people but then out- outside work --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's, you know, we have, you know, a couple good friends.  That's pretty much it.  But, you know, at work, you know, it's -- it's funny how we talk more at work sometimes than, like, people in our neighborhood and stuff [inaudible].
R:  Right.  Right.  Mine, um, I have a couple a neighbors that I -- well, one's a nurse [MN] we always have that to talk about, you know.
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  [several inaudible words] in the military and ...
L:  Exactly.  
R:  Um, um, trying to go to -- move to a new state and get your licence changed over and, you know.
L:  Oh, gosh.  
R:  Uh, it's --
L:  Put that down.  
R:  Here it was nightmarish.  Coming to Florida.  So be prepared if you move here.  Start way, way, way in advance.  But, um --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  It was terrible.
L:  Why -- why, where'd you move from?
R:  From California.
L:  Oh.
R:  And California was fast.  Boom.  You know, like, three days after I sent my thing in they had --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it done.  And here, uh-uh.  It took me almost a year.
L:  Wow.
R:  And there was nothing on my -- I mean, I'm boring.  I've never had a reported.  Nothing.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm boring.  But it was -- it was here.  It was their --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- way.  Yeah, so they've --
L:  Well, we're hoping they do that whole multi state [inaudible].  You have one in one state it carries over to the other state.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're trying to do that.  
R:  That's what they need to do.  
L:  They're trying to do that right here where we are in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And they're gonna --
R:  Right.
L:  -- hopefully get that worked out.
R:  They need to do -- do it nationally, you know.
L:  Yeah, that -- that's what they want to do.  They're, yeah, so ...  
R:  If you --
L:  That -- that would just --
R:  And then you can just --
L:  -- make so much more sense.
R:  -- put -- punch in the number online and, you know ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  And they look it up and it's done.  You know.
L:  Right.  I -- I -- I agree.  'Cause we have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to do so many C.E.U.s every two years and -- hey --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- hey, hey.  No we do not do that when someone's swinging.  Get down please.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Get down please.  We're outside on the -- on the swing set.  Thank you.  
R:  [MN]  [LAUGH]  [inaudible].  Now why can't they -- 
L:  He can climb up --
R:  -- call us --
L:  -- but he has to go back down.
R:  -- a- ask us about nursing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, really.  Yeah, ask about our jobs.  We can sit there and chat about that [several inaudible words] is N.I.C.U.  That is so wild.  
R:  I know.  I was amazed.
L:  I -- I talked to a nurse like -- it was like [MN] my second phone call too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But she was, um, uh, she was on med search.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  She was a traveller.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  You know, the last time I was in the [NOISE] hospital --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- everybody that worked there [NOISE] that was an R.N. --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] took care of me that was a [MN] or whatever, were -- were all travellers.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  All the L.V.N.s had been there forever.
L:  Was this Florida?
R:  Yes.  
L:  See Florida's a weird -- that -- that's -- I don't understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that whole thing down there.  
R:  I know.  They just can't keep people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, when we --
L:  I don't think they pay 'em as much do they?
R:  Well, they don't pay as much as they did in California.
L: Back up, Kimmy.
R:  [NOISE]  And when I called to talk to 'em about it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, when we were moving here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- it was trying to tell me, "Oh, well, the cost of living's less".  And it was like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, give me a break.
L:  Yeah, you still need this.
R:  I -- I use --
L:  You still have kids.  You still have expenses.
R:  I was like do
