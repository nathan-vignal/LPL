R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Leigh Tony from San Jose, California.
L:  Hi, Leigh.  I'm Jill from, uh, Kansas City, Missouri.
R:  Wow.  Long way away.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, not kidding.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, um, I'm the kind of person who has a lot of acquaintances and a lot of friends. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, but, uh, I would say I have a few really, really good friends.  
L:  Now see, I'm the opposite.  I have just a few really close friends, um, but I have a lot of acquaintances that I really wouldn't consider friends outside of either work or whatever situation I'm in.  But the friends I do have are really, really close.  My -- like my best friend is a guy and I've had him -- he's been my best friend for [MN] thirteen years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, so I mean, I -- I probably have a handful of friends and, you know, just a bunch of acquaintances that I'm friendly with but ... [LIPSMACK]  So ...
R:  Well, I do, uh, I do have close male friends and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- close female friends so, um, I think that's another thing that I really appreciative of, that's it's more acceptable today than it used to be.  
L:  Sure.  
R:  Um, they used --
L:  What --
R:  -- to say you couldn't just be friends with someone of the opposite sex.
L:  Yeah, I know.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I'm -- and the thing was is that we used -- we used to be, um, more than friends and then we just became friends so it -- it's kinda ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  the opposite way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then it's worked out really well.  And -- and that's actually been kind of the way that [LAUGH] I have a lot of my relationships.
R:  Ha.  You sound very --
L:  So ...
R:  -- young.  
L:  Well, I'm thirty two.  
R:  Are ya?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Well I'm twice as old as you are.  I'm sixty four. 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So, but ...
R:  So I've been around a lot longer to gather a lot more [LAUGH] friends.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So are -- are most of your friends, like, people you work with or in your social [NOISE] circle?
R:  Well, I'm in kind of a little unusual situation.  I'm an actor and a director in theatre.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you get really, really, really close to the people you're working with --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- while the show is running.  And then you kind of go your -- you know, your separate ways and then, perhaps, you will do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- another show together down the road and, you know, you do sometimes keep running into the same people but some you don't see for a long time and, yeah, when you see them again your -- your friendship just starts up where it left.  
L:  [MN]  Well, I bet.  I mean, when you're working with someone that -- that much I bet you do get really close with them.  That's cool.
R:  So ...
L:  Hm.
R:  That's the sit- -- what do you do?
L:  Um, I'm a project manager for tel- [MN] telecommunications.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So, I mean, I guess [NOISE] I -- I do work -- I work with a lot of different people.  [NOISE]  I have a little three year old.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Okay.
L:  He wants [LAUGH] marshmallows.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Geez.  Um, but, I mean, when I work on projects I -- I do, I mean, you become friendly with them but, I guess, I don't take that friendship outside of work, you know --
R:  I see.
L:  -- we're -- we're buddies.
R:  I see.
L:  You know, inside of work and then --
R:  But you don't socialize outside of work?
L:  No, not really.  I guess, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with a three year old.  I -- I used to be a lot more social, you know, and have a lot, you know, more friends that I went out and did stuff with, but [MN] ever since, you know, I've had my -- my little boy we've been more -- more or less home people, you know, and ...
R:  Yeah, your life definitely changes when you --
L:  [MN]
R:  have children.
L:  Holy cow.
R:  I found, uh, I became much more friendly with neighbors --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when I had children than I do now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you have that bond?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  That's -- and that's --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- true.  I guess, you know, that --
R:  So we socialized a lot more.  You know, we bowl --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- together and we had --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- bridge parties together and, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that kind of thing but I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- noticed, um, when I -- I just [MN] -- we moved about seven years ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to a new neighborhood and, um, I -- although we had made friends with the neighbors it's not [MN] not the same at all as when, you know, we first moved into the other area where we all --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- had children and because they were all involved with each other it kind of -- 
L:  Uh.
R:  -- you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- become more involved with each other.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So when your child starts school you'll start to see a difference in the friends you'll make too.
L:  Exact- --
R:  Depending on how involved you get with your child.  You know.  'Cause --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's scouts and there's little league and there's all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those things that bring you into what we call the soccer mom [LAUGH] kind of syndrome.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I can te- -- already see that 'cause, I mean, he's -- he's been -- he's having difficulties, you know, in his social relation and so we've been really in -- he --
R:  More play dates.  He needs more play dates.
L:  Yeah.  We been trying to -- we have neighbors that are about his age so we, you know, make a conscious effort to go in there and -- and make friends and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And be friendly with them so that he learns those social skills and -- and is more, um --
R:  Does he go to daycare?
L:  Yeah, he does.  And then he -- he goes to daycare and then he goes to, um --
R:  Are there a lot of children there?
L:  Yeah.  There are.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, but he's -- he's kinda almost borderline autistic to where --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he -- he kind of is withdrawn in himself sometimes.  But we've -- we've, uh, had him with specialists and, um, um, with, uh, [MN] in a -- in a school for, you know, preschool that, you know, works with those kinds of kids and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- he's really coming out of his shell quite a bit.  And --
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  And he had a lot of problems with speech and, um, being able to --
R:  Yeah, I have friends who have autistic grandchildren and they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have a lot of problems.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of problems.  
L:  And -- and thankfully, I don't think he probably is autistic but he kinda has some of those traits, like echolalia where he repeats things and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, I think he's more or less just kind of a slow learner.  Um --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh.
L:  -- as far as socially but, I mean, he's -- he's really intelligent.  But he just doesn't have the skills to --
R:  He probably will do better on a one on one situation.  Um --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when he's trying to learn, um, the basics.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So, um --
L:  I think so.  
R:  Yeah.  A lot of these phonic things that are out on the market.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Whether it be for reading or for math or whatever.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They work so well if you have a parent who really sits down and works with their child everyday.  It's just phenomenal --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- how good those products are.  I had a grandson who was having a lot of trouble and I worked with him -- I had him one summer and I worked with him everyday and he --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just -- he just went like from zero to a hundred and [LAUGH] fifty.  
L:  Oh, that's awesome.
R:  You know, it's -- it -- yeah.  And they're just excellent programs so if you start --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- noticing that when he starts school that he has those problems you need to look into some of those avenues.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Because --
L:  Well [MN] --
R:  -- a lot of times a child just doesn't get it in a big group but you sit down and do a one on one and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they do really, really well.  
L:  Right.  And -- and he's -- he's really intelligent.  I mean, he's -- he's probably first or second grade level as far as knowing how to write and knows his a, b, c's and animals, all that stuff.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just more the interactions and the -- and the verbal communication that he has problems with.  So we need like Hooked on Phonics for Friends or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, so that --
R:  Well, you have your hands full, my dear.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Have you considered staying home with him until he starts school?
L:  Um, I'm -- I'm the one that makes actually the [LAUGH] most money, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so it's kinda hard to -- 'specially in this environment to -- to actually be on one income because uh, I'm -- I'm not married to his dad but we live together.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's kind of weird with the finances.  Um, so that -- that's probably not a -- an option but we're thinking --
R:  That's too bad.
L:  Yeah, and we're -- we're thinking of moving closer to, um, my family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so that he has that --
R:  You can have more --
L:  -- interaction.
R:  -- support.  Mhm.
L:  Right.  Um, 'cause he really loves spending time with other people and spending time with my family.  
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  You know, people he knows well.  So we're -- we're [MN] considering that but that's in Northern Ireland.  That's really [LAUGH] not where I want to be.  
R:  Well, you know, there are so many avenues now, especially in your field, where women can work at home and it's something you might want to investigate because --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So man- so many of these jobs can be done on a computer and you just, you know, you really can do a lot at home and being home with your child, that time goes so fast.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You just have such a short time to be with them before they go off, and then they're not interested in being with you anymore.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  You know they have their own social life and their own friends and stuff. 
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, and -- and that's something that I've looked into is -- is kind of the telecommuting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and I think probably in, maybe, six months or so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's something I can probably move into, you know, in my current company.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but it's -- it -- we're kind of going through a whole reorganization thing right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's -- it's not a time to --
R:  Not a good [inaudible] time.
L:  -- to be moving around.  
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um, I mean, with -- with a bunch of his, um, medical issues, you know, we need the insurance that my company provides.
R:  Sure.
L:  'Cause they're really good so ...
R:  Sure.  
L:  We're just trying to bide our time and -- and 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- pursue other avenues.  You know, like, you know, the next door neighbors and -- and joining, you know, there's like little music groups.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he -- 'cause he really loves music and we do the horseback riding and -- and swimming and the things that he enjoys that other kids are around.
R:  Right.  You might investigate too some programs they have in libraries.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, in the early evening or -- or Saturdays.  'Cause they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have good programs there too.  
L:  Uh-huh.  And we -- uh, we usually hit, um, you know, Sunday afternoons we usually hit the McDonalds so that the Playland, you --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- know, they can be in a play environment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, s- so that -- that really helps his -- his social skills and he has little friends there.  And so I think he's -- he's, uh, getting to be, you know, a little more of a social butterfly probably --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I -- I need to learn from [LAUGH] him.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause I'm more of a --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- kind of homebody person.  So ...
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah.  Which, I think, we're probably on opposite ends of the spectrum.
R:  Yes.  Absolutely.  I'm just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- gone all the [LAUGH] time.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But I don't have children at home.  I mean, my children are all raised.  I have grandchildren now.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Are they --
R:  So ...
L:  Are they near
