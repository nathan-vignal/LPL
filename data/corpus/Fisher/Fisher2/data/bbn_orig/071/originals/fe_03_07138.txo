L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- is Leanna.  
L:  My name's Peg.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  How are you?
L:  Good.  
R:  Good.
L:  Um, so we're supposed to be talking about if we like to do indoor or outdoor activities?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, I -- I prefer to do, uh, outdoor activities.  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, I do -- actually [MN] probably more indoor than outdoor but I enjoy outdoor a lot, when I do them.
L:  What part of the country -- what part of the country do you live in?
R:  I'm in the south.  How 'bout you?
L:  Oh.  Uh, Phoenix, Arizona.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  So we can do outdoor activities, uh, year round.  
R:  Yes.  Yes.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think so.  I just --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mostly I just do walking and, um, uh, gardening.  A little gardening.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, uh, walking and hiking and, um, I don't do gardening.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, just working around the house.  Working out in the yard.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And the pool and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.  It -- [MN] --
L:  The only time I do indoor activities is -- is whenever it's a hundred and twenty.
R:  Right.  And I'm sure it's that way [LAUGH] in Phoenix, huh?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Really, I do a lot of, um, indoor, um, like aerobics.  I have a lot of aerobics tapes.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And I'll do those when it's too hot outside, which is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, about from here until September.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Um, well I do aerobics but I do those inside at the Y.  
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  I kind of -- I -- I enjoy having my own schedule and not going to an --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- actual class, kind of thing, so ...
L:  Yeah, that would be nice.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  
L:  [MN]  But if I -- if I don't have, uh, that schedule then I would never do exercise so ...
R:  Y- yeah, a lot of people --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- need that, um, structure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff, yeah.  So ...
L:  So, uh, is that all we're supposed to talk about?  Is whether we like to do indoor or outdoor activity?
R:  I -- I -- yeah, I think so.  I -- I wish -- I have only done, um, this, uh, the phone conversation thing once before and I remember --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they went through the topic so quickly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I wish they had -- we had a chance to, like, press a button so that we could repeat them because I want to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- make sure that we've covered everything but ...
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I don't --
L:  Um ...
R:  And I know we're supposed to be talking for ten minutes.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  We're supposed to be talking for ten minutes. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  So ...
L:  Uh, yeah, I know they just need to give more, um, detailed information or to allow us to repeat ...
R:  The question at least.
L:  Yeah, the question.  
R:  Uh, but I think it was, um, what do you prefer, indoor or outdoor activities?
L:  Indoor or outdoor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I prefer outdoors because I -- I love, you know, being out in the sunshine and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  So I -- I prefer doing things outdoor.
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, I really don't mind outdoor as long it's, um, I just [MN] -- I -- I prefer indoors just because we have a lot of bugs in Texas and I just -- they just seem to love me so I try to take the time -- certain times during the day they're, you know, not out in swarms, kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- my main, you know, reason why I don't prefer outdoor activities as my first --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- preference.  So ...
L:  Right.  Um, well, I don't know what else we can say about ...
R:  So you said you liked to work around the house?
L:  [MN]  Out- -- well, outside.  You know, out in the yard and around the pool --
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  Right.  
L:  You know.  When it's not too terribly hot.  You have to do activities like that in the summertime early in the day.
R:  Yes.  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or later in the evening.
R:  Same here.  Although we've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- had a pretty mild summer so far, so it's been conducive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to letting us do outdoor activities.
L:  Mm.  Oh, that's good.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So ...  [MN] --
L:  I know I have -- we have relatives in Pittsburgh and it's, uh, rained most of the spring and, so far, the summer. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So that's why I prefer living out here because it never rains.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And -- yeah.  So are there any other things that you like to do indoor?
L:  Oh, indoor?
R:  Other activities?  Mhm.
L:  Um, well, like I said, I -- I do my, uh, aerobic classes indoor and then when I'm at home indoors, well, then I'm always -- I'm doing housework or, uh, watching TV or reading or something like that.
R:  Right.  I -- I read a lot and I like -- I -- I'm on the internet quite a bit too.
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  So ...
L:  -- so am I.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So I do that.
L:  I do a lot of computer work.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I enjoy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that.  So, um ...  And I enjoy cooking too so, you know --
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  -- I like to do that indoor --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- too.  [SIGH]
L:  And camping.  Um, you know, when we can we like to go, uh, camping.  
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  
L:  In the summertime we have to go up north where it's cooler.  Up to the, um --
R:  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  The -- the temperatures seem to get really high in Arizona --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't they?
L:  Uh, course, you know -- you know in the wintertime, you know, we can go around here, uh, camping.  
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Because it doesn't get as cold --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at ni- -- you know, in the evenings.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, it will -- it gets, you know, thirties but that's not too bad for camping weather.  
R:  No, it's not.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially if you've got one of those campers.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Well, a friend of ours, they -- he had a camper and then he -- he sold it so [LIPSMACK] that was unfortunate.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  
L:  'Cause it came in handy if you want to go, you know, camping and it's, you know, too cold to be out in a tent or something.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um ...  I also enjoy watching movies.  Like, I'm -- I guess you can only really do that indoors.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless you went -- you went to a drive in.  [LAUGH]  Kind of thing.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's another thing we like to do outdoors, is go to the drive in.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, good.  Good.  
L:  'Course, uh, drive ins are a dying breed unfortunately.  
R:  They are, aren't they?  And I --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- think it's such a shame because I remember going to those in high school and ...
L:  Mm.  Mhm.  
R:  So ...
L:  Well, we, um, I think the only drive in around here is in Scottsdale and then it -- it has, uh, six screens.  
R:  Oh, really?  That's a pretty --
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean I think that's [inaudible].
L:  It's pretty big.  So as far as I know that's the only drive in around here.  
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I remember in high school there used to be a, I mean, every town had a drive in.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But not anymore.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, there's also, I like to go to -- or my kids and I, we like to go to water parks in the summer.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Those are always fun.  I -- I take --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or amusement parks.  That's another outdoor activity.  
R:  I don't know if, uh, your water parks have them there but here they have, um, on Friday nights they have, um, oh, they've got a catchy little name for 'em.  It's like movies at the pool or something.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Where they've got, you know, where they'll show a fun family movie on Friday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and Saturday night at the water park.
L:  Yeah.  That would be fun.
R:  [MN]  Uh-huh.  I -- yeah.  Yeah.  That's always fun.  
L:  Mhm. 
R:  So ...  I'd forgotten about that.  
L:  Uh, then there's miniature golf.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or regular golf, you know.
R:  Yeah, I've never been a golf person but ...
L:  Oh, neither have I.  
R:  I enjoy miniature golf.  I mean, you know, with a -- a large group of people it's always fun.
L:  Mhm.  And then out here they also have, uh, skate parks where you -- either on, um, [LIPSMACK], uh, skateboards or, um, inline skates.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Those are pretty popular, aren't they?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  I've never tried it but, um ...
L:  I've done -- I've tried the skates.  Well, years ago in college, a skate park for inline skates.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They were pretty fun.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I know that you [inaudible] or, uh, burn a lot of calories too doing that.  I would think.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do.  
R:  It's just because you can't really stay put on [LAUGH] skates.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  So ...  Anyway ...
L:  So, is our, uh, ten minutes up yet.  Good news.  This is the longest ten minutes I've ever ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  Isn't that funny.  I -- I didn't experience this the first time around, but I -- [MN] it -- it -- I don't know.  I guess it's the whole topic of outdoor activities.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  I've never really, you know, thought of it.  I -- I think they usually come on and they beep you or something.
L:  Well, they usually do but, you know, when they tell they give you, like, a thirty second warning that your ten minutes is up.
R:  R- right.  So, I mean, I'm surprised it hasn't come about ye-
