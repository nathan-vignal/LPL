R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Donna.  I'm in Minneapolis.
R:  Hi, I'm Bill.  I'm in Alabama.
L:  Oh, wow, okay. [SIGH] Um, do you like wi- -- well, like, Alabama, they don't have a winter.
R:  Oh, are you joking?
L:  Oh, come on, I live in Minneapolis.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's forty below here in the winter.
R:  Ah, we didn't get that far down.  We got about ten, twelve below was as cold as we got.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause --
R:  I li- -- I live up toward the mountains in the north part of Alabama.
L:  Oh, okay.  'Cause we're just, like, I mean, it's frigid here. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I can imagine.  I go up to Chicago every now and then.
L:  Well, Chicago's windy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's -- it's, you know, feels cold there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But yeah, that's the whole thing, 'cause that's like, you know -- well, I used to live in Oregon and, like, you know, the whole summer winter thing wasn't a big deal.  But here it's huge, [NOISE] you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, we get -- we get quite a diversity down here.  So, just about anything, you know, you want to do you can, you know, find a season to do it in.  Do you mo- most- -- uh, mo- mostly like, ah, winter or summer sports?
L:  [NOISE] Actually, you know, I can't hear you actually.  There's a huge siren, I don't know if you can hear it, but --
R:  Yeah, I can hear it in the background.
L:  Yeah.  We live by a fire eng- -- fire station. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's convenient, you know, if anything ever happens.
L:  Well, it is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, if we ever get a fire but yeah, [LAUGH] it's, uh, it's -- but yeah, we live, like, a fire station's, like, two blocks from us so --
R:  Mm.
L:  There it went, okay, it's gone.
R:  Okay.  I said, uh, do you like mainly winter type sports or summer?
L:  Um, well, you know, I don't -- I don't like winter type sports. [LAUGH] Um, I'm trying to think of what, you know, I --
R:  Well, I imagine you got some good ice fishing.
L:  Well, I used to actually like downhill skating, I used to like.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was never great -- great at it, so that's -- that's a winter sport.  Um ... you know, but I don't like ice fishing, I'm horrible at skating, um --
R:  Yeah, I've -- I've got a terrible --
L:  I've never been snow -- what?
R:  I've got a terrible sense of balance.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I have very bad balance, yes.  Yeah, I have no balance.  And, um, trying to think, summer -- I mean, summer activities, it's like ... I think summer as, like, taking a walk, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just going out and enjoying.
R:  Yeah, we do a lot of hiking and camping, uh, down here.  And, of course, hunting, being in the south.  Uh, there's -- there's always something in season down here.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, um, you can, you know, camp and -- and go hiking, you know, any time of the year, winter or summer.  I like -- I like both.  We're -- we're about twenty miles away from the highest point in Alabama.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, we've got some -- we've got some beautiful mountain ranges and waterfalls and ...
L:  Oh, see, that's nice.
R:  The state really keeps up the, um, the hiking trails and that type of thing, so, you know, they're well maintained, well policed.  You know, you don't get, [SIGH] uh, you know --
L:  You know --
R:  -- a lot of rowdy people.
L:  Yeah.  See that, that's really -- I mean, that's the whole thing, it's really, you know, when you have that, I mean, 'cause here we're like ... [SIGH] trying to think of -- well, I -- like, we have lakes and trees [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Obviously.
L:  You know, well, lakes and trees, we have lots of lakes and trees.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I mean, if we're gonna get -- there's no, like, mountains anywhere in the Midwest.
R:  Mm.
L:  And ...
R:  Well, there's a few, uh, but you're -- you're getting up awfully close to Canada before you get into even, you know, big hills.
L:  Yeah.  Like, well, Duluth[?] has hills, but that's pretty close to Canada. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, yeah, so it's, um --
R:  Yeah, Mount Chehaa[?] is the, uh, mountain closest to us and it's, like, twenty five thousand feet.  And that's -- that's about twenty thousand feet higher than -- than I am down here in the city.  So --
L:  See, but that -- yeah, I mean, that's --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- that's a huge difference.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's a good change.
L:  You know.  I -- I -- you know, it's kind of, um, it's weird. [SIGH]
R:  Gotta make sure your vehicle's running good if you wanna go up there 'cause those hills, uh, the roads going up there, even though they're well maintained, there's some very sharp drop offs.
L:  Oh, yeah, that -- oh, you know, I was just talking about that.  Like, a friend of mine 'cause he was going out west.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we were talking about -- I used to live in Oregon and we were talking about those mountain roads.  And there's like -- like, you go off the road, you're going down a cliff. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Pretty much.
L:  You know.  And --
R:  But it makes -- makes for some good climbing area, though.
L:  Well, yeah, that would.  I mean, if -- yeah.  I mean, that would be, and -- and that's, um, you know, it's kinda ... you know.  It's interesting 'cause, you know, you never think about that.  I mean, for Alabama.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  'Cause, you know, I mean, I don't know what you think about for Alabama. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the southern part of the state is, you know, fairly flat, uh, but up in the -- we're up in the northeast corner and, um, that's the foothills of the Appalachian chain.  You know, comes almost down to [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, that's right, they -- oh, that -- I -- I forgot all about the Appalachian thing. [NOISE] And now I got a plane.  You can tell I live in, like, uh -- just can you hold on a second, I'm gonna try see if I can figure this out.
R:  Sure.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, wait a second. [NOISE] Are you there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, am I way too loud?
R:  No, no.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  I can hear you better now.  Yeah, we also -- [LAUGH] [NOISE] I live in the middle of the city and so, yes, I get silence and airplanes.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Um, it makes it hard to, like, talk on the phone.
R:  Well, that's a pretty large city.
L:  Yeah, it is a large city, and I do live in the city.  And, um, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Well, the city I live in, the population's only around, uh, thirty five, thirty six thousand.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so it's -- it's a small town.  We live on a dead end road, but it's right by a, uh, the major four lane through town so get -- get a little bit of road traffic but that's about it.  Otherwise it's real quiet.
L:  No, but that -- yeah, there's a -- yeah, I -- I grew up in a -- I grew up in a small town, like eleven thousand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In the middle of nowhere.  It was like the big city for, like, three hours around.
R:  I like -- I like the country too much to -- to live in a big town.  I lived in Chicago for a while and, um, Miami and Orlando and Atlanta.  But I -- I -- I want some place that's, you know, five minutes away from the woods, you know --
L:  Yeah, that -- see, that's good.
R:  -- where I can just get out and get lost there.
L:  Yeah, that's good.  You know, it's like ... yeah, we live [LAUGH] -- we live in a -- no, we live -- yeah, we live in the city here so yeah, it's -- it's weird and -- and -- and that's the whole thing, it's like, um, my inlaws --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have a cabin, which is about, oh, two hours, two and a half hours away.  You know, it's basic, you know, you -- [inaudible] it's a nice cabin and it's on the lake and, you know, and they have a boat and stuff.
R:  Well, that's -- I was -- I was gonna say, with as many lakes as you have up there, you know, I would think boating would be a real popular pastime.
L:  Boating's huge.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, boating -- boating's big.  Ice fishing, [LIPSMACK] ice fishing is huge.  Um, you know, that kind of stuff.  I don't know, it just, um -- it's weird 'cause, like, we don't ever go up there to the cabin.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  And, um, I think basically 'cause I -- I'm basically -- I'm a city girl.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I've got an eighteen foot canoe and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and we take that up on, uh, Mount Chehaa.  They've got a very large lake up there with a lot of little streams.  Uh, you can go canoeing [NOISE].  Uh, we go up and go kayaking and just inner tubing, get an old truck inner tube and, you know, overstep it and just float down the -- float down the creek.  Nice little, you know, short waterfalls, nothing dangerous.  Uh --
L:  See, that's nice.  And it's like, I mean, like, when you're, like, floating 'cause, like, like, anywhere here that you go inner tubing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, it's a kazillion people inner tubing.
R:  Oh, up -- up there there's so many creeks flowing into that lake that you can always find, you know, a -- a really isolated spot, you know, if you want.
L:  See, that -- that would be nice.  That -- you know, it would be -- it would be really nice.  And that's -- I mean, that's something, 'cause I remember when I li- -- I lived in Oregon -- [LAUGH] [inaudible] I'm back to, uh, the Oregon thing.  And, um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] it's like I was, like, I was going somewhere and I got lost, and I was up [NOISE] in the mountains and I was lost.
R:  Hm.
L:  And then all of a sudden I'm at this, like, incredibly gorgeous lake, [NOISE] there's nobody around, there's deer.
R:  Mm, sounds nice.
L:  It was just -- yeah, it was -- it was so incredible, you know, and I just -- [SIGH] you know, I stopped my car and I just sat there for hours because of just -- it was so unbelievable, it was so gorgeous, you know, and -- yeah, and there was this lake and you could see this mountain behind it, you know, up in the cascades and stuff and, you know, and yeah, there were [LAUGH] these deer.  I mean, it was just amazing watching 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  It's kinda funny, some of the people that I used to go camping with, there was this one young lady in particular that -- that used to love to go camping but she would take her portable battery operated color TV and her laptop computer and her cell phone.
L:  Oh, no. [SIGH]
R:  You know, and she was bringing the city up there and that was -- that was what I was going to get away from.
L:  Yeah, well that -- I mean, that's the whole thing.  It's like, you know, I just -- I don't know, I mean, I think [SIGH] -- I -- I don't know, it's just 'cause, like, vacations, even anywhere I go on vacation, it's like ... all that stuff, I mean, the reason you're on vacation is, you know, you don't have all that stuff.
R:  Yeah.  When I was --
L:  You know.
R:  When I was living down in, uh, Miami, we -- we actually lived on Miami Beach.
L:  Okay.
R:  And people would come down and spend two weeks, you know, in a hotel and drop, you know, tons of money and complain about the heat, and they'd, you know, they wouldn't even go in the ocean, they'd walk out on the beach a couple of times and spend the rest of the time inside, you know, the hotel or, you know, going to places that had air conditioning.  You know, and you can do that at home.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Otherwise what's the point?
L:  You know.  Yeah, well, it is.  I mean, it's just, you know --
