L:  Hello, my name is Erica.
R:  Hi, I'm Jackie.  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, I'm in Savannah, Georgia.  
R:  Cool.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Wow, we're --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- really far apart, aren't we?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I -- I feel like talking about --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the weather but I guess we have to talk about friends.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, we can -- I guess we can [LAUGH] talk about the weather.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, well I have probably a couple a -- I'm more of a closely knit type of person.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have more, uh, close friends than hang out with a big group of people.  
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, um, I'm really pretty much [LAUGH] I try to say to myself I don't have a lot of friends, I have associates.  I only have one best friend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, we've been best friends now for, uh, almost four years and we really -- we don't live in the same city either.  But we live maybe an hour apart.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [COUGH] everybody else I just consider an associate.
R:  An acquaintance?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's -- that's the way I think it is.  I -- I think it was my great grandmother, she told me that if you have, like, five -- if you can count your friends on one hand throughout your whole lifetime --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, [MN] you're really, really blessed.  And I [MN] have only like two [MN] really, uh, like best friends.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That -- like --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- if they called day or night, whatever I been -- at where I put my kid [MN] you know what I'm saying?  Where I'd --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- upset my life for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I used to do all that, upsetting my life when I was younger and drive people here and drive people there and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]  Kind of be a doormat.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not -- not for -- not for my friends but for just a lot of other people and I -- I just don't -- now I just say no.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to -- to be honest I'm actually in that type of a situation where, you know, people that I used to be close to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, you know, like I -- I would do anything for anyone of my friends or acquaintances, you know, because, uh, once upon a time we were close.  But [SIGH] I just got tired of being used, you know.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  They only call -- they only call or they were only around when they needed something.  You know, if -- if -- well, I'm gonna give you an example.  About -- about two weeks ago me and my best friend we were on our way to Saint Simon's Island and I was driving her car and it broke down right at the toll bridge.  I'm not --
R:  +Oh, no.
L:  -- sure if you've ever been in Saint Simon's.  Yeah.  
R:  No, but --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I can -- were there cars backed up?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  +Oh, how embarrassing.  
L:  [LAUGH]  So I called a friend of mine, and me and this girl we had been friends for so long and I would do anything for her because she was -- um, her mother was, you know, on drugs real bad and she [MN] her grandmother had custody of her and she didn't treat her that good e- either, you know.  And she only had me as we were going through school.  We were, you know, high school friends and I would do anything for her.  She also had a -- you know, had a daughter that passed and I kinda helped her get through that.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Because I also had a daughter that passed so, you know, I knew what she was going through.  And I called her up because she's in the navy now.  I called her up because she lived, like, maybe thirty minutes away from Saint Simon's Island and she told me that she'd be there in, like, thirty minutes and she never showed up.  She called me, like, maybe four hours later asking me where I was.  And [LAUGH] --
R:  Where you were?
L:  I just couldn't -- yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm in a broken --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- down car waiting --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- on your butt.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  You know, I just couldn't believe it.  I -- I really thought that, you know, we were closer than that but obviously not.  So I really --
R:  Well, people change too.  That's [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  We all -- sometimes they grow -- people grow apart and --
L:  Well, that's true.  But I felt like, you know, our relationship was much stronger than that.  
R:  And it's hurtful.  
L:  Yes, it is.  It really is.  To know, and then when you have people in your family that knows, like my fiance, you know, he just doesn't let stuff d- die.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, he'll -- "Oh, she's not your friend".  And, you know, I'm like, "Well, I -- I pretty much know that now".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  He needs to stay out of your business.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, seriously.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You're feeling --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- bad enough.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I know [MN].
R:  Gosh, they --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I mean, sometimes men are --
L:  [MN]  [COUGH]
R:  -- I don't care if they're recording this.  They don't have a clue.  Shut up!  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm sitting there like well my lip poked out and he's telling me, I'm like I already know.  You know, [LAUGH] I don't need your input.
R:  Y- yeah.  That's just making me feel so --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- good.  You know when my starts that's kind of stuff it's like right before I'm getting ready to go to bed.  
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then I'm so freaking upset that I can't sleep and I'm having, like, anxiety attacks all [LAUGH] night.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Serious chest pains and I'm, like, I told him.  I said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Don't start this in the mid- -- at this time of night".
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  "Don't even do it man".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know what I'm saying?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like clockwork.  Well --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean I don't think it's malicious but for some reason, I don't ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  It just feels that way.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  
R:  [MN]
L:  No.  No.  Come here.
R:  I -- I have, um, like I said two really good friends.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  One is -- well one lives in this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- general vicinity.  She's about an hour away.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And the other one is out of state.  We keep in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- touch but we're not [MN] um, you know, I have a twelve year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  old daughter and things aren't the same as when you were -- when I -- we were younger.  Like, you know --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- you did everything together and everything is, you know, around your best friends and ...
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
R:  Things ha- -- things change.  So --
L:  The other way.  
R:  You ...
L:  Um, well I've been -- I've been actually [several inaudible words].  I was -- I was born and raised here in Savannah and, um, I moved out of town with my fiance for a while.  [NOISE]  Uh, we have a -- we have a two year old daughter together.
R:  A two or a three?
L:  Two.  
R:  Oh.  Isn't that --
L:  She'll be three in September.
R:  [MN]  Oh, mine --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is a September.  Wh- September what?
L:  Twentieth.
R:  Oh, I'm the -- she's the sixteenth.  
L:  [NOISE]  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  She'll be thirteen.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And she'll be three.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And her [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Yeah, ten years, oh, that's --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- such a beautiful age.  
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Isn't it?
L:  [NOISE]  She is.
R:  So you haven't --
L:  [MN]  [NOISE]
R:  -- heard -- you haven't heard anything else back from that flake?
L:  Um, which -- which place?
R:  The flake.  The lady that never showed. 
L:  Oh, no.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, yeah.  Actually --
R:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry.
L:  -- she -- [LAUGH]  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  But you know what I'm saying?  [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- she -- she called me, like I said, she called me about four hours later and then I just told her that I was totally upset with her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then she called me, like, maybe two or three days ago asking me would I look up a number for her in the phone book.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Oh, well.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  You know what?  We have --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to -- what I always try to do, or what I try to teach my daughter too, is you can't ex- -- if you don't expect anything of anyone then they can't disappoint you.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Because [MN] I think of all the things I've done and screwed up and [MN] if somebody held that stuff against me then [MN] you know, I -- where would I be but the thing is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is I -- I wouldn't keep, um, putting myself out for all these people.  You need to take care of [MN] and I need to take of ourselves first, and our daughters first.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And sons, whatever.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And just not be like a doormat.  That's ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I --
R:  That's what I --
L:  -- have a -- I have a pretty hard time saying no to people.  It's be- -- I mean, I've never -- I've never really been able to tell a person, no.  Because, like I said, I'm the type of person that will give my all.  I will give my last, you know, if you needed it.  You don't even have to be an acquaintance of mine.  If I knew that you needed it and I had it, you had it.  You know, I was -- I'm just that type of person.  
R:  Well, let me tell you --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- something that will maybe [MN] like plant a little seed.  When you say no to something else, like that you don't really want to do or you don't have peace about it, you're saying yes to yourself.  And you have to be a whole person before you can give -- you can't -- if you're empty inside you can't keep giving and giving.  What can you give if you don't have anything, you know, emotionally to give?
L:  Yes.  Sure. 
R:  So [MN] you have to say yes to yourself and if [MN] so just remember when you say no to somebody else it's saying yes to yourself.  And you've got to -- that's not being selfish.  That's -- that's scriptural.  You know.  So --
L:  Go put that back.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I try.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It's okay.  Have you done these phone calls before?
L:  Um, yes, I've done one with the, um, another lady in, I think she was in Kentucky.  I'm not sure.  
R:  Oh.
L:  But she was, like, on the road driving.  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  But she -- she act like she didn't know anything.  She was asking me how much am I getting paid.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, yeah.  [MN]  And I know we're not supposed to discuss that and I told her, I was like, well, it was on the, um, application.  You know, that you filled out on the web.  And she was, like, well, um, when do we get paid and how many --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  [NOISE]
R:  Well, let me think of some more things to talk about as far --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as friends.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you know what I'm doing about friends?  I have like what I 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- call my internet friend.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're in -- you know, when you go to different sites and stuff.  I go to these little freebie si-
