R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, this is Joshua Polson from San Francisco.
L:  [NOISE]  Hi, this is Barbara Garrison from Virginia.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Very good.  [SIGH]  So, what do you think about, ah, corporate scandals?  [SIGH]
L:  W- well, I'm afraid that's a little bit out of my range, really.  I don't -- I mean I don't quite understand it.  [SIGH]  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I know w- we've had some -- some really bad stuff happen --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- just recently.  Um, ...
R:  With all the, ah, the stock market shenanigans and all that?
L:  Y- yes.
R:  [MN]  Well, I think it all boils down to, ah, [COUGH] [SIGH] you can never have enough, you know, the -- the -- the r- rich are greedy, you know?.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, you know, folks are, you know, happy to [MN] -- to make money and do well and -- but they're always willing to maybe, ah, you know, bend the rules and get a little bit more.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  And ... s- sometimes not ... honestly.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, what's this with the, ah, Martha Stewart thing going on now?  Do you understand that?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, I -- I -- I think the basic [SIGH] -- well, the -- the basic accusation is that [LIPSMACK] when you're with, ah, securities, um, there are -- is supposed to be [SIGH] a -- um, kind of, like, a barrier wall between [SIGH] the activities of the company and what kind of internal things are happening there --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and, um, what is telegraphed to the rest of the investment community.  [SIGH]  And so I think what happened, or what they're alleging has happened, [SIGH] is that [COUGH] [MN] she was [LIPSMACK] a personal friend [SIGH] of the CEO of the company.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And so, um, in just speaking to him, [SIGH] ah, she'd bought a bunch of stock in the company, hoping to make a ... nice profit on it,  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, um, he had insider knowledge, being the [SIGH] head of the company, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that there was some unfavorable decisions coming out that had to do with -- 'cause I think they made some kind of drug or something like that, [SIGH] and apparently there were some t- tests that showed that their drug was not successful, or it wasn't going to be approved or something like that.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And he basically ... told her about it [SIGH] and she dumped all her stock.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, and then the next day the stock c- crashed, 'cause t- the news got out to the rest of the public.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, essentially it was an insider trading deal because, you know, you have to say well, either [SIGH] she's, you know, just b- brilliant and had great intuition or --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- someone tipped her off.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And since they're friends.
R:  Y- yeah.  And then there were also -- I mean there were, um, interactions recorded because between her and her broker [SIGH] of, um, discussions and things.  And [SIGH] then apparently [LIPSMACK] I think what got her in trouble, [SIGH] um, 'cause I think there was wiggle room, she could have said, "Well, my broker just called me and I just followed his advice".  But [SIGH] I think what happened is that she then, um, destroyed the records.
L:  Oh!
R:  She tried to cover it up.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And that's what I think let in some problems.
L:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
R:  But, you know, [SIGH] I think -- I think -- I think she'll work out of this one.
L:  Y- yeah, [LAUGH] probably so.
R:  I mean, [LIPSMACK] she sem- -- she seems quite capable [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and, um, [NOISE] you know, it's just ... I'd say a minor setback for her.
L:  Uh-hum.  [PAUSE]
R:  [MN]  'Cause at the end of the day she -- I think she's still a billionaire so [LAUGH] you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, she's doing okay then?
R:  Y- Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Um, she's not exactly out on the street.  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]  Have you been following any of the other, ah, kind of corporate scandals with, ah, Enron?
L:  Oh, yes.  I've heard a lot about Enron.  I don't understand that one either ... but I think there was a lot going on with that one.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, well I know that, u- um, the former head, this guy, Ken Lay, [MN] um, you know, there's been a lot of people they're talking about going after but he's one person they're saying they're not really going to go after, [SIGH] and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that he's v- very close f- friend of, ah, the President.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I think, ah, gave a lot of money [SIGH] to the political campaign and, you know, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- helped him out and now it's -- I think it's pay back time.
L:  Uh-huh.  [PAUSE]
R:  But, ... I think that's pretty common.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah, I'm afraid it is.
R:  Y- yeah, you know, I mean these guys they're [SIGH] you know, they live -- they live fast and they, [LAUGH] you know, [SIGH] go up fast and they go down fast.
L:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah.  [PAUSE]
R:  But, you know, whenever you have that amount of money floating round and, [SIGH] I think, really the issue with Enron is that they -- it wasn't even a real company, they were just, [SIGH] um, [MN] basically inventing [MN] transactions, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, for the purpose of kind of bilking their customers.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, ah, living here in California [SIGH] we actually ended up ... p- paying a lot of those ... high prices 'cause we, ah, deregulated our energy markets.  [SIGH]  And they essentially were selling us energy at, you know, four, five, ten times the amount of money that they -- that the market dictated.  [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And their justification was that there was some kind of open exchange and it was a, [SIGH] you know, a free flow of, ah, buyers and sellers but in fact what happened is th -- there was a [SIGH] -- have you ever seen the movie, um, [LIPSMACK] the, um, [LIPSMACK] -- ah, not The Front but the, ah, yeah -- no, not The Front, the, ah, -- um, you know, Robert Redford, Paul Newman?  Um, --
L:  Oh, I think so -- I -- I can't think of the name of it now but --
R:  -- no, the, ah, [MN] oh, it was -- it was a -- it was a scam, you know, a, um, --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I saw that.
R:  -- what was the name of the movie, now?  It's killing me.
L:  Mm.
R:  Anyhow but they -- they set up a whole phony, [SIGH] um, race track betting, um, [LIPSMACK] -- betting room to make it seem --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- that there was actually betting going on --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] but, in fact, what it was, it was all just a big scam.  [SIGH]  And it's kind of what -- what Enron did.  They basically set up these trading rooms [SIGH] but they weren't trading with anyone.  They were just Enron employees talking to other people on the telephone pretending to ... be trading things.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] that little stunt, though, you know, was -- was worth [MN] +literally billions of dollars that ... they bilked out of, ah, the State of California and ratepayers [SIGH] and people who really had no way of knowing that they were getting bilked.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  And those --
R:  So, --
L:  -- are the people I feel sorry for.
R:  --yeah, they just -- they got [SIGH] and we're -- we're st- -- we have the highest, ah, electric rates now in the country.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And a lot of that money f- flowed out to these guys at Enron and other places [SIGH] and they just went poof!  Just disappeared, you know.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  They haven't paid any of it back that's for sure.
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  So, they're, um, you ma- -- you can choose your own ... electric company or ...?
R:  Well, [MN] [SIGH] that's just a small part of it though.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean really the -- the money -- the big money was made [SIGH] in, um -- in the transmission lines and, um, but yeah the supply [SIGH] was -- is actually -- was purchased by the state itself because there was such a, um, artificial [MN] manipulation of the market --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [MN] that the state jumped in because all of the [SIGH] -- our utilities went bankrupt.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Um, so there was a real problem.  [PAUSE]  I don't know.  Do you have any of those kinds of problems, there?
L:  [MN]  Well, um, I don't understand enough of it to -- you know, to really k- know [SIGH] but, um, I have to -- there's been discussion and I think it's c- coming that [SIGH] we will be able to choose our own electric company.
R:  Uh-hum.  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, but, ah, t- the -- [MN] the actual cost of the electricity is -- I think -- I believe it's just a p- pretty small part --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- of the total, 'cause I think most of the c- cost is actually [LIPSMACK] in the infrastructure --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- to, ah, to move it [SIGH] from -- you know, some kind of central location to -- to your home.  So, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] that's really where a lot of the cost is.  [MN]  So, I don't know.  I mean I know for -- for California it was really a disaster this whole [SIGH] deregulation because it [NOISE] -- it -- it made it sound like it was giving people options but it really -- it didn't because [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] the individual really had no c- control over the cost --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- of what they were buying.
L:  Well, that maybe what'll happen here too.  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope not.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  It hasn't worked out so well for us.
L:  Uh-hum.  So, we don't -- want to look forward to is.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  We don't look forward to it?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I -- I, -- you know, I can't see any real benefit that --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] has come out of it.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I'm perfectly satisfied with the way it is because I think my electricity, [SIGH] -- um, c- compared to other ... energy sources [SIGH] I think my +electric rate is really good.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, I wish they wouldn't mess with it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And do -- is it, ah, do you use it throughout, like, ah, does it -- use it for cooking and ...?
L:  Ah, n- -- my h- heat is gas.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But, um, I use e- electric for everything else.
R:  Uh-hum.  S- so, stove and everything else?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Well [SIGH] --
L:  But, um, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you get so much for your, ah, what you pay for electricity.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I mean I j- just use so many appliances and things, [SIGH] you know, and I don't think that's unreasonable at all.
