R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello, my name is Amanda.
R:  [NOISE] Amanda, hi, this is George in Atlanta.
L:  Hello.  Nice to meet you.
R:  [NOISE] Good to meet you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Okay, well, sounds like an easy subject this time. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It doesn't sound too tough.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Have you done these before?
L:  Um, just once.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, same here.
L:  How 'bout you?  Just once too? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, once before a couple of weeks ago.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I just did mine last week so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] All right. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, um, I guess, uh, do you wanna start or do you want me to start?
R:  [NOISE] Sure, I don't care. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Um, outdoor activities, w- we would prefer, um, warm weather more than anything.  I've lived all over the country, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [NOISE] out of the country, in the country, New England and then mostly in the southeast, and that's what we prefer.  Um, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, those general areas, just where it's fairly warm but not, you know, terribly warm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Not too -- too much humidity.  And we're both fairly athletic and work out a lot so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [NOISE] but not any one particular activity really more than the other, just sort of a good mix.  So, um, we're about thirty minutes from the foothills or the beginning of the mountain -- Georgia mountains.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [NOISE] So, you know, we just jump on one highway and -- and take off and we do a lot of, um, purchasing of homes, renovations and stuff on the side, so we're always --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [NOISE] looking at things like cabins and, you know, we'll go stay in cabins just to kinda get a feel for the area and do just simple, not too elaborate hiking.  You know, we'll go maybe six, eight miles at a time, nothing too major and a little bit of bike riding, um, um, little bit of tennis, little bit of golf.  But again, mostly just social fun, not to really, you know, be too serious about any of it.  But, uh, we prefer definitely the -- the warm weather, although we -- we have taken a few good ski trips, but that's not where we would really wanna live and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] and do that on a regular basis, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um, mostly walking, hiking, bikes, um ... what else?  Um, tennis, I guess, every other week or so.  Very little golf --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [NOISE] but so- -- but enough to count, I guess.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] You know, and just -- just trying to basically just stay in shape.  [MN] We have one mountain, Kennesaw Mountain, ten minutes from us.  It's about a thousand feet and that's just a good one to go do a two mile walk or hike and it's pretty active, with people biking and skateboarding, that kind of thing.
L:  Wow, that sounds really fun. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sounds like you guys have a lot of activities to do there.
R:  [NOISE] Um, it's a pretty good area for it.  The -- the problem is just the traffic is just horrible here.  We've --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- [NOISE] been back here seven years and it's just -- it's -- it's way past anyone, you know, sane wanting to really stay here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] And we're slowly considering moving out of this area, maybe somewhere like Charlotte, which is about fifteen years behind Atlanta.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Still modern, but not, you know, not the traffic and infrastructure problems that we have here.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, the -- the traffic's really causing a problem, you can't get to some of the parks and that kind of thing, and we have just fantastic parks for this area.  Huge, huge, huge.
L:  Yeah, that would be frustrating. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it is a little bit.  Um, you know, we have some really good bike trails.  We actually have a -- a trail that will be extended from the Atlanta area to -- to Birmingham, which is, I guess, maybe around a hundred, hundred and twenty miles of actual bike trails where you never really have to get off of it.  So that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] coming -- coming in the next couple of years or sooner.  But anyway, and then it has all kinds of fun little things to do on the way and, you know, vendors selling things and stuff so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] that's kind of fun.  Now, the traffic can be so bad you can't get to it so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, but anyway, you just kind of do the best you can to work around it.  But we tend to go to the mountains and hike and, um, take our bikes and go do that kind of stuff, and kinda mix it all up so we don't get, you know, too bored or too serious with any of it.  Um, we've done a little rappelling, um ...
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] Um, I've done a little bit of flying, not a lot lately, but that's something we enjoy and just kinda go somewhere where we can, you know, hike from there, catch up with some friends, that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But, um, anyway, what about yourself?
L:  Well, um, I -- we live in, uh, Des Moines, Iowa.  I don't know if you know anything about --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It's been a long time, but I have been through.
L:  Oh, you have?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- it's like a -- it's like a big small town, pretty much.
R:  [NOISE] Right, oh, fun.
L:  It's not -- yeah, it's -- it's, um -- what did you say, I'm sorry?
R:  [NOISE] That sounds fun.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's -- it's fun.  I mean, it's a good place to raise a family.  We have, uh, one child and one on the way, so --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, neat.
L:  -- it's a good place to -- to raise a family, I guess, is what -- what you could say.  Um, but we have -- we enjoy, I would say, the warm weather definitely more, but, um, it seems like we do a lot more cold weather activities.  Um, but since we live in Iowa, we kinda get the -- the best of both worlds.  We get, uh, really hot summers and really cold winters and the fall and spring are usually just -- just right, so, um, I -- I guess we do a lot of skiing.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, fun.
L:  -- we like to go to Colorado, that's one of our big trips, and we like to, um, snowmobile, that's the other thing we do a lot of.  And, um, and, uh, as far as going outside in the warm weather, we kinda just, uh, we like to go to parks, of course, with our little girl and we do a lot of, um, we're not really terribly athletic people [LAUGH] unfortunately, but we're trying to get a little better about that.  Um, we do a lot of bike riding and, um, just like to go on walks.  I take my daughter out for walks at least once a day and ...
R:  Do you have parks close to where you live or ...?
L:  Yeah, but, um, they're -- they're -- well, we have national parks which are probably more what you're -- you would be used to, where it's nice and big and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- lots of -- lots of people and lots more open spaces.  And here in Des Moines it's kind of, you know, just [MN] -- it's kinda just a level state, there's really not anything to climb or really do much with unless you go to a national park and they have a -- or a -- national park, or a state park, I should say.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  And sometimes they have ledges and -- and things like that that you can climb and -- but it's nothing like a mountain. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Right, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  It's just pretty much a big hill.
R:  Right.
L:  But we have -- we have a lot of fun.  We like to go out with -- with our friends and do a lot of barbecuing.  That's pretty much what we do.  We --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, having fun.
L:  -- we just prefer to -- we're pretty laid back people.  We prefer to be outside and -- and relax more than actual having a whole bunch of activities but --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But like I said, we try to do a little better since our daughter's so active and trying to expose her to new and more fun things and ...
R:  [NOISE] What about the ski trips and the snowmobiles, is that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [NOISE] something you really do every year or have done a couple of times?
L:  Yeah, we usually do that, um, at least two or three times a year.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
L:  Um, there's a place in Minnesota that we go, um, when we don't go to Colorado.  'Cause we usually go -- are able to go there about once a year.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  So, we -- we go up to Minnesota.  They have, um --
R:  [NOISE] Have you ever been Egan?
L:  [inaudible].  Uh, is that in Minnesota?
R:  [NOISE] E- Egan, Minnesota, yeah.
L:  I think that might be the one.  I don't remember --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- what that's called that -- I always get mixed up if it's [inaudible] Alps or --
R:  [NOISE] Uh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- or Mankato.  I always get those two names mixed up but --
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  -- I'm pretty sure it's the [inaudible] Alps one.  They call it the Alps, I don't know why, but ...
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  But it's just fun, get -- get a lot of good exercise and get up to the top.  We're gonna, um, take our daughter next year --
R:  [NOISE] Now, can she drive herself --
L:  -- when she's a little older.
R:  -- [NOISE] or how does that work?
L:  No, she's only, um, she's only two so she --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, not yet. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  So, she -- if we were to take her it'd be more of a -- of a -- us probably putting her on one of those, um, waistband things and either putting her -- putting her between -- like, right in front of us or kinda dragging her along type thing.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  So, uh, my brother's the big skier and he pretty much taught me to ski and -- and he takes his kids a lot so he's got all these little tricks he's gonna show us about how to help a little kid ski so we're looking forward --
R:  Have --
L:  -- to that. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Have you ever done, uh, snowboarding?  I haven't tried it but kind of --
L:  No.
R:  -- want to. [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't done snowboarding.  Uh, my husband wants to try but I'm just a little too --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- not too, uh, too keen on that idea --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause I can't skateboard and they say if you can skateboard you can snowboard without a problem but --
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  But [LAUGH] I don't know.  I see a lot of the snowboarders sitting on the side of the mountain and --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- they cut up the mountain so a lot of us usually don't like 'em but [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Right. [LAUGH]
L:  But it's still fun.  You can still have a lot of fun and don't have to be too extra strong to actually know how to ski.  That's pretty much why I like it, too.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  -- I'm not overweight or anything, it's just I don't have the greatest muscle tone so it's nice to be able to ski and still feel like I can actually do something athletic and --
R:  [NOISE] Well, that's a real good workout.
L:  -- it's nice.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I mean, just -- just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, and without even knowing it sometimes, you know, later it's like, "Whoa".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.
R:  [NOISE] Super sore. [LAUGH]
L:  Couple of days later. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  So, do you guys do any skiing or ...?
R:  [NOISE] Um, we've only been married a year, so we haven't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [NOISE] [inaudible] we've been together six years but, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, not together all the time and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] we've both traveled a lot in sales so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [NOISE] things have kind of -- you know, with the economy things have slowed down a little bit and we're doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] more things with -- you know, maybe a little less ex- expensive, close to home and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] she has a thirteen year old son so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] um, he's really more into the computers than anything and, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] we're trying to, "Come on, just come outside --"
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.
R:  [NOISE] "-- go do something with us, whatever it is", you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] It doesn't matter, just activity.  But, um, I've done some skiing.  Um, gosh, not anything too major, Salt Lake City --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] that kind of stuff, yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah, I hear that's --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the best place to ski.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, usually --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- [NOISE] company stuff, you know, with different companies.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You'll go out and -- and so it's not as much fun 'cause you're with, you know, a group you'd rather not [LAUGH] al- always be with. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But, um, Park --
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  -- [NOISE] Park City was my favorite.
L:  Have to see 'em every day --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- and then go skiing with 'em too, that probably wouldn't be too fun. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, smile and yay, this is big fun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] But Park -- Park City was fun.  Um, let's see, I remember I had, like, one eighties or -- and then I tried, like, two oh threes, and just rented, um, skis there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] That was, like, [inaudible] what a big difference.  I mean, just -- you know, I really don't know enough about it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] but just, you know, go down and -- and [inaudible] going down the diamonds, you know, what is it, the black diamond? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, those are the tough ones.
R:  [NOISE] Just like an idiot, I'm like, there is no way that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, my friend I was with is like, you know, "This is one of the kinda intermediate, beginner ones".
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] I'm like, "Oh, my gosh".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I mean, you know, I'm just like stopping every time I ca- -- I can figure out how to stop. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Just flying, but, um, but, you know, it was -- it was fun, definitely a good workout, good people and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] everyone just kinda chilling out and having, you know, cocoa and stuff and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] every time you -- you know, you make it to the bottom, just, "Hey, it's time for a break". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  That's pretty much the group I go with.  Every time we're down at the bottom I'm ready to go back up but they're like, "Oh, gotta rest". [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Can we just do the bunny trail where you hold on to the rope, do that a few times, come back down?"
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that -- that's -- I just --
R:  [NOISE] Keep -- keep our drinks warm. [LAUGH]
L:  That's what I did for about the first two years that we were skiing.  I was like, "Well, I'm gonna just --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- keep on the bunny hills" and then -- and then I started actually finding out what I'm doing and I -- I went down a black -- just by mistake, that's usually the worst, but --
