R:  [LIPSMACK] My name's Tony Abbott.
L:  Hi, my name is Anne Janette.  How are you?
R:  All right, how about yourself?
L:  Good, good.  So, h- how -- how are your friends?  Do you have a lot or do you have --
R:  Oh, there's -- there's a lot.  There's quite a few of them.  They're scattered everywhere, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got 'em out in California, Oklahoma.  I travel a lot.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, did -- I'm kinda settling down a little bit, but they -- they -- they drop by and I see them once in a while.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah --
R:  So, what about your friends?
L:  I was thinking the same thing.  I have a lot of -- I have a few really good friends, but I have a lot of -- of acquaintances and friends.  Um, and I don't know, I -- I seem to be reconnecting with a lot of my friends that I knew, you know --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- several years ago.
R:  -- that happens all the time, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Maybe something's -- something clicked their memory and they'll think, "Yeah, I haven't talked to that person in a while, lemme give them a call". 
L:  Exactly.
R:  "Or give 'em a write" --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know.  Or with the internet, you know, you get a lot more competent, you stay in touch a lot more.
L:  Oh, it's wonderful.  Yeah, that's -- that's w- -- really a great thing.  My -- my grandmother's on the internet now and she -- she always gets to email us too. So, yeah, the e- -- the email is definitely a great thing for --
R:  Well, it's a lot cheaper than the phone calls.
L:  Yes, it is.  It's wonderful.
R:  A- and stamps are going up anyway, so ...
L:  That's right. 
R:  You know, just, you know, not doing -- around -- sitting around the computer just punch in their name -- just chitchat back and forth.
L:  Absolutely.  It's so much easier.
R:  [NOISE] Any [inaudible].
L:  So, where are you from?
R:  I'm -- I'm -- I live in Atlanta here.  Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Oh --
R:  [NOISE] So, where you abouts?
L:  Right in Phoenix.
R:  Phoenix?  That's warm out that direction this time of year, isn't it?
L:  It is warm and it limits what you can do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at this time with anybody, because it's so warm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out, you really try and stay inside most of the time now. 
R:  [NOISE] Well, I don't know it's a different kind of heat in that direction, I -- I think. 
L:  It is a different kind of heat.
R:  Yeah, like out here, it's supposed to got about nine -- about eighty six today, sweat pouring off you, like buckets of water.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The humidity out here will kill you. 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  When it gets ninety, you know, it's hot, it's muggy.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That's when you wanna jump in the pool and cool down something.
L:  That's right. 
R:  So, you ever go to the mountains up in that region?
L:  Um, sure we do.  We -- we try and get out and do a lot of different things, so ...
R:  I used to live in Riverside, California there. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, that's -- I figure that was the central location[?] for everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause we- we'd -- bunch of us would jump in the car and go up to the mountains there, go the snow, [inaudible] dead of -- dead of summer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or we'd go to the beach, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we'd do a lot of it all in one day.
L:  Yeah, that's what's really nice, is that everything is right close by.
R:  Well --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like that song by Sammy Hagar, Can't Do Fifty Five --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that referred to that trip from L.A. to Las Vegas.  You know, you used to make it in four hours, but it takes you all day now, because the speed limit's dropped.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  That's funny.  So, do you travel and [NOISE] see your friends a lot or ...?
R:  Oh, whenever I get a chance to get out that direction.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, I work for the State.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, ah, screen a lot of federal property.
L:  Oh.
R:  A lot of excess federal property, we bring it into the state and s- -- and, uh, sell it to our counties and school systems and stuff.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [SIGH] I got few of -- I got a few friends in other -- other states that do the same thing.  They work for the states too. 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah, it's -- well, you get -- you kinda get the federal -- federal -- federal property back out to the taxpayers. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Huh.
R:  Helps the schools out and everything.  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And tax dollars and counties.
L:  Wow. [PAUSE] [MN]
R:  Let's see, what else? 
L:  I don't know.
R:  It's going to be hot -- it's going to be hot out there tomorrow?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's actually, I think it went from a hundred and eight today to a little bit cooler tomorrow.
R:  Whoa.
L:  Like a hundred and three.  It's just hot. 
R:  Yeah, we're planning on a couple of us running around here to get -- to go out in a boat this weekend, if it don't rain.
L:  Oh, that'd be great.
R:  Well, it's been raining this year.
L:  Yeah, that's what --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I have a lot of friends on the internet --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and everybody in the east is complaining about all the rain.  We have so much sun here that I can't --
R:  Well, we -- we've been in a drought out here for about --
L:  True.
R:  -- four or five years.
L:  Years.
R:  And then all of a sudden it's whammy[?], it's --
L:  Make up for it.
R:  -- starting to rain.  I- it don't bother me a bit. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd rather have it raining than not have no water at all.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we -- we lived in Maryland at one point and it would rain, I swear, on average of, like, every third day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was so much rain.
R:  Well, the bad thing about the raining out here, you know, it won't rain during the week when you need it to, it'll rain on the weekends.
L:  When you wanna do something.
R:  Yeah, and then it knocks the pool balance, the chemicals in the pool all out of whack.
L:  [LAUGH] Of course.
R:  So -- so you're putting more chemicals in that pool to keep it -- keep it balanced out.
L:  Of course. [NOISE] It has to work that way.
R:  Yeah, so I -- I go and get in the boat and we go out in the lake and just jump in the lake water.
L:  So, are you close to a lake?  You said you're [NOISE] from Atlanta.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I'm about -- I'm -- I'm about thirty miles outside of Atlanta, it's just easier to say Atlanta.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I got a -- there's Lake Jackson's about fourteen miles from me.
L:  Oh.  Well, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, it's only about, oh, fifteen, twenty minute drive, so I can get home [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  -- jump in -- get the boat hooked up and take it on down there for a few hours. 
L:  Wow.  That sounds like fun.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Very good.  Do you g- -- do you end up taking friends out with you every time you go or --
R:  Yeah, we --
L:  -- do you go by yourself?
R:  -- there -- a lot -- a lot of times we have [MN] -- we meet down on the lake --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with their boats and stuff, and we just cruise the lake.
L:  Oh, wow. [NOISE]
R:  I got a little seven year old girl.  I'm trying to teach her how to s- -- water ski.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  She likes riding the -- the tube, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- behi- -- tow behind, but now I wanna try to get her up on the skis.
L:  [LAUGH] That's always a challenge.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Sounds like fun.
R:  Like the wife and the kids are going down -- they call it a chick week.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And the wife --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the kids -- daughter -- two daughters, and going to take a couple of friends, are all going to meet down -- go down to Florida for a week.
L:  Oh, that's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oops.
R:  N- nothing wrong with that one, you know --
L:  That's right.
R:  It gives me a break from them for a while.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You --
L:  Oops.
R:  -- lets me catch up on things. 
L:  Yeah, that's nice.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Very good.
R:  [NOISE] It's supposed to rain here tomo- -- Wednesday, so ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I'm fixing on going out and cutting my yard.  Everybod- -- all the neighbors are cutting their yards. 
L:  [LAUGH] Gotta keep up with the Joneses.
R:  Yeah.  I wait until they all cut 'em and then I go out and cut it. 
L:  [LAUGH] Wait until you absolutely have to. 
R:  Yeah, when it gets a little cooler, you know.  Right now it's kinda about eighty six out there and humid.
L:  [MN]
R:  'Bout another hour it'll -- it should cool down a little bit more.
L:  Won't that be good. [PAUSE] Yikes.  Oh, yeah, cause you're several hours different.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's ah, six thirty out here.  It --
L:  Yeah, we got three thirty here. 
R:  Yeah, three hours.
L:  Yeah, it's really hot here now.
R:  Yeah, I believe that.
L:  Go outside and you'd be scorching your feet. 
R:  You know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [PAUSE] There we go.  So, have you done a lot of these phone calls?
R:  No, this is my first one.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah.
R:  Just -- just one way to meet friends too, you know.
L:  That's right.  Ha.
R:  Meet all kinds of people.
L:  That's right.  Well --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- this is my second one.  The other one, I talked to a lady in Canada --
R:  Oh, all right.  That's a nice country up there.  I was up there for about a year. 
L:  I couldn't believe it.  I just -- I thought it was just the U.S. 
R:  No, I -- [inaudible] talk everywhere I believe.
L:  Yep, yep.  So it was interesting.
R:  Yeah, I -- I lived up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, there for about a year.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  
R:  That was some cold weather up in the winter up there.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, it would be.  Wow.  So it sounds like you have friends from all -- all over then.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  That's good. [NOISE] 
R:  I got some friends that moved out to Hawaii there.  I'm thinking about -- might go see.
L:  That's what you gotta do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  In October the kids are out of school for a week here, so we- we're thinking about planning a cruise.
L:  Oh, that would be great --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where would you go?
R:  Oh, well.  We'll see.  We went to Jamaica last time.  I don't know, we might -- might go down to Mexico this time again.
L:  Oh, that'd be fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you -- you've been several cruises --
R:  Yeah, we take -- usually take 'em about once a year.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, we wait until a good -- good -- good price comes along.  
L:  Right.
R:  Last one cost about two hundred dollars a person.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, about five days.
L:  That's fabulous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow. [NOISE] You just know how to get a good deal, I guess.
R:  The internet.
L:  [NOISE] Ah.
R:  Just keep watching, you know, that's -- well, right now the wife and thems all got that down in Florida, you know, they cruised the internet and [SIGH] they put those con- -- timeshares up ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- you know about time shares, don't you?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Well, they -- they put them up every once in a while, people are not going to take 'em, so they throw them out to rent, for a week and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for dirt cheap.
L:  Oh, that's a great idea.  I never thought about looking for that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, you know, the- they -- get the -- well, right now, they got two -- two bedroom condominium for about two hundred and fifty dollars a week.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  So, we got season tickets -- season passes to Busch Gardens down there, so ...
L:  Oh.  That's neat.
R:  Down around Tampa, you know, so that's where they are going.  I like Busch Gardens down there.
L:  Yeah, I have never been to Busch Gardens.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  We have been to Florida, but we haven't ever --
R:  Well, Busch Garden's fun.  You know, it's -- it's -- they got a lot of coasters in there, plus they got the zoo part, wild animals and stuff, so ...
L:  Right.  Now, there's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there's several Busch Gardens across --
R:  The other one in, uh --
L:  -- the U.S., right?
R:  -- there's one up in, ah --
L:  Like, Pennsylvania.
R:  -- Williamsburg, up there, Virginia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It don't have no animals, it just got rides.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  When you got kids, you know, you go -- you go for the kids --
L:  Where the rid- -- oh, yeah.
R:  -- for the rides and the animals.
L:  That's right.  And --
R:  And --
