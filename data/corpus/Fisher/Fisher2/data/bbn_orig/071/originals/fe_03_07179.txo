L:  Hi, my name is Sue.  [NOISE]
R:  My name is Dianne.
L:  Hi, Dianne.  I'm -- I'm from Chicago and [NOISE] college student here and ...
R:  Okay.  
L:  I guess I --
R:  [MN]  You've got a lot of background noise. 
L:  [MN]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.  Can you hear me?
R:  Yes.  Um, I am Dianne from Georgia.  And I have a son that just graduated from college.  In Ohio.
L:  Oh, neat.  Good deal.  [NOISE]  Um --
R:  What college do you go to?
L:  I'm got to a college -- it's called North Park University.  It's pretty small.
R:  Uh-huh.  I have not --
L:  But I've -- 
R:  -- heard of it.
L:  Yeah, I hadn't either and I was from the suburbs so ...
R:  Okay.  
L:  Pretty easy.  What kind of a person would you say you were as far as the friends go?  Clo- a few close ones or ...?
R:  Um, more acquaintances.  I have an awful lot.  Um, not so much since we've moved to this city, you know, as before.  But I have a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very unusual group of friends.  We have a group that met when computers, like, first came out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When it was okay to be in chatrooms.  Um, so probably in ninety one.  Somebody in Indiana started a group called working super moms and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, we've got people from all over the country, coast to coast, and we meet every couple of years.
L:  You actually, like, meet physically or just meet --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- on the internet chatroom or ...?
R:  We meet in person -- not we meet in person. 
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  And, um, we've done really neat things for each other.  My son was at Georgetown one summer and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had to be hospitalized and so I called --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- one of these ladies that I'd never met in person, but I knew she had to be a nice person and she went to the hospital.  [LIPSMACK]  So ...
L:  Wow.  
R:  Um, it -- it's really -- it's a very diverse group but it's just a neat group of people.  And we have one --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- from Chicago.  
L:  W- wow.  And you -- you kept this up for over ten years?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we always --
L:  That's --
R:  -- say we're gonna go on Oprah and tell them about our group but, um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, we haven't done it yet.  
L:  That's really neat though.  'Cause --
R:  It is. 
L:  -- you always hear of, uh, other acquaintances always falling apart when they meet online so ...  But, um, what about people that live close by?  Do you have like a lot of family or anything like that or ...?
R:  Um, we have no family in this town.  We're a hundred miles south of Atlanta.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, we have some family in Atlanta.  But, um, no relatives in town and, you know, we just -- I would say that, you know, most of our friends are the people that we work with or neighbors but, um, we're in a really, what I call, a deep south community.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where, um, you know, everything's based on who you know and who your parents were and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, social circles started probably at birth.  [LAUGH]  For some of --
L:  [LAUGH]  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- these people so ...  Um, it's a very unique place to live.  
L:  And did you say you just re- -- m- moved there within the last few years?  So you kind of, uh, new to them?
R:  No, we um, we were transferred here from Atlanta in eighty -- eighty six.  And I've been --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um -- you know, I'm a native of Ohio so I'm sure they're really interested in how I've developed a southern accent but, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um [LAUGH] you know, I went to school in Ohio and moved to Atlanta and then moved further south.  
L:  Okay.  Wow.  Well, I guess it's my turn, um, to tell you about my friends.  I guess, I -- being in college I, like, can't help but have tons and tons of acquaintances because everyone [NOISE] you meet in class.  And --
R:  Mhm.  Are you in a sorority?
L:  -- all their friends.  I'm not in a sorority.  No.  There's actually no sororities at my school.
R:  Well, that can be good.
L:  Kind of [several inaudible words].  It is.  I -- I think it's kind of nice because we're not -- then we're not split up between the people who are in the sororities and the people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that aren't.  [NOISE] Um, but I live in a dorm that had two hundred and fifty girls in it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I come from a family with six brothers and I was the only --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- girl.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, my gosh.  
L:  So that was quite an adjustment period for a little while.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, so I make lots of acquaintances and then I -- the last -- let's see, this summer I've just moved into an apartment with three other girls.  And so I'm just getting to know their friends.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, uh, probably a few close friends I've developed over the -- over the [NOISE] three years I've been in college so far.  Just people who I had a number of classes with and people that have been my room mates.  
R:  Have you ever --
L:  That I spend more time with.
R:  -- heard -- have you heard of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio?
L:  No, I haven't. 
R:  Well, that's where I went to school, and that's where my son just graduated, and I still keep --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in touch with people --
L:  With --
R:  -- you know, from my college years and I'm fifty one, so ...  Um ...
L:  That's really encouraging.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  You know, your friendships, um, can last a -- a lifetime and I can pick up the phone and talk to one of them like it was just yesterday.  
L:  Wow.
R:  Or we can still relive our memories from our college days, so ...
L:  Right.  
R:  What are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you majoring in?
L:  I'm m- majoring in nursing and Spanish.  
R:  Oh, that's interesting.  So you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- use your -- your Spanish at, um, a bilingual hospital.  
L:  That's -- well, that's I'm hoping.  I'm gonna go -- [inaudible] a third of the population here in Chicago speaks Spanish.  
R:  Oh, I didn't realize --
L:  So --
R:  -- that.
L:  So it's pretty -- it's pretty applicable. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and actually I went and lived in Mexico for four months.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's -- the one -- the one girl who was my room mate down there has become probably one of my very close friends.  One of my closest friends, and I'm planning to live with her starting this next fall.
R:  Well, that's neat.
L:  So ...
R:  You'll definitely have no problems getting a job.  
L:  I hope not.  [LAUGH]  Although --
R:  Well --
L:  -- with the economy you wo- you just wonder about everything.
R:  Well, if you have problems you come to the south because the papers are just covered with, you know, they need nurses so ...
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  What is your son majoring in?
R:  Um, he majored in finance and he does have a job.  
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  That's really good.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  A friend of mine, from high school actually, speaking of keeping up friendships.  I've probably been four years since I spent a decent amount of time with her but her brother graduated with finance and he just hasn't been able to find it very much.  And he's in Indiana.
R:  It has, uh --
L:  But he --
R:  This was just a really rough year to be finding a job.  Um, and he's just --
L:  Yeah, and he's in a really small town just out in the middle of nowhere so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I guess it's not too surprising that he couldn't find -- find --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anything real good.
R:  How did you hear about this phone survey?
L:  Um, my mom [MN] hears about all this kind of stuff.  [LAUGH] 
R:  She must -- does she subscribe to RMC?
L:  I don't know.  Good[?] question.
R:  Okay.  
L:  She does a lot of mystery shopping too.
R:  Uh, yeah.  I do do that too.  
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Yeah, so she probably subscribes to the same online network that I do.
L:  That's very possible.  [MN] It -- it -- did they require like a thirty five dollar start up fee or something or ...?
R:  Um, I pay so much a year and I can't remember.  Thirty five sounds about right.  There's a -- a magazine that comes with it.  
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I know she was saying that there was one -- she hadn't paid for anything except for this one thing that she'd signed up for to be part of.  And that they would send her, you know, information about what jobs were out there.  
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So, maybe that's what --
R:  Okay, so back to friends.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm afraid if we don't stay on topic ...  Um, it's really funny because, uh, often times I can't hear them say what the topic's gonna be and the last time they called I didn't know what the topic was.
L:  Oh, dear.  
R:  And so it was a very hard one to discuss but friends is very easy.  You know what I mean?  It --
L:  Do -- do you have -- yeah.  Do you have any other friends that do mystery shopping?
R:  Um ...
L:  Or are you just [inaudible]?
R:  No.  I'm the only one and I would say that all my friends want to do it because they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- think it's so neat.  But in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this town it's like, well, there's usually just one of each franchise so if I tell my friends about it, you [LAUGH] know, they'll take my job away.  
L:  [LAUGH]  That's right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, um, you know, I'm signed up a with a lot of different companies to do it but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, I've told them about it 'cause they're all kind of envious of what I do.  Like they're real envious of this phone thing.  It's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how do you hear about all this stuff?  How do you do it?  And, you know, I tell +them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I read about it online.  It's out there.  
L:  What kind of -- like, what kind of jobs do your friends have?
R:  Um, I would have to say -- well, actually I have ver- a very diverse group of friends.  You know, a lot of them are teachers but, um, they're really from, you know, just all walks of life.  But, you know, primarily most of my friends are in the education field because that's where I am.  You know. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Over eight hours a day.  [LIPSMACK]  So ...  You know, that would be ...
L:  Wow.  
R:  Um, and even my college friends, 'cause back when we went to college, you know, most of the occupations for women were just either be a teacher [LAUGH] or, um --
L:  Or be a nurse.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Be a nurse.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Or a librarian.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, most of my friends have followed those paths but  ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  Okay.  
R:  Um, you know, I'm, um, in two weeks I'm having dinner with one of my friends that we've -- she lives a hundred miles away so we're getting together with her husband.  We're meeting halfway inbetween for dinner.
L:  Oh, that's great.  
R:  And, um, you know, we taught together probably over twenty years ago.  You know, we met at one of the schools.
L:  And how long -- how many years did you teach together?
R:  Um, we only taught together for probably three years.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And so, you know, our friendship, like, has really, um, you know, it's -- it's been together all that time and they come down to Macon every year to have my husband do their taxes and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LAUGH] so I guess that's kinda -- the tax part's kinda kept us together too.
L:  Right.  
R:  Um ...
L:  Just that yearly contact.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Right.  Yeah.  
L:  That's kinda neat.  I guess, I don't know.  I have a friend of mine that just -- she's about a [MN] -- she's actually about ten years older than I am, but we grew up together and our dads work together.  And she recently, within the last five years, got married and had a child and had moved halfway across the country.  And I was just talking to her on the phone yesterday and it just struck me that even -- even though it's -- we've -- we've lived apart for two, almost three, years now our friendship is solid enough and we were close enough before that time that it -- every -- like -- like you said with your friend, like just when[?] pick up the phone it seems as if it hasn't really -- time hasn't passed at all except for her kid keeps growing older and older.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Well, you know, when, um, I came back to Ohio to drop my son off at college, the very first year when he was a freshman.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The first thing I did was pick up the phone and call somebo-
