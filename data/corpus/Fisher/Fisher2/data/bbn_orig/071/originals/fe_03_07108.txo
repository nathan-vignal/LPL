R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  This is Paula.  Who's this?
L:  Uh, my name is Denise.  
R:  Hi, Denise.
L:  I'm in Virginia.
R:  From Virginia?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Excellent.  Where at?
L:  Uh, Shenandoah Valley?
R:  Oh, [MN] beautiful place in Virginia.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  I'm jealous.  I'm in Florida.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Course it's pretty here too.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  But just a different pretty.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  So how old are you?
L:  I'm thirty three.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm almost fourty four.  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Okay, and today's topic ...
L:  [NOISE]  Thank you, honey.  Okay, I'm on the phone.  Please go.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's hard when you have kids.  That's when they're attracted to you, right?
L:  Oh, or course.  You pick up the phone and they're, like, right there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  How old are they?
L:  I have a four and a half year old, a two and a half year old and an almost eight month old.
R:  Oh, yum.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.  Little ones.
R:  Oh, what fun for you.  Um --
L:  And -- and did you understand the whole topic 'cause she kind of ...?  I didn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- quite understand all of it.
R:  Well, I needed to take notes pretty much.  My daughter had the phone for the first [inaudible] -- so long.  She though it was a prank phone call.  So ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm like, oh, no.  What was the topic?  What was the topic?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Something about, um, scandal in big business.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Has it caused a recession?
L:  I'm guessing they're talking about, like, the Martha Stewart and ...
R:  Yeah, and different, I guess, yeah.
L:  All the Enron and all that.  And ...
R:  I'm not really up a lot on current events.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't even get the newspaper. [LAUGH] 
L:  Good.  I'm not the only one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Good, yeah.  Some things are more important, like your family and ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Keeping them with clothed and fed and happy and ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, uh, as far as causing a recession, [LIPSMACK] I don't think so.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I don't think that that's what's caused it.  
R:  No.
L:  I -- I -- I honestly I, hm.  That's so hard.  This is the second time I've gotten a hard topic from Fisher.
R:  Yeah?
L:  The first one was the war in Iraq.  And I'm going, wait a minute, I thought it wasn't polite to talk about politics.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, we definitely know it's a -- it's a hot button for a lot of people.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  A lot of times.
L:  Definitely.  
R:  You know, people can go off on you.  Um, I think it would have to be a whole lot more companies to cause an actual recession.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't feel like I've really been p- -- that personally affected.  I actually think the war caused more of a ripple effect i- -- of recession than, you know, the scandals here and there.  I think it does cause us to mistrust the companies and mistrust, you know, corporate America even --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- more so.
L:  Yeah.  Especially all these huge conglomerates that think they can do anything.  
R:  Right.
L:  And they can get away with anything.  They do get away with a lot.  
R:  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Most definitely.  
L:  I mean, look at all -- yeah.  Microsoft and what they try to do and now granted we can't live without Microsoft anymore.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, 'cause [LAUGH] they ...
R:  Yeah, I'm M.S.N. dot com, so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  
L:  I -- I rely on it for, you know, just about everything.  
R:  Well. 
L:  I have my M.S.N. messenger that I keep in con- contact with everybody with and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  Very good. 
L:  Yeah, all that stuff so it's like you kind of can't avoid them.  
R:  Right.  
L:  You know, it's like all the big phone companies.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, they -- they [MN] buy out all these tiny little company.  You don't have little companies anymore.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  They're all the big ones.  
R:  Yeah.  That's kind of happening even where I'm working.  The big ones are squashing us, you know.  So ...
L:  Are they?
R:  And even if you offer good service, you know, sometimes it just can't be enough because people shop price.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  So things go overseas.  They get cheap labor.  They can keep lowering and lowering and lowering their cost --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they can up their profit.  Of course, then what we end up with is cheap stuff.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  Really cheap stuff and --
L:  Yes
R:  -- unfortunately a l- a lot of the monies then go to cultures that are actually anti western.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  They -- they don't agree with our religious beliefs that the country was founded on and, you know, some can be very violent.  You know.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I've got my little one in here again.  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm also trying to make dinner at the same time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  Yeah, we got a really late start today and I'm trying an experiment here and it's not going well.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  
L:  But, yeah, I mean -- that -- that's -- that's the truth.  I mean everything's going overseas.  They get cheap parts.  Cheap labor. Um, and then our people get nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and they won- and they wonder why we're in such bad shape and you tell these charities and -- and I'm all for charities and such, but they're all for people, you know, feed the needy overseas.  And feed the needy in this country as well.
R:  Oh, I know.  I want to --
L:  Take care of our own first.
R:  I want to do some kind of mission's work to the kids in like the Appalachian Mountains.
L:  Yeah, I -- yeah, they're so bad off.
R:  I mean, we have desperately poor people here in the United States, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  We can really administer and help them.
L:  Yeah.  And we don't
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  
L:  W- we tend to go towards the -- the foreigners first.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's a shame because I guess [MN] maybe we don't want to believe that we have the problems here. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And maybe we're -- we're putting the blinders on.
R:  I think a lot of people do that.  True.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they put the blinders on and because most of us are too over blessed.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't see the poverty and, you know, the need.  It's a really great need around us as much
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, when people were more hooked up in social groups and tighter in their communities, even in their very own neighborhoods but, I don't know, I just think we've become really alienated.  You know.  And l- like you mention with the computer how much we do with our computers?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that further alienates us.  I mean, when I'm on the computer I [MN] -- I don't want to hear from my daughter, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I [LAUGH] know.
R:  And I love her.  You know.  But I --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  I'm just, like, "Honey, I'm busy right now.  I'm on the computer".  Okay.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I find myself -- [MN] my kids are little and I find myself doing the same thing.  It's like, wait, what's more important here?
R:  Right.
L:  Right.  Forget the mystery shopping jobs and, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  And I'll look for them later.
R:  Oh, you do that too?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's too funny.  [LAUGH]  Well, I've gotta get your email before we hang up because I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've got some stuff for you.  It's -- it's awesome.  Yeah.  I'm working my --
L:  Oh, you do mystery shopping?
R:  Well, I do a little bit of that too, yeah.  
L:  Are you on Lila's Group?
R:  I'm in, um, [LIPSMACK], let's see, money -- money and shopping dot com.
L:  Money and shopping?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't -- haven't quite had enough money to get joined up with that yet.
R:  It's, um, let's see, Angela.
L:  Angela.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And that's my daughter's name.  She just said, yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So I was like, oh, and she does seem really sweet and really efficient and ...
L:  Yeah, she -- she posts a lot on Lila's Lounge.  
R:  Oh, good.  And that's who --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you belong to.  
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's just a yahoo message group.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And, um -- but that's where I learned about the Fisher project.
R:  Oh, awesome.
L:  So, um, and I think it was a lady named Tara she signed -- she posted it and my first call I actually got to speak with another member from Lila's Grou- Lila's Lounge.
R:  Oh, how funny.
L:  And it was so funny because a bunch of us must have signed up at the same time and we all got our calls at the same time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we ended up all talking to other people from the list.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And it was just really funny.
R:  That's hilarious.  Yeah, actually, for me, um, I don't know, I think it was a few days before I finally signed up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've talked to people like mostly on the west coast, I think.
L:  Oh.
R:  But it's pretty wild.  You know, so ...
L:  Yeah, my other call's from a lady in Alabama.
R:  Oh.  That's cool.
L:  So I got another southerner.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's cool.  So it's -- well, actually, I'm in -- I'm from Ohio and I used to live in Virginia.  That's where I met my husband and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- we moved to --
L:  How funny.
R:  -- Florida, so ...
L:  I -- my husband's from Ohio.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yes.
R:  Where abouts?
L:  Jackson?
R:  Jackson, uh ...
L:  Uh, south eastern Ohio.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm from north eastern so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that's probably why I don't know where it is.
L:  Yeah.  It's near, um --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- Ohio University.  Athens campus.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  So it's about forty five minutes outside of that.
R:  Awesome.  
L:  And, um --
R:  I have been to Athens.  I used to go water skiing.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  And, um -- I'm from Jersey.
R:  Well, we've really -- oh, are you?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Originally.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  There's a lot of people from New Jersey and New York down here.  I'm in --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- Port Saint Lucy, Florida.  And it's like one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S.  I think --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it's the fastest or something.  It's ridiculous but ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I moved away from Virginia 'cause I lived inside the belt way up there by --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Washington D.C. to get away from all that competitive --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- you know, phony people type of thing, you know.
L:  I dread driving through there when I go home.
R:  I know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Isn't it a nightmare?
L:  Terrible.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And it's getting worse.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  And everything's all build up and they've got --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so much construction going on and --
R:  No, thank you.
L:  -- they're trying to build this and that and, oh.  It's just -- it's a nightmare.
R:  We used to drive about an hour and a half to Lake Anna, I think it was called.  And go boating.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, my girlfriend's par- -- mom lives out there.
R:  Oh, it's so beautiful.
L:  It is.  
R:  Are -- are we going to be in trouble 'cause we haven't stayed on the topic?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, guess what, I didn't do it with the first one either.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no.  You -- well, maybe that's just part of it.  You know, why?  That --
L:  I think they just --
R:  That topics just not that important to me.  
L:  No.
R:  Is that awful? 
L:  I know.  And I l- I tried to listen to it.
R:  And I'm not knowledgeable about it either.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Same here.  I don't follow the business world.  I have no idea.
R:  There we admitted it.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Let the people that are really concerned and really have wisdom in that area talk --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about it.  Leave -- leave the other ones of us that are ignorant about it alone.  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  I think they just want to hear our -- our voices and dialects anyway.
R:  Yeah.  I don't --
L:  But I think that they give us a topic to, um, [LIPSMACK] to get us started at least.
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  On something in particular, I don't know.
R:  Oh, that's good.  Now I don't feel so bad.  Like I'm not doing the job right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, that's so funny.  That's too funny.  Well, you're definitely the most fun person I've talked too so far.
L:  Oh, well, thank you.
R:  [MN]  +Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It is -- this is neat.  I mean, you get to hear so many different people and --
R:  Oh, it's cool fun.
L:  -- find out that, like, you have so much in common anyway.  It's -- it's just bizarre.  
R:  It is funny.  Yeah, the other calls I've really tried to stay on the subject but, yeah, I guess I knew if they were -- but I guess if I knew really what they were after --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to too much of a degree I would probably not act natural so ...
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [MN]  That's so funny.
L:  I mean, I missed a call and one of the calls was, like, you know, reality TV shows.  I was like, well, I could've talked about that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't watch the silly things but I could've talked about [LAUGH] it.
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I just had my cable shut off 'cause I really don't like all the garbage I get.  I just want clean TV and they can't offer me that.  They can say, oh, for this discount we can give you all this [MN] more garbage, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so you can get more filth in your house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't want that.  I get enough stuff in here that I
