L:  Hello, this is Pamela.
R:  Hi, this is Louise.  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH]  Hi.  Pretty good.  How 'bout you?
R:  Good.  
L:  Good so --
R:  What --
L:  -- were you outside today?
R:  Um, well, we're not actually having the best of weather [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Oh, where are you at?
R:  We're in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh.
R:  And being it's the middle of June you'd think it would be hot, but it really has been kind of in the sixties and rainy.
L:  Oh, that --
R:  So ...
L:  -- sounds like Seattle.  
R:  [MN]
L:  That's where I'm from.
R:  Are you from [LAUGH] Seattle?  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Like --
L:  And it's been hot here.
R:  Oh, has it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Really hot.  
R:  So you probably prefer the indoor activities at this point in time.  Is that right?  [LAUGH] 
L:  It depends on the time of day.  Actually right now it's beautiful outside.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I prefer to be outside now.  But during the day my house stays pretty cool so it's nice to stay inside.
R:  Yeah.  I have, um, [LIPSMACK] four kids and I prefer that they play outside.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And it's [LAUGH] been -- but they seem to be, I think that they've been in 'cause the winters are so long.  Which I guess, you know, you guys have pretty bad winters too as well, don't you?
L:  Uh, well, they're pretty long and they can be rainy but, um, actually out here we can still do a lot outside during the winter so it -- it doesn't get like that cabin fever.  When I lived in the mid west it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a r- real sense of cabin fever.
R:  Yeah.  The- these guys are [several inaudible words].  They got another week off[?] school and it seems like they're not done because the weather just hasn't cooperated.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they, um, go outside anyway.  If there's a break in the rain they go out and they just wipe their stuff down and they -- they play and -- and do all that kind of things.  I think there's just more to do outside.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Than there is inside.  And it's, you know, um, they have a, um, they're kind of into skateboarding and roller blading.  And then, um, we put a trampoline in the backyard --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- maybe two weeks ago, and that --
L:  How 'bout --
R:  -- they would --
L:  How 'bout you?  What --
R:  -- jump in the rain.
L:  Yeah.  What do you like to do?
R:  [MN]  Um, well, mine ju- -- [MN] usually watching [LAUGH] them.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, well I used to live in California.  We were big water skiers so that was my favorite activity.  And then moving here kind of didn't -- we don't get to do that but, um, as a family we kind of like to go bike riding.  And the we- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The weather hasn't cooperated [MN] for -- enough for us to go do that even.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, [MN] ...
L:  Well, if you were to move out to Seattle, we do everything regardless of weather.
R:  Of the weather?  [LAUGH] 
L:  It -- yeah.  One of the things I notice when I came out here.  People golf in the rain.
R:  Oh, geez.
L:  They ride their bikes in the rain.  Everything.  Because, you know, it's not that downpour like the mid west --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where you can still get out there and -- and do [LAUGH] pretty much anything.  It's just this real soft drizzle.
R:  Yeah, well that's pretty good.  Especially if you have the humidity out.  Then --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it -- it should tend to be [MN] I guess refreshing to -- to be wet a little bit.  And I think that's probably what the kids are finally starting to -- to see.  It's like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who cares if we're wet 'cause we're outside.  Um, but for other activities, I kind of like to be out working in the yard or the pool, if we had some sun.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Actually yesterday was probably -- I think it was like eighty yesterday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which they had field day which was really fun 'cause all the whole school was out doing all the fun activities and -- and -- and things and wouldn't you know, my station was -- was in the shade  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everyone else got sunburned.  And I'm standing in the shade.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Which they were probably -- you know, they were hot but then we're back today with, you know, rain and overcast and, I don't know.  [MN]
L:  And you know as far as your kids going out, um, on a field trip.  I think that we can learn so much from nature just being --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- in nature.  Like Leonardo da Vinci, he just studied a lot of things in nature and that's where he came up with some of his best ideas.  So I like to be around living things as much as possible.  When I'm in the house, at least I have plants and -- and a dog so there's some life there I ...
R:  Right. 
L:  And -- and, yeah, being around natural things really wakes me up a lot.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  It's just more refreshing.  You know, you're outside and then -- I think my favorite days are when -- when it's like not hot and not cold.  It's just that nice weather.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just even an outdoor activity, even though it's not exercise, you just sit outside and you can just listen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, when --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it's just the quiet and the birds and -- and I would even call that an activity just because it -- you know, as you said, it's the whole nature thing where you can relax and sometimes it's even -- like in the distance you [LAUGH] hear somebody mowing their lawn and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the smell of grass and all of that stuff is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like a pretty -- a pretty good activity also.  You know.
L:  You have a lot of birds around there?
R:  Yeah, a lot of birds.  We have a lot of critters and we probably put up a fence, we got the deer running through our yard too. 
L:  Huh.
R:  And you see bunnies and ground hogs and -- it's all kinds of stuff.  We're -- it -- it -- it -- that's, uh, you know.  We actually hit -- hit a deer, well, my mom hit a deer when [LAUGH] she was visiting.  Not fun but -- I had all the kids in the car but that's like [MN] I don't know.  I guess we were living [MN] rural here so you see more of that kind of thing and seems like everybody -- time[?] you turn around a -- a deer's hit, you know.  They just run out from ...  You know, it's kind of hazard but, um ...
L:  Mm.
R:  But the kids still get excited, you know, when a deer is sitting in your -- in your yard and it's very natural, the whole outdoors.  So I prefer there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] to -- to be outside.  Yeah.
L:  And you know I was just looking at something about, uh, being in a cage.  You know, [LAUGH] like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes our houses can feel like a cage.  [LAUGH] And --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, [LAUGH] you gotta get out.  
R:  That's how I feel too sometimes.  I look outside, I'm like, man, not [LAUGH] another day of rain.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the deer probably looking in the window going, "Oh, look at that poor [LAUGH] thing.  She's trapped in that cage".
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And they're all outside.  They don't care.  They're just, you know out in their little, [LIPSMACK] I don't know ...  So what -- what other things do you like to do out -- out -- outdoor?
L:  I like to walk a lot.  Um, there are a lot of really nice hiking trails in Seattle and, um, there's a lot of places to go skiing which is great.  Uh, but I -- I would be very happy just walking around.  There's water too, so walking along the beaches --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is really nice, and just hanging out.
R:  Yeah.  I miss that whole water thing.  We don't have water nearby.  You know you can't --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- really [MN] -- and that, I think, is the biggest part.  Because that's what we used to do is with the boats and the water skis and stuff and now here [LAUGH], you don't really have that opportunity.  I mean, they have [MN], I don't know, it's just not the same I guess.  You know what I mean.  Where --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um ...
L:  Where's the place that's close to water skiing out there?
R:  I don't even know.  Because you don't even hear of people doing it.  I mean, I --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- know there's like the regular -- the rivers are here.  Like the three rivers but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't really see too many people out there.  And I actually don't know where the closest place to go is.  You just don't hear of anybody doing it and ...
L:  Mm.  Have you ever water skied on a river?
R:  Not on a river, no.  We used to ski on the Delta.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that's where I get -- well, that's as close as you can get but no.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Not in a river.  Mostly in the big -- the lakes and -- and that.  
L:  Where'd you live in California?
R:  The Bay area.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So that was, um ...  [MN]  It's just a change.  Because this is snow.  You -- you don't get the snow and you get the snow here and ...
L:  Were you outside a lot more when you were in California?
R:  Oh, all the time.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah?
R:  You can go into summer, it's probably like, you know, fifty degrees at worst, you know and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you can go outside for all things and you're still grilling outside, and here you can't see the ground for months on end and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's just not seeming to want to end here so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  Well, San Francisco is a lot like Seattle as far as the weather outside and --
R:  Yeah, it was always cold.  Everytime we go to San Francisco make sure, you -- you know, bring a sweatshirt.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It was definitely --
L:  Yeah, but -- so you still found that you could do a lot of [NOISE] stuff outside even though it was ...
R:  Ye- yeah.  Because it's not like here.  Like here it -- this -- 'specially this past year.  It was snow on the ground from, I think, Thanksgiving all the way through.  And -- I -- I mean and it's still not warm.  I mean, it's warm.  We have some of our days here but the snow finally went away and then the rain comes and -- and then as soon as we all are done complaining that it's, [MN] you know, the -- the weather is bad it's gonna be scalding [LAUGH] hot, so ...  Yeah, I don't know, but ...
L:  So, what -- what percent, like, say your quality of life would you say is the fact that you can't do a lot of the same stuff you did in California?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I -- I think definitely we're inside more because of the weather here.  However, I guess you can turn that and say the outdoor activities are different because in the winter everybody can put their snow clothes on and go sledding. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And build snowmen.  And so you are outside but you're not outside as much because it's so cold that -- that you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- want to come back in faster, I guess.  And, um --
L:  And when you say cold.  What's the temperature?
R:  Oh, like freezing [LAUGH] temperatures.  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Like ...?
R:  Although, now we're probably hitting in the sixties so it's not particularly cold but it's June.  I mean, the pool's open and nobody's there because it's not hot, you know.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Um, so yesterday people flocked there because we actually hit eighty, but then today we're rainy and in the sixties again, so ...
L:  And your --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- kids probably don't know the difference.  [MN]  Have they always been in Pennsylvania?
R:  Um, the two older ones lived in California but they, um, they remember but they were probably too young.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- You know, so and, um --
L:  So they don't talk about it and miss it like their mom, huh?
R:  No.  No.  I -- it's just -- it's just us.  But, um ...  I have --
L:  What about your husband?  What does he do?
R:  He -- he runs.  He likes -- he's a runner so he likes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to, um, he's outside a lot and he's one of those, we're too, oh, it doesn't matter what the weather is.  
L:  Mm.
R:  He'll -- he'll just be out and go and he would run in the snow and he'll run in the -- in -- in the rain and -- and that's his thing so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  It doesn't really stop him as much, unless it's really bad and then he'll go run on the treadmill inside but he doesn't really -- not like that as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  So it sounds like for you the biggest thing is
