L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  This is --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- Tiffany.  I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Hi, Tiffany.  I'm Suzanne and I am in, well, north of Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, California.  [NOISE] Wow, that's far.
L:  California.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So, corporate scandal.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It makes me think about Martha Stewart.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's all it makes me think about.  [MN]  You know.  Did that affect your life?
R:  You know what?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I don't think it has.  You know, it -- it was funny 'cause this morning my husband said to me, "Well, is she still gonna sell her sheets?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause he likes the sheets.  And I said, well, I don't -- I don't -- I don't know, you know.  I -- but, you know, I kinda have to wonder if she really, you know, did say, hey, let me get out of here, or if she had the agreement.  They're saying that the [NOISE] document that solidifies -- that says that she would sell the stock if it got below sixty dollars was a fraud.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.  
L:  Yeah.  I [MN] -- you know what amazes me is that somebody that has that much money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wants more.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  You know, and they have to go to, you know, a -- an illegal means to get it.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Why --
R:  That's bad.
L:  It's like you and I robbing a bank.  
R:  Right.
L:  Is it worth --
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
L:  -- the risk?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  You can end up in jail [MN] ninety [LAUGH] percent of the time.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So ...
R:  You're right.  [NOISE]
L:  It's -- it's -- to me it's not worth it.  So I haven't robbed any banks.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  Even though, you know, the money would be great but why go through all the problem of doing something illegal that's going to jeopardize your freedom and your lifestyle.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  As far as, like, the government doing anything to stop it.  I don't, you know, people are gonna do what people are gonna do.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  There are laws in place and people still break them everyday.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it -- it's sad but what, you know what -- what more can the government do?  Impose tougher laws?  [NOISE]  People are just gonna be more careful about the things that they do.
L:  Yeah.  I don't see that -- that laws are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gonna really make any difference.  
R:  I don't either.
L:  I think what we have there in place is, you know, probably as good as it's gonna get.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think the more laws you create the more difficult the system becomes.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.
R:  And it gets all -- get all caught up in red tape and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Jargon and crap that, you know, the average person wouldn't even understand.
L:  That's right.
R:  But you know what it is?  It's -- it's money.  
L:  Greed.
R:  Greed.  Yeah, money makes people do things that they -- they wouldn't ordinarily do.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Once you get to a certain level where you're dealing with millions of dollars, people are gonna act totally different because once you've [NOISE] reached that level you don't ever want to go back.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  And, you know, she has so much money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's no chance she'll ever go back.  I mean, the lifestyle that she's created for herself, she -- number one she has too many homes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know, I mean, [MN] how bad can it get?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  Like the En- --
L:  She's never gonna end up living like me.  
R:  I know.
L:  You know, middle class.  
R:  Like the Enron people.  Like, you know, they -- they were buying all these extravagant things and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like you already have this wonderful lifestyle.  You -- you're already making, without stealing and without doing anything illegal, you're making an -- a seven [NOISE] an eight figure income.  Why would you go and jeopardize that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  By doing shady accounting?  That's, like -- that's -- that's ridiculous.  That's so greedy.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  
R:  When there are people who, you know, just can barely make ends meet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're not -- they're not doing anything illegal to stop that.  But these people who live really, really comfortable do --
L:  But that's --
R:  -- illegal stuff [MN] so they can get more.
L:  Yeah.  Gotta have more.  Gotta have more.  And I don't understand it, you know.  I don't even know -- does she have children?
R:  I don't know.  I would -- I [NOISE] would assume if she did they would be grown.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, adults, 'cause she's -- I mean, she's not old but she's not young.
L:  Right.  She's probably in her early fifties, don't you think?
R:  Yeah, I think somewhere around that.
L:  Yeah.  But I mean, you know, she's divorced.  Who she's gonna leave all this money too?  I mean, she's created this empire.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  It's almost like, I don't know if it's as big as Oprah Winfrey's but I can't see, you know ...
R:  She's a household name.
L:  She is.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, she's in K Mart.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]  She's in K Mart.
L:  Yeah.
R:  K Mart is everywhere.  I -- I don't care who you are.  You go to K- [NOISE] -- somebody goes to K- in your family.  Even if you, yourself, don't go.  Someone in your family goes to K Mart.  
L:  That's right.  Yeah.  
R:  So, I --I can't -- I can't imagine it.  And even --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if she did have kids, I mean, I would assume that by this time in her life, if her kids are that much older, they're probably set up.  You know what I mean?  Whereas --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't want for anything either.
L:  Yeah.  Either that or she is as bitchy as they tell us.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And she's basically told 'em you're not getting anything.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH]  It's going all to charities, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like Leona Helmsley[?] [MN] ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're not getting anything.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm gonna take it to my grave.  
L:  [LAUGH]  That's right.  
R:  That's the [LAUGH] ...
L:  Stuff my casket with money.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That wouldn't be funny.  That would be horrible 
L:  I know.  Somebody's probably done it.  
R:  I -- I -- you know what?  I wouldn't put it past someone.  I wouldn't put it past people.  There was some, uh [MN] +years -- years ago I watched something on television where this -- some guy was really rich and he died and his dying wish was to have his, um, Mausoleum made into the shape of a car.  
L:  Oh, God.
R:  And it cost his family, like, a hu- a hundred thousand [NOISE] dollars or something like that to have it done.  But they did it because that was, like, his dying wish.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he, you know, left behind enough money for them to do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it was beautiful but --
L:  So, you know ...
R:  -- why waste that much money when your family could've took it and, you know, done something with it?
L:  Well, I guess they didn't need it.  Or maybe they wouldn't have honored his wishes.  
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't know how you could dishonor somebody's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wish like that.  I mean, especially if it's within, you know, his --
R:  Means.
L:  -- means.  
R:  He set aside the money for it so ... 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If that's what he wants.  
L:  Well, I at le- I at least hope that his family, you know, wasn't destitute [NOISE] in any way. 
R:  Yeah.  I can't imagine.  I think you'd contest the Will, you know, and -- and go after his money if -- if the family really needed money.
L:  Right.  
R:  That's weird.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I just thought that was really weird.  It was on -- I can't remember what show it was on but it was really weird and I was like, wow.  
L:  People do really weird things when they want to, um, you know, decide where they want to go when they're dead.  [LAUGH]  My --
R:  Yeah, well, you can't take anything with you but your good deeds.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So [MN] try and build up on those.
L:  My, um, girlfriend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- her mother, she has, I think, five children.  What she wants to do is be cremated and then she wants to be put in Christmas -- clear Christmas bowls.  
R:  Are you serious?
L:  And so every year when you get her out, you know, all the kids would have 'em, and I think you'd, um, put her on the tree and then she could be there to enjoy Christmas with you.
R:  Wow.
L:  For eternity.  Is that weird?
R:  Yeah, that is --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- weird.  I mean, like, it -- it --
L:  Uh, who would come up with that?
R:  I know.  I -- I mean like it kinda [NOISE] sounds sentimental but then it kinda sounds kinda eerie.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At the same time.
L:  It's like, you know, you got this ball that's got --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like grey dust in it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  What do you tell people when they [LAUGH] come?
R:  That's weird.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've seen something where you can have -- if you have someone cremated you can have them -- the ashes compressed into some kind of stone.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I haven't seen that  
R:  Yeah, I seen it.  It -- but it's really expensive.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's really expensive.
L:  Huh.
R:  I -- I couldn't imagine it.  I just -- I -- I just don't think about things like that.  Like, you know, my parents aren't that old but, you know, I know one day -- like I'm the oldest so I know I'll have to be the one [NOISE] making all those decisions and I'm like, no, we're just all gonna die together because I'm not [LAUGH] gonna be able to [NOISE] --
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  -- make that --
L:  Uh, my mom died a few years ago and --
R:  Really?
L:  It was really difficult.  I was there with my dad.  And, uh, so we had to go through and do it all.  And, you know, my mom died of alzheimers.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, she -- but she was seventy four.  So she lived a long time with it.
R:  Yeah, she was [several inaudible words].
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] [COUGH] but my dad, you know, was kinda leaning toward, um, having her cremated.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she had told me, I don't know how many times, she didn't want to be cremated.  That fire scared her.
R:  Right.
L:  And I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- looked at him and I said, "You can't do that".  
R:  Right.  Yeah.  
L:  He said, "Why the hell not?"  And I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] said [LAUGH], "'Cause I'm here [LIPSMACK] and you know she didn't want that".  
R:  Right.  
L:  "Okay".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And he
