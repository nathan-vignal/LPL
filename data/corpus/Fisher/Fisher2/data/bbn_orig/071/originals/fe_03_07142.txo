L:  Hello.  Um, this is Ellie.  Is there somebody there?
R:  Yes.  I'm Alexandra.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi.  
L:  Alexandria.  That's -- that's --
R:  Alexandra -- 
L:  That's a pretty name.
R:  -- actually.  Thank you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Alexandra.  Okay.  Uh ...
R:  Hi.
L:  Alexandra, do you like indoor or outdoor [LAUGH] activities?
R:  I like outdoor activities.
L:  Uh-huh.  What --
R:  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  When the weather's warm.  [MN]
L:  Mhm.  
R:  I don't like to stay home.
L:  Well, I don't either.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, as a matter of fact I -- when the phone rang I was just in the process of slicing ov- -- open a bag of potting soil to put some wildflower, uh, seeds in my [MN] so called garden.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  That's what I was doing.  I especially like that kind of an outdoor activity.  If it isn't too hot or too cold.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's -- it's pretty good here today.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Boston.  Where are you from?
L:  Boston?  Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  We've been having a horrible weather. Horri- horrible summer so far.  So not much of outdoor activities for us yet.  It's been raining pretty much non stop.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Since early May.  
L:  I see.
R:  Very depressing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'll bet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember the east.  I lived in Ohio and Pennsylvania and sometimes it would rain or drizzle for a month in a row and that was pretty awful. 
R:  It is.
L:  [COUGH]  When you do go outside what kind of activities do you like to do?
R:  Well, I, uh, I like to run on the beach.
L:  Mm.
R:  I also -- I have a son so we -- my husband and I and my son we go, um, [LIPSMACK] we'll play soccer outside.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So we do that.  I'm trying to think.  Just, you know, walking on the beach is very nice.
L:  Oh, I bet.  I've [MN] really -- a- am not real familiar with the Atlantic Ocean.  I've been walking on the Pacific Ocean before --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- uh, several times but not the Atlantic.  So you live fairly close to the beach?
R:  We are a few minutes away.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  Um ...
L:  How nice. 
R:  Yeah, it's nice.
L:  Yeah.  Do you swim there ever?
R:  Uh, it's really dirty.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I would think, yeah.
R:  I don't.  A lot of people do but [MN] no, I don't take that chance.
L:  I know.  I -- I don't like [MN] sw- swimming in the ocean.  I've put my feet or ankles in it but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I don't really want to gut -- get beyond there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Plus I'm not much of a swimmer.  Are you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a swimmer?
L:  Oh, not a strong swimmer.  No, I just, uh, just barely.  [LAUGH]  I couldn't save myself or anybody else.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So what do you do beside gardening then?
L:  [inaudible].  I -- I walk.  I do a lot of walking and gardening and occasionally swimming at the pool, but I'm not too much for, um, [LIPSMACK] competitive activities and -- I'm older.  I'm fifty three so I ...
R:  Oh, that's old.  [LAUGH] I'm kidding, you. 
L:  It's old, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  No, you're not old.
L:  Uh, well, sort of [MN] -- my arthritis will bother me from time to time but I -- I do get out and walk everyday.  Uh, just about everyday [MN] i- if the weather's good.  And, um, I just -- I'm a fresh air kind of person.  I -- even though I live in -- in an apartment I'm -- I guess my heart is in the country.  I live right across the street from a beautiful park and I always leave my windows open and I can hear the geese --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh.
L:  -- from my, uh, uh -- from my home and [MN] actually see them so I -- although I live in the city it's -- it's kind of country out here.  It's -- it's really nice.  
R:  How's the weather in Oklahoma?  Is it mild?
L:  Uh [SIGH].  It's -- well they say it can change at any time.  If you don't like it, it -- the -- the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- summer's are hot and uncomfortable.  Uh, some -- well, somewhat humid but that -- humid -- but that is relative I guess.  If you lived in Boston you would say, no, this is not a humid summer.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I've come from Las Vegas so, um, it's humid enough and it's -- I -- see, I think the only thing I don't like is the ice and the cold.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  So it gets pretty cold then?  [several inaudible words].
L:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK]  It doesn't really get down to zero.  It gets down to freezing and maybe --
R:  Oh, so enough to --
L:  -- in the teens. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Enough to snow, yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, uh, do you like any, uh -- they asked us to talk about --
R:  Winter activities?
L:  Ye- -- I guess.  
R:  Did they?
L:  Did they say -- did they say hot water --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- or cold water activities?  I didn't --
R:  I [several inaudible words].
L:  -- quite understand that.
R:  H- hot or cold weather.
L:  Weather?  Oh.
R:  Yes.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's what I thought.
L:  And which do you prefer?
R:  Well, I don't like hot or cold.
L:  Mm.  
R:  I don't -- I thought I might like skiing but I'm just too cold.  I don't get excited.  In fact, I was just thinking about it.  It's really time for [LAUGH] me to move --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- somewhere else.  For us all to move somewhere else because I'm not a cold -- I'm not a cold weather person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I do like to spend time outdoors and I just -- I think I'll be better off living somewhere in a warmer climate.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I spend so much time indoors.
L:  Oh, I understand.
R:  Inactive, really, on the couch.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  When I could be out there being more active.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.
R:  If the weather permitted me --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do so.  So, no, I don't like -- I'm not -- I a s- -- I don't like skiing or any -- any of that.
L:  Me neither.  I -- I mean, I -- if it's mild, again, I'd walk and that'd be about it.  And -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe once a year go snow, uh, not snow skiing but sledding.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But certainly not serious sledding, just fun, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, yeah, cold -- cold weather I -- I don't like the cold too much.  [LIPSMACK]  And I come from a hot -- well, I've done both.  I've lived where it's colder and where it's a lot hotter, and where I love now is in between and it's -- it's preferred.  [LAUGH] 
R:  How was the climate in Las Vegas?  Was it --
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  -- too hot?
L:  Well, yeah, the summer's from June until the middle -- end of September is very hot.  You know, y- you have days of a -- most of the time it tops a hundred.  As they say, it's a dry heat.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um, but the rest of the year -- I mean, you have some cold days and so on but the weather is good for eight months of the year, so I like that.  I liked the weather there, sort of.  But I -- I like this better.  In spite of the snow I -- and the ice, I like to see the seasons --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- change more dramatically.  You see it in Las Vegas but you don't see it like you do here.  
R:  Did you feel that in the summer in Las Vegas, wou- would you not go outside?  W- was it uncomfortable, let's say, to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- walk?  Was it --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that hot?
L:  Unless you're extremely fit.  Summertime in Las Vegas is probably like wintertime in Boston.  It's the kind of thing you don't want to get out --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and just do things, you know, except what you have to do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  And go from one air conditioned area to the other or wait until the evening.
R:  [MN] 
L:  It's hot [several inaudible words].
R:  Is [MN] Arizona the same way?
L:  Yeah.  Ariz- -- I lived in Phoenix, Arizona, twenty one years ago and it's even hotter than Las Vegas.
R:  Really?
L:  It's more humid.  A bit more humid.  And, uh, uh, personally I did not -- it was -- it was too hot there.  It was even hotter than Las Vegas.  It was a different -- it was just -- just about the hottest [LAUGH] place you can live.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I'm [MN] -- I'm just thinking, my husband I were actually discussing, because we like to be outside because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we like, you know, w- we're [MN] both thinking about different places in U.S. and where we can [LAUGH] relocate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's so hard.  Because unless you live there you really don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- it's -- so I'm glad that I [LAUGH] got the [inaudible] from you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So now I know not to go to Arizona.  'Cause it looked -- it looked good.  Especially --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's no pollen and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and things like that.  And there's no +hard cold winter but I did -- I knew summer's were hot.  I didn't reali- -- I thought that since they're dry summers maybe they're not as hard to, [LIPSMACK] um --
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, you know, hot and a person [MN] -- the summer's here, because they get hot and [MN] humid and it's just impossible sometimes to breathe.
L:  I guess it would be a matter of perception.  You might talk to someone else and get more opinions than my own but I -- that's just my [LAUGH] opinion.  
R:  Well, I guess, when it gets to a hundred and ten [LAUGH] it -- it is, I guess it is kind of [LAUGH] hot.  
L:  You know, the difference between a hundred and a hundred and ten.  I mean, there's obviously a difference but it's miserable --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] one is about the same.  It feels about the same.  So ...
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, yeah, I just -- oh, let's see.  Indoor, outdoor activities.  What else are we supposed to talk [LAUGH] about?
R:  It's -- it's [LAUGH] it's hard.  This is my second call.
L:  This is mine too.  My second call.
R:  Yeah, i- it's like okay.  We talk about it for three minutes and [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like ...  I like biking.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Although we don't get to really -- it's -- it's sort of an event to go biking.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Specially with a kid.  We can't just -- we need to go to a place where there are no cars so it's like you have to --
L:  Bicycling, you mean?  Is that what ...?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  Yes.  Bicycling.  [LIPSMACK]  And it's kind of hard because you have to, um, stick the bike -- put the bicycles on the [LAUGH] car and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you get them off so ...  More often that not we sort of forego biking for something else.  
L:  Well, biking sounds wonderful but I'm a bit of a coward of getting hurt and falling and things like that.  That seems odd but I -- I take very little risks physically.  I think, I -- otherwise I'm -- I'm a risk taking person in other areas of my life somewhat.  But the -- like the actual -- like falling down and getting hurt or risking myself like that, I just -- even biking is too [LAUGH] scary for me.  
R:  Even if it's a [MN] isolated area --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- with no cars?
L:  I tell you, I think my fear there is I didn't learn to ride a bicycle until I was twenty two.
R:  Okay.  
L:  That's why.
R:  [MN]
L:  I missed that piece when I was a kid and then never tried it, and then one day I -- I learned and I haven't been on a bike for a long time but, yeah, I -- I'm sure it's a wonderful feeling to just get in [MN] on a road where it's safe and just ride.  
R:  It -- it -- it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nice.  In fact I would never
