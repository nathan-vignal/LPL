L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.  
R:  Who is this?
L:  Hello.  My name is Karen and I'm in Minneapolis.  Who's this?
R:  This is Usha[?] and I'm in Pennsylvania.  
L:  Okay.  You sound young.  Are you -- are -- how old are you?
R:  Ten.  
L:  I thought you sounded like you were young.  
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm fifty two.  So I'm -- I'm a lot older than you.  And -- what was your name again?  Usha?
R:  Yes.  
L:  That's a nice name.
R:  Thank you.  What was yours again?
L:  Karen.  
R:  Karen?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's a lovely name.
L:  Thank you.  So, Usha, I guess we're supposed to talk about, um, activities and, um, I don't know if you heard what -- what the, um, recording said but I guess we're supposed to -- first off, talk about do we like, um, indoor or +outdoor -- outdoor activities better.  
R:  Or --
L:  What about you?
R:  -- hot weather or warm, uh, weather.
L:  Oh, that's right.  That's right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, what about you?
R:  I think I like warm weather better because hot weather, it's too hot and I wish it was, um, winter but --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- warm weather --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just nice and right for me.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I like outdoor activities better because you get more experience with the world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Instead of staying in your house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  That -- actually that's really true.  Well, I -- I really hate the -- the hot weather.  I'm just like the worst when the weather's hot, so I don't do any activities when it's like ninety degrees 'cause I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I've just gotten to be a real weather wimp and I have a -- a dog named Winston and since I got Winston it -- I have to walk her twice a day.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And, um, I actually have found that I like [MN], uh, being outside in the winter better.  Um --
R:  I have a dog named Chip.
L:  Do ya?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have to walk your dog or do they just ...?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Uh, what kind of dog is it?
R:  A terr- a terrimutt.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  Good.  Winston's a mutt too.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's the best kind.  If you ask me.  Um, [LIPSMACK] so what I've found out from having a dog is that I actually don't mind the winter too bad.  I used to hate it.  I used to, um, just do as little as I could outside in the wintertime but now I kinda like it.  And, um, I notice that, like, there's a lot of variation, you know, in the cold and in the snow and, um, so I'm like you though, I like -- I like it when it's warm the best.  And I like it when it's slightly cool the -- the second best, and I like it when it's really cold the third best, and I like it when it's hot the very least.
R:  Yeah.  Because when I walk my dog I like to do it in warm weather --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- because if it's really, really hot they'll keep stopping in the shade and you'll never get around the block.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Isn't that the truth?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is really true.  So what else do you like to do outside?
R:  Um, play sport. 
L:  Uh-huh.  What kind?
R:  Football, soccer.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you?
R:  Basketball, baseball.
L:  Wow, you do.  You do like to play ball.  
R:  I love it.
L:  Do ya?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not very good at ball games.  I like to do, um, things just, like, by myself like biking or, um, walking.
R:  My --
L:  I like to walk a lot.
R:  [LAUGH]  My favorite things are drawing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- outside.  Drawing, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the trees when it's nice and warm outside.  
L:  Really?
R:  And also playing my trumpet.
L:  Really?  
R:  [LAUGH]  Mhm.
L:  Huh.  That's interesting.  Huh.  I like to read.  I like to read outside.  I like to --
R:  I know.
L:  -- read inside too but [LIPSMACK] that's my favorite thing to do.  Of all things.  I like to read the best.  
R:  I do too.
L:  So I do that -- do ya?
R:  Yeah, I love to read.  
L:  Me too.
R:  I just got done reading a fifty chapter book.
L:  [MN]  You're kidding?  What?
R:  Holes.
L:  What is it?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What is it?
R:  Holes.
L:  What?
R:  Holes.  
L:  Who's it -- who wrote it?
R:  I forget.  
L:  Uh-huh.  That sounds very ambitious.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But don't you love, in reading, don't you love the way it, like, takes you to, like --
R:  It --
L:  -- a place you've never been before.
R:  It feels like you're actually in the book.
L:  What?
R:  It feels like you're actually in the book.
L:  Doesn't it?  It really does.
R:  Because it gives you a lot of information and details.
L:  Yeah.  It really does.  You know when I was your age I used to love to, um, read the Wizard of Oz books.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Although maybe when I was a little younger than you.  But do you like those books?
R:  Yeah.  I love those.
L:  Aren't they good?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those are really good summer books.  I think.  Um, so are you out of school yet?
R:  No.  I get out next -- I get out on the sixteenth.
L:  Oh.  Boy, that's kind of late, isn't it?  
R:  Yeah.  'Cause we had to add extra days on [inaudible] of the snowy weather.
L:  Oh.  'Cause you had so much snow this year.  We had almost no snow in Minnesota.
R:  [MN]
L:  And that's really unusual for us.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  We have a lot of snow.  
L:  Yeah.  You know, I watched the weatherman, and Pennsylvania did have a lot of snow.  
R:  I think we have, like, a fo- -- um, I think we had two feet one time.
L:  Wow.  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Becau- -- it just snowed like three days in a row.
L:  Wow.
R:  And it was actually two feet we had to walk in. 
L:  Wow, that's so cool.  Did you like it?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I bet.  Did you have to shovel it?  
R:  Yeah, a lot.  
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Every day.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  'Til my mom finally bought salt.
L:  Yes.  To put down?
R:  [several inaudible words].  Mhm. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But once she put -- and since it was so much snow, once she put down the salt it melted --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was like a whole flood.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, really?  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, gee.  How 'bout that?
R:  What kind of house do you live in?
L:  I live in a three bedroom house.  It's all on one floor and it was built in nineteen sixty three.  And it's got stucco on the outside and hardwood floors on the inside and, uh, what about you?
R:  I live in a, um, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, um, eight -- I live in about eight, nine bedroom house.
L:  Good grief.  That sounds like a mansion.  That sounds huge.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is it a really big house?
R:  Yeah.  Huge.
L:  God, yes.  Wow.  Is it a farmhouse or is it a ...?
R:  It's -- it's a, um, rock house.  
L:  A what?
R:  A rock house.  Built of rocks.
L:  You're kidding?  That sounds so cool.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Congratulations.  
R:  Thank you.
L:  I wish I lived in your -- I'll trade -- I'll trade houses with you anytime.  You just let --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- me know.  
R:  Do you think -- would you say your house is like a outdoor house or a indoor house?
L:  [LAUGH]  It's definitely an indoor house.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  It's definitely the indoors.  What about yours?
R:  [MN]  I'd say it's like inbetween 'cause it has huge windows.  
L:  [MN]  Your --
R:  I have --

R:  Yeah.  And we have to clean it.  
L:  Oh.

R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I had to stop to, uh, talk to you and it's been so pleasant to do that.  It's been really nice to talk to you.
R:  Really nice to talk to you too.
L:  Well, thank you.  I guess we've probably got a few more minutes.  They're gonna let us know when we're done.  But how did you, uh, hear about the -- doing this, uh, phone calling thing.
R:  Well, the phone just rang.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I picked it up and gave me information and I was like, "Hm, never heard this before, sounds interesting --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- talking to another person on the phone".
L:  Yeah.  That's really neat.  That is really good.  I'm -- I'm so -- I'm so pleased.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So let's see.  What else shall we talk about, about activities?  Um, do you like to ride bikes?
R:  I love riding bikes.
