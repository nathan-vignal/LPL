L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hell- --
L:  My name's Cody.
R:  My name's Rachana[?].
L:  How are you doing, Rachana? [NOISE]
R:  I'm fine.
L:  [NOISE] You like summer or winter the best?
R:  Um, actually I like -- oh, God.  I like the summer the best, but I don't like to be cold either.  You know what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm definitely a summer person.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where do you live at?
R:  I live, actually, in North Carolina.
L:  North Carolina?
R:  Mhm.  What about you?
L:  I live in Oklahoma.
R:  Oh.  Okay, now you may have to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You may have to help me.  Is it cold or warm over there?
L:  It's pretty nice.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Pretty nice.  Actually, we're having unseasonably cold weather.
R:  Really?  We're having --
L:  It's in the eighties.
R:  Mhm.  We're having rainy. [LAUGH]
L:  You getting some rain?  Well, it's --
R:  Yeah, lots of rain.
L:  -- always good to get rain --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this time of year.
R:  I don't know, it's just as bad to get too much rain, you know.
L:  Yeah, I betcha -- do y'all have that problem there?
R:  Yes, a lot. [NOISE] Flooding.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.  So, do you like being outside or inside?
L:  I'm an outside person.  I live on the lake --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I do a lot of fishing, hunting.
R:  Ooh, I love fishing. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But me it's more of a pond type fishing instead of, you know -- I've always wanted to go out on a boat or on a pier to fish but haven't had the privilege yet.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  No.
L:  I won- -- I wondered if you live close to the ocean?
R:  Actually, no.  Um, [NOISE] I'm not quite sure how far we are from, like, the coasts or anything.  Um, I presently work at a hotel and everyone asks me, "Okay, how far are we from the cro- coast?" and I have to tell 'em, "Oh, Lord, I don't know".  So, I'm guessing I have to update myself on the more outdoorsy type things. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, [inaudible] to the ocean.
R:  Mm.
L:  I really do.  I love seafood.  I bet you get some good seafood down there, too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Um, I used to do some crabbing when I was younger.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, with my grandmother.  Don't ask me what we used to do 'cause I have no clue, but, um, I do remember she had, like, baskets they put down.  I was really young but I rem- -- I used to remember our Saturday trips in Atlantic City.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Crab.  And I bet that -- that's a story to tell your grandkids --
R:  Oh, yeah
L:  -- there.
R:  It was some fun. [LAUGH]
L:  I bet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I bet.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, right now, the last couple of days I've been fishing.  I am fishing all day long and -- and it's just because the weather's been unseasonably cool.
R:  Oh, okay.  And what did --
L:  In the eighties.  Go ahead.
R:  What did you say your name was?
L:  Cody.
R:  Cody?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, 'cause I think I was trying to talk as you were saying it, so [LAUGH] I kinda missed it.
L:  Well, I apologize.
R:  No, that's my fault.
L:  I apologize.
R:  [SIGH] I'm a newy at this, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  This is actually --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my first call.
L:  Um, this is my fourth call.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Fourth call.  But, yeah, it's, uh -- I'll take 'em any time they wanna give me ten dollars for talking --
R:  Mhm, oh, yeah.
L:  -- on the phone, I'll do it.
R:  Hey, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  I had to turn down my first one.  I was actually on my way out the door.  I'm usually, um, available at this time but it was something going on that day so [SIGH].
L:  What do you do outside other than go crabbing?
R:  Um, well, I have three boys so we actually have a tent outside in our backyard and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you're a camper?
R:  Actually, no, but, um, I let my boys handle all that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I haven't -- well, I -- [MN] when I was in girl scouts, younger, um, I did do a camping trip but I think that was the only camping trip I've ever been on.  I wouldn't mind going, you know, but [SIGH] ...
L:  I bet it would be pretty country in North Carolina.
R:  It is, believe me. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sure it is.
R:  As I said, you -- you can put your tent in the backyard and feel like you're camping.  It's pretty country. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Y'all have a lot of pine trees?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I wondered.  I thought -- I thought you did but I wasn't for certain.
R:  Mhm, yeah, there's a lot of pine trees.  Um, and pecan trees.  You'll find a lot of pecan trees.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Mhm.
L:  We call that pecans here.
R:  Mhm.  I'm sorry?
L:  I've heard it called pecans and I think pecans is the correct way of saying it.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But everybody in Oklahoma calls it pecans.
R:  Pecans [LAUGH].
L:  [inaudible].
R:  I haven't [inaudible] -- that's crazy because, um, I think ... I don't know, I'm originally from Philadelphia, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- I've actually had to rearrange my dialect when I [LAUGH] moved here.  And now I just sound like old country girl been here since eighty nine.  I love it.
L:  Well, I'm definitely a hick from Oklahoma.  Everywhere I go, the first thing they say is, "Where are you from?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Oklahoma?"  And I say, "Well, how'd you know?"
R:  [LAUGH] It's the accent, the twang. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess so.  I guess so.
R:  Well, this is -- North Carolina would be a great place for an outdoor person because it's just so open, you know.
L:  Really?
R:  Right.  You have to drive thirty miles just to get to the store, you know, things [LAUGH] like that.
L:  What's the temperature there now?
R:  Really?  I didn't hear you?
L:  What's the temperature?
R:  Um, now, oh, God, I think, if I'm not mistaken, it's around the eighties, but it's muggy 'cause it has been raining tremendously.
L:  So the humidity's high?
R:  Yes.  Um, yesterday I think it rained completely all day.  On my way to work I had to, um -- we -- everybody had their flashers on 'cause it was so much rain.  And it was four o'clock during the day.  You could see nothing.  So ...
L:  Really?
R:  Mm.
L:  How much rain do y'all get?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I haven't found that out yet, but [LAUGH] I know we've had a lot of flash flood warnings yesterday.
L:  Really?
R:  Right.
L:  That's probably make world news tonight.
R:  Mhm.  We're good for that now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So, you work in a hotel?
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  Do you do any outside activities at the hotel?
R:  Um, no. [LAUGH] No, because, um, I'm a basically front desk, so I'm behind the desk all day.  And the only outdoor activities is going into the hotel and coming out. [LAUGH]
L:  I've been gardening today outside.
R:  Now, I do want to get into some gardening.
L:  Well --
R:  Um --
L:  -- we're not growing vegetables but, um, fruit --
R:  I said I wanted to plant some flowers.
L:  Oh, that's what we were doing --
R:  Yeah, that's what I want --
L:  -- Rachana, that would have been right up your alley.
R:  Mhm.  I said I wanna plant some flowers around my house, but actually I want to move into another house before I do it.  Um, I don't like this [inaudible], there's not really anywhere to put flowers, and I've been out looking at houses and I found one with plenty of yard for my babies to play out- outside.  And they love the outdoors, especially my two year old.
L:  Oh, I bet.
R:  Uh-huh.  I have to fight 'em in order to get 'em in the house after we've been outside.  And my boys, they're the peculiar -- peculiar type.  They like to go looking for stuff, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  How 'bout when you were a kid, did you like the outdoors as well?
L:  Oh, um, we lived on a farm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sixty acres.
R:  Sixty acres.
L:  And we weren't allowed to come inside unless it was raining.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] Mom wanted us out of the house.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, yeah, I walked around barefoot [inaudible] everywhere and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bicycling or motorcycle riding or swimming or swinging --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- or --
R:  Well, may I ask how old you are so I know about [MN] --
L:  I'm thirty two.  How old are you, Rachana?
R:  Okay, I'm actually twenty five.
L:  Twenty five.
R:  Twenty five.  And my childhood was basically catching lightning bugs, you know.  That's the big thing that my children is actually starting now so I'm out there with them, [SIGH] you know, catching lightning bugs.  And it kinda takes you back to what you used to do when you were younger.
L:  I caught my fair share of lightning bugs.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And put 'em in a jar by my bed --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and watched 'em all night.
R:  Mhm.  And mine, uh, actually, one tends to get out every time.  At least one, and then they --
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm, does.  "Mommy, the lightning bugs is lightning in the house". [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Now, don't get me wrong, [SIGH] I know I said I love the summer and I love the outdoors, but I do enjoy the winter as well, certain -- for certain things, you know.  Um, if I could get back to ice skating, I would.  I've done that once or twice in my life and enjoyed it.
L:  Well, in Philadelphia you had some winters, didn't ya?
R:  Right.  And we, um, you know, actually we did our own ice skating on our feet. [LAUGH] Where my grand- --
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.  Where my grandmother lived, um, it was like a slight hill and we never waited for the snow or the, you know, the sled.  We always was used to ice on our, um, [COUGH] excuse me, ice skate on our feet and then slide and then land on our bottoms. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And slide the rest of the way down the hill.  Everybody had frostbite in the morning. [LAUGH]
L:  Sounds like a lot of fun.
R:  Yeah, plenty of fun, except for the following morning. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but I do --
L:  I --
R:  [SIGH] Mhm?
L:  I've done my fair share of sledding.
R:  [LAUGH] You say sweating?
L:  Sledding.
R:  Sledding, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Sledding, yeah.  We used to --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- tie inner tube behind a -- a car or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and pull it all over the place.
R:  [SIGH] Mm. [SIGH] My, um, first sled was a -- oh, God, is it Red Wing?  No.  I can't --
L:  Now, I had one of those.
R:  Uh, is it Red Wing?  And --
L:  Yeah, it's Red Wing.
R:  -- had little, um, steering mechanism on the front. [LAUGH]
L:  The steering, the [inaudible] board that you turned.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it sorta turns but it really doesn't.
R:  Right.  And then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the one that you control with your feet.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you push it to go the way that you wanna go, but it goes wherever it wants to go. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And you just hope that this is not a tree coming. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I've hit my fair share of trees.
R:  Those too, yes, very much.  That's the excitement about it. [LAUGH] Trying to dodge --
L:  Y'all have snow -- whoops, I'm sorry.
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  You -- do you have snow in North Carolina?
R:  Not as much as I would like to have.  Um, we basically end up with, like, ice storms and --
L:  Oh, man, that's worse.
R:  Or if it snows it's a tremendous amount of sow- snow that just puts the whole --
