L:  Katina.
R:  Jane.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  I'm -- I'm on -- I'm on my cellphone so can you hear me?
R:  Yes, I can.
L:  Okay.  What's your name?
R:  But the other day my -- my name's Jane.
L:  Oh, Jane.  Okay, I'm Katina.  Most people just call --
R:  Is this the first --
L:  This is -- yeah, this is my first time, um, having a conversation.  How 'bout you?
R:  Yeah, me too.  Me too.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, 'cause normally they've -- they've called me and I've missed the call so this is my first time.  I'm not [MN] exactly sure what all we have to do.  I know she said the topic was, uh, if we like cold weather or warm weather and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- something about indoor or out -- indoor versus outdoor activities, I think she said.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, what about you?  What -- where do you live?
R:  I live in Minneapolis.
L:  Minne- -- okay.  So pretty much you're a cold weather person.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I --I mean, whether by choice or not.  I mean, Minneapolis, geez.  See, I -- I live in Texas.
R:  But it gets really, you know -- it gets very --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- hot here in the summer.  A lot of people --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- think it's cold, you know ...  It gets in the eighties or even the nineties in the summer.  
L:  Wow.  Now see, I did not --
R:  So ...
L:  -- know that.  I just thought it was --
R:  I know.
L:  -- cold year round.  I figured you guys always had snow.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  No.
L:  [MN]  Well, I live in Houston, Texas, so it's, uh, it's always hot here.  Even when it's, uh, cold, it's really hot.  Like for Christmas last year it was like seventy two degrees on Christmas Day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's pretty much a, you know, you -- you -- you're warm pretty much year round.  Even on our coldest times we get to maybe the forties.  But we never --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get like freezing or whatever so ...  So I'm pretty much a, um, a warm weather person.  I like warm weather.  I don't really like, uh, being cold.  I travelled --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to Washington once and I was not prepared for that cold weather.  I didn't pack the --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- right clothing 'cause we don't have that kind of weather here in Texas, so it's kinda hard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to prepare for the unexpected.  So ...
R:  Have you lived there your whole life?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was actually -- I was born in Galveston and then, uh, we moved to Houston when I was above twelve, so I've -- I've been in Texas.  That's -- that's all I know really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I've travelled to a few cold places but nowhere that I could say, "Oh, hey, you know, I c- I could live +here even though its cold".  I -- I can't see myself saying that.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm like, no, it's gotta be warm or it's not gonna happen for me.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And because of that --
R:  What kind of activities do you like to do?
L:  Well, um, I actually -- this is a little bit odd.  Um, I enjoy sign language.  Um, I'm part of sign language group at my church and so that's like a big thing that we do.  I enjoy sign language and dancing.  So those are like --
R:  Uh.
L:  Those are like my, I guess, activities.  I'm not a big sports fan and it's hard to believe because in Texas everybody loves football.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's like the national pastime of the state.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I mean, you know, I watch it.  I'm just not a big participator of it so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I'll go to the games occasionally if it's free tickets or something like that, but otherwise I'm not really, um, a sports fan per se.  Um ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a s- I have a seven year old son and he played soccer last year for the first time so that was kinda neat.  I mean, it was nice to be able to go and -- and watch him, but if it wasn't for him playing I definitely would not have been at --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a soccer match.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just not my thing, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  So, what about you?  Do you -- what kind of sports do you like?
R:  Well, [SIGH] um, you know, as for what I actually do.  I don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- do much stuff anymore.  You know what I mean?
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  I'm thirty nine and, you know, I'm -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't exercise the way I should and I admit that.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I like to play basketball but, you know, I haven't done it in, like, twelve [LAUGH] years so ...
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
R:  I guess I don't like it that much, you know what I [LAUGH] mean?
L:  Okay.  So, yeah, you liked it at one time, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, w- which, you know, when we grew up we had a -- a goal out in our yard and so we played basketball outside but, you know, obviously, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when they play games they play inside.  So I guess that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- counts as both an inside and a outside activity.  [MN]  And, um, I like to walk but I have a lot of feet problems and I've --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- had surgery on my foot and so my doctor told me, you know, I shouldn't really walk but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I, um, I used to get up in the morning and walk four miles before I went to work and -- and I'd enjoy that a lot.  I liked -- you know, even --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- though it was cold up here I'm -- you know, it's like nineteen degrees [LAUGH] and [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  I mean [LAUGH] for someone like you, you probably can't imagine it but ...
L:  Oh, I can't -- I can't imagine what nineteen degrees --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- would feel like.  I -- I can't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- imagine going outside on purpose in nineteen degree --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- weather.  Just, oh, no.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  And, uh, and --
L:  Geez.
R:  -- I -- I live in downtown Minneapolis so I just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- walk downtown and then I'd walk around the Mississippi river and -- and back and forth and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I'd do that before I went to work and -- and then I started having a lot of feet problems and my --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- doctor told me I had to stop.  So -- so I would --
L:  What was it [MN] --
R:  -- say I like to walk but I don't, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't do it like I used to.  
L:  Geez.  Now, up there.  I'm gonna ask a s- -- I've never been to Minneapolis.  Like down here in Texas we have a lot of, um, obese children.  We have a lot of obese people and like everybody -- people were doing surveys and studies and stuff.  Well, it's the weather because people -- it's so hot people don't want to really exercise.  And ...  Do you guys have the reverse problem up there?  Do people not want to exercise because it's so cold?
R:  Well, [MN] I mean, there are a lot of -- people that live up here -- a lot of people, you know, they take pride in the fact that the weather doesn't slow them down.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I mean, I don't know if you've ever heard of ice fishing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But like people go out, you know, and it's super cold and all the lakes and ponds are frozen, and they drill a hole in the ice and then they fish, even though everything's frozen.  
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  You know.  Now, I mean, I don't like fishing anyway --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so being cold and fishing [LAUGH] sounds even less --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- appealing to me.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you know what I mean?  Or --
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  -- snowmobiling.  Or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, how cities have fairs and they have carnivals?
L:  Right.
R:  Well, the one up here is held in January.
L:  Mm.
R:  Like j- just to show, you know -- I mean, it's outside and it doesn't matter what the temperature is, it's an outside carnival in January, you know.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Just [LAUGH] you know.
L:  [inaudible], yeah.  
R:  Just to show --
L:  I can't even imagine that.
R:  -- that we're tough and -- and we do things.  They're like on New Year's Eve, you know, and no matter what the temperature is under your [inaudible], there's all kind of outside concerts and -- and stuff like that.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's just like anything else.  'Cause I've lived all over the world and I've lived where it's hot and I've lived where it's cold and I've --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lived in Hawaii and -- and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- you know, you just -- you adapt to wherever you live and so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, if you go outside and it's nineteen degrees, well you wear long underwear and you wear a scarf and a hat and gloves and a long coat and --
L:  And you go --
R:  You know.
L:  -- walking.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Wow.
R:  You know.
L:  See -- yeah.  
R:  And you buy hot chocolate.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and -- and you stay warm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah that -- that would take a lot of getting used to for me.  I mean, over here when it's in the forties I'm thinking, do I really want to go to work today?  It's really cold and ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I mean, just waking up in the morning is like a big deal because it's so cold.  But -- but that's for me.  That's -- forty degrees for me is really cold.  And occasionally they -- they'll tell you, okay, well wrap your pipes and your plants because it might freeze tonight.  We might get to twenty.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, so when that happens I'm like, oh, I really have to debate if I'm gonna get up in the morning but ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean that -- that's about as cold as we get and that's normally at night.
R:  And see up here at the end of winter, you know, if it's forty degrees at the end of winter when spring starts coming, we're wearing shorts and t shirts and have our windows open.  Because --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  You know, because everything's relative and if you've --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have temperatures a lot colder than that then that seems a lot warmer.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I remember one year, the first day I laid out, like, in a bathing suit --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- was in February and it was like forty five [LAUGH] degrees.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  You know.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  But then on the other hand after we'd had a hot summer and it's been in the eighties all the time, well, yeah, then when fall comes and it gets to f- gets to forty, well, then we think it's cold too.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because we've had it ...  You know, so everything's relative.  It just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- depends on what you're used to and once you --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- get used to it being hot well then, yeah, forty degrees seems cold.  And at the end of the winter forty degrees seems really warm.  
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  It's j- -- yeah, it is about where you live.  Now I know if I had to move somewhere I would definitely look for a place to move that was warm.  Temperature plays a big part in where I would live.  I just can't -- but that's because I was raised in a warm climate.  I've always been in a warm climate, so for me to make a big transition to another city or another state it'd have to be somewhere that's relatively warm year round.
R:  Yeah, see --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I like to have seasons.
L:  Okay.
R:  I like, you know, like when I lived in Hawaii that really --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- bothered me.  I like having my four distinct seasons.  I like to see the leaves fall off the trees and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I l- I love fall.  And I love winter.  And then I love everything coming back in spring and, you know, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I -- I -- it really bothered me in Hawaii.  It just seemed so abnormal to me, you know, to go get my Christmas tree and we're wearing shorts and sandals and have --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the air conditioner on in our vehicle.  And it's just, like, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this isn't right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now see that, that would not bother me whatsoever.  I'd be like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- oh, this is our best Christmas.  It's wonderful.  I know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I remember when I was younger.  We were -- we were learning to sing, uh, White Christmas and we were learning to sing it through the verse and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the verse was, uh, it kept saying, "The sun is shining, the grass is green, the orange palm trees sway".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it said "There's never been such a day in Beverley Hills, L.A."
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But it's December the twenty fourth.  I'm like, yeah, see that's my kind of Christmas Eve, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  I can deal with that kind of thing.  I'm not -- everyone that wants to sing White Christmas because if we ever get a white Christmas here I would freak out.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.  
R:  My friends from up north say that if we got a white Christmas
