R:  Schmila[?] Khan.
L:  Hi, Sophie from California.
R:  [NOISE] Hello, what?
L:  Um, this is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Sophie from California.
R:  [NOISE] Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm quite good.  How are you?
L:  Good, I'm doing -- I didn't, er, get which state are you in?
R:  Uh, oh, wait, can you repeat the question?
L:  Um, I didn't hear which state are you in?
R:  Uh, which interested am I in?
L:  No, which state do you live in?
R:  Oh, I'm sorry, I live in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, Pennsylvania, okay.  Okay.  Um, well, as far as the topic of the day, I live in California and most of the time we have sunny weather and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I just really like the outdoor activities due to the sun.  Um, most of the time I spend -- if I have time I spend, uh, that at the beach and doing the outside activities.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, you know, group activities, hiking, bikings and stuff.
R:  [NOISE] No, I hear ya.
L:  Okay, so ...
R:  [NOISE] So, where --
L:  Can --
R:  Are -- are you asking me which one I prefer?
L:  Um, yeah, de- -- because there was three things that they highlighted was, um, you know, if you live in the hot or cold weather, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you rather indoor or outdoor and which activities do you prefer?
R:  [NOISE] Um, well, actually recently -- recently Pennsylvania has been cold weather.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] We've -- we've been having a ser- -- we've been having, like, a two month series of rain here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in which it rains just about every single day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's about the most -- it's just about the most, uh, depressing thing that I've experienced in quite a long time.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] And so I would say I definitely am -- uh, prefer indoor activities as of late.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] As not only the weather outside, like, dictates that indoor ac- activities are better.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] But also with the fact that I think generally I prefer indoor activities because it's kind of like a safe haven slash bubble --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that you're inside of that you can kind of get away with a lot more in.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yes.
L:  Huh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, usually [MN] in Pennsylvania it's four season, isn't it?  You guys have this, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, spring, summer and you guys would get a winter still, don't you?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, yeah, yeah.  We- well, we do live in a temperate climate.
L:  I got it, okay.  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, um, yeah, I mean, uh, in California you really don't have much of a choice because of the weather, it's always hot and sunny, you know.  You don't have -- you rather be outside than inside so most of the time, you know, I would rather be on the outside, um, you know, during the day.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE] No, I definitely -- I hear you.  Like, I've actually, like, I've only been to the West Coast, like, uh, once.  Huh.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] That was Reno, Nevada.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] That was as far as I got.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] But I could tell definitely from the climate difference I was experiencing out there, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, if I lived there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think I would probably prefer outdoor activities.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  [NOISE] But due to -- but once again, like, I live, like -- we get nor'easters.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Have you ever heard of a nor'easter?
L:  Um, I've heard about 'em, but I've nev- -- I -- I used to live in the East Coast[?] but I was in southeast.  Um, I was in Florida most of the time so I'm mostly, um, you know, prone to the hot weather and humidity and stuff.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] I gotcha.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah, like I said, uh, you have, like, the nor'easters come rip roaring through here all the time.
L:  Uh, uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] And we get, like, large lightning storms and thunder storms.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] And, like, this -- this year the jet stream has really not been working out in our favor.
L:  Oh, my go- --
R:  [NOISE] So, like, all of the nice weather that you get, like, because, like, the Pacific Ocean, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- blows --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- blows such -- such wonderful things over top of you, it -- it kind of like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it usurps you and then goes ahead and, like, like, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- kinda beats the hell out of us all the time.
L:  I know. [LAUGH] That's true.  We get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the nice weather and then we shoot it to the East Coast for you guys to get the rain and the thunderstorms and stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, exactly.  So, like, you know, if you guys could be a little less selfish and kind of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- blow upwards so that the weather wouldn't come this way.
L:  You know what, we -- we always offer it to everyone on the East Coast but there's something in the East Coast that it doesn't -- you guys don't wanna move to the West Coast.
R:  [NOISE] I think it likes to --
L:  It's not our fault.
R:  [NOISE] I think it just needs to discount the airfare is all it is.
L:  [LAUGH] You know what, you can get a very cheap airfares nowadays for, like, hundred dollars round trip.
R:  Oh, what -- what airline is that?
L:  Uh --
R:  [NOISE] If it's Value Jet I'm not in.
L:  No, no, no, no, no, really, US Air on Tuesday nights they do offer a lot of good deals.  They -- they auction their tickets on Tuesday night at -- it will be twelve o'clock your time, nine o'clock, um, you know, West Coast time, and they offer a hundred dollars round trip tickets.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Where do they do that?  How can I get in on that?
L:  You need to log -- you know, you need to sign up with them, because my brother, he lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they do travel a lot to visit us on the West -- West Coast.  And they always get -- get those tickets through their, um, website.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, well, what web- -- what -- what -- what -- what website?
L:  It's under -- um, it's under US Air dot com.
R:  Oh, okay, it's a US Air auction?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, I've heard that -- that their -- their personal finances haven't been so good recently.
L:  Yeah, but you know --
R:  That they are constantly, like, under, like, the threat of Chapter Eleven.
L:  Exactly.  But you know what, nowadays any airlines will do it.  You know, as far as safety you really don't have a [inaudible] to any of the airlines but you might as well get a good cheap ticket at least for traveling.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's -- I didn't realise I could get them for that cheap --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- with that method.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  [NOISE] Wow, Tuesday nights, huh?
L:  Tuesday nights, will be nine o'clock, um, East Coast time.
R:  Oh.
L:  They do auction their tickets.
R:  Really?  Wow.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know what, I think this Tuesday I may very well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- buy myself a round trip ticket.
L:  [LAUGH] Then [inaudible] try to come in because we're gonna have a beautiful weather this week.
R:  Yeah, wow, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] That's kinda cool.  I actually know someone who just moved out to LA.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [NOISE] He's going to grad school at UCLA for philosophy --
L:  On.
R:  -- the most useless degree ever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And so, like, uh, yeah, he's gonna, like, uh, get his Masters in philosophy so that --
L:  Good for him.
R:  -- he can hang around other schools --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, like, pretend that he knows what he's talking about.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] And kind of ironically enough, like, his minor is in physics.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I kid you not.
L:  Oh, my good --
R:  [NOISE] I don't make this stuff up.
L:  No, no, no, it's --
R:  [NOISE] It's just true.
L:  -- interesting from physics to philosophy.
R:  [NOISE] I know.  It's like he's kind of like decided to, like, take on, like, a contradiction.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] You know, which I actually respect a lot.
L:  That's true.
R:  [NOISE] Like, [inaudible] study --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- such a contradictory, you know, sorts of things.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause there's no philosophy in physics.
L:  I know.
R:  [NOISE] Physics is numbers.
L:  There is nothing in physics that you can, uh, argue about philosophically about it.
R:  [NOISE] And --
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE] And like, and -- and the truth is is that actually physics, like modern physics, like, are not as modern as people would like to think.
L:  And that's true.
R:  [NOISE] Because they're constantly -- they're constantly debunked, like --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- E -- E equals M.C. squared.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Like, that was shown to be not true.  Like, E equals M.X. squared.
L:  Uh-huh.  And what is that --
R:  [NOISE] Because --
L:  What is that [inaudible] --
R:  -- the speed of light is no longer con- constant.
L:  Uh.
R:  [NOISE] Like, they found out that there's some pulsars that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- emit light and it's faster than other light.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] Einstein's theory has been debunked.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  [NOISE] And, like, it's not, like, people aren't trying to, like -- like, the newspapers aren't printing it, like, front page because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- who really, like, who wants to pick on Einstein?
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  [NOISE] You know, do you wanna --
L:  But you know what, it's --
R:  -- pick on Einstein?
L:  It's a good -- yes, I do.  It's a good timing for you to come and visit your friend and, uh, visit California then.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So, um, in terms of, like, outdoor activities, what sort of thing do you fancy?
L:  Um, we- well, because, you know, we're -- um, I live about ten minutes from the beach so most of the time we are at the beach for walkings and, you know, swimmings and stuff.  And, uh, I do a lot of hiking, um, you know, with a group of friends.  And, um, a lot of biking, so it's mostly group activity that I love to do.
R:  [NOISE] I see, okay.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  [NOISE] If you -- if you don't mind me asking, uh, I kind of -- do I detect an accent?
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] Where are you from?
L:  Where -- where do you think I'm from?
R:  [NOISE] Um, I would think, like, either Germany or Finland.
L:  Er, no, it's actually -- I'm Persian.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, you're Persian?
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, how exotic.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Well, congratulations.
L:  Thank you.  Yeah, I've --
R:  [NOISE] I wish I had something cool to tell you with, but I'm just like a typical American mutt[?].
L:  No, you are not, don't ever say that.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, you're right, I'm a very atypical American mutt.
L:  Oh, my -- you seem like you're with a bunch of friends.
R:  I am with a bunch of friends.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] We actually -- we just walked out of one of our -- one of our favorite bars.
L:  Oh.
R:  And fort- -- fortunately for you I am the designated driver.
L:  Oh, God, so you can't consume any alcohol today, huh?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, I've consumed very little alcohol today.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Well, I hope to see you in California very soon.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Ah, ah, what's your name, hon?  Sorry, tell me again?

R:  Oh.  Ooh.

R:  I like that.
L:  Thank you.  I --
R:  Well, you know what, I can just tell you right now regardless of, like, what you look like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you're just hot.
L:  Thank you very much.
R:  [NOISE] Hey, no problem.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I speak the truth.  I think my --
L:  I wish I would -- we could --
R:  Wait, hold on, I'm taking a consensus from the group.  Everybody agrees. [NOISE] Everybody --
L:  Oh, thank you.

L:  Oh, my God.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] No, Schmila, Schmila's from Pakistan.
L:  Oh, she must be very pretty.
R:  Well -- well, she's actually from -- what? [NOISE] Africa? [NOISE] Oh, okay. [LAUGH] But she's not really Pakistani, she's actually American.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] Like, she was born in England and then im- imported over here, but she looks like a, you know, Pakistani.
L:  Yes, okay.  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] But definitely not in spirit, like only in, like, you know, physical looks.  And what are those anyway?  It's superficial.
L:  That's true.  But -- but have you met any Persians in Penn- -- there's a lot of Persians living in Pennsylvania.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I actually -- I think I have met, uh -- I think I went to high school with a couple of Persians that I was friends with.
L:  I got it, okay.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [NOISE] Definitely.  And, Sophie --

R:  Um, uh --
