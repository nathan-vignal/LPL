R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Dana.
R:  Hi, Dana.  I'm Pam.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Yeah, you too.  
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about our friends.
R:  Our friends.  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay, well, I've got, let's see, I've got some close ones and that's really all that I associate with still --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or now.  Um, 'cause I'm, uh, in my -- in my early twenties so, um, I've got one best friend that lives here in town with me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, another one that's not so close that lives in -- about thirty miles away in another town.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.  
L:  And another friend who I'm babysitting for today.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's a nice range of friends.  [LAUGH] 
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Me, myself.  I have -- I don't say I have a whole lot of friends but I, um, have a few friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I try to be close too.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, basically, you know, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with me with having a friend is somebody that I can trust.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Someone's that just gonna be there.  You know.  Someone that's --that's not gonna backstab you.  Things like that.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's important.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  That's what I consider, you know, a friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and basically for me I, you know, I -- I like people and I try to be, you know, a good friend to, you know, anybody that needs help, or whatever.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I try to be there.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they need someone to talk to or -- or they just need, you know, a -- a hand, you know.  [inaudible] that -- I think, basically, that's what a friend really is.  You know, someone that, uh, is gonna be there for you.
L:  Yeah.  That makes sense and ...
R:  You know, so ...
L:  You just -- I always do my best to try and be there for somebody.  Sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's hard.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I don't know, sometimes, like I found myself, 'cause I have a -- a new baby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he's four, well, he's almost five months old.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  And so I found myself having to cut off some of my other friends that I had before because they're just not in the same place in life.
R:  That's it.  Yeah.
L:  And -- yeah, they're still out having fun and they're carefree and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- careless and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I can't have that around because I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I concentrate on everything, so ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And it -- it was a really hard adjustment for me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to do that because, you know, you -- you care about this person and --
R:  That's it.
L:  -- you like him and you want him in your life but at the same time --
R:  That's it.  Yeah.
L:  -- it's a bad influence.  
R:  Yeah, sometime y- y- you just have to make a choice 'cause, you know, 'specially having a baby, you know, you can't, y- you know, you could do the things that you did -- you still do but then, you know, again to, you know, you want to spend more time with your [MN] -- more of a your time, you know, to that child and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so ...  And I know, like, um, when I was younger and stuff I had a lot of friends 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I, you know, I partied all the time.  Had a lot of friends.  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And basically, uh, for myself I don't really have a lot of female friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I get along with a lot of guys.  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So basically, you know, uh -- and, uh, I don't -- I don't know.  You know, I'm -- I choose women friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, to be my friend.  
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, 'cause, uh, my ma she --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she told us when we were younger, you know, that, uh, you know, women are, you know, schemers and backstabbers and things like that.  You [LAUGH] know, so ...
L:  Yeah.  And they -- they can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be without even thinking about it.  I know that I've done some things in the past --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I didn't think about and, you know, now that I look back it's like, wow, I really didn't come off very good that time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, it just didn't occur to me.  I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think women are more sensitive too and they -- they do though.  They --
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  They have --
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  They have ultimate [MN] alternatives sometimes.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, sometime if they want something, you know, they -- they'll definitely go after it, you know.  [LAUGH]  Despite, you know, even your --
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Even your best friend can turn on you.  You know, 'cause, uh, I -- I had a real good friend.  We were roommates at one time and, you know, she stepped out of line, you know.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Went -- went out with my boyfriend, so ...
L:  [several inaudible words] that.
R:  And it's hard for me to really, uh, trust women friends, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, I -- I'm very choosy about, you know, [MN] women friend, you know, being my friends.  You know, so ...
L:  Were you able to still room together after?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  Uh-uh.  We broke that off quick and in a hurry.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because -- because, like, I'm like -- I'm the type of the person, like, you know, uh, I don't step on your boundary, you don't step on my boundary.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  You respect each other.
R:  That's it, you know.  And when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when somebody you, uh, you know, that you ran with a long time.  You were good friends for a long time and then all of a sudden they turn round and -- and, you know, do that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's hard to be a friend.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be a friend to that person again.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause, well, you realize that they really don't care --
R:  That's it.
L:  -- about you and what they do to you.  
R:  That's it.  You know.
L:  How they treat you.  
R:  And, you know, basically, you know, if a -- if a friend's gonna be a friend, you know, um, then they --
L:  So, tell me did --
R:  -- don't do that.
L:  -- the guy ...?
R:  What's that?
L:  Did -- was the guy still around?
R:  Well, um, I got rid of both of them.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  'Cause you know what?  You know, a lot of times the -- the girl would -- +would get on the other person, uh, the other girl --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but not the guy.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And I always thought about, well, how come, you know, a woman always jump on the other woman -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but never on the guy?
L:  Uh-huh.  And the guy's do the same thing too.  
R:  That's it.  You know.
L:  When their girlfriend goes out with somebody they get mad at the guy.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, so ...
L:  Yeah, it's both of their fault.
R:  Yeah.  And, you know --
L:  It's [inaudible].
R:  -- 'cause, you know, [MN] basically it takes two to tango.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.  So ...  But anyhow I think a friend is -- is someone that's gonna really be there for you, you know, uh, through thick and thin.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, and you be there for that person.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, and -- 
L:  Long term +friends.
R:  -- having a friend that you can go out with and have a good time with and, you know, and ...
L:  Do you have any friends that you've had for years and years?
R:  Uh, I [MN] -- I used to.  I used to.  But, uh, you know, as you get older and stuff, you know, you go in different directions and, you know, some they used to run with, you know, they go in different direction, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  And, you know --
L:  Totally.
R:  Then y- you know, you start, you know, picking new -- new people to be your friends --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and stuff too, you know.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know. 
L:  And it's -- it's better for everybody sometimes that way.  That --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  That --
R:  I think so.
L:  -- little thing that, um, that make new friends but keep the old.  One is silver and the other gold.  I always think about that for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some reason but sometimes it's impossible to keep the old.  I mean, sometimes you just grow apart and you're not good for each other anymore.
R:  That's it.  That's it, you know.  And sometime, you know, um, like you -- like you said.  Uh, you know, you have a baby and your fr- your friends, y- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that you ran +with you don't run with them anymore, you know, so ...  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, then you start picking up, you know, different friends that, you know, are in the situation that you are in, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You have things in common, you know.  Things you can talk about and relate to, you know.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, uh, the ones that you ran with, you know, they -- they on a different, you know, level of what they do, you know.  So, you know, they still out there doing their thing and, you know, you have to, you know, before it's possible and, you know, in doing your thing.  You know.
L:  Yeah, well, like yesterday we went, um, the girlfriend that I was talking about that I'm kind of venturing away from.  We went --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to this thing called the Strawberry Festival.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Um, and they have the largest strawberry shortcake in the nation, I think.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  They built there.  Yeah.
R:  Strawberry's my favorite.  
L:  I didn't have any.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We came the day after they did this -- the actual making of the huge strawberry shortcake.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, anyway the festival was fun and we went and then afterwards we were gonna go, um, lay out in the sun and just 'cause it was, like, a hundred degree weather here.
R:  Mm.
L:  It was really hot.
R:  Wow.  Uh-huh.
L:  So we were gonna lay out by the water and cool --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- down and stuff and she pulled out these really big, huge oval floaty things to float down --
R:  Oh, my gosh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the river on.  Which would normally, I would just love that.  And I would just think that was so much fun and I'd --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- jump on and float down the river.  But, I mean, with a five year old in my hand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't.  First of all, I -- I wasn't even comfortable taking him in the river.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause it's so dangerous.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  And you can fall and -- and it was --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- real shallow.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, we went down to the rocks and -- and tried to lay down and it was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just -- it was not working.  I was, like [LAUGH] here, I have to show you what -- what a relaxing time for me [LAUGH] is.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  We went up in the shade and lay [LAUGH] down.  'Cause the baby can't be in the sun all the time.
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  He gets overheated and stuff.  Took a blanket and lay down in the shade and ...
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  She still got her tan and stuff but it was totally different then.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What we would be doing.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  So where are you from?
L:  Oregon.
R:  Oregon?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  I -- I'm in Washington State.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I lived in Seattle just recently for a --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Did you like it?
L:  Yeah, it's -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's beautiful.  I mean, they have so much stuff there and we've got --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- family there.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Um, but ...
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  My -- my sister actually lives up there now.  
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  And I love it.  It's so much more expensive though.
R:  Yeah.  And -- 
L:  I mean, just to go to the grocery store, everything costs a little bit more.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  And ...
R:  But, you know, there -- there's so much diversity there.  You know, in Seattle.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, this --
L:  That's true.  [LAUGH] 
R:  There's so much -- so much to do here.  You know, you can't really get bore.  You know.
L:  I know.  Compared to Oregon.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  There's not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- exactly diversity in Oregon.
R:  Yeah.  But, you know, um, I -- I did have this one girl.  We were friends for a long time and -- and, like, uh, I always kind of like, you know, I don't like people dumping on my friends and stuff, you know.  And I -- I'm kind of like, you know, I watch out for them.  You know, or stick up for them or whatever.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  
R:  So, you know, um, and I -- and I do have this one friend, um, right now.  We're pretty good friends and stuff and she just had a baby too.  And, uh, so we- we're hanging -- we're hanging out together and stuff.  But at the same time the type of people that I hang with, you know, uh, she's not used to being around.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So therefore, you know, I kinda watch out for her because I don't want nobody taking advantage of her, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And
