L:  Hi, I'm Jean from New Jersey.
R:  [NOISE]  Hello, I'm Cat.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm in Virginia.
L:  And -- and what is your name?
R:  Cat.
L:  Cat?
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Okay.  Hi, Cat.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  
L:  Yeah, and how is everything in Virginia. 
R:  Uh, kind of soggy.
L:  Oh, yeah, well, this is the first day in New Jersey that we've had -- had sun.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  And [MN] [LAUGH].  We have had all that -- that miserable rain.  But I -- I think our topic is friends.  
R:  Yes.
L:  And, um, I remember something from my -- my old girl scout, brownie days.  Where they -- where they said make new friends and keep the old.  One is silver, the other is gold.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.   
L:  [LAUGH]  You remember that one?
R:  Well, I do.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  But that's been a long time ago.
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]  But it just always stuck in my head.  Um.  [LIPSMACK]  I have lots of friends.  I have some really close friends.  I have, um, friends that I've had since, um, high school.  Uh, which is a long time ago.  
R:  Well, I can't say that I do because I've moved from my home state.
L:  Oh, o- [MN] okay.  
R:  So I kind of left everybody behind.  
L:  Oh, I've been in New Jersey my whole ti- -- whole entire life so I ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm originally from Ohio.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  And, um, then after I married and moved away, you know, course you lose contact.  I have gone back to, uh, one or two of my class reunions.  And tried to keep contact with one of my best friends.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And, um, then when I moved to Virginia I lost contact with her again.  
L:  Oh.  Have you tried looking on the internet to, uh, try to locate your friend?
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've tried just about everything but, um, she was into politics and, uh, [NOISE] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I really believe that she probably went back to England.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Because she had spent a lot of time in England.
L:  Oh, so she probably relocated and ...
R:  Yeah.  But since I've been here, I mean, I have acquaintances but I --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I can't really say that there's anybody that's actually --
L:  Well, I -- I consider my --
R:  -- a friend.
L:  I consider my neighbors my friends since I've been here, um, for almost thirty years, in the same house.  They became not only my friends and my family and, uh, so ...  And I -- I --
R:  No.  I -- I [LAUGH] --
L:  I have an ol- --
R:  -- regretfully can't say that about my neighbors.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, you know, sometimes they're a little bit too nosy and then, you know, they're over helpful as friends and ...  But they're loyal and they're fun to be with.  And that's what I consider my, you know, my friends.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I have a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- home -- I have a home business and I meet lots of people.  Um, you know, throughout my home business.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  What do you do?
L:  Um, I'm a independent beauty consultant with Mary Kay cosmetics.  
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, I have my home business too.
L:  Oh, what do you do?
R:  I do, um, home and garden party.
L:  Oh, how 'bout that.  Well, see then, you -- you should be meeting lots of friends.
R:  Well, th- the thing is, is that, uh, since I've moved here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess it's not a popular thing in Virginia, so I'm having a real hard time getting it going here.
L:  Well, see Mary Kay, uh, I meet a lot of friends because Mary Kay is [MN] basically a, um, a consumable product.  They use it.  It goes, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right down your drains but ...
R:  Yes.
L:  But, uh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah, and it's -- and it's widely known too.  
L:  Absolutely.  Um, I think I've been to the one of the demos.  Um, [LIPSMACK] one of the demos that you do.  Uh, at, you know, in this area we h- we have, like, a -- a consultant or a demonstrator.  
R:  Mm.  
L:  [MN]  Yeah, um ...
R:  Yeah, cause I know there's home interior, which I used to do that too.
L:  Okay.  I'm familiar with home interior also.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Okay.  So you have a way of m- meeting people.  
R:  Yeah.  And, um, before I did, uh, not here, not in this state, but I've done the, um, home interior and beauty control.
L:  Oh, beauty control, okay.
R:  And Avon.  And just so many different things. 
L:  [MN]
R:  But yeah, that's a good way to meet friends but ...
L:  Do you meet friends on the internet?
R:  [MN]  No.
L:  [MN]  No?
R:  No.  I have, um, in chat rooms.
L:  R- -- okay.
R:  But, um, had a bad experience in chat rooms so I bailed it.
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't normally go to the chat rooms --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where I meet a lot of friends.  Not necessarily through chat rooms.  Um, I belong to a -- a -- a group, uh, called Refunding Makes Cents.  And --
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Um, it's called Refunding Makes Cents and w- we -- we just chat about coupons and saving money and you -- I've met lots of friends through there.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah.  And, um, you know, we -- we find out where the good deals are throughout the United States.  Um, they let us know what the codes are to -- to place orders and get free shipping with Amazon dot com.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, so it's, you know, you me- y- you meet a lot of friends through the internet but I do know what you're re- referring to on the chat rooms with the friends.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I -- I've --
R:  Well, my best friend is still my husband.
L:  Oh.  I don't have one, unfortunately.  I been a widow for, oh, many years.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah, raised my -- my sons myself.  So my friends are important to me.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  You know, I've always h- had to depend on, um --
R:  That could make a difference.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if your husband's your best friend that's wonderful.
R:  Well, he was my best friend and then my husband and so, you know, he's still my best friend.
L:  Oh.  See you have a best friend.  
R:  Well --
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  How 'bout your family?  I know -- I know I -- I have very, very little family so I don't really have a best friend.  I was an only child but ...
R:  Um, no, I'm the oldest of five.  
L:  Oh.  So you're --
R:  And --
L:  -- the leader?
R:  Yeah.  And there's, uh, still four of us.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  And, uh, but my -- my children live in Texas so I'm pretty far from them.  
L:  Oh, my gosh.  I have two sons and actually my youngest [MN] -- I -- I would have to say is probably my best friend, because it was just he and I a, you know, most of the time.  His brother went off to college right after their father passed away so it was just my youngest son and I, so I'd have to say he's my best friend.  You know, and he just moved down -- out on his own. 
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  Well, mine have been gone for a while.  My baby's twenty eight.
L:  My baby's twenty four.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I can give you that w- website if you wanted for Refunding Makes Cents.
R:  What is it?
L:  Okay.  It's Refunding Makes Cents.  It's W.W.W.

R:  Okay.
L:  You can just go in and -- and visit.  And I'm telling you, there was so many friends.  And they're so helpful.  Um, they'll -- they're helpful in the way if, uh, you need a long distance carrier they'll tell you -- everyone will put their opinion in and you get it -- a really good feedback.  An honest feedback.  Um, of which carrier to call and which one is offering the best discounts or not giving you a discount and the same with food.  What -- what, um, supermarkets -- I believe you have Foodline down there?
R:  Yeah, Foodline and, uh, I generally do, um, Foodline or Walmart.
L:  Okay.  They'll tell you, you know, what's on sale at Walmart.  What to look for.  Uh, how they're accepting the coupons.  Who's doubling.  Um, it's absolutely phenomenal and they tell you, um, where to save.  They give you different codes, uh, where to save money when you're ordering off the internet.
R:  Huh.
L:  And, like, for free shipping, free discount codes.  
R:  Wow.
L:  Um ...
R:  Well, I got on there today and actually saw that there's a site where you can list your garage sale.  
L:  Right.  Okay.  We talk about that all the time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Among friends we talk about that all the time.  I -- I would say there's probably -- it's a very secure site.  Um, there's only +about, maybe, um, I would have to say twenty, thirty thousand people on the site.  Um, or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's -- yeah.  So it's --
R:  Yeah, 'cause I got on this today[?] 'cause we are planning on having a garage sale this weekend.
L:  Me -- me too.  And we meet -- you can meet lots of friends.  [MN]
R:  And I thought okay, let's see.  Uh, well, actually I was gonna see, you know, what's the best way to get, uh, the most profitable [MN] amount of money from your garage sale.  And I thought I'd just click on.  I'd say garage sale and it would say, you know, other people would have ideas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there was one lady that was selling a book but, you know, I'm not gonna buy a book to have a garage sale.
L:  [LAUGH]  No, I --
R:  And then I saw that there was places where you could actually list your garage sale.  
L:  Huh.  That's interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But w- [MN] we talk about that all the time.  If you've just, you know, ask the question, what about a yard sale?  How do you go about doing it?  People will answer you.  You have -- you may have to wait, you know, um, a little while but they'll answer you.  
R:  Uh-huh.
