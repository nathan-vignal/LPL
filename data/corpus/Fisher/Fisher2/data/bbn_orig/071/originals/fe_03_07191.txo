L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my na- --
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. 
R:  [MN]
L:  My name's Pam.
R:  Hi, I'm Connie from -- near Fort Maris[?], Florida.
L:  Oh.  Sounds good.  I'm in Ohio.  
R:  Oh, no.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's exactly what I say, Connie.  How are you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to date?
R:  Great.  
L:  Great.
R:  How are you?
L:  I --
R:  I just go in from work.  Just one minute ago so ...
L:  I actually work from home now.  I've worked for a doctor all my life it seems like.  And I'm a travel agent now and I'm sending everybody --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- down to Florida.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Well, that works too.  Hey, you -- you meet a lot of people that way.
L:  That's right.  I got --
R:  A good way to make new friends.
L:  -- friends all over the country now.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.
L:  Well, I guess, we're supposed to talk about friends?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, what do you think?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, let's see.  Right now I just have a few friends.
L:  Me too.
R:  I mean, a lot of acquaintances but few friends.
L:  I -- I used to have quite a few friends but it just seems like, I don't know.  [MN]  The same [MN] couple staple friends you've had all your life is the where to be.  It seems like the minute you turn your back they're hacking on you or --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- talking about you.  And that goes for family too.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, that's not -- that's a totally different topic.  
R:  Yeah.  I think you spread yourself too thin if you have too many friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you just don't have time to really, you know, in- increase your knowledge of them, or anything.
L:  Well, it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seems to me everybody, I don't care what walk of life you're in, what age you're i- -- uh bracket you're in, people don't have time today to do anything.  
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  Other than --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- work.
R:  Family.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Take care of family.  That's right.  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I guess if you really want to have a lot of friends [MN] it's -- it's a job.  You -- you -- you have to work at it.
R:  That's true, yeah.  And I -- I just slack off.  I really do.  
L:  I do too.
R:  So I let people call me instead.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.  Won't come out of the woodwork unless you call her.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And it just seems like we try to make plans, it just doesn't happen.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And the best way for us to -- to seem to do anything is for the moment, are you there, can you go now?
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  But --
R:  -- that does work.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I try sometimes to make plans and other time, you know, that falls through sometimes.  It just -- it's really hard, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Same here.
R:  I'm -- I'm getting a whole crowd together and, oh ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, forget it.  Oh, forget it.  I --
R:  We -- we do a lot of dinner parties.
L:  Do ya?
R:  You know, have friends, you know, several couples at a time but I -- I kind of like the one to one.
L:  Oh, I do too.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do too.  And we -- we owned, uh, our family owned two restaurants and I worked for, like, thirty years from [MN] from the first grade 'til -- 'til I worked for the doctor, and [MN] my husband worked and was off on Mondays.  I was off on Mondays.  Friends were off on weekends.  And it seemed like as we got older we -- we grew apart because we didn't have the same days off.
R:  Same days.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That makes a difference too.
L:  Yeah, so now he's in a factory and I'm working from home the last few months and it's a little bit easier, but now all my friends are [LAUGH] gone.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right too.  Oh, yeah.  
L:  But I've got a couple of friends that I know if I don't talk to 'em forever they're still there if I need 'em, and a couple that -- that I do call and talk to and eat out once in a while with and this and that, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- when your husband and you are on opposite ships it -- and then off on Mondays it  --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- makes it bad.
R:  It really does.  I grew up in Minnesota so when I call my friends back there, you know, when I'm -- when I'm in town or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, it's just like you've never been away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's kinda neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, your friends are still are your friends, you know.
L:  I've got a girlfriend that when she got married they moved to Texas and she come home for Christmas last year and it was just like [MN] she -- she never left.  And then you've --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- got people that you think you're friends with and you haven't seen 'em maybe for six months and when you do talk to 'em it's real --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- real --
R:  Strained.
L:  -- strained.  [LAUGH]  yes.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh.
L:  Like I said, I've got family that way too but that's a whole different topic.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It's -- my -- I'm pretty lucky with mine.  Um, my husband's family's have been kind of strange, so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, uh, my family's pretty good, so ...  He feels real comfortable with my family and I'm sure --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- that's his family too now, so, yeah.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you done these surveys before?
R:  No, it's my first one.
L:  This is my second one. 
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  But my kids said, "Mom, you don't have the trouble talking to a wall so ..."
R:  Oh, see.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's good.  That's good.  [MN]
L:  Oh, well.  Now do you -- do you consider yourself friends with, uh, coworkers?
R:  Yeah.  Except we never can go to lunch together because [MN] somebody has to always cover so it's -- it's kind of hard that way to make friends there.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Although, um, I'm showing apartments and so you -- you meet people too.  Uh ...
L:  Oh, you're a realtor?
R:  Um, well I don't have a licence but we do rentals so ...
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  It's a -- it apartment community.
L:  I see.
R:  And, uh, so I really get to meet a lot of people and, you know, s- some could be your friends so easy.  It's just like you click just like that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Instant.
L:  Exactly.  I've got clients that, uh, I, you know, like I've only done this now since the first of the year.  Like I said, I've worked out of the home since I could walk and, um, I've met -- I do this totally over the internet and, oh, I can do it locally but ninety nine percent of it's done over the internet and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I never meet them or m- most of them I ne- --
R:  Oh, no face to face.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'll tell you, I have got some that are so dear to me that if I don't hear 'em -- from 'em once a week and they stop and say hello on the phone or on the internet I -- I wonder if they're okay.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And the other night I had to call one and see if she was around 'cause I hadn't heard from her in two months, and I really love it.  I've become really good friends with --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh.
R:  -- several of these clients.  Like I said, I've only done this since -- since January.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I love it.  
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.  Really.
R:  But our -- our main focus is Disney.  And so I'm sending everybody --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- down to see you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, right.  Well, hey.  You can make friends with Disney people, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have a good time.  A lot -- a lot in common.  So ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now my fr- -- my son and my daughter go to school on the internet and, um --
R:  Uh-huh
L:  -- my son has got friends across the world.  I mean, and just fantastic.  Virtual friends.  And --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, I mean, if there's a problem in the family [MN] somebody's sick or the dog hurt his knee the other night, everybody's on the internet wanting to know how the dog is.  And he says, "Mom, you know", he says, "When I went to brick and mortar School", he said, "the f- the -- the friends weren't like these are".  He says these are close --
R:  Yeah.  And they care.
L:  They're [MN] -- yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- was a friend of his that got me into this job.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But he's got all sorts of friends that go to s- -- uh -- or work at Disney and stuff and that's how, you know, it's -- it's really -- really neat.  And he says if I had to do one or the other, he says, "Mom, I think I'd keep the ones I've got online".  He says they're --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- fantastic to me.  And I always thought he was kinda crazy [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know, now that I'm dealing with the internet and these people I see where he's coming from.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  My daughter teases me,  "Mom, you're getting just like him".
R:  Well, yeah, but look because of his friends there you are with a job.  A new job.
L:  Right.
R:  So I mean --
L:  From my living room and I've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  I've worked out of the home, like I said, since my dad had me walk and I was working, and it was a real hard thing to do because I felt worthless when I wasn't busy at first and -- and -- because I'm not going to work.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And so now, you know, it's -- it's coming.  It's getting busier.  Its cogs are starting to turn but it was a hard change.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's sure -- I was home for just a few short months, way, way, way, way, back and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I had a girlfriend.  Everyday she'd come over and we'd have coffee and talk a- -- we could talk for hours.
L:  Yep.
R:  Hours and hours on every single day.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And--
L:  I -- when I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- quit my [MN], uh, job as a chiropractic assistant, um, [MN] there were four, five, six patients calling me a day, uh, wanting to know how I was, where I was, what was going on because I had more like a friendship with them than I did a patient --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- relationship.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, they come in there more often than a normal doctor's office and it, uh, you -- you become friends with them.  And I -- I really miss that.  But I, like I said --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- got a lot of clients now that are real close to me and I'm building that repertoire now too so ...
R:  Well, when my husband went to therapy we really became good friends with therapist and stuff and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we email him back and forth every now and then.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That --
R:  Still keep in touch.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that -- that's me.  That was me because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they've dealt with me more than the doctor.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  And, shoot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was nicer than the doctor [LAUGH] so ...
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Oh, isn't it neat to talk to somebody and just be able to smile and keep going, you [LAUGH] know.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just --
R:  That's pretty good.
L:  -- smile and ride on out the door.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, uh, yeah, [MN] few friends is plenty for me.  Keep them happy.  They keep you happy and don't try to break records with it.  
R:  That's true.  Yeah.  You know, [MN] we have friends that we see about four times a year and it's usually for holidays we all get together, but during the rest of the time it's hard, like you said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with schedules and everything.
L:  With kids and everything.  
R:  And [MN] [LAUGH]  
L:  You're going in opposite directions.  
R:  Uh, here we have pictures of Christmas, after Christmas after Christmas with the same [LAUGH] people.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  At our house, you know.  
L:  Still putting up --
R:  And it's -- it's not --
L:  -- with you.
R:  -- my family.  It's just people, you know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's so funny.  Yeah. Yeah.  [MN]
L:  That's neat.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's neat.  
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  We have dogs.  We have two dogs and, uh, so you make friends sometimes because people see you with the dogs and they're like, oh, they talk to you because of the dogs, you know.
L:  Because of the dog.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  It's a good --
L:  My -- my small dog just jumped off the couch a couple a nights ago and tore his +cruciate liga- -- knee -- tendon across his knee.
R:  [MN]
L:  And he --
R:  Bad.
L:  -- can't walk.  I have to --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- carry him out --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Carry him in and, of course, it's a thousand dollar surgery.  The dog is older but he's in --
R:  Whoa.
L:  -- perfect health.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's like a baby.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So I -- well, I got a say really my -- my dogs are my friends.
R:  Yeah.  They are.  Unconditional.
L:  Un- un- unconditional --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- love.  That is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- right.
