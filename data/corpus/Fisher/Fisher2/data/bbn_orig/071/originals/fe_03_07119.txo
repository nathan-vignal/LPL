R:  Robert Nixon.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Hi!
R:  Hi!
L:  Ah, this is Wanda, how are you?  [SIGH]
R:  Good, how about yourself?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I'm fine.  [LAUGH]  I wonder if they're doing this as a result of the Martha Stewart thing?  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, yeah, I believe so.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Have you done ... o- one of these before?
R:  N- no --
L:  No.
R:  -- actually not.
L:  This is, like, my second one.  [MN]  So, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] it's kind of a strange ... f- format but I think you talk whatever for ten minutes and then [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- follow electronics.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] so, ah, if you want to start it would be great.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  No, you go ahead because, um, [LAUGH] I just don't what to say about this, s- specific topic [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- except that I think it's, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm thinking
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --Martha Stewart when I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- h- heard about it.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Y- yeah, um, you know, t- the I -- I think personally it's -- it's happened, ah, for -- for many -- it's probably happened many, many, many different times but just because she's, ah, [SIGH] [MN] well known and for some reason, ah -- a- ah [SIGH] --
L:  Not well liked.  [SIGH]
R:  -- not well liked or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe just in a sense of just is in the wrong place at the wrong time, you know, the -- this -- this was made to line.  And otherwise I think probably she would have [SIGH] -- ... probably have gotten away with it to be honest with you, so ... [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm sure it happens quite a bit, you know, so ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] now were they asking about ... our t- thoughts about government --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, government --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- trying to curb this --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I -- I wasn't sure.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I didn't really understand the question.  I think, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, that -- that they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you think that the government should try to curb these kind of things?  Well, I don't think they can only because it [SIGH] -- ah, you can try to but I don't know if they'd be any real easy way of [SIGH] -- of stopping people from doing insider trading, you know, or inside information --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- 'cause it's just something that happens, you know, that -- it's +like people always will break the law and [NOISE] -- and, ah, [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I -- I --
R:  -- things like that.
L:  -- really don't see how they can get ... involved in it.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just ... [SIGH] I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's j- just -- it's just different.  And I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I worked --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at companies I -- I never --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thought of government as ... part of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the s- structure, you know.  It was --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L: -- just totally a different thing --
R:  [NOISE]  And I --
L:  -- I don't --
R:  -- [NOISE] don't know if it would be wise anyway to have the government involved, you know, with [SIGH] dealing with people's money like that as well.  And, uh- uh, they -- they really have a lot of control of the stock market in -- in itself, you know, and [SIGH] -- and I don't know if any more government, ah, [SIGH] interference or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whatever else you want to call it, y- you know, it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it wouldn't be any -- make any real difference and in fact it might even make it worse you know, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- you know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I agree with you.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Are you a stockbroker?   [LAUGH]
R:  No, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, no, no, no.  No --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I have some friends that are in ... ah, [MN] -- no, ah, I -- I, um, [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I kind of watch the stock market but I don't actually [NOISE] --
L:  Participate.
R:  -- participate in it. Yeah, I've kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, watched my friends do it [NOISE] and m- make quite a bit of money [NOISE] and I've also seen quite a few of them lose [SIGH] a lot of money as well.  And [NOISE] [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- [MN] I've kind of been party -- sometimes just [SIGH] quasi inside information, nothing like to that level but, a- a- ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know, [SIGH] just from people that work at certain companies who tell me when they're s- stocks were going to split or, you know, things like that.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] nothing like -- nothing to this level but, ah, [SIGH] you know, I can understand why -- how and why it happened, you know.  And I'm not really honestly even sure she ... [SIGH] you know, ju- -- if she really did what they said they did -- she did and all that.  I don't know.  Ah, we -- we --
L:  You know, I could see it happening too because, um, I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've worked for, ah, couple of companies, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that were public and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, same things -- ah, s- stock splitting and then them telling friends, I mean, I guess that would be c- considered --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- inside trading [SIGH] --
R:  Exactly, and --
L:  -- you know, I -- I just --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- it's almost like you're spreading --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good news and, "Hey, by the way this might be a good time to buy".  I -- I don't know I see it happening all the time.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, in -- that's why I'm saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't really think that, ah, which -- you know, that n- necessarily to me wasn't [NOISE] [SIGH] a bad thing, you know, it's almost like your friends were warning you of something, you know, and "Hey, you may -- you may want to watch out because I -- you know, I know, f- for example, like, I know the company's going to go down the -- the tubes" [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- you know.  And -- and, a- again, it also depends on the level, ah, --
L:  Of information.
R:  -- [SIGH] if she -- you know, if they w- weren't telling people or -- the -- and anybody -- they didn't tell anybody else this information and she only knew about it then, that -- and then I can understand that but I'm sure a lot of o- other [NOISE] people all over the world probably end up selling their stock and [SIGH] -- and besides her.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which is what I've been very curious about is oth- other -- other people have done it [NOISE] --
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  -- 'cause if, you know.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] hasn't she stepped down, um, from that role and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now is c- calling herself t- the chief, um, creative officer or something?
R:  I think so, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I heard that last night, so, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think she's trying to detach herself from the company.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I'm sure she's -- that's a good -- it's, you know, it's the whole legal maneuvering thing, you know, from being, [SIGH] you know, now being accused and, you know, arrested and all that, you know.  So, I'm sure that's -- that's part of the game, you know.  And, ah, [NOISE] -- [SIGH] um, [SIGH] you know, it makes sense to me why she would do that, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's a little too late that's my feeling [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I -- it is -- I -- I, ah, [SIGH] I'm -- I hope --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I hope the best for her but I can see how this happens all the time.  I've seen it happen.  So, ... --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know.  Anyway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, how did you hear --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about this type of [NOISE] study?
R:  [NOISE]  Um, actually they called me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah -- but the place -- this place, ah, [NOISE] -- the company that does this, I guess [NOISE] my wife, ah, does it on [SIGH] [NOISE] occasion and she asked if I would do it [NOISE] you know, and I -- I get the -- [NOISE] I figured I'd give it a shot.  [NOISE]  I've kind of pass -- passed it over [NOISE] about [SIGH] three or four calls, you know, and I thought, "Well, you know, I'm here now and --"
L:  What the hell!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- try it out and see --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of course, I get this nice [SIGH] -- you know, strange topic --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, of course, they [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but she -- she's done other ones.  They seem pretty easy but --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- um [NOISE] ...
L:  This is a strange one, I just --
R:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, anyway, well you did good, I don't know if I par- ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- added anything --
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, no, [SIGH] it's interesting to see what they do with this s- stuff.
R:  Yeah, I'd like to know what actually is -- what this is u- used for but [MN] --
L:  You never know.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  I -- I did one --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, about education and, ah, I talked to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, my -- the partner that I had was a former teacher so [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he had some interesting things to say.  We started talking about, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- home -- home sch- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- home -- home teaching or home schooling --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.  [SIGH]  Anyway they have some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- interesting topics that come up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's for sure.
R:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Yeah, what other t- topic -- did -- you did two -- is this the second one?  [NOISE]
L:  Mm, this is the second one, yep.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  They call me, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- almost every night --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and e- either I'm here or not --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- -or I'm at -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so sometimes I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm available and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sometimes I'm not.  So, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and once they have your number --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they seem to call you --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, at least three or four times a week.  So, --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm always hearing the phone ring and then I'm just like, taking a message and ask my wife, "Hey, do you want to do it?"  "No, not today" you know --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Yeah, I'll do it" and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I never really listen to see what it is, you know, but, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I actually -- I work for Microsoft.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you do.  Are you --
R:  Yeah, I'm a --
L:  -- out in California?
R:  No, I'm in -- I'm in Texas here.  I work, ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] doing game testing for the Xbox.  [MN]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  G- game design [NOISE] things like that.  So, --
L:  That's cool.
R:  --kind of strange they called me, you know, I was thinking of how I related to this topic, you know, [SIGH] and --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- you know, I figured they kind of would take a [SIGH] -- people that like are in the stock market or, you know, brokers or you know, whatever and [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- so they could get their information.  So, ...  [MN]
L:  Well, that's interesting.  You know, I, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've -- I've worked for a lot of companies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I've ... done corporate communications --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for them and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I get, you know, it's j- just part of being part --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in that role -- the marketing role.
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH] I -- I could just see all that stuff that g- gets communicated and, especially you know, when good things happen so [SIGH] I can just see how this could --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have -- could happen to anyone -- this --
R:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- completely.  [SIGH]  And like I said I -- I've gotten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- quite a bit myself, you know.  And I'm not really even party to -- even take advantage of it but, ah, [SIGH] I could have you know.  And a lot of my friends at Dell, for example, ah, back in the nineties, [SIGH] ah, you know, they -- they'd been working there and they knew full well the day and the time and --
L:  Yep.  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, this is going to happen, it's going to s- split or triple split or, you know, whatever.  And [SIGH] you know if I'd r- really wanted to I could have taken [NOISE] advantage of that, you know, and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] -- yeah.
L:  And would you have gotten in trouble or would they have gotten in --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- trouble -- I mean you know?
R:  That's a good question.  That --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really is a good question.  I really don't know because I mean this is kind of similar but it's not the same, obviously, but [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- ah, it might -- y- y- you -- you know.  I'm sure it -- I'm sure i- it wasn't necessarily legal but it -- [SIGH] I don't know how illegal it was, you know, if I -- if I'd have actually acted upon it, you know.  But --
L:  Y- yeah, I don't know.
R:  -- [SIGH] it's just a real weird --
L:  It is.
R:  -- ... convoluted kind of [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  And the rules are not ... that well defined --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- in my opinion or at least not well known --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, you hear about inside trading but, I -- I'm not sure [SIGH] if I understand well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what -- what are the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- p- parameters, what are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  the boundaries --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know.  I -- I -- it just seems --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- unclear to me.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I -- I think maybe after this they'll probably -- they may try to, ah, ... clear that up, you know, or make it more ... [SIGH] defined what is trading -- inside trading, and what is not, you know, and --
L:  I think that might be a good thing.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  So, what do you do?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I -- I, ah, I do, ah, um, corporate --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- communications.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I work for, um, [LIPSMACK] myself -- I do, ah -- [LIPSMACK] um, you know, P- PR and ... a lot of other ... marketing activities, web sites and stuff, co- co- --writing content and copy and [SIGH] -- anything having to do with [LAUGH] marketing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I do for high tech.
R:  Sounds good, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
R:  It's a lot of fun.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it is fun.  It is fun.  I, um, I enjoy it and -- and I've seen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- t- the guts of companies and -- and, ah, [SIGH] you know, I've been in that role where I could definitely leak information.  But, you know, when you're in that role you really have to ... take it upon yourself to [SIGH] hold it close to the -- close to your heart but it's h- hard not to sometimes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm -- I'm in the same position.
L:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  There's always stuff.  There's information.  There's -- [SIGH] I see stuff on the Internet all people guessing and all this, you know, like, ah, [SIGH] people guessing right now if there's going to be a second X -- for example, a second Xbox is going to come out, ah, [SIGH] it's smaller and, you know, things like this.  Like, in -- in -- and it may not seem that important but [SIGH] to the -- to the gaming industry that is a ma- -- like, v- vitally -- like -- like a nugget.  If you knew the information and you start spreading the information, I mean they know right away somebody in the inside was [SIGH] -- was, ah, --
L:  Doing it.
R:  -- divulging that, you know.  And I know all about [SIGH] the so -- so called project, it went like this and, ah, and when it's gonna happen and how it is you know.  But if I say something then [MN] of course that's a big -- that's a big no no, you know.  So, ...
L:  Y- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  So, ...
L:  It's interesting.  [LAUGH]
R:  It is actually.  [LAUGH]
L:  You get on the boards and find out what people are --
