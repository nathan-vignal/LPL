R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Joanne.
R:  Hi.  And I'm Sue.  I'm from Indiana.  Where are you from?
L:  Wilmington.  Delaware.
R:  Delaware.  Oh, that's --
L:  Have you ever heard of Delaware?
R:  I've been through there before.
L:  Really?  Oh, not -- some -- not too many people know where it is.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Yeah, it doesn't take you very long to go through there.
L:  No.  
R:  [LAUGH]  No.
L:  No.  In and out.  In and out.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, we're, uh -- [SIGH] the topic is, uh -- this is the first time you did this?
R:  This is the second time.
L:  Second time.
R:  Uh--
L:  Okay.  
R:  And it -- it usually -- it goes pretty fast.  The topic is, uh, corporate scandals and how it affects you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it affects us quite a bit.  Because it's affecting the -- the stock market.
L:  Yeah. I -- I don't think I have that opinion.  
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  I don't -- I don't think it affects us that much.  I mean, there's other things that come into it.  There are stocks that are affected.  Definitely.  Like Martha Stewart and, you know, different people.  But I don't -- I don't think the, uh, the main, uh, you know, ninety five percent of all the stocks, I don't think are affected at all.
R:  Oh, I don't know.  I think if -- they haven't even reached the tip of the iceberg.  I think there's so much corruption anymore.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, that's not a bad -- th- that's -- that's something to look at too.  But, uh --
R:  People are just outright greedy.  [LAUGH]  You know, they -- they -- they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- out to kill each other.  So, uh ...
L:  What do you think should happen to Martha Stewart?
R:  Well, I think she -- she should have a severe penalty but I don't think she'll get it.
L:  No.  Do you think she should go to jail?
R:  I don't know if that's a -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I think that she knew what she was doing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause she has been -- she was a stockbroker.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At one time.  So she knows stock.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She knows the rules.  She knows how to do it.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I think that she knew exactly what she was doing.  
L:  Well, I think you're right there.  I think she did too.  
R:  So, you know, but as far as going to jail because of that?  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  No, I know.  I know.  Well, I just, uh -- well, what do you think about Enron?
R:  I think that's a crying shame.  Those people lost all their savings.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think that -- they -- they should go to jail.  That's a different -- that's a different thing than -- than what she was doing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, they out and out stole from the company.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I guess, um, like I said, everybody has different opinions about this.  I -- I think what should happen to Martha Stewart is she would have to, uh, sell all her sheets and all, like for half price, and she would have to, uh, take like a couple a million dollar hit and, uh, she would have to bring all the jobs back so they all are in the United States, not in a certain other country.
R:  That's a good idea.  
L:  You know, make all the sheets.  Anything she makes, half price.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that -- that's --
L:  And people --
R:  -- a good idea.  People might get --
L:  Yeah.  And then her stocks --
R:  -- [inaudible].
L:  -- her stock, uh, you know, people that had the stock wouldn't be, uh, hurt too bad because people will be buying it anyway.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  
L:  So let the -- let the people buy [inaudible] products[?].  People can always use sheets.
R:  Oh, yeah.  No, she doesn't just have sheets.  She has all kinds of different things.
L:  Well, whatever she has, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, just, uh, lower the prices.  Half off, whatever.  
R:  Yeah.  That w- that would way -- be a way of getting people to trust her brand, I guess.  
L:  Well, also it should be a -- uh, like Evita Peron.  Like [LAUGH] like a heroine.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  I don't -- I don't think she's anything that bad.  I think that that goes on all the time and she's a woman.  She's a powerful --
R:  Well, she just --
L:  -- woman.
R:  -- got caught.  
L:  Huh?
R:  She just got caught.
L:  Yeah, right.  And I think that they're gonna make an example and a -- if you notice, uh, there's not many women that do this.
R:  That's true.  
L:  And so I think that she, uh, will just, um, um, uh, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] I was gonna say --
R:  Well they picked her up 'cause --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- sh- she was --
L:  It's just --
R:  -- a --
L:  It's just like a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a -- a, um, a, you know, in a highway[?] for profiling.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Once in a while they give a ticket to a white person.  They have to.  
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They picked her out because she was h- high profile and they knew that she was associated with that man and -- and her stockbroker kinda didn't help her out any.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He was --
R:  But --
L:  He was just stupid.  
R:  Well, yeah.  But he's just a salary paid person, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  But they --
L:  Yeah.  No, I -- I know what you're saying.  I just don't -- [MN] whatever -- whatever penalty they give her or -- or what do you think?  They're gonna make her go to a -- a prison next to a rapist?  She's gonna go to somewhere and they're gonna make her, uh, uh, make some -- some stuff for the prison or something.
R:  Well, that's true.  I -- I j- -- I -- a- as far as jail time, I don't know if -- it -- but if other people have been caught for insider trading and they have gone to jail then she should have the same sentence.
L:  They don't -- they don't even -- yeah, when you're talking a jail you're talking thirty days somewhere.
R:  Yeah, well, or a su- --
L:  I mean, it's not a jail.
R:  -- suspended sentence.  Or something like that.
L:  It's like -- it's what her would be a non luxury hotel.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  So there you go.  I -- I -- no matter what happens she's not gonna have that much of a problem.
R:  But she ha- -- sh- -- well, the other place that this has been affecting her is in her pocketbook because she's lost all kinds of money.
L:  Yeah, but you know, it's like -- put it -- put it this way.  So she's got eight million.  Or, say, fifty [MN] -- not fifty, she probably has about, uh, twenty million, so she loses eight on this.  It's like us losing, uh, three thousand dollars.  It would be a lot of money but it wouldn't kill us either.
R:  Well, yeah, that's true too.  Yeah.  You mi- -- you hate to do that but it -- it --
L:  No, I mean, think about it.  
R:  You could survive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she will survive.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I know.  I know.  She -- she will.  She will.
R:  Yeah, well she's a pretty smart cookie really.  To have -- had her own business like that and to go -- you know, work it out to get to the position that she's in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So she's -- she's got some intelligence. 
L:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, she's -- she's not a dumb woman.  But also she's not gonna have dumb lawyers.  
R:  No.  She's gonna hire the best that she can get.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she can get the [LAUGH] best.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  Yeah, so she's got all that, oh -- well, I don't know how much she has now but she was -- she was at the billion mark.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But a- as far as now, with her stock dropping an- and everything, I have no idea where she's at now.
L:  Uh hm.  Mhm.  But I don't think that's a -- uh, put it this way.  Like I said, the equivalent -- somebody said it's equivalent to the normal person, uh, losing three thousand dollars.  Which is -- which is bad.  You'd, uh, be upset but it wouldn't take your house.
R:  Oh, no.  That --
L:  And it wouldn't --
R:  -- wouldn't take her possessions away.
L:  No.  So it's -- it's equivalent of that.  It's aggravation but it's not the worse thing that could ever happen.
R:  No.  No.  The humiliation I would think to her would be --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the worse thing.
L:  They said the humiliation of her getting fingerprinted and all.  I mean, that's what did it.  She was, uh, quite, uh, upset by that and -- and, uh, you know, she was treated like everyone else in that respect.
R:  Well, she had to be.  
L:  Yeah.  And she's probably, you know, she went and they probably took her through a back door somewhere and she came out and she had an umbrella o- on her head.  Who cares?
R:  So, you know ...
L:  I mean, I think there's a lot more in this world that's newsworthy than this.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I -- yeah, sometimes you know, I'll watch the national news to find out what's going on but, you know, sometimes I turn it over and watch C [MN] -- watch the Christian Broadcast News 'cause they [MN] tell it in a different perspective and they tell different things.  You know.
L:  Well, I -- I wouldn't be listening to that but if you like to that's ...
R:  Well, like I say, they give it a different perspective.  They don't always give everything on the national news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they don't always give other perspectives.
L:  Yeah.  No, I understand.  And, uh, I, um, [LIPSMACK] I would just hope that, uh, there's only a certain amount of media that is gonna be involved with this because it is kinda, uh, uh, boring to listen to this constantly.
R:  Well, you know, it's gonna go on until she goes to trial or if the trial's dropped or if they --
L:  Well, the trial could be an h- -- a -- a year from now.  
R:  Yeah, I know, talk [LAUGH] about it for years and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  It -- they won't drop it, you know.  They [MN] -- they just go on and on and on, you know, 'til it actually has to go away.
L:  Well, y- you know it's like, uh, that Conduit[?] or Con- Conwit[?], you know, that senator.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, that all died out because of, uh, uh, what was the one on that summer?  But anyway he -- it died out.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  When --
R:  It -- it died out 'cause another news story came in.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I forget what it was now.  But that's what they said.  They, uh, were able to, you know ...
R:  Yeah, that was sad that they found her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That was [MN] ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, he still could have something to do with it but who knows.
L:  Well, I don't [MN] you know, you never hear of that again.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's only a certain amount of, um, stuff that's, you know, certain amount of news that's go- going to be newsworthy for a certain amount of time.  
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  People get their fifteen minutes of fame.
L:  That's what they say.
R:  So ...
L:  That's what they say.  Yeah.  So this is the second time you've done this.  
R:  Yeah.  It -- this is kinda neat.  Yeah, you talk to people.  You [several inaudible words] out of state.  And, hey, easy money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it's like you register and, uh, uh, my sister did it, that's why I'm doing it.  So, um, you know, it's -- it gives you, uh, some, you know, pizza money I guess you could say.  
R:  Hey, you could always use some extra money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I tell you what with the economy the way it is.  I don't work outside the home.  I'm home with my two boys so this just --
L:  Mhm.  Well this helps you.
