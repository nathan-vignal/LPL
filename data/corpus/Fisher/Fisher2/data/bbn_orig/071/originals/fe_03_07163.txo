R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, this is, ah, my name's, ah -- hello.
L:  Yeah, hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Yeah, My -- I'm Lorraine.
L:  Hi, David.
R:  David, how're you doing?  Where you from -- calling from, David?
L:  I'm calling from, ah, New Jersey, how 'bout yourself?
R:  Ah, Delaware.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  Not far.  North or South Jersey?
L:  Ah, it's actually central Jersey, but --
R:  Central Jersey, okay.
L:  -- yeah, cl- -- pretty close to Trenton Bridgewater area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so, uh, what do you think about friends?
L:  Friends, the show?
R:  No, the, ah, topic, friends.
L:  Ah, oh, wait, isn't the topic outdoor activities?
R:  No, they -- they told me --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it was supposed to be --
L:  Oh, we both got different topics, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] We- -- friends, let's see.  Well, friends are important. [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess what they're asking is, um, like, three things, ah, do you have a few best friends --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- do you have a lot of best friends, or -- or, ah, do you have, ah, um, a variety, like, what kind of friends, I guess that's what they're asking.
L:  We- we- well, let's see.  I have a couple, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, n- not that many.  We actually moved, so lost touch with some of my friends --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I used to have -- I used to have a group of, ah, a group of friends I was, like, close to that -- like, none of them were actually my best friend.  Now I have a couple of best friends.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have one best friend but I haven't -- I have one, like, best, best friend, but I haven't seen him in a while --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause his wife passed away, so he's -- and he's further away so he hasn't been -- been travelling that much.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How 'bout yourself?
R:  Oh, I have -- I have lots of acquaintances.  I -- I know a lot of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people and stuff.  But I call [MN] maybe three or four people good friends, I mean, ah, I think they -- it was kinda good when they said, "Friends are people you can call up at three in the morning --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- and, ah, have a flat tyre somewhere and they'll come get ya".
L:  Yeah, that's true, well --
R:  Or they -- they -- not -- not -- maybe something more serious than that, but somebody you can call up at four in the morning and they're not going to hang up on you.
L:  [MN] That's true.  Well, it's always good where you live too, [LAUGH] 'cause everything's highway there, it seems like, so ...
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  But, yeah, I -- I mean -- yeah, I mean in [inaudible] I guess you don't have anything to bou- -- -body to bounce and you can't always bounce things off your family, so it's always good to have friends. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I just -- I think there's different --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- reasons why you talk to different people, I would think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, a lot of my friends know that, you know, I'm -- uh, they -- they -- they know me socially, my family doesn't know me though really socially.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean they -- I -- I see them and, um, but they know me as [NOISE] -- not so much as a, ah, a -- somebody that's going to party -- [MN], you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't party with my family --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- I -- what else can I say?
L:  That's true.  You're not going to go out and party with your family.  They -- they still think of you as, ah, as you from when you were little, going on ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, I -- I do like 'em, I -- I do have a lot of respect for my sisters and my brother, but it's not like I'm going to a club with them or anything.
L:  [MN] That's true. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] It's -- it's a lot different wh- -- that's -- that's very true, 'cause most of your -- I -- my brother and I are closer in age, so I guess more when we were younger we used to go out --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to clubs together, but I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, well, it's not like I don't go out to the movies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or something, but, um, [NOISE] um, I -- I just -- I guess I'm a little ol- -- I'm, like, nine years older than my brothers and sisters and so it's a little bit different.
L:  Yeah, me -- my brother and I are -- are -- are, like, less than two years apart, so it's not that big of a difference, but ...
R:  Mhm.  Do you think that -- this is interesting -- do you think, ah, guys have a --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- less of a -- a chance of meeting friends as women do?  Do you think men have less friends, like, personal friends?
L:  Y- you know, it's weird, 'cause men, you wind up being friends with your wife's friends or, you know, somebody's friends more than -- than I think women.  I think women make their own friends and then men [LAUGH] tag along.
R:  Oh, I think so.  I think -- so my brother had a hard time after his divorce, ah, he said he -- he had single friends, but, ah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they didn't sorta understand him --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- at this point and he had a lot of trouble meeting --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- other men that -- that was like him.
L:  Yeah, that's true, I mean, I [MN] y- you know, I have -- I have friends who are divorced and the ones who are divorced, if they, you know, they -- they've lost a lot of their friends that were, ah, you know, that -- that were friends with their wife, you know, they were mutual friends, because a lot of them first of all, the wife became friends with the other person's wife first --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then, you know, they became friends with the guys and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- it -- it became a choice for the guys --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and some of them said, "You know, hey, I don't care, I'm going to be friends with them anyway", but other ones said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "You know, if my wife's not, you know, if my wife's -- th- this is kinda awkward".
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] So ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't think women have that problem. 
R:  I don't think so either.  I think it's a completely different way of meeting and talking with people.
L:  That's true.
R:  I -- I mean it's just, um, I think guys are -- are afraid that someone's going to think they're either gay, you know, if they wanna have guy friends, or they're, ah, they're very needy or something.
L:  [MN] That's true, 'cause guys, like, you don't go -- you know, you don't say, "Hey --", you know, my wife always says that to me.  Like, "How come you can't ask Harry if he wants to go to, you know, um ...?" [LAUGH] What -- what's it -- we have friends and my wife's like, "How come you can't just, like, call him up and make plans with him?" and, you know  --
R:  Mm.
L:  "Why does -- why does it always have to be the wives making plans?" [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm like, "'Cause we're not going to do that".  Ah, no matter how much you say it, we're not going to do it.  It's just not gonna --
R:  No, I understand. 
L:  Yeah, I mean, I think women, you know, first of all, women are, like, I guess, more social naturally, I mean, it seems to me.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, you know, men are social in a different way.  Men when they are together will, like, drink together and, you know, talk sports, whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but not, you know, so I'll either call my mother -- my mo- -- you know, my mother never understood, like, with some of my friends, how, you know, especially when we were in college, we wouldn't talk to each other, like, the entire winter break --
R:  Really? [NOISE]
L:  -- and then we'd go back to school and we'd be like, you know, "Hey".  You know, 'cause, like, I had roommates -- well, I had two -- one of my roommates was from Buffalo --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one of my roommates was from Se- Syracuse and one of my roommates was from all the way out on the end of Long Island, like by the Hamptons.
R:  I see.
L:  So, you know, we didn't -- we didn't pick up the phone and call each other because, you know, you just don't.
R:  Mm.
L:  But then, you know, like, we'd be, like, go off to school and be hanging out, like, you know, best friends [LAUGH] so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, but then, you know, and then my mother's like, "How come, you know --" 'cause my cousin -- my -- my cousin went to school with me and she's, like, seeing all her frie- -- you know, she, like, drove up to Albany to see her roommates and whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] and she's like, "How come Sherry can do that and you ca- -- you -- you know, you can --"
R:  Oh yeah, no, I understand --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I understand, yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, it's a -- it's a different way of looking at, ah, ah, friendship and how, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ah, people will tend to get close to one another or not.
L:  [MN]
R:  Like, I -- I know when I was growing up I had, like, ten best girl friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, ah, we u- -- go -- go -- I -- with -- with guys growing up, like, when you were thirteen or fourteen did you have a goo- -- lot of friends?
L:  [MN]
R:  Or did you all, like, hang out like pack rats?
L:  It was like pack rats.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like more like that.  Like, you didn't, like, have, like -- I had, like I said, a couple of guys who I'd, like, call up on the phone and make plans with but mostly, like, everybody, like, hung out -- everybody, like, went to the same spot and, like, you know, maybe groups of guys would go off from there, like a different spot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I mean, usually it's, like, guys gravitate to -- like, guys will all go to the bowling alley on a certain night.  You never, like, called somebody up and say, "Hey, do you wanna go to the bowling alley?" [LAUGH] 
R:  They don't do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See and, like, women are, like -- are not like that at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all.  
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, we'll call and then by the time you call and find out who else is going, if you wanna go at all -- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] True.
R:  -- I mean, it's -- it's a different atmosphere.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I -- it's -- it's, you know, I, you know, when I got married, I saw that too, it's, like, you see, like, women, um, I mean, like my wife, she'll be, like, calling on the phone one of her friends --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it'll be, like, ta- take twenty days for going someplace --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, if I can't do this and I can't do that, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, like, I would be like, "Okay, well, call me back -- call me that --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- afternoon and we'll decide what we're doing".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, if they can't make plans or not to get together then they don't talk to each other for a week if they can't get together.
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, it's -- it's true, it's true.  So, the other topic we had about -- what was it, your topic?  It's activities?
L:  Oh, outdoor activities.  Do you -- do you like outdoor activities or indoor activities?
R:  Um, it depends.  I, ah -- it depends on the weather, like, I used to like out -- like, in the winter I used to like to do, ah, outdoor activities in the winter, but I hate the winter now, I really don't -- I really don't ski or anything.
L:  That was the other part of that topic, by the way, do you like winter or summer? [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah --
L:  Yeah, I -- I mean -- I -- I -- I personally now I like summer better too.  I -- I used to like -- when I used to ski before I hurt my knee.
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- you know, I -- I hurt my knee playing football.  I used to ski and I can't, like, cuts -- it's -- skiing is just no fun, 'cause I can't cut the way I used to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it's, like, you know, heading for -- if I'm heading straight for a tree, [LAUGH] I'm dead. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, they were saying that -- I don't know how old you are but, ah, if you're -- if you have a career and, ah, you, um, need money you don't wanna spend the eight weeks it takes for a -- a leg to heal.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- ah, there's a -- the only people right now are skiing are very young people, very young, you know, like --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- in the -- before twenty or before twenty five, or you get maybe some very physically fit perfect people.
L:  And then older -- and then older people start skiing again, yeah.
R:  Well, maybe, yeah.
L:  But I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I -- I -- yeah, I -- I used to love it, but, you know, I -- I mean, I like the warm weather, 'cause I like to swim and stuff like that.  Like, we're going to -- like, we're going to Vegas.  I mean, that's a little too hot, but, you know, I wo- -- I would rather, like, go by -- go by the pool or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but [LAUGH] then at this point in time [LAUGH].
R:  Nah, winter sports, like even, ah, ah, [MN] -- for some reason I went with a friend to Iceland a few years -- a few weeks ago actually and [MN] -- end of April --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
R:  -- and, ah, they had these, um, things where you can get in these big trucks and go over the tundra and all that stuff and I wasn't interested.  You see one piece of --
