L:  This is Paula.
R:  Hi.  I'm Marion.
L:  [NOISE]  I'm sorry?
R:  I'm Marion.
L:  [NOISE]  Marion.  Hello.  'Scuse me.  
R:  Hello.
L:  Sorry about that.  [NOISE]  So I think the discussion is regarding the scandals in the stock market?
R:  I didn't --
L:  I --
R:  -- understand what she [LAUGH] said.
L:  Yeah, I didn't hear all the questions either.  But I believe it's regarding the corporate scandals that are going on and what can the government do to prevent some of that.  And how -- +how -- how we've been affected by some of those scandals.  And it's kind of perfect timing with the whole Martha Stewart thing going on.
R:  Right.
L:  Right now.  
R:  That's for sure.  That was a surprise.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, unless you -- do you have any thoughts in that area?
R:  Well, I don't know what they can do to stop it.  That I for sure.  It would --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be kind of hard to do, I think.  But it's been getting worse all the time.
L:  Yeah.  It has been getting worse all the time and -- and, you know, I like to think that auditing or having some kind of regular audits would work but then when you look at these firms that are doing the auditing, they're the ones that are often, um, [COUGH] 'scuse me, that have been, you know, mis- misrepresenting the information.
R:  Right.
L:  So ... And I -- and I'm not, you know, I'd hate to have another government agency created to go out and audit these firms, because that seems like a -- a waste of money and yet, at the same time, I don't want to see repeated incidences of Enron and things like that, because I think ultimately -- ultimately, a lot more people than just the employees of Enron or Martha Stewart's stocks get affected.  I mean, I think that it affects the whole confidence people have in the overall, um, stock market and I think when you [MN] -- peo- -- that if -- when their confidence is affected then they are, you know, it -- it discourages them from doing any future investments and thereby affecting, you know, beginning a whole trend of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, hurting --
R:  Right.  
L:  -- the economy.  
R:  It's just an endless circle.  
L:  Yeah, exactly.  And what's your thoughts with regards to having more government inter- you know, intervention or -- or trying to get the government more involved with trying to curb some of that?
R:  Well, I think they should.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They need to do-- do something and I'm -- I don't know of anybody else that can do it either so ...
L:  Right.
R:  I think it's time they start, uh, checking a little closer on -- on some of the bigger people and let the peons [LAUGH] alone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, sometimes I think that maybe if they had like a, you know, they have the -- the, um, whistle blower protection.  You know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Sometimes I think that maybe if there was -- if there was -- actually the people that are -- the people that are internal to the organisation are the ones that really know what's going on in any kind of government.  Any time you hear about an organization who's, you know, f- -- uh, um, secrets have been let out the -- as a result of their finance it's generally, like, someone from the finance department that decides to fess up or gets, uh, busted, you know.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So I often think that maybe if they did more to encourage whistle blowers to come out and, like, maybe pay them or incent[?] them or something.  That might get people internally to do it.  I'm not sure, you know.  What --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- do you think?
R:  Yeah.  It's, uh, difficult to -- to know which person would -- would be able to -- maybe more internal audits, I -- or outside audits of different things.  I don't know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they need to be watched closer somehow or other.  
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, I think, maybe like you said, the fact that, you know, it's [MN] making a [MN] an +external audit and having it be a third party and someone who is not involved, you know.  Because, like, these Arthur Andersen's and these other organizations that were doing those audits, they were being paid by the company to do the audit, you know.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, of course, that, you know, the -- you -- you -- what -- what's that expression?  You don't bite the mouth -- the hand that feeds you, or something.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Right.  There needs --
L:  So ...
R:  -- to be somebody completely no connection to them, I would say.  
L:  Yeah.  But, it -- it definitely -- I mean, overall I think what would [MN] the other way it's affected me is that I just don't -- I have -- I just don't trust anybody anymore.  It just [LAUGH] reinforces my lack of trust, you know.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  At first the President's lying and then -- and like [MN] with Martha Stewart, in particular, she -- what blows my mind is that she was actually on the, um, stock exchange.  On the board of directors.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, so she --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- supposed to be the one that was kinda regulating the board of directors or the one that was, uh, not regulating, but I mean, participating --
R:  Mm, right.
L:  -- in the sense that was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- guiding the direction of the stock market and here she was --
R:  Involved herself.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  So ...  It definitely is, uh, discouraging.  
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  I don't think it's affe- -- I mean, I think that's probably the biggest way it's affected me personally, is that I just -- just continuous lack of confidence in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- these individuals.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a lot more suspicion, you know.  
R:  Well, and in this day and age there's not a whole lot of people you can trust anywhere.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  That's part of the problem too.  Everybody's out for all they can get and they don't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- care who was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was hurt in the meantime.
L:  I don't know when that happened.  I kind of feel like it just kind of happened now but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know like when my parents were growing up and even -- I mean, I'm only thirty five but when I was growing up it was like that as well.  I mean, you know, it just seemed a little bit more, uh, honest [LAUGH] world.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Maybe -- I mean -- I mean, maybe part of that was then there w- -- there seemed to be ramifications for actions so maybe now that, you know, th- that the S.E.C. and the government's coming down on these guys there are ramifications for their actions.  So maybe that will curb future behaviour.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Ho- hopefully that -- most of the time there isn't -- isn't enough consequences.  I mean, little slap on the fingers and that's all we get.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, the other thing it's kind of interesting, like I was reading an article about the Martha Stewart situation today and it said in there that, you know, she is not -- they're not going after her for the st- -- the trading as --
R:  Right.
L:  -- much as they are for the lying.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and for impeding the investigation.  And I kind -- I -- I like that because I like the idea that [MN] they're reinforcing that you can't get away with every little thing, you know.
R:  Yeah, right.  
L:  Y- you are --
R:  Right.
L:  -- gonna get busted if you screw with the government when they're interviewing you and stuff.
R:  Well, that's for sure.  Most people ought to -- I mean, people ought to be able to figure out pretty soon that one lie just leads to another and pretty soon you're gonna get caught in your own trap somewhere along the line.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  
R:  At least I would.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I [MN] -- I already have been in my life so I know.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  You know.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.  
L:  Now do you -- like would you, as a result of what's been going on, have you changed, like your retirement plans or your 401K or anything like that?
R:  Uh, no I haven't.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  No.  
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  I --
L:  -- I haven't really made many changes either but I -- I -- I always think about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- those Enron employees.  Like especially --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people who were close to retirement and lost everything.  You know.
R:  Right.  Right.  I just have, um, I.R.A.  That's all I've got.  [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, that's the safest.
R:  [LAUGH]  In my own savings or CDs or [LAUGH] whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  
R:  [LAUGH]  But ...
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  You don't -- you don't know what to put it in.  I don't understand most of it to start with and I'd sure put it in something stupid.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well it's kinda hard to know.  I mean, there's way -- there's so many options out there and -- and you become even more suspicious, you know, when you hear about these other things happening, so ...
R:  Yeah, right.  Right.
L:  It's tough.  I think it's really hard to make those kind of decisions and you also -- I th- -- also think you -- you hear about, you know, firms, +reputable firms, like Arthur Andersen.  Those other big firms that you thought you could trust and you realize, you know, you can't trust --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- them either.
R:  Yep.  Right.  Right.
L:  So, I mean, maybe one of the results then is kind of, uh, you know, [MN] uh, fewer investments.  You know, people [MN] keeping more in cash in IRAs and things like that as opposed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to the market.
R:  Yeah, right.  
L:  But, yeah, I'm not sure.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I know it's, uh, difficult.  Retiring used to be lo- -- something to look forward to.  Now I'd hate to think of it because you -- you got to have this in order and that in order and the next thing in [LAUGH] order.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, even --
R:  [LAUGH]  You can't even retire in peace anymore.
L:  I -- exactly.  I mean, like I said, I'm thirty five and my husband and I go to the, you know, trying to get some plans, like what we need.  And, like my gosh, we're never gonna be able to [LAUGH] stop working.
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.  
L:  I mean there -- [MN] it's almost you -- I mean, I always think that we live conservatively but you get the feeling when you talk about retirement like you'll never have enough.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  You know.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  I definitely find that kind of frustrating and overwhelming.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At times a lot.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, that's right.  
L:  Not really sure what else you can do though other than just keep trying to save it and ...
R:  Well, yeah, right.
L:  Y- you know and n- not look for that [inaudible] big bang.
R:  And sometimes you wonder why because other people don't bother and they live just as good as you do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  The other thing I was gonna say I thought was interesting about the whole Martha situation is that she only made, like, two hundred thousand dollars in that deal.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she could have -- I mean, and -- I mean, that's a lot of money for us but for her --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- that's not --
R:  Right.  Drop in the bucket.  
L:  Yeah, exactly.  It was kind of like a drop in the +bucket -- bucket for her.  And like what a waste.  You know, just because of that one deal.  I mean, you know she had -- I read too today she quit her job or her -- you know, she stepped down her job -- stepped down from her C.E.O. position and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  Go to jail and ...  It's just a vicious circle like you had said before.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  So ... 
R:  Yeah, I, uh -- so where are you from?
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.  How 'bout yourself?
R:  I'm in, uh, Minnesota.  
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  Little teeny town. 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?  What's it called?
R:  Sandborne[?]?
L:  Sandborne.  I just talked to someone today from Hutchingson[?]. 
R:  Oh.  Well, that's not too far from here.
L:  Yeah.  He -- I -- I do sales and he was o- one of my -- one of my prospects [NOISE] -- prospective clients --
R:  Oh.  
L:  -- who lives in Hutchingson.  [NOISE] You know, they're [NOISE] based there.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It's a -- it's a soy and a seed company.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and they're -- they're tal- -- [MN] I sell software and they were thinking about buying this [NOISE] software system.  And they were saying, you know, we [MN] you need to come out here and do your demo.  And I said, okay, well, I don't -- I did it on the phone today, I said I'll come out there now that I know it's June, July, August.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  It's about an hour away from here.  
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
R:  That's [LAUGH] interesting.
L:  Oh, neat.  [NOISE]
R:  Um ...
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, I haven't really -- I've only been to Minne- Minneapolis.  I really haven't been outs- you know, outside that area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Beyond that, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd love to.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, we -- we only got about three hundred, three hundred and fifty people in the town where I live now.  It used to be over five hundred though.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Why have everyb- why is everybody leaving?
R:  Well, there's nothing here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?  What was there --
R:  No.
L:  -- before that kept them there?
R:  Well, they, um, had a lot, you know, you had a lot of younger families with kids and everything and now we have no school here and so, um, there's just nothing to -- to intone[?] anymore.  The post office and a bar and all the --
L:  Oh, the school closed?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just 'cause there's not enough enrollment?
