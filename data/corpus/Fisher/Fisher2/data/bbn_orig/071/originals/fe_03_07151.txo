L:  Hi, my name's Barbara.
R:  Hi, my name's Jim.
L:  Well, how you doing, Jim?
R:  [NOISE] Just fine.  How you doing tonight?
L:  Oh, I'm okay.
R:  So, the topic is outdoors?
L:  Or --
R:  Indoor.
L:  -- -doors.  Or hot weather or cold weather.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That kinda goes without [MN] saying.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Ah --
L:  Ah --
R:  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
L:  Actually I prefer, uh -- I think I prefer ho- -- cold weather.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  And why is this?
L:  I like cold weather because, um, when the heat, like, actually, like, in the summertime and stuff like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when the heat gets to, like, ninety to, like, a hundred degrees, it's like -- it messes with my breathing.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I see.
L:  A- and it -- sometimes the air --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- is dry where I live at, 'cause I live in D.C.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And the air is so dry that --
R:  Really?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  Like, when it gets to a hundred degrees and stuff like that, it's so dry up here that you can't even breathe.  So, that's why I like -- like cold weather the best. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I would have to say for me it'd be the warm weather.  Uh, [SIGH] and it's probably not the best time to be asking this question 'cause I don't know what I would answer normally but, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we've had a lot of rain here in Jersey where I'm at.
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN] I'm new here --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, uh, gotten, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very few sunny days so far so I'm kinda craving it right now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'd have to say that, uh, right now probably sun just 'cause it hasn't been that way very much.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, and -- and it all depends, too.  Uh, last year when we first got here round the Fourth of July it was, uh, very humid.  We ca- -- we were in, uh, Florida for a year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it everybody's telling you, saying how great it is up here.  [SIGH] And, uh, we got up here and as far as I'm concerned it was hotter and more humid up here than it was down in Florida when we were there so ...
L:  [LIPSMACK] Ah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, hopefully that's not gonna be the case this year or I doubt, though, that, uh, uh, I'll be able to see a normal season around here 'cause it seems that, uh, it hasn't been.  But, you know, I like doing some things outside.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There's, uh, um ... I haven't gone camping for quite a while, but, uh, I always used to enjoy that.  Play golf now and then.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh ... [SIGH] But indoors has its own thing.  I like playing with my computer so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, and my cats.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, you said on campus, you're not in college, are you?
R:  No, no.  Um --
L:  Oh, oh, okay.
R:  I'm over here by, uh, Princeton --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- University so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It, uh, it's nice around here.  Unfortunately the weather hasn't been so ... [SIGH] And, uh, I guess also it depends on whether -- ah, what the weather's like whether I like indoor better [LAUGH] or outdoor doing stuff, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, some -- some stuff I like, um, like, in the summer, just depends.  Like, for instance, maybe, like, um, barbecuing --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that.  Um, sw- swimming, going swimming.  And actually now, um, 'cause it's not what you call hot up here right now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to be June.  It's like sometimes sixty eight degrees, which is kinda cool.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm walking a lot more now.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Because I used to didn't walk, so I see myself walking more so, yeah.  And then I'm like a more -- I -- I see myself as more a indoor person 'cause, um, I -- I usually be on my computer too.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Actually, yeah, on the Internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just, like, researching stuff.  Not, like, chatting and stuff like that.  'Cause I -- I really don't know how to use the computer.
R:  Right.
L:  But only just the Internet part, that's the only part I know how to use.  But right now I done did something to it that I really don't even know what's wrong with it. [LIPSMACK] So I haven't been on there for, like, a coupla weeks.  So ...
R:  Oh, the way to learn is to actually, uh, keep playing with it and, uh, making your mistakes and, uh, learning from those, basically.  I mean, your main thing is getting over the fear of it.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I -- I like using the Internet, too.  Um, I do it at work --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because of, uh, the type of business that we're in there.  But, uh, my girlfriend and I just started up a, uh, pet gift basket business, too --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and so I like, uh, like playing around with that, learning how to, uh, change the website and --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] waiting for the first order to come in.  But, you know, it's slow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Getting the site promoted is a lot of it, you know, getting the word out.  And, uh, getting our -- our business set up on the search engines.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, I -- I would say I -- I used to be more of an outdoor person, I used to ride a bike and, uh, walk and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- go camping, as I said, and things like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, now we walk if the weather's nice.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, and when it's not raining we're out walking.  Uh, otherwise --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mainly, uh, believe it or not I like to shop.
L:  Really?
R:  So, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh, even if we go outside it's generally going inside, uh, to a store so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- um, you know, we, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- haven't been able to see too much of, uh, the area around here because of the weather and all.  So, most of our time is spent indoors.
L:  Oh, okay.  And you mentioned something about camping. [NOISE] I haven't been camping in, oh goodness, about [MN], about twenty years.  And when --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- when I first went camping, I loved that experience.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I would like to do something like that.  Even, um, fishing.  I've never been fishing but I've heard that people that went fishing, they enjoy it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I would be open to that experience.
R:  I did quite a bit of it, uh, when I was down in Florida.  I hadn't done it for many years but I'd heard about how big the fish were down there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, yeah, so I spent a lot of time fishing down there.  I was outdoors quite a bit --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- outdoors because of that.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I'd say it's been about that long for me for camping.  I'm originally from California and I was not --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I was not too far from, uh, Yosemite and Sequoia and some of the other national parks like that so --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- uh, it -- I really enjoyed it.  It was beautiful.  We'd always go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to Yosemite [inaudible] try to make it whenever I could.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I lived for a while in the Bay area and, uh, of course, when you're there --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you've gotta, uh --
L:  What part of Florida, um, were you in?
R:  West Palm Beach.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  I went, um, to this place called Kissimmee.
R:  Yeah, Kissimmee, yeah, exactly.
L:  Okay.  Um, I think it was like a couple of miles from Orlando.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because that's where I had went to, um, [LIPSMACK] Disney World last year --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in February.  And I just -- I -- I stayed there, like, two days just to, you know, go to the park.  And it was very nice down there.
R:  The whole time we planned on going there, we never did make it -- make it there.  So, we're --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we, uh, may be moving to, uh, Massachusetts very soon, Boston as a matter of fact, um, [SIGH] for work and, uh, we're hoping that maybe we can take the time to eventually make it back down into Florida.  We -- we really do wanna go back down there and live again --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because we enjoyed it so much but --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- one of the places she worked for when we were down there had an account with Disney and she had just gotten set up as being account manager for it, to go visit the park and do -- do business with them when the, uh, owner of the business, who was originally here from -- from New Jersey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, decided he was gonna move it all back up here.  So, we never did get the chance to go see, uh, Disney World, I guess, is what the name of it is.
L:  [MN]
R:  I guess I've been -- probably the whole time I lived in California I was -- I went to Disneyland itself probably about thirteen times so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, it was a thing we used to do every -- every year.  My dad was the one that got us started in camping.  We'd always go camping.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And he also got us into fishing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And probably was the one to really got me to enjoy the outdoors.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But unfortunately since growing up and having to take on responsibilities and all, just haven't had really the ability to be able to go and enjoy myself as much as I'd like to.  So ...
L:  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  Gotta work, work, work.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Me, I'm, um, I'm trying to like, um, [LIPSMACK] -- actually I like to write, I -- I like to do creative writing and I'm actually looking into, like, a school --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that, um, teaches, um, [LIPSMACK] writing.  'Cause, um, they -- I -- I like poetry but this is like, um, writing, like, what, like children's books and teenage books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've never done it before.
R:  Really?
L:  No, I never -- I never done that before.  So this was -- it's gonna be like a challenge.  Seem like it would be hard because, um, my -- my main focus is on mainly poetry.
R:  Right.
L:  So, wh- when -- when it was, like, the challenge to write a -- like a -- a kid's book, it -- it -- it looked like just kinda hard for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, there's a place -- you say you like the Internet, there's a place that you can go and, uh, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- test your writing, I guess is what you'd say.  A lot of people go there and, uh, just put down their thoughts and stuff.  It's a place on the Internet called open diary --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- dot com.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, actually that's -- [inaudible] my girlfriend used to do a lot of writing and she'd go and, uh, put it on there, and people gotta leave comments, uh, go- -- you can -- you can make the choice whether you can allow people who -- to, uh, make negative comments [MN] or only just positive or both.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, you know, you can put, uh, some of your ideas down there and let people read 'em and have 'em, uh, critique how, uh, the -- the, uh -- what they think about your work.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You need to check it out.
L:  That's -- [LAUGH] well, thank you for that information.
R:  No problem.
L:  Thanks.
R:  It, uh -- I used to, uh, when I had, uh, things I needed to get out, I'd go there and write.  I haven't been there for quite a while but it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh, [SIGH] a nice place for, uh, you to go and -- and be nameless and yet put down your thoughts and your ideas and your stories and, uh, you know, your, uh, happenings.  Uh, whether you wanna do it every day or not, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's, uh, just a good place to be able to, uh, you know, get some practice in if anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I would suggest going there and, uh, plying your wares and seeing what people have to say about it.
L:  Okay. [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But ... yeah, I'd say I -- I've gone from being mo- -- [MN] an outdoors person to more indoors just because of, uh, like I say, responsibilities, time, things like that.  They all play a factor in it.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, money, times --
