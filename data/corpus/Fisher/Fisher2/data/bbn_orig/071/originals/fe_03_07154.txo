R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE] Uh, who's this?
L:  My name is Tina.
R:  Hi, Tina.  My name's Todd.
L:  Hi, Todd.
R:  [NOISE] How are ya? [NOISE]
L:  Good, good. [LAUGH]
R:  So, which do you like better?
L:  I like, um, outside activities, and I like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the warm weather.
R:  Oh, really?  Why is that?
L:  [MN] Um, [LIPSMACK] there's just a lot more to do when it's warmer outside.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I like, you know, rollerblading and basketball, tennis, and you can't really do that when it's cold outside.
R:  Yeah, I guess.  But what about skiing, snow skiing?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah, that's fun, too.  However, I'm not very good at skiing.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I grew up on skis.
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like snowboarding and stuff like that?
R:  Yeah, snow skiing and snowboarding.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I tried -- I don't snowboard very often but I tried it and I hurt my butt last time I went.
L:  Nice.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, did that traumatize you?
R:  Uh, no.  I would do it again.
L:  Hm.
R:  I was gonna go this year but I -- I didn't have time.
L:  Where do you us- usually go?
R:  Uh, well, I -- I live, uh, in Southern California.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So I've been going, like, different parts in California.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  Yeah.  But, uh, it's -- I don't know if I prefer outdoor -- I mean, I prefer outdoor sports, but I don't know if I prefer --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- uh, outdoor activities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but as far as warm weather versus cold weather --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I like ... I like cold weather better because I'm -- I'm a skier.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And I love skiing, but there are -- you're right, there are more warm weather activities to do.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I'm a big tennis player.
L:  Mm.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, I'm not -- I enjoy them all.  I'm not necessarily good at any of them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I -- I just play for fun, not really for competition reasons.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So, but it --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- they are a lot of fun.
R:  Right.  What -- what part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in Chicago.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, Chicago gets cold.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we don't really have any, you know, ski resorts [MN], like, really close by.  We'd have to do some traveling.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So that's why, um, [MN] we're not really into skiing down here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, there aren't -- there aren't a lot of mountains.
L:  Mhm.  [inaudible]
R:  I've been to the moun- -- I've been to some mountains up by, uh, Wisconsin.
L:  Right, that's actually --
R:  But --
L:  -- where we would have to go.
R:  But they're not very good.
L:  Oh, good to know.
R:  Yeah, they're not very good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've been to the Rockies, that's where I go skiing.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  And I'm -- I'm spoiled with the, uh, Southern California weather.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Mm.
R:  Maybe that's why I -- I like cold weather sports [LAUGH] or cold weather activities better.
L:  Right.  As opposed to us, we -- it almost -- there's almost more cold times here than warm.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, when it gets warm outside everyone wants to run and take advantage.
R:  Right.
L:  Mm.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Um, you wouldn't happen to know how long this conversation needs to go, do you?
R:  Uh, ten minutes.
L:  Oh, ten minutes?
R:  Only ten minutes, yeah.  We're almost --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's almost done. [SIGH]
L:  I mean, I'm enjoying it, don't get me wrong, just curious.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is Ch- -- uh, Chicago -- do you -- do you, uh, do sailing or anything like that on the lake?
L:  Um, [SIGH] yeah.
R:  Or boating, like boating?
L:  A lot of that going on.
R:  What?
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of that going on this time of year.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, and that's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah, you guys have some nice parks there, too --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to do some activities.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're -- I mean ... unfortunately I don't take much advantage of it.
R:  Of the parks?
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible]
R:  Do you live in -- what?
L:  No, I -- I live in the city.  I live close to all that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But we just -- I guess we take it for granted.
R:  Right.
L:  And we don't go.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I have friends in the suburbs and, yeah, we go to the parks in the suburbs and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's some nice golf courses I've heard around there.
L:  Mm.
R:  Do those kinds of activities.
L:  I've been, um, I've been golfing before but not here.  Like, wh- when I go away on vacation. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's when we -- we do all that stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  But yeah, we do have some [NOISE] -- some nice golf course here.
R:  Where do you go vacationing?
L:  Um, [SIGH] usually or lately it's been Florida.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's -- you know, I've gone, like, for the past three years.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what do you do in Florida?
L:  Well, I have family down there that I go visit.
R:  Right, everyone has family there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, what ki- -- what kinds of activities do you do?
L:  Um, we just basically hit the amusement parks.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, Islands of Adventure and [NOISE] all that other good stuff.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.  And the beaches and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, the beaches are nice.
L:  Yeah.  Unfortunately I haven't gone to a really nice one.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.
R:  The ones in California are nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they're very nice.  Although the ones in, uh, the beaches in Florida are -- are pretty nice, too.
L:  Mm.
R:  But actually the ones -- the beaches in, like, the Carribean, if you go to the Carribean islands --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- I think those are the nicest.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I've been --
R:  And they [inaudible] there's always activities on the beaches there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've -- I've never tried, um, [LIPSMACK] um, you know, like [NOISE] scuba diving or something like that, but that's definitely something that I wanna -- I wanna do.
R:  Right.  I've tried snorkeling.
L:  Yeah?
R:  And, yeah, scuba diving is great.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  That's what I hear.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  But they --
R:  And sailing, I -- I'm a big sailor.
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah.  And boating, anything with boats.
L:  You know, I get seasick.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I've been on a boat a few times and I don't know, maybe it's 'cause I -- I don't go on the boat too often.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I guess [NOISE] if I did go often enough maybe that would go away.
R:  Huh.
L:  But I do get a little queasy.
R:  Yeah.  From -- from all the up and downs.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you like roller coasters, though?
L:  I do.
R:  But -- and you don't get sick on roller coasters?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  No.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Huh.
L:  I guess maybe it's just the constant, you know, ups and downs.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um ...
R:  What about horseback riding?  You ever do that?
L:  Oh -- oh, yeah, I love -- love horses.
R:  I've -- yeah, I love doing that.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  But yeah, I was getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my butt was getting sore from that. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I haven't gone in a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But yeah --
R:  Can you go horseback riding in Chicago?
L:  [PAUSE] [inaudible] uh, yeah, I -- I love -- I love horseback riding.  And it's cool 'cause you -- you don't necessarily have to do it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when it's hot outside.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.
L:  You can, you know, like around the fall time and stuff, it's perfect --
R:  Right.
L:  -- perfect time to go.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.  'Cause the horses don't get, you know, as exhausted with the heat and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I saw, uh, the most interesting thing, I saw horses -- horseback riding through the ocean.
L:  Wow.  Where at?
R:  Uh, it was in some country, I don't -- some foreign country.  But it was on --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, it was on E Entertainment.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And yeah, Brooke Burke was going horseback riding through the ocean, so, like, the ocean was, like, up to, like, the horse's, like, back.  And --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you're -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  It was weird.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  [NOISE] So ...
L:  I know I've seen a commercial, like, you know, that people are horseback riding but they're on the sand.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, they're close to the ocean but they're not in the ocean.
R:  [LAUGH] Right, right. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Mm, interesting.  Interest- -- I wonder if that's harder on the horse?
R:  Mm, could be.
L:  Or if he just --
R:  Hard to --
L:  -- kinda floats.
