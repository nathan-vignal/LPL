R:  [PAUSE] [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Kathy.
L:  I'm Bill.
R:  Okay.
L:  Pleased to talk to you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I we're supposed to be talking about our best friends, huh?
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, my best friend I've known for about thirty years.
R:  Okay.
L:  I met him when I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hired him to work for me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he's the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- only person --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who ever worked for me that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I could socialize -- that they didn't try to take advantage of it at work.
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, it's like, normally I would shy -- I shied away from those kind of relationships, but --
R:  Sure.
L:   -- this individual just -- there was something special in him and you could just see it.
R:  Hm.
L:  And, ah, we've been friends ever since.
R:  Wow.
L:  Ah, even though we've parted the jobs and gone our different ways --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and everything.  But, ah, he's always been somebody I could call -- talk to -- anything with -- and ah, get some good answers and some good insights.
R:  Oh, yep.  That's always helpful.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and when we see each other or talk on the phone it's like we were together yesterday.
R:  Hm.  Wow, that's nice.
L:  Yeah, it's a terrific relationship.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I -- I only have a few close friends like that.  Most --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people -- most people are acquaintances.
R:  Yep.
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay.  Well, I -- um, I have a few, um, friends.  Not a best friend at this point.  Um, my best friend actually -- if you're familiar with this word -- in my opinion she actually dissed me. [LAUGH]  Do you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what that means?
L:  Oh yes.
R:  Okay.  Well, you know, we had known each other since -- and I'm for- -- almost forty.  But, we had known each other since middle school.  We weren't really -- I mean, we were friends for a year in middle school.  Then during high school we kind of grew apart.  And then we happened to get reacquainted, ah, after high school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the scenario is that she -- and we both live in the same city -- village really, and her parents live two houses away from me.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, you know, I had seen her around the village.  And so then we started getting friendly again.  And I really considered her really my best friend. [NOISE]  And -- but for some reason she couldn't -- she couldn't tell me that I was hers, even though I know she doesn't have a lot of friends.  She mainly had her mom and her sister.  She just could not do that.
L:  Hm.
R:  And then, um, this was almost four years ago already -- um, ah, my mom had died.  And instead of staying at the funeral home she brought me a check in an envelope.  And she brought it up to me and she left right away.  And, you know, I -- I didn't think too much about it at the time.  But then, as things progressed she did that a lot. [NOISE]  She -- you know, she would never be available to go [NOISE] out for lunch or anything.  I mean, I realise she's busy.  She's got a much [NOISE] busier life than I do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I still feel like, you know, if you wanna keep a friend you've gotta do -- you know, you gotta at least make time for them -- a little bit of time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- ugh, so, you know, I'd ask her for lunch and she wouldn't wanna go -- "Oh, I've gotta do this or that".  And then, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, I'm trying to think -- okay.  Well, the other part of our relationship -- and I'm gonna get to the kicker in a minute -- but, the other part of our relationship was, you know, we would call each, like, three or four -- five times a week.  And we would talk to each other for about a half hour at a crack sometimes.  So, I could tell over the past couple of years -- I could tell that the phone calls were really dwindling down, at least from her end.  I would still call her, but she would hardly ever call me.  But, she used to always seem fairly happy to talk to me.  Um, but anyway, finally this past December I said to myself, "Well, you know what?  I'm not gonna call her.  I'm gonna see if she calls me". [NOISE]  Well, guess what?  She's called me once since then. [NOISE]  Okay, bye.  And she knows that I'm mad at her --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [NOISE] um, because of something else that happened.  But, let me tell you the kicker.  Okay, my husband and I were a Super Bowl party in January -- and this is at the end of December.  We were at their house for dinner, 'cause we would do -- we do holiday with them and their kids, and out kids.  So, I said to her -- I said, "Lisa, you know, we're having" -- or actually my husband said to her, "Lisa, we're having a Super Bowl party.  You know, we'd really like you guys to come".  She says to us, "I'll send Mike".  That's her husband.  This is how she said it.  She said, "I send Mike".  I mean, to me, that is the rudest thing.  I mean, I know she's antisocial but, [NOISE] you know, you'd [NOISE] think she'd wanna support me.  We had a really big, nice party.  And you'd think she'd wanna say, "Oh yeah, I'd love to come, have something to eat, you know and stay for a little while. I know -- and I'm not big on some of your friends"  -- and she really isn't -- "But, I'll some anyway".  And, you know -- and it just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that hurt me so much.  And so, I decided then and there that I was not really having anything to do with her anymore.  So then, you know, I've seen her around a couple of times.  We've said hello.  [LIPSMACK] And then I saw her at my son's piano recital, 'cause her daughter takes piano lessons also.  And, um, I would not talk to her.  But, of course my husband is so nice and so friendly that he was talking to all of them.  And I just wouldn't talk to her.  And she finally [NOISE] realised.  And this was in May or the end of April.  So, then she realised.  'Cause I saw her the next day. [NOISE]  We [NOISE] -- we actually passed in our vans 'cause she was coming over by her mom's house.  And she wouldn't look at me.  And I could tell that, you know, she knew what was up finally.  So, we haven't really -- you know, we haven't talked to each other.  And I -- and else gets me is that she hasn't called me to say, "What's going on?"  You know?  Or, "What --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- did I do?"  So, that my story, and it's -- I mean, maybe I'm in wrong, but I really don't think I am.
L:  I know from my own --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- experience she -- ah, it could be something in -- in her background, and way she was raised, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, what she's learned about relationships from --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- her parents.
R:  [NOISE] Sure.  Mhm.
L:  I mean, my -- my dad was in the service.  We --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- moved all --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- over the country constantly.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And he had a few friends, but he never -- once he left -- moved on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he never retained his relationships.  
R:  Sure.
L:  Relationships with family, yes.  But outside of that, you know, he --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he just didn't maintain it.
R:  Yep.
L:  And I found myself growing up being the same way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that once I moved to another school -- kids would give me their addresses. [MN]  I didn't make any effort.
R:  Right.  Usually kids will not do that.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then when I met my friend Carl, ah, like I said, there was just something different.  And I've had that experience with a couple of people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, not to any great extent.  But, I also know it's the environment I was raised in -- was not one where you maintained relationships.
R:  Sure -- sure.
L:  And that could be -- you know, it could just be a learned experience --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for her.
R:  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, I -- I really don't know, you know, why she really isn't trying to continue with the relationship, or why she treated me like that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I really don't know.  But, you know, my husband's been saying to me, "You know, you should call her and you should talk to her".  But, I don't feel like I -- that's it's m- my turn to do anything.
L:  Right.
R:  I think it's her -- her turn to do it.  So, I don't know.  But, oh well.  So, now a good friendship down --
L:  Or if --
R:  -- the tubes.
L:  Or if you can get a hold of her and just sit down discuss in earnest with her how you feel and try to find out why.
R:  Right. I w- -- in a way I want to do that, but in another way I really have no desire to even talk to her at this point.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know.  But, I know I should.
L:  Could just be anger defence mechanism.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm sure some of my friends have been angry -- or acquaintance have been angry with me over the years when I didn't call back --
R: Uh-huh.
L: -- or -- or write, or -- well, I've never done much of that in my --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- lifetime.  It, um -- I'm great with people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- put myself into a lot of social events.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  And she just might be the same way.
R:  Yeah, it's very --
L:  It was the way --
R:  -- possible.
L:  -- to be brought -- that she was brought up with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family.  Another --
R:  And I think you could be right --
L:  Another --
R:  -- that way.
L:  -- that is -- passing ships.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As you said, her mother and her sister and --
R:  Yep, that's basically what it is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It could be --
R:  So --
L:  -- just a learned reflex.  The only thing that, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- helped me become better friend with people -- ah, attuned to 'em was when I went back to school and took some psychology classes.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, ah, of course in there you get into things like associations and relationships --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and listening and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Okay. 
L:  And, ah, yeah, without that I may have gone through the rest of my life without ever having a friend.
R:  Right. True. [LIPSMACK]
L:  So, you -- you might wanna just talk to her if you get the opportunity.
R:  Yeah.  I probably should.
L:  But --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's all right to have your anger too.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you think so?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Okay, that's good.
L:  As long as you don't hang onto it. 
R:  Right.  Well, you know, at the beginning, um, I thought about it a lot.  And now I don't think about it nearly as mu- --
