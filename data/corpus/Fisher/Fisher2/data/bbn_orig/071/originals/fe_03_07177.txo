L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, I'm Marcia.
L:  Hi, I'm Tania.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I haven't done one of these yet.  Have you?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I've done one.  It's kind of awkward at first.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wasn't sure what was calling.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they -- it said something about best friends.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Okay.
L:  We're supposed to talk about you -- what kind of friends [MN] or, I guess, I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, we [LAUGH] live -- we live in the country.  I mean, we're in the real, real hicks.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  So, my best friend really is my mom.  
L:  Yeah?
R:  'Cause we live on her land.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- where do you live at?
R: +Huh?
L:  Where -- where are you at?
R:  We're in Florida.
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  Up in -- in the panhandle of Florida --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- near Tallahassee.
L:  Yeah.  We're kind of -- kind of out in the country but not too far away.
R:  Yeah, see we --
L:  We're --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Who -- who do you -- you have -- do you have a best friend?
L:  Uh, yeah.  Well, yeah, you know, I kinda did in high school but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then, uh, kinda lost track of her over the last several years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, got it -- got some good friends through my church and got a lady just down the streets -- down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the street that I -- we get along real well.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Not real --
R:  Yeah, we've --
L:  -- best friends but ...
R:  I've got a lot -- I've got a f- quite a few church friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but they're mostly older folks -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, uh -- and then just -- just yesterday, it's funny 'cause one of the girls -- we're painting and one of the girls that's more my age, she says, "You know, I'll be glad to come over and help paint".  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, I thought well maybe this is a good way to start being friends.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I [MN] -- I ended up marrying my friend.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  He -- uh, we met him -- I met him in high school and then I ended up marrying him.
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Yeah, I didn't meet my husband until, goodness.  He was just about couple of years fini- -- oh, well, it's like a couple of years before he finished his degree.  So ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  In -- out of college so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I was -- I was -- I'm thirteen years younger than he is so ...
R:  Okay.  
L:  Didn't go to high school together or anything.  So ...
R:  Well, we didn't go to high school.  He's six years older than me but I was in --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- high school when I met him.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh ...  But he -- yeah, he -- he was with me when I graduated and -- and everything.  We've been together almost, it'll be nineteen years.
L:  Oh, wow.  That's --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- great.  
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, we're just -- just about had -- just had our, uh, sixth anni- -- I think it's sixth [LAUGH] anniversary.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, in January, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Still kinda new at it.  But we're learning.
R:  Yeah.  It gets -- it gets easier but it gets harder too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We -- uh, friends of ours at church just celebrated their thirty -- uh, fifty first anniversary.
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  So it's like, well, maybe we can make it that far.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I was -- I've heard on the radio the other day, they had this, um, they just mentioned this couple that had their eighty first wedding anniversary.
R:  Wow.  
L:  And I'm like [LAUGH] I'm not sure if I want to live that long.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.  But -- but --
L:  He -- he was, like, a hundred and two and she was, like, ninety six.
R:  Wow.
L:  Still going strong.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  Wow.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's something.  
L:  Uh, we do --
R:  But you know you gotta be best friends in order to stay married I think.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  I- i- it's -- it's hard if you're, you know, if you're not friends.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then you throw children into it.  Mm, I'd say my --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kids are my friends too and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  We just try to stay together.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And do things like that.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But --
L:  We got -- we, uh, like to do a lot of things [MN] um, we've always -- most of our friends are, you know, work or church and so we've been trying to find friends in the neighborhood that are outside of the s- -- you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Two groups and we actually ended up just kinda -- there's a couple of couples in our church that we kind of don't -- we're k- we're friends -- really good friends with them but we don't necessarily do church type activities with them.  We end --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- up doing outside activities too, so ...
R:  Oh, well that's good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's good.  We, um -- I'm a stay home mom so I don't have opportunity to meet friends outside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of that.
L:  I am too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And [LAUGH] and then my husband's a police officer so we meet a few of friends, you know, that he works with.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But it's just with schedules it's so hard to meet up with 'em.
L:  Oh, I know.  
R:  But, uh --
L:  Mm.  Yeah, when you're home during the day it's -- you don't get to -- you know everybody else is working it seems like.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I've a --
R:  That -- that -- I guess that's why I use my mom as my [LAUGH] best friend.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  She and I every morning coffee -- have co- -- go ou- -- I go down there and have coffee with her for an hour or so before I --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- start my day.
L:  That would be nice.  My mom lives, uh, up in -- I'm in California.  My mom lives up in Or- -- in Washington so ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  It's too far away to see her everyday but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we call her.  We talk e- we talk several times a week so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, uh -- that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nice.  
R:  And my kids -- my kids, they're best friends with 'em too.  With my folks so ...
L:  Yeah, that's great.
R:  Yeah, it's nice.  It's nice --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to have that.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, um ...  What are your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hobbies?  Do you have any hobbies that ...?
L:  Oh, just my coupons and [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I do coupons too.  
L:  Do ya?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  My mom and I both.  So that's -- that's another thing that keeps us together.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We -- we just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- did a lot of, um, coupons.  Aqua drugs just did double coupons.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We don't --
R:  And we just --
L:  -- get -- our drugstores out here don't do doubles.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh --
R:  Well, ours just -- this is only the second time ours has ever done it.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's what I've --
R:  And --
L:  -- heard.  
R:  And, uh, really --
L:  It's a --
R:  -- we -- I really did well.  I was really pleased.  Got ninety six dollars for twenty six so ...
L:  Wow.
R:  I was really pleased with that.
L:  Yeah, I actually just got back from the grocery store.  I've a -- I have a, um, a retinal disease so I can't drive anymore by myself but I've f- found a friend to take me to the grocery store.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ended up paying like sixty seven dollars, um, for like two hundred and fifty dollars worth of groceries.
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  'Cause out here they double our -- at the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- grocery store they double.
R:  Yeah.  See we don't even have that.  We did -- when[?] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] actually did it I think maybe twice here. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, um, I only saved like half of my -- my, you know, my grocery bill but half is better than nothing, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I figure even if it's, you know, p- some people think, "Oh, twenty five cents off.  That's nothing".  But those twenty five cents add up.
R:  That's right.  And I -- and my mom and I keep telling everybody that.  That's why we get to be stay home moms because we --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- cut those coupons and ...
L:  We couldn't afford it [MN] otherwise.  
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  And, uh -- and then I -- I have two refund sites on the -- on the computer that I look through and --
L:  Yeah.  You're not, uh ... [LAUGH]  I think, d- -- uh, which ones are you affiliated with?
R:  R.E. and R.M.C.
L:  Yeah.  R.M.C. --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm on.  
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.  I kind of had a suspicion.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It's funny 'cause I've been reading on the topics that everybody's getting to introduce [LAUGH] everybody. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's funny.  
R:  [LAUGH]  But yeah, I pick up lots of +nice ideas from them.
L:  Oh, yeah, I know.  Yeah --
R:  And that --
L:  -- I get on to chit chat everyday and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a ...
R:  Right now we're knee deep in a project so I haven't been able to get on and 
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  So I really miss it.  'Cause that's why I'm in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the kids home from school, I don't get my computer time as much.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  [inaudible] something.  But I try.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have any children?
L:  I have one.  I have a --
R:  One?
L: -- four year old.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I've got --
L:  He turned --
R:  -- three.
L:  Yep.  She just turned four.  
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  My -- my sweetie.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  She's smart.
R:  I've got -- I've got three of 'em.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So I've got a sixteen year old boy.  A fourteen old year boy and a six year old girl.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And they're -- they're fun.  They're a handful.  
L:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible].
L:  Mine's finally getting to the age where she can be useful.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  So ...  And she loves to cut coupons.  I tell ya.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She's a --
R:  [MN]
L:  Everyday the [MN] uh, paper comes and she gets out her scissors and wants to cut those coupons out and I hand them to her and say, sure.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Saves me the hassle.  
R:  Exactly.  That's what I do with mine -- my six year --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- old.  Just give her the thing and tell her to cut 'em all out.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it keeps her busy for a while.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  You need -- you need to do that.  Teach 'em young.  [inaudible] but my boys are real coupon good.  They're good with coupons too though.
L:  [several inaudible words].  
R:  So ...
L:  Guys have to learn that too.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  My husband won't touch 'em.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, now, my husband, he's proud of me when I do it but he -- I don't know if he'd go and do it himself.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  My -- uh, mine -- mine's like, "Yeah, great.  I like that you're saving all this money but don't expect me to ever go with ya".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, let's see.  I did take mine to -- to [inaudible] when we doubled them.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, we had a good time looking around trying to get everything but I could tell he was getting impatient.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  So I won't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I won't do that.  I try to do that all by myself where I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can take my time and --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And do that kind of stuff.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  But, yeah, we live in the woods so ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Our closest neighbor's probably about a mile. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  We have to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have to -- I drive my kids a hundred miles round trip for school.  
L:  Oh, man.  I couldn't do --
R:  But --
L:  -- that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well, we do have schools closer.  It's just they're not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that good. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, so that's why it's hard to make friends when you live so far out and my kids don't really have that many friends close here but they do in school.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, we try to get 'em up together and as often as you can, but with that mileage it's hard to get 'em together often.  
L:  I'll bet, yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  So ...
R:  Mm.  Boy, this is [LAUGH] you end up [LAUGH] you look at the clock and you're like, how long?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  So this is your second one, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  Okay, this --
L:  And the other -- the last one I did was really awkward 'cause they wanted you to talk about exercise.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  Okay, what do you talk about?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  That wouldn't be -- that would be kinda hard.  [LAUGH]
