L:  Carmen Thompson.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Jo.  How are you?
L:  Hi, this is Carmen Philips.
R:  Ah, Jo [inaudible], how're you doing?
L:  [LAUGH] Good, how are you?  I can't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- believe this is fun, this is cute.
R:  I know.  I've --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- never even done this before, have you?
L:  No, never, no.
R:  No.
L:  Never, never.
R:  Huh.
L:  And they keep calling me and I forgot -- I forgot my -- almost forgot my, ah, pass code thing.  I can't -- still can't remember it.  But -- but I tried --
R:  Yeah, I don't know it either, but I keep seeing that they've left messages, but I never am home. 
L:  Right, right.
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about friends.
R:  Talk about friends, yes.  Um --
L:  I just got into a big argument with my be- -- one of my close friends.  She's not my best friend, but she's a close friend.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She is a nightmare.  Because --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- because she's, like, seven years older than I am --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she's been married for twenty years and she has children and her husband -- she's in an abusive marriage, but, ah, so she thought I was trying to tell on her about something she's doing and she's not living right, she's not doing the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- right thing. 
R:  Wow.
L:  So she got mad at me and she starting cursing at me. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  So, I haven't --
R:  That's not good for -- if she considers you a friend, huh?
L:  I know that.  I don't even fuss with my sisters and brothers like that, so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have -- I haven't spoken to her in a couple of days.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, but --
R:  So, do you have, um, a lot of friends or ...?
L:  Yeah, I do have a lot of friends. 
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  I have, ah, yeah -- do you?
R:  Yeah, I do.  I mean, I like to consider, like, most of my good friends, like, I -- I -- I have a lot of acquaintances, but maybe just, like, five or six real good friends.  So ...
L:  Oh, ye- -- me too, yeah.  I would say that.  I have -- I still have my friends from first grade. 
R:  Oh, you do?  Wow.  That's neat.
L:  I'm originally from West Virginia and, um, I talk to one of my friends that I started school with, um, and she lives in Virginia Beach now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, even friends from college, even, you know, all -- all through school I have -- a- a- and I usually keep my friends for a very long time.
R:  Well, yeah, it sounds like that.  That's neat.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Huh.
L:  Just, ah, I usually -- I usually [inaudible] stranger either. [LAUGH] 
R:  You're usually what?
L:  Don't meet a stranger, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- peop- -- you know --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm not so great at keeping in touch though.  That's my problem --
L:  [MN]
R:  So ...
L:  Oh.  Ju- -- a --
R:  It seems like it's hard to like, you know, when I -- when I have friends around and I see them a lot, it's easier for me to keep in touch with them than when I don't see them, you know, I -- I don't talk to them as often.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  I, um, I'm the one that keeps in touch.  I, um, contact --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- everyone.  Um --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- I remember, like, there was a group of us that hung around --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in high school and I ha- -- I remember everyone's birthday.
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  I -- I mean --
R:  That's very nice of you.
L:  -- it's so crazy, I mean, 'cause it's a little small town but still, I just, like, oh, I remember Gina's is June thirteenth.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I remember Diane's is December twenty ninth.
R:  Right.
L:  And Sheila's April tenth.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm like, is -- how do you remember that?  I don't know, I just --
R:  Yeah, you just do. 
L:  Ah, one particular -- I can't remember some other things, but I just remember that, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just crazy.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  [MN] 
R:  That makes it, you know, personal.
L:  Yeah, but then when they forget mine, which is coming up --
R:  Yeah, then you get upset, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't get upset, I just, you know --
R:  Well, you sort of expect the same thing. 
L:  Yeah, and everybody's not like -- like you say, you don't keep in touch.  Our friends have to always call --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I have to -- I have to say, "Well, why don't you ever call me back?" [inaudible]
R:  Right.
L:  They -- they'll call me back once I call them, but it's like, you know ...
R:  But they don't always initiate it.
L:  Right, and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I got -- I got in touch with a high school friend, um, just to give you an example, I w- -- we started seventh grade, that's when they -- our school -- she went to predominantly -- I'm a black female --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she went to an all white school --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I mean kindergart- -- elementary --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my school was mixed --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so when we came together the school all became mixed. 
R:  Oh.
L:  So she sat beside me,  she was, like, one of the -- she and the -- she's an extremely popular girl, very beautiful, and she went home and told her mother, "I sat next to a black girl and I have a black friend". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my gosh.
L:  And I sent her --
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- I sent her an email the other day, I said, "Lisa Window --" and I -- I -- I -- we used to always wonder what she was going to be like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when, you know, what -- how successful and -- 'cause she drove a corvette to school when she was seventeen, you know --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- she was, you know, one of those, th- th- the barbie dolls. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.
L:  And she, ah -- but she's doing very well.  And I've kept in touch with her too.  And my class --
R:  Oh, wow, so that's still good that you kept in touch with her.
L:  Yeah, do you keep in touch with yours at all, or just ...?
R:  Um, I keep in touch with, um, some of my college friends --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but I would say that's probably it.  I don't keep in touch with high school friends any more.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- 'cause, I -- I've moved quite a bit since I've, um, been in high school, so it's like a lot of the people that I, you know, would have kept in touch with, I don't speak to any more, 'cause I'm not again in that same area, so it's harder for me to see them and, you know, everyone gets busy, you know, you get married and then --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- most of my friends have kids now and it's like --
L:  You don't have children?
R:  No, not yet.
L:  Okay.
R:  No.  
L:  I have -- I'm -- well, I'm originally from West Virginia, I lived in Maryland for ten years and went to New Jersey for f- five -- four years and now I'm in New York.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I s- -- and actually -- and [MN] well, actually, one of my best friends, one's from Maryland and one's from Jersey.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So just, kinda, moved on up the east coast there.
R:  Yes, so lots of people have moved.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Huh.  Well, that's kinda neat.
L:  So, uh, yeah, we keep in touch.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  How did you hear about this program?
R:  Um, well one of my -- one of my next door neighbors is actually, like, ah, a mystery shopper and she had let me know about certain, like, websites to go to, to do the same thing.  And I went online and -- and looked at them and then I think someone just emailed me, um, from one of the, um, secret shopper groups --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that this was available, or something like that.  I think that's how it happened.  I think they emailed me and let me know to, um, do that.  But I've been doing the mystery shopping thing a lot, so ...  Um --
L:  You have?
R:  I think I --
L:  Can you send me --
R:  -- have been put on some list to do it.
L:  Okay.  D- -- let --
R:  So ...
L:  -- me give you my email if you can forward me something and we'll be -- and then we can be friends.
R:  Sure. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  W.V. --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- underscore girl --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- six eighteen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at Yahoo dot com.
R:  Okay.  Yeah --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I will email you.
L:  Yeah, great, great.
R:  That's neat, yes --
L:  Um --
R:  -- so, um, I don't know what, I guess, what we're -- else we're supposed to talk about --
L:  What else to talk about --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- Let's see.  How -- how do -- are your friends close to your age or are they older or younger?
R:  Ah, most of them are right around my age.  Um --
L:  And you are, if you don't mind me asking?
R:  I am gonna be thirty four in -- next month.
L:  Oh, okay.  My --
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  My -- I'm thirty -- I'll be thirty eight, um, in how many days -- how many days -- eight days or so. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's neat.
L:  But -- but I have a heart of, like, a twenty five.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm, like, always on the go and run and so ...  But I -- then I have --
R:  Young at heart.
L:  Yeah, very.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I have --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- my -- my friends that was odd -- I have a girl friend that's fifty and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we have a ball.  I mean, she --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- parties and dances and has a good time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then I have one forty eight and then -- the -- the only -- the one that's close to my age, we do bicker sometimes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, usually the ones that are older, I think I like the -- the fact that -- that you can learn something from so- -- the older ones.
R:  Definitely.
L:  You know.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And then a lot of mine that are my age are still looking for husbands or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- want children, or going through divorce and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all the drama, you know.
R:  Right.  That -- 
L:  It's like, ah ...
R:  -- that tends to happen.
L:  Right and I've been married for ten years and I'm just content, you know, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's not the perfect all American marriage, but, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I just don't feel like hearing the -- the, you know --
R:  The drama of, yeah ...
L:  Yeah, right, "Oh, y- you got any single friends?"  Oh, gosh, what, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  Do you, um, have kids too?
L:  I have one child.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And she's spoilt rotten.
R:  Oh, I'm sure, if she's an only child, right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but the only problem with having older friends is they're more flexible than you are.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, they say --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "Let's go to Barbados", and I say, "Well, I don't have a babysitter".
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so that's the problem with that.
R:  Oh, I'm sure, yeah.  Huh.
L:  And -- and I have a big thing about it, as far as friends and loyalty.  I don't know amongst -- you know, how in college, everybody say, "Oh, I got drunk and I didn't know what I was doing".
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, my gosh. If you say that to me, I -- I will -- oof, I can't stand that.  
R:  Oh, right.
L:  [inaudible] everything that you knew what you were doing --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you're responsible for everything.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And you don't cross the line with dating people's friends and old friends and all that other stuff. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right.  If you're a true friend --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't really use that excuse.
L:  Yeah, that's -- I don't believe in that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think that's -- that makes a friendship and you can say certain things, like I said, the one that came out of her face and started cussing me out, I didn't like that.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  That's terrible.
L:  Ain't that terrible?  She looked --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she [inaudible] my face --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Huh.
L:  Are you -- your friends -- are they close to there -- around your own area -- nei- neighborhood, or are they ...?
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean, some of them -- I have a few that are actually right in the area and I find that some of my newer friends -- 'cause I just got married in September --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  -- a lot of my newer friends are like, um, my husband's, you know, friends' wives.
L:  Wives.  Right, okay.
R:  So, um --
L:  Yeah, you're going to find that.
R:  -- that happens a lot and then, um, but I -- the close friends that I have that I've had, um, we actually moved maybe, like, forty five minutes away from a lot of them where I, um, used to live, so I still keep in touch with them a lot on the phone, but I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- don't seem to see them quite as often as I'd like to 'cause, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just being a good distance away, um, but yeah, we talk -- I usually talk to them at least maybe once a week or something.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And, um, keep in touch.
L:  Keep in touch with them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It is, it's nice.  But you know, I have to say, I consider, um, my mom one of my best friends.
L:  [MN] Oh, that'll --
R:  So that's kind of a nice thing.
L:  -- make me cry.
R:  [LAUGH] I really do.  Um, she lives --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- maybe a half hour away from me, but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we talk probably every day.
L:  Well, my mom -- I -- I, you know, um, my mom passed two years ago.
R:  Oh, that's bad.
L:  Um, is last -- in last May.  Okay.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Two -- two Mays ago, yeah.  And she -- I was very close to my mom too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I had -- so I have to re- -- I have an older sister --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and now that you mention that, I called my little -- I have three sisters --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I -- and they -- when I wanna tell them something that I can't tell anybody else --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I call them.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  I could tell -- I can tell each one of them different things, you know --
R:  That's really good.
L:  -- what I mean.  Like, I can't talk about, ah, certain, like -- I don't know -- I can't talk about sexual things with my older sister, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- what I mean.  I talk about logical things, decision making.
R:  Right.
L:  My middle sister, I can tak about, ah, I -- you know, everybody has a different story that I can talk to them --
R:  Sure. 
L:  -- about. 
R:  Definitely.
L:  So, yeah, you're right.  My sisters have become my -- my big best friends, um --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- all three of them. 
R:  Well, that's nice.
L:  You know, yeah, um --
R:  That's really nice. 
L:  'Cause they kinda replaced my mother.  I used to call my mother a lot.  I -- yeah, I think about her, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- one -- I picked up the phone to call her after nine eleven, since I work six blocks from there --
R:  Oh.  Wow.
L:  -- and I thought, "Ah, I can't call mommy to tell her". 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I should tell mommy, you know, and I thought, "Ah, mommy's gone".
R:  Oh, yeah, that's tough, isn't it?
L:  Yes, so you should --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- be happy that your mom is very -- yeah, your mom is your best friend, that's good.
R:  Definitely.  She definitely --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is one of them.  She's very cool, I mean we talk all the time.  I mean, I usually pretty much can tell her anything about anything.  Even stuff that I wouldn't tell, you know, my friends.  So that's --
L:  And she --
R:  -- kind of a nice thing.
L:  -- she doesn't judge you?
R:  No, she's very good about that.
