R:  Well, that's good.  Good.
L:  Yeah.  But this [inaudible] close friends.  I mean, I don't have any really, really close friends.  Uh, uh, my husband's ex military.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, we live here at the beach and it is a military town.  
R:  Right.
L:  And everybody knows everybody so you're, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Neighbors are really basically my best friends 'cause -- but they all work and -- and I don't work. 
R:  Right.
L:  So it's like, hi and what you doing, whatever.  You know.  So it's not really close because I've got my kids out here, so basically they're closer to me than my, you know.
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  Oh, I've got three kids.  Uh, one is thirty six.  One's thirty five.

R:  Wow.  How old's your granddaughter?
L:  She's gonna be five.
R:  Oh, that's a good age.
L:  That's one.  And the other one's gonna be s- the other one's seven.  [MN]
R:  Wow.  Oh, what a -- that sounds great.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- you don't sound too old.  You must be, +uh, younger?
R:  Uh, I'm thirty one.
L:  Oh, God, I wish I [LAUGH] was.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN]  It's all [LAUGH] right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's very --
L:  Those were good years.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess so.  I mean, I'm glad to be done with my twenties.  That's for sure.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Twenties are hard.  I don't care what Hollywood tells you.  The twenties are a hard age so ...
L:  Thirties and forties are great.  And after we hit forty eight [MN] everything goes downhill.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I'm already noticing, like, physically I'm like, whoa, what's this?  I was noticing today my elbows, I'm getting that sag that happens over --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- over your -- I know, I'm like hey, what -- what's that?  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's not supposed to happen yet.  
L:  [MN]  
R:  So, but ...
L:  Well, listen you gotta do is you gotta go, uh, exercise and, uh, walking with your -- your -- your close friends, your neighbors or whatever.  You have to --
R:  That's true.
L:  Do you have family close by?
R:  Uh, I don't.  My family's from Kansas.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so I've got, uh -- I live with my boyfriend here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And --
L:  So you're not married?
R:  No, not yet.  We're gonna get married so ...
L:  Oh. 
R:  But not yet.  Um, but I -- we have -- I -- it's -- it's weird because like my -- when I think of my best friend that's probably my mom.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...  But I have lots of -- lots of acquaintances.  I mean it's hard in the city to have --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- close friends because --
L:  Oh, you're basically in the city part?
R:  Yeah, I'm in Manhattan.  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  So, um, you know, everyone's just so busy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing their own thing.
L:  It's like, hi and I'll see you next week or ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Or -- or in two weeks, you know.
L:  Come over for, you know, uh, for lunch or whatever [several inaudible words] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  And it never happens.
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You play a lot of phone tag.  A lot of emails of, "What's your schedule this week?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...  Well, did you move a- around a lot with your husband or have you stayed pr- --
L:  Oh, we've been here since sixty seven.
R:  Wow.  
L:  I -- my youngest, when he was, uh, seven months when we moved here and we've been here ever since.  
R:  Wow, that's great.  'Cause I know, uh, my boyfriend's sister, his father was military --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she moved around for most of her life and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it was really hard on her.  So, you know, I think it's probably great that your kids got to grow up in one place.
L:  Oh, yeah, they -- they're all here.  In fact they all just bought new homes and stuff. 
R:  Oh that's great.
L:  And they're all within ten minutes direction of +me.  In different directions.
R:  Oh.  You are so lucky.  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fantastic. 
L:  It's fantastic.  And my mom lives up in Pennsylvania, by the Pokonos.
R:  Oh.  Hello?
L:  Are you still there?
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're getting some weird, uh, cutting offy things.  But that's okay.
L:  Yeah.  We go up that way -- there once or twice a year.  I -- I'm not a -- a -- a -- a mountains -- I hate the mountains.
R:  Yeah.  I like the -- I like the look of them.  But ...
L:  Yeah, look at 'em but I -- I'm ten minutes from ocean.
R:  Oh, I like the ocean.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  Yeah, it's beautiful though we've had horrible rain and today it's eighty five, I think.  So finally we got some nice beach weather.
R:  I know.  We've had the same thing.  We've had rain everyday.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Enough with the rain, already.
L:  Yeah.  It's been the same here.  Yesterday and today it got nice and they said tomorrow, and then rain's coming in again.
R:  Yeah.  So Virginia Beach, that's a -- you said that's about six hours from here?
L:  Oh, it's -- no, it's about [MN].  No, New York is, uh, from here is about, take my mom's, it takes us about seven hours so it's probably --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- gone eight, nine hours.  
R:  Wow.
L:  Depending on which part of, you know, whatever.  But, uh --
R:  Right.  'Cause my boyfriend and I wanted to take a weekend trip and I was like, mm, Virginia.  Maybe we could go down ...
L:  Oh, come down to the beach here.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, it's beautiful.
R:  Oh, I bet it's beautiful.  But we were looking at bed and breakfasts online and everything --
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- granted I was looking in, like, Cape May and the Hamptons but --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- everything was like a hundred and ninety five dollars a night.
L:  Oh, you want to go more up north then?
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  You don't want to come down south?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, [MN] I wouldn't mind coming down south.  We're just looking -- although we're looking for something reasonably close, but that's nice and near water.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, Williamsburg is not too far from here.  It's only --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like a forty five minute ride and you got a whole bunch of beautiful sightseeing.  It's all old, you know, Jamestown and --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- the whole bit.  
R:  Of course.
L:  It's gorgeous.  And you can go to Butch Gardens and stuff.  
R:  Right.  
L:  And, you know, that's -- that's like I said, it's only a [MN] -- within an hour from here.  
R:  Wow.  Is that an hour farther away from New York or an hour closer?
L:  No, it's an hour from us.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, if you want to -- I'm [MN] -- there's a lot of bed and +breakfasts up there because we've been up there to Williamsburg and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it's beautiful.  
R:  Oh, I bet it is.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I bet it is.
L:  It's really nice.  Something I -- I mean, uh, there -- I'm sure there's a lot of places.  I don't know if there's any bed and breakfasts -- there probably is here at the beach.  I'm not sure.
R:  I would imagine.  'Cause Virginia Beach, I mean, I know that's a destination.
L:  Yeah, it's [MN] huge.  We got two hundred and fifty thousand people here.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]  And more people from up north are coming down here because we are such nice people.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  That's great.  Yeah.
L:  We get all the people from New York and Pennsylvania, you know, we're -- I guess [MN] -- all my neighbors are all Pennsylvania people.
R:  Yep.
L:  And I'm Pennsylvania.  So there's four of us here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's the weirdest thing.  I said we leave back home.  We come over here and I said, you know, it's like I talk to them.  They're going in the same direction I am so it's really neat.
R:  That's really cool.  Where are you from originally?
L:  From Pennsylvania.
R:  Pennsylvania?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, perfect.
L:  Yeah.  The north eastern part, like, by the Pokonos there.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Which is, like I say, it's okay.  It's not my ty- my -- my type but it's just --
R:  No, you need the ocean.
L:  -- too many hills and my -- my mom.  I talk to her almost everyday and it's like fifty degrees.  I said, "Fifty.  It's June".  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it's been that here.  It's been in the fifties and sixties.  
L:  Yeah, we've had it, uh, yesterday, seventy [inaudible] to eighty five.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So people are looking forward to it because, you know, they want to go down the beach and do all the rides --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- and the surfing.  And, you know, vacationing --
R:  The water's gonna be so --
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  -- cold.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  All kinds of fireworks and all kinds of festivals going on, you know, at the water and stuff.  All kinds of ships, you know, coming in and whatever.
R:  Oh, that sounds good. 
L:  Oh, it's beautiful.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, walk the boardwalk and stuff.  Oh, it's gorgeous.
R:  That sounds great.  
L:  Walk the boardwalk and have an ice cream and, you know, chit chat ... [LAUGH] 
R:  I like all of that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, come --
R:  That sounds --
L:  -- on down.

L:  Uh, I belong to, uh, R.M.C.
R:  Uh ...
L:  Do you know what that is?
R:  I don't.  Something Marine Corps --
L:  Okay, yeah ...
R:  -- I'm imagining.
L:  No.  It's -- it's -- [inaudible] for refunding and rebating.  
R:  Oh.

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And make -- trade coupons and email each other and say, hi, what you doing?  You know, you're in Washington and we're, you know, over here so ...  It's terrific.  I love it.

R:  I'll have to check that out.  
L:  Yeah, and I -- be- being I never -- I never worked.  
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  
L:  I -- I'll be married in thirty seven years and I never worked.
R:  Wow.  What's the secret of a good marriage?
L:  [LAUGH]  I worked three weeks I think after I got married and my husband says, no more.  So that's it.
R:  Wow.  How -- how -- [MN] what's the secret of a good marriage?
L:  Uh, we get along very well. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fact, he's -- he just retired this past October.  He's fully retired but he's driving me nuts.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because it's bad enough before he came home, you know, and whatever, but now he's home and he's -- goes to bed late.  Sleeps late.  And whatever. 
R:  [MN]  Y- yeah.
L:  But [MN] we're -- we're good friends.  We've been always best fr- -- best friends.

R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Wow.

R:  Well, that's great.  
L:  When you get married and you're seventeen, eighteen, you don't have anything, you know.

R:  I know, which is just no fun.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it isn't.  Uh, I --
R:  I can't imagine it's any fun.  
L:  Yeah.  But it's -- it's nice chatting with you, girl.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Don't they have to come on the line and tell us when we're done?
