L:  Hi, I'm Joy.
R:  Hi, I'm Christine.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  I'm fine.  I'm calling from New York.
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  Oh, are [LAUGH] you?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.
R:  Long Island?
L:  No.  Brooklyn. 
R:   Oh, okay, close enough.  [MN] 
L:  Uh, where -- is that where you are?
R:  I'm on --
L:  In --
R:  -- Long Island, yeah.  
L:  Okay.
R:  In Huntingdon. 
L:  So the call -- well, there -- there were two questions.  One was, um, [MN] do you like, is it outdoor or indoor and then --
R:  Um --
L:  -- hot or cold?
R:  Yeah.  Right.  To prefer?
L:  Okay.  I couldn't hear.  So what about you?  Did you do anything this winter outside?
R:  Um, no.  I'm not an outside winter person.  I don't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ski.  [LAUGH]  I'd rather be inside with a hot chocolate or something.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, I'm not much of a skier although I do like to try to do, at least once a month, something outside, you know, like maybe during the winter, not camping, but I'll probably go couple a times this summer, you know, and -- and nothing hard core.
R:  Right.
L:  A couple of miles and put down a tent and, you know, relax.
R:  Do you have kids?
L:  Uh, no.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So that's probably why I [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH]  I have kids --
L:  Probably --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  
R:  So our outdoor activities in the winter are usually making a snowman or going sleigh riding.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Things to that effect.  But, um ...
L:  But that's a lot of exercise.  I mean, it is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not as if -- you know making a snowman is a lot of lifting and pulling and ...
R:  Oh, definitely, 'cause they us- --
L:  You know, [inaudible] walking up hill and ...
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [inaudible].  And I think, you know, I'm always impressed whenever I'm -- whenever I see people with kids camping or hiking.  I mean, anything more than just like sleeping in the tent and, you know, that kind of thing.  It just --
R:  Right.
L:  Because it's -- it's not as if kids don't have a lot of energy.  But there's something about having them along that makes you have to bring so much more equipment.
R:  Oh, I [LAUGH] know.
L:  And to prepare for so many more contingencies.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  And they can't carry their own weight in food and so there's that whole thing.
R:  Definitely.  Definitely.
L:  What about during the summer?  What are you going to be doing?
R:  Um, during the summer we usually go to the beach a lot.  We swim.  Um, the kids usually do camp, you know, that kind of stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Do they go away for camp or do they camp ...?
R:  Uh, we usually stay local but we're actually in the middle of moving so we're moving --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, we're moving to Delaware in two [LAUGH] weeks. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So ...  [LAUGH]  I've gotta find new activities to do down there.  So, uh ...
L:  It'd probably be, um, I've heard Delaware's a great state for outdoor activities.  I haven't --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- spent a lot of time there but I had some friends who went to University of Delaware and they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- said that there were [MN] so many places to, uh, do water activities 'cause they're on the ocean and then, um, they had like a lot of -- for some reason they had a lot of parks by their -- by where they lived.
R:  Right.
L:  And so ... And they had a big dog so they loved it.  They would just --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- take him out and different [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, 'cause we used to do a lot of boating too but we've sold our boat.  But, uh, we enjoyed that and my husband fishes so, you know, once in a while we'll tag along.  So that --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- kind of stuff.  
L:  It was funny that they were asking if, uh, about the cold and -- whether you liked the cold activities --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- or hot activities because --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, we're in the worst summer ever.  
R:  Ah, right. 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  It's like the -- the wrong people to ask.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  We're like, well, we used to like having seasons but I --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- guess this year we'll just deal with mediocre weather.
R:  Oh, let me tell you.
L:  That's a -- [LAUGH]  
R:  I am so --
L:  [MN]
R: -- tired of the rain too.
L:  It really -- I mean, I -- I went camping once so far this year.  I went down to Aserteak[?] which is down in Maryland.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the eastern shore.  And we had, you know, the day we hiked out it was raining that night.  You know, there was like the huge thunderstorm and then we had about four hours of sunshine Sunday morning when we were hiking back.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And we were like, okay.  This is -- this is passable.  This is okay.  Um, but I have reservations to camp out by -- I think it's called Heckshire[?] State Park?
R:  Okay.  That's out here.
L:  Robert Moses[?].  Yeah, it's out where you are.
R:  Right.  Okay.
L:  And it's for the twenty eighth.  And I'm like, is it gonna be warm by June twenty eighth because I don't want to camp all the way out by the beach if we're not going to be able to go on the beach?
R:  I know.
L:  It's not a lot of fun.
R:  It's been such a tease.  Like we'll have one nice day and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it'll start pouring again.  
L:  Like --
R:  So ...
L:  -- four hours of sunshine.  
R:  I know.
L:  And then the rain.
R:  And the kids are so looking -- you know, [MN] I had the kids outside today.  [inaudible] just running around the yard and stuff and [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they just need to be out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  
L:  And this time of year I -- I feel like if you're not active outdoors then the weather can be really depressing.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, if you let it sort of stop you from doing things.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- I mean there's a lot of -- there's been a lot of cloudy days and a lot of sprinkly days --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which, you know, really don't nece- -- have to ruin your day.
R:  No.
L:  But, you know, you can [several inaudible words] --
R:  But it makes you want to take a nap.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Yesterday I went to, uh, Belmont for the race.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And it was just pouring.  And --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- there was still just hundreds of picnickers out there.
R:  Wow.
L:  We were like sat at the beer tent.  You know they set up the big beer tents and they set up their little canopies, and just like stuck it out.  And I was very pr- -- I wasn't outside all day.  I wouldn't have been able to do that.  I know I would've been like this is miserable.  I hate being wet and ...
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  And I was inside but it was just like, oh, it's so great that people [several inaudible words] they still had a great day.  
R:  I know.  I mean, I'm really looking forward to, you know, being able to go to the beach and just having a nice day where there's a little breeze and I can sit and read a book.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, while the kids are playing and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then --
L:  Do you have outdoor space by your house or do you have to go to a park?
R:  Uh, no.  We have a -- we have a nice big yard and, um, you know, if we have to go to a park there's so many around here, you know, right down the road and we'll get together with other mothers for play dates and stuff.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we all try to keep busy.  
L:  [MN]  
R:  Nothing worse --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- than bored children.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  That's -- yeah, the one -- I -- I know I get bored real easily.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just think I never grew out of it.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because when I was little I was, you know, the kind of kid who'd read in front of the television.  I just couldn't do one thing at a time.  
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And now people still make fun of me.  They're like, "What's wrong with you Joy?  Just watch the movie".  I'm like , "I can't".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I can't just sit here.  And I'm [several inaudible words] get --
R:  I --
L:  You --
R:  What?
L:  -- know some outdoor activity because I don't like the gym and so if I don't go outside I just get, you know, sit in front of my -- um, my office.  My kind of job is I just sit all day in front of my computer.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Basically.  
R:  Okay.
L:  So I need [MN] -- I've been trying to, um, to walk to work a lot.  I can walk over the Brooklyn Bridge to downtown.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  So I've been trying to do that.  And just -- and cloudy days discourage me if I wake up and I'm like, oh, it's gonna rain.  Then I don't walk.  
R:  Right.
L:  And then, of course, it's like just cloudy all day so [several inaudible words] that.  You know, I could -- it's a forty minute walk.  It's not that and it's my way of like trying to be outside at least for forty minutes a day.  
R:  Right.  
L:  Instead of going from my house into the subway, into the building, into the subway, you know, it's kind of ...  [several inaudible words].  Do you, um, do you work outside your house or do you work at home?
R:  Um.  Well, n- no I -- actually I do, uh, home parties.  I was with Tupperware for a while and now I'm with --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- home and garden party.  [LAUGH]  So I get out.  In fact, I had a party last night so I get out --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- and -- and get to mingle with some adults.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And spend time with the kids during the day.  You know.
L:  Right.
R:  So it's -- it works out perfect.  
L:  And are they off of school yet?
R:  Um, no.  About two weeks.  So that's what --
L:  Oh, well.
R:  -- we're coinciding with --
L:  That seems late. 
R:  -- clo- closing.
L:  Is that usual?
R:  Um, yeah.  Yes, for the little ones it is.  
L:  Okay.
R:  You know.
L:  And then do their schools usually have, um, uh, after school and summer activities for them or is it just [MN]?
R:  The -- the town usually has a program which is really great.  Like I -- I had them in camp last year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like right down the street [MN] for --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- like three hours.  Three hours for six weeks.  It was like a hundred and sixty five dollars.  I mean, it was ...
L:  Oh, my God.  That's great.
R:  Oh, it was so reasonable.  And she loved it.  You know, my daughter loved it 'cause, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, on warm days they had a sprinkler and they would go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- outside.  And on the days it wasn't nice they'd do a craft or something inside.  But it was just long enough for her.  She was five at the time.
L:  Oh, three hours.  Yes, right.
R:  Right.  That she, you know ...  And it was great because then by the time I picked 'em up at noon we could still go to the beach.  And we could still do things.  You know.
L:  And then they still had to have a schedule, so they still had to get up at the same time.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, or else they sort of slip into that, right?
R:  Right.  So, uh, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no, it's -- it's worked out well.  And I find --
L:  And do you --
R:  -- myself, I just joined, um, Curves.  
L:  Oh I -- a friend of mine just did that.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah.
L:  Oh, God [several inaudible words]. 
R:  I love it.  I absolutely love it.  'Cause I hate to exercise but I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- find that I'm so charged up when I get home.  I'm so full of energy and it just --
L:  She does get -- I mean, my gym is only two blocks away.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I just don't like being inside.  I- it's not like -- it's not [MN] you know, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't really care about the -- the workout and whatever.  I -- I could bike the whole time and watch --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- TV.  But I just can't stand being in there, you know, and -- when it's nice out. 
R:  Right.
L:  But then I don't -- I'm not exactly biking around.  So ...
R:  Right.
L:  I [LAUGH] +should be out [inaudible] biking and I wiped off my bicycle a few weeks ago and so now I'm -- I'm sort of not getting back on yet.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm just -- it -- it wasn't even, you know.  It wasn't even nearly as bad as it could be but it was just like I still ache and I'm like I don't want to get back on the bike.  And so then I'm like I don't really want to go to the gym.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I [LAUGH] try.  I haven't been doing very much.
R:  Well, see --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for me it's perfect because, you know, I -- I always say, oh, I want to get a bike and I want to ride but with the kids I just c- -- I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  -- very limited as to what I can do.  So when they're in school I'll go to the gym and it kind of forces --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- me to -- to exercise and do something.  You know.  Instead of --
L:  What about --
R:  -- cleaning all the time.
L:  -- those, um -- [LIPSMACK] what about those little bikes attached to the adult bike?  Have you guys tried that?
R:  No, I -- you know I haven't even bought a bike yet.  I think once --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we move I -- I would like to do something like that.  And, uh, 'cause I live on a busy street here and it's kinda hard.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Like I will take them for walks and stuff if --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- we're staying close to home.  But, um, you know, I don't really want to bike ride around here. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, that's something I mi- I might do 'cause I've been talking about that for a while.  And once I get --
L:  And that will --
R:  -- in shape ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  But the biking I think I, um, when I was in s- -- I've never had a car so I've always, you know, had the bike as be- -- as a commuting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- method.  And then, have you heard of Bike New York?
R:  No.
L:  Um, like, uh, maybe two months ago they had an event called Bike New York.  They closed down forty two miles of streets through the five boroughs.  
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  And like thirty thousand people just, like, you know, bike the forty two mile loop through all five boroughs and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  There's no --
R:  Did you do --
L:  It's not -- 
R:  -- the whole thing?
L:  Yeah, it's not a race.  It's really, like, m- mellow.  You can take all day if you want.  They have, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- rest stops all over.  You know, it's not, um -- but there are all these people who have these bikes, the tandem bikes which you know, has two or three people on them.
R:  Right.  Right
L:  But then they also had these little attachments.  It's sort of like -- like a kid's bike with one wheel that was attached to the adult bike.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So the kid was pedaling.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It wasn't just like the kid [MN] -- it wasn't like you were just pulling a
