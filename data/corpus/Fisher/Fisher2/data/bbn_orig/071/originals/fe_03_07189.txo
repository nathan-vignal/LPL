R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm Lisa.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, thank you.  My name is Kristy.
R:  Kristy?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  [MN]
L:  All right, so ...
R:  Uh, I guess we just talk about friends?
L:  Yes, I guess [LAUGH] so.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Well, um, I have basically one female that I consider my best friend.  What about you?
L:  I really don't have anyone outside my family who I -- I consider a best friend [LAUGH] anymore.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So -- 'cause I went through a period after high school where the high school friends kind of went their own way and I went my own so ...
R:  Oh.  
L:  I -- I guess my husband's my [LAUGH] best friend --
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  -- and my [inaudible].
R:  -- that might be count as a good friend.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  'Cause, you know, you pick 'em, right?  So ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You're not stuck with them so they gotta be your friend.  
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  No, I've just got one girlfriend and, you know, and then she -- we're not that close.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, like you say, outside of family that's about it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  But, I mean, family's as good as friends anyway so ...
R:  Oh, some of them. 
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Some of -- that's true.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  A few of them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some of them but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I just -- well, we just recently moved here, well, not recently.  It's been about four years ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I haven't had a chance to make any friends really.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's tough to make friends when you're older, you know.  When --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're a kid it's not so bad 'cause there's all the kids that kind of shove you together, but when you're an adult, you know, where are you gonna meet [LAUGH] them.  
R:  Right.  
L:  So ...
R:  And life is mostly fill- -- for me my life is mostly filled with my own stuff so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  
R:  Yeah.  And I had one person here who I used to consider a friend but then, you know, as time progressed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it looked like we weren't really ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it was more one sided.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, and that happens too.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Sometimes there's not many people worth being friends with, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  True.  True.
L:  Around.  But then --
R:  But I still, you know, like to consider myself her friend but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mm, it's questionable as to --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- whether my -- she's mine.  
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  Mm, yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  It happens.  But ...  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I mean, you move around that's what happens.
L:  Yes.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  That is so true.  That's our problem.  We ended up moving and moving and every two years we're all moving around so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, even if I do find someone -- or they move, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so the few people I've had that I've become more than an acquaintance with end up moving away and, you know.
R:  Right.  
L:  So it's -- it's -- sometimes I think to myself, oh, I'm not even gonna bother.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]  'Cause they might just move away again.  Like I just met a woman at the school.  She's my daughter's friend's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- mother.  And she's a nice person.  I talk to her all the time but then she's moving away in August.  
R:  You see.
L:  So, you know, it's -- I feel, like, gosh [LAUGH] you know, all that time, you know, wasted on, uh -- on, uh -- 
R:  But it's -- it's not really wasted.  You know.
L:  I guess.
R:  'Cause I still keep in touch with, you know, my friend from, you know, where I came -- where I moved from.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, it's not quite -- we -- we still good fr- -- and I do have one good male friend.
L:  Mhm
R:  And, um, you know, we've been friends for about ten or fifteen years.  
L:  Wow.
R:  I forgot about him.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess you'd say two.  [LAUGH] 
L:  There you go.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, that's good.  I have -- I do actually, n- now that you mention a male friend, I do have a male friend who I've had, God, it -- yeah, it'd be about ten years now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words]. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, uh, but I don't -- I don't talk to him on the phone or anything.  I -- I just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I talk to him over the computer because he's always at work.  
R:  Right.  
L:  So I do talk to him but, I mean, we don't talk about anything, you know, important.  
R:  Right.
L:  Or anything.  You know, we just say how's your day?  Oh, it's raining and, you [LAUGH] know, stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, we talk often.  Well --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- not often -- well, when I say often it's probably like once a month.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's not bad though. 
R:  No, that's not bad.  Not bad at all.
L:  We used to have someone checking in once and a [LAUGH] while.
R:  Huh?
L:  You know.  At least you have someone checking in once in a while on you to see how you're doing and everything, you know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And [MN] -- I guess that's basically -- I guess, too, you need to define what a friend is.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true.  'Cause I consider a friend a lot more than probably a lot of people would.  Like I know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- people here.  I say hello to them, talk to them in the elevator or [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, that's not a friend.  [MN]
L:  That's not a friend, no.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  That's an acquaintance.  
L:  Exactly, so ...
R:  Mm.  And I have a lot of acquaintances --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but very, very, very few friends.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Very few people I would consider a friend --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because to me when [MN] you call somebody a friend that means -- that means you'll do just about anything for them.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  And it's not --
L:  And it's deeper.
R:  -- many people -- huh?
L:  And it's a deeper thing.  You know, you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- talk about stuff and if you have problems you can talk to them or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you need something ...
R:  And it won't go anywhere.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  And that's the hard part of finding --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  -- [LAUGH] people.  
L:  That is so true.  'Specially with women though.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I find.  Because the men, it's -- it's so different to be friends with a man.
R:  Right.
L:  Than to be friends with a woman so ...
R:  E- -- right.  And see most of mine, I've been friends mostly with males --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because females, I don't know ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I think --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it takes a certain kind of female to have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of female friends.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I'm not that kind of female.  And you're obviously [LAUGH] not.
R:  No.  No. 
L:  So ...
R:  I'm definitely not.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  'Cause I mean, I have on the computer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I have friends who are female who I -- I do tell a lot of stuff too but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- we've known each other for years and years but we can't afford to visit each other 'cause they're in the States and I'm in Canada.
R:  Right.
L:  So I can't even say that they're like a friend because I've never met them and who knows, they could be something [inaudible] --
R:  Anybody.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But it's -- and even out of them, most of them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are male.
R:  See --
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  You know.  
R:  And that's me.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even in high school I was the same way.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [MN]  And so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I had a bunch of male friends and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- hardly any female friends.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I could never figure that out.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just, I don't know. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Females are hard to get along with, I think.  You know, especially --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in high school.  Gosh, there's so much gossiping --
R:  Competition. 
L:  -- and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- backstabbing and stuff.  And unless you're, you know, that kind of person, you know, and hopefully most people [LAUGH] aren't that kind of person.
R:  Mm.  Right.
L:  That you're not going to, you know, look I had one female friend and she was just like me.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  So ...  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Nothing wrong with that.  
R:  No.  
L:  You know.
R:  It's that -- I guess I'm not into all of the gossip scene.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know and, like, after I moved here it was like I was an outcast so ...
L:  Oh.  
R:  You know, you -- you go to the beauty shop to get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your hair done and there's a bunch of gossiping and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this is a small town where I live.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.
R:  So it's like you know the people they're talking about and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] I don't want to hear their business.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]  So I stopped going.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  That's fun.  But then when you're not there, you know, what they're talking about.  It's gonna be you and not [several inaudible words].
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Infuriating.
R:  And I have a problem with that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I can't [LAUGH] blame you.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And that's why -- I live in, uh, Toronto which is the biggest city here so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not so bad.  You don't really -- but this is the other thing.  I don't know anybody here.  
R:  Right.
L:  And I've lived here my whole life in a -- in a suburb.
R:  Really?
L:  And I don't know anybody here except for that one woman from the school.  And when she's gone, you know, that's it.  'Cause I live in a building that has a couple thousand people living in it.  
R:  Right.  And you're just --
L:  So --
R:  -- busy with your own life.  
L:  Exactly.  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go out that much.  Just take my daughter to school, go shopping or something.  And ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I know the women who work at the stores.  
R:  Right.
L:  And -- but that's about it.  Because the people here keep --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to themselves.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  And that's me.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- keep -- I -- matter of fact, I just found out what my neighbor name was when they found her dead in the house.
L:  Oh, no.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  And it's [LAUGH] like, oh, my God I've been living here, you know --
L:  Yeah, four years.
R:  -- almost four years and I didn't even know the lady's name.
L:  Wow.  
R:  [LAUGH]  If --
L:  That's -- that's the way it is though, you know.  Uh -- uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Most of the time the neighbors stay to themselves, you stay to yourself and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it -- it's rare to find a neighbor you'd like anyway.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, you know, most of the time I'm getting mad at my neighbors.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Leaving notes on their door, you know.  Don't dump water on my balcony and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or turn the music down please.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't want them to know my [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They'll turn me in or something.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...  Maybe it's better that way.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  But ...  
R:  Uh, friends --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are -- friends are really, I don't know.  Like I tell my kids all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they feel -- they're so quick to call people friends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, of course, I guess when you're kids, okay.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I said, no, no.  Friends are rare.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  You have plenty of acquaintances.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But friends stick by you regardless of what.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you can still say that that person's a friend a year later then maybe that's a friend.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But when you're a kid -- like, even in high school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had lots of people I thought were my friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then I got married and I had a baby and then they didn't get married and they didn't have babies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they didn't want to play with me anymore, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.
L:  I'm not going out and -- and partying and, I don't know any of that stuff.  I'd rather stay home and ...
R:  Right.  
L:  You know, watch a move or something and [inaudible].
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  [several inaudible words]. 
R:  That's me.  That's me.  I really --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- keep to myself.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I really do.
L:  That's the best way to be.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's not that I'm not a friendly person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I am.  It's just that, you know and I -- I'll [MN] -- I can talk real easily --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just that [SIGH] I don't know.  Round here everyone is kind of, I don't -- I wouldn't say everyone's small minded.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they prefer talking about people.
L:  Exact- --
R:  And that's just not on my agenda.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  That's the thing in small towns.  That's so much of the culture in small towns, you know, than ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's why I stay here.  That's why --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I probably will never move, 'cause here nobody talks about anybody 'cause nobody knows.  But, you know, here what are we talking about?  SARs and West [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And talk about --
L:  So ...
R:  -- events and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's going -- and -- and that's the kind of thing that I'm saying that I don't mind talking about.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, you know, is -- I don't want people to think that I think I'm better than them.
L:  No. 
R:  But it's just that, I don't like talking about other people.  
L:  Exactly.  It's -- it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you don't want people talking about you, you don't talk about other people.
R:  Right.
L:  That must be fair.  
R:  Right.  
L:  You know.  But so many people don't understand that.  They don't think -- they think about, oh, well, I want to talk about it and they don't think about [MN] how would I feel?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, how would I feel if -- if people talked about me like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that.
L:  Exact- --
R:  And that's how I -- this -- you know, basically what I do is I put myself in other people's shoes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And see, you know, okay, no I wouldn't want folks talking about me and talking about
