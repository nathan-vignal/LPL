L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Suzanna.  I'm from, um, the D.C. area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Washington D.C.  Where, uh, what's your name?
L:  Uh, my name is Aditi[?].
R:  Okay.  
L:  And I'm from the California Silicon Valley, actually.
R:  Wow. 
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So this topic is --
R:  Could we be any further apart?
L:  Oh, my gosh.  This topic is too much.  You know.
R:  It is.
L:  Too close to my heart.  Yeah.  To my ...
R:  Well, have you, um, talked to anyone about it before?  Or did you -- is it --
L:  Did I what?  Have I what?
R:  Have you talked about it before?
L:  No.  I mean, o- on this?  No.  No.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  'Cause I -- this is actually my fourth time.  I think that, uh, maybe it's a mistake but I'm just gonna --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- keep talking about it.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, now, [MN] --
R:  Um, but we -- I've been talking about Enron and Martha Stewart and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, the really popular --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- corporate scandals.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I talked to two people in -- in about their fifties.  A man and a woman.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And both of them, sort of, h- have said that this c- -- is to be expected.  It's a dog eat dog world and, you know, people shouldn't be doing this but they're gonna be doing this.  And the last guy I just talked to was probably in his twenties and he seemed to have, sort of a -- a passionate way of looking at it. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  As [MN] and I kind of do too, that there's got to be something that we can do to ...
L:  Oh, I'm sure we can do.  I mean, this has hit home.  I mean, I used to work for Excite at home.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which -- it -- it -- it's a company, internet company provider company which --
R:  Excite?
L:  Excite, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I've definitely heard of it.
L:  It just, uh, went bankrupt and it -- within --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- a year and, um, and it was mainly -- I mean, it's not as big as Enron so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- people don't know about it that much.  But, you know, there are cases and law suits and [MN], you know, all those things filed and both me and my husband got, you know, a basic -- I sank -- we sank with the ship.  
R:  Oh, no.
L:  But we pretty much got, uh, laid off and my husband, in fact, had been -- had alerted the upper management about the -- you know, the V.P.N. about some, uh, frauds.
R:  Right. 
L:  And -- that were happening.  And he was really -- [MN] -- and he basically was fired from the company because of that.
R:  Wow.
L:  So I know first hand, you know, how this [MN] I mean, you know, it's -- it's only a -- I'm just a small fish but --
R:  No, but -- I mean, you have specific --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- ex- -- or par- particular experience of it.
L:  Particular experience and, uh, um, our -- our experience was, uh, with an acquisition.
R:  Wow.
L:  How the acquisition was made and, uh, you know, we were -- we are technical people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So we gave our recommendations and we gave our recommendations against it.  All our, you know, whatever we valuated, it was against it.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It didn't make sense for -- to do it.  But it -- they went ahead and it was, you know, the deal was made.  And so I'm sure it was some sort of an accounting +thing, you know, which [MN] it, whatever it, I -- we don't exactly know how the dollar is, you know, whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  But from a technical standpoint and from our future, um, [LIPSMACK] expansion of the company --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as far the technical, uh, the network was concerned it didn't make sense to have it.  
R:  Really?  And so why do you think they ended up doing it?  
L:  Well, be- -- see a lot of times, you know, uh, it's -- I'm not -- I'm not a finance person.
R:  Right.
L:  But there are many ways of, uh, [MN] you know, a lot of times in the S.E.C., uh, filings, the ten K. has all the details.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ten K. filings.  But [MN] just, uh, some of the annual reports and some of the -- they -- you don't have to really go down and show each of your transactions, and the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- revenue and -- you can just, um, gloss over a lot of these things.
R:  Right.
L:  If you acquire the company then they become your asset.  So --
R:  Oh, right.  
L:  Right?  So you list them as asset and you don't really have to list the amount of dollars that you really spent or how much money you spent -- gave away in stocks.  Or --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you are going to give away in stocks to the people that you are going to acquire.  So it's just -- it's -- it's -- it, to me, it's a delay tactic.  Some -- at some point they have to re- -- you know they have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to, uh, declare but [MN] you know, at that time they were growing and they didn't want them, uh, to look bad and, um, so, you know, this is a way of projecting the image that you are growing and you are, uh, making all these deals and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you just do it and then, of course, it collapsed when, you know, [MN] at -- finally you have to have the dollars.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Otherwise you cannot exist. 
R:  Right.
L:  And that's what happened.  
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But it was -- it's just another corp- -- it's a huge building.  They expanded like, uh -- you know, and then three thousand people just gone.  In -- you know.  Employed.  Unem- -- they're now u- unemployed and stuff so ...  So it's pretty amazing.
R:  Yeah, I can imagine.  I mean that -- even if you think you're a little fish in a big sea, uh, I mean, [MN] well, that's disturbing in itself that people, just like you, tons of people like you are experiencing things like this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, the closest thing I have to any experience of this is that I'm dating someone, and I have several friends who just graduated from college, and they can't get jobs in the business world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because the economy's mess --
L:  Right
R:  I mean, real down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, they're perfectly qualified but, I mean, my opinion of the business world at this point, just as a -- a spectator really 'cause I'm -- you know, I just watch the news and what not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm just gonna be a teacher.  I'm stay- staying --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- away from it all. Um, I -- it seems like such a corrupt, um ...
L:  World.  Yeah.
R:  Environment
L:  It's a very corrupt.  And power begets power.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you have power, you know, you get more power and you want to keep that power.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so to keep that power you're ready to, you know, sacrifice a lot of things.  
R:  Well, what's so sad is that -- what -- and I say this a lot.  Um, your -- your name sounds like you're from somewhere else.  Um --
L:  Yes.  India.
R:  Okay. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I -- I don't -- I -- I -- I don't know much about a lot of different -- uh, my parents are, um, diplomats and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I've -- I've lived overseas a bit but I know that one thing I've noticed as I've gotten older is that the United States, in particular, being this American dream country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- has this very individualistic, um, way of looking at things.  Capital- capitalism, sorry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Capitalism is very, um, very concerned with individual success.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not -- I mean, it's -- you know, the best -- the best person wins, kind of thing.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And it -- it's -- it really promotes greed but there are --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- plenty of cultures out there, and some people call them primitive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But there are plenty of cultures where people do the best thing for society.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and they -- they're just taught to do that from the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- time they're, you know, old enough to talk.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I ju- -- I -- I feel like a lot of times we look down on -- on societies like that and it's so interesting 'cause we have so many people come in from other countries to this environment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I just --
L:  [MN]
R:  I wonder what they think about it.
L:  Well, I will say that although I'm from a diff- uh, uh, from a different country.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I will say that the government here now needs to really address the issues of the American public.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, uh, it is not a time to, uh, yes, they have to reach out to the, uh, o- outside community.  To the, uh, foreign community and stuff but they really need to do something about the community here.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And as you say, you're very right.  In other word, it's very individualistic and it has, you know, promoted greed and stuff like that.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And now what has happened is -- but people want to continue that lifestyle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  E- especially the people who are doing well.
R:  Yeah, the ones on top.
L:  Right.
R:  I suppose.
L:  And so what do they do?  How do they maintain their living standards?  They are going out to other countries, getting cheap labor and stuff and, uh, maintaining their own standard of living.  But that --
R:  It's so selfish.  I'm embarrassed --
L:  It is.  It is.
R:  -- to be in a culture that -- that 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- promotes --
L:  But the --
R:  -- that stuff.  
L:  But the thing is now it has -- it's really affecting the American population because there are a lot of people in America who are Americans.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they are qualified and they're not getting jobs.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, because, uh, these two people -- these corporations, they want to make their profits and stuff and [MN] and I'm c- -- you know, I -- I have also come here and, you know, [MN] I feel terrible thing this because, uh, you know, uh, sometimes I feel I shouldn't be here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, uh, be- -- and -- but the thing is, I hope I'm giving back something to this community too.
R:  Well, I bet you are.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And I -- I mean, I think one of the best things that the United States has going for it is that it does bring in a lot of people from other cultures and it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  In gen- -- compared to a lot of places it's pretty tolerant.
L:  Right.
R:  Which I think is really cool.
L:  Right.
R:  And a lot of those primitive cultures that I'm telling you about, they're so concerned about their society they won't let anyone else.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  You know and ...
L:  That's closed.  I mean, then, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I mean, America's not like that's wonderful and ... You know, we all got a lot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and that --
R:  Right.
L:  But right now it's, uh, really a time to evaluate, you know, some of the practices and whether the people in the community are being taken care of.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know, and, uh, okay, you're educating the public.  Are you assimilating these, uh, educated public into the working system?
R:  That's such a good point.  'Cause, I mean, [MN] I feel like the -- the big thing in the news has been Iraq and, like, with the war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on terrorism.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now that they're talking about Bush, sort of, ma- -- have you seen this recently --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in the news?  Bush manipulating the weapons of mass destruction?
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Oh, [MN]
R:  When it really was all about oil.
L:  [MN]
R:  Which is what a lot of people have been saying all along.  I mean, is that -- what is it?  Its -- North Korea has proven that they have weapons of mass [MN] destruction.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And we're not doing [LAUGH] anything.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  You know.
L:  -- we are on the west cost, you know, so -- so we are -- 
R:  Right.
L:  California is gonna ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- it's so frustrating 'cause I -- I feel like Bush is taking emphasis away from the economy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- by doing things like this because the economy sucks.  And he's not doing anything to make it any better.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, from what I -- I'd -- maybe I'm missing out on stuff.  I don't watch e- every --
L:  No.
R:  -- bit of news that --
L:  I think you've got the poi- -- you know.  Uh ...
R:  Wha- -- yeah, I mean, if -- if --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I were a president and I were concerned about my power and my country was falling to shambles economically and, um, I didn't know what to do about it, I would, you know, address the world and pretend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that there's -- there was nothing to address in the country.  But the problem with that is that eventually we're just gonna collapse.  I mean, every empire collapses at --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some point. And this could be the beginning of it.  I mean, it could be any sort of -- it could be weapons of mass destruction that blow up places or it could be our economy just really falling to shambles.
L:  Right. 
R:  For --
L:  You know
