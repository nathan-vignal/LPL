R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Janette.
L:  I'm Missy.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where are you from?
R:  North Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm Jackson, Mississippi.
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  Yeah.  So our topic is sports?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm --
R:  Something I'm not really that fond of.
L:  [LAUGH]  Me either.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I did though go yesterday and play putt putt.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  If that counts?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I guess it does.
L:  Um, but other than that.  Let's see.  I walk some.  Um ...
R:  Well, that's a outdoor activity.
L:  Yeah.  I also go to baseball games but that -- I don't play [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, let's see.  Um, I like tennis.  But I haven't played in a while.
L:  Mhm.  I've always wanted to take tennis lessons but ...
R:  Oh, man.
L:  I never have.
R:  I was watching the French Open today and [LAUGH] I forgot most of everything I learned.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, um, I like ping pong but I don't get a chance to play it much.
L:  Yeah, I've never -- I -- I used to play a friend of mine.  I'm from Shreveport, Louisiana, originally and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, she had a ping pong table.  We'd play some but, yeah, I never got very good at that either.  I like to swim.  I was a, um, swimming -- swim instructor --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, for a couple of summers.  So, I guess I swim.  You know, lifeguard and stuff.
R:  Oh, that sounds interesting.
L:  Yeah.  It was pretty fun.  It was, um, three, four and five year olds.  So it was mostly just playing around in the water.  Not much swimming but --
R:  I'd be afraid --
L:  -- it was fun.
R:  -- I'd drown.  
L:  Yeah, it was really fun though.
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't swim much 'cause [LAUGH] well, I could probably float but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I -- um, I don't really get to the beach or anything much and ...
L:  Uh, do you live near the beach in North Carolina?
R:  No.  Um, I live, um, shoot.  I'm probably about fifty miles from the beach.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH]  If not, more.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  So are you near any mountains?
R:  No.  I'm not.
L:  Just kind of in the middle?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Sort of I'm like, um, close to Raleigh[?] and, you know, I live --
L:  Oh.  My sister --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- lived in, um, Chappel Hill --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for two -- her husband is a, um -- I know this isn't sports oriented but, anyway, her husband's a nurse and they travelled around the country doing three months in different cities and she lived in, um, Chappel Hill for a while.
R:  Mm.
L:  So she really liked it.
R:  Well, I like playing card games.
L:  Yeah, I do too.  We have a bunko[?] group.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  I like rummy.
L:  I guess that's dice, but it's fun.
R:  I like rummy.  My daddy taught me to play when I was five years old and I've been beating him ever since.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Not [several inaudible words] but I guess it's just luck.  I don't know.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And my best friend, I play with her and beat her.  I'll let her win every so often but ...
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm not -- I haven't -- I -- I guess I've played it before.  I've never -- I'm not very good at that.  My -- my card games really are more like go fish and stuff [LAUGH] like that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I do -- I play poker some with just, you know, like, [MN] very small amount of money.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But ...
R:  I like, um, mostly for outdoors, I guess, I could say, um, well, I can't golf and I can't putt putt so, uh ... [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I'm not very good at it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  And I can't even ride a horse so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I haven't ridden a horse in a long time.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That -- I used to.  I had a friend in Shreveport who had a couple of horses and we'd be out there and ride sometimes.  That was pretty fun.  I never -- I was too scared to go really fast on him.  And the one time I did go fast I almost fell off.  
R:  Hm.
L:  So ...  [LAUGH]  But ...
R:  I wa- -- [SIGH]  Let's see.  What else?  Um, I like board games.  You know, like --
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  -- Monopoly.  I do a lot of, um, variety puzzles too.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] and penny press and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ...  
L:  Those are good.  
R:  I like doing those and my daddy taught me how to do cryptograms years ago and I do --
L:  My mom loves those.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She -- she has -- she and my dad have, um, [MN] well, my dad gets to do the crossword puzzle and my mom has to do the cryptogram and they --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- fight over who gets to do theirs first.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But ...
R:  That sounds like fun.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I can do some crossword puzzles but when they get to be that, um, New York puzzle, forget it.  
L:  Oh, I know.  I know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Those are terrible.  We -- we all, uh, my parents and my grandparents and pretty much everybody all gets together and has to input and we still usually can't get it done.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I like doing, um, [MN] ...  My sport's cooking.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, do you cook?
R:  Yeah.  I love to cook.  Um, in fact, I like, well, I've just started to like NASCAR racing.  Um ...
L:  [MN]  Oh, my, um -- yeah, yeah.  Do they have that up there?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  In fact, um, I would say that [LAUGH] the guy that I'm currently dating looks like Tony Stewart.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  He called me a while ago and I -- I told him, "So you won a race today".  He said, "Did I?"  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  He looks just like him.  I swear it.  But we went dancing one night and -- and the guy in the band he says, "Hey, we got Tony Stewart in here with us tonight".  [MN]
L:  Oh, so he really does look like him?
R:  Yeah.
L:  If other people notice it.  Huh.
R:  Everybody was looking around.  I was looking around.  I had [several inaudible words] recognize that, you know, then he said, "I'm talking to you".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's funny.
R:  So we call him Tony half the time but ...  
L:  That's funny.
R:  Um ...
L:  Did you watch the, um, the horse race, The Belmont, the other day?  I guess it was --
R:  I tried to.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  My -- my -- my mom's not really into sports and I sort of had to flick the TV.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I mean, it l- it just lasted l- like forty five seconds or something so ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]  I guess it's probably like a minute.  But I was, um, after the -- after the race they were showing the jockeys family over in the stands and, um, he had a little son who's probably seven or eight years old and he was in the stands crying after that -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- after Sunnyside didn't win.  It was really sad.
R:  Oh.  
L:  But ...  
R:  Yeah, we --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- used to watch horse racing all the time when I was little but ...
L:  Yeah.  We have a, um, race track in -- in Shreveport that I -- I really wished I'd a gone more once I, you know, turned twenty one, or however it is you have to [MN] be, but, um, really it's fun to go out there and, you know, bet like a dollar or two on a race and, you know, you don't lose much.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Be -- y- you know, you're at least interested in it -- in watching the races.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that was fun.  Uh ...
R:  I like playing checkers but I hate getting jumped.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  You know, when I'm playing checkers.  Um ...
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Chinese checkers?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I've never played that.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And chess.  I haven't really caught the grasp of yet.  I'm --
L:  I played chess a long time ago and I'm not sure I've ever actually understood all the rules.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And if I do I know I'm not very good at [LAUGH] it.
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, I know what a pawn looks like but when it gets to knights and --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and bishops, forget it.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  And I like playing solitaire.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  And Klondike.
L:  I do too.  Yeah.  
R:  And --
L:  On the computer?  That's a -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a good, uh, procrastination tool.
R:  Yeah.  I do that.  I do it on, satellite TV.  They have these games on satellite and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  They're free games and I would just sit there and play.  [LAUGH] [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And on, um, I just got a cellphone the other day with, you know, all the different games, snake and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cart racing or whatever and so that's [inaudible] --
R:  I like the one, um, bumper?  I think that's what it's called.  
L:  What's it called?
R:  Bumper?
L:  Bumper?
R:  It's a pinball --
L:  Is it --
R:  -- thing.  
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.  
R:  'Cause that --
L:  I don't know if mine has that on there.  
R:  I used to be good at pinball and, um, I really haven't played that much in a while and my mom cleans businesses and stuff and she cleans this bar and they have a pinball machine in there.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Speaking of lifeguards, it's got Baywatch on it and ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm sorry, I love David Hasselhoff.  I can't stand it.  But ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But the pinball machine I try to get on it, you know, and everything and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  It --
L:  I haven't played that one forever either.  
R: Mm.
L:  I watched a couple of friends of mine play it the other night.  But ...
R:  I'm like that --
L:  And --
R:  -- too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't played it in a while.  I --
L:  We actually went to this bar that's about to close, or it's about to move actually, and they played -- we went one night and they played a game on it and then, like, two or three nights later we went back and it -- the machine was already gone.
R:  Mm.
L:  Moved to the new location so ...  But ...
R:  That's awful.  
L:  Yeah.  And then ...  Trying to think of what other games and sports there are.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've never been snow skiing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Me neither.  And I'm, you know, my friend loves to skate but I'm afraid if I go on sk- skates I'll break everything in my body.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  And I watched -- I was watching one of those reality, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Real World, [inaudible] people getting hurt or whatever and it was, I don't know, there was a guy on a snowmobile who got in a horrible wreck and almost got, I don't know.  It was bad.  
R:  Mm.
L:  But ...
R:  I think some sports are -- are dangerous, you know.  But --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they look like they're fun too.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Do you ever water ski?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  I won't --
L:  Yeah.
