L:  So -- yeah, but --
R:  We gotta talk -- go ahead please.
L:  Uh, yeah, I mean, I was just saying that what kind of activities do you prefer, like the indoor activities or the outdoor or both kinds?
R:  [NOISE] I prefer -- I prefer outdoor activities.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Um ...
L:  Like what exactly?
R:  Uh, I like golfing, I like, uh, running, I like biking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I like, uh, uh, team sports.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, softball.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] I like, uh [SIGH] -- I like track and field.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, I guess, I don't know, just being outside, you don't have to worry about the, uh, messing up your pl- -- or, you know, uh, messing up your place in terms of dirt or -- or -- [NOISE] or -- or things of that nature, uh, just being outside --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- especially after, uh, gloomy weather and coming outside and it's nice and sunny [SIGH] and the -- the rain has washed the pollution down and it smells nice and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, that's right, mhm.
R:  You know.  Yeah.  And, um, you know, the -- and the sun actually is beneficial to the skin.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, in terms of, uh, um, [NOISE] uh, the melan[?] within your -- within, uh -- the melan within your skin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- acts as a protectant -- protectant and -- I don't know, I just -- I just love being outside, you know.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How 'bout the weather, like, uh, where do you live by?  What kind of weather are you used to?  More of the warm weather or the cold weather?
R:  Uh, well, I -- I'm in a, uh, a state that has four distinctive seasons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  From bitter cold --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mild summers, uh, to short springs and short -- short falls.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, uh ...
L:  W- where do you live by?  Which state?
R:  Minnesota.
L:  Pardon?
R:  Minnesota.
L:  Oh, Minnesota, okay.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Uh, I'm in Texas.
R:  Okay.  So you really only have two distinct [SIGH] -- you know, you --
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's more of -- of summer always.  Like, you know, uh, we never experience the bitter cold over here.  Uh, usually --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- usually it'll be warm or, like, very hot in, uh, summer.
R:  Yeah, and extremely hot [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  With high humidity?
L:  Hu- humidity is pretty much high because I stay close to the seacoast over here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that makes, uh --
R:  [inaudible] Houston? [PAUSE] Is it, like, Houston where you live?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I live in Houston.
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  So that we're like, you know, it's more of, uh, humid always in summer.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Uh, what sports do you enjoy?  I'm sorry, could you say your name again?
L:  Suman[?].
R:  [PAUSE] Okay.
L:  Yeah, it's Suman.  Uh, then, yeah, the thing is even -- I do prefer most outdoor activities over here.  Like, you know, that's the one thing which exposes you to more of, uh, more or less everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, yeah, I mean, oh, most of the times we do stay indoors so at least whenever the other activities are concerned so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would always like to go for the outdoor ones.
R:  [NOISE] Any in particular that you like outdoors? [NOISE]
L:  Well, uh, I keep going for, uh, hiking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- camping, and then like --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, or white water rafting, and I play soccer, tennis.  So, these kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- games, like, you know, more of outdoor rather than the indoor ones.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I kinda picked -- uh, myself, I kinda picked tennis up last year. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- and it is a -- it's, um, it's a good game.
L:  Yeah, that's right, we really enjoy playing it actually, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whenever you get some time in the evening after the work or sometime during the weekends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a nice game to, like, you know, to be with friends and then, like, you know, just go out and play for some time that way. [PAUSE] How 'bout you, do you have a family?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  I have, um -- have, uh, one boy, two girls --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, I like, uh -- and with my boy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we both picked up tennis at the same time and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he's getting to the point where he can almost beat me.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] And then my little girl, she likes being outside riding her bicycle.  And then I have one of those, uh, tow behind type carts --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that she rides in while I'm biking.  She likes that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, uh, we -- we enjoy being outside.  I -- I think it's very beneficial for kids to be outside for a couple of different reasons.  Number one, it's good to be exposed to the sun, not too much exposure --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's good for them to be exposed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the sun.  And also, I think it's good for them to be exposed -- to be outside --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I won't say playing in dirt but, you know, ju- -- right now they're building up  immunities in their young bodies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think being outside helps that and they're exposed to a lot of germs that, uh, their body will eventually build up immunities to and lessen their chances of getting sick as they get older.
L:  Yeah, that's right.  That's pretty much true.  Like, you know, when the body builds resistance in the beginning when the, uh, [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's when they can sustain it whenever something happens.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Now, I didn't catch the first thing she wanted us to talk about, but the second thing was they wanted us to state why -- what type of, uh -- what do we prefer, to be outdoors or indoors?
L:  Mhm.
R:  What was the first thing she said?
L:  Uh, it was basically about, uh, what kind of weather do you prefer, whether, uh, you -- you prefer the warm weather or the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cold weather?  That -- that was the first one which they said.
R:  Uh, personally, uh, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I grew up in Southern California.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we really only had, like, two really distinct, uh, seasons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That being, uh, summer and fall, basically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- it doesn't snow there so you don't have that, and spring is very short.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] but you do have the blooms, uh, the flowers blooming and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things greening up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But in California things kinda stay green --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause most of the plants are native plants that are quite hardy in terms of not requiring a lot of water or maintenance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  So it stays pretty green there, just like a evergreen tree or a cactou- cacti.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, but I would say that if ... uh, the weather that I probably would prefer would be -- would be the, uh, s- -- uh, California weather and to -- um, a- as far as the long summers --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and -- and basically long falls.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I've lived here in Minnesota twelve -- twelve years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I still haven't grown used to the very harsh winters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, you got temperatures that can swing from, uh, thirty degrees to, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- minus thirty.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Overnight, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, temperatures that are like -- that are extremely dangerous --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the human body.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and, uh, I still haven't grown that ... that, uh, that comfortable with the extreme --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, winters up here in Minnesota.
L:  So, you're --
R:  If I had my choice --
L:  -- you're really en- -- not enjoying the Minnesota weather much?
R:  Well, I mean, you make do with what you got but if I had a choice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would live in San Diego, that's got, like, perfect weather all year round.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That average -- that goes between sixty and eighty six degrees.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, about a -- about a ten or fifteen degree swing either way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  Or weather such as what you have.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, except for the summers are extreme.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, you know, you learn to deal with it.
L:  Yeah, that's -- summer's are very hot, oh, yeah, and then, uh, since I stay close to the seacoast, uh, it's pretty much humid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, but [inaudible] even the summer is too long over here.  I -- I really don't prefer this kind of weather actually.  Uh, I -- I stayed in Tennessee for quite some time and I, uh, I like the weather over there pretty much.
R:  You like colder -- you would like to have a little colder weather?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, the one in -- uh, I stayed in Tennessee for some time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The weather over there in Tennessee was pretty much a lot better than the one in Tex- --
