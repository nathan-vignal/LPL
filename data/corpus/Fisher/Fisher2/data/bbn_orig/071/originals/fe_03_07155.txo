L:  Hi, my name is Tran[?].
R:  Hi.  I'm Clarissa.  Can you hear me okay?
L:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, okay.  You're kind of quiet.  You sound really far [LAUGH] away.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  No, you're fine.  So do you like outdoor activities or indoor activities better?
L:  Um, outdoors.  Yeah. 
R:  Like what kind of stuff do you like to do.
L:  I like to play tennis.  [MN]  Well, I like indoor too.  But ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]  
R:  I think that, I don't know, a lot of the activities that I like to do are normally outdoor activities, but I live in Washington and it's really cold up here so they tend to be indoor activities.
L:  Oh, I live in California.  It's like, kind of, cold right now.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Some days it's like really hot and some days it's like really cold.
R:  Yeah.  It's been really hot this last week.  Um, like all the swimming pools in Washington are inside because, um, our swimming season is at the beginning of, like, the school year.  And, um, so the swimming pools are inside because that's when it rains all the time and it's cold and it's nasty.  Um, and so this last week [inaudible] was like, "I want an outdoor swimming pool" but there aren't really whole lot of those.  [LAUGH]  So if we want to swim outside we have to go to a lake or something.
L:  [LAUGH]  I can't swim.  [LAUGH]  [MN]  I like to go fishing.  Kinda like a boys sport.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.  My -- I used to go fishing a lot when my parents were married, and then my parents got divorced and my dad left and we stopped fishing.  
L:  Oh.  You don't go with your, like, friends or brothers and sisters?
R:  Um, well my brother is kind of a recluse and doesn't like to go outside.  [LIPSMACK]  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, my sister is, uh, pretty girly girl and [MN] likes to get dressed up and wear cute clothes and make up and hang out with her boyfriend.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, uh, we don't go fishing with her.  And, uh, most of my friends are not really into fishing.  I have one friend who -- who I think might be but we've never gone fishing together.  
L:  Do you like snowboarding?
R:  I've never been snowboarding.  And it's really funny, 'cau- -- -kay, I live in Washington.  Everybody --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- in Washington goes skiing and snowboarding.  I have lived up here for ten years and I've never done anything else other than, like, sledding or inner tubing or anything on a mountain.  Like I don't know how to ski or snowboard.  
L:  I haven't snowboard but I went skiing and it's so fun.  But when you fall down it's like so hard to get up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  One of my really good friends went skiing and he crashed into a tree.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And was like -- he had to spend like nine months recovering.  It was pretty bad.  So he wears a helmet now.  And he's a big advocate for [LAUGH] wearing a helmet when you go --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- skiing.  
L:  I went on a chairlift and, um, it looked so scary getting off I never got off.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  
R:  Yeah, there's a lot of, um, I work for a youth ministry.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And there's a lot of youth activities up here that are -- are centered around, like, winter sports like that.  And there's like ski buses and, um, you can sign up for a ski school, um, with the school, like the public school you go to.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, like, it costs extra and then on Saturday's, like, you take a bus up to the mountain and go learn how to ski and stuff.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  But --
L:  I went to Washington once and we went camping there and it rained and there was like all these [several inaudible words].
R:  Where did you go?
L:  Um, I don't remember.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.  
R:  Good deal.
L:  I just remember it rained.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it rains here a lot.  
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  But it rains in Florida more. [LAUGH]   
L:  Really?  I haven't been there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?  I've never been to Florida either but that's [MN] -- everybody's like Washington rains too much.  We're like, yeah, but it rains more in Florida.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [MN]
L:  How old are you?
R:  I am twenty.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  How hold are you?
L:  Twenty three.  
R:  You're how old, sorry?
L:  Huh?
R:  How old are you, I'm sorry?
L:  Twenty three.
R:  Twenty three?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Good deal.  Cool.  So did you do, like, sports in high school or college or anything?
L:  I only played tennis.  
R:  Did you play tennis on, like, a sports team or ...?
L:  No.  
R:  No, that's cool.
L:  I'm not that good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?  Yeah.  I've -- I never --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- really learned how to play tennis.  Like the rules of tennis.  Like we've gone out with, like, rackets and like hit balls at each other before 'cause that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fun and a lot of communities up here have, like, a neighborhood tennis court.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm not really good at tennis.  
L:  Someone hit me with the ball.  I was, like, not paying attention.  I was talking to my friends and they [inaudible] right on my face.  I'm like, "Ow, that hurts".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's so good.  Where in California do you live at?
L:  L.A.
R:  L.A.  Okay.  I have a bunch of family that lives in Southern California, like in Santa Barbara and San Diego and, um, [inaudible] and stuff.  
L:  Oh, I have some cousins that live in the middle.  In Oregon.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Good deal.  So do you like cold weather activities or hot weather activities better?
L:  I like the hot weather.  
R:  Yeah.  I think that, like, as far as weather goes I would prefer cold weather to hot weather.  'Cause it's been really hot this week and I'm not a big fan of being really hot.  Um, but there are -- I don't know.  'Cause like everything's indoors here 'cause it's always cold so.  I don't know, like, swimming is an indoor sport.
L:  And you get tired of being inside?
R:  Do I get tired of being inside?  Um, well, no, 'cause like we go outside.  We just don't play sports outside a lot.  Like a lot [MN] -- like our sports stadiums.  Like most of them --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are covered.  We have this really cool field though where the -- the Seattle Mariners play.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, and I live in Kirkland, which is like twenty minutes from Seattle.  So, like, we'll go watch the Mariners play and it's got like this cool retractable roof.  So when it rains or snows or something, like, the roof is on top of it.  And --
L:  [MN] 
R:  But if it's nice outside they can pull the roof back and there's no roof.  So baseball's kind of an indoor sport.  And the stadium we had before that just had a roof.  It wasn't open air at all.
L:  Do you like hockey?
R:  Do I like hockey?  Like ice hockey?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have never played hockey.
L:  I like [inaudible] hockey.  It's pretty fun.
R:  Yeah, I played -- we played like gym hockey.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  When I was in junior high.
L:  Yeah, we did that too.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But in high school.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think --
L:  Do you like to ice skate?
R:  What?
L:  Ice skate?
R:  Ice skate?  The first time I went ice skating was this last Christmas actually, and we went in California.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, in northern California.  I went down to California for Christmas.  
L:  The first time I went was in Hawaii and it's so hard to go round.  You keep falling.
R:  Yeah, I went with one of my -- my really good friends and he's -- he's a guy and he's a lot bigger than me and it was funny 'cause he's, like, holding me up for, like, the first forty five minutes that we were doing it.  Like going in the circle and he's holding me.  It was really funny.
L:  [LAUGH]  I keep --
R:  I wasn't very good.
L:  -- falling into this little kid.  He got all mad.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He was trying to get back.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's funny.  Yeah, we went --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  There was two rinks at the place where we were at and we went and skated on the kids' rink.  [LAUGH]  So that I wouldn't get in everybody's way 'cause I didn't know how to ice skate.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was --
L:  You really [several inaudible words] probably looking at you all weird, huh?
R:  Yeah, it was a little -- it was really funny.  Well, there were like me and my friend and we're both in our twenties and, um, all these little kids and their parents teaching their little kids how to ice skate.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was funny.  
L:  I go in the baby area when I go to the swimming pools 'cause I don't want to drown.  
R:  [LAUGH]  How come you don't know how to swim?
L:  I just don't really like water.  
R:  Huh.
L:  'Cause, like, I don't like getting in there.  
R:  Did you have like a traumatic experience when you were little with being in the water?
L:  Kinda.  [inaudible] [NOISE] raging waters and then, like, you know, when you go down the slide really fast --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and where like this currents on the bottom and, like, I can't get up, you know.  So I was trying to get the lifeguard to help me but he's like, "Get out the water".  I'm like, "I'm trying to".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no.  
L:  Yeah. [several inaudible words].
R:  How old were you when that happened?
L:  Eleven.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Huh.  Yeah, though I really like to swim 'cause I was on -- I was on the swim team when I was in high school and then, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I started lifeguarding when I was a -- a senior in high school and so I did that for a year, and then I did that at a girl scout summer camp.  And I think my certification just expired 'cause I stopped, um --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- lifeguarding so I could go to school full time.  
L:  Cool.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like when I go to the beach I don't want to go near the water.  [LAUGH]  My friends always try to throw me in there.  I'm like, "Quit it" because I'm, like, light, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  The water scares me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So have you ever --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- thought about learning how to swim just so that, like, if you ever --
L:  I tried.
R:  -- fell in the water or something happened you could get up.
L:  I tried when I was, like, fourteen or fifteen but I don't like the water going up my nose and [inaudible].  I can't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- see in the water so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think it's like a good feeling.  I like to swim life, um, jackets and everything or go with people who know how to swim.  
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Save me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Good deal.
L:  I like to go on those paddleboats where you paddle.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like where you like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- paddle like a bike and it moves the paddle?
L:  But in the water.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  But it's like I'm so scared I might fall off or something.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I really like canoeing.  Canoeing and boating is fun.  When I worked at the girl scout camp we, um, we had a lot of canoes and different row boats and stuff, and my dad's in the Coastguard so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, grew up on boats and stuff.  And we actually -- my dad and I built a [MN] canoe when I was -- how old was I?  Like nine or ten.  I was pretty little.  So, yeah, we built this canoe out of wood strips and it was pretty cool.  It's like we'll take that and go fishing and, well, we used to go fishing in it.  We haven't gone fishing in a long time but we would take that and go paddling and ...  [LIPSMACK]  So I like canoeing.  Canoeing is fun.  I guess that's a sport.  That'd be an outdoor sport during warm weather.  You don't want to go canoeing when it's cold.  Generally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not fun.  Yeah, 'cause of the water.  Like during the winter it gets like darn cold and if you fall in the water it's like you get hypothermic really quick.
