L:  Oh, I love -- I love bicycling.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, g- great.  Do -- do you use the mountain bike or the regular?
L:  I have -- well, I -- I sometimes -- a friend of mine has a mountain bike, so sometimes I'll use hers, but I -- I have, like, a -- an older -- it's an older --

R:  [NOISE] Oh, so you like to go on the pavement?
L:  Yeah, I like to -- I like to -- well, I mean, I live in a small town so usually when I leave my apartment I'll go into town to, like, you know, go to the post office or something like that, and I'll ride my bike on the street.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  But sometimes I'll ride on -- on some trails, 'cause there's some bike trails around here that are sort of bumpy, so then I use my friend's mountain bike.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  And so -- and you can go with your friends?
L:  Yeah, sometimes I go -- sometimes we go bike riding.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Um, I -- I teach my girlfriend how to bike.

L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE] She's better than me but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but -- but be- before she -- but she'll teach me other things.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] But, um, I like also to, um, to play basketball, but it doesn't matter where it is, outdoor or indoor.
L:  Well, I think they said -- well, they said that, you know, do you like to -- when you play basketball, do you like to play it outside or inside?
R:  Oh, like to play it in- inside.
L:  Inside?  Yeah.  I like to -- I play some -- I play badminton sometimes and I play that inside in a gym.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I -- I find that really I don't -- I don't spend too much time doing out- outdoor activities except for, like, bike riding and swimming.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And sometimes playing volleyball, I guess.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, volleyball.  Uh, do you play, uh, under the, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what do they call that, um ... [NOISE] the, um, I don't know [inaudible].  But anyway, um, so you -- you know how to serve?

R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] -- I try my best.
R:  Yeah, but -- [NOISE] yeah, long as it keeps the [inaudible], no?
L:  Yeah.  So, do you like -- do you like doing activities, like sports and stuff, outside during the summer or the winter?
R:  [NOISE] Um, I guess I'll go with, uh, with the summer, yeah, because here the winter sometime is --
L:  Yeah.  Some people like to go skiing a lot, but I hate -- I kind of hate the cold weather so ...
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  I mean, I don't -- I mean, I'll go -- I'll go out to, like, jump in my car or, you know, ride the bus or something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, you know, I'd -- I'd hate to really go out there to play a game or something.  We went sled riding this winter but that's about it. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] So, uh --
L:  That's kind of like the only, uh, outdoor activity you can do that's fun [MN] in the winter.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, have you ever tried, uh, going from the mountain -- not mountain but those, like, the -- the ones they made to go, um -- the one that, um --
L:  Oh, yeah, with the fake snow?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, no, no, no.  Just the real, uh, snow but where they take you up -- up -- up top and then you go down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] With many people.
L:  I've been -- I've been skiing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And that was kind of fun.  It was, um ...
R:  [NOISE] Uh, but -- but those are different, skiing and going from the mountain, no?  Ski --
L:  Yeah, you can go on top -- you can go on top -- you can go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ski boa- -- skiing and snowboarding on top of the mountain.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  But it's kind of like I'm not very -- I'm not a very good athlete, so I fell down a lot and it hurt. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  Yeah, I kept -- I kept falling down on my way down skiing. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, I see. [MN] Yeah, but you should try it again [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, I think that I will probably try it again.  I tried it -- I tried it this past winter and it was one -- it was my second time.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So I think that I'll probably get better at it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, definitely.  And did you try go from the smaller mountain first?
L:  Yeah, first I tried -- well, my dad had talked me into going [LAUGH] and -- to this really tall one, so I went on that one first and I was scared to death.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  No, your dad?
L:  Yeah, he's -- he's -- he's always doing stuff like that to me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He's a troublemaker and, um, but later on I did go from, like, a smaller mountain and -- like, the kid mountain. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  The one that they teach kids how to go down, then I felt a lot better about it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible] and, um, so do you like -- oh, so you don't like -- I like, uh, going skating, ice skating.  Do you do that?
L:  Oh, ice skating, yeah, ice skat- -- I've only been ice skating a couple of times.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But it's pretty fun.  I'm kind of scared about --
R:  [NOISE] Falling?
L:  Yeah, 'cause it -- 'cause I -- you know, I haven't been ice skating very much and whenever I do go I always fall really hard and I'm afraid of, like, breaking an arm or a leg or something. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible].
L:  I try to be kind of cautious around ice. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I see, I see.  Because the ice, like, don't forgive you if you fall.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, it's not like if you fall on the ground and there's some grass or there's some dirt.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If you fall on the ice you really could get hurt if you fall hard enough.
R:  [NOISE] I -- I -- mine is -- rule is, like, always the head the most important, so whatever, just protect the head.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] going backwards [inaudible]. [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] So, um, so you like this -- you are, like, a warm type person? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, pretty much.
R:  [NOISE] So, have you -- oh, so, let's see, but in -- in, um, [LIPSMACK] -- so you -- now you're in Pennsylvania? [MN]
L:  I'm in -- I'm -- I'm from Pennsylvania, but I live in Ohio right now.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, Ohio, is it Midwest?
L:  Yeah.  It's -- well, it's like one -- it's like next to -- it's right next to Pennsylvania, so it's New York --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes.
L:  -- Pennsylvania, Ohio.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?  Ohio is next to it?  Oh.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's about ten hours from New York City.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really.  And you also --
L:  If I was driving.
R:  [NOISE] Uh, let's see, like, so like six hundred miles?
L:  Yeah, something -- I think it's, um, yeah, something like five hundred, maybe six hundred.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, then [inaudible].  So, in -- in the -- the weather -- weather is [NOISE] -- is it, like, cold there or -- or on average warmer?
L:  No, it's -- it's pretty similar to New York.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  It's pretty similar 'cause it's around the same --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's around the same temperature line so I think that it's a little less, like I think New York's warmer in the summer.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  But, um, I think that Ohio is a little colder in the winter.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  So, I think it's -- I think it's -- it's pretty similar, though.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  And -- and have you decided to -- to move, like, south since you like the ...

L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] Maybe -- but they be okay.  It's like, uh -- it's not private, it's just from --
L:  Yeah, I went to -- I went to, um, before I -- I went to my other college I went to, like, a community college.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, like, by my mom's house when I was living with her, and so that was pretty cool.  They had a lot of classes.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, they --
L:  And it was -- and it was really -- it was really affordable.
