L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Where are you?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Where are you?
R:  Okay.  I'm in California.
L:  California?  Oh.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  And, um, I kind of came in, in the middle.  Was the, uh, the person who was on the phone, was she saying we were supposed to talk about the corporate scandals --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and the crimes, uh, of CEOs in the government?
L:  Uh, yes, and how it affects us, if it does and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And all that.  And what the government can do to prevent that from happening.
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you have some ideas?
L:  Um, I'm not sure how they can prevent [LAUGH] it.  [LAUGH]  I know they need to do more, um, more, [LIPSMACK] um, checks on these businesses to make sure that their books are -- are right.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean --
R:  And I think that the people who are, uh, high in command should be, um, [LAUGH] I don't want to say thrown in [LAUGH] jail.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, definite -- what, no I agree.
R:  And the other part is that they still leave with so much money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when the people who they've stolen that money from have no way to get it back so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that, uh, all of us would really feel better about our government if they legislated some way for those men who received those tremendous salaries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- were forced to return a portion to -- of it to all of the people who lo- lost their retirement.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  [MN]  Yeah, definitely.
R:  I mean, be creative.  I'm not sure exactly --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what the government could do but I feel the government has overlooked it and, in that way, bears some of the blame for what's happened.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they need to be creative and correct it somehow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We just never see the p- the wealthy people being punished.
L:  No, not like the -- the poorer people [LAUGH] are.  That's --
R:  No. 
L:  I mean, a -- a -- a guy you steals a hundred dollars from someone holding --
R:  It's true.
L:  -- up a convenience store ends up with a lot more punishment than these --
R:  Right.
L:  -- criminals.
R:  And when he was just trying to feed his family.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It -- well, it must obvi- it's obviously worth the -- the risk to -- for corporate crime.  I mean, these people make --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oh, sometimes more than they have to pay back.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So they end up benefiting even --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- with -- with --
R:  Yeah.  And they continue to own, like, four or five homes and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they just have to sell one or two.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
R:  It -- it's really dreadful.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Anyway, what's happening in Wisconsin today?  Is it a nice day?
L:  Um, yeah, for -- w- we're not supposed to have it for much longer.  It's supposed to start raining --
R:  Oh, [MN] --
L:  -- pretty quick here.
R:  -- yeah.  I understand the east coast is raining.
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Um ...
L:  I haven't checked. 
R:  Do you get very cold winters and hot summers?
L:  Um, well we used to -- it seems like we used to get a lot colder [LAUGH] winters than we do lately.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we -- we get pretty cool.  Usually -- it's not unusual to be in the teens and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- zero.
R:  And how 'bout the summer?
L:  The what?
R:  The summers.
L:  The summer?  Well, anywhere from eighty to a hundred.  Somewhere in that +area usually.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Not too bad.  But it's very m- -- humid.  It's not a dry heat.  It's --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I used --
L:  It's a humid heat.
R:  -- to live on the east coast and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it was very humid then.
L:  Mhm.  It's pretty much the same here.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Got a lot of lakes.
R:  Do you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you live in a big community?
L:  Um.  Green Bay, Wisconsin.  It's --
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's -- 
L:  It's fairly big.
R:  That's a really nice place.
L:  Oh, I like it.  I like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it a lot.  
R:  You've lived there all your life?
L:  Um, with- within the [MN] -- the general area.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's [MN] very nice.  I like it.  [MN]  I like the -- the, um, that we have the woods and things nearby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If we feel like going --
R:  And do you have family close --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- to you?
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  So they didn't move away?
L:  Um, only one of us did.  But he's in Wisconsin [LAUGH] so he's -- he's --
R:  He is then.
L:  -- still close.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just a couple hours drive away but ...
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  We're mostly in -- in Wisconsin here.  Nobody wants to move away.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Is -- well, I think, that's wonderful.  That's nice --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when families are close to each other.
L:  Mhm.  I -- I like it.  Definitely.  Makes it a lot easier.
R:  How did you hap- how did you happen to find this person who's making this, uh, these telephone calls?
L:  Um, I'm a part of this group -- this, uh, on the internet this R.M.C. it's called.  It's a refunding and rebating group.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I signed up.  I learned of this through there and I signed up for it.  
R:  Oh.  What is --
L:  Did you --
R:  What is the name of the site?
L:  Um.  [MN]  Refunding makes cents.
R:  Refunding ma- mix -- makes cents?
L:  Makes cents.  Yes.  It's, uh, it's about -- people just share information on how to save money.  Couponing and refunding and doing rebates and ...
R:  Oh, that's good.  I'll have to look it up.
L:  Uh, it's very interesting.  I -- I've saved a lot of money.
R:  Really?
L:  Lots of money, yes.
R:  Well, I've only had my computer about three weeks and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I'm kind of afraid to sign up for anything.
L:  Yeah, you gotta be careful what you sign up for.
R:  What -- how -- do you sign up for things that cost money?
L:  Well, this -- the -- the site that I signed up -- the refunding makes cents, to be a member it does cost money but you get a magazine and everything.  It's -- it's only like twelve dollars a year.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the money that I've made on that site has really --
R:  Made more.
L:  -- made way more.  In the first month I made way more than --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- what I put into it.  
R:  I see.
L:  Just things like this.
R:  So when I go [MN] looking for this site, if they say, uh, to sign on you have to pay twelve dollars a year?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then I'll just do it.  
L:  Well, I mean, it's -- it would be your choice.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can explore it and there's different -- they tell you different people who've done different things too.
R:  Well, it just sounds so interesting.  Just like my talking to you is interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes, it is interesting.  Is there --
R:  Have you -- have you done this a lot?
L:  This is my third call.
R:  Oh, this is my third call too.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] is it?
R:  I think that's all they give you, is three, isn't it?
L:  I think so.  But I -- I -- I'm not certain.  I ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Not a hundred --
R:  Do --
L:  -- percent certain on [LAUGH] anything.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Do you have a family?
L:  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, I --
R:  Children?
L:  [MN]  One, yeah.  
R:  Ho- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wha- what is it? 
L:  It's a four year old --
R:  Is it a boy or a girl?
L:  Four year old girl.
R:  Oh, you're so lucky.  
L:  Oh, she's so fun.  I love [LAUGH] her.
R:  I know.  It is just --
L:  We were just learning how to read and -- a li- little bit before the call came in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are -- are you working also?
L:  Yes.  I work full time.  [MN]
R:  That's hard, isn't it?
L:  It -- it can be.  Oh, it definitely can be.  Long days.
R:  But have you figured out how to make that work and still be a good mom?
L:  Oh, I think I'm a good mom.  I -- I'd --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- love to be home with her though.  I mean then I could be a better mom.
R:  Yeah, so is she in daycare?
L:  Right now she stays home with her dad.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's -- I think that's the best.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it -- it works for now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, because she --
L:  I would like to be the one, but ...
R:  Yeah, but she's learning to have a relationship with her father.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  I mean, I never did that.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh.
R:  And I think that's a really good thing to learn.
L:  Yeah, I think that's great.  I mean, she's -- they spend all day together doing different activities and going to Chucky Cheese.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's so nice.  I'm happy for her.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's good.  Um, are you a secretary?
L:  Um, no actually I work for an insurance company.  A health insurance company.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  
L:  I process, um, insurance claims.
R:  Claims.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, my heavens.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Those things are bothersome to us.
L:  Oh, they can be confusing.  They definitely can be.
R:  They're very confusing and, I guess, when you're sick and you have to fill out those claims it's kinda aggravating.
L:  Most of the time the providers fill them out for the patients.  
R:  They do?
L:  And they send them in.  Yeah.  So your -- your health insurance usually receives claims from -- from the providers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, then it sounds like you work for a good company too.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [MN]
R:  Uh, it's a nationally known company.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  One of the bigger --
R:  -- they pay their claims.
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]  Most of the time.  Unless it's something that we don't cover.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  It's -- it's a good -- it's a good job.  I enjoy it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Fun.  
R:  What other fun things have you done on this s- site where, uh, you get refunds and things?
L:  Um, basically, people just share information.  Um, like when the cou- coupon inserts come in on Sunday -- on Sunday papers?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, if there's a deal at K Mart where you end up taking the coupon over there and you get something for free they'll tell you that you can do this.  You can take this coupon over to K Mart and get this for free, right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then you can run over there and get it for free with the coupon.  [several inaudible words] dollar coupon.
R:  Oh, my [MN] -- do they give you the coupons?
L:  No.  You have to get the coupons yourself through your Sunday papers but ...
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  But it's -- it's nice.
R:  Oh.  I've never --
L:  And then --
R:  -- gotten anything free.  That sounds --
L:  There's ways --
R:  -- good.
L:  -- to get more coupons then on the internet so you can get ten of a coupon and then --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- bring it to K Mart and get ten free toothpastes or ten free body washes, or whatever.
R:  Oh, my heavens.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Very nice.  It's a nice way to s- save money.  
R:  Oh, I really like that.  I -- I thank you for giving me the name of that site.
L:  Oh, that's not a problem.  Hopefully you'll join and I'll hear from you on there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm going to.  Refunding makes --
L:  Refunding makes cents.
R:  -- cents.
L:  As in C.E.N.T.S.  
R:  Oh, C.E.N.T.  I'm glad you told --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- me.
