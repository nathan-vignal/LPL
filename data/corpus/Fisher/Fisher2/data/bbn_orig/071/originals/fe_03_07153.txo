R:  Uh, Dorothea.
L:  Yes.  My name is Sherry.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Um, I'm from Pennsylvania.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Uh, I'm from Mississippi.  In the southern -- 
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  The southern state.
L:  We're from up north.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you are?  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah, we've had an unusually ugly spring and -- and [LAUGH] last winter.  It -- we had a lot of snow and it was very cold.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And now this spring has been really, really rainy so it's kind of hard to get outside to do anything.
R:  Mhm.  Well, in Mississippi we didn't have any cold weather but we have a lot of storm and everything and it's been raining like crazy.
L:  Yeah, we've got a lot of [LAUGH] rain.  
R:  Mhm.  And so, uh, I like the warm weather better than I do the cold.
L:  Oh, yes, I do too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm tired of being cold.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  And I -- I really don't go outside that much unless I have something to do to my yard.  Other than that I stay on the inside of my house and I love to cook.  And that's my favorite -- favorite hobby.  And so, uh, I stay on the internet too, every now and then.  But, uh ...
L:  Yes, I get in trouble for being on the internet so much. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  I enjoy going outside to work, like, working in my yard with flowers and everything.  I really enjoy doing that.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my kids play baseball in the spring.  And they play soccer in the fall, so I'm usually sitting on a baseball or soccer field [LAUGH] somewhere.  
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  But I don't really get to do a lot of outdoor activities like, you know, some people go skiing or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- swimming or something.  I don't really have time to do that with my kids and everything.  
R:  Oh, I don't either because, uh, I work at nighttime.  In the daytime I have to, uh, get my sleep and so, uh, I really don't hardly see the outside that much.  So I'm mostly only on the inside so, uh ...
L:  Right.  My husband works night shift too.  He works eleven to seven.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's kind of hard for him too.  Because like in the summertime now, since my kids are out of school, it's [LAUGH] hard for him to sleep during the day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So he's kind of up and down often [LAUGH] all day long.
R:  Yeah, I know.  And so, uh, like I said, cold weather, I'm just not used to it.  I'm trying to get used to it but I can't.  I'm just a cold natured p- person.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  My husband says I have ice in my veins.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, gosh.  
L:  I have a warm heart though.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  He calls me the ice queen.  He said you go everywhere with a coat, even if it's seventy degrees.  It's like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you're right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Uh-huh.  Ice cream.  I'll eat that too much either.  You know, like I say, I am very cold in nature.  Anything -- I wear a jacket in the summertime and so, like I said, it is -- cold weather is not for me.  Warm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- weather, yeah.  I'm crazy about it.  And so like, uh, when I see the, uh, the sun is shining, I be at work.  I say, "Oh, my God, I don't want to be here.  I want to go home".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Don't see the sunshine too much though.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's usually cloudy --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Or ugly here.  It's always pouring down rain.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We've got --
R:  Lately --
L:  -- five inches of rain this sum- -- this month already.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  But lately, uh, we've been having nice weather, you know, for this weekend and everything so ...  It's supposed to be starting raining sometime this week.  And so, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  
L:  Yeah, it just started raining here a while ago.  And I hear the thunder so it's like, oh no, it's coming again.
R:  Uh-huh.  But it's been nice today.  The weather been real pretty and so, um, my kids they're not that crazy about outside either because, you know, since it's nice it's all -- the mosquito is bad.  
L:  Oh, no.  
R:  Yeah.  They are terrible here.  You know.  You have to wear this all insect repellent, you know, for to go outside and it's just bad.
L:  We have tics.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  We have problems with tics.  We live in the woods.  And my kids like to go outside.  Like they do a lot of, like, outside biking and that kind of stuff.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they go for walks up in the woods and everything, but there's so many tics anymore.  My son's like a tic magnet.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  As soon as he goes outside he comes around [inaudible] again, "Mom, I got a tic".
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- nobody else seems like that they get 'em.  It's just [LAUGH] my son.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Ew, I can't stand them, you know.  We got 'em too.  My dogs.  They go out -- I -- they're, you know, and they have 'em on there.  And you gotta get some powder and stuff and [MN] spray it on them so they won't have, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be so full of them and they hairy and everything.  And so, like I said, [LIPSMACK] cold weather's not for me.  
L:  No, I like to stay in.  I -- I try to keep my house fairly, you know, in decent clean condition and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I do a lot of inside stuff.  I like to read.  I like to tinker around on the computer.  And I like to do cross stitch and a lot of stuff like that.  Usually the weather is so ugly anymore you don't really get too many nice days that you can go outside and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- do anything.  
R:  Mhm.  And then when I do have a little spare time I probably go in there and turn the TV on and watch, uh, Dr. Phil or someone, then O- Oprah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I love to see his show, you know.  He has some good talk, you know.  Interested people on his show that they have problem about.  I like to listen to him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, uh, [LIPSMACK] that about it, you know.  Other than that once I watch his show, or either Oprah, I just go in there and just lay down for a couple of hours and the next thing I know I be ready to go to work.  
L:  Well ...
R:  And so it just -- a busy day for me.  
L:  Yeah, I can believe it.  I don't work right now.  I just stay home with my kids.  But it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm so busy, like I volun- --
R:  Well, I'm quite sure you still [LAUGH] [inaudible]. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I volunteer at my kids' school so I spend a lot of time over there several times a week.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's, you know, three or four hours a week over there at their schools and, like I say, they play sports so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH]  When I am outside I'm [LAUGH] usually sitting on a bleacher somewhere w- watching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- them play ball.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't really get to do much activity myself.  It's usually stuff for the kids.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's a lot of running them around and when I'm actually home it's -- I don't really have much time to be outside.  It's like, well, I gotta get my housework done.  I'm behind on clothes and behind on dishes and ...
R:  Right.  
L:  You're trying to get all that stuff done and try to keep everybody fed and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The housework is just [SIGH] ...
R:  Oh, it -- it's just like a twenty four hour job.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  That's what that [LAUGH] is.  
L:  I know.  I have two kids and my husband and he's like a little baby.  He's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- really, really messy and you got to pick up everything from behind him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's really hard to keep after your housework, but that's usually why I end up doing in the house.
R:  Right.  Now when I have time, like I if I take off or something like that, 'cause like I said, I enjoy cooking.  I love to try different recipes and everything.  If I see something that sound good, believe it or not, I'm gonna try that recipe.  I'll either go to the store and buy the, uh, the, uh, ingredient that I need.  I'm coming back home and [inaudible] try that [LAUGH] recipe.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh. 
R:  [LAUGH]  So I like cooking.  I don't know [LAUGH] why.  But --
L:  I like to cook but I don't like to clean up the mess.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]  [MN] I have to because if I don't my kids is not gonna do it, so I go ahead and wash everything back up, you know, what I dirty and so ...  And so, that's it.  
L:  You know, I cooked Thanksgiving meal this year --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I did not realise it was that much work.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  And my husband's aunt and uncle came over and my daughter -- my oldest daughter's boyfriend came over.  And I couldn't believe the amount of dishes [LAUGH] and everything that that made.  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And just cleaning up all the food and everything.  It was, like, wow, I can't believe this.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I spent a couple of hours just cleaning off the [LAUGH] table --  
R:  Right.  
L:  -- and putting leftovers [LAUGH] away.  
R:  Mhm.  And so I'm just thank God that I do have a dishwasher.
L:  Yep.
R:  I say, I wouldn't [inaudible] wash 'em by hand, you know.  I said, mhm.  And so I said I'm just gonna turn this thing on and [LAUGH] it's gonna help me out this [LAUGH] time.  
L:  [MN]  Yeah, I know.  We built our house four years ago.  I told my husband, I said, "You are buying me a dishwasher.  I have washed --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- dishes long enough".  [LAUGH]: 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Of course, you still gotta do --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- some of the plastic stuff and everything but ...
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, [MN] most everything that's glass or silverware or anything, that stuff goes in the dishwasher.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  It's just like the holidays and everything, it's like you were saying Thanksgiving, and during Christmastime, I go ahead and cook but I have the, uh, the paper plates.  So they can go ahead and eat and just throw away and, like, anything else, like if they have drinks -- well I get the cups too.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they just throw away everything.  So the --
L:  And it --
R:  -- only thing they will have to wash is the, uh, utensils and stuff.  The [LAUGH] spoon.
L:  My husband's aunt's really, really picky.  She's like really high class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she would never use the paper plates and everything, so I kind of like took a step down from -- from her fancy dishes and I used the plastic ones.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I used, like, the solo cups and everything.  I thought, well --
R:  Yeah, that's what I use too.  
L:  Yeah and I -- I said, well, at the end of it then at least I didn't have all that stuff to mess with.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I just trashed all the plastic stuff and --
R:  Right.
L:  I asked her if that was okay when she -- when we were done then.  She said, "Oh, yeah, that was fine".  I said, well I wasn't sure because --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- she's so picky.  You know, she uses the cloth napkins and she has, like, little, little salad fork and the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- two different spoons and ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like I'm not putting all these extra --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- dishes on my table.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not for the holidays anyway.
L:  Yeah, she has like the coffee cup and she has
