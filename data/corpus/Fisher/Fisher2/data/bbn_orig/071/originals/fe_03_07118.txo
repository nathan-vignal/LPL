L:  Hi, I'm Ginger.
R:  Hi, this is Deborah.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Okay.  
L:  Good.  I did not catch the topic at --
R:  Oh.
L:  At [LAUGH] all, really.
R:  Okay.  The topic is, um, corporate scandal.  And --
L:  Corporate --
R:  Yeah.  Um, you know, like the, uh, Enron --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- kind of thing.
L:  Okay.  
R:  And how it affects you?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Uh.  
R:  Doesn't really affect me but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  No, it didn't affect me at all.  I mean [MN] [LAUGH] 
R:  But I guess that, you know, like what are your opinions on it?  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, it's funny because I was asked to fill out a questionnaire about that sometime ago and, um, you know, basically, you know, they basic- -- were asking like how much control do you think corporates have on America?  And how does it affect us?
L:  Huh.
R:  And I responded that I think they have a lot of control.  Because they kind of are very involved with government --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and politics because of their influence and their money.  So, um, you know, I think that it does affect us.
L:  I guess so.  Um, I -- I really don't keep up with politics.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have two kids --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- one and two.  And --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's about my life.  I --
R:  I know.
L:  -- should.  [MN] 
R:  I know.  No, I agree with you totally because I have a son and even before that though, um -- you know, my son's only nineteen months but --
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  -- I'm not really big on news.  My husband always criticizes me about it because I --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- don't really, you know, I don't tune in.  I don't watch the news on TV.
L:  Yeah.  No.
R:  I don't listen to it on the radio.  I don't read the paper.
L:  [LAUGH]  Me neither.
R:  And that --
L:  My mom gets on to me.  And she's like -- uh, yesterday she told me that, oh, some kid got locked in the car over here and she told me that the kid died.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was like, oh, that's so sad.  What kid?
R:  [MN]
L:  And she's like, "Ginger, you've got to read the news and --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  " [MN] watch it".  
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But I --
R:  And to me I feel like it's just -- a lot of the media is scandal, you know, where they just want you to --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- tune in.
L:  Right.
R:  So they really kind of, you know, uh, exaggerate things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, I don't know how accurate it is a lot of times.  And it's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- saddening to me.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and it -- [MN] the same with me.  It's like if they're gonna not play fair and -- and tell us the truth and tell us the important things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then I'm not gonna watch it and figure it out for myself.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I don't have time to do that.  
R:  Yeah, and not only that it's just, you know, like I said, it's saddening.  It's also upsetting to me.  And especially since I have this nineteen month old, it's like the more I tune into it the more frightened I get.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I kind of want to stay in my own little world.
L:  [LAUGH]  Right. Right.
R:  [MN]  You know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially when it comes to foreign affairs because I just -- it's very upsetting to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what's going on.  And, um, you know, so sometimes I really just want to stay, um, out of the loop.
L:  Yeah.  It's like when the [MN] bombings happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I d- -- I had days where I didn't turn off the TV, and that's very rare for me.  I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- usually --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- have the TV going from sunup to sundown on cartoons or whatever.  
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you know, I -- I just didn't want to hear it.  
R:  Yeah.  Are --
L:  And --
R:  -- you talking about, uh, the recent bombings?
L:  Yeah, well, nine eleven.  I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, nine eleven.  Yeah.
L:  Or [MN] anything.  Even the war.  I'm just like ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And even scandals like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- this topic.
R:  I know.  Enron, I really kind of, you know, just, like, heard about it here and there because it was so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- big.  
L:  Yes.
R:  But I truthfully didn't follow it, you know.  I just, uh --
L:  Right
R:  -- you know, I -- but, I -- I mean I do have my opinion on corporate, um, you know, affairs and I -- that, you know, corporations, especially the monopolies that are out there, you know, have too much control.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um ...
L:  Like Microsoft and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- they have too much control --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- over what goes on and, you know, y- you throw in the advertising -- the paid advertising and the lobbying that they do with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- politics and it really pretty much controls human interest.
L:  Yeah.  And what's frustrating about it, you can't not buy anything Microsoft.  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My dad --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- used to -- like if he gets mad at a company, you know, like he was mad at Nike for a while.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know why.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And he tried not to buy anything Nike but h- he --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- plays tennis all the time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and mom would get him some wristbands or something that had a -- the Nike swoop and he was like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "I don't want that".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then he saw something he really liked --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that was Nike and he had to get it.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So it's, y- you know, it's -- it's not fair because, like, Microsoft, I can't -- if I were mad at Microsoft I can't, you know, with --
R:  Not do with it.
L:  -- the scandals, I can't not [LAUGH] get anything Microsoft.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  True.  I mean, if you have a computer you kinda need them.  
L:  Right.
R:  And I mean they have been taken to task about their monopolizing.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, but I still don't think it's hurt them.
L:  No.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't think anything could.  
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  [MN] [COUGH] 
R:  And, I mean, I don't know, like I've always kind of shunned the corporate worlds.  I'm just not --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- like a real business person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know it's like I worked for a not for profit for --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- twelve years.  The last twelve years.  
L:  That's what I would like to do if -- if I was working.  
R:  Yeah, it's funny though because once you get into the not for profit world [MN] um, you realize that it's kinda just like another corporation.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you feel like you're making a difference and you feel like you're helping people but when it comes down to it there's a lot of red tape and there's all -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people in command and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, there's all this bureaucracy that goes on [MN] within these not for profits as well.  
L:  Yeah.  My husband's ex --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- boss worked for, um, American Heart Association.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she said --
R:  Oh, that's -- 
L:  -- they have --
R:  -- particularly, I imagine, you know, like [MN] it -- it was probably run just like a big corporation.
L:  Yeah, that's what she said.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She said it was [MN] almost worse.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  But ...
R:  Um, so, yeah, when I left there I kind of felt, you know, like I -- I had had enough.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right. 
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, it's a hard topic to talk on.  
L:  It is.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It is.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, uh, especially when you don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- really ...  I -- I -- I just keep up with everything by --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, asking my husband or ...
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, my husband's a big fanatic with the news.
L:  Yeah, mine [LAUGH] too.  
R:  Yeah, he loves it.  He's the exact opposite of me.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he can talk on anything that's in the news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And has his ideas and opinions about it.  And me, I just stay oblivious.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So how many of these calls have you done?
L:  This is my third one.
R:  Yeah, mine's third also.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  So I think after three we get paid, or something, don't we?
R:  I don't know.  I mean --
L:  Someone told me that.
R:  -- I haven't do- -- uh, the first two I did a while ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I just haven't been available --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, 'cause they did call me a couple a times but I haven't been available. 
L:  Huh.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Well, the last person I talked to said after three you get, you know, fifteen or thirty dollars.  I can't remember what she said.
R:  Yeah, it's supposed to be ten per call.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  I did not even know that.  
R:  Yeah.  Oh, why, you thought you were doing it for free?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I g- -- [LAUGH] I didn't -- is there a place you log in?
R:  Yeah, well where -- you didn't, uh, sign --
L:  Is it N.D.P.?
R:  -- up?
L:  I -- I have no idea.  I don't even know how I got to the site really.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I was just surfing I think and -- and ended up there and signed up.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  Was it --
R:  But --
L:  -- N.D.P. online or something like that?
R:  I don't remember.
L:  Or ...  Oh.
R:  I don't -- I don't really have the information handy.  I don't remember what the name of the site was actually.
L:  Huh.
R:  But, uh --
L:  See, they'll use that for --
R:  If you look in your history folder ...
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  I can do that.
R:  Maybe --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it has the site.
L:  Huh.
R:  Um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- 'cause --
L:  See they'll use that for their survey, I bet.  [LAUGH]  Ha- -- like, how did you reach our site?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, 'cause I found out about it through [NOISE], I don't know, somebody on a -- on a message board.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, on ways to make money.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  Do -- are any of those good, like ...?
R:  What, ways to make money?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I've been doing, um, [LIPSMACK] mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, really?  I -- uh.  Are you signed up?  I'm signed up with B.A.I. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And do --
R:  I'm signed up with them too.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I keep getting postings and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're [MN] places --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right in my town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I never get them. 
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, really?
L:  And I can -- I can apply right after --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they send it to me and they -- they still don't.
R:  Huh.
L:  I don't know what the deal is but ...  [LAUGH]  I went on one.
R:  Oh, you did go on one?
L:  Yeah.  A --
R:  So --
L:  -- long, long time ago.  
R:  [NOISE]  Right.  
L:  And I turned it in and everything but --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  
L:  I don't -- I don't know.  
R:  I don't know.  Maybe --
L:  How many have you done?
R:  Lots.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  Yeah, I've been doing it since the baby was born.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Because it was like a way of supplementing, you know, my husband's income.
L:  Yes.  I need that.  My husband's not working right now.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, it's not really a big moneymaker.
