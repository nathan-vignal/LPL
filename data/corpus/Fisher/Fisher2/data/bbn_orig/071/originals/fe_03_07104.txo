R:  [NOISE]  Hi, how are you?  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, How are you?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay, thanks.  I'm Ann.  What's your name?
L:  Ah, [SIGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is John Fong from California.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in California.  Your name is Leo?
L:  [SIGH]  John Fong, yeah.
R:  Oh, John +Fong?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, what's your name?
R:  [SIGH]  Jo -- ah, Ann.
L:  Ann.  Okay.  Hello, Ann.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm in California.  Los Angeles, California.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  So, we're not far away form each +other, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.  So, ah, so the topic is, ah -- ah, corporate conduct in the US, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Correct.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so I -- I think that's a very important, ah, topic in today's economy.  [SIGH]  So, okay, tell me a little bit about your o- opinion on -- on this.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, well I don't really know what the government can do about it if --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anything at all.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you don't +think they are doing -- doing anything useful for now?  [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, I don't think they're doing anything useful.  They should do something useful.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.  So, even with all those, ah, [SIGH] high profile cases you don't think that's enough?  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  No, they should do something useful.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]  Maybe not have high profile cases.  Maybe [SIGH] some people it affects 'em wrong emotionally.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  Because I think, ah, -- ah, [SIGH] all the scandals, ah -- ah, have affected me, ah, indirectly [SIGH] because, ah, it contributes to the e- economic downturn and, ah, that affect me, ah, financially.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, -- so how about you?  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  Yeah, it affects me financially also.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, [SIGH] -- and, ah, -- [SIGH] and, ah, the employees in those companies are -- are the biggest +victims -- +victims, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because they -- they lost, ah, they have lost their jobs and, ah, all their maybe pensions or things like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]  So, -- so -- [SIGH] so do you think, ah, -- [SIGH] ah, the scandals themselves, ah, [SIGH] have caused the, ah -- the, ah, recession [SIGH] or the, ah, stock market down turn, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or the other way round?  [LAUGH]
R:  The scandal itself caused it, I think.  [SIGH]
L:  You think so?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Because maybe I think, ah, [SIGH] originally it's, [SIGH] ah, economic downturn that, ah, caused, ah, [SIGH] more and more i- investors to be -- be careful about, ah, [SIGH] things like accounting.  And then [SIGH] many scandals a- are +discovered, ah.  Of course those discovered scandals were, ah, -- [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, +expedite the +economic downturn.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's my +reasoning.  [SIGH]  So, -- but, ah, you think, ah, it's the scandals themselves that cause, the -- ah, [SIGH] the downturn, right?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  What did you say you thought about it?  [SIGH]
L:  Because I thought it, ah, it's just like this, ah, [SIGH] it's a economy downturn [SIGH] caused --
R:  Oh, the economic downturn, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Caused, ah, [SIGH] many scandals, ah, to be, ah, d- disclosed.  [SIGH]  Not that, ah, scandals themselves, ah, caused a downturn.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  That's -- that's my point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, y- -- [SIGH] so -- so you have a d- different opinion on that?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.  So, ah, ... in my opinion [SIGH] I think the government is doing some of the r- right things to curb the [NOISE] i- illegal, ah, business activities.  Ah, but as you said, maybe, i- i- i- i- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not enough, ah, it's just a start point and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, there are [SIGH] -- are more things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do to correct --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the -- the whole system, [SIGH] you know?
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  So, -- [SIGH] so, ah, what kind of a long ... term solution you can think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of, ah, [SIGH] about this issue?
R:  [NOISE]  Ah, long term solution for this issue?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, I can't think of any.  I don't know of any.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you just think, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- +currently --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the government is not, ah, doing enough?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  I guess I'm just a -- a comment person, you know?  Ah --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think, yeah.  [SIGH]  I think y- you're right, ah -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- t- t- the real solution is very hard to find.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  All those politicians are -- are just doing something [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- c- c- c- correct for them, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rather than something correct for -- for all the people, yeah?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  But basically, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it's a very cheeky, ah, problems there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wi- with little existing solutions then.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, ...
R:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  Trying to think of something else to say 'cause we're supposed to be talking for ten minutes.  I think we only talked for two minutes.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, I think it's more than two, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm quite confident of -- of that, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I -- I think it's also a world wide, ah, problem.  It's not only in US.  [SIGH]  Maybe it's just a -- a -- [SIGH] all the, a- a- ah, press freedom that, um, di m- makes, ah -- ah, more scandals, ah, to be, ah, disclosed.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Maybe [SIGH] the other countries in the world a- are worse i- in this, ah, respect.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think so, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay, so you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- okay.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, -- but I think [SIGH] so far [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there are no, ah, large scale --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- s- scandals, ah, [SIGH] disclosed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about, ah, companies in California, [NOISE] right?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean +headquartered in California?
R:  Yeah, they had -- they don't +disclose any of the -- the large company scandals.  No, they don't let the public know anything about it.  They don't know about it.  [SIGH]
L:  But, ah, t- the economy is still going very bad --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, ah, [SIGH] does that mean that, ah, scandals themselves, ah, [SIGH] are not the whole story --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for -- for the, ah, -- [SIGH] economy downturn?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Because I think, [SIGH] t- that factor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- supports my point, a- a- ah --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] to some extent, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, ... Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Be- because, ah, [SIGH] myself, ah, working, you know, very large corporation.  I -- I know that, ah, how powerful --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] such kind of companies can be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] so if there is no check and balance, ah, things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can go really bad, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  So, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hopefully the -- the government can do something [SIGH] to change the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the --
R:  [MN]  Fair enough.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- the -- the situation?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Ye- --
L:  But to -- so -- so do you think +ordinary people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can also [SIGH] ah, ... change the system --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in some way?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because, the crash here is, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is about the government.  I think it seems that the government, ah, [SIGH] is the only solution if there is a solution.  [SIGH]  So, ... but, ah, -- but it [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not easy for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ordinary, ah, people to [SIGH] -- [LAUGH] to solve such kind of problems, although [SIGH] they have the freedom to [SIGH] express their opinions but, ah, [SIGH] maybe nobody will listen to it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Um ...
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  What part of California are you in?  Los Angeles?
L:  Ah, no, I -- I -- I'm in, ah, [SIGH] I'm in North California --
R:  Oh, North California.
L:  Yeah.
R:  San Francisco?
L:  San Francisco, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, San Francisco, North California.
L:  Yeah, s- s- s- so t- that's the heart of silicone valley.  [SIGH]  There are many, ah, -- ah, corporations --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- although, ah, m- many are start ups, but, ah, [SIGH] I think many start ups are [SIGH] evolving into corporations very quickly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  San Francisco.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I think t- the --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- this kind of problems there will be more and more serious, ah, in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- silicone valley, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you are in, ah, +Los Angeles, ah?
R:  Yeah, I'm in Los Angeles, y- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  A- a- are there many, ah, big companies, [SIGH] ah, [SIGH] headquartered, ah, in Los Angeles?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, because I know that, ah, over ten years back, ah, [SIGH] the economy went very bad, ah, in Los Angeles --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] due to [SIGH] the defence industry, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, ah, the -- the -- the cold war was over and, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] the government, ah -- ah, didn't, ah, need, ah, more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- defence industry [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] i
L:  -- then the [SIGH] -- the economy in the whole area, ah, w- went down and, also, the -- [SIGH] the housing market.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah -- [SIGH] ah, I wasn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there -- I -- I just, ah, heard about it.  Do -- do you have any, ah, first hand experience of that downturn?  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  A- a- ah, [MN] what was the question again?
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Because I know that, ah, there was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- also, a -- a -- [SIGH] a very bad economy, ah, in Los Angeles +area over ten years back.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think around then, nineteen ninety [SIGH] due to [SIGH] the withdrawal of defence, ah, industry in that area.
R:  [PAUSE]
L:  H- have you got my question?  [SIGH]  So, -- so --
R:  Ah, no, I -- I didn't get it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Because, a -- [SIGH] a -- a [SIGH] I know that there is a --
