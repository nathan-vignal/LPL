L:  Hi, I'm Jackie.
R:  Hi, I'm Rebecca.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]  Um, outdoor activities is kind of a weird topic for me because I don't do many.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I'm a -- I'm really more of an indoor person but, um, there are a few things I like to do outdoors.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't like cold weather activities at all.  Um, I don't really like hot weather activities except for swimming, but when the weather's kind of moderate, like spring or fall weather, um, sometimes I like sitting -- just, you know, sitting outside and enjoying my surroundings, but I'm not really a very athletic person.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I think probably my favorite's actually cold weather.
R:  [MN]
L:  I really like the snow and I like, you know, skiing and snowboarding and stuff.  Um, in hot weather I think my same thing would probably be like swimming or maybe like water skiing, but I don't really like hot weather so much to begin with, so ...
R:  Yeah.  Um, you must be pretty athletic.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, not really. 
R:  Snowboarding's --
L:  I mean, I try to --
R:  Snowboarding's --
L:  -- try get out a lot but ...
R:  Mm.  Well, snowboarding sounds really strenuous.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's fun.  So ...
R:  Really?  I've never --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been skiing or water skiing or any of that.  So ...  Um, I'm not really -- I don't know, I'm just more of a kind of stay at home and as far as physical things go I -- I do more walking and playing with my toddler than anything [LAUGH] else.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, um, I don't know.  It's a hard question for me.  Um, I live in Oklahoma so we kinda get the crappiest of all worlds [LAUGH] as far as weather --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- goes.  The horrible heat in the summer and pretty bad cold in the winter sometimes.  Um, but fortunately we're lucky to have ano- -- uh, we're lucky enough to have four seasons here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know -- I know some places that don't.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I live in L.A. and it's pretty much the same weather all the time.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, that -- I've been to L.A. a few times and I wouldn't mind.  [LAUGH]  It's --
L:  Yeah, I know.  I kind of like, you know, um, stuff on the east coast where there's like a really definite season so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I like that better but ...
R:  Well, it's -- it's nice to have things changing 'cause whenever you get sick of things you know that something else is gonna be coming along before too long.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But on the other hand the times that I was out in L.A. the weather [LAUGH] was so nice I was thinking, I could handle this all the time.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I just -- you know, sometimes it's kind a -- it's like January, December and it's like eighty [LAUGH] degrees outside so ...  
R:  [MN]  I -- I can imagine that would be strange.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was out there Thanksgiving weekend a few years back.  I have a -- a boyfriend who moved to L.A. and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's why I've been out there.  And, uh, I spent Thanksgiving with him a few years [LAUGH] back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was very strange to be in L.A. for Thanksgiving and it was hot.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, not hot hot.  But, you know, it was definitely -- you had to wear shorts or you were uncomfortable.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And it was really weird because usually around here, um, in northern Oklahoma by -- by Thanksgiving you wore a coat everywhere.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, it doesn't usually snow -- sometimes it snows before then, not usually.  But, uh, we don't usually have snow at Thanksgiving but it was [LAUGH] definitely a contrast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I imagine it must be really strange celebrating Christmas --
L:  Yeah, you know it just --
R:  -- at the beach.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm used to it because that's, you know, how I've -- I've always lived here.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, yeah, I'd kind of like to have snow and all that kind of fun stuff.  But, yeah, I kind of go against it even though it's shorts weather I just -- I wear pants.  If it's winter, like no matter how hot it is.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...  I don't really like it that much but it's nice, like during summer and stuff, it's really nice weather.
R:  Well, I -- when I've been out there in the summer it was -- it was pretty warm but it wasn't like what it is here.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, the last -- the last four summers in a row, unfortunately, I was pregnant during the hottest one of all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [MN] we get -- I mean, w- we will sometimes go sixty days without having anything [MN] down in the double digits.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  It can get really bad.
L:  Geez.
R:  And, um, I don't know why because we're as far as we are from the Gulf of Mexico but we get terrible humidity here too.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I've been to Arizona in the summer and it's hotter.  But it doesn't feel [LAUGH] that way because the humidity's not so bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I [MN] -- a few places I definitely wouldn't want to live.  Houston and New Orleans.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  New Orleans is a beautiful city but I -- I never want to step foot down there in the summer again.
L:  Yeah, I've never been there but I remember being in Florida and it was really humid.  I think it was -- it -- like wintertime or something and it was so humid.  It's not --
R:  Really?
L:  -- humid here at all really, so it's nice.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Um, God it was perfect [LAUGH] everytime I've been to L.A.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was beckoning to me.  Move out here.  Move out there.  And then I broke up with my boyfriend and had no reason to move there.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh, well.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it w- it was just beautiful everytime I went out there.  Um, I'd be -- I don't know, I'm -- I'm a little freaked out by your, uh, earthquakes but [MN] you know, as often as the big ones happen I wouldn't worry about it all the time, I guess.  
L:  No.  Um, the last time, you know, there's a big one, I guess, was ninety five but, I mean, I was a little kid 'cause I'm sixteen but, um --
R:  You sound older than sixteen.
L:  -- [inaudible] had some for a long time.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What?
R:  You sound older?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  Thank you.  Yeah, but, um, yeah, I just -- I remember that one time and there've been a few kind of, like, aftershocks or tiny quakes and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's never been so bad.  I didn't even think of that.  When people say, you know, earthquakes, earthquakes.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  I -- I suppose when you're used to it it's no big deal.  Unless --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have a big one.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, um, every once in a while we hear that we had an earthquake but it would -- it would be such a tiny one that nobody could feel it.  They just picked it up on the seismograph.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, uh, that's kinda interesting.  The only time I ever felt anything that I thought was an earthquake here was when the Oklahoma City bombing happened.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You could -- we're about -- we're about fifty miles from there and we could actually feel the ground shake a little bit.  And I was in class.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, uh, it was freaky.  Everybody was kind of looking around going, "What's going on?" 
L:  Gee.
R:  And we didn't find out 'til that afternoon what had actually happened.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, yeah, we felt a little tremor [MN] from that far away and we thought it was an earthquake for a second. 
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, I certainly would not want to be in the middle of a big one.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I guess sometimes it will happen, like in the middle of the night.  I think when it's happened, like four in the morning, and it was just like a tiniest little shake.  And you know, the next door it was like, "Oh, did you feel the earthquake?"  And it's -- it's just kind of normal I guess.  It's not like [several inaudible words] big deal.  
R:  Yeah, I've had people say, "Oklahoma.  Oh, my God.  Tornadoes.  You have so many tornadoes".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we do.  We have 'em all the time in the spring but we're so used to 'em.  I guess it's kinda the same thing.
L:  Yeah.  Wow.
R:  Un- unless we have a big huge one it's no big deal to us.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Fortunately --
L:  Yeah, I've never been in a tornado or anything.
R:  Uh, I've never been in one.  We've had -- we've had some close calls where I live.  You know, we have a lot that go around the area but we've never actually been hit and I'm so glad.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's lucky.
R:  It's -- it's [MN] whenever there's -- whenever there's a good size one coming people get a little tense but, you know, they can be so unpredictable.  You know, a tornado hits your town and it can destroy the house down the street and leave yours untouched.  
L:  Wow.
R:  You know.  [LAUGH]  Really, uh, the -- the risk of actually being hit by one is so tiny.  
L:  Yeah.  They've always scared me.  I remember just like reading about stuff or seeing it on TV.  I was just really scared of that.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you -- if you're one of the ones that gets hit you're -- you're not very happy but -- but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the chances of being hit are not -- not that high.  But, uh, I remember watching the, I don't remember what year it was, maybe ninety three, that big earthquake in L.A. --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on television.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was just freaking.  I was -- oh, God that's -- that -- I -- I knew three or four people out there and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I thought [MN] are they alive or ...  It -- it was terrible.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, that was quite a while back.  I bet you probably don't remember that, do you?  Or at least not very well.
L:  Well, I was a little kid and I remember -- we used to live, um, in Hollywood.  [inaudible] Hills.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it wasn't so bad there.  I just remember all of us went down to the living room, but I couldn't remember too much of what happened.  But, I mean, it wasn't really damaging to our house.  But, then like you see on the news, like in North Ridge and stuff .
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was pretty devastating so ...
R:  I remember hearing about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wasn't it like really early in the morning too?
L:  Yeah.  I think it was.  
R:  That's what freaks me out.  Is when stuff like that happens like in the middle of the night or early in the morning.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  When people are asleep.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's -- that's really [MN] we've had a bad problem this year in Oklahoma with n- nighttime tornadoes.  
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  And nighttime tornadoes scare me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because the thought of -- you know, our tornado sirens aren't -- I mean, they'll get your attention if you're awake but I don't know if -- I don't know that they'd wake me up.
L:  Hm.
R:  And so it's a little bit scary.  When we're having severe weather late at night I tend to wait to go to bed until I know that nothing's gonna [LAUGH] happen.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  My husband says --
L:  And --
R:  -- I'm one of those people who could sleep through a truck driving through a nitro- nitroglycerine plant.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  So I -- I don't like to take chances.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I'm kind of a light sleeper but they'll be wind sometimes [MN] um, I mean, I'm sure they're not as [LAUGH] bad as tornadoes and stuff but they kind of shake the house.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So --
R:  Oh ...
L:  -- sometimes, you know, I think it's an earthquake but it just ends up being the wind and it gets pretty loud and, like, hard to sleep with that too, so ...
R:  What part of L.A. do you live in?
L:  Um, right now I live -- it's kind of near Santa Monica on the west side.
R:  Okay.  That's not all that far from where my boyfriend lives so I can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sort of get a -- he lives in El Segundo.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's not too terribly far.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So I -- yeah, I kind of know where you are.  I know the area a little bit.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  I kind of miss  it.
