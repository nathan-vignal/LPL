R:  Hi, um, I'm Sharon from Massachusetts.
L:  Hi, I'm Mike from New Jersey.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are ya?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Have you done this before?
L:  No, never. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, this is my second time.  It's really fun.
L:  Yeah?
R:  It's not bad.  Do you wanna go first?
L:  Uh, no, you can go first.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I can get the ...
R:  Topic of --
L:  -- hang of it, I guess, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, friends.  Um, I'm the kind of person who has friends -- a few friends, but I've had those friends since, um -- one of them, my -- one of my best friends I've had -- I've known since I was twelve.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, uh, the other one we met in high school and that was twenty years ago and we're still friends.  So, I'm the kind of person who has [SIGH] just a few friends, but I tend to hang on to them for a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's really kind of nice because, you know, we go way ba- back and I tend to be, like, if I go somewhere, like I've joined the P.T.O., the parent teacher organization, since my daughter's been in school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, you know, I'll make new friends and stuff, but it just isn't the same as those old buddies of mine that I've had forever.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I tend to be very close with my sisters, too.  I have two sisters and they live nearby and we're -- you know, we have similar interests and so, um, I'm close to them, too.  I -- I'm not like my brother.  My -- my brother has these, um, I don't know, he's just really gregarious and outgoing and a big talker and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he's the kind of person who, everywhere he goes, he instantly makes friends with people.  He stays in touch with all of 'em and he's -- he's very organized, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's kind of like one of those situations where you've gotta have a big address book or something to keep track of all those -- his new friends from wherever he goes, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  What about you?
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm the total opposite.  I have a whole lot of friends.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I have my -- the one or two that are, like, my best friends, but I'm really open to, like, be friends with anybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I'm, like, a very friendly person.  I like talking, I like, you know, I just like hanging out.  I like going out, and I mean, I've had those one or two friends that I've been friends with since -- since basically I was born, you know, and I'm also very good friends with my brother.  My brother's actually one of my best friends.
R:  Hm.
L:  And, uh, I don't know, that's about it, really.
R:  That's nice, though.  Isn't it nice to have a brother?
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- 'cause you know you always have somebody who really understands you and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's how it is with my sisters, too.  You don't ever have to, uh, worry about what they're going to think if you're gonna do something crazy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or, you know, or if you could -- decide you wanna do something different it's -- it's always okay so --
L:  They're always behind you.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It's so true.  Yeah, that's really nice.  So, are you single?
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] So, you tend to -- you have more time to hang out and stuff?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I work a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I like -- I like going out and stuff.  I like meeting new people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Where do you go?
L:  I go to bars and stuff.
R:  Hm.  Do you find that's a good way to meet people?  I mean, girls or, you know, whatever?
L:  What, going to bars?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not really.
R:  No?
L:  I don't like -- when I go to bars I don't try to meet girls to -- who -- who I wanna be in a relationship with because I know the type of girl that I wanna be in a relationship with is not gonna be a girl that's going to bars all the time, you know.
R:  Mhm.  Hm.
L:  So, I'm more looking for, like, the laid back type.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just like to go out with my friends and have a good time, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just hang out.
R:  That's cool, like sports bars and stuff?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's nice.
L:  What about you?
R:  Um, I don't go out. [LAUGH]
L:  No?
R:  It's terrible.  Um, my husband and I just -- we just had twin boys.
L:  Wow.
R:  They're a year old.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  Thank you.  Thank you.  So, uh, our social life is limited to -- I'm lucky if I get to go to the grocery store every week.
L:  Mm.
R:  And that's -- that I consider a -- the highlight of my social experience. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So right now I'm not really meeting too many new people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, that's all right because I'm just too tired actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, we -- we go out.  We -- this girl that I've known since high school, [SIGH] we get out once in a while with another friend --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- also from high school.  We'll -- we'll go out and, you know, see a movie or whatever, but that's probably two or three times a year. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, most of my stuff is just spent -- if I can get together with somebody to do errands or another mother, we'll get together -- you know, I have a seven year old daughter, too, so, uh, get together at, like, McDonald's or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the park or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so my friendships are mainly, um, related to childrearing at this point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like with the P.T.O.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Doing bake sales or going to brownie meetings and that kinda thing.  Sporting events, you know, like the kids' baseball games.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I haven't been to a bar in years.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My goodness.  I mean, I've been married for thirteen years.
L:  Wow.
R:  And before then we dated and that was never our thing anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's -- but it's hard to meet people.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  [MN]
L:  Definitely.
R:  Opposite sex or otherwise, I mean, it's just -- if you don't meet people at work or if you find a place you're comfortable with.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's tough.
L:  Definitely is.
R:  But, um, how did you find out about this study?
L:  Well, I was on a chat line actually.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause I like going on chat lines and just talking to different people from different places, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just to get a feel how everything is all over the country, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] And, uh, some guy just came on, he told me about it, so I called.  Sounded interesting, you know, so ...
R:  It is.
L:  Why not give it a try, right?
R:  Yeah, it's nice to get paid to be part of a study, too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I think that's fascinating, how they can figure out how, you know, our language evolves or -- or whatever they're listening for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How information is gathered when strangers talk.  It's so weird, though, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, it is, definitely.  'Cause you just talking to somebody that you never talked to before ever.
R:  No, no.  So, what part of New Jersey are you from?
L:  Uh, Burton County.
R:  Well, I don't know anything about --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't -- [LAUGH]
L:  Where are you from, Massachusetts you said?
R:  Chicopee[?], Massachusetts, which is, um, just outside of Springfield in Western Mass.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, we're -- we're probably -- we're an hour from the New York border.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  So ...
L:  I've never been -- never been there.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  No, I've been to New Jersey once, uh --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- to go to a --
L:  Where -- where in Jersey did you go?
R:  Uh, I don't even remember.  I think we just crossed through on our way to -- we were going to -- is it Lake George?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think we stayed at the Geor- -- what was it?  Um, George Washington Inn on Lake George or the White something or other, the White -- it was a big white hotel.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't even remember.  It was before my daughter was born, so that was seven years ago and that was with work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't travel much.  Although that's kind of off -- off topic.  I don't know how close to ten minutes we are.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It says, "Talk for eight minutes on the subject of friends".
L:  I do -- I do travel a lot.  That's another way I meet people, too.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I like going places.  I like going to Florida.  Florida's one of my favorite places.
R:  Oh, yeah?  And what part do you go to?
L:  Uh, Jacksonville.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Or Fort Lauderdale sometimes.
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  'Cause I have a lot of friends over there, too.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  A lot of friends have moved over there.
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, a lot of people have moved to Florida.
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's so nice.
R:  Ah.
L:  I mean, the only thing that -- that really stinks about Florida is there's no jobs.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Or there is jobs but they don't pay as well as they pay, like, up here, like up north.
R:  Oh, yeah, we're lucky here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as far as the pay scales go.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do you do?
L:  Well, me, I -- I work construction.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm also a deliveryman.
R:  Oh.  Oh, so you've got a lot of work here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, especially now.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I -- I only work a couple days in the construction, I mostly do delivery.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that --
L:  What about you?
R:  Oh, I'm home, I'm home with my children.  I've been home now [SIGH] for eight years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Since my daughter was born.  Seven and a half years.  I used to work at Monsanto, the chemical company.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They used to be here right in Western Mass.  They've since sold off that division to other companies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and moved out of the area.  But I used to be a lab technician so ... but I haven't done anything outside the home in that long so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Kind of stagnant as far as that goes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I still see some of those people once in a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Which is pretty nice.  'Cause there's people moved -- moved out of the state but they also stayed in the area, too, some of 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know --
L:  So, are you friends with, like, anybody in your neighborhood or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah, well --
L:  Like, where you live?
R:  Yeah, our neighbors are pretty nice.  They're mostly older people, retired people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but, um, there was a family down the street with a similar age daughter, we got to be friends with them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then there's some people up the street, our -- their kids go to the same school as -- as my -- my daughter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So we're friendly with them.  And 'cause they're all on the -- you know, they all do the sports at the same time, you know, it --
L:  Yeah, so you see 'em at the games and stuff.
R:  -- T ball, soccer and basketball.  Yeah, yeah.  Then there's people from church, but it's -- it's mostly casual acquaintances --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because everybody's in the same boat as us, um, time wise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it -- it's just the constraints on your time affect your friendships, too, I think.  Because nobody's got the luxury to just sit around any more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- if you've got a spare minute it's -- you better be getting your errands done or, you know, working on the yard or whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... [LIPSMACK] it's tough.
L:  Definitely.
R:  What about you, do you find that time is limited or ...?
L:  Well --
R:  I suppose being -- go ahead, I'm sorry.
L:  I -- I think it is 'cause I work a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I also find a lot of time to -- to, you know, relax and get out and do things for myself, you know, just to -- just to relax, 'cause I work a lot.
R:  Mhm.  That --
L:  But I -- I find time --
R:  Good.
L:  -- to relax myself and, you know, go out, meet people, you know.
R:  Mhm.  That's good.  You're smart.  Do it while you can.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, my niece lives in Florida.
