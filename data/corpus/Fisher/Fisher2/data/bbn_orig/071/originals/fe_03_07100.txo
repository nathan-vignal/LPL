L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The -- the FISHER call?
L:  Yes.  I didn't hear the phone beep though.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well it --
L:  Um, my -- my name is Marissa.  What's your name?
R:  My name is Alice.
L:  Hi Alice.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Good.  Tell me your name again?
L:  My name is Marissa. [NOISE]
R:  Spell it for me. [LAUGH] Just --
L:  M.A.R.I.S.S.A.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Marissa.  Can you hear me okay?
R:  There is some noise in the background.  It's a little bit difficult but --
L:  Yeah.  Well, then when --
R:  But not bad.
L:  Let me -- let me see if I can move around a little so --
R:  O- --
L:  -- it won't be so loud.  One moment.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] How are you doing today?
R:  Good.  Real good.
L:  Hold on one s- -- um, this is a -- I'm sorry.  I'm just -- um, I -- I live in New York.
R:  Oh.  G- -- I'm in --
L:  And I'm -- and I'm -- I'm out for happy hour right now at a bar so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, it's --
L:  Somehow --
R:  It's three o'clock in Oregon right now so happy hour hasn't started yet. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  You're from Oregon?  That's great.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful state.  Well, I --
L:  I've never been there actually.
R:  Oh.  I haven't been to New York either.
L:  Oh, you should come.
R:  N- --
L:  It's so nice here.
R:  That's funny how people on opposite sides of the country, you know, just -- you just never get that far.
L:  I know.  So, what're we exact- -- what exactly is the topic?  I c- -- I couldn't really hear it.
R:  I --
L:  I heard something about government regulating, um ...
R:  Illegal activities.  That's about all I could understand too.  That is not a very clear recording that they have.
L:  No.
R:  Um, but it was just -- I would assume, ah, [MN] what they're talking about -- i- illegal activities could be anything.  Um, I think one of the things right now they're talking -- or people are concerned about is, um, ah, like spam on the internet, that sort of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But boy, illegal activities could be drugs, ah, burglary [LAUGH] and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  P- pretty wide topic.
L:  Well, I think it's like I -- I think one of the problems that they're having right now is that people, they wanna, like, tap phones and they wanna be able to read the internet conversations --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're really -- they're really, you know, going on the borderline of what freedom is and what it -- what it means to be in this country and [NOISE] --
R:  That's true.
L:  I -- I don't really know how I feel about that.  You know, there are some things that I think that are meant to kept [NOISE] be -- kept private and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and no matter [NOISE] -- you know what?  I think once you start cutting into those [NOISE] -- those things, it's really, you know, jeopardizing our liberties.
R:  Ex- exactly.  What we're about.  Sure.  I agree with that.  Um, I know that there -- there are a lot of things that need to be done.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, you know, because there are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things that we would like not to have happen in the country.  But I don't know how the government's going to do it without causing a lot of problems --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to private people.
L:  Exactly.  Like, I think we're trying to -- [NOISE] we're trying to call ourselves a democratic society and trying to run so far away from, you know --
R:  M- -- sure.
L:  -- all the practices of these countries where, um, you know, the governments are run very differently than ours yet by taking away certain freedoms and liberties, we're, sort of, conforming to the rest of the world and going back to the thing that we, sort of, ran away from in the first place.
R:  I know.  And that's the worst thing that could happen.  We -- no- no- nobody would like to have that done.  You know, I, kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- see it in a -- well, just with the war we just -- we're still, sort of, having, um, the -- our government, sort of, is trying to -- well I d- -- I guess they're not trying to do it but, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Iraq perceives us as doing it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Kinda, taking over and telling --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- them how to run their country.  And, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we know ourselves we would hate to have somebody do that to us.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I'm sure that the government isn't trying to do that.  They're just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- trying to, ah, you know, s- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- help straighten their -- their country out.  So, there's -- there's, um, a whole lot of things to be said on both sides of that too.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, like, because they're able to [NOISE] intercept, you know, emails and -- and do all this stuff, they're able to prevent certain, like, terrorist --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever but I don't -- I don't think it's really fair to so- -- to, like, profile either.
R:  Oh, I don't either.
L:  Because it's, sorta, like [NOISE] -- it's s- -- and, like, I don't -- I don't understand what the difference is between, like, today and, like -- like, Nazi Germany where they, like, profiled, like, Jews and said that they were bad because they were Jews or people were bad because they were crippled, you know?  It's --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- sort of -- I mean, obviously, it's exaggerated.  I've -- s- society today is a little bit different but at the same time, I think that it's moving in that direction and [NOISE] any, you know, really exaggerated individual could lead the conversation in that direction, you know?
R:  Right.  Oh, I think so too.  Ah, something interesting that I just read in the Oregonian, which is our Portland paper, is that there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  is a -- a name --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's, ah -- there is definitely a profile on it.  It's a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The name is like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Peter, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Peter Jones, something like that.  And every single person with that particular name, is being --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stopped in the airport and double checked and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It -- his -- ah, we have a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, a golfer in Portland whose --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that is his name --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he has been stopped numerous times in the airport and it's obvious he's not a terrorist, you know?  He has his golf clubs and he has people traveling with him and [LIPSMACK] -- so, anyway, th- -- he -- they say he can't get his name off that list.  And there evidently is a list of several --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different names --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and if you have that name, you're just, absolutely, you know -- they just stop an- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- double search you.  And that I -- I'd never heard of that before.
L:  It's really scary.  It is, you know?  I mean, I think that there's certain things in this country that'll -- are illegal or certain practices that are just ridiculous.  There's the -- you know, our legal for certainly[?] -- like, I don't know if you know what -- the whole hype that's going on with, like, our mayor Bloomberg?  But he's, like --
R:  Oh, a little bit about your --
L:  He's [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.  They're -- you're -- they're -- you're being, ah, ticketed for, like, sitting on a park bench or things like that?
L:  Yeah.  Like, they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They, like, ticket us for everything.  Like, there was a pregnant woman that got a ticket for sitting down on the subway stairs and, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you're not al- -- you're not -- like, there are places in Central Park where you're allowed to let your dogs run free so they can all, like, play and now --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- if you're seen with your dogs off the collar, you get, like, a ticket.  Like, it's just taking away, like, liberties and, like, freedoms and, you know -- th- they're trying to improve the quality of life and at the same time they're -- they're taking the quality of life lower, you know?  And I --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- think it's -- it's very similar t- -- in the -- in the same sense that -- to the government trying to regulate -- you know?  It's, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- how much power can we give them especially when --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- like, most of the people in this country don't even vote. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  I know.  I know.  And so then, you know, we really can't complain if we don't vote --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, ah, we're going to anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, do you still have -- do you still --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have the people that, ah, wash your windshields on the street corners and ...?
L:  No.
R:  I read about that one time.
L:  Uh mm.
R:  Okay.  That was --
L:  Not at all.
R:  Did, ah, Giuliani stop that?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I don't even know.  Probably.
R:  I -- I seem to re- -- ah, that I read about that.  That was something that really, he didn't like to have being -- you -- being done.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, but -- yeah.
L:  It sh- -- I just feel, like, everything.  It's like the city is just really, like -- there's so many, like, wonderful things about it and everyone's just so nervous now and it's just really unfor- -- like, they took smoking away in -- in bars and restaurants.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which -- which I think -- I -- I totally agree.  I don't think it should be everywhere but, like [NOISE] -- like, it's causing people to, like, have fights on sidewalks --
R:  Ah, no.
L:  -- and, like -- and they're like -- y- you know?  They just -- they just didn't do a good job about it.  If they -- like, I think that they're just picking and choosing to, like, make laws and not realizing the implications and such and, you know, following through with all of them and, sort of, just moving on to the next thing 'cause they're so worried about taking care of everything, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  They should --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stay with one thing 'til they get it fixed.  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I, sort of, agree about smoking in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- restaurants but I would think that smoking in bars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is gonna be really hard to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, control.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Did you hear -- there was a guy that, [NOISE] um, was smoking in a -- in a bar -- actually, a couple of blocks from where I am right now and, um, the bouncer asked him to leave and the -- he said, "No" and the bouncer ends up, you know, taking him outside and he ended up stabbing the bouncer to death.
R:  [MN] Oh, no.
L:  And this poor bouncer was just, like, doing his job, ended --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- up getting killed [NOISE] because he's trying to enforce some law that n- -- like, no one believes in except [NOISE] for Bloomberg. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  Like, the whole point is, I think, they didn't even, like, [NOISE] take a vote [NOISE] about it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they're really [NOISE] -- I think a lot of these laws and a lot of these freedoms, they're being taken away whether it's, you know, phone -- phone taps and whatever.  They're just -- they're not asking the people if that's what they want and they're not informing them enough to tell them that there's enough reason to [NOISE] -- to do these things, you know?
R:  Well, sure.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If they say, "This is --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the law" but they don't tell you why or shall I give you --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some good reason for it --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- people are gonna think, "Well, who cares?"  You know?  They're just gonna --
L:  Like, the same thing th- -- how we went into Iraq and -- and tried to l- -- you know, how we took over their [NOISE] country.  And -- and I was -- I was for the war and I'm happy when -- and I'm [NOISE] glad Saddam Hussein's out of power but, at the same time, [NOISE] I still don't know why we did it and I don't [LAUGH] -- you know? [NOISE]
R:  I don't either.
L:  I really don't. [NOISE]
R:  I --
L:  I really don't.  And it's so sad.  And, like, [NOISE] maybe it was a hundred people that died.  Maybe it was, like, two hundred.  It doesn't really matter.  But those -- those sons and -- and their mothers or those daughters and their mothers, those [NOISE] mothers have no idea why [inaudible] children respected[?] the country, you know?
R:  Oh, absolutely.  No.
L:  So --
R:  Th- that was bad.  And now they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- having a terrible time just controlling everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because the Iraqi people don't want us there.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, they wanna go on with their lives and -- or, you know, even bad as it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they at least -- their religion is so different and I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, um -- that, um, George Bush --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being a -- a p- -- b- -- the Christian --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- religion, you know, he --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- couldn't possibly understand what they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- going through.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, you know, if you're not -- you know, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They have a lot of religions and I'm not familiar with them either but I do know that they're very different.  So, you have -- that's a lot to h- -- to take into consideration.  D- --
L:  I feel like this country is -- is falling [inaudible] really [LAUGH] upsetting.  You know?  Like, for so long, there -- there was no talk of phone taps or -- and of any of this, you know, reading things on the internet, like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's just so unfortunate, like, [NOISE] that we have to even be doing that.  Like, it should b- be a bigger statement.  You know what I mean?  Like, I -- I -- I'm -- do realize that every empire that's -- has existed in the history of this world has eventually fallen but ours could have such a positive influence if we --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- run it --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- the g- -- right way.
R:  Sure.
L:  E- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  But we can't do it by just going in and taking over and saying, "This is the way you're gonna do it" because --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know?  We --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They don't think that we do all that good ourselves and, ah, [LIPSMACK] so they're gon- --
