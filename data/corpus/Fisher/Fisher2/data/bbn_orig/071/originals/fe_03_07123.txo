L:  Oh, 'scuse me.
R:  What is it?
L:  [MN]
R:  Corporate conduct in the U.S.?
L:  We're getting paid for this, right?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Are we getting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- paid for this?
R:  Yeah, don't you -- yeah, didn't you call the, uh, one eight, uh, the eight +hundred, well, let's see.  Yeah.  I think so.
L:  Yeah, I thought so.  Okay, good.  
R:  I mean, we're --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- getting paid, [LAUGH] you know, yeah.  Of course we are.  That's why we're talking to one another.
L:  Right.
R:  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in New York.
R:  You're in New York.
L:  I'm in Syracuse.
R:  And I am in Seattle.
L:  Washington?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  
R:  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are you actually in the city or ...
L:  No, I'm --
R:  No.
L:  -- in Syracuse.
R:  Syracuse.  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  All right.  So, let's see, corporate conduct in the U. -- in the --
L:  You sound a little older than I am so I'll let you start.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, older, but I don't think I know more.  I don't [LAUGH] know ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Actually, I'm, um, yeah, I'm older but I'm on, uh, disability and, uh, section eight and a whole lot of things like that so, uh ...
L:  Oh, same here.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yes.  
R:  Well, I -- 
L:  That's why [LAUGH] I'm [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, [MN] look at that.  We have something in common.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Already. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, um --
L:  Okay.  About --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- business --
R:  Anyway, uh, the, um, the -- as far as I'm concerned, I mean, uh, [SIGH], you know as far as I'm concerned the stock market can just go back where it came from.  I don't like it.  And [LAUGH] I don't like the, um, [MN] the environment that it creates and, uh, I don't think that -- I think we need less government not more.  But --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- it's more or less helped me out, you know.  Although not because [MN] -- not because it wanted to.  
L:  Right.
R:  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- mostly [LAUGH] because I had -- I have a good counselor who helps me and who, um, helps me keep my head on, uh, when they tell me that I need to put four hu- four -- six hundred dollars for the spend down and then she makes the spend down, uh, go away by having a tear thing that, I don't know, whatever it's called.  I don't even know how it works.
L:  That's for Medicaid right?
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, no, Medicaid, Medicare.  
L:  Yes.
R:  Medicaid, Medicare.  So I get both.
L:  I know exactly what you're talking about because --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the same thing goe- -- uh, when I lived in Virginia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- same thing happens so ...
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So that's, yeah, and then --
L:  'Scuse me.  
R:  -- they get the spend down [MN] to work for you.  You know by --
L:  Right.
R:  -- reducing the -- they have a tear thing and they say, okay, you know, you come to see us every -- every week and that means so -- and for half a year that means that you've -- and whatever.  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN]  I don't know how it works.  All I know is that it does work.
L:  Right.
R:  And then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when it's -- when it stops working like for, uh, a month when they [SIGH] decide that, I don't know what.  But anyway this is not the subject.  [LAUGH]  I'm getting off the topic.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, well.  Tell me what you think about it?   [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, um, um, I was [MN] -- I was looking online and, uh, and I saw that, uh -- I don't have TV.  I mean --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I have -- we have just, uh, my little girl and I just have, you know, VCR tapes. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Anyway ...
R:  Okay.  
L:  So I don't get the news unless I'm online --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I see that Martha Stewart is indicted.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And, um, then they say -- then they said in the caption, what about Enron, Worldcom, such and such and such?  You know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, whoever is, um, has scammed the system, whoever.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And, um, and I like that.  You know, I mean, I like -- I like that notion, yeah.  Why -- why single out Martha Stewart?  How come they're not doing anything about these Enron boys?
R:  Because -- because they're one of them.  Because they're -- because [LAUGH] I mean [LAUGH] [MN] President Bush, you know, [MN] was, I think it was a -- a Houston, uh, or corporation.  I'm not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sure.  
L:  Right.
R:  And President Bush is from Texas.
L:  Right.
R:  Houston's in Texas.
L:  I see what you're saying, so ...
R:  Therefore --
L:  So you're thinking that it's a, um, they --
R:  Why would -- why would President Bush slap the hand what fed him billions of dollars in, you know ...?
L:  In monies?
R:  Money.  
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, he must a, you know, had -- I mean, you know, I mean, I don't know the fact that [MN] they are so -- the fact that [MN] President Bush is President is like ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you know, I mean, it -- it's no worse than, um, Clinton.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  No worse than --
L:  Oh, no doubt.  No doubt.
R:  No worse than --
L:  And then --
R:  -- Bill Clinton.  
L:  Then --
R:  But just different.  
L:  Then his wife comes out -- or the book comes out that his wife was really upset.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know about the whole thing.
R:  But she's gonna run for President.  The reason she's [LAUGH] but she's really upset but the main -- the main thing is not that she's really upset but that she probably will be running for President in --
L:  The next term.
R:  -- two thousand and eight.  Or two -- whenever the next time is.
L:  Right.  
R:  You know, so ...  Yeah, you know, but I don't think that [SIGH] I don't think that any of the big wigs really care one way or another as long as they get theirs.
L:  Right.  As long as they get paid.  They don't really care about the little guy.  
R:  Not at all.  And they do not --
L:  No.
R:  -- care about the medium guy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  They don't care about the, you know, none of it.  You know, none of it really matters except that they get theirs.
L:  Right.
R:  And even the [MN] the -- the head of Enron, he's still got his, um, everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's got his everything.  I think.  He didn't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- get -- he didn't get penalized.  
L:  Right.  And I -- I think that's pretty sad.  
R:  It is sad but that's the way it is, I think.  I don't think that it -- that [SIGH] you know, the way I deal with it is I just -- I try to be the best person I can.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I volunteer and I do things and I [MN] once in a while I can find a little job where I can get some money but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mostly it's just volunteer and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I help out and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it -- it makes my life better. 
L:  Right.
R:  Because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you gotta do something so ...  And as long as I'm feeling good about what I'm doing I don't really care what -- what is happening with big wigs.  They'll --
L:  Right.
R:  They'll -- eventually they'll go away.  I can only hope.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And if they don't, well, [MN] eventually I will.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  One or the other, you know.
L:  Right.  
R:  But, uh, yeah.  So what -- how old are you?  I'm just curious[?].
L:  I am thirty five.
R:  That's not too bad.  Yeah, I am, uh, [MN] from fifty five or fifty six.  It -- fifty six, yeah.  And my daughter is thirty one.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a little grandson.  He's ten and --
L:  +Oh.  
R:  Yeah.  He's ten, going on about six 'cause he's disabled so he's not ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But he's smart.  He is smart in his own way.  
L:  I believe you.
R:  He's just not smart in -- but he is learning also.  He's learning his -- he knows his -- his, uh, where he lives, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  He knows his address and his phone number now.  And, um, you know, all these things are things that he didn't know last year.
L:  Right.
R:  And so he is learning.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And, uh, so [MN] as long as he's learning and -- and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- moving forward that's good.
L:  Oh, that's the main thing.  That's the main thing.  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  Hm, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  But, um, uh, getting back to the topic just becau- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just, um -- 
R:  We should.
L:  I'm not trying to be funny.  
R:  No.
L:  I mean, just ...  Um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  No.
L:  Dow closes above nine thousand first time in ten months.  
R:  The Dow closed nine thousand?
L:  Above +nine -- nine thousand.  First time in ten months.  
R:  Huh.  Now is that -- that's a lot?  I -- I --
L:  I think so.  I think so.  Um, [MN] the industrial average.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, because wasn't it going down?  They [MN] they said to talk about the stock market and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and the big wigs and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So let me go to -- I'm looking at the paper.  Let me go to C one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And see what they say here.  And I like to look at the business page also because, um, because my daughter is directly affected by the decision
