[NOISE] MARION HELLO 'SCUSE ME SORRY ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_07116-A-0003)
[NOISE] SO I THINK THE DISCUSSION IS REGARDING THE SCANDALS IN THE STOCK MARKET  (fe_03_07116-A-0004)
YEAH I DIDN'T HEAR ALL THE QUESTIONS EITHER BUT I BELIEVE IT'S REGARDING THE CORPORATE SCANDALS THAT ARE GOING ON AND WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO TO PREVENT SOME OF THAT AND HOW HOW HOW WE'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY SOME OF THOSE SCANDALS AND IT'S KIND OF PERFECT TIMING WITH THE WHOLE MARTHA STEWART THING GOING ON  (fe_03_07116-A-0006)
RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_07116-A-0007)

UM UNLESS YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS IN THAT AREA  (fe_03_07116-A-0009)
MHM  (fe_03_07116-A-0010)
YEAH IT HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE ALL THE TIME AND AND YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK THAT AUDITING OR HAVING SOME KIND OF REGULAR AUDITS WOULD WORK BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE FIRMS THAT ARE DOING THE AUDITING THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE OFTEN  (fe_03_07116-A-0011)
UM [COUGH] 'SCUSE ME THAT HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW MIS- MISREPRESENTING THE INFORMATION  (fe_03_07116-A-0012)
SO AND I AND I'M NOT YOU KNOW I'D HATE TO HAVE ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY CREATED TO GO OUT AND AUDIT THESE FIRMS BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE A A WASTE OF MONEY AND YET  (fe_03_07116-A-0013)
AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T WANT TO SEE REPEATED INCIDENCES OF ENRON AND THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I THINK ULTIMATELY  (fe_03_07116-A-0014)
ULTIMATELY A LOT MORE PEOPLE THAN JUST THE EMPLOYEES OF ENRON OR MARTHA STEWART'S STOCKS GET AFFECTED I MEAN I THINK THAT IT AFFECTS THE WHOLE CONFIDENCE PEOPLE HAVE IN THE OVERALL  (fe_03_07116-A-0015)
UM STOCK MARKET AND I THINK WHEN YOU [MN]  (fe_03_07116-A-0016)
PEO- THAT IF WHEN THEIR CONFIDENCE IS AFFECTED THEN THEY ARE YOU KNOW IT IT DISCOURAGES THEM FROM DOING ANY FUTURE INVESTMENTS AND THEREBY AFFECTING YOU KNOW BEGINNING A WHOLE TREND OF UH HURTING THE ECONOMY  (fe_03_07116-A-0017)
YEAH EXACTLY  (fe_03_07116-A-0018)

SECRETS HAVE BEEN LET OUT THE AS A RESULT OF THEIR FINANCE IT'S GENERALLY LIKE SOMEONE FROM THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT THAT DECIDES TO FESS UP OR GETS UH BUSTED YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07116-A-0026)
SO I OFTEN THINK THAT MAYBE IF THEY DID MORE TO ENCOURAGE WHISTLE BLOWERS TO COME OUT AND LIKE MAYBE PAY THEM OR INCENT THEM OR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT GET PEOPLE INTERNALLY TO DO IT I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_07116-A-0027)

WELL I THINK MAYBE LIKE YOU SAID THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S [MN] MAKING A [MN] AN EXTERNAL AUDIT AND HAVING IT BE A THIRD PARTY AND SOMEONE WHO IS NOT INVOLVED YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07116-A-0031)
BECAUSE LIKE THESE ARTHUR ANDERSEN'S AND THESE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE DOING THOSE AUDITS THEY WERE BEING PAID BY THE COMPANY TO DO THE AUDIT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07116-A-0032)

I DON'T THINK IT'S AFFE- I MEAN I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST WAY IT'S AFFECTED ME PERSONALLY IS THAT I JUST JUST CONTINUOUS LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THESE INDIVIDUALS AND A LOT MORE SUSPICION YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07116-A-0045)
