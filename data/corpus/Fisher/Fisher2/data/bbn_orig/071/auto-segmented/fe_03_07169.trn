SO WHAT TYPE OF PERSON ARE YOU  (fe_03_07169-A-0003)
PERS-  (fe_03_07169-A-0004)
I MEAN THE [LAUGHTER] I I MEANT IN IN RELATIONSHIP TO TODAY'S QUESTION ARE YOU THE TYPE OF PERSON WITH ONLY A FEW FRIENDS OR DO YOU HAVE A WHOLE SCHMEER OF 'EM  (fe_03_07169-A-0005)
[NOISE] AH YOU HAVE SOME BUILT IN FRIENDS [LAUGHTER] [MN]  (fe_03_07169-A-0006)
OH LIKE YOURSELF I COME FROM A A LARGE FAMILY AS WELL AND I I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T MAKE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES  (fe_03_07169-A-0007)
I THINK ACQUAINTANCES ARE PEOPLE THAT THAT ARE PLEASANT COMPANY AND THEY'RE  (fe_03_07169-A-0008)
GREAT YOU KNOW FOR GOING TO PARTIES AND BUT I THINK A FRIEND IS SOMEBODY THAT YOU CAN ASK SOMETHING OF THAT'S A LITTLE ABOVE AND BEYOND AND THEY DON'T QUESTION IT THEY'LL JUST DO IT FOR YOU  (fe_03_07169-A-0009)
AND SO  (fe_03_07169-A-0010)
I I THINK I HAVE MORE FRIENDS THAN MOST PEOPLE DO BUT I THINK THAT'S DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE A VERY GREGARIOUS PERSONALITY  (fe_03_07169-A-0011)
I AND AH BUT I THINK I HAVE LIKE A BILLION ACQUAINTANCES BUT UH I WOULDN'T PUT THEM IN THE FRIEND CATEGORY SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T EVER TESTED THEM PER SE  (fe_03_07169-A-0012)
AND LIKE YOU SAY A TRUE FRIENDSHIP DOES TAKE TIME TO NURTURE  (fe_03_07169-A-0013)
WELL ACTUALLY I FIND THAT EMAIL IS A GREAT WAY  (fe_03_07169-A-0014)
AH ONE OF THE THINGS I DO IS EVERY WEEK I SEND OUT A LITTLE EMAIL JUST WHAT I DID DURING THE COURSE OF THE WEEK  (fe_03_07169-A-0015)
YOU KNOW HOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE SNIPPET STORY THAT YOU WANNA TALK TO YOU WANNA MENTION TO ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS BUT YOU KNOW YOU JUST DIDN'T GET AROUND TO TA- CALLING THEM THAT DAY  (fe_03_07169-A-0017)
SO EACH DAY I WRITE DOWN A LITTLE SOMETHING AND THEN AT THE END OF THE WEEK I MAIL IT OUT TO EVERYBODY SO MY FRIENDS FEEL VERY IN TOUCH WITH ME  (fe_03_07169-A-0018)
I OFTEN WONDER IF IF LIFE HAS BEEN TOO BUSY ALL THE WAY ALONG FOR PEOPLE  (fe_03_07169-A-0020)
AND I I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE I THINK THAT SOMETHING HAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO CHANGE THE WAY HOW PEOPLE RELATE TO O- EACH OTHER  (fe_03_07169-A-0021)
IF YOU'VE BROKEN DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHO DO YOU CALL YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07169-A-0022)
