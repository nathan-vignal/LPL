AS A SOME SORT OF CURE ALL  (fe_03_08685-A-0014)
AS SOME TEACHERS DO  (fe_03_08685-A-0015)
ONE BIG PROBLEM I KNOW QUITE A FEW TEACHERS A BIG HUGE PROBLEM IS THAT TEACHERS ARE PROBABLY  (fe_03_08685-A-0016)
THE THE THEY CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN THE LEAST COMPUTER SAVVY PEOPLE  (fe_03_08685-A-0017)

CAMPAIGN WEBSITE  (fe_03_08685-A-0034)
BUT YOU KNOW I A AS FAR AS THESE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF PUTTING OUT A PAMPHLET  (fe_03_08685-A-0035)
THAT'S HOW THEY SEE THEIR WEBSITES  (fe_03_08685-A-0036)
HOWARD DEAN PRETTY MUCH IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS USING THE INTERNET AND THAT'S NOT GONNA LAST LONG IT'S GOING PRETTY SOON EVERYONE IS GOING TO REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE  (fe_03_08685-A-0037)
COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET AND IF YOU KNOW THAT  (fe_03_08685-A-0038)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_08685-A-0039)
I WASN'T TRYING TO BE TOO CYNICAL BUT YOU DID HIT HIT ON THE HEAD UM THE POINT IS YES POOR PEOPLE WITHOUT COMPUTERS ARE PRETTY MUCH IGNORED AND UM  (fe_03_08685-A-0041)
YEAH YEAH I- I- IT DOES GO BACK THERE  (fe_03_08685-A-0042)
THAT THAT ER OF GOD I'VE SEEN THE STATISTICS  (fe_03_08685-A-0043)
UM CERTAIN SCHOOLS I I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS AND Y- Y- YOU KNOW ONE OF ONE OF THESE AFTER SCHOOL  (fe_03_08685-A-0044)
Y- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND I WILL GO IN AND AND TEACH YOU KNOW THEM  (fe_03_08685-A-0045)
AND I IT SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE NIGHT AND DAY YOU COME IN I I'LL ASK FOR ONE COMPUTER SO I CAN DEMONSTRATE THE STUFF ON  (fe_03_08685-A-0046)
AND THEY CAN'T EVEN SCROUNGE THAT UP I'LL GO TO ANOTHER SCHOOL AND I'LL ASK FOR ONE COMPUTER TO DEMONSTRATE ON  (fe_03_08685-A-0047)
AND THEY SAID WELL W- WE DON'T HAVE A DEMONSTRATION COMPUTER BECAUSE ALL THE KIDS HAVE THEIR OWN COMPUTERS THAT ARE NETWORKED IT'S LIKE OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH  (fe_03_08685-A-0048)
BUT WHAT A DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_08685-A-0049)
AND YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS ARE LIKE THREE MILES APART BUT THEY'RE THEY COULD BE WORLDS APART AS AS EDUCATION YOU KNOW COMPUTER EDUCATION GOES  (fe_03_08685-A-0050)
ONE UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT I'VE SEEN A LOT OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION BEING USED AS REWARDS  (fe_03_08685-A-0051)
YOU KNOW IF IF  (fe_03_08685-A-0052)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08685-A-0053)
AND AND AND IT'S SO ODD BECAUSE I WOULD GO IN I WOULD SET UP ER Y- YOU KNOW BEFORE THE KIDS ARRIVED I WOULD GO AND SET UP THE COMPUTER TO SO THAT I COULD TEACH WHATEVER CLASS WE'RE TEACHING  (fe_03_08685-A-0054)
THE KIDS WOULD COME IN THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY SIT DOWN AND PLAY MINDLESS GAMES  (fe_03_08685-A-0055)
AND I I I'D YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE KIDS IT'S NOT WHAT THE COMPUTERS ARE FOR WE'RE GOING TO LEARN STUFF YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK UP STUFF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND LEARN SOMETHING NEW WITH YOUR RESEARCH AND THEY SAID YEAH BUT YOU KNOW CLASS HASN'T STARTED YET SO WE'RE GONNA PLAY GAMES  (fe_03_08685-A-0056)
THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK OF THESE COMPUTERS AS WHICH IS  (fe_03_08685-A-0057)
AN AWFUL SHAME  (fe_03_08685-A-0058)
F- FOR FOR A LOT OF KIDS AND AND I'VE ACTUALLY HAD PARENTS  (fe_03_08685-A-0059)
DEFEND THEIR KIDS FOR THEM RESEARCH MEANS GOING TO THE INTERNET FINDING A WEBSITE AND PRINTING OUT THE PAGES  (fe_03_08685-A-0060)
AND THEN HANDING IT INTO ME THIS IS YOUR RESEARCH REPORT  (fe_03_08685-A-0061)
AND I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THIS IS NOT YOUR RESEARCH REPORT YOU HAVE TO PUT IT TOGETHER YOU HAVE TO SYNTHESIZE MANY DE- AND I'VE SEEN PARENTS ACTUALLY COME UP AND SAY YOU KNOW ALL THE OTHER TEACHERS ACCEPT THIS  (fe_03_08685-A-0062)
IT'S LIKE THIS IS NOT WHAT COMPUTERS IN CLASSROOMS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT  (fe_03_08685-A-0063)
AND I ALWAYS GAVE EXTRA POINTS FOR KIDS WHO ACTUALLY GOT STUFF OUT OF A BOOK  (fe_03_08685-A-0064)
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO START OUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE ONE THING ONE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW OR YOU HAVE A PRETTY YOU HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION  (fe_03_08685-A-0065)
BY RESEARCHING OVER THE INTERNET  (fe_03_08685-A-0066)
TRUE YEAH BUT  (fe_03_08685-A-0067)
RIGHT RIGHT BUT BUT ANY BOOK YOU KNOW JUST BY DEFINITION IT IT'S TWO YEARS OLD OR AT LEAST AT LEAST THE THE INFORMATION IN IT [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_08685-A-0068)
IS ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF MY COURSES WERE ABOUT A ASTRONOMY ASTROPHYSICS PLANETARY SCIENCE  (fe_03_08685-A-0069)
AND SO YOU KNOW HOW MANY MOONS DOES JUPITER HAVE YOU KNOW THAT CHANGES EVERY MONTH  (fe_03_08685-A-0070)
AND YOU KNOW THE MOST UP TO DATE ANSWER IS ON THE NASA WEBSITE NOT IN THE NASA BOOK  (fe_03_08685-A-0071)
SO IT'S GOOD FOR THAT BUT I ALWAYS MADE SURE TO TRY AND ASK QUESTIONS Y- YO- YOU KNOW BE BECAUSE THE INTERNET IS SO GOOD AT AT HAVING IMMEDIATE INFORMATION IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION  (fe_03_08685-A-0072)
I ALWAYS MADE IT A POINT TO TRY AND MAKE SURE  (fe_03_08685-A-0073)
THAT I ASKED BACKGROUND QUESTIONS THAT PROBABLY COULD NOT BE ANSWERED ON THE INTERNET AND ER SOM- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THEY WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THEY COULDN'T FIND IT AND I WOULD HAVE TO REMIND THEM THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF TREES DIED TO MAKE THESE BOOKS  (fe_03_08685-A-0074)
AND YOU COULD USE THE BOOKS AND IT'S NOT GONNA KILL YOU  (fe_03_08685-A-0075)
THERE YOU GO THERE'S AL- THAT'S THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE  (fe_03_08685-A-0076)
IT'S JUST I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_08685-A-0077)
IF THEY COULD  (fe_03_08685-A-0078)
I I I WISH THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T SEE COMPUTERS AS THE MAGIC SOLUTION BUT UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY OF THEM DO  (fe_03_08685-A-0079)
MHM  (fe_03_08685-A-0080)

SO I I KNOW THAT THAT COMPUTERS CAN BE A VERY GOOD THING IN IN EDUCATION BUT I HAVE ALSO NOTICED LIKE SOME CLASSES WHERE LIKE USING A COMPUTER DOESN'T REALLY HELP  (fe_03_08685-B-0008)
OH DEFINITELY [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08685-B-0010)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH MY DAD IS A TEACHER AND HE KN- HE KNOWS LIKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT COMPUTERS HE DOESN'T KNOW MASSIVE AMOUNTS BUT ALL THE OTHER TEACHERS HE [LAUGHTER] WORKS WITH KNOW SO LITTLE THAT HE ENDS UP HELPING THEM OUT AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO ANY BASIC THINGS  (fe_03_08685-B-0012)
WELL HE KNOWS LIKE A REASONABLE AMOUNT  (fe_03_08685-B-0013)
[NOISE] WELL YOU SEE I'M ACTUALLY DOUBLE MAJORING I'M ALSO MAJORING IN POLITICS BUT I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO  (fe_03_08685-B-0017)
HAVE A CAREER IN COMPUTERS  (fe_03_08685-B-0018)

[NOISE] BUT THERE'S SUCH A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE THERE'S  (fe_03_08685-B-0024)
THERE'S DEFINITELY A BIAS IN WHO HAS COMPUTERS AND WHO USES THE INTERNET  (fe_03_08685-B-0025)
'CAUSE THERE THERE'S THE THE UPPER  (fe_03_08685-B-0026)
MIDDLE CLASS AND MIDDLE CLASS  (fe_03_08685-B-0027)
PEOPLE WHO GENERALLY HAVE COMPUTERS AT HOME AND THEN THE THE POORER PEOPLE WHO ALREADY GET LIKE  (fe_03_08685-B-0028)
IGNORED A LOT LARGELY IN POLITICS ANYWAY WILL HAVE EVEN LESS ACCESS IF THE INTERNET BECOMES A MAJOR FORM  (fe_03_08685-B-0029)
[NOISE] AND TO TO BRING THAT BACK TO EDUCATION [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08685-B-0030)

OH YEAH TRUE LIKE I REMEMBER IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND WE WOULD HAVE WE HAD A COMPUTER IN MY FIFTH GRADE CLASS I  (fe_03_08685-B-0039)
WHEN WE WERE LIKE HAD DONE SOMETHING WELL AND WE HAD TIME AND STUFF THEN WE COULD GO AND PLAY GAMES ON THAT COMPUTER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08685-B-0040)
[NOISE] WELL THE OTHER THING THAT IRRITATES ME ABOUT KIDS USING COMPUTERS IS LIKE DOING RESEARCH FOR THINGS AND THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE INTERNET AND AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING IN A BOOK [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08685-B-0042)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08685-B-0045)

[NOISE] OF COURSE THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE WITH LIKE POOR SCHOOLS AND WHAT NOT THAT DON'T HAVE DECENT LIBRARIES [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08685-B-0052)
[NOISE] WELL IT'S JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN EDUCATION THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF VARIOUS TOOLS YOU CAN USE TO DO THINGS A- AND JUST PROVIDING THE TOOLS DOESN'T MAKE EDUCATION ANY BETTER  (fe_03_08685-B-0053)
LIKE EDUCATION IS STILL FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME AND THE TEACHER HAS TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND BE ABLE TO USE WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE TO THEM [NOISE] LIKE A GOOD TEACHER WITH  (fe_03_08685-B-0054)
