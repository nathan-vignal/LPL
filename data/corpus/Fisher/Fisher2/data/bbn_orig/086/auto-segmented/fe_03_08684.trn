BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LEARNING A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT EM THAT THAT WE [NOISE] DID WHEN WE WERE KIDS  (fe_03_08684-A-0008)
ER  (fe_03_08684-A-0009)

OR WHAT IF SOMEBODY DOES GET A BUG IN THERE AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM DOES CRASH THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOBODY'S GONNA KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO USED TO USING COMPUTERS  (fe_03_08684-A-0015)
WELL I'M I'M THIRTY FIVE AND I GRADUATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND WHAT I TOOK IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR WHICH WAS BASIC IT WAS JUST BASIC PROGRAMMING UM  (fe_03_08684-A-0016)

ER VIOLENT GAMES UM YOU KNOW AS AS A PLAY TOY SO IT IT'S I THINK IN IN SOME WAYS  (fe_03_08684-A-0020)
THAT'S AH AS A NEGATIVE THING BECAUSE WHERE THEY COULD BE SPENDING TIME DOING SOMETHING [NOISE] POSITIVE THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING BUT ER PLAYING  (fe_03_08684-A-0021)
NEGATIVE GAMES LIKE I SAID AH VIOLENT GAMES AND THINGS ON THE COMPUTER WHERE THEY COULD BE DOING SOMETHING MORE CONSTRUCTIVE  (fe_03_08684-A-0022)

EXACTLY EXACTLY AND THEN ALSO NOT LEARNING THE SAME RESPONSIBILITIES AS I LEARNED WHEN I WAS A KID YOU KNOW 'CAUSE YOU KNOW I USED TO GO OUT AND MOW THE LAWN TWICE A WEEK  (fe_03_08684-A-0024)
I GOT YOU KNOW A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SON NOW AND YOU KNOW HE SPENDS MORE MUCH MORE TIME DOING THAT AND THEN MY LAWN DOESN'T GET MOWED YOU KNOW AND THEN THEY'RE NOT LEARNING THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY I'M A ER SUPERVISOR AT THE HOME DEPOT  (fe_03_08684-A-0025)

WELL I ALSO I- I- IN MY POSITION AT WORK I DO USE THE COMPUTER AT WORK AND IT MAKES MY JOB A WHOLE LOT EASIER  (fe_03_08684-A-0036)
UM IF I HAD TO DO EVERYTHING IF I HAD TO PLACE ALL MY ORDERS BY HAND BY WRITING IT  (fe_03_08684-A-0037)
IT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING WHICH MAYBE THAT'S A NEGATIVE THING MAYBE I I SHOULD HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING I IT COULD BE A POSITIVE OR A NEGATIVE BECAUSE  (fe_03_08684-A-0038)
UM IF I HAD TO HANDWRITE ALL MY MY ORDERS THAT I I DO FOR SPECIAL ORDERS I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THEM ALL AS MANY AS I DO IN A DAY I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING SO THERE'S YOUR YOUR UNEMPLOYMENT GOES DOWN SO  (fe_03_08684-A-0039)

IT'S NOT STOPPING SO THERE THERE ARE POSITIVES AND THERE ARE NEGATIVES  (fe_03_08684-A-0051)
I THINK THAT A LOT OF THEM ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_08684-A-0052)
I DON'T KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THOUGH BECAUSE I KNOW ER IN OUR OWN DEPOT  (fe_03_08684-A-0053)
ALMOST EVERYBODY USES THE COMPUTER BUT W- NOBODY'S REQUIRED TO HAVE ANY COMPUTER EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU GET IN THERE  (fe_03_08684-A-0054)
