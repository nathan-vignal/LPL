WE WALKED IN THERE LIKE STORM TROOPERS  (fe_03_08629-A-0010)
BECAUSE PRESIDENT BUSH IS CLAIMING THAT THE C. I. A. IS TELLING HIM THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL THIS MASS DESTRUCTION WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_08629-A-0011)
AND THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BUY NUCLEAR YOU KNOW STUFF WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE COMPLETE AN UTTER LIES BUT WE WALKED IN THERE LIKE GANGBUSTERS  (fe_03_08629-A-0012)

YOU KNOW AND THAT'S ALL IT WAS WAS A TOKEN WE WERE OUT THERE ON OUR OWN  (fe_03_08629-A-0020)
YEAH WELL SEE THE THING IS THE THING THE THING THAT GETS ME ABOUT THE QUESTION IS THEY SAY IS THERE A COUNTRY THAT'S A THREAT  (fe_03_08629-A-0021)
EXACTLY YOU KNOW YOU  (fe_03_08629-A-0022)
EXACTLY EXACTLY AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A COUNTRY THAT'S A THREAT NOW DO I THINK THAT WE HAVE THREATS TO OUR SAFETY YES  (fe_03_08629-A-0023)

WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS  (fe_03_08629-A-0029)
BUT I THINK THAT THEY'RE MORE A THREAT  (fe_03_08629-A-0030)
TO THEIR SURROUNDING NEIGHBORS THAT THEY HAVE REGIONAL AND AND ETHNIC CONFLICTS WITH  (fe_03_08629-A-0031)
THAN TO US  (fe_03_08629-A-0032)
EXACTLY BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND EVERY RELIGION IN THE WORLD HERE IN OUR COUNTRY  (fe_03_08629-A-0033)
YOU KNOW BUT IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_08629-A-0034)
AND BUT IT'S LIKE UM  (fe_03_08629-A-0035)
INDIA AND PAKISTAN AND I USE THAT BECAUSE MY HUSBAND'S FROM INDIA  (fe_03_08629-A-0036)
OKAY  (fe_03_08629-A-0037)
THEY ARE BOTH NUCLEAR POWERS  (fe_03_08629-A-0038)
BUT THEY'RE ONLY A THREAT TO EACH OTHER  (fe_03_08629-A-0039)
AND THE THING OF IT IS  (fe_03_08629-A-0040)
WE ARE SUCH  (fe_03_08629-A-0041)
AN OVER ARMED BULLY  (fe_03_08629-A-0042)
THAT NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND IT'S GONNA TAKE SOMEBODY LIKE BIN LADEN  (fe_03_08629-A-0043)
TO TO ATTACK US BECAUSE NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WANTS TO INCUR THE WRATH OF THE WORLD'S ONLY SUPER POWER  (fe_03_08629-A-0044)
WELL SEE THE THING OF IT IS WHAT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT WE DID IN IRAQ ESPECIALLY THIS LAST TIME  (fe_03_08629-A-0045)
THE THE THE FIRST TIME BOTHERED ME BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THIS BIG  (fe_03_08629-A-0046)
UH DEMOCRATIC PROPONENT YOU KNOW DEMOCRACY IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT AND WE'LL HELP ANYBODY BE A DEMOCRACY WELL WHAT DID WE DO WHEN IRAQ INVADED KUWAIT WE GO OVER THERE WE KICK 'EM OUT AND WE GIVE IT BACK TO A KING  (fe_03_08629-A-0047)

OKAY  (fe_03_08629-A-0050)
AND THAT IS ALL IN THE WORLD NO I TELL YA WHAT THAT'S NOT IN MY OPINION THERE'S TWO REASONS THAT WE WENT INTO IRAQ THIS TIME  (fe_03_08629-A-0051)
WE WENT INTO IRAQ THIS TIME BECAUSE OF NUMBER ONE OIL AND NUMBER TWO IT WAS A PERSONAL VENDETTA BY THE SECOND BUSH BECAUSE SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD THE AUDACITY  (fe_03_08629-A-0052)
TO TRY AND HAVE HIS DAD ASSASSINATED  (fe_03_08629-A-0053)
AND HE WAS LIKE I'M THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL MAN NOW WE'LL SHOW YOU  (fe_03_08629-A-0054)
I MEAN THAT'S JUST THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT IT  (fe_03_08629-A-0055)
AND AND UH RIGHT NOW IRAN AND NORTH KOREA  (fe_03_08629-A-0056)
ARE LITERALLY SHAKING IN THEIR BOOTS  (fe_03_08629-A-0057)
THEY ARE SCARED TO DEATH THAT THEY'RE NEXT  (fe_03_08629-A-0058)
BECAUSE BUSH PUT THEM ON THAT AXIS OR UH AXIS OF EVIL OR TRIANGLE OF EVIL WHATEVER HE CALLED IT THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH THAT THEY'RE NEXT  (fe_03_08629-A-0059)
AND WHEN IT COMES AND AND I'M JUST I'M I I GUESS MAYBE  (fe_03_08629-A-0060)
[SIGH] I DON'T KNOW MAYBE I JUST LOOK AT AT THE WORLD THE WRONG WAY BUT I REALLY BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH OUR PEOPLE AND OUR SAFETY  (fe_03_08629-A-0061)
THAN GOING IN YOU KNOW AND CHANGING THE GOVERNMENT AND COUNTRIES THAT WE DISAGREE WITH WHICH IS THE REPUTATION THAT WE'RE GETTING NOW  (fe_03_08629-A-0062)
YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T LIKE SADDAM THE THE SADDAM HUSSEIN RE- REGIME WE WENT IN AND KICKED HIM OUT  (fe_03_08629-A-0063)
OKAY WE DON'T IT'S I MEAN IT'S WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE DON'T LIKE COMMUNISM  (fe_03_08629-A-0064)
SO NO WONDER NORTH KOREA'S QUAKING  (fe_03_08629-A-0065)

OKAY BECAUSE  (fe_03_08629-A-0068)
THERE'S THERE'S NOT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH  (fe_03_08629-A-0069)
NO ONE COUNTRY'S GONNA DO IT  (fe_03_08629-A-0070)
NO ONE COUNTRY'S GONNA STOP US FROM DOING ANYTHING WE WANNA DO  (fe_03_08629-A-0071)
AND THE THAT  (fe_03_08629-A-0072)
THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE OPPOSED TO WHAT WE'RE DOING  (fe_03_08629-A-0073)
COME TOGETHER  (fe_03_08629-A-0075)
TO STOP US  (fe_03_08629-A-0076)
BECAUSE OF ETHNIC CONFLICTS OR RELIGIOUS DISAGREEMENTS OR YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08629-A-0077)
CULTURAL DIFFERENCES WHATEVER THEIR PROBLEMS ARE THEY JUST WON'T COME TOGETHER TO STOP US  (fe_03_08629-A-0078)
SO I MEAN IT'S IT'S PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW U. S. HAS A FREE REIN TO DO WHATEVER WE THINK WE'RE BIG ENOUGH TO BULLY  (fe_03_08629-A-0079)
YOU KNOW OUR WAY INTO DOING  (fe_03_08629-A-0080)
