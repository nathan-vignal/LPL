I I DON'T THINK THAT THE NATION IS DOING THAT GREAT OF A JOB THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS PRIVATIZED AND I I REALLY JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY TO GO  (fe_03_08602-A-0012)

AH I DON'T I THINK THAT THEY'RE THE BE- I DON'T I THINK THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU GET  (fe_03_08602-B-0010)
TO WORK WHETHER IT'S GOVERNMENT QUALIFIED PEOPLE OR PRIVATE PEOPLE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE PAID SO LITTLE MONEY  (fe_03_08602-B-0011)

THEY ACTUALLY OPEN YOUR LUGGAGE AND AND SCAN IT WITH SOME KIND OF A HAND HELD THING AT CURBSIDE  (fe_03_08602-B-0021)
I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT'S NOT INSTALLED EVERYWHERE 'CAUSE TO ME THE MORE SECURITY THE BETTER I'LL GET TO THE AIRPORT EARLY  (fe_03_08602-B-0022)
AND I'LL WAIT IN LINE AND READ A BOOK I'LL DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO UM  (fe_03_08602-B-0023)

UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT EXACTLY FAMILIAR WITH THIS THIS IS SO NEW TO OUR COUNTRY EVEN I MEAN IT'S TWO YEARS BUT STILL IT'S NOT  (fe_03_08602-B-0035)
YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH LIKE ISRAEL'S BEEN DEALING WITH IT FOR FOREVER  (fe_03_08602-B-0036)
SO FOR US IT'S MUCH HARDER THAN LET'S SAY A COUNTRY THAT'S USED TO TERRORISM  (fe_03_08602-B-0037)

SOMEBODY'S DOING SOMETHING RIGHT WHETHER IT'S INTERCEPTING  (fe_03_08602-B-0051)
