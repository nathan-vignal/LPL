[SIGH] GOOD HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_08637-A-0002)
AH NO TERMINATOR THREE I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ONE YET NO  (fe_03_08637-A-0005)
[MN] WELL I THINK P- PART OF THE FAC- I THINK AS FAR AS THE ORIGINAL QUESTION GOES [SIGH] MY ANSWER IS OBVIOUSLY OTHER COUNTRIES ARE A THREAT TO US UM WE WOULDN'T HAVE A A MILITARY OR A NEED FOR A MILITARY IF THEY WEREN'T [SIGH] UM  (fe_03_08637-A-0007)
THE QUESTION  (fe_03_08637-A-0008)
THE THE BIGGEST THING TO THINK IS I THINK [SIGH] WHO THE EN- ENEMY IS ISN'T ALWAYS WHO WE LOOK AT AS THE ENEMY THERE'S A LOT OF SMALL COUNTRIES OUT THERE THINGS BLOW UP EVERY DAY [SIGH] UM  (fe_03_08637-A-0009)
SOMETIMES THE PROBLEM IS THAT I THINK WE IGNORE PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH [SIGH] AND THEY END UP BEING A BIGGER THREAT IN THE END BECAUSE THEY KIND OF GET IN SIDEWAYS [SIGH] UM I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT  (fe_03_08637-A-0010)
AS THE UNITED STATES WERE AN EASY TARGET [SIGH] FOR OTHER COUNTRIES 'CAUSE THEY LOOK AT THINGS AND YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES IS IN THE NEWS [SIGH] AS FAR AS POP CULTURE GOES OR [SIGH] YOU KNOW THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE EVERYTHING ABOUT AMERICA'S BLASTED IN FRONT OF PEOPLE'S FACES ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_08637-A-0011)
[SIGH] SO I THINK WHEN THINGS AREN'T GOING SO WELL IN A THIRD WORLD NATION OR WHATEVER THEY CAN LOOK AT THE UNITED STATES AS THE BIG MONSTER  (fe_03_08637-A-0012)
[SIGH] WELL WE'VE ALSO YEAH WE'VE WE HAVE GOTTEN OURSELF TO THE POINT WHERE THE UNITED STATES IS SEEN AS THE PROTECTOR OF THE WORLD AND ANY TIME ANYBODY HAS A LITTLE COMPLAINT [SIGH] WE'RE THE PLAYGROUND BULLY THAT GOES OUT THERE AND TRIES TO SE- SETTLE THINGS FOR 'EM  (fe_03_08637-A-0014)
[SIGH] ANY TIME THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AT THE THE CURRENT POINT WE'RE IN SOMETHING LIKE ELEVEN OR TWELVE OTHER COUNTRIES [SIGH]  (fe_03_08637-A-0015)
AND GRANTED WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO GO THERE AND WE'RE SOLVING THE PROBLEMS THERE [SIGH] BUT THAT'S A LOT OF PLACES TO S- SPREAD YOURSELF THROUGH AND I THINK SOMETIMES JUST LIKE YOU NEED TO LET KIDS GROW UP AND SOLVE THINGS ON TH- THEIR OWN [SIGH] YOU NEED TO LET OTHER COUNTRIES AT SOME POINT HANDLE THEIR OWN CONFLICTS AND RESOLVE THEIR OWN ISSUES [SIGH]  (fe_03_08637-A-0016)
UM [SIGH] YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE GOTTEN INVOLVED IN [SIGH] YOU KNOW W- [SIGH] [NOISE] THE THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE MAIN THREAT O- ORIGINALLY WASN'T NECESSARILY AGAINST US  (fe_03_08637-A-0017)
[SIGH] UM [MN] AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S AN ADMIRABLE THING TO WANT TO SOLVE OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS YOU KNOW [NOISE] WORK OUT TO TH- T- TO OUR BEST ADVANTAGE  (fe_03_08637-A-0018)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08637-A-0019)
RIGHT I ALSO TEND TO HAVE A CONSERVATIVE VIEW ON THINGS I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH IT OR TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING [SIGH] YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF IT AND SPEND LESS TIME TRYING TO P- PLACATE EVERYBODY THAT'S OUT THERE [SIGH] IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CONFLICT IT'S GOING TO BE A HORRIBLE THING IN THE FIRST PLACE  (fe_03_08637-A-0020)
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IS WHEN THE FIRST GULF WAR HAPPENED INSTEAD OF KNOCKING SOMEONE BACK [SIGH] AND TAKING A STEP BACK AND SAYING OKAY WE'RE GOING TO HOPE THAT THIS SOLVES IT [SIGH] YOU NEED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ALL THE WAY AND WORRY A LITTLE LESS ABOUT THE PUBLIC OPINION POLLS  (fe_03_08637-A-0021)
[SIGH] BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU END UP TEN YEARS LATER WITH A SITUATION THAT'S GOTTEN EVEN WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL ONE WAS [SIGH] WHERE YOU ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET MORE POWERFUL  (fe_03_08637-A-0022)
AND MORE ISSUES END UP DEVELOPING I THINK ONCE YOU MAKE A DECISION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO STEP IN YOU NEED TO STEP ALL THE WAY IN  (fe_03_08637-A-0023)
[SIGH] I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN OURSELVES WITH BOSNIA THAT'S WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN OURSELVES WITH CROATIA [SIGH] IS THAT WE'RE IN THESE COUNTRIES WE WENT IN FOR A GOOD REASON IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT WE HAD NO EXIT STRATEGIES [SIGH]  (fe_03_08637-A-0024)

THAT'S EXACTLY TO HEAR A COUNTRY DOESN'T HAVE NUCLEAR POWER THAT SOUNDS REAL GOOD BUT DO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE IT [SIGH] YOU KNOW IT'S A HIGH TECH WORLD YOU CAN GET ANYTHING FOR SALE ONCE RUSSIA BROKE UP [SIGH]  (fe_03_08637-A-0033)

THAT HA- THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR I MEAN YOU HAVE THE [SIGH] BUT YOU KNOW HON- THE HONEST HONEST TRUTH IS IS I WORRY LESS ABOUT PLACES LIKE CHINA OR RUSSIA ITSELF [SIGH] THAN I DO ABOUT LITTLE STATES LIKE CROATIA OR PLACES LIKE LIBERIA EITHER THE SMALL PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE THE MONEY  (fe_03_08637-A-0038)
EXAC- THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE  (fe_03_08637-A-0039)
