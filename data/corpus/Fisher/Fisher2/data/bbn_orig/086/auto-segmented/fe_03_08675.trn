RIGHT RIGHT YES I IT WAS  (fe_03_08675-A-0051)
YEAH  (fe_03_08675-A-0052)
I KNOW THAT'S WHY I THINK  (fe_03_08675-A-0053)
OUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS KINDA MESSED UP AND I'M NOT VERY YOU KNOW PATRIOTIC OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-A-0054)

SO HOW MANY DID YOU SAY THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGES OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY  (fe_03_08675-A-0057)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_08675-A-0058)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-A-0060)
YEAH I MEAN YOU HAVE SUCH A GREAT BREADTH OF CULTURE  (fe_03_08675-A-0062)
THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE  (fe_03_08675-A-0064)
TEN MINUTES IS A LONG TIME [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-A-0066)
[LAUGHTER] WHAT IF WE DON'T  (fe_03_08675-A-0067)
HI  (fe_03_08675-B-0002)
THIS IS BURTON  (fe_03_08675-B-0003)
OKAY  (fe_03_08675-B-0006)
AND THE QUESTION WHAT THE QUESTION AGAIN ABOUT WHICH CURRENT WHICH COUNTRIES ARE A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_08675-B-0007)
I THINK THAT SYRIA AND IRAN ARE PROBABLY HOLDING A PRETTY SERIOUS THREAT NOT TO MENTION NORTH KOREA  (fe_03_08675-B-0009)
COULD BE MAYBE NOT THE COUNTRY SO MUCH BUT THE UH THE FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEM TO BE RUNNING THINGS IS A LITTLE FRIGHTENING TO ME  (fe_03_08675-B-0010)
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE JOHN ASHCROFT CROWD BUT  (fe_03_08675-B-0011)
ANYWAY THAT'S A DIFFERENT KINDA DANGER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-B-0012)
BUT I THINK NORTH KOREA AS FAR AS  (fe_03_08675-B-0014)
UH SOME KIND OF CONFLICT WELL LIKE OBVIOUSLY LIBERIA BUT THAT THEY'RE NOT A REAL THREAT TO US BUT I THINK NORTH KOREA'S PROBABLY THE MOST SERIOUS THREAT WE HAVE IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_08675-B-0015)
AS FAR AS NUCLEAR WEAPONS  (fe_03_08675-B-0016)
UM THEY HAVE A MAJOR WELL  (fe_03_08675-B-0017)
THEY FINALLY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAVE A NUCLEAR PROGRAM BUILDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHEN THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BY AGREEMENT  (fe_03_08675-B-0018)
AND THEN THEY SAID THEY WERE WORKING ON ONE AND NOW THEY'VE ADMITTED THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR QUITE A WHILE AND OUR COUNTRY DOESN'T WANT THEM TO DO IT OF COURSE  (fe_03_08675-B-0019)
AND BECAUSE OUR HISTORY AND SOUTH KOREA UM SUPPORTING THE SOUTHERN KOREANS AND IN THE REGION  (fe_03_08675-B-0020)
WE'RE REALLY NOT FOND OF THEM HAVING ALL THIS WEAPONRY BUT THEY DO HAVE A MILLION MAN ARMY SO IT'S KINDA FRIGHTENING TO US BECAUSE THEY COULD JUST IT'S A BIG BIG OPPONENT SO  (fe_03_08675-B-0021)
AT THIS POINT NOTHING'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T WANNA PUT UP SUCH A BIG FUSS OVER IT FOR OUT OF FEAR I GUESS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN  (fe_03_08675-B-0022)
LITTLE COUNTRY BUT BIG WEAPONS  (fe_03_08675-B-0024)
IT ONLY TAKES ONE NUCLEAR BOMB TO RUIN A WHOLE CITY'S DAY  (fe_03_08675-B-0025)
WHICH IS ANOTHER SCARY THING BUT  (fe_03_08675-B-0027)
OH WELL WE'VE ALREADY SAID WE COULD DO THAT  (fe_03_08675-B-0028)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-B-0029)
OKAY SO I'M READY FOR YOU TO EXPAND ON HOW THE UNITED STATES IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO ITSELF  (fe_03_08675-B-0030)
MM  (fe_03_08675-B-0031)
SOMEWHAT OVER EXTEND OURSELVES AND WE HAVE QUITE A HISTORY OF THAT IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD PARTICULARLY THE MIDDLE EAST  (fe_03_08675-B-0033)
AND ASIA WELL BASICALLY EVERYWHERE WE'VE DONE THAT [LAUGHTER] HARD TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS  (fe_03_08675-B-0034)
WELL AND NOW  (fe_03_08675-B-0035)
THAT'S VERY TRUE BECAUSE IF YOU TRAVEL TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND YOU HEAR HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE A- AMERICANS IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT HOW WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES VERY MUCH SO  (fe_03_08675-B-0036)
YEAH PEOPLE THINK THAT WE'RE VERY BOSSY AND PUSHY IN TRYING TO GET OUR LIFESTYLE ON EVERYONE ELSE  (fe_03_08675-B-0037)
BUT IN REALITY I JUST WANNA BE ABLE TO GO IN AND OUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WITHOUT WORRYING THAT I'M GONNA BE BLOWN UP BY SOME KIND OF EXPLOSION  (fe_03_08675-B-0038)
BUT THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-B-0039)
I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT YES THERE ARE TERRORIST THREATS BUT JUST NOT REALLY A COUNTRY MAKING A TERRORIST THREAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08675-B-0040)
LIKE AN ORGANIZED COUNTRY IT'S  (fe_03_08675-B-0041)
MORE LIKE INDIVIDUALS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF 'EM BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT ANYWHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY GO ATTACK WHICH IS A BIG BEEN THE PROBLEM FROM THE START OF THIS WHOLE THING IF THERE WAS AN IDENTIFIABLE ENEMY WE'D HAVE CREAMED THEM A LONG TIME AGO  (fe_03_08675-B-0042)
BUT THEY'RE HIDING  (fe_03_08675-B-0043)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-B-0044)
UM  (fe_03_08675-B-0045)
WELL I GUESS  (fe_03_08675-B-0046)
I DON'T THINK THAT IRAQ DOES ANYMORE  (fe_03_08675-B-0048)
BUT I'D LIKE IT'D BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHERE THEY THEY EVER FIND THIS SADDAM HUSSEIN GUY  (fe_03_08675-B-0049)
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHERE HE'S HIDING PROBABLY IN SYRIA  (fe_03_08675-B-0050)
NO THEY HAVEN'T FOUND HIM YET  (fe_03_08675-B-0051)
SO THEY DON'T KNOW I MEAN HE COULD BE DEAD BUT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW IT THEY CAN'T VERIFY IT YET THEY  (fe_03_08675-B-0052)
HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERE THE GUY IS  (fe_03_08675-B-0053)
[MN] WHICH IS AMAZING  (fe_03_08675-B-0054)
WELL OH [LAUGHTER] IF WHICH WHICH IS PRECISELY WHAT PEOPLE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES SAY ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT THOUGH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-B-0055)
OH MY  (fe_03_08675-B-0056)
I THINK MAYBE JUST THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WOULD BE A BETTER WAY WITHOUT KILLING [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-B-0057)
SO I'M NOT SURE I'M UP FOR THE ASSASSINATION PLOT I JUST THINK IT'S BETTER TO WELL I JUST THINK IT'S SAD THAT PEOPLE DON'T VOTE THE  (fe_03_08675-B-0058)
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY DON'T EVEN EXTEND THE RIGHT TO VOTE THAT'S A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE COUNTRY I THINK  (fe_03_08675-B-0059)
BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU STOP VOTING AND THEN LET OTHER PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS FOR YOU THAT'S A PRETTY DANGEROUS THING  (fe_03_08675-B-0060)
[LAUGHTER] WELL I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS  (fe_03_08675-B-0061)
[LAUGHTER] WELL THERE'S A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COMING IN A YEAR AND A HALF SO THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME I RECOMMEND DOING IT BY ABSENTEE BALLOT IT'S MUCH EASIER THAN HAVING TO ACTUALLY GO SOMEWHERE ON VOTING DAY  (fe_03_08675-B-0062)
BUT ANYWAY I THINK THAT  (fe_03_08675-B-0063)
ANY TIME I MEAN THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE TO LET SOMEONE ELSE DO THINGS FOR YOU BUT  (fe_03_08675-B-0064)
TURNING OVER TOO MUCH POWER TO PEOPLE TO DO THINGS ON FOR YOU IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS AND I PERSONALLY AM A LITTLE WEARY OF SOME OF THE POLITICIANS I WANNA BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THEM ARE GOOD AND SOME OF THEM SEEM TO BE GOOD BUT UNFORTUNATELY  (fe_03_08675-B-0065)
SOME OF THEM SEEM TO BE NOT SO GOOD EITHER  (fe_03_08675-B-0066)
WELL I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU CALL PATRIOTIC I MEAN THAT A PERSON VOTES OR DOESN'T VOTE I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAD A BEARING ON THEIR PATRIOTISM WHETHER IT YOU KNOW I THINK OUR COUNTRY HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT LIKE OUR PRESIDENT  (fe_03_08675-B-0068)
AND THAT'S THAT'S PART OF FREE SPEECH YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08675-B-0069)
BEING ABLE TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT  (fe_03_08675-B-0070)
SO  (fe_03_08675-B-0071)
IF A PERSON DOESN'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY IT BUT I STILL SAY IF YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT OR SOME OTHER ELECTED OFFICIAL YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08675-B-0072)
THE GOOD THING TO DO IS JUST TO VOTE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-B-0073)
IT'S THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS  (fe_03_08675-B-0074)
BUT I DO SERIOUSLY SAY THAT IS A BIG THREAT TO OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE LIKE WHAT THIRTY PERCENT VOTING EACH TIME THERE'S AN ELECTION  (fe_03_08675-B-0075)
WHICH MEANS THIRTY PERCENT IS THE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE TO VOTE IT'S AMAZING I MEAN CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THE RESULTS IF A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE VOTED OR EVEN EIGHTY PERCENT  (fe_03_08675-B-0076)
IT WOULD BE AMAZING AND THEN WE WOULD REALLY HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF BY THE MINORITY  (fe_03_08675-B-0077)
UH IT'S LIKE THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OR SO  (fe_03_08675-B-0078)
PRETTY LOW  (fe_03_08675-B-0079)
SO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08675-B-0080)
IF PEOPLE ACTUALLY VOTED MAYBE IT'D BE DIFFERENT YOU NEVER KNOW WHO WOULD BE ELECTED IF EVERYONE VOTED WHO KNOWS MAYBE IT'D BE MICKEY MOUSE  (fe_03_08675-B-0081)
[LAUGHTER] ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAD AT THE SYSTEM WOULD PROBABLY VOTE SOMEONE ELSE IN  (fe_03_08675-B-0082)
SHOCK EVERYBODY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08675-B-0083)
I AGREE  (fe_03_08675-B-0087)
OKAY WELL I GUESS I'M OUT OF  (fe_03_08675-B-0088)
IT IS [LAUGHTER] I MEAN UH I CAN THINK OF A THOUSAND THINGS I COULD SAY BUT I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY ON THIS TOPIC OR SOMETHING [LAUGHTER] OKAY SO LET'S  (fe_03_08675-B-0089)
LET'S JUST SAY OKAY LET'S  (fe_03_08675-B-0090)
