AND UH  (fe_03_08657-A-0103)
CONCERNED WITH WHAT IT'S GONNA DO TO THEIR PARTICULAR GENERATION 'CAUSE I  (fe_03_08657-A-0104)
YOU KNOW I'M I'M UM [LIPSMACK] I GREW UP IN THE  (fe_03_08657-A-0105)
SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES SO UM I WASN'T A BEAT NECK OR ANYTHING BUT UM YOU KNOW I JUST SEE A LOTTA PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY POR- BADLY AFFECTED BY WHATEVER WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE VIETNAM WAR AND MAYBE THAT'S JUST A [COUGH]  (fe_03_08657-A-0106)
MAYBE THAT'S JUST UM AN ABERRATION OR SOMETHING BUT UM  (fe_03_08657-A-0107)

UM FAMILIAR WITH  (fe_03_08657-A-0110)
YEAH  (fe_03_08657-A-0111)
YEAH  (fe_03_08657-A-0112)
HI MY NAME'S ALIHUNDRA  (fe_03_08657-B-0001)
YEAH I GUESS SO UM I GUESS THEIR QUESTION WAS DO WE THINK ANY OTHER COUNTRY IS A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_08657-B-0002)
WELL I THINK IT COULD BE A THREAT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THAT BUSH IS VERY GOOD AT THROWING OUR WEIGHT AROUND AND EVERYONE'S ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF US  (fe_03_08657-B-0003)
SO  (fe_03_08657-B-0004)
AFRAID OF THE UNITED STATES AS A MILITARY POWER YOU KNOW AND WHENEVER SOMETHING GOES WRONG THE UNITED STATES ALWAYS GOES AND STEPS IN AND EVERYBODY SORT OF DOES WHAT THE UNITED STATES DOES EVEN IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT  (fe_03_08657-B-0005)
UM  (fe_03_08657-B-0006)
WELL I MEAN THE RECENT WAR ITSELF THERE WAS A LOT OF  (fe_03_08657-B-0007)
THERE WAS A LOT OF DISSENT TO THE WAR FROM A LOT OF OTHER NATIONS AND YOU KNOW IT IT WAS SORT OF DONE WITHOUT THE AGREEMENT OF A LOT OF  (fe_03_08657-B-0008)
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN AGREEMENT AROUND THE WORLD AND BUSH SORT OF SAID YOU KNOW THE WHOLE YOU'RE EITHER WITH US OR AGAINST US POLICY THAT KIND OF BOTHERED ME A LITTLE BIT  (fe_03_08657-B-0009)
THE THING WITH WORLD WAR TWO IS THAT IT WAS  (fe_03_08657-B-0011)
YOU KNOW MUCH MORE CLEARER THAT  (fe_03_08657-B-0012)
IT WAS IT WAS MUCH CLEARER THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS BAD THIS IS WHAT HITLER'S DOING THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR FACES WITH THIS WAR YOU KNOW EVEN JUST RECENTLY  (fe_03_08657-B-0014)
THEY CAME OUT WITH THEY ADMITTED THAT A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTED THE WHOLE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THING A LOT OF IT WASN'T CLEAR AND A A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENED WENT ON ASSUMPTIONS  (fe_03_08657-B-0015)
SO  (fe_03_08657-B-0016)
SO THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I WAS THINKING I MEAN WE OUR GOVERNMENT SORT OF SAYS THINGS SAYS THEY'RE TRUE AND THEN LATER ON THEY CAN COME OUT WELL MAYBE THEY WEREN'T SO TRUE BUT WE WERE STILL RIGHT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08657-B-0017)
NO HE'S HE'S PRETTY HEAVY HANDED IT SEEMS TO ME  (fe_03_08657-B-0018)
WELL I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE DIDN'T BUT YOU KNOW IT WOULD IT WOULD BE I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURPRISED IF SOMEHOW HE FIGURED OUT A WAY  (fe_03_08657-B-0019)
I DON'T KNOW I I MEAN I THINK I AGREE I HAVE A SISTER WHO'S IN THE MILITARY  (fe_03_08657-B-0021)
AND  (fe_03_08657-B-0022)
YEAH SHE'S ACTUALLY IN THE NAVY  (fe_03_08657-B-0023)
SHE IS TWENTY SIX RIGHT NOW AND I'M A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN SHE IS  (fe_03_08657-B-0024)
AND SHE THE THING THAT THIS BRINGS UP FOR ME IS YOU KNOW THE MILITARY'S SORT OF IT'S AN ORGANIZATION WHERE YOU DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD  (fe_03_08657-B-0025)
AND I ASKED MY SISTER WHAT SHE THINKS ABOUT GOING TO WAR AND ALL THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS OUT IN THE MIDDLE EAST  (fe_03_08657-B-0026)
DURING THE WHOLE START OF THE PROBLEMS IN AFGHANISTAN BUT BUT WELL BEFORE THIS WAR STARTED AND SO SHE [NOISE] SHE WOULDN'T SAY VERY MUCH SHE WOULD SAY YEAH IT WASN'T FUN OUT THERE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE ONE OF THE  (fe_03_08657-B-0027)
UH PERSONS ON HER BOAT DIED WHEN THEY WERE PATROLLING BOATS IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO STOP OIL SMUGGLING  (fe_03_08657-B-0028)
BUT I WOULD SORT OF ASK FOR HER OPINION ON WHAT SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND IF SHE BELIEVES WAR AND WHAT SHE SAYS TO ME WELL YOU KNOW I'M JUST DOING MY JOB I'M DOING WHAT I'M TOLD IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TOO MUCH  (fe_03_08657-B-0029)
SO I WORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE MENTALITY OF PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY I KNOW THEY BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_08657-B-0030)
BUT I MEAN TO GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION I DON'T REALLY SEE I DON'T REALLY SEE THAT YOU KNOW TOO MANY COUNTRIES CAN BE A THREAT TO US BECAUSE  (fe_03_08657-B-0032)
WE SORT OF IN THE PAST HAVE HAD A WAY OF GETTING OTHER COUNTRIES TO AGREE WITH US OR AS IN RECENTLY THINGS HAPPEN JUST WHETHER OTHER COUNTRIES WANT THEM TO OR NOT  (fe_03_08657-B-0033)
AND I SEE US I SEE US DURING THE LENGTH OF BUSH'S PRESIDENCY GETTING INTO MORE CONFLICT I THINK HE'S STARTED  (fe_03_08657-B-0034)
SOMETHING WITH LIBERIA RIGHT NOW SO  (fe_03_08657-B-0035)
YEAH I KNOW THAT MY SISTER MY SISTER WENT INTO THE MILITARY UM  (fe_03_08657-B-0036)
NOT NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO GET AN EDUCATION BECAUSE SHE'S NOT VERY BIG ON ACADEMICS  (fe_03_08657-B-0037)
BUT BECAUSE  (fe_03_08657-B-0038)
SHE CAME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL SHE WENT IN RIGHT  (fe_03_08657-B-0039)
RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND SHE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY INCLINATIONS TOWARDS ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR AND SHE HADN'T REALLY HAD A LOT OF JOBS AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WAS REALLY CALLING OUT TO HER SO THE REASON THAT SHE WENT INTO THE MILITARY IS BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING TO DO  (fe_03_08657-B-0040)
AND LUCKILY SHE'S BEEN REALLY STABLE AND IT'S BEEN A STEADY JOB  (fe_03_08657-B-0041)
AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GET A HOUSE AND  (fe_03_08657-B-0042)
SO THIS WHOLE MILITARY CULTURE THING IS PROBABLY A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE GO IN THERE 'CAUSE IT'S SOMETHING TO DO  (fe_03_08657-B-0043)
WELL I'M I'M TOO YOUNG TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN IT I DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT MY GEN- I MEAN THE PROB- THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT WITH WARS AFTER THE WAR HAS PASSED  (fe_03_08657-B-0044)
