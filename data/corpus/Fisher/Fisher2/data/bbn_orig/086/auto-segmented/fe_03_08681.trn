[NOISE] WELL YEAH BUT THAT THEN THERE'S ALWAYS METHODS OF CIRCUMVENTING THE [NOISE] SYSTEM  (fe_03_08681-A-0009)
SO BUT THE GENERAL BENEFITS OF HAVING COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION IF YOU'RE DOING IT YOURSELF IF FOR LIKE RESEARCH IF YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH YOU HAVE A LOT MORE ACCESS TO  (fe_03_08681-A-0010)
THE [NOISE] RESOURCES ON LINE  (fe_03_08681-A-0011)
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY BE AT THE LIBRARY TO ACTUALLY [NOISE] RESOURCE IT  (fe_03_08681-A-0012)
I AGREE THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BE BAD ABOUT IT IF IT'S ER CONSID- IF YOU CONSIDER A MATH ABILITIES OF CHILDREN [NOISE]  (fe_03_08681-A-0014)
CONSIDER MATHEMATICAL ABILITIES OF CHILDREN IF THEY'RE USING COMPUTERS AS A SUPPLEME- AS ER REPLACEMENTS FOR CALCULATING  (fe_03_08681-A-0015)
MM EXACTLY YOU DON'T SPEND TIME LEARNING IT WHEN YOU CAN JUST GET THE ANSWER IN IN LESS THAN A SECOND ON THE CALCULATOR OR EVEN COMPUTER EVEN  (fe_03_08681-A-0017)
BUT OTHERWISE ER THERE'S I DON'T OTHER MORE BENEFITS TO I THINK EDUCATION IT FOSTERS READING ER IT  (fe_03_08681-A-0018)
FOSTERS MORE ADDITIONAL COMPUTER SKILLS EARLY ON  (fe_03_08681-A-0019)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08681-A-0020)
YEAH GENERALLY IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA I'M I'M SURE COMPUTERS SHOULD BE IN ALL SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW BUT  (fe_03_08681-A-0021)
SOMETIMES FUNDING HAS AN ISSUE FOR THAT BUT  (fe_03_08681-A-0022)
OH LIKE DISTANCE LEARNING  (fe_03_08681-A-0023)
YEAH I I I DON'T SEE THAT AS A BAD IDEA BUT THAT'S SORT OF  (fe_03_08681-A-0024)
YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH DO THAT YOU CAN DO THAT FROM ANYWHERE BUT THERE'S NO CERTAIN GUARANTEE THAT YOU GET THE SAME EDUCATION THE SAME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THAT THE PROFESSORS GIVE THAT YOU GET YOUR ANSWERS FROM THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU COULD FIND OUT  (fe_03_08681-A-0025)
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ER THAT YOU CAN IMPROVE ON OR ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS QUICKLY [LAUGHTER] [NOISE]  (fe_03_08681-A-0026)
YEAH RIGHT IT'S ALSO THE MOTIVATION BY YOURSELF BUT IT LENDS PROBLEMS IF YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS THAT YOU NEED ANSWERS OR SOMEBODY TO EXPLAIN IT TO  (fe_03_08681-A-0028)
SOMEONE TO EXPLAIN THE THE ANSWER TO REASONING OR HOW DO YOU DERIVE  (fe_03_08681-A-0029)
THE ANSWER SO SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I SEE THAT THAT'S SET IN DISTANCE LEARNING  (fe_03_08681-A-0030)
BUT SUPPOSEDLY THEY THEY HAVE UM  (fe_03_08681-A-0031)
THEY HAVE LIKE ONLINE  (fe_03_08681-A-0032)

YEAH SEE I'VE SEEN THAT TOO BUT I THINK ER SOME- THEY'VE BEEN HELD IN LOWER REGARD THAN TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS  (fe_03_08681-A-0035)
I'M SURE A- ANYBODY CAN JUST DO IT FOR YOU THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT'S  (fe_03_08681-A-0036)
SO YOU KNOW THAT ALSO LENDS TO THIS TRYING TO BUY YOUR OWN DEGREE THERE'S SOME STANDARD [NOISE] YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT OFFERING TO SELL YOUR DEGREE  (fe_03_08681-A-0038)

IS THE DOWNSIDE AND I GUESS  (fe_03_08681-B-0009)
IT'S A DOWNSIDE DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE ASKING IS THAT YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GET ANY RESEARCH PAPER YOU WANT OFF OF THE INTERNET WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING IT YOURSELF  (fe_03_08681-B-0010)
WHICH IS PRETTY IMMORAL  (fe_03_08681-B-0011)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08681-B-0012)
RIGHT I MEAN I I DON'T SEE I REALLY DON'T SEE ANY DOWNSIDE TO IT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S THAT IT TAKES AWAY FROM ANY OF THE TRADITIONAL YOU KNOW WRITING AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S PLENTY OF IT  (fe_03_08681-B-0013)
