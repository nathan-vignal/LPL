HI I'M CLIVE  (fe_03_08664-A-0001)
NICE TO MEET YOU  (fe_03_08664-A-0002)
DON'T KNOW I I I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE A THREAT I MEAN THEY'RE SO FAR AWAY  (fe_03_08664-A-0005)
EM I I THINK WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO I- IS TO [NOISE] GET SOME KIND OF LEVERAGE TO GET SOME KIND OF AID  (fe_03_08664-A-0006)
[NOISE] YEAH I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S JUST THAT AS I SAID BEFORE GEOGRAPHICALLY WE'RE SO FAR AWAY I I  (fe_03_08664-A-0008)
[MN] THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS SABER RATTLING FOR A WHILE I I [NOISE] DON'T KNOW IF I I REALLY THINK THEY'RE A THREAT  (fe_03_08664-A-0009)
EM THEY'RE MORE A THREAT TO JAPAN AND UM SOUTH KOREA BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BEING A THREAT TO THE U._S.  (fe_03_08664-A-0010)
YEAH DIRECTLY TO THE U._S. I'D SAY  (fe_03_08664-A-0011)
UM I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BEING SAFE I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE AS BIG AS WE ARE YOU'RE NEVER REALLY SAFE  (fe_03_08664-A-0013)
IN TERMS OF BEING A THREAT I I TEND TO THINK AND THIS IS KIND OF [MN] EM UNUSUAL BUT I SEEM TO THINK OF SAUDI ARABIA  (fe_03_08664-A-0014)
I MEAN IF YOU THINK OF NINE ELEVEN MOST OF THOSE TERRORISTS CAME FROM SAUDI ARABIA  (fe_03_08664-A-0015)
WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I KEEP THINKING THAT MOST OF THE THE GUYS WHO WERE ON THOSE PLANES  (fe_03_08664-A-0016)
CAME FROM SAUDI ARABIA I MEAN WE'RE GOING INTO IRAQ AND ELSEWHERE AND I KNOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AN ALLY BUT THE FACT IS THAT MOST OF THOSE GUYS CAME FROM SAUDI ARABIA  (fe_03_08664-A-0017)
AND I KEEP WONDERING EXACTLY [NOISE] WHAT ARE WE DOING  (fe_03_08664-A-0018)
ABOUT THAT YEAH  (fe_03_08664-A-0019)
WHICH IS WHY I KEEP THINKING YOU KNOW I MEAN I'M NOT THINKING IN TERMS OF A COUNTRY PER SE BECAUSE THE FACT IS I THINK WE'RE BIGGER THAN MOST COUNTRIES  (fe_03_08664-A-0022)
I DON'T THINK A SINGLE COUNTRY'S GONNA ATTACK US EVEN NORTH KOREA I MEAN WE'RE OUTSIDE OF THEIR RANGE ANY KIND OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS THEY MIGHT HAVE UM I KEEP THINKING ITS YOU KNOW WHICH COUNTRY IS HARBORING  (fe_03_08664-A-0023)
THESE GUYS WHO COULD POSSIBLY HURT US AND I KEEP GOING BACK TO SAUDI ARABIA  (fe_03_08664-A-0024)
Y- YOU KNOW AND AS I SAID MOST OF THOSE GUYS WHO WERE ON THOSE PLANES CAME FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND I KEEP THINKING EXACTLY WHAT ARE WE DOING BEHIND THE SCENES  (fe_03_08664-A-0025)
TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF BREEDING GROUND [NOISE] THING IS STAMPED OUT  (fe_03_08664-A-0026)

[NOISE] WELL IN A WAY I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE A BIGGER THREAT THAN IRAQ BECAUSE MY FEELING IS IN A I MEAN I DON'T THINK THEY WERE A THREAT A DIRECT THREAT BUT I IN IN ANYWAY I THINK THEY THEY WERE ALWAYS A MORE [MN]  (fe_03_08664-A-0033)
A BIGGER THREAT THAN IRAQ BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHEREAS WE WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE THAT THE IRAQI'S HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE'RE SAYING THE IRAQI'S MIGHT HAVE W- UM  (fe_03_08664-A-0034)
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS WHILE WE WERE SURE THAT THE NORTH KOREANS ACTUALLY HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS  (fe_03_08664-A-0035)
MY FEELING IS SO YOU'RE GOING AFTER THE LESSER THREAT  (fe_03_08664-A-0036)

YOU KNOW SO I STARTED THINKING YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T THINK IRAQ HAS ANYTHING OR WE WOULDN'T BE SO GUNG HO ABOUT GOING IN THERE AND GOING AFTER THEM  (fe_03_08664-A-0048)
SO SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I I MEAN WHILE I [NOISE] I STILL DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE A DIRECT THREAT THEY'RE DEFINITELY IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THREAT OUT THERE THEY'RE DEFINITELY A BIGGER THREAT  (fe_03_08664-A-0049)
THAN IRAQ EVER WAS  (fe_03_08664-A-0050)
AND THEY STILL ARE I MEAN I WAS READING SOMETHING IN THE NEW YORK TIMES WHERE THEY WERE SAYING THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE NUCLEAR BOMB  (fe_03_08664-A-0051)
I MEAN THEY'RE NOT QUITE SURE THAT THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY ISN'T QUITE SURE THAT THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH BUT THEY KEEP SAYING THEY HAVE IT  (fe_03_08664-A-0052)

AND THEY'RE IRRATIONAL AND THEY HAVE ER ER THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE WEAPONS THAT THEY SAY THEY HAVE SO I DON'T SEE YOU'RE GONNA SEE US GOING INTO NORTH KOREA ANYTIME SOON AT ALL [NOISE]  (fe_03_08664-A-0062)
I MEAN I DOUBT THAT VERY MUCH BUT I MEAN I GET YOUR POINT IN TERMS OF [MN] LOOKING AT [MN] COUNTRIES FROM A A TRIP STANDPOINT AND PUTTING THEM ON A SCALE  (fe_03_08664-A-0063)
THEY WERE DEFINITELY HIGHER UP ON THE SCALE THAN IRAQ  (fe_03_08664-A-0064)
[NOISE] YOU KNOW BUT  (fe_03_08664-A-0065)
MHM BUT AS I SAID BEFORE TO MY MY THING IS THAT IN TERMS OF A THREAT I DON'T THINK IT WAS A SINGLE COUNTRY I MEAN THERE'S NORTH KOREA BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S JUST A SINGLE COUNTRY THAT WE'D RATHER LOOK AT  (fe_03_08664-A-0068)
AND SEPTEMBER ELEVEN SHOWED THAT THAT THE REAL THREAT IS FROM COUNTRIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THESE GUYS THAT ARE SERVING AS THESE BREEDING GROUNDS FOR THESE GUYS AND MY FEELING IS THAT SAUDI ARABIA IS LIKE  (fe_03_08664-A-0069)
I MEAN THE THE EVIDENCE SHOWED IT LIKE SIXTEEN OF THE TWENTY OR WHATEVER HIJACKERS WERE FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THAT  (fe_03_08664-A-0070)
