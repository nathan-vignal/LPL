WELL THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW HOW TO LEARN HOW TO SPELL 'CAUSE THERE'S SPELL CHECK  (fe_03_08680-A-0007)
YOU KNOW IT'S KINDA LIKE A TWO WAY STREET I WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO GET LESS GRADES THAT ARE LOWER BECAUSE OF THEIR SPELLING DIFFICULTY  (fe_03_08680-A-0008)
SO THEREFORE THE COMPUTER WITH SPELL CHECK WORKS WELL  (fe_03_08680-A-0009)
