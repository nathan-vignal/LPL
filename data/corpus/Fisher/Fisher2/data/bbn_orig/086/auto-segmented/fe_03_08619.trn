SO DID YOU HEAR THE TOPIC OF THE DAY  (fe_03_08619-B-0003)
YES  (fe_03_08619-B-0004)
A COUNTRY THREAT  (fe_03_08619-B-0005)
WHICH COUNTRY  (fe_03_08619-B-0006)
HOW ABOUT KOREA  (fe_03_08619-B-0007)
REMEMBER THAT'S THE ONE THAT ER THAT GOT THAT CRAZY DICTATOR AND HE'S HE'S ER GOING TO BUILD A NUCLEAR BOMB TO PROTECT HIMSELF  (fe_03_08619-B-0008)
YES  (fe_03_08619-B-0010)
DID YOU  (fe_03_08619-B-0011)
NO I DON'T THINK SO ANYMORE NOT SINCE ER AFTER THE CUBA CRISIS  (fe_03_08619-B-0012)
UM STARTING THAT AGAIN I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08619-B-0013)
SURE DID YOU LIVE IN ER EUROPE IN WORLD WAR TWO  (fe_03_08619-B-0014)
OH YOU LIVED HERE IN U- AND THEY STILL HAD THOSE AIR RAIDS  (fe_03_08619-B-0015)
YES  (fe_03_08619-B-0016)
YES I REMEMBER WE HAD BOMB SHELTERS  (fe_03_08619-B-0017)
YEAH WE DID THE PRACTICE WAS GOING DOWN TO THE BOMB SHE- SHELTERS TOO  (fe_03_08619-B-0018)
BUT TODAY I THINK THE THREAT IS N- NOT SO MUCH FROM A COUNTRY BUT FROM PIRATES AND SCAVENGERS AND [NOISE]  (fe_03_08619-B-0019)
I I THINK THEY HAVE THAT THEY HAVE QUOTAS ON ER CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND THEY ONLY LET SO MANY PEOPLE IN I MEAN THERE IS AN IMMI-  (fe_03_08619-B-0020)
YOU THINK THERE'S ACTUALLY PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES COMING HERE TO THE UNITED STATES AND SETTING UP RESIDENCE ER AND HIDING THESE ARE HIJACKERS THAT  (fe_03_08619-B-0021)
BUT THEY WEREN'T AGENTS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY THEY WERE TERRORISTS  (fe_03_08619-B-0022)
OH  (fe_03_08619-B-0023)
WELL I GUESS I UNDERSTOOD THE TOPIC A BIT DIFFERENTLY THEY  (fe_03_08619-B-0024)
THEY SAID COUNTRY IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR A COUNTRY TO THREATEN THE UNITED STATES IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_08619-B-0025)
I MEAN THEY CAN THREATEN ALL THEY WANT BUT TO ACTUALLY BE A THREAT  (fe_03_08619-B-0026)
I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY COUNTRY OUT THERE THAT CAN  (fe_03_08619-B-0027)
CAN STAND UP TO OUR DEFENSES OR OUR OFFENCES  (fe_03_08619-B-0028)
WELL TERRORISTS THAT'S DIFFERENT YOU KNOW THAT  (fe_03_08619-B-0029)
THAT'S UNDERHANDED THAT'S ER DECEITFUL AND DECEIVING AND ER YOU KNOW THEY USE ER YOU KNOW REALLY UNDERHANDED METHODS IN GUERILLA WARFARE  (fe_03_08619-B-0030)
COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS BETWEEN THEM  (fe_03_08619-B-0031)
I THINK WE HAVE HOME GROWN TERRORISTS  (fe_03_08619-B-0032)
BORN AND RAISED IN THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_08619-B-0033)
ER WELL YOU KNOW MOST TERRORISM SPAWNS FROM A ER ER A A PERSON OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT FEEL NEGLECTED OR ER SOMEHOW THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR SHARE  (fe_03_08619-B-0034)
KIND OF IRONIC BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE PEACE AND FREEDOM NO ONE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF HAVING SOMEONE COME AND BULLDOZE THEIR HOUSE DON'T YOU  (fe_03_08619-B-0035)
SO EVERYBODY IS REALLY ER SHOULD LIVE IN IN PEACE AND AND FREEDOM AND HAVE THE FREEDOM TO TO CRITICIZE THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THINGS WE DO HERE IN THE UNITED STATES UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT LIKE THAT EVERYWHERE  (fe_03_08619-B-0036)
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT REALLY ER ER SPAWNS TERRORISM TOO IS THOSE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL FREE THEY FEEL THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR SHARE AND IT'S NOT REALLY THE UNITED STATES THAT'S AT BLAME  (fe_03_08619-B-0037)
IT'S THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR THEIR LOCAL SITUATION  (fe_03_08619-B-0038)
YOU KNOW LIKE LIKE LIKE WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT SADDAM YOU KNOW HE DIDN'T REALLY ER HE HAD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OIL REVENUES BEFORE THE GULF WAR AND HE DIDN'T REALLY USE THAT TO FEED HIS PEOPLE OR BRING THEM OUT OF A STATE OF POVERTY WE CAN SEE ON THE NEWS HOW  (fe_03_08619-B-0040)
RIGHT SO HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING HE JUST SPENT THAT MONEY ON WEAPONS AN- AND WHO ELSE YOU KNOW OR WHAT ELSE HE HAD GOING HIS PALACES AND AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_08619-B-0041)
SO THOSE COUNTRIES COULD RISE TO BE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES AT SOME POINT  (fe_03_08619-B-0042)
AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT ER  (fe_03_08619-B-0043)
WELL EACH TIME UM THESE THINGS THERE'S THERE'S JUST ANOTHER TOPIC AND THEY THEY WANT TO KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND I THOUGHT YOU YOU HAD A A REALLY A REALLY VALID POINTS FROM YOUR FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_08619-B-0044)
AS YOU SAID YOU'VE LIVED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THOSE R- RAIDS AND THINGS  (fe_03_08619-B-0045)
AND CHINA'S A BIG COUNTRY THEY HAVE LOTS OF WEAPONS AND WELL THEY THEY SAY ER FIVE MILLION MAN ARMY OR MORE  (fe_03_08619-B-0046)
ER WE HARDLY ER FIELDED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS IN IN IRAQ YOU KNOW ER  (fe_03_08619-B-0047)
NO  (fe_03_08619-B-0048)
WELL I THINK ACTUALLY I THINK OUR RELATIONS WITH CHINA ARE PRETTY GOOD DON'T YOU  (fe_03_08619-B-0049)
YEAH  (fe_03_08619-B-0050)
I THINK SO TOO I MET SOME RUSSIANS I DO BUSINESS WITH SOME RUSSIANS  (fe_03_08619-B-0051)
THEY THEY SEEM TO BE VERY FRIENDLY PEOPLE  (fe_03_08619-B-0052)
SURE  (fe_03_08619-B-0054)
WELL THE ONLY COUNTRY I THINK THAT WOULD GO TO WAR WITH US WOULD BE KOREA OR DECLARE WAR ON US OR TRY TO ATTACK  (fe_03_08619-B-0055)
I KNOW THEY'RE SUCH A LITTLE COUNTRY BUT THERE'S TROUBLE  (fe_03_08619-B-0056)
BUT THAT THAT DICTATOR HE'S SO ER  (fe_03_08619-B-0057)
WELL IT'S ALWAYS HIS WAY OR THE HIGHWAY YOU KNOW THAT TYPE YOU KNOW THAT TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE THAT IT'S HAVE YOU EVER SEE- HEAR THAT SAYING HIS WAY OR THE HIGHWAY IT'S SOMEBODY THAT WANTS IT HIS WAY OR HE IT'D GO AWAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO BE AROUND IF THEY IF THEY CAN'T HAVE IT THEIR WAY  (fe_03_08619-B-0059)
THAT'S HOW THAT THAT DICTATOR IN KOREA WHAT IS HIS KIM  (fe_03_08619-B-0060)
KIM YU SUNG OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_08619-B-0061)
HE'S A HE SAID THAT IF THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T ER GIVE IN TO HIS ER WISHES AND SIGN THAT HE WANTS THE UNITED STATES TO SIGN A TREATY WITH THEM NOT TO ATTACK THEM  (fe_03_08619-B-0062)
WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT [LAUGHTER] I THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS THAT HE WANTS TOO BUT HE SAYS IF HE DOESN'T GET ALL THAT HE WANTS HE HE'S GOING TO BUILD HIS NUCLEAR MISSILE AND HE'S GOING TO USE IT  (fe_03_08619-B-0063)
DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN AS A DEFENCE LIKE I DO IS PRETTY STRONG AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT  (fe_03_08619-B-0065)
BEING ATTACKED BY ANOTHER COUNTRY NOT LIKE IN WORLD WAR TWO WHEN JAPAN ER CAME OVER AND ATTACKED PEARL HARBOUR  (fe_03_08619-B-0066)
I THINK ER YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES TO THAT AND TO THE AH NINE ELEVEN BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME INDICATIONS THAT THE JAPANESE WERE COMING JUST AS THERE WERE SOME INDICATIONS THAT SOME HIJACKINGS WENT ON  (fe_03_08619-B-0067)
AND NO NO-ONE ACTED FAST ENOUGH TO STOP THE ER CONSEQUENCE  (fe_03_08619-B-0068)
I THINK THEY WANTED TO MAKE SOME ER THE IMPACT THAT THEY DID  (fe_03_08619-B-0070)
UNFORTUNATELY  (fe_03_08619-B-0071)
BUT  (fe_03_08619-B-0072)
I DON'T THINK OTHER THAN AH COUNTRIES THOUGH  (fe_03_08619-B-0073)
I THINK THE BIGGER THREAT THESE DAYS IS OUR TERRORISTS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID SOME PEOPLE COMING HERE AND LIVING HERE AND JUST SETTING UP RESIDENCE AND THEN  (fe_03_08619-B-0074)
STARTING TO ATTACK FROM WITHIN LIKE LIKE IN THE NINE ELEVEN SCENARIO LIKE WHAT THEY DID THERE  (fe_03_08619-B-0075)
