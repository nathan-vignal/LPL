    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    <p>This file contains documentation on the Fisher English Training Part 1, Transcripts, Linguistic
    Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T19 and isbn 1-58563-314-3.

    <p>This corpus represents the first half of a collection of
conversational telephone speech (CTS) that was created at the LDC
during 2003.  It contains transcript data for 5850 complete
conversations, each lasting up to 10 minutes.  In addition to the
transcriptions, which are found under the "trans" directory, there is
a complete set of tables describing the speakers, the properties of
the telephone calls, and the set of topics that were used to initiate
the conversations.</p>

<p>The second half of the collection (Fisher English Training Transcript
Data, Part 2) will be released by the LDC in 2005, and will be
organized as an extension of the Part 1 corpus.  Taken as a whole, the
two parts comprise 11,699 recorded telephone conversations.</p>

<p>Data collection and transcription were sponsored by DARPA and the
U.S. Department of Defense, as part of the EARS project for research
and development in automatic speech recognition.</p>
