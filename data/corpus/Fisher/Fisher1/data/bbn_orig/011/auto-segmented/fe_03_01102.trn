GOOD HOW ARE YOU  (fe_03_01102-A-0003)
I GUESS SO SO IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT BUS- OPENING A BUSINESS  (fe_03_01102-A-0004)

SURE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01102-A-0006)
UM LET'S SEE I'VE ACTUALLY AH  (fe_03_01102-A-0007)
HAD A SMALL BUSINESS WITH THE FAMILY BEFORE  (fe_03_01102-A-0008)
SO  (fe_03_01102-A-0009)
IF I HAD UNLIMITED FUNDS THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING BECAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY AH THE OLD SAYING OF IT TAKES MONEY TO MAKE MONEY  (fe_03_01102-A-0010)
I THINK THAT'S [MN]  (fe_03_01102-A-0011)
IT WAS A UM  (fe_03_01102-A-0012)
PHOTO DEVELOPMENT LIKE A ONE HOUR  (fe_03_01102-A-0013)

MHM  (fe_03_01102-A-0018)
IT AFTER DOING IT THE FIRST TIME IT'S A LOT ESPECIALLY THAT TYPE OF SERVICE IT'S A LOT OF WORK I WENT THROUGH A PERIOD AS WORKING MY FULL TIME JOB GOING TO THE STORE  (fe_03_01102-A-0019)
WORKING A COUPLE OF HOURS WE'D CLOSE FOR AN HOUR OR SO GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN I WAS BACK AND I WOULD BE THERE PRETTY MUCH THROUGH THE NIGHT WORKING ON ORDERS AND THEN I'D GO HOME TAKE A SHOWER AND GO BACK TO WORK  (fe_03_01102-A-0020)
AND PRETTY MUCH DID THAT FOR ALMOST SIX MONTHS AND FINALLY SAID CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE  (fe_03_01102-A-0021)
SO AGAIN BY HAVING UNLIMITED FUNDS WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT  (fe_03_01102-A-0022)
IF THE BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY MAKING IT UM TO PAY YOUR OTHER BILLS AS WELL WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE IT WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE THE THE STRESS OFF OF  (fe_03_01102-A-0023)
THE SITUATION AND PROBABLY MAKE IT MORE ENJOYABLE  (fe_03_01102-A-0024)
I WOULD BELIEVE THAT I'M SURPRISED IT WOULD EVEN BE TEN YEARS  (fe_03_01102-A-0025)
[MN] RIGHT AND AND THAT'S IT THERE'S A LOT TO INVEST AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO REALISE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE COMING FROM WORKING AT A AT A NORMAL TYPE OF JOB WHERE EVERYTHING'S THERE ALREADY THERE FOR YOU YOU HAVE TO REALISE THAT  (fe_03_01102-A-0026)
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE WAY YOU YOU DO YOUR NORMAL  (fe_03_01102-A-0027)
EVERYDAY ROUTINES AND YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FASTEST MACHINES  (fe_03_01102-A-0028)
AVAILABLE FOR YOU HAVE TO SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT UM NOT GO OUT AND BUY THE BEST OF EVERYTHING TO START WITH UNTIL YOU START GETTING SOME MONEY IN AND AND ALSO SEEING HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK HOW WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS YOU'RE GOING TO BE GETTING IN  (fe_03_01102-A-0029)
FOR REALLY WHAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE CARE OF IT  (fe_03_01102-A-0030)
SO  (fe_03_01102-A-0031)

AT ONE TIME BUT IF YOU START OFF SLOW THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DO BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN  (fe_03_01102-A-0035)

AND AH GET YOUR BUSINESS GROWING THAT WAY AND THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING BUT IT JUST TAKES AH  (fe_03_01102-A-0041)
IT TAKES TIME AND YOU CAN'T RUSH IT AND YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO MAKE MONEY RIGHT AWAY EITHER WHICH IS I THINK A BIG UM  (fe_03_01102-A-0042)
A BIG THING THAT PEOPLE EXPECT AND IT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THEM  (fe_03_01102-A-0043)
I THINK IT'S NOT  (fe_03_01102-A-0044)
