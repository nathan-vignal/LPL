R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Michelle.
L:  I'm Melody.
R:  Hi.  Um, so I guess, um, the question is, if we would take the money or not and I -- I would say, "No".  [LAUGH]
L:  I would have to think about that for a while.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, if it meant that I couldn't talk to my best friend again, [SIGH] I might have to say, "No".
R:  Yes.
L:  That would really be uh, something to think about.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't think I could -- I don't think I would be able to stick with it.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  Because I w- -- I -- m- my emotional needs would just be too great, you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  I would really miss my friend and the input that I get [COUGH]
R:  [MN] I feel exactly the same way but I -- I don't really understand um ... do -- do you understand the purpose of the poll?
L:  They're [MN] trying to collect some nuances of speech or something like that.  That's all I understand.
R:  Nuances ... oh, nuances of speech?
L:  Yeah, that's all I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I -- I just know um ... I wouldn't [MN] -- I mean, I'm not really big on -- I just know I wouldn't.  I wouldn't do that.  I'm thinking --
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't think I could either, you know?  That would be kind of like selling your friendship.
R:  Yeah and th- -- it's putting a value on somebody, you know, that I couldn't --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH] I know I wouldn't be able to do or have to explain to anybody um, my greedy nature.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] No, that would really show you up as a kind of a materialistic person, I think.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sorry, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  That would -- [LAUGH] -- that would be like the ultimate reality show, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That -- actually, that would, um ... "Will you take a million dollars" -- do you know how long the call lasts for?
L:  Um, I believe it was up to twenty minutes, but I don't know --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- if this one would have to last that long ... but --
R:  Oh.  Where do you live at?
L:  Um, I live in the north west.
R:  In the north west?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In what state?
L:  Um, Oregon.
R:  In Oregon?
L:  Mm.
R:  Oh, okay.  I live in California.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  That's kind of funny.  [COUGH] I wouldn't ha- have imagined that it would be another state that ... that they were um having people talk to.
L:  Yeah.  I understand that it could be anywhere around the world.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah and we're supposed to just stick on the -- the topic that they give us, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And -- and [COUGH] how -- how would your best friend handle you --
L:  Oh, I think he wouldn't go for it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because no, no, he wouldn't like it, you know?  I mean, I would just suppose that my best friend would be my boyfriend, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause we share everything and I -- I just could not do that.  It would be too difficult to never be round him again or anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just ...  I mean, I've already lost some people in my life and, you know, I -- I couldn't handle that.
R:  You have wrotten off some people in your life?
L:  Have I what?
R:  You have wrotten off some people in your life?
L:  Oh, no, no.  I've lost them, no.
R:  Oh.
L:  They -- they died, so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so I -- I couldn't handle any more losses.  I mean, especially one that I brought on myself.  [LAUGH] That would really be bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... I just have to say, "No".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I feel exactly the same way.  [COUGH] I mean, I don't ... [COUGH] I had -- my best friend is um, somebody that I've been friends with since I was ten years old and I just -- there's this ... I mean, she's like a sister to me and I would never ... I just would never, ever be able to do something like that.  [MN]
L:  No.  That would -- you- you- you'd lose all those -- those years you had with her and the experiences and ...
R:  Mhm.  [COUGH]
L:  ... you know, future adventures together.
R:  Yeah and she's so supportive to me and I just -- I -- I know I wouldn't be able to do that at all.
L:  No.  That -- that'd be like selling your future, too, maybe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I -- I think.
R:  And also, I mean, losing touch with her family and her children and, you know, our family and her -- and our children and it just wouldn't -- it wouldn't go very well.
L:  No and then --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, maybe, people and, you know, that know you would think you were really lacking, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, they'd -- maybe they wouldn't want to be around somebody that -- that did that, you know?  I wouldn't want to be.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I feel ex- --
L:  I just -- go ahead.
R:  I feel exactly the same way about that.  I just ... I mean, my -- my friendship with her is not -- is -- is not for sale and it wouldn't be worth a million dollars, you know?
L:  No.
R:  To -- to lose it.
L:  That's -- I've watched a lot of those reality shows and -- and some of 'em, I can't believe what they do, just for money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  I mean, the weird things they eat but then, like, this Married With -- Married by America?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I think that is so silly.
R:  I didn't get to see it actually [LAUGH] last night.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Was it -- was --
L:  I only saw parts of it.  [SIGH]
R:  Was it bad or ...?
L:  Oh, I just thought it was kind of sh- shallow.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know uh ... and I saw the Joe Millionaire?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and that was -- it was good but then in other ways it was kind of tacky.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because they -- it seemed like they were all competing for this rich guy that ... you know, and he wasn't really rich.  It was all just a big lie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But I did think the g- -- the right girl won.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I do too, I really do.  [MN]
R:  But I mean, even though they didn't continue to have a relationship, you know?  I still believe that he made the right choice.  [MN]
L:  Sure.  I -- I think so too.  Everybody else seemed kind of -- like, in for it for the money or whatever they could get off of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and they would go -- do anything, go anywhere and I thought that was pretty tacky.
R:  Yes.
L:  But -- but she held out.  She, you know, she held -- uh, kept her values.
R:  Yes, she did.
L:  So, I thought that was pretty cool.
R:  Yeah and she was very family oriented.  I mean, just even her lifestyle, the way she lived her life, you know?  With -- you know, she -- you know, she was a caretaker?  Did you know that?
L:  Yes.  She took care of her grandmother or something?
R:  [MN] I think she took care of older -- uh, she worked for, like, a old folks' home?
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And took [MN] care of um, you know, old people.
L:  Yes.
R:  That's what she did.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN] --
R:  I mean, that -- that says a lot about her right there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah, that takes a lot patience and, you know ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  ... maturity, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To be able to put up with other people's disabilities and ... and then she was really family oriented.  She -- I liked what she said that sh- -- the first thing she'd do with the money, her share of the money is to buy stuff for her family.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And she said -- I guess her aunt had cancer so everything was gonna go towards, you know, helping her aunt to get better, to recover, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  So ... I mean, that seemed [MN] she -- she saved all the necklaces and the jewelry and everything to sell it so that --
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  -- she could take care of her.
L:  That really takes a lot of uh ... well, maybe it doesn't take a lot for her, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but for a lot of people, they just want to keep it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think she's got her head on her shoulders.
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I think money is not everything.
L:  No.  Absolutely.
R:  So [SIGH] ... but I wonder ho- how [LAUGH] much longer [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know if they're supposed to cut it off or what.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, if we're supposed to cut the call off?
L:  No.  I don't know if they're supposed to cut it off or we are 'cause ...
R:  Oh.
L:  How -- how did you join the program?
R:  Um ... I [MN] uh ... they sent me an email.
L:  Oh.
R:  'Cause sometimes they do that.  Do you do the secret shopping?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, you don't?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  How did you -- how did you know about it?
L:  Um, I was doing a s- [MN] -- a search in a search engine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I just happened to stumble across this as I was --
R:  What were you searching for?
L:  Uh, I think --  uh, like, surveys.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Stuff like that.  I -- I do surveys and somehow, I came across this which I thought was pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.  They um ... there was a couple of them ... there's um [SIGH] I think [SIGH] well, the one that um I go through is uh called -- I think it's called The Money and Shopping Network or something like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  And um, they pay you to, like, do secret shops.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you know what a secret shopper is?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen it on the net.
R:  Yeah and some people, they -- they go in or sometimes [SIGH] they send out jobs for, like, people that um ... to do merchandising.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, so they go out to the store and -- that's more kind of a -- a regular -- a regular job, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  To do the merchandising part um ... but they just send out, like, little job things, you know, to earn money, you know?  Extra money?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um ... and that um ... the other one was for um [SIGH] secret shoppers and then [SIGH] I'm also um hooked up on one for doing surveys, so --
L:  Yeah.  I just -- that's interesting.
R:  That they pay you to do surveys.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I mean, [MN] it just varies.  I mean, I -- I did do a merchandising job, like, once a week for Longs Drugstores.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just go in there ... they pay me eleven dollars an hour.
L:  Not bad.
R:  Yeah.  It's not bad.
L:  Like, do you set stuff up or ...?
R:  Yeah, only for um these um one products and I go in and I get the products and I set them out um in ... it's like more in the houseware [MN] -- housewares of Longs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you just go and you set 'em out.  You straighten out everything and then um and then you end up getting ...
