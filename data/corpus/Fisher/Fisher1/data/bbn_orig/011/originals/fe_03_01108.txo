R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is Mary [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] My name is Debra.
L:  Oh, how are you?
R:  I'm doing wonderful.  How are you?
L:  Oh, doing great.
R:  Oh, good [LAUGH].  Did this phone call take you, um, off guard as much as it did me [LAUGH]?
L:  Yes, it did, because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it has been so long since I signed up for this, so I wasn't even thinking about getting a phone call.
R:  Oh, I know, it took me two minutes to find my PIN number because, ah, I -- I've never gotten a phone call --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I couldn't even remember mine, I was on the computer trying to find it in my email --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was, too and I was so happy I didn't delete my PIN number [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I had given up on getting a phone call [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, let's see, I haven't done one of these before, we're supposed to talk about what we could change if we went back in time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something --
L:  Something we've done that we didn't -- we would like changed --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was just trying to think in my mind, what would I change? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  I think it would probably be financial decisions that I've made.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- you know, it's not that, ah, we've done anything terrible --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but you know how, ah, sometimes you'll buy something or ah and then you kind of regret it later ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I know we got a four wheeler --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I kind of wish well, you know, we don't use it as much as we did, maybe I wouldn't have bought that [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nothing earth shattering, you know [COUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I know what it would be for my husband, he had a bad accident and hurt his back and, ah, I know he'd have been more careful climbing [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  [COUGH] Yeah, it's easy to look back [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I've been in a few accidents myself that I wish I could have avoided [LAUGH].
L:  Isn't that the truth [COUGH]?
R:  Oh dear.  Well, I know that, ah, I used to work for Neeman[?] Marcus[?] and we used to have employee sales where we just got phenomenal deals and I -- and they -- they would give us these, um, this was kind of a big employee perk, believe me, they didn't pay us very much, but it was our big perk was, these, um, like the employee salvage sales and, ah, there was a cur- -- not a curio, a -- like an entertain- -- an entertainment armoire that I could have bought for like, you know, only a few hundred dollars that turned out to be like a three thousand dollar armoire -- we never know what's going to be there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, just that sixty seconds that I hesitated and then I bought something, a -- a garden set that I had --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- buyer's regret on [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- then I thought, "Man, I made the wrong decision" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you have to think so quickly and oh dear, and that's probably a pretty silly thing, but I --
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know what you mean.
R:  But every, you know, since then I've only be in a house -- I'm -- I'm thirty two and I've only been in my own house for a few years now so it's kind of like a -- I've needed furniture and it's like I've looked back on that, thinking, you know, I could have used that for my computer, I could have used that for my television --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and when you have to go out and buy r- -- pay retail for things --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- oh, it's so expensive and this was such a beautiful, really fancy, like an Italian piece --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I just, oh and it just makes me sick to think about it, but, you know, it's [LAUGH].
L:  You just have to let it go, don't you?
R:  Yeah.  You just have to let it go and -- and pay retail later and [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as best you can.  I'm sure the person who got it, you know, sixty seconds later was thrilled to pieces [LAUGH].
L:  That's right [LAUGH].  I did actually think of something that I regret.  Uh, when I got married, of course I'm forty three --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, when I got married, like twenty years, twenty three years go now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, I had left some things at my mother and father's house --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and when I went back to get them, my mother and went in one of her cleaning spells and threw them out and I had a Mickey Mantle baseball card --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, ah, it turned out that that baseball card was worth a good bit of money and she had thrown all of my stuff out and that made me sick [LAUGH].  So, if I could go back, I'd probably go back and swipe all my stuff before she threw it all out.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, sometimes those things sneak up on you and you just never know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that is really sad.  Oh dear.
L:  I know we were sitt- -- what it was, it wasn't too long after we got married we were sitting watching television --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and all of a sudden they were talking about this Mickey Mantle baseball card and I said, "I have that baseball card" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, ah, so the next morning I take off and go to my mother's house --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to get my things and oh, "I went through that stuff not too long ago and I threw all that stuff out, I didn't think you wanted it anymore".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so I- -- I'm in a really sick mood [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's so sad [LAUGH].  My parents go through that.  My dad doesn't clean, he just decides like once every few years he just picks up a bunch of stuff and throws it [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that drives my mom crazy [LAUGH].
L:  It doesn't matter what it is, out it goes [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, he just -- just a bunch of stuff, just grabs a bunch of stuff and throws it [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Just gets tired of seeing it, eh, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- out it goes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm, mm mm.
R:  Yeah.  It's sad but true.  I think my other, um, if I could go back in time, the other thing I would change, and I know this probably shouldn't mean anything, especially now that I'm thirty two, but back in -- back in school, that -- that I could have been a cheerleader and I chose not to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because it -- it conflicted with -- with choir which seems so silly now --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it was just my first year and it conflicted with that and I -- and I love to sing and I chose choir and then after that it's kind of like, you really couldn't get back into it.  So and then I -- and I kind of regret it because I would have -- I probably would have been with a different crowd and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm, you know, might have had a little bit more fun in high school because high school's, you know, pretty hard on most of us and -- and sometimes wonder if I would have chose the other, how different my life might have been --
L:  Yeah.  That's something you don't ever know, isn't it.
R:  It -- it --
L:  -- the decis- -- the little decisions you make, it could affect everything.
R:  Yeah.  And I guess I thought that I -- I could do it later if I wanted to, but it was one of those things that once you got into it the first year, they -- they -- cheerleaders were pretty much set for the rest of school and --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it would have been, I probably would have really enjoyed it, but, you know, when you have classes that go up against each other and you have to make a choice, you just try to do the best you can at that type -- time and -- and hope you don't regret it later.
L:  Yeah.  But I guess we all have regrets about something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even if they are insignificant things.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we could probably go on and on all day [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.  Now, do you li- -- where do you live?
R:  I'm in Irving, Texas.
L:  Oh. --
R:  Where are you?
L:  Well, I'm in Mississippi.
R:  Oh.  Mississippi.  I've --
L:  So, we're not too far off [LAUGH].
R:  No, no, I've -- I've driven through Mississippi one time and -- and the only thing I really remember is how -- how tall the -- I think it was wisteria had gone --
L:  Well, probably so --
R:  Oh, and it --
L:  -- ours --
R:  -- just trees and up phone poles and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, it was just gorgeous --
L:  [NOISE] In our town, we -- we have tons of magnolias, that's what -- and older [inaudible] type homes where I live.
R:  Oh, how pretty.
L:  So [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Of course, it's got -- we're kind of -- our town is kind of economically depressed, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know if it -- there's probably tons of places like that [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, that -- that's probably true, um, Irving is, well, home of the Dallas Cowboys, we're in Dallas County and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's, ah, you know, they're talking about pe- -- other places and in our surrounding area have been trying to move the Cowboys away and the stadium and all that and -- and there are some people that are upset about it, but when it comes right down to it, Irving, our city, we don't really see any of that money, I don't know where it goes, you know --
L:  Yeah, and doesn't that make you wonder, when you have things like that, why the -- it's not pumped back into your local economy?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, we have stores that are going out of business here, we have, um, you know a K Mart, a huge K Mart --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just like a lot of places do, that -- it's going under we had, um, just several major stores that are going under and it just seems like that money is not coming to our city and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's really upsetting [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I guess I don't care if they leave or not, I -- I don't think they will, but -- but it's, ah, it's tough and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the area that I live in, um, Dallas, we're, I think, number two in the nation for road rage, they say that three thousand people every week move to Dallas --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- now, we don't have room for them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, when my parents first moved out here with probably like fifteen minutes -- fifteen years ago and, ah, it was, ah, it was just outside Dallas, a little bit further, about ten minutes away from where I was, everything was so countryish --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, ah, boy that is not the case anymore.  It's just -- we've got so many people here that there are plenty of times that it makes you think that you want to move further out into the country because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, now, I -- I guess we're kind of rural --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- and now that might be something I -- I've lived here all of my life, I've never lived anywhere else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and maybe that would be something that, you know, if I could go back in time, I might go back and, ah, make a decision to leave here.
R:  Yeah.
