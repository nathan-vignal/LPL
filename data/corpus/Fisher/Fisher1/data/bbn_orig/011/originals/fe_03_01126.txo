R:  Ruth Carlenti[?].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, nice talking with you.  Ah, they connected me up today, um, the topic today was about time travel and what we would do to go back in time.
L:  Or, what I understood him to say is what we would do if we could change something in -- in the past.
R:  Oh, that's what he said?
L:  I think so.
R:  He was talking so fast [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH]
L:  If we could go back in time and change some -- make different choices or change something.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What I understood.
R:  Okay.  Well, maybe I misunderstood it [LAUGH].
L:  Well, they -- they did say time travel in the beginning and then they clarified it.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  So, w- --
R:  What I w- --
L:  Where are you calling from, Juanita?
R:  Well, I'm from, um, Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, they connected me up today and I just got it a few minutes ago [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Cool.
R:  Mm.  And where are you from?
L:  I'm in Tacoma, Washington.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Long ways away.
R:  I've never -- mhm -- I've been to Washington DC but I've never been to [inaudible] yet.
L:  Oh, no, this is not -- this is, um, in w- -- in the western United States, Washington State --
R:  Oh.  Oh, Washington State.  Oh, okay.
L:  So, it's about thirty miles south of Seattle.
R:  Oh, over there.  You're in the cold, cold state, boy.
L:  Oh, no --
R:  Mm.
L:  Don't get cold here.
R:  It doesn't?
L:  No.  It's a really mild, pleasant climate.
R:  Oh.  Well, it's something like Atlanta, then, because it doesn't get real cold here.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I know where --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've been to Atlanta on -- several times, in fact my brother lives, ah, in South Carolina in Aiken --
R:  Okay.
L:  And sometimes I fly to Atlanta and drive over and see him.
R:  Mm.  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm familiar a little with --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I've never been your way, but you're familiar with me [LAUGH].
L:  Well, it's beautiful.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's very different.  The vegetation's very different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess it's more fresher.
L:  It's -- no, it's just different.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's very green --
R:  That's strange.
L:  -- it's very green here, but it's -- the vegetation's very different.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh.
L:  But it's beautiful in both places.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  So, what would you change if you had a- -- an opportunity to change something?
R:  What would I would change?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would change and make the world a better place to live in and, um, I would have, you know, everybody -- I would try to -- what my change would be, I would want everybody to love each other regardless of what color they were and, um --
L:  That would be good.
R:  Mhm.  And I would make, ah, have a place for the homeless to live that they wouldn't have to live on the street --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I would also would like to work more -- have more people working with older people to keep them going because regardless of what the ages, you still can maintain the age, you can't -- you don't have to go by what man says, it's what you make of your own self.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And make your own self useful.
L:  Yeah.  Well, [inaudible] what I would personally have changed in -- in my -- my life just on a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on a one person basis, is I probably would have, ah, gone to college right out of sc- -- right out of high school instead of getting married.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I think I would have done that.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  If I knew now what I --
R:  -- you know, mhm -- I --
L:  What's that?
R:  Uh-huh.  S- -- I would be like that, too, also because I went from high school and college but before I could finish college I got married.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I wish I had a waited, you know, but I'm happy that I have my two kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but --
L:  Well, I'm -- well I'm happy for that too --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm -- and I'm not regretting being married, I just wish --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I had had more experiences when I was younger.
R:  I know.
L:  And I think ah --
R:  -- [inaudible] we was, at the time when I came up, we was raised the way, we had to be in charge all the time and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we was a close knit family and I had a good mother and father --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- but it was just that they didn't let you go out, venture out too much.  They g-- kept you closely under their wing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I was, you know, g- -- given good values.
L:  I was, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was, too.  I think that's -- I don't think that's a bad way to be --
R:  [NOISE] Nh nh.  No.
L:  Having to raise -- to raise kids --
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  -- and -- and [inaudible].  We were involved in church and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I still am and my -- my children are.
R:  Right.  I'm still in church also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I play for a church sometimes and --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  -- I sing and play, yes, I've been in music ever since I was nine years old.
L:  Well, that's wonderful.
R:  Mhm.  I love it [LAUGH].
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  I just like to entertain, you know, and talk to people and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- get to know, different, you know, their cultures and what they do in life and I just talk with people.  Well, really I talk with people all day because of the work that I do.
L:  What do you do?
R:  I -- I'm a assistant manager, where I manage a hair salon.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, the type of work we do, we do infusions and [inaudible] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I'll be talking with everybody, all nationalities, twenty four hours a day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I'm used to being, you know, talking [LAUGH] it's no problem.
L:  Yeah.  I used to, ah, I used to teach workshops all over the nation --
R:  Oh, you did?  Oh, that was good.
L:  -- the kids --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- who are disadvantaged and inner city kids --
R:  Oh, that was wonderful.  You -- you got good experience.  Well, I did teaching for five years --
L:  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I used to go all over the nation and do that and teach them about --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- teach them about the stock market and --
R:  That was --
L:  -- that's w- -- how I --
R:  Ooh.  That was wonderful.  I w- -- I would love to get in a field like that.  That --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's so interesting to me.
L:  [MN]
R:  I love stuff like that.  I like to venture out and learn different things.
L:  That was a fun time, that was a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a really good experience.
R:  It was real smart with that.  You did chose a good career, though.
L:  Well, actually I just -- I didn't choose it I kind of fell into it and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah --
R:  Well, that was good, too.  It was to your advantage, you know.
L:  Yeah, it was, I learned some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wonderful things.  I had some really good experiences --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- while I was doing it and I made some -- met some great kids, there are some great kids --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- in the world and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- smart ones and -- and ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the most, um, hm, the most rewarding --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- part of that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was when -- when you'd talk to kids that -- that didn't -- that just knew poverty and crime and when you could see the lights come on and when they realized that they didn't have to live that way --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Yes, that's true.
L:  -- that there -- that there are options and it comes from inside --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that part was extremely rewarding.
R:  Mhm.  That was real good.  I like that.  [LAUGH] I love it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I wish that, ah, another thing I wish also that if I could change something is that if we didn't have to go to war --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  And we didn't have to get our, you know, good men killed off and families and other nations and stuff, I just wish we could just pray and work on trying to mend things and put it together instead of fighting.
L:  It's a scary time, isn't it?
R:  Mhm [NOISE] yeah.  [inaudible] out.
L:  A scary time.  Scary time right now.  How old are your children?
R:  Ah, I have one that's um thirty five and one that's thirty two.
L:  Mhm.  That's about the same age as mine.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I have, um, a granddaughter, she's finished high school and I have -- she's ah eighteen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I have another, um, granddaughter and a grandson, he's seventeen years old, they're in eleventh grade --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have one that's in the ninth grade and one that's in the fif- -- in the second grade.
L:  Mhm.  That's w- -- that's [MN] --
R:  So, all of them are doing good.  They're in school and studying and because they know I want them to be something one day, I want them to be great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  That's great. Sounds like you've done some good things and had a good life.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I did [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, you're probably about the same age as me.
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Sounds like it, doesn't it?
R:  [LAUGH] I, ah, [inaudible] age [inaudible] never put a number [LAUGH]
L:  Is that -- isn't that the truth?
R:  That's I always tell everybody, I say, that's man's law.  I --
L:  Isn't that --
R:  -- feel like I'm in my thirties [LAUGH].  But I'm not.
L:  Yeah, me either [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Hey, I wish I could change the age now.
L:  You what?
R:  I wish I could change my age.
L:  Oh.  The only thing I don't like about getting older is that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my body doesn't do what it used to.
R:  I know.  Isn't that something?
L:  It doesn't do what I want it to.
R:  I know.  I hate it [LAUGH].  I'm always saying, what is wrong with you?
L:  So I probably --
R:  Why are you doing me like this?
L:  I probably wish I -- that I hadn't taken it so for granted when I was younger because --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  I probab- --
R:  See, we were so proud of our bodies and we loved it, but we thought we could take it for granted.
L:  Yeah and I didn't -- and I --
R:  And it gets -- we wouldn't get fat [LAUGH] that's my problem --
L:  We -- we didn't -- didn't take care of it like I could have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, that -- I guess that's a regret.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  That's something that -- something I would change is I probably would be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do that a little differently, but -- but for the most part I haven't done too bad [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm happy [LAUGH].  I'm thankful to be here.
L:  Yet the longer I live the more I think that long life is not a gift [LAUGH].
R:  No.  It's serious, it is.  And it -- if -- you know, you think about it sometimes and say, my goodness and you have friends and families just dropping like flies and -- and what I can see the majority of them are young and I've been saying, oh, my gosh, I say, oh, God, please let me live a little bit longer so I can teach a little bit more and do this and do that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I'll be saying stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that to myself.
L:  And squeeze and squeeze those grandbabies more.
R:  Oh, yeah, and I just kiss them and love them and thank God that I'm here to be able to see them grow up and make something of theirselves.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just thank God for that.
L:  Yeah, they are precious, aren't they?
R:  Mhm.  I love them to death.
L:  Me too.
R:  [LAUGH]
