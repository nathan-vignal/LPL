R:  This is uh, Jas- -- Jason.
L:  Jason? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  This is Laura.
R:  Laura, how're ya doing?
L:  Good [LAUGH].  How are you?
R:  [LAUGH].  I'm doing pretty good.
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  It's an interesting question, isn't it?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  So, wh- what -- what -- if you were offered that uh, what would be your uh, answer?
L:  Um [LAUGH], I'd ... I don't know.  It's very hard.  I'd probably say, no [LAUGH].
R:  You'd prob -- really?
L:  'cause ... well, you're not allowed to talk to your best friend ever again [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah but ... I don't know.  I guess, you know, a lot of times um, you -- someone that you thought was your best friend, wasn't, you know?  [MN]
L:  That's true.  I -- I mean ... but like, everybody makes mistakes like ... me and my best friend have been into, like, a million fights but we're still best friends, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, that's true.  I mean, I guess, I think it depends on how long have you -- have you known 'em, you know?  Uh, how long have you known your best friend?
L:  Um, since I was, like, five.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Oh, that's -- yeah, that's a best friend, yeah.  I --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, that's a long -- I don't know how old you are now but I assume it's at least fifteen, twenty years?
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- well, I'm eighteen [LAUGH].
R:  Ooh [LAUGH].  Well, that --
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm uh, thirty one.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah but uh, yeah, I guess, you know, when I was uh younger, um, I had a best friend that I considered best friend and, you know, as we got older it seemed like we, ah, grew apart.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Especially after college, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, we -- we actually both go to school in Boston and, like, um, like, the first semester we spoke a lot but I don't see her that much any more but it's still like --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- yeah but I feel like you don't find a lot of people that you could, like, rely on all the time, you know and it's like, when you do have people like that, I ... I don't know.  I don't know if it's worth -- I mean, unless you really need the money, like [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yes, yeah -- I mean ... I don't know li- ... I don't know, like, I guess a time factor plays a big role as well.  If -- if you had asked me this question, like, fifteen years ago, um, I would have definitely said, no.
L:  Yes.
R:  But, now, I w- -- I would definitely say, yes.
L:  Yeah?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean ... I mean 'cause it turned out that he -- he was not my best friend, you know what I mean?
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, but that's now.  Fifteen years ago it would have been totally different, so I think time comes into play in -- at what stage both people are in, in their lives, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I think ... yeah, I think there are a lot of factors that go into it.  I mean ... like, I don't know.  Just like, with the money, like, you could do -- not like, whatever you want but like, you could do, like, all the things that you've wanted to do in your life.  I mean, I guess a million dollars isn't that much but, you know, and ... I guess [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH].  You know, it's like ...
R:  It's a ni- -- it's a nice start [LAUGH].
L:  It would make uh, things, like, a lot easier, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's definitely a nice start, I think.  I mean, you're a millionaire, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean ... I don't know.  I -- I just uh ... I don't know.  Like I said, it depends on what time [inaudible] in your life or what you go through.  Like, for example, I went to school, he didn't and that [inaudible].
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, that played a big factor in it and it's like, you know, we -- we both changed.  We went in two different directions.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so -- but you and your friend, both of you are going to school but, I don't know, maybe the college experience is different for her than it is for you.
L:  Oh, yeah, it definitely is.
R:  Yeah.  What school you go to?
L:  Um, Boston University.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where do you go?  [LAUGH]  I mean, where did you go, when you went to [MN]?
R:  [LAUGH].  I went to uh, to Ski[?]
L:  Oh, okay.  I've heard of the name.
R:  The univers-.  It's in Alabama.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you in Alabama right now?  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  I'm in Atlanta right now.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's cool. [LAUGH]
R:  What -- are you going to school for?
L:  What?
R:  What -- what are going -- what are you majoring in?
L:  Um, speech and language therapy. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  So, that sort of -- kinda goes with the study here.
L:  Yeah, it's don't know.  Oh, yeah.  I guess it is, pretty much.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know [LAUGH].  It's just --
R:  Yeah but you know, I mean, like ... I -- I guarantee maybe um, you know, hopefully it don't happen that way but ... ten years from now, you might think totally different.
L:  I know.  No, I definitely -- I know, even just like a few months ago, like, we were having problems, like [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you know --
L:  I mean, I guess, like, every best friend I've had ... 'cause like -- I mean, like, there have been points where we weren't close and points where we were close again and, like, times when I was best friends with different people but I just like ... I have been let down, like, by everybody [LAUGH] that I've been friends with but it's still, like, I don't know.  I just think ... 'cause, like, I know I've let down people too, so -- but like, I still need them, you know, like, I still need friends, like.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just think I'd be like, really alone if I didn't have my best friend.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, [SIGH] ... yeah, I mean, like, to never speak to 'em again.  That's kinda ... that's uh ... that's heavy, but I mean, [LIPSMACK] like I say, right now, um, I wouldn't have a problem with it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH].  You know, I mean ... I'm just being honest.
L:  Are you close with your family?
R:  Yes, I am.  I'm um ... you know, I have a brother and a sister.
L:  Me too.  Are they older than you, [inaudible]?
R:  Yeah, the- they're older, yeah.
L:  Oh, me too.  So, you're the youngest?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, we get on.  You know, my mum and dad, I g- get along with uh ... yeah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're a pretty tight family, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I'm really close with my family, too and they just --
R:  You -- you're from Ma- --
L:  What?
R:  You're from Massachusetts?
L:  No.  I'm from New Jersey.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A Massachusetts accent, yeah?
L:  Right outside New York City.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.
L:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  [SIGH]  So, like, I guess, um ... it's like, you -- if you'd still have your family then I guess it's not so bad if, like, you couldn't talk to your best friend [LAUGH] if you took the million dollars.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause, like, I still --
R:  I think --
L:  -- tell, like, my family everything, pretty much.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But I mean, you have -- you have other friends besides your best friend, all right?
L:  Yeah, of course. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, well ... yeah, I mean, as I say, I -- I think, really, the timing of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what matters.
L:  Are you married or anything?
R:  No, no, no. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Not married, no kids.
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  No, I haven't any [inaudible] went in that deep yet.
L:  You're what?
R:  I haven't went in that deep yet.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  No.  You're a sophomore?
L:  What?
R:  Are you a sophomore or a freshman?
L:  No, I'm a freshman.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool, second semester so you have, like, two, three more months before the semester ends?
L:  Yeah, about two months.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it's ... [MN]
R:  How're you liking it so far?
L:  Um ... it's pretty good.  I like it.  It's um ... it's like a city school so there's not really, like, communities, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ... and it's like, really, really big.  There's like, thirty thousand people [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That's why I went to go to Ski, you know?  Small school, small town.
L:  Yeah.  My brother went to, like, a really small school in Man[?] Island and, like, you, like loved it.  Like, I -- like, I really like school.  I j- -- I don't like a lot of it though, you know?
R:  Mhm, yeah.  You think you might transfer?
L:  Um, I was thinking about transferring closer to home 'ca- -- like, maybe NYU or something.
R:  Oh, that's a big school too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But just, like, oh, I have a boyfriend who goes to school, like, in Long Island. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I guess, just to be closer to him and, like, with the whole, like, war thing going on uh like --
R: Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Like, I'm ... like, my whole family, like, my brother, like, graduated, so like, he's home and my sister goes to NYU so like, everyone, like, I care about is like, in the New York area and I just feel like I'm the only one that's, like, far away and if anything happened, like, I don't know ... [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] yeah.  I -- I know what you mean.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's understandable.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  But uh, wow, so, I guess your answer would be, right now, no?
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, I don't know.  Actually, now that I think about it, I'm changing -- I think I'm changing my mind!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I think if, like ... as long as I still had my family ... like, I love my best friend but ... I don't know [LAUGH].  It's a really hard question. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it is, it is but I don't know.  I -- I -- I can answer it easily right now and say uh, "Yes, just give me the money".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I hope they hear me too and maybe they send me a million dollars [inaudible] [LAUGH].  I doubt it --
L:  Yeah.  Like, I don't even ... actually, like ... like, my friend wants to, like, stay in Massachusetts when she graduates and, like, I want to go to California [LAUGH] so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Like, in a few years we may not even be talking [LAUGH], you know, like ...
R:  Oh.  So, you --
L:  So, if that was the case, like, I could definitely see us, like, growing apart and not talking and ...
R:  Oh, you might get cl- ...
