L:  Hi.  Hi, my name is Sherrie.
R:  Hi, Sherrie, my name is Rob.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  [LAUGH] This is weird.  This is my first time doing this.  Have you done this?
L:  Um, no I haven't.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, if I could go back in time and redo one thing.  Um, I don't know, I suppose I would stay in college because I went for only two years and I dropped out for financial reasons.  But, I guess if I could change that I would try harder, you know, to stay in like for a scholarship or something.  So, I think that would be mine.
L:  Um, yeah I could probably go along with the same lines.  I only did, like, a semester.
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I had -- had gone to frontier decorating which I thought I had wanted to do and then I decided I didn't like it after one class and so, I quit.
R:  Really?  I had kind of a similar situation.  I wanted to go for journalism, um, but then once I got there I realised that all I was attracted to was, like, the layout design part of it.  I didn't really have any interest in the real, like, reporting or [LAUGH] --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- you know, that kind of -- that part of it.  So, you know, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do.  But I guess I had a -- it just got too much, you know, money wise.
L:  Right.
R:  And I just decided to go into the workforce.  So ...
L:  Yep.  Same here.  I was already -- I already had one kid and then I got married and had more and so it just was easier not to do it.
R:  Yeah, I know, me too.  And now I'm actually finally looking to go back.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I thought about it about a year ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, so far I haven't done it yet.
R:  Mhm.  Well, my hometown has this, like, [MN] they're calling it an accelerated degree programme where they say if you have no college experience you can get a degree in two years.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, I'm thinking, "Well, with, you know, having almost two years, then maybe I can finish it in less time".
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm going to go back for computers because that's kinda become my thing now.  So, that will be really good money once I, you know, finish it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just think it's going to be really hard.  [LAUGH] Probably --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of maths and stuff.
L:  Yeah, maths is not my thing.
R:  Me neither.  [LAUGH]  I mean, I -- I do well at it.  I got level -- good -- a good B student in math but I don't like it at all. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [MN]
L:  Ah, no, you can't, dear.  I'll talk to you about it later, okay, honey?  [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I'm on the phone right now.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah actually I'd thought about doing writing a lot.
R:  Writing? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I like to write too but, I mean, just, ah, talking to other students it was like, well, um, you'd be woken up in the middle of the night to go report on some fire or something and I'm like no, that's not what I want to do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I think it makes it di- it makes a big difference when you do something for fun and then when you actually start doing it for making the money and you're his livelihood --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, I guess that I was going[?] to turn[?] chief for my highschool newspaper and I did, ah, you know, like, the desktop publishing part of it on a computer and that's what I really liked.  I still like doing that kind of stuff so hopefully I can keep that.  But -- writing, yeah.  I was actually going to be an English major.  I toyed with that for a while.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I kind of wanted to teach English.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Highschool?  Grade school?
R:  I was thinking about highschool.  But then, you know, and I thought about it I'm like, highschool classes are tough --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, those kids can have a lot of attitude.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] And they're really mean, so, I'm like, mm I don't know, maybe college.  But, then that idea kind've flew out the window too.  I actually -- I -- my minor was Spanish and I am one class away from completing that --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- with certification to teach but, I don't know if I'll -- I probably will pursue that, I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- since it's only one class.  So, if you went back are you still going to go for interior design?
L:  Oh, probably not.
R:  No?  What would you go for?
L:  Um, I've toyed with either a travel agent or something with writing.
R:  Mm.  Well, travel agent.  That's kind of interesting, I think.
L:  Yeah, that seems like it would be neat.
R:  Yeah, I worked in hotel reservations for a year and a half.  So, it's an interesting field.
L:  I work in a doctor's office right now --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  -- so --
R:  Like the office?
L:  Yeah, receptionist.
R:  Mm, yeah.  That's what -- that was my last job was receptionist, for a business though.  So, I'm kinda tired of the, you know, entry level type stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, if I don't finish my degree that's all I'm ever going to have.
L:  Right.
R:  -- so ... but then again it's just me.  So, it's not like I have a fam- husband, or ch- children to think about like you do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  This wasn't quite what I -- when they said time travel I didn't think it was going to be your own life and actual experiences.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I thought it was going to be like if you could go some place in the future, or -- 
L:  That's what I thought too.  If you could either go in the past or the future where would you want to go?
R:  I didn't think you would actually have to talk to someone [LAUGH] I thought it was -- not that I mind talking to you, you seem very --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- nice, but it's like, I thought they were just going to record you talking, you know?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or [LAUGH] -- it's kinda weird.  It's like don't we get paid for this?  What does it say, like ten dollars a call or something?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Yeah, I figured -- 
R:  -- so -- 
L:  it sounded like an easy ten dollars.
R:  Yeah, that's what I thought too -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'm like, well, I need money right now, so [LAUGH] I actually -- did you get the one about the soup?  I got another --
L:  No. 
R:  -- one that was like, if you agreed to be on a conference call talking about soups [LAUGH] then we'll pay you twenty dollars.  And I agreed to it, but I never got any more.
L:  No, this was the first one I got.
R:  [LAUGH] I never got any more information, so I guess I missed that one.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah, I get this kinda stuff all the time and I'm like, "Ah, I don't know".
L:  Figured I'd see if it actually worked out or not.
R:  Mhm.  Well, now we have to see if we get the money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ex- exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] It seems pretty legit though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know, the only thing is I got the email like two or three weeks ago that said it would be coming within a couple of days and it's just first coming now.
L:  Yeah, that's about when I got it too.
R:  [LAUGH] So, you know, I kind of forgot about it until I just came home and saw it on my caller ID.  I'm like, "Oh".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, how long are we supposed to talk?  Did it say?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm not sure what time it started.
R:  I'm not sure either.
L:  It seems like a long ten minutes.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Um, Iowa.
R:  Do you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh I'm -- I'm -- I live in Wisconsin but I'm moving back to Iowa this weekend.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, to the Buke[?].
L:  Hm.  I'm in the Quad cities.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I kind of know that area.  We used to go down there for shopping 'cause, you know, at the Buke there's nothing.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've --  
R:  So.
L:  -- never really been there.  We've only lived here a few years.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I think I've been their first talker.
R:  Mhm.  There's like -- there's a couple of good miles on the Quad cities.  I know that or at least there used to be.
L:  Yeah, not bad.
R:  When we were in highschool we'd all hang out down there.
L:  My son would about die if he heard that people actually travelled to the Quad cities to do stuff.
R:  Really?[LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Why, where's he from?
L:  Oh, we moved here from Maryland.
R:  Oh, from Maryland, okay.
L:  Just outside of DC.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he says that there's nothing here.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm sure it probably seems that way.  We --
L:  Yeah, if --
R:  -- took our class trip to the sea and I remember being overwhelmed.
L:  -- if he could travel back in time it would be that we never moved here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] Really?
L:  That would -- that would be an easy answer for him.
R:  Mm.  Really hates it that much, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, why did you do it?  For jobs or something?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, maybe you can go back.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I figure the next move will be somewhere warm.
R:  Yeah?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I -- I hear that.  It's cold tonight.  I'm like [several inaudible words] to quit teasing us.  One day it's like sixty, seventy -- 
L:  Oh that's -- today we were like seventy five and it's in the sixties now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Here it's like, well I'm in Milwaukee here and now it's like approaching thirty.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  So, it's getting cold.
L:  Hopefully it's not moving this way.
R:  No, and when I left I -- I was like, I left without a jacket and a short sleeved shirt.  So, now when I just came home from my friend's house I was like, "Oh my God".  I'm glad I wasn't wearing shorts too, I'd be totally freezing.
L:  I wonder if it comes --
