R:  Hi, I'm Maggie.
L:  Hi, this is Laurie.  Um -- 
R:  How are you?
L:  -- I've been pretty good.  How are you?
R:  I don't know what we're supposed to do.  Do you?
L:  Um, we are supposed to talk about, I think you said time travel.
R:  Right.  If -- if you could go back and change something.
L:  Mhm.  What would it be?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, hard.  [LAUGH] --
R:  Um, in our -- 
L:  -- come on.
R:  -- personal life.  I know -- I -- I know what I would do.
L:  What would you do?
R:  I wouldn't marry an American.  [LAUGH]  Not because I -- 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- don't like America, but because of things that happened since I've been here.
L:  Oh, where are you from?
R:  England.
L:  You are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm from -- I'm from America.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I love America.  Don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't have married that particular person.
L:  Really? You -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know what?  Something, you know, that makes me think, you know, I probably wouldn't have gotten married as young as I did -- 
R:  I don't think I'd have gotten married at all.  I don't -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like being married.  I am happy single [LAUGH].  I don't -- 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- ever want to be 
L:  -- you know, I am too?
R:  -- married again.
L:  I am too.  Believe me, I just got out of a kinda of a long term relationship and I am so happy, you know, and relieved.  I'm not even sad, you know --  
R:  Oh, I'm -- I'm sixty two, so -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  But, um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had to retire at -- 
L:  I'm thirty two.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're -- you're thirty -- that's exactly what my neighbour is.  He was thirty two yesterday.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, but, um -- 
R:  What would you change in your life if you could?
L:  I probably wouldn't have -- wouldn't have gotten married so young, also.  As I got -- 
R:  Oh, I wasn't young -- 
L:  -- married when I was like -- 
R:  -- I was twenty three -- twenty two -- 
L:  Really -- 
R:  -- when I got married.
L:  -- I was eighteen.
R:  Oh -- 
L:  Yeah, I was eighteen.
R:  -- and I was twenty four when I had my daughter.  But, um, I wished I could've skipped the daughter and gone straight to grandchildren, if you can do that!  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, Lord.  [LAUGH] No, I had a son when I was young.  But, you know, oh I love him so much, and everything, um -- 
R:  Well wait until they get older and then they drink -- 
L:  Yeah, he's fifteen.
R:  -- and do drugs.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And they don't -- 
L:  No. 
R:  -- take care of their children and you end up taking care of them.
L:  Oh, is that what you have to do?  And what you're going through?
R:  Oh, she's -- she's been sober for a year and a half now, so ...
L:  Really?  That's good.
R:  Yeah, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that's what probably what -- but time travel, if I could time travel I would -- 
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- like to go forward in -- I'd like to go into the future, not into the past.
L:  Really?  I'd like to be -- you know what?  I'd like to go back in the sixties -- 
R:  Oh, I was there!
L:  -- I -- I -- I would -- I would -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I would love, oh man -- 'cause I love all the music, you know, the attitude and, you know -- 
R:  So, if you could change -- 
L:  -- everything's --
R:  -- something, you'd be born earlier then?
L:  Born earlier.  Because -- 
R:  I'd be born later and not wear glasses -- 
L:  Really.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I could go into space 'cause I would -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I would -- I've always wanted to go into space -- 
L:  Yeah, that'd be [several inaudible words].
R:  I'm a very young sixty two year old.  Everybody thinks my grandchildren are my children.
L:  [LAUGH] that's funny 'cause I'm -- I'm -- um, I'm, um -- my s- my -- everybody thinks, um, my -- my son -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is actually like my brother.
R:  'Cause you look young.
L:  'Cause I look young but actually, you know, the way I act, um, I'm older than I am.
R:  Oh, well see I've -- 
L:  I've already got --
R:  -- always looked -- 
L:  -- grey hair girl!
R:  Oh, well, I've been dying mine since I was nineteen.  But -- 
L:  Really? I -- I've got grey -- 
R:  Yeah, well -- 
L:  -- hair and --  
R:  -- in the sixties we had a lot of different colored hair.  Fifties -- in the fifties we had pink hair and green hair and blue -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hair and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all those bouffant dos and, you know but -- 
L:  I know.  See, I would love to have hair like that [LAUGH] and I'd like to iron and all that stuff.  You know, I thought -- 
R:  Well, see I still have -- 
L:  -- that was so neat.
R:  -- I still look like a hippy because I have really long hair -- 
L:  You do?
R:  -- almost down to my waist, parted in the middle perfect.  And I'm always trying to get it straight.  And I live up in the mountain so it's -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- always busy up here.  But, ah -- 
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- I guess somebody's recording -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this right?
L:  Yeah, they're recording it.  Oh, and -- and another -- if -- you know, another thing I would -- if I could, you know, travel back in time -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, have you ever seen the show Little House on the Prairie?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would go back -- 
R:  I remember that -- 
L:  -- to that time.
R:  Oh, not me.  I like mod- I'm -- I'm an electronics engineer -- 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] I have a degree in -- 
L:  So, yeah [inaudible] -- 
R:  -- maths and physics, so I'm always into gadgets.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The latest com- computers, all of that.  I'm still into -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- very into computers, so -- 
L:  See, I would like to just have -- um, be a -- 
R:  It's too --   
L:  -- you know -- 
R:  -- much work.  That -- didn't you see that -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- programme they had on PBS about, um, the way they had to live in the old house and they hated it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And that was -- and then they had the nineteen forties -- 
L:  But life was simple -- 
R:  -- house. 
L:  Life was so much simpler.
R:  No, it wasn't.  You had to make your own soap and pump your own water.
L:  Well, at least you weren't doing nothing bad and all this evilness wasn't around ya, you know -- 
R:  Oh, yes it was -- 
L:  -- not like it was -- 
R:  -- think about Deliverance.
L:  -- not like it is now.
R:  Yeah, but there was those weird inbred people that came and killed Jews!
L:  Oh, yeah, well [inaudible] yeah --
R:  You know, like in -- I don't -- you're probably too young for the movie Deliverance but, that was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen to this day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That, and Play Misty for Me.  But, anyway, but um -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- so, what else would you do with -- if you -- you'd like to be back in the sixties.  Would you like to go -- have gone to Woodstock?
L:  Oh, yes, of course. 
R:  Well, I didn't make it to Woodstock but I do -- 
L:  I wish -- 
R:  -- know the Rolling Stones, Tom Jones -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- Dusty Springfield.  My -- my --

R:  I know them.
L:  Back in the days -- 
R:  -- I knew them -- 
L:  Oh, man.
R:  I knew them before they got famous -- 
L:  That is so cool.

L:  I have -- 
R:  Okay, well -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- s- her husband was my husband's best friend.  The guy -- she married an -- 
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- an American.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  A GI -- 
L:  Yeah, um -- 
R:  -- yeah, and then Tom Jones used to play at the American base -- 
L:  Uh-huh.

L:  Where are you at now?
R:  -- I'm in -- I'm in Lake Arrowhead, California.
L:  Oh, I'm in -- I'm -- I'm in Grandperry[?], Texas.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I loved Texas, San Antonio and the Corpus Christie.  I love it there.

R:  -- we're up in the mountains but when the tourists -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- come up here and they want to run you over and they yell at you and -- 
L:  Really.
R:  I don't -- I'm from a polite country, you know -- 
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  -- well, we were.  I'm not sure how polite we are any more but, um, but, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we better get back on the subject, but -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- if I could go back and change -- I -- I probably -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- probably wouldn't be about marrying, but I would like to have been born later.
L:  Really?  Yeah just for -- 
R:  Much later so I could have --
L:  -- 'cause you're into all the technologies and -- 
R:  Yes, yeah.  I would have liked to have been -- 
L:  -- what, you know, might come.  You know, down here, down the road and everything, yeah.
R:  I would have liked to have been born -- 
L:  That's neat.
R:  -- later and not wear glasses because I couldn't fly planes because I wore glasses.  I was in the Royal Airforce and I had to be an air traffic controller because I wasn't --

L:  Mhm.
R:  Now they do.  You know, you can have contacts -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and things.
L:  If I could change something too I would have exer- started exercising at a l- lot younger age -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and take exercising and working out, you know, 'cause now I wish I would have 'cause it's now -- you know, when you get older -- 
R:  Well, I have -- 
L:  -- everything starts catching up with you -- 
R:  Yeah, well I was -- 
L:  -- so it's like, "God".
R:  -- fine till I was fifty five, and at fifty five I -- an old back injury flared up and I ended -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- up having back surgery and a hip replacement, so -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- now I've gained weight, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to be in wonderful shape and I'm not anymore.
L:  Yeah.  I wish I would have played sports and all but, you know -- 
R:  I did that.
L:  -- I always liked volleyball.  I liked volleyball -- 
R:  Actually there's not much about my life except -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for wishing to be born later.  I -- I went to the university, I got a good degree -- 
L:  That's good.
R:  -- I had a good job.  I made a -- quite a bit of money, you know, so -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I live in a lovely place -- 
L:  Well, that's good.  You sound like you're happy.
R:  I am.  I have a --

L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm at the rink and I'm -- have a lot of friends.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  And I read a lot, so --
L:  I read a lot too and I'm -- 
R:  -- I can't think -- 
L:  -- on my computer a lot.
R:  Yeah, me too.  I'm a bit -- 
L:  I'm on my computer like constantly.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I have friends all over the country, ones that I've never met.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm selling them stuff on ebay, or buying stuff from them -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- I'm a big ebay person, but -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I'm trying to think what else I might change.  I -- I'd just like to change my eyesight.  I think that's the main thing -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I have really bad eyesight.  I've three pairs of glasses now.
L:  Uh-huh, my goodness.
R:  And I can't -- and I can never find the ones I need.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's one thing that I -- I don't have.  Um, I've got perfect vision.
R:  But you can still change your weight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All you have to do is eat less.  Just eat a little less and -- and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- walk -- walk a little more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's all it takes.
L:  Yeah, I'm trying.  I've been trying, and it's just not as easy.  You know, it's not easy but it's -- 
R:  Would you -- well, did you smoke?  I probably wouldn't smoke either.  I would probably would change that about myself too.
L:  Yeah, I smoke.  I -- I would -- yeah, that's another thing.  I wouldn't have started smoking.  I wouldn't have even picked it up, you know.
R:  Well, when I was coming up it wasn't -- nobody knew it was so addictive, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Well, we all thought it was just cool, you know, and then it becomes a habit and --
R:  Well, my father -- 
L:  -- well, there you go.  Ah -- 
R:  -- my father told me not so I went right out and bought a pack of cigarettes.
L:  Oh, yeah.  We've do- oh yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, in the fifties -- 
L:  Me too.
R:  -- in the fifties that was major rebellion.  Smoking cigarettes.
L:  Mhm.
