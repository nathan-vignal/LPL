R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  My name's Mr Mendoza.
L:  Hi.
R:  Uh [MN].  I would consider taking the million dollars and communicating with my friend by, uh, writing.
L:  Yeah.  That'll work.
R:  [MN].  If I couldn't do that, though, I'm not sure that I would do it.
L:  Really?
R:  Would you do it for a million bucks?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] without hesitation.
R: [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Well, yeah.  Uh ... I don't know, uh ... if I could write, I'd probably ... certainly do it.
L:  But I don't think you can write.  I didn't think that you can write.  It didn't say you can write but it just said without ever speaking to that person again and writing is a form of communication.
R:  Well, I guess they'd have to be more specific.  I'd have to know, you know, exactly um ... I don't talk much anyways with my friends.
L:  I see.
R:  Huh?
L:  [LAUGH].  I said, "I see".
R:  [LAUGH].  I'm trying to talk now because uh ... it's a speech study, I guess.  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  But um [MN] you know, with um my best friends, I don't really ... well, that's not true.  I talk a lot but I don't mind not talking [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.  You talk a lot when you're comfortable with the person?
R:  Yeah, yeah but if uh ... if I can't talk or shouldn't talk or it's better not to talk or if I'm getting --
L:  You're probably just shy, right?
R:  Uh, well I'm --
L:  Quiet people are usually shy and insecure.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, not with my best friends, although maybe I am, a little bit, with them.  Uh, I don't even know if I have a best friend, first of all [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ... that's kind of funny uh ... uh ... yeah, uh, that's -- that's part of the hypothetical situation.  What if you don't have a best friend and what if you cannot write to them and not talk.
L:  Right.
R:  But uh ... I have had a best friend at different times in my life so ... yeah, you know what?  I'd definitely think about it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  A million dollars can buy you a whole bunch of new friends [LAUGH].
R:  Well ... yeah, I dunno.  Maybe it could [LAUGH].  Maybe.  I don't know 'bout -- I don't know if it could buy me friends.  It could get me somewhere where I could meet more friends, maybe.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  But uh ... [LAUGH].  Yeah, um [MN].  I don't know what to --
L:  Are you being watched right now?
R:  Am I being watched?
L:  Do they monitor you when you call?
R:  They're recording us.
L:  Are they [SIGH]?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I didn't know I was being recorded.
R:  Uh, well, I think they are.  I think they told me when I signed up that uh ... that they record it --
L:  Oh, you're not at the college?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.
R:  No.  Uh ... I'm part of the study, like you are, I guess.
L:  So, how do we know when the phone call's over?
R:  Uh, I think they're gonna say ... uh [MN]
L:  They just want to know what we would do with a million dollars?
R:  Uh, I think what they're doing is recording our conversation and they're just gonna analyze it somehow.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, I don't think they're really concerned so much with our answers as, uh, how we talk to each other and --
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  -- and how -- how we answer it.
L:  I see.
R:  I think --
L:  They're just giving us something to talk about.
R:  Right.  That's what I think.  I'm gonna get on their website and find out more about the research but uh, yeah, I think that's pretty much what they're doing and each time, it's just a different topic to talk about --
L:  Well, where are you calling from?
R:  Uh ...
L:  I'm in Tampa, Florida.
R:  Yeah.  I'm in Florida. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, I don't understand exactly what they're gonna do with this information or how they're gonna use it but uh ... I do plan on finding out.  I'm gonna get on the website.  I asked them if there's information there that explains it and he said there is.
L:  I mean, I got a customer service number.
R:  Yeah, I got that too.  I also got a website though but I ... I don't know.  Maybe you could call them up and find out too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].  Um [COUGH].  Yeah, I was actually just getting -- just starting my lunch when they called.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ... [MN] --
L:  I thought I was gonna be talking to, like, one of their psychiatrists or something, a student.
R:  No.  I don't think so.  I think that they just -- they just randomly pick us then they connect us --
L:  Oh, that's fine, it doesn't bother me.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, although they do listen to our conversations, I think, afterwards.  They record 'em and analyze 'em somehow.
L:  Oh, whatever.  As long as it's not phone sex!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]  No, I'd like to know what they're doing, though, with the information.
L:  Oh, it doesn't matter, as long as they send me my cheque!
R:  [LAUGH] [COUGH]  Maybe they're monitoring to see how uncomfortable people become and how they ... how they uh ... whether they talk or not [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, they're probably monitoring you more than they're monitoring me 'cause I've got the gift of gab.  I can talk all day long on the phone.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Say something, then [LAUGH].
L:  I have been talking.  I've been asking you a lot of questions.
R:  Yeah, I -- I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm kidding [COUGH].  Yeah, I don't know.  I can talk a lot sometimes but uh --
L:  I just don't know if they want us to talk about the million dollars or not?
R:  Well, I think they did but they're probably monitoring how our conversation has ... 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, ended up not being about that.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ...
R:  But uh ... yeah, I think if I could talk -- if I could just write to my friends ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  If I had a best friend ... because that's the first thing I thought when they said that.  It didn't sound specific.  It said -- I think they -- I think they said "Talk".
L:  Oh, well.  We're talking --
R:  But --
L:  I can't go right now because I'm on the phone and doing a research study.  [NOISE].  Give me ten minutes.  I should be off, right?  It's ten minutes calls, right?
R:  Yeah.  It's already been about ...
L:  Five.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] They're paying for the calls [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  You -- you -- you know what?  You want to talk to him or ... you're not registered [several inaudible words] [NOISE].  Well, you're gonna have to wait, shit.  [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I think it's been --
L:  I'm not gonna cancel it because this is income [NOISE].  Oh, jesus --
R:  I think it's been more than five minutes, so ...
L:  I know but they say we're not allowed to hang up.  [NOISE].
R:  No, they'll tell us when to hang up.
L:  [NOISE] No, dickhead.  [NOISE] You idiot.  It's not a PR thing.  I'm being researched because you're mentally retarded.  [LAUGH]
R:  But uh ... yeah, I was boiling some eggs and uh ... I was timing it, actually, right when they called, so it's been more than five minutes.
L:  Right.
R:  But anyways ... yeah, if I had a best friend, I couldn't talk to him but I could write to him and they'd give me a million dollars, I would.  Actually, I would definitely do it --
L:  Just turn off that VCR.  Mhm.
R:  If I could write to 'em.  If I couldn't write to 'em and I had a best friend, would they give me a million dollars.
L:  Yeah, if they gave me a million dollars, I wouldn't want any friends anyway and if I had a best friend --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I got the million dollars, I wouldn't care about the best friend any more because I probably would be, like, in shock over the million dollars and spending it and not having time for friends anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  For all the things that I never could afford, I would do it and then I'd probably give some away to, like, really needy people.
R:  Yeah, well, at least you're honest.
L:  That's the honest truth because friends come a dime a dozen [NOISE] [LAUGH].
R:  But uh ... yeah ...
L: Wait.  I'm getting paid for this phone call [NOISE].
R:  I don't know.  I know a few people who uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who are irreplaceable and who uh ... if I couldn't communicate with, I probably might decline.  Communicate, that is, either through writing or speaking.
L:  I can't hang up the phone.
R:  Or in any other way.
L:  I got, like, four more minutes before it'll disconnect the call.  [NOISE] It's not.  I'm talking to somebody while you're being very rude.  [NOISE] Yes.  Would you like to talk to the person?  [NOISE] We have to wait.  [NOISE] Do you see?  This is why I don't like this shit.
R:  How do I know, you're not part of the research?  You're --
L:  I am not part of the research [LAUGH].
R:  You're at the -- you're at the university, aren't ya?
L:  No, I'm not.  You know what?  I just registered this -- well, I called the number and --
R:  I just did too, a few minutes ago.  That's wh- --
L:  I called the number yesterday and they -- I left a recording with my phone number and a female contacted me today with my information.
R:  Yes.
L:  And then, all of a sudden, like, about two hours later, I got a phone call.  I didn't think it was gonna happen really fast.  You know, they say, just ten dollars per call, you know, and they ask, what's the best time to call and I said, any time during the day, I guess, you know and she said the calls were about ten minutes but you can't hang up.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's almost over.  Please don't hang up.  I want to get my check!  [LAUGH].
L:  No, I'm not gonna hang up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Disconnect the damn VCR.  [NOISE] Do you hear this?  This is a Tampa resident [NOISE].  Always complaining, I don't have any money and then when I'm making money, you're a big, you know [NOISE] ass about it.  You're not married, are you?  Hello?
R:  Yeah?
L:  Are you married?
R:  Uh ... no.
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  Don't ...
