R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Julie Weller.
L:  Hi, Julie.  Oh, I'm Ellen.
R:  Hi, Ellen, where are you from?
L:  Oh, I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in, um, Lincoln, Nebraska.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm from Hawaii.  I just moved here.
R:  Oh, exciting.
L:  [COUGH]] Let's see.  So, we're supposed to talk about time travel, but I mean --
R:  Actually, mine said, um ...
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- if you could go back and change something -- a decision that you'd made --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- what would you do?  Maybe we each have a different topic.
L:  Oh.  No, that's right.  I would say, while it's fresh in my mind because I mentioned it to somebody today actually that, um, I would have demanded to my parents that they not make me give my dog to the pound.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  And were you young when i- -- that happened?  Or, how old were you?
L:  Well, I was much younger than I am now.  I was -- I was, um, in my twenties --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I had gone to visit them and had gotten a ride and taken my big, beautiful, black lab with me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [SIGH] I had to go back to work and I was planning to get a ride with the same person and they cancelled.  And my parents being very, um, set in their ways were like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they wouldn't take care of my dog.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they made me -- it was a horrible experience.
R:  Oh.
L:  They made me take her to the pound!
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  And I was like -- 
R:  -- terrible!
L:  -- it was, like, I was back to -- ah, when I was eight years old and they used to really force me to do terrible things, and --
R:  Right, oh!
L:  So [COUGH] I was just saying that, you know, if I could -- why didn't I have enough sense to, like, go to some of the neighbors --
R:  Do it.  Oh.
L:  -- and say, "Could you just take my dog for me until I can come back --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- when I have a day off in two days" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and rescue my own dog.
R:  Oh.
L:  Whereas my parents took the dog as prisoner and myself as prisoner and I let them get away with it.
R:  So, now, um ...
L:  And this is years ago.
R:  -- could you have gone back to get the dog at the pound or not?
L:  No.  Because I was in another town and when I called back nobody would, um -- they said it was too late.
R:  Oh, no!
L:  Yeah.  So, it was kinda terrible and so --
R:  That does sound terrible.
L:  It was pretty -- yeah, so I -- 
R:  Pretty traumatic.
L:  -- just happened to mention that today.  What is yours?
R:  I think, I don't know -- I think I would say, um, go out of state for college.  When I was in -- when I, um, went to college I stayed in the same city that I grew up in and, um, so I still had a lot of the same friends --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I think maybe I would have, um --
L:  Gone for it.
R:  -- ventured out a little bit more and -- 
L:  A- -- uh-huh.
R:  -- and gone elsewhere to gain some different experience.  That type of thing, so --
L:  Yeah.  I know a lot of people in Hawaii say that they, you know, they're -- they're even tired of just being on the same island and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- that they feel like, "Oh, my God, I've never seen the world" --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and they've been all over the place --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know they really have.  Some of them have gone to Japan and Korea.  But, they're, like, "I haven't been to the mainland --"
R:  Oh.
L:  "-- I want to go to -- you know, Pennsylvania --" 
R:  Right.
L:  "-- or New York" --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- or, you know, they really don't have that experience of the mainland, because that's what we call it from Hawaii -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and that may be why I'm even in Florida now because, after eleven years of hearing that -- that, um -- 
R:  You decided you better go, huh?
L:  -- I -- I better -- well, I've, you know, I had been there for eleven years, and --
R:  So, you didn't grow up there?  You just --
L:  No.  I didn't grow up there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I had grown up in Wisconsin.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Then I lived in California for eleven years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, um ... [LIPSMACK] you know, it was because of a job thing too that I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- came here.  So ...
R:  Wow.
L:  So, you're still in Nebraska?
R:  Yeh, we h- -- I did end up moving around after --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- college and after I got married --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, for about six years we went to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, North Dakota [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- and then we --
L:  That's real far away.
R:  Mm, yeah, two states away.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then we went to Illinois for a while, and then we went to Olympia, Washington.
L:  Oh, that must have been neat.
R:  So, yeah, we were there not quite two years.  And then we had a chance to come back here.  We've got kids that are young.
L:  You just -- you've come back to the stability of Nebraska.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, our families are here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and our kids are very young -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, one and three so --
L:  Oh, yeah, well --
R:  -- just for them to be by their grandparents.
L:  Yeah, exactly it's --
R:  It's -- it's much better --
L:  Pardon?
R:  So [NOISE] my two year old's coming in right now.  Just a minute.  [NOISE] So --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  Oh I can't barel- -- I can barely hear you.
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can barely hear you.
L:  Oh [several inaudible words] 
R:  You're fading out.  I don't even -- I don't think I can hear you anymore.
L:  [several inaudible words] can't even hear me [several inaudible words] 
R:  Oh.  [SIGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words] going on with the [several inaudible words] 
R:  Are you there?  Are you there?
L:  [several inaudible words]  are you on a set time?
R:  There --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  No, I'm not.  Are you?
L:  Oh.  No.
R:  Huh, I don't know what -- now I can hear you.  Have you done one of these calls before?
L:  [COUGH] No, this is the first one.
R:  Yeah, this is my first one too.
L:  Yes, I've been watching the TV --
R:  Oh, I can barely hear you.
L:  -- o- -- um.  It's because this thing is cutting in and out.  It's cutting in and out.  Can you still hear me?
R:  I can hear you now, yeah.
L:  Okay.  [several inaudible words]
R:  Oh.  Now, I can't.  Can you hear me?  I can't hear anything right now.
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's yeah -- see, there's something -- it's like waving and, you know -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- so, I don't know, I mean, what do we do now?  Oh, wait -- 
R:  I --
L:  -- she said you have to stay on for ten minutes.
R:  How long has it been?  Do you know?
L:  God, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Did -- you see, I forgot to do that, when you called.  I have no idea.  She said otherwise it doesn't count.  We'd better talk another five minutes to make sure!
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I mean, how much do we get paid for this?  Do you know?
R:  I think ten dollars for each call.
L:  Oh, well, that would be okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I could just kinda --
R:  What the heck.
L:  -- add it up.  What -- what the heck, you know.
R:  I think you can do three calls, maybe --
L:  [MN]
R:  Each person in your family can do three.
L:  Oh, well, I don't have anybody else here, so --
R:  You can do three.  That's -- that's alright.  So, um, where did you live in Hawaii?
L:  Um, well, I lived mostly on Oahu.  In Oahu on [LAUGH] -- which -- wait a minute.  What island is that?  It's Oahu.  But I lived in Honolulu.
R:  You lived where?
L:  Honolulu.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, which is near Waikiki.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  I'm sorry, I cut out there.
L:  One year lived on Maui.
R:  Oh did ya?
L:  Yeah, in ninety three.  And that was really neat.  And, of course, I would always travel off island and inter-island.
R:  Oh.
L:  I like the big island a lot.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Kunai was a little slow for me.
R:  Was it?
L:  Have you been?
R:  I -- I've only been to Oahu.  My husband, um, traveled therefore work some, and I got to go once --
L:  Oh, really.  Well, well.
R:  -- so, I've only been there -- and we went last year about, ah, May.  So -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's when we were there.  But, I -- I would love to go back and go to Maui and some of the other islands.  But ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's neat, you know, just to, um, get to Oahu too 'cause it's so beautiful like --
R:  It is.
L:  -- you know, when you fly in and you just --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I miss that turquoise water.  Like here I thought the gulf would be --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- really similar.  But, it's not turquoise -- 
R:  It's not.
L:  -- it's green.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like pea green.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  And, um, and you know, I mean, I drove over at Christmas time to see what it was like on the Atlantic coast --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I've been before in past years and, I mean, it was ocean and it did smell more like what I'm used to, you know -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- with the real ocean --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- instead of gulf.  I mean, there was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a difference there --
R:  Oh.  That's interesting.
L:  -- but then, it was cold and, you know, I was like thinking -- I mean, it's really rough ocean, and I'm like the only person who would be swimming and the life guard isn't paying attention and -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I mean, my ex-boyfriend kept telling me about all these sharks and stuff.
R:  Oh, wonderful. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I was like, "Well, gee, I don't feel" --
R:  Forget it.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- w- like I'm, yeah.  I mean, you know --
R:  Not worth it.
L:  -- I'm not getting as much swimming happiness.  Let's put it that way.  I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kinda miss -- you know, I could swim with sea turtles --
R:  Oh, did you spend a lot of time doing that kind of thing?
L:  -- in Hawaii.  Oh, yeah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm totally the big swimmer.  And then, like, I mean, Maui you could be under water during whale season and hear the whales singing.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  How neat.
L:  And -- and I mean, you know, I mean, that's pretty rare -- 
R:  That is.
L:  -- and it's pretty cool and I miss all of it a lot.  But, I'm really happy that I came.  I wanted to see another type of climate and Florida seemed so mysterious 'cause ... I guess maybe articles that I've read, you know, even 'cause I teach and so -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in -- when I do the weekly reader and they're talking about the Everglades, and you're like, "Oh, my God".  You know, they have these alligators and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and there's moss hanging off the trees -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- see in Hawaii we don't have thunder storms and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  T- -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- like tonight here they had this huge thunder storm with lightening and it --
R:  So, you were not used to that anymore.
L:  -- it was neat.  Oh, it was so cool.  I loved it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was just really exciting to me.  Because, I mean, I don't remember that since, you know, my childhood.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  It probably doesn't even --
L:  Right.
R:  -- really rain much in -- in Hawaii, does it?
L:  Oh no, it definitely will come down.
R:  It will.
L:  So, we can have our water and, in fact, Kunai is the rainy -- the, you know, tips of the mountains, and Kunai is the rainiest pl- -- place on the planet.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh yeah, because we've got to have our water --
R:  True. 
L:  -- otherwise it wouldn't be so green.
R:  That's true.
L:  But, we don't have the humidity --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and trade winds blow away all the moisture --
R:  That is what makes it so great.  Right.  That's what makes it so great.
L:  -- so you're not sweating to death, and Florida is, like, so humid.
R:  Yes.  Even -- believe it or not, even in Nebraska it's extremely humid in the summer.  It's --
L:  Really?
R:  -- unbearable.  It's very hot and very humid.  So -- we were in Washington for a couple of years and --
L:  How was that?  Real rainy?
R:  -- i- -- it's very -- yes, in the win-
