R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Uh ... my name is Alexis and uh, obviously, you're at the University of Pennsylvania?
L:  What -- what was your name again?  I didn't catch it.
R:  Alexis.
L:  Alexis, okay.  My name is Nina and uh ... I'm twenty eight and out of school. 
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  So ...
R:  So ...
L:  Have you done one of these before?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Okay.
R:  Have -- have you?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, [LAUGH] would we not talk to our best friend for a million dollars?
R:  Um, I don't want to be technical but, like, I guess we could um ... if I could still write to the person [LAUGH], it might be okay.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know, but --
L:  Probably couldn't, though.
R:  Yes.
L:  I don't -- I don't think I would.
R:  No?  If -- if it means, like, no contact whatsoever, then ... then I don't think so.
L:  [NOISE]  I think, maybe I would ask the person first.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like say, "Look, there's a million dollars" ... but I don't know, even so, I'm not sure.
R:  Mhm.  It would have to be if um, maybe it has to be best, you know.  Both of us are still young so in the future, you know [MN] so, you know, get a million dollars in a different way.
L:  Yeah, I guess after you spend the million dollars, it wouldn't matter. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause then, like, what would you um ... you wouldn't have anyone to, like, you know, like, share it with, like, but if you can't see your best friend, like, who're you gonna call besides your parents, you know, like, "I got a million dollars [several inaudible words]" but uh, wow, we are supposed to talk for ten minutes about this.  [COUGH].  Excuse me.
L:  Do -- do you have a close friend, like, right now?
R:  [COUGH].  Excuse me?
L:  Do you have a close friend or a best friend that you go to school with now?
R:  Um, yes, uh, she doesn't go to school with me but I do have a r- -- like, a really good friend but uh, I already don't see that often but -- so, if it meant, you know, not seeing her at all, in a way, it wouldn't be that difficult but it would just be too much [inaudible] and when I do see her, it's, you know, like, ecstatic, 'cause we have a great time, even though we don't see each other that often.  Maybe like, once a year or every -- that's like, once a year is a lot.  You know, normally it's like, every two years or something.
L:  Oh.  [NOISE]
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Uh, yeah.  She's far away.  She's in ... well, not far.  She's in Virginia, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  And I don't -- I don't see her -- probably once a year too so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I wouldn't -- I don't know.  I don't think I'd take a million dollars to never talk to her again.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I don't think so [several inaudible words].  'Cause um it's hard to find good friends [LAUGH] as um ... when did you meet um, your friend?
L:  [NOISE].  I'm twenty eight, um, and I've known her since sixth grade, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's a lot to [inaudible].  Like, I'm only twenty three but I met my best friend when I was about twelve years old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] [COUGH].  So, yes ... we know each other pretty well and it's, you know, we're already older so it's hard to, like, recreate something like that, you know?  To find someone else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can't replace the person anyway.
L:  Nope.
R:  [MN].  Well, otherwise, um, uh, [MN] ... what would you um, I don't know, what would you do for a million dollars, if you could kind of switch it around like that?
L:  [MN]
R:  Like, something that maybe other people wouldn't do?
L:  I don't know, like, whatever it was, it -- whatever it would be, it wouldn't involve hurting anybody else.
R:  Right.
L:  Not hurting somebody's feelings or cutting them out of my life.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's right.
L:  I don't know.  There's very little I would do, probably.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I know.  I guess I ... 'cause I mean ... and money's not everything.  I'd -- money won't make you happy, so ...
L:  I know.
R:  No point in doing things that you know will make you unhappy, just for money, 'cause money is not going to do it for you.  Mm mm mm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that your phone, my phone or is that just the thing recording?  Do you hear, like, what I --
L:  I think that's the thing, it never sounds clear.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I mean, they called before and tried --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, like, connect me with other people and it's never worked.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So ... this is the first time it's worked.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they've called me before.  I think this is the fourth time they called tonight and I just kept going and getting my pin number wrong.  I was so frustrated.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  "What's my pin number, I can't remember it" so they finally called me back so this is actually the first attempt that I've had to connect and it's working out all right, so ...
L:  What do you study at Penn?
R:  Um, I'm at Warton[?] so I'm in the management program.
L:  Oh.
R:  And um, [COUGH] right now, I'm not taking any courses.  I'm finishing up a thesis paper, looking for jobs.
L:  Well, good luck.
R:  Thanks.  What do you do?
L:  I'm a systems administrator.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, how did you find out about this?
L:  Um, part o- -- I signed up with this secret shopper thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I got an email.
R:  Oh.
L:  That they were going to be doing these phone studies, so I signed up for it.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It seems like um ... interesting.  I'm not exactly sure where they're going with this [inaudible].  I don't -- speech patterns or ... I don't know what they're gonna ... How do --
L:  Oh, okay.  So, you found out through a -- through the campus?
R:  Yeah.  I got an email --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on, like uh ... I guess, in one of the groups I belong to or whatever they put the notes [inaudible] and they sent the n- -- email to th- -- to that list [COUGH] so um, that's how I found out about it and signed up, so ...
L:  Well, good luck in your career.
R:  Thanks.  [COUGH].  I'm so ... not looking forward to it!  [COUGH] [LAUGH].
L:  Why, you don't like --
R:  -- I wish I could be more --
L:  -- you don't like to --
R:  -- I just --
L:  -- you don't like these studies or something?
R:  No.  I like school.  I like studying.  I -- I don't want to be in the real world quite yet.
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, you don't have a choice, I don't think.
R:  I know, like, um, maybe I could [several inaudible words]
L:  Well ...
R:  Be a student for the rest of my life.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But no ... although, I really do like the academic studies, so in the future I would like to be a [inaudible] teacher in high school or college.
L:  Okay.
R:  So ... so, what does a systems administrator do?  Do you take care of, like, the computers and stuff?
L:  Right.  Computers are --
R:  This is at Pan Alto?
L:  Mm?
R:  Do you -- do you work at -- you don't work at Penn, so you --
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  Okay.  [COUGH].  Ooh ... well ... let's see ...
L:  I don't know how long they want us to talk.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't --
L:  I think we've pretty much got our point across.  I wouldn't do it --
R:  I know.
L:  You wouldn't do it.
R:  [MN] [MN]  I just wouldn't.  I guess it's really short when you both agree, like ... oh, okay, no.  All right.  [LAUGH].  We would not take the money.  [MN]  So ... 
L:  Okay.  Well, Alexis, good luck with your career and your studies.
R:  Mhm.  Do you know um, how long we've been speaking on the phone?  I don't know if you'd had, like, a ...
L:  No, I think that we --
R:  When -- when they called me, they told me that, you know, like, that little [inaudible] or whatever will come back on and say, "Okay, well done".
L:  Oh.
R:  But um ... and it was, like, supposed to be ten minutes but I don't know, like, if we cut it short, if it would still work.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But um ... who is that little -- little one I hear in the background?
L:  Mhm, he's two.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have a godson.  He's gonna ... he just turned two, actually, yesterday [several inaudible words] and uh ...
L:  Is he in Philly?
R:  Yeah.  So ... I'm his godmother [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] [MN].  He's a ... he's a little cute thing.  Um, let me see ... do, do, do ...
L:  [LAUGH].  Maybe this is part of the study.  Once the topic's done, what are they gonna talk about?
R:  Oh.  [several inaudible words].  It could be.  You mean, like, a behavior ...
