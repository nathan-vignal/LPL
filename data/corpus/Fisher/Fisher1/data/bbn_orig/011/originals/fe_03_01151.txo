R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Mike.
R:  Oh, I'm Laurie.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  Good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's kind of a weird question though.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I was thinking it was going to be something real controversial or something  like that -- 
L:  Yeah, I just -- I -- I just, ah, found this on -- on the internet last night but, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] It's definitely a weird question though.  I mean -- 
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Because it's not possible, but [LAUGH] it'd be decent if it was.
R:  Yeah, well that's funny because, um, lately I've kind of had all this, um, upheaval.  I'm forty three so it's like I'm going through this, looking back and, you know, regrets and how I might have done more personal things different.  But, I think, you know, right off the top of my head, I think the first thing I thought of was that, you know -- I went to college right after highschool, I didn't have a clue of what I wanted to do, and I hadn't had any life experience.  I mean, I considered, you know, it -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was like a prison to be in school as long as I had.  So, I wish that I had travelled.  You know, gone to Europe, gone all over the place and seen different cultures and really experienced life --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and known a little bit more before I went in for four more years, you [LAUGH] -- so that would be probably my answer on that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'm thirty.  I kinda had the same problem.  I, ah -- 
R:  Oh right.
L:  -- I mean, I own a business now and everything in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Indiana -- 
R:  Really.
L:  -- but, ah, I'm one of the youngest business owners around but -- ar- around here -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I opened when I was twenty three.
R:  Wow.
L:  When I got out of college.  But, there's a lot of things I'd change if I could go back in time.  I mean, there's a lot of things I would've -- did differently.  It would have been a lot easier to get, you know, everything going the way it is now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there's a lot of different ways, you know, I could've went around a lot of stuff.  But, I did the same thing.  Went to college and took four year- I didn't go back for four more but [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but, ah, I went into hotel restaurant management --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and food service sanitation.  And there was a lot of different things, like I say, that I wish I would have done that I'd like to go back and do.  But, like I said, it's basically -- it'd be impossible to do it --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unless they invent something soon.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which I don't see it happening but --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's -- I know, it's tough because, you know, you -- you don't always have the opportunity once -- I mean, you get presented with something, um, you know, when you're young, and you don't always get the chance to change that or sometimes you know -- well, for me and my parents financed most of it.  So, you have that feeling that if you don't take advantage of it at that point, you might not be able to get it again [LAUGH] so that's -- when you look back at the reasons and the choices you made, there was always that something was pressuring or whatever --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so it's -- it isn't always as, um, logical especially at that age that -- than it is years' later.  So, I don't know.  Maybe, um, I mean, maybe not everything you did -- you -- if you did have a chance to go back it would be even as good as it turned out now.  So, it's hard to say.
L:  Yeah.  It is definitely hard to say.  Like I said, my -- my parents were divorced when I was young.
R:  Really.
L:  And so when I was twelve years old I started mowing grass.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I was making four hundred dollars a week by the time I was thirteen.
R:  Wow.
L:  And so I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- just kept all the money in the bank and paid for my own college and everything and then, ah, like I said I bought my own restaurant.  And now I have two restaurants, a seventeen unit motel and I'm getting ready to open a dollar store --
R:  Wow --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- that's great.
L:  -- but, ah, it is definitely different.  So, really if I c- even if I could go back in time I don't know -- I mean, a- I would have liked -- if I could go back in time I'd like to have changed it and made it a lot easier than it was when I was younger.  But -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then you got to look to it.  Like I said, what I have now versus then, I mean, if I would have had it real easy I may have got lazy and not had what I have today either.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- that's a possibility, yeah.
L:  That would have made a big difference --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, yeah it's good that you were able to, um, you know, pay for a lot of that yourself because I think not having that on me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- made me drift.  I really didn't know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- what to do in college and I just -- I thought, "Well, this is pretty good, you know, my dad's paying for this".  And that's not -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a good thing.  I think -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's better if you really have -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the -- you know, you're in control.  So, I wish that maybe he had actually just lied and said, "Well, you know, I don't really have that much, you know, to give you" and then I would have really --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- focused in on what I wanted to do -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- 'cause --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I've often thought I should've been an entrepreneur, you know, like you 'cause I -- I ended up majoring in psychology and it has taken me on just the most ridiculous, floundering journey.  So, that was -- that was definitely --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a mistake in -- in what I ended up doing because it hasn't been -- I haven't been able to use it to the point where, you know, it's a professional career -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or you -- 'cause you have to go on and get your --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- masters to do anything with it.  So -- 
L:  Well, you still could though.
R:  Yeah, I could if I was motivated.  And that's the thing.  Not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- too many people -- you hear about it.  At forty three they go back -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- some get their --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- PhD.  But, it's -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really hard.  It's something about getting out of that, um, mode of, um, you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- know, going to school every day and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that kind of thing.  But, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, aside from that, I think, ah, if I could go back and do it all again I might have [SIGH] -- I might have treated my personal relationships different too.  I ended up, um, getting married and getting divorced in, like, six years.  No children, which was good.  But, I, you know, think my choices of people were really bad too --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- when I w- [LAUGH] that's another thing, you know, how easy it is now to look back and say, "Boy, I should have not have done some of the stuff I did".  You know, just -- I was callous with certain people --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that I just thought, you know, w- I just couldn't figure them out.  And now I look back and I think they were just very shy people and I just treated it like, you know, I just didn't have the patience for these guys.  And so that's a deep regret because -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I don't even know where they are and they seem like they would have been good people.  Instead I chose somebody who -- who was this -- I mean, he wasn't a bad person.  But, he just didn't meet my emotional needs very well.  So, that was a big mistake too.  So, you know, now I'm alone and it's kind of sad.  If I could do it over again I would've wished I read books or learned more about how to -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, to judge people's character better, and this kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I, ah, I just got married last year.
R:  Oh.
L:  And if I could go back in time I would have changed that and made it a lot sooner.
R:  Really.
L:  Because I've been through, you know, the different girls and all this good stuff and I, you know, I -- I just had to be the person that was the football player in, you know, in highschool and the football player in college and all this good stuff.  And I met a girl when I was fifteen years old -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- that I was dating and then, ah, she'd moved away and I hadn't seen her in fifteen years.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then, ah, last year I got a phone call at my restaurant.  Someone wanting to know if it was me that owned it.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I married her.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow, that is -- 
L:  It was the same --
R:  -- so cute.
L:  -- girl that I had known -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- when we were fifteen years old.
R:  Wow.
L:  And she had -- she had seen Mike's Family Restaurant, and she said, "You always said you were going to do it and the --" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- only person who I could think of around here that would have a re- have a restaurant named -- you know, Mike's Family Restaurant" and she said, "I knew it had to be you".
R:  Wow.
L:  And so -- 
R:  That's great.
L:  -- after fifteen years -- like I said, if I could go back in time I would've -- I would've changed that, you know, a long time before now but, ah, we have, ah -- looks like we have three little kids and I've got a -- I've got a five month old son now.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, ah, but like I said -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I would've -- it would've changed that a lot, you know, a lot sooner -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if I coulda went back in time and did it.  But -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, at the time I wasn't thinking about it, you know.  I was fifteen -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's the way it works, but, ah -- 
R:  That's a great story, but you know what?  You might not have had the appreciation of her -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- so you were, yeah, older to have realised what you almost lost.  So, that's good.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that made a big difference.  But, like I said -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it --
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- definitely, you know, it's definitely not easy.  I mean, I can make a lot of things easy, namely if I could go back in time -- if I could go back to, like nineteen fifty -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the things I know now --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and -- and -- and all the -- you know, all the new innovations of today --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I could be Bill Gates.  You could be anybody you wanted to be with the stuff -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know today.  I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you could be the richest person in the fifties.
R:  Right.
L:  If you could, you know, just -- the simple things.  I mean, like, you know, I mean, satellite TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, cordless phones.
R:  Right.
L:  Or computers.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You -- you could be -- you could be anybody you wanted to be with just the knowledge of what's going on today.
R:  Right.
L:  That'd be a -- that'd -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- be a big difference.
R:  Yeah, that would be.  That -- that -- 
L:  I mean, yeah, I'd -- 
R:  -- would be.
L:  -- like to have two hundred million dollars like Bill Gates or -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- five hundred million.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, I -- and I don't know if I would or not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, I mean, actually with that, you know, you pay a price for that too.  You can't -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go anywhere, you can't do anything.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  But, ah, that's a problem because y- like the rock stars.  You go out and get mobbed and, you know, they can't go anywhere, can't do anything because they're so famous.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and they're --
L:  Can't -- 
R:  -- but -- 
L:  -- take their kids out and do anything or -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, ah -- 
R:  And it's always that security, you know, that -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that you're worried that somebody's stalking you or whatever.  So, yeah -- 
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- it's a -- 
L:  -- constantly having to have body guards and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, security systems on everything and -- 
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, that -- that would get a little bit -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's a lot of stuff you could do.  I mean, like I said, if you could go back -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, year's -- like I said, if you could go back fifty years -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with everything we know now, you could -- you could be -- like I said, you could be anything you wanted to be. 
R:  Yeah, it's amazing how -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that would --
