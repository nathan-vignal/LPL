L:  [MN]
R:  My name is Laura Hawkins and if I could go back in time and change something that I have done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would not have graduated high school early, I would have went four years instead of three, I would have went straight onto college afterwards and my whole life path would have changed after that.
L:  [LAUGH].  Hi Laura.  My name is Chris Kelsey[?].  Um, I think I have a similar life path.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If -- if I could go back and change it, um, I did -- I did three, three and a half years of high school, but what I would have done was done a little more time, got the math and not dodged math --
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  -- the rest of my academic career [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That was -- so it's not that dissimilar [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I was really heavy into the sciences and math -- math I barely made it through.  It wasn't until I got to college in my twenties, when I took my -- my path off the road and went back to school, that I understood algebra --
L:  Magic.
R:  -- oh, my god, it makes sense now [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, in that case, after this call you'll have to send me the notes because I went [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I w- -- I went through, um, when I was in -- in high school I took advanced placement courses --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I did what was supposed to be, oh, you know, four years of high school math in a year and a summer --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and since I had fulfilled the requirements, I quit.  I started throwing pots and making jewelry in the art department [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Then I did my undergraduate work in journalism, it required no math --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then last year at the age of not quite fifty I went back to school for a masters in computer science and had to take my first math class since then.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, it -- it, um, [LIPSMACK] it was difficult [LAUGH].
R:  Well, actually what got me through when, um, I went back to the school and then I wasn't really sure if that's what I really wanted to do and at that time you could collect social security until you were like twenty two years old so it was like, I was just like looking for a free ride --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- I didn't take anything real seriously, um --
L:  The -- the glories of youth.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, after having children and preaching education since they were babies, I went back to school and let me tell you, I'm so glad my kids are smart --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they helped me get past my algebra --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, you know, my geometry and I'm -- I'm actually just two classes short of my degree --
L:  Congrats.
R:  Thank you.  However, you know, I've had cancer a few times over the years --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and that kind of set me back.  Right now I'm taking a break and I plan on enrolling in the fall --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- get those two classes out of the way with, but, oh, yeah, my whole life would have been totally different had I just went that extra year, you know, I mean, I didn't have to go, I had all my credits, but it -- I could have had a lot more fun [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, and since you didn't, you --
R:  -- had --
L:  -- it wasn't like you pushed immediately into your undergrad.
R:  Right.  I could have taken a bit more classes for fun or more science because I really liked the sciences and just, you know, been the drone who went to school the four years and, you know, instead of going off to Europe and doing just those things.  I mean, I don't really regret my travels because, you know, with kids now travel, what's that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- packing them up in the car and having -- pulling your hair out, you know --
L:  Yeah.  See, I pushed through and what I -- I wish I had done, apart from, you know, knowing now that I should like math and it sort of stands between me and all the things that interest me today --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I also wish that since -- since like you I was done early --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I wish I had been more adamant and -- and left -- I -- I did a half a senior year, for half a day and worked the rest of the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I should have been adamant to leave at the end of my junior year and tried to do that traveling because, um, it -- it never happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- and I wish I, you know, had done that.
R:  But, you know, I also -- this is a really tough question, because my initial thought, oh, I wouldn't have married my husband [LAUGH] --
L:  If your husband was like my husband, that would be a good thing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I married and then divorced mine!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] However, you know, that gave me my children which I wouldn't give up for anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  It's like, the -- the choices we make and the paths we take change us forever and we be- -- we become who we are because of those choices.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  And personally, you know, I kind of like myself [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah and --
R:  And, you know, I'm funny, I'm patient, I'm tolerant, I'm non judgmental, I can be thrown in a room with a hundred different people not know anybody and leave knowing ninety eight.
L:  Yes.  I'm exactly the same way and -- and that part I w- -- I'm not quite sure how I got that way, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.
R:  No.
L:  Because I think we're ahead of, you know, a whole bunch of people who get up in the morning and don't like who they're living with [SIGH] meaning themselves.
R:  Right.  Or what they see in the mirror and, yeah.  No, I mean, so that would -- really, education and -- and knowing what I know today, [MN] and doing -- and knowing it then instead of being young and stupid and +flippant about things --
L:  Yeah, but if you --
R:  -- okay --
L:  -- weren't young and stupid you wouldn't have done the travels and you wouldn't have the same perspective that you have because of that.
R:  It's true.
L:  You know.
R:  It's really true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And same with you, you know, I mean, but you know, that's when I try not ever to regret things I've done --
L:  Yeah [MN] --
R:  wrong, you know --
L:  It's the topic of the day, not an obsession [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  I mean, yeah, I regret when I, you know, get ticked off at a neighbor or something and, you know, or I'm like mean or when I don't mean to be sometimes I get -- I'm thinking of other things and I come across one way and I don't mean to, um, but I'm quick to apologize, too, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I re- -- those are the things I regret, the day to day things like oh, I'm sorry, I didn't acknowledge you, I had other things on my mind, I wasn't ignoring you, those are the things, because those are affecting -- those are -- with people I see every day and I care about most, m- -- you know, my family or my neighbors and, you -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my friends.  Those are the things I regret, you know, the big things, you know, [MN] everything we do in -- when you look at the vastness of everything, it's just so insignificant --
L:  Oh, and everything we do closes a door but then again it opens another one.
R:  Exactly.  You know --
L:  So, it's not -- it's sort of like a web.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  And the funny thing is, both of us are just sitting here saying, "Okay, my regret is educationally related" and the funny thing is, especially in this day and age, that's actually one of the few that we can go back and do something about.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Which is kind of cool.
R:  It's awesome.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Awesomely g- -- now, have you ever done any of these before?
L:  No.  You know, I -- I, um, signed up for the study when I first heard about it and they were like, you'll get a call within two weeks and that was, I don't know, it seems like a year ago --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And it's like, they said, "Enter your PIN number" I'm like, Oh, my god I got to go into my email --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I've got to pull it out of my passwords --
L:  That's exactly what I did, I went bolting for the box [LAUGH]--
R:  -- and I'm thinking, "Oh, no, I'm going to get disconnected, this is going to be timed" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I'm glad they're doing it, though.  Do you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how did you know about the study?  Or did you school at Penn or ...?
R:  Um, no, actually it was on the computer.  I'm a member of a message board that somebody had posted it --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and, you know, big big savings dot com.
L:  Don't know that one.
R:  And, um, somebody had mentioned it and I thought, "Oh, well that sounds cool, I'll check it out" and they, like you said, two weeks, okay, you know, they called me to give me the PIN, you'll get an email, I'm like, "Okay", ooh, this is cool.  And then, nothing [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought, okay, another dud.
L:  Yeah.  They didn't even call me.  I just, you know, the email, did the whole thing by email and they did say they'd make you give your social security number and being a privacy freak I just gave them a series of nines so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I never heard anything, I figured, okay, they're not going to use me, I didn't give them, you know, I didn't want to email my soc [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Well, you know what, because emails are not secure.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  A lot of people don't know that.  They think they are and having been a victim of somebody getting into my Citibank --
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  -- account and trying to send money overseas and --
L:  Oh, you really got whacked out, the whole --
R:  -- oh, yeah, this was -- you know, I get an email saying, the transfer of two thousand nine hundred --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm like, whoa, wait a minute --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know what this is about.
L:  To somewhere totally obscure.
R:  Oh, yeah, and I called them and I said, I don't know what this is about, I have no clue, I never authorized anything, "Well, somebody got your" well, how?  You have a secure site, it's on your end, it's not on my end.  Sorry.  [LAUGH] So, I've been battling with them.  Fortunately it's, you know, I just said, "Look, close everything I -- I'm done" so I don't do that over the Internet anymore either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No more socs or --
L:  Well, the socs is the absolute worst of it because that's the key to everything else.
R:  Yeah.  And it's not supposed to be.
L:  Yeah.  I've had -- I've had a credit card ripped once or twice, but the credit card companies are very good about, oh, never mind and they shut everything down and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the credit card doesn't really bother me to use on -- on the net.  And that's really no safer than, you know, using it by phone or whatever else.
R:  Well, I -- I do shopping over the Internet.
L:  Right.
R:  Because I find I can get some fabulous deals online that you can't get -- the -- the same store, Spencers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ninety six cent boxer shorts for my -- because I have four boys and then my husband --
L:  Yeah, that'll -- that'll send you looking for boxer sales [LAUGH].
R:  You know.  And then it's like at the Spencers store it's like wait a minute, you got seven forty nine
