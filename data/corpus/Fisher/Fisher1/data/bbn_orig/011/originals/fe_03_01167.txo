R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Lisa.
L:  Hi, this is Alicia.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Where are -- 
L:  How are you?
R:  -- you from?  [LAUGH]  Good, how are you?
L:  Oh, I'm good.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, Portland, Oregon.
R:  Oh, okay, I'm from, ah, the San Francisco area.
L:  Oh, funny.  Yeah -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I've been waiting forever for -- to get a call from the city.  So [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] I got one a half hour ago and I couldn't find my pin.  I had to -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, cool, this is the first one I've -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- gotten.
R:  This is the -- 
L:  [inaudible]  
R:  -- first one you said?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  So, the topic is if we could change -- go back in time and change something we'd done, what would it be?
R:  It is something we'd personally done or -- or, like in history w- I didn't catch that.
L:  We had done.
R:  Oh, dear.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  If you had changed the thing -- 
R:  Oh, boy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you had done, then what would it be?
R:  Well, I think I know what mine would be.
L:  Okay, tell me.
R:  I think I wouldn't have taken off my engagement ring and thrown in across the, um, the square in Venice [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- on my honeymoon.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh -- did -- did that end it?
R:  No.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. 
R:  I'm still married.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, oh, oh.  What -- 
R:  But, ah, it caused probably some little, you know, little -- you know how -- are you married?
L:  No, I'm not, I'm single -- 
R:  Okay, well it caused a little bit of, you know, those little [inaudible] permanent things that just don't go away.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, I know -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where did you have a fight.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yeah.  It was terrible.
L:  Oh, no and -- 
R:  He had my ring for like three weeks and wouldn't give it back to me.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  [LAUGH] His feelings were hurt.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, men, they're sensitive.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  They try not to be but they are.
R:  Well, we went on a three month honeymoon and so it -- it sounds really great except that it was -- it was really great except we were travelling so much and we were living out of our backpacks and it was, like, just very difficult in a way.
L:  Well, I think when you're with someone twenty four seven travelling like that it -- you get on each other's nerves.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  A little bit.
R:  That's kind of what happened.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You don't have much alone time.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's very true, and also different travelling styles.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I would have liked to just lie on the beach for three weeks.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then he wanted to just go do and see everything -- 
R:  Yeah, he wanted to see everything.  So -- 
L:  That's funny.
R:  How about you?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, um, yeah, mine's real similar, like, this is the one thing and, you know, I'm -- I'm usually the type of person that thinks everything happens for a reason, you know?
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  And who -- who never, you know, doesn't really ever want to change anything because it's the way it's supposed to be.  But, if I could, I mean, I'd ch- you know, if there was really a chance -- really could do time travel and there was really, like, this reality of really doing it, I probably would.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Park me down, let me get in the ship. 
R:  Oh, that'd be fun.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, and then I'd wear more sunscreen [LAUGH] --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- probably, n- yeah, work out more -- no I'm just kidding -- 
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- if I could go back I'd probably go back to prior nineteen nineties, no nineteen -- no two thousand -- two thousand, probably -- 
R:  Oh, not that far.
L:  The spring -- yeah, just like, three years ago last month and -- because I was seeing someone long distance, this guy that I met actually when I was backpacking in Mexico, um, I met an Australian guy and we had this kind of back and forth relationship and we travelled and then he -- I went to Australia and then he decided to come live with me.  But, we had to have three months apart because he had to save up the money -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to come over -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I was by myself.  And for some idiotic reason I decided to hang out with my ex-boyfriend one night -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it, like, [SIGH] why?  I don't know.  I just think I had some unresolved issues, you know, I didn't have full closure.  And I wasn't still going to live with my ex-boyfriend, but I -- I just thought, "Well, you know, it'd be good to go hang out and just get some full on closure before I, you know, Mark comes and, like, I never see my ex-boyfriend again".  You know, 'cause I know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's time to [inaudible] -- you know, you kind of have to put the end on things sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then something ended up happening.  [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  -- just because g- guess who drank two bottles of wine and had some mixed drinks -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and just got so loaded and then, like, something ended up kind of happening and just -- he was just kind of more aggressive with me and it was mainly -- I mean, I'm not -- I was just so loaded -- 
R:  But what was --
L:  I mean 
R:  -- what was this other -- the -- the Australian couldn't forgive you?  He didn't understand it, or what?
L:  Well, I didn't tell him for the longest time because, like, I blacked out.  I didn't even remember half of what happened -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, you know?  So, it was just like I couldn't even say for sure.  And it took me a long time to even really -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- piece it together and figure it out.  Like, I didn't remember getting from point A to point B.  How did we get home?  I thought I drove.  "No, I took the keys away from you".  "I don't remember that, I drove".  "No, you didn't" -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Wow, you were trashed.  [LAUGH]
L:  I was.  And so, I mean, I don't feel like it was really my -- totally my fault.  I mean, I was like so out of it.  But, there was some -- an indiscretion, you know, and I felt so horrible about it.  And I just got really bummed out and then, um, he could sense something was up.  Like, you know, people that know you really well -- you can't hide things, you can't keep secrets, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And he figured it out, and he figured something happened and I didn't even tell him, and he didn't even ask.  But, he just figured and, um, and then I told him nothing.  And I mean, I -- later I did admit something, but, he was just really hurt and he went up -- like, he ended up going back and -- well, he didn't go back because of that.  He went back because he couldn't get a green card.  But -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- any hollie [LAUGH] he ended up going home and then, you know, I -- later I told him and, like, yeah he's totally not a very forgiving person and -- and I mean, it really broke -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- his heart, even though, you know -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- sometimes these things happen and, you know, it really broke his heart and -- I mean, I always felt really bad about that and, you know -- 
R:  Did you ever talk to him again after that?
L:  Um -- 
R:  About it or anything?
L:  -- I mean, yeah, we tried to kind of work it out -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think he just couldn't let it go.  You know, and there were -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- some other issues and he got really passive aggressive after that.  He -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- changed and was -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- acting really angry all the time and -- and it just wasn't healthy anymore, you know, it just went down hill.  But, it all started because [LAUGH] I totally was, like, did not set up a really strong boundary with my ex-boyfriend.  I thought, "Oh, yeah, I can just go out and be friends and talk to him and it's be cool" and so, yeah, I mean, if there's one thing [LAUGH] I could go back and -- 
R:  Do you think -- ah, you think if you hadn't done that, that you would be like married happily ever after with this guy?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I can't say that.  But, ah, maybe not since, like, I mean, I guess if you were to think if it's meant to be we would have worked it out.  That's why -- 
R:  Well, al- also his reactions -- 
L:  -- that's why I say -- 
R:  -- kind of, you know, I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't know.  I'm forgiving.  Giv- given all the circumstances that led up -- led to it, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  He's -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- yeah.  That's one thing too.  He's, like, kind of --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- not a very forgiving person and that's one thing too that made me think well maybe we're not the right people, because I'm a really compassionate, forgiving person.  You have to be to live in this world -- 
R:  Yeah, well. 
L:  -- unless you want to suffer a lot.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  It's a good point -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Unless you want to be miserable.  [LAUGH] [COUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So it's like -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he was -- he's miserable a lot I think and, um -- but I mean, even if it wouldn't have worked out, that's okay, that's just something that -- 
R:  You just didn't want to hurt him.
L:  -- I felt really bad about hurting him -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I made -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I made a bad decision and I mean, I just wish I would have had the foresight.  You know, I wish I'd, like -- you know, I could have gone back, like, knowing that my ex-boyfriend was going to pull something on me, you know, when I was so inebriated.  You know, then I -- I could have known I could have not gone, you know?  But, sometimes -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [inaudible] I used to think, "God, I wish I could go back in time and have that foresight and just totally not go have a drink with him or six drinks" --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  So, that's mine.
R:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's bad.  That's my story there.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, then again, I mean -- 
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't know, then you -- then you kind of go, "Well, maybe the universe knows best and, you know, why these happen for a reason and something better come- will come along".  And then you'll be like, "Oh, my God, why would I -- was I ever with that bozo in the first place there".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, to go back and change it -- yeah, how does that change the future?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And does it take a future that you really want.
L:  Exactly -- 
R:  I mean, your -- in your case -- in your case.  I mean, in my case if I hadn't done that I would have been better.  I'm sure it would have made things better ultimately.  But -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- in your case, I mean, it's sort of unclear ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whether you would really -- you know, if you went back and fixed everything whether that would have changed things -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the better or not.  Do you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.  I know what you mean.  I mean, I guess we'll never know.  But -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's an interesting thing to think about.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my God.
L:  Like, how your life would be different.
R:  The funny -- 
L:  Would I be a different person?  Would I -- what -- what kind of person would I be?  Would I have learned, you know, the things I had learned and know what I know now and -- you know what I mean?
R:  Right.  Yeah -- 
L:  Bec-
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because we gr- it's like we grow from those experiences.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know -- 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- I might not have had that if I wouldn't have gone done that, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you know, maturity is part of growing up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm sure that's why everybody wants to go back and change something.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I think maybe if you can look at this question --
