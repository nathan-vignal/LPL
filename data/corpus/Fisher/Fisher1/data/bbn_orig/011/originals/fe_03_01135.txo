R:  Hey, I'm Eric.
L:  Hi Eric, I'm Dawn.
R:  Hey, how ya doing?
L:  Good.  Have you ever done this before?
R:  No, I've never done this before. 
L:  Okay -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- well, this is really interesting because this is my second time tonight and it was the same question last time.  So -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, ah --
L:  But, um.
R:  What?
L:  Ah, so, do you have any -- do you have anything that you would change?
R:  Well, um, let's see.  I guess I would've, um, probably done better at school and stayed at college sooner.
L:  Okay.
R:  That's probably what I would've changed.  I guess because -- but then, if I would have done that -- I started out as a early childhood major --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and now I'm a computer information systems major.  So, who knows I'll be teaching school in how to be a computer nerd.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it's interesting how the choices we make, you know -- just one little choice can make a big difference in your life.  You know?
R:  Yeah that's -- that's true.
L:  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  Last, um, um m- mine -- I wish that I had been more involved in school, in highschool.  That I had been more, you know, involved with the, like, year book and just being involved.  I -- I went to school, I did my work, and then I bailed.  You know, I would go and -- and go play.  Go -- go hang out with my friends, get into trouble, you know, just whatever.  But, I didn't want to be at school.  I didn't like school and now I look back and I think, I really missed out on a lot.  And I -- I think that's also leading to college it would have been really fun and it would have been a neat experience to, ah, like do the college thing 'cause I -- I went to a trade school. 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I wish I -- I w- wish I would've went away to college, 'cause, um, I went to a school in Georgia called Georgia State and, ah, when I first started there, you know, there was no on campus living or anything like that.  So, it was just like going downtown, going to school, and going home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it really wasn't like a real college experience.  So, I still would have done that.  That would have probably, ah, been more fun --
L:  Yeah, that would've been fun.  Yeah, I think that's -- that -- I would have to agree with that.  Me too.  I think I w- would've liked to have gone somewhere where it would've been a -- a new change, a challenge, new scene, you know.  But, um, now last time we did this we just sat here and we talked and we were waiting for the rec- you know, for something to prompt us to stop or whatever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And nothing did.  We pushed pound, nothing happened.  So, um, is there anything else -- 
R:  I don't --
L:  -- that -- that you would change that ...
R:  Well, let's see -- 
L:  If you could travel back in time.  I think that's what they're going for is if you could travel back in time what would you do differently?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, to travel back in time.  Well, I mean, I guess the only things I could change would be things [several inaudible words] had to study for, um, my -- my decision of what, ah -- I guess I would've -- I guess one thing I would've changed -- I guess I would've, um, maybe moved to a different city.
L:  Okay.
R:  When I had the opportunity -- when I had the opportunity, um ... I should have went back to New Orleans.  I stayed in Georgia.  I -- I think I'd rather --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have stayed in New Orleans earlier maybe I would've [inaudible].  You know, move back there.  But, you know -- 
L:  I'm having a hard -- I'm having a hard time hearing you.  Are you doing something or -- while you're talking to me?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.
R:  No, I'm just sitting.
L:  But, okay 'cause I'm hearing, like, rustling or something.  Then, ah -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- maybe it's on my end, I don't know.
R:  Oh, it might just --
L:  Okay, well, ah, Jeez, um, well, I think, you know, as you get older and you get more, ah, no -- I've -- I've gotten more self-secure, you know.  When -- when you're young you think you know it all but you really don't know anything and you really are pretty insecure.  You can be confident but you're -- you know, you just don't know anything.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Life -- life beats you up, you know?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I think if I were to go back I would probably make, um, [NOISE] ... I think that my choices that I would've made -- I mean, like I -- I think back and I think, "Gosh, you know, I really should've gone" um, you know I had -- at one point I had wanted to work on a cruise line.  Um, at one point I wanted to be a flight attendant, you know, 'cause I love to travel.  But, I think I probably would've chosen to do something, you know, at that young period in my life that, um, would've allowed me to travel more.
R:  [NOISE] You know, I really -- I guess I -- I guess I really would have.  I used to perform at highschool.  I -- I used to sing and, um, do drama and all that.  I really wish I would've stuck to that.  You know, that would have been cool and I would have been able to just, um, you know, perform 'cause I miss performing and I guess if there was one thing I really would go back and do, I would concentrate on my music more and I would've -- I would've put that in my mind.  I probably would be doing a lot of different -- different things than what I was back, if I was able to go back and just, like, you know, concentrate on my music.  That's what -- 
L:  So, what --
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  -- did you play an instrument or ...?
R:  I was learning how to play the piano.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I used to sing.  So --
L:  Okay.
R:  I guess that- that's what -- I guess that's one thing I really would change. 
L:  Well, really but [LAUGH].  Now, this is my second call.  It's funny I wasn't expecting to get, you know, another call and I certainly wasn't expecting to get asked the same question.  But, once you really start thinking about it -- I mean, you know, I love my life.  I -- you know, I do.  I have a great life.  I have great kids.  I have an incredible husband.  I'm able to stay home, I mean.  But, I just think back to, you know, now -- you know, I'm older and I'm -- I'm super responsible.  I have so many responsibilities now and it would have been nice for me to live a little bit more when I was young.  You know, to experiment some more.  You know, you know, to be more daring.  Like I said, you know, try a job or that was, you know, where I had to travel new or somewhere where maybe I had never, you know, I didn't know anyone or something like that.  But, I would never do it now.  I mean, I couldn't for one thing.  But, I -- I, you know, I just couldn't.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can't now, ever again, you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Till I retire maybe and the kids are gone and my husband and I can do some of that stuff.  But, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, I -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- understand 'cause I guess now -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- you know, you have bills to pay and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you can't just be, ah, id- idealistic --
L:  Right.
R:  -- about it.  You can't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just go and say, "Well, hey, well tomorrow I'm just going to let -- just backpack through Europe just because ..."
L:  Yeah, right! [NOISE] 
R:  Or I'm -- I'm going to just, you know, I'm going to be a artist.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  "I'm just going to st- stop working and just sell paintings for a living.  There I go". 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well --
R:  You know. 
L:  -- I mean, I think about what I used to live on every month, you know, as far as a wage.  My gosh, how did I do it?  [LAUGH] I mean --
R:  Yeah, that's -- 
L:  -- how did I survive?  [LAUGH] Because, I look at my bills now and I go, "Oh, man, ooh la la" yeah, but, um ...
R:  Yeah.  I think that's when you have -- you know, tell me -- are you -- where you worry less about those things 'cause I guess then, you know, everyone, you know, was like, "Wow, just deal, whatever".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  No- nobody's thinking about well, you know, what's the long term impact.  You know, ah, you know, being responsible.
L:  Right 
R:  You know, you don't think about it until -til later on.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then it's like, you are enjoying being irresponsible --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or, you know, just doing whatever, you know, yack a little.  Live off just a little money and yeah, I can hang out every day.  You know -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- you wonder how you party with little money. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah right, right.  I mean I, yeah.  I'll tell you, you know that saying, "Youth is wasted on the -- on the young" it's so true.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not that I'm old, I mean I'm thirty seven.  I, you know, I'm still quite young but, ah, you know, my life is completely differently, ah -- you -- so.  I think that's -- that's probably, I mean, maybe -- maybe I would have, ah -- if I could time travel knowing what I know now I would probably hunt down my husband sooner.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Find him and marry him sooner.
R:  Oh.
L:  So that we could have spent some -- 'cause we got married a little -- you know, we were both in our early thirties and, um, we -- I think we would have spent -- if we had got married earlier we would have spent time just for us, with us.  Instead we were like, "Well, we don't want to wait too much longer to have kids" and all that, you know.  So, we -- we didn't have -- have a whole lot of time for us to be a married couple before children got into the picture and that type of thing.  But, yeah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anyway.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I -- I guess you know.  In that same token I would have been -- like to have, you know, done some things where I can be able to travel more now, you know, and just be able to, um, you know, see more -- have seen more of the world, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead of now playing catch-up, you know, to -- to try and do some of those things.
L:  Yeah, right.  Right.  I mean, you know, and I -- and I -- I was always so super -- super responsible that I'd never -- I didn't -- I can't say never, but I didn't do a lot of spontaneous things and I did -- back in ninety four I -- a friend called me, said she had an opportunity for lodging in France and she was going to go.  Did I want to go, and I made a decision and twenty one days later I was on a plane to Europe and, you know, I -- 'cause I figured I will never have a opportunity to do this again while I'm single.  You know, I just knew.  I mean, I was, you know, I'm twenty --
