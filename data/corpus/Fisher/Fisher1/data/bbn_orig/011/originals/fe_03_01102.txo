L:  Hello.
R:  This is -- this is Brad.
L:  Oh.  This is Denise.
R:  Hey, Denise.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Good.  Ah, so did it already start?
L:  I guess so.  So, it's supposed to be about bus- -- opening a business.
R:  Yeah.  Do you want to start it off?
L:  Um, sure [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, let's see, I've actually, ah, had a small business with the family before, so if I had unlimited funds, that would be a wonderful thing because it's definitely ah the old saying of it takes money to make money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that's [MN].
R:  Now, what kind of business was it?
L:  It was a, um, photo development, like a one hour photo store.
R:  Oh, cool.  Oh, okay.  Very cool.
L:  What about you?
R:  Well, ah, I guess if I were to start a business, ah, probably fall somewhere in that actual photography range also, ah, because I'm an amateur photographer and I think that would be a lot of fun to just help people out with that, um, not a lot of profit there, though, um [LAUGH].
L:  That's where -- where the money, ah, if you have all the -- the equipment available to you and, um, you got to know what kind of -- what kind of service you want to offer I think, if it's going to be custom or just, you know the -- the quick one hour, you know, here's what you get.
R:  Well, yeah, I guess I'd go with the, ah, custom, you know, have all the higher -- higher priced brands and all that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- good stuff, you know.  So, well, I think I'd do that.  I never really wanted to start my own business, though, honestly.  What about you?
L:  It -- after doing it the first time, it's a lot -- especially that type of service, it's a lot of work.  I went through a period as working my full time job, going to the store, working a couple of hours, we'd close for an hour or so, go get something to eat and then I was back and I would be there pretty much through the night working on orders and then I'd go home, take a shower and go back to work.  And --
R:  Gee.
L:  -- pretty much did that for almost six months and finally said, can't do it anymore.  So, again, by having unlimited funds where you don't have to worry about if the business is actually making it, um, to pay your other bills as well would be an advantage, it would definitely take the -- the stress off of the situation and probably make it more enjoyable.
R:  Definitely.  Wow.  Yeah, I -- I was reading up on a study that showed that, ah, what is it, I want to see, ninety percent of businesses close their doors after ten years, I think, like they just don't make it --
L:  I would believe that.  I'm surprised it would even be ten years.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's way up there, it's just like you're running a long shot if you start your own business, but, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it takes the small businesses to make the bigger ones, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And -- and that's it.  There's a lot to invest and I think you have to realise, especially if you're coming from working at a -- at a normal type of job where everything's there already there for you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to realise that you might have to make some changes in the way you -- you do your normal everyday routines and you might not be able to have the fastest machines available for -- you have to slow it down a little bit, but, um, not go out and buy the best of everything to start with until you start getting some money in and -- and also seeing how it's going to work, how -- what kind of business you're going to be getting in for really what kind of equipment you're going to need to take care of it.  So --
R:  Yeah and I guess you -- you really got a lot of hard lessons ahead of you when you start a business for the first time.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And a lot of re- -- and -- it's you just have to -- I think you have to remember to kind of go slow and not jump in, not t- -- absolutely everything at one time, but if you start off slow then you're going to do better because you can [SIGH] um, figure out how to do -- do that thing and do it -- do it good.  And then continue, add more -- more offers out there.  Um, you know, like your custom work.  You know, if you're going to do color and then so you've got that, or maybe you do color on the machine and then you do like custom black and white -- which is so rare to find --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, and specialize, find your w- -- your speciality that no one else is doing and, ah, get your business growing that way and that would be a good thing.  But, it just takes, ah, it takes time and you can't rush it and you can't expect to -- you can't expect to make money right away, either, which is, I think, a big, um, a big thing that people expect.  And it's a disappointment to them.
R:  Yeah.  You're supposed to be in the red for two or three years for sure, like, just losing money at least for two or three years --
L:  I think it's not --
R:  -- with every small business.
L:  Yeah.  It's not -- it's not unexpected to have that happen.  Um, it's, ah, there's just so much cost involved in starting up, and especially like a photo type thing, your supplies, you have to have paper, you have to have chemicals and, um, you've got to figure out where your break even point is and it -- I think it takes time to figure -- it's kind of hit and miss, you try to figure it all out and -- and, ah, what kind of -- coming up with your pricing and what kind of hours you're going to offer and the whole -- whole thing.  Plus, if you're going to have employees or you're going to do it yourself, you know, like we did, um, it's ah -- there's a lot to it and it's very, it can be a very stressful time [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  We learned that.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  I don't know, I was just thinking like if I -- if funds were really not an issue, I think they're -- what they're driving towards is what's your dream small business, or what would you just love doing and I think I would love to do a, ah, casino party, ah, company.
L:  Oh.  Those are very cool.
R:  I know, I -- I love --
L:  I -- I've had those at -- at company parties, we've had those and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as part of -- as part of like the holiday party and that's a fun thing, um --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that would be, I think for me, it would be my sister in-law's actually a jewelry designer and that's a very tough thing starting out in, so if I had unlimited funds, I would love to be able to fund her in doing that, getting her set up and because the work she does is awesome, but you're talking, you know, platinum and eighteen carat and fine gems and everything and that's expensive.  And it's -- it's definitely a high end type of thing and, um, but knowing the work that she does, I'd love to be able to help out with something like that and really get it set up in the right way, but --
R:  So, you'd be the, ah, the primary investor, then?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Th- -- that's excellent.
L:  And, um, I -- and I [inaudible] doing some of the business stuff because I don't think she quite has the head for that.  She's definitely the designer side, um, but, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I'd be able to kind of just write the checks and -- and -- and find the right place for her, you know, the store to be set up and do that kind of footwork and -- and as side benefits you get to have trips to Italy or --
R:  Ho ho.
L:  -- Thailand or whatever to on your shopping, you know, once she goes looking for [LAUGH] for her jewelry.  Um, that would be the -- the side benefit.  Um, but I think that would be -- would -- would at this point for me would probably be the thing that I would -- would like to do.  I would enjoy that because, [inaudible] I've seen her -- her work and -- and knowing what she's capable of would be a -- a fun -- fun thing for me [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that'd be cool and that way you get to --
L:  So --
R:  -- explore the marketing sides of it and everything.
L:  Right.  Right.  That's a very different, um, [LIPSMACK] world from what I'm used to, so it's just nothing that I've ever done before and retail is so different and I think high end jewelry is very different because it's -- it's [inaudible] where most people just go in and see something and say, yeah I'll take it, it's -- it's a more emotional purchase and so, um, it's a -- a different side for people.
R:  A lot more personal purchase, also.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Like you don't want to go to Robinsons May and spend three grand on -- on a necklace, you want it made by somebody that you've made a personal connection with.
L:  Right.  Right.  And you can see the detail.
R:  At least, that's for me.
L:  That -- yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's -- that's -- that's it.  And, ah, but at the same time, like your idea on the casino thing, that's a -- a fun, [MN] you know, fun thing and it's another kind of, um, people, you know, because it's not real money and so people just kind of can play and do -- it's a -- a fantasy.  It puts them in a fantasy world which I think everyone needs, um, these days [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, agreed [LAUGH].
L:  So.  And I'm not sure how much, um --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  -- how much of the  -- I'm not sure how much of a, a -- dollar resource you would need to start something like that.
R:  Well, I've -- I mean, I do a annual casino party at my house, but it's ah, obviously, you know, just total, you know, cheap stuff, just --
L:  [LAUGH]
