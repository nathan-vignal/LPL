L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Julie.
R:  I'm Janice.
L:  Hi, where are you from?
R:  I am living in Portland in Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay.  I live in Redding, California.
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so I guess the conversation is supposed to be about time travel and if you did change something [LAUGH] that you did in the past.  Mm, it's an interesting one.
R:  Yeah, have you done these conversations before?
L:  Ya know, this is my first one.
R:  Me too.
L:  Is it?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I signed up like a month and a half ago.
L:  Well, yeah.  That's what -- I -- and in fact they [COUGH] called me.  This is the third time they've called me because I had forgotten my pin number.
R:  Right.
L:  So, they [LAUGH] hung up on me the other two times.  So [LAUGH] I'm actually glad they're -- they are persistent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I finally found it this time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, what we think something I would change.  Um, do you have one off the top of your head?
L:  Oh, goodness, um, you know, probably -- probably I -- if I had something that I could go back and change, um, it would be maybe, um, my college experience.  Kinda be a little more serious toward studies and less [LAUGH] less involved in, you know, the party scene and, um [COUGH] there for, you know, fun --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as opposed to being there for, you know, life -- life preparation.  [LAUGH] 
R:  When, ah, when did you go to college and what did you study?
L:  Well, um, let's see that was, um, back in the early eighties --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I was there from, um, nineteen eighty to eighty four.  And, um, I went to a small, um, small school in southern California called Alan Hancock --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- College.  And, um, so anyway it was just -- it -- you know, it was really a -- a time th- th- th- that I was not serious.  I graduated a year early from highschool so I was a little young and, um, probably not quite as mature as -- as I would, you know, as I can see now.  I mean, of course at that time I thought I was just really big stuff.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Right.  Um, but, you know, as I look back on it now I think, you know, I just could've made me better -- better grades, better use of my time.  But, I majored in music.
R:  And then did you use that afterwards?
L:  -- so ...
L:  Actually, um, you know, I didn't.  [LAUGH] Other than for, um -- but not professionally.  I use -- I use it in my life, um, ah, and y- y- you know it's a I -- it's -- it was, um, vocal music so I really have used it over the years, um, in a number of different ways in my church and -- and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- different things.  But, um, now actually I went into sales and, um, kind of went up through the ranks of the sales management and so forth.  But, um ...
R:  That's much different.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Very different.  Very, very, very different.  But, um, you know, it -- it -- it's been a good career so [SIGH] um, anyways, well what about you?
R:  Yeah, mine was sort of along the same lines, but I was trying to think of something more [LAUGH] interesting -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like, um, I was thinking about, um, I'm in grad school right now --
L:  Ha.
R:  -- and, um, when I graduated from college I took about five years off in between and I didn't really know that I was going to go on to school and so I didn't have a lot of direction during those five years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, I worked and I travelled a bit but I, you know, wasn't quick to think about going on to school.  And, now that I'm there I'm -- I'm really enjoying myself.  I just went back at the beginning of this year.
L:  Really.
R:  And, from the moment I started school I really started regretting that I didn't do this sooner.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, it's something where, you know, I've enjoyed -- I've enjoyed the last five years but I've also am enjoying what I'm doing so much now -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I'm studying.  I'm teaching English as a second language -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I decided, you know, getting involved in teaching classes and I really feel like that's my niche.  That's what I want to do.  And so, you know, I've kind of regretted not getting more experience or not getting into it quicker.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, and along the same lines when I was an undergrad I -- I didn't think I would ever go on to a masters so I didn't -- I probably wasn't as focused on the grades -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, you know, getting experience in classrooms or, you know, getting the kind of experience that might help me later if I were to, you know, go on.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  But, I'm enjoying what I'm doing now.  So ...
L:  Oh good.  That's interesting.  Okay, and -- and so you're -- you're going to get your masters in -- in languages or what?
R:  Um, it's a TESOL.  Teaching English to speakers of other languages, so it's through an [inaudible] linguistics department.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then, um, I'm also studying Japanese.
L:  Oh, cool.  Do you hope to go there and be a translator or -- or do something with the government in that regard or what -- what's your eventual hope?
R:  Um, I thought about spending time in Japan and I think if I find myself graduated and I don't have a lot of -- if I don't have anything, I mean, keeping me in the States -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's hard to tell what you're life is going to be like in a couple of years -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whether it will be easy to move to another country or not.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, then I would probably do that.  There's a lot of -- like good programmes teaching English in Japan and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, I thought about government work to but I think it would depend on, um, I think, [several inaudible words] about time or --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know, just kind of -- I don't want to get sent somewhere that I'm not ready to be.  If I start doing government work -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or get involved in something that I'm not ready to be involved with, so I've just trying to keep the options open.  Next quarter I'm going to be assisting, um, one of our professors, um, teaching English.
L:  Mm.
R:  We have a programme where, you know, students come from -- a lot of students seem to come from Japan and Korea, China -- 
L:  Really?
R:  -- um, to study English --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so I'll, you know, be helping teaching a class like that.
L:  What -- what school were you?
R:  Brooklyn State University.
L:  Okay.  Oh.
R:  And I've also done some obser- observing in, um, classes more for refugees and not necessarily through the university but through community colleges or community organizations.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so I've been going -- it seems like two different, um, futures.  You know, working with people that are here to try to make a new life in the United States need a whole different set of skills than somebody that's going to go back to their home country and maybe try to use English in business or [inaudible].
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I have been going back and forth between those.
L:  Really.  Well, that's interesting.
R:  It probably depends on who will hire me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, you do the same stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for either of them.  So --
L:  And, you know, that's really [LAUGH] -- that is really what it all boils down to.  I mean, if you find -- if you can end up finding a job that you love that you don't dread getting up in the morning and going to, that's [LAUGH] certainly -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- certainly the goal and, you know, that's what happened with me.  I just happened on to this company that I really liked and, um, you know, and I needed to work, you know, I was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] school I had student loans out there ahead of me and so it was time, you know, to definitely do something.  And, um, you know it just didn't -- it really -- you know, I was very unfocussed so I didn't really know what I would do with that degree once I got done with it 'cause, you know, I didn't do -- like a go teaching thing, or anything like that.  It was just, you know, vocal performance and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, there are -- I mean, the -- the percentage of people that -- that actually do, um, um, go professional and have a -- a professional career in music are [inaudible] the numbers are few.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, you've got to be something really, really, special to -- either to get that but, ah --
R:  But, I think in general college gives you a set of skills no matter what.
L:  -- oh, absolutely -- 
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- just, yeah, to be able to, you know, live your life and -- and, oh, no question about it.  I mean I think, um -- I think everybody should have that college experience.  You know, it's -- 
R:  I studied my under graduate.  I studied anthropology which --
