L:  Hi, this is Linda.
R:  Hi, this is Tamara.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] How are you?
L:  Okay.  This is the first time I've done this, so --
R:  Yeah, me too [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  I -- I just -- I scurried all over trying to find the co- -- the number.
R:  Oh.
L:  Anyway.  So, we're supposed to be talking about ah --
R:  If we go back in time, what we would change.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're asking the right person because I've got, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm just -- well, I've been divorced for twelve years now --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  And I have, ah, I have a -- a fourteen year old little boy who's developmentally disabled so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- this -- this could go on for hours 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now I d- -- I don't know, why don't you start because [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.  Why don't you start because then it'll give me a few minutes to think about it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, you know.  That's just -- boy.  I -- I -- I -- all I can think of is when I was in my twenties it was, um, it was very enjoyable [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I miss it immensely --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I wish that I would have appreciated that time more because now, you know, I can't do any of that now, I'm a full time mom and I will be for the rest of my child's life, probably --
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH] uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I -- I'm just -- I'm grateful that I, ah, did what I did when I was twenty, but I actually wish that, yeah, I could go back enjoy a little bit more of that time and appreciate a little bit more.
R:  Huh.
L:  You know.
R:  That's interesting.  I'm in my twenties.
L:  Oh, well then, take my advice.
R:  So, that's interesting to hear [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Take my advice.  And enjoy it because it's probably going to be your most ah enjoyable, you know, less stressful, I mean, this is --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you don't imagine how much stress you're going to have --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as you get, I mean, what you think, you never, I mean, I never dreamed that such a thing was going to happen, you know, I for one thing never thought I was going to be divorced --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then to top it off, y- -- who -- he's two years old and sick and I'm going through a divorce and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- well, you know, I've doing this by myself forever, it seems --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, yeah, I would -- I would probably just change ah, a few of my, ah, judgment calls [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Not that I would want to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ah, not have my child, because I love him, but the husband, the husband thing [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Choose a different husband?
L:  Yeah, I would have definitely --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I would have stuck with one of those hu- -- one of those guys that I's going out with when I was in my twenties --
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].
L:  -- but I was enjoying my freedom at the time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because, uh, yeah I had a tough childhood, so when I got o- -- out -- when I moved out at nineteen, boy it was just the greatest thing, I was just enjoying my life, you know, but I was th- -- a- -- ah -- appreciating it as much as I wish I had.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, I think that I could go back, not that far -- I'm twenty seven --
L:  Mm.  Right, now --
R:  -- um, and I'm married and I have a six month old son --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and um I think that I would spend more time -- my husband and I met when we lived in New York City and, ah, we're now in Alabama and I think that I had graduated from college and moved up to New York on my own, not knowing a soul up there and just started my career and started a life for myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that I would go back and push off my husband and I deciding to leave New York so quickly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's kind of like we had a bad day and said, "That's it, let's move" and we actually moved to Florida --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I think that I would say that I prefer, I -- if I could change anything I would have stayed up there longer and spent more time with my career and just doing that whole thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, up there and, I mean I look back on it and that was like such a great time in my life and I think that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he and I should have spent more time doing that because when we moved to Florida we got married --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, two and a half years later we had a child and so, you know, being able to spend more time --
L:  Mhm.  See, that sounds similar to me.  I was -- I w- -- but I was twenty nine when I got married.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then, uh, like less than two years I had -- I had my son, but, ah, yeah, that's -- it's always you kn- -- that's what I think you know I would -- I -- I wish I had a -- thought about my career more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and -- and done s- -- well, you know, I thought I was going to be married and taking care of a family, that's really --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what I was planning on doing, but now I wish I had done -- if I could turn back the time, I'd be in court reporting school right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what I would be doing [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [inaudible] I sit on this computer twenty four hours a day now, I just enjoy this computer so much and I think boy, you know, if I just had stuck to, you know, maybe a -- I couldn't really afford college, but some kind of schooling --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, g- -- I could be so far -- so much farther ahead.
R:  Right.
L:  Even -- even in the same situation with my son, I could just -- life would be a whole lot easier --
R:  Yeah.  And you don't have the opportunity now to do the training?
L:  No, I really can't.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't even drive and -- and if I could turn back the clock I'd like to be a different person so as I didn't have that fear of driving [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because after I gave birth to my son, the fear intensified --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- because I couldn't even think of, ah, getting in the car and putting my son in the car at the same time and driving at all --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that was totally out of it.  So --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, there's -- there's -- there's a lot of things I could, ah, would like to change if I could turn back the clock.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] think about it, that's a very good subject, seriously, I could go on and on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] They must have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know, they must have done a survey and saw what I was doing here [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, boy.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I guess because I would like to change that part as far as you know, spending more time in that part of my life, like, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- geographically and what was going on because it was such a wonderful time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, but if -- but if I could change it then I wouldn't be here and I probably wouldn't have my six month old son and --
L:  And that -- that's exactly --
R:  -- you know, have this wonderful life --
L:  -- how I feel --
R:  -- you know, and [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  That's exactly how I feel too is I -- I love my son --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't change anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for the world because I -- I have him, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just l- -- like career options and just maybe enjoying a little more and appreciating a little more when I was younger so that, ah, maybe I wouldn't be missing it so much right now [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] I have -- it probably would -- you know, if I was able to get out and do it, I wouldn't probably be missing so much --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't know, it's hard to explain.  Hard to explain.  I- -- It's not like I -- I think all the time, "Oh, I wish I was back in time" you know, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there are some instances where you just think, boy, if I'd a made one different judgment call --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- things would be different.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess that, you know -- I don't know, I guess no matter what you do, no matter how fully you live your life, you'll probably -- you- -- there's probably always something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, you know, well, what if I had done this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead or, you know, made this decision instead of that decision and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no matter what you do, that's always --
L:  Yeah, that's like -- I [inaudible] up with my first love, I just wish I'd of married him.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Still.  I mean, we were still friends, you know, for a long time --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I've lost contact with him, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, there was another person in my twenties I had met, but I was enjoying freedom --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, didn't realize what I had at the time.
R:  Yeah.  Wow.
L:  You know, if you -- I think about it all the time, thinking, boy, you know, if I'd of just, ah, stopped for a second and thought about it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I probably would have -- I would have -- I most definitely would have married him because he was a perfect family man, very smart --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know.  And instead [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I chose freedom and how ironic is it that now I have no freedom [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh [LAUGH]
L:  You know.  I realy don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Twenty four hours a day taking care of my son --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- e- -- even when he's in --
R:  Is he -- does he go to school or --
L:  W- -- well, when he's in school then I am, uh, taking care of things that I can't take care of when he's home --
R:  When he's around.  Yes.
L:  So, it's -- I mean, I was working for a while, but then I -- I tore my, ah, rotor cuff on my shoulder so that stopped me from doing the kind of work I was doing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so now I'm just, I mean, I -- I enjoy taking care of my son full time, but it would have been a whole lot nicer if financially, you know, I had made difference choices --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when I was younger.
R:  Right.  Huh.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just, I- -- it's funny how you just appreciate things differently.
R:  Yeah.  I'm trying so hard to try -- you know, just to -- to appreciate the stage that we're in our lives now, um --
L:  You most definitely should --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seeing as I'm -- I'm past that, well, I'm forty three years old, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] because the grey hairs are popping out --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] like, you know, I'm a -- I'm -- I'm a kind of a young forty three --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so when the grey hairs popped out, I went into shock --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- my son was laughing at me in fact as I was looking in the mirror going oh, my god [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he was just hysterical, laughing at me --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, um, then I -- I d- -- I went to work that day and I went home and I dashed to the beauty salon and I said, "You have to do something" [LAUGH].
R:  You have to do that [LAUGH].
L:  That's [MN].
R:  Fix it [LAUGH].
L:  This cannot be happening [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it was v- -- you know, I'd never thought of myself as having grey hair.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, I just -- I'm a young -- I'm young at, ah, heart probably [LAUGH] so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think about that kind of stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then the shoulder goes and the grey hairs pop and I say oh, god, here we go [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And it really makes you think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  Boy, I should have done this or that when I was younger.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  A friend of mine was telling me when I had our son, she's like, you know, the whole time she -- when her kids were little she kept thinking, Oh, I can't wait till they can do this, or, you know, c- --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- till they can talk or they can crawl --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or they can walk and she said she spent their whole, you know, the -- their whole
