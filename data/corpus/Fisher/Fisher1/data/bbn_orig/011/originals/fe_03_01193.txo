L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Hi, good.  How are you?
L:  Good.  I guess we should start discussing, would we give [MN] would we speak to our best partner.  I mean, our best friend, if we had a million dollars.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh ... the way I feel about it is, if she didn't want to talk to me, I would -- I would try to share it with her but if she don't want to talk, then I must move on.
R:  Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do in that situation [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Maybe um ... yeah, I -- I'm with you, yeah, maybe.  If she's -- she doesn't want to share it with me, I'll just blacklist her but if she -- she doesn't want to ...
L:  Is it that we get this million dollars or does the friend have the million dollars?  [MN]
R:  I think it's we -- we get the mi- -- the -- like, the conditions that we can get that million dollars is that we cannot talk to her again.  I don't know.
L:  Oh, okay.  That would be a hard decision to make.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause best friends sometimes goes way back to school days.
R:  Right.
L:  And when you grow up real little uh, then you become adults, you go through different things like having kids or getting married and you have so much in common.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ... it will -- a million dollars is a lot to think about too.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so --
L:  [LAUGH]  I guess everybody lose friends when it comes to money.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You [SIGH] -- you have to make a -- make a decision between friendship and money [LAUGH].
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's the decision, between friendship and money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  It's just a tough one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But um, I guess if it was put in real life, um ... the answer would come out.  Who -- I mean, your true friend.  I real- -- I don't know, that's a hard decision.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  So ... if -- if we're true friend, we -- we can't get money, is that true or ... is that the ...?  [MN].
L:  I don't think ... let me see, would you lose your friend if you can't get the money.
R:  Uh ...
L:  Uh ... lose the friend and get the money.
R:  Okay.
L:  Make new friends.
R:  So you ... [MN].
L:  But you know that would put you in a different um category anyway.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If you had a million dollars, you would have to run with the million dollar friends.
R:  Right, right.  'Cause you and your friend will be in the -- two different worlds after you get the money.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  [MN]  I -- I would say take -- take the million dollars.
R:  Yeah, maybe, uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  'Cause after you get the money you probably you will lose your friend anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or maybe once a year, send a christmas card.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Um ...
R:  So, what should we do next?  Do you know?
L:  Um ... either, I would say, take the million dollars ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um ... and send the friend a postcard once a year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you had to decide between the two.
R:  Mhm  [NOISE].
L:  Um ... it's really a hard decision.  Um ... then you can pretend you're going out of town or, you know, like the -- the war people, the people going into the service.  You're going away for a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I agree with you.
L:  Mhm.  [MN]  Tough decision.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good topic.  It's a good topic [MN].
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, it's one we're gonna be thinking about um ... I think I -- I would probably have to talk to the friend first.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wonder if -- if, you know, if you don't tell them you got the million dollars ...
R:  Right but they give --
L:  They'll find out 'cause you'll have a new uh new ... different things start showing up.  You'll be getting new things.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if she cares you or maybe [MN] she just wants you to be rich, you know [MN] [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  'Cause I don't think Oprah's best friend is rich as she is, and they're still friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mm.  Now, that's a good situation to base it on.  Mm.
R:  Mm.
L:  A million dollars ... your best friend.
R:  Yeah.  Did -- did he say it's your best friend or just a friend?
L:  Best friend.
R:  Oh, really?  Wow [SIGH].
L:  The best friend, you know, the best?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The best friend, that's what gets you right there.  You make tears come to your eyes, your best friend.
R:  Mhm [MN].
L:  [MN]  Some people think of their mother as their best friend.  You know, or a sister could be sister and best friend.
R:  Right.  Mm.
L:  Mm.  I would have to share.
R:  Yeah, maybe.
L:  But then, like they say, you have to make a choice between one or the other.
R:  Right.
L:  I see ... I tell ya.  [NOISE]  But you can always get ano- -- can you always get another best friend or you can always get another million dollars?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  That million dollars only come once.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Mm ... mm.  A million dollars.
R:  Mm.
L:  Choose the million dollars for a while.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah and then --
L:  [MN] mhm ... takes the -- [MN] yeah, I would -- I think I would have to take the million dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I still say I have to take the million dollars.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, take the million dollars and get another best friend [LAUGH].
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I agree.  [LAUGH]  I agree with that.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I guess we made the decision, right?
L:  Yes, we have a decision.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.  Take the million dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that's a good idea.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, do we have to wait 'til the buzzer buzz or does it tell us the ten minutes is up or let's have a decision?
R:  I don't know.  This is my first time so ...
L:  Mine too.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh.
L:  So we are struggling through this.  Um ... this ten minutes.  I forgot to time it, really.
R:  So, it --
L:  When I --
R:  -- d- does that -- we have ten minutes?
L:  Supposed to talk ten minutes.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  About --
R:  So, we are supposed to talk about ten minutes for this topic?
L:  Of the topic, uh-huh.
R:  Oh.  Wow  [LAUGH].
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, we made a fast decision [LAUGH].
L:  A fast decision.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  But we were still discussing it, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ... because, you know, it's hard to turn and lose your best friend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's hard to make a decision about losing your best friend in ten minutes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Over a million dollars.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So ... you know, we're still deciding which one.  [LAUGH] We're still [MN] I think I'd still like to stick with the million dollars.
R:  Yeah, me too 'cause --
L:  A million dollars is a million dollars.
R:  Right.
L:  With a million dollars, you could clone a best friend.
R:  Mhm  [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  The ways uh scientific [MN] is now.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um ... technology and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know what?  I think, probably everyone has ... has her best friend in different period of time in their life, so ...
L:  Mhm.  They comes at different times in their lives.
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you can get another best friend when they -- when you're -- get -- making another situation, you know?
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And probably it would be a better best friend.
