L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  My name is Penny.
R:  I'm Cathy.
L:  And, ah, this is the first day I've done any of these, ah, I don't know if you've done it before or not?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is the first one for me, too.
L:  Okay.  Um, I guess the question was, if you could go back and, ah, change anything, what would it -- what would it be?
R:  [SIGH] Wow, I wonder if that means changing things that ordinarily we wouldn't have the power to change, or can we change something [LAUGH]?
L:  Ah, well I -- [LAUGH] -- my understand of the question --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- was like if -- if you could go back in time and change something that you've done --
R:  That we did, okay --
L:  -- and un- -- yeah, and undo it, you know, not do it --
R:  I wouldn't have gotten married [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] You know, that -- that was a- -- well, I -- I've already talked to, ah, m- -- I don't know, I -- I thought they would just have you talk about one subject one time, but actually I talked to one person earlier and they asked the same question, so I guess, you know, you just talk to other people, but, um, the -- the, ah, what I said was that I would probably not have moved away from where I grew up --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- moved [inaudible] far --
R:  Where -- where'd you grow up?  And where did you move?
L:  Um.  I grew up in Nebraska --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I moved to Texas.
R:  Wow.  Well, I'm in Texas and I -- I used to have a lot of family in Omaha.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, that's where -- around where I grew up was Omaha.
R:  Know any Cattlemans?
L:  No.  Um ...
R:  I think that was the main last name at the time, but --
L:  But -- but, ah, [MN] yeah, that's, ah, I lived -- lived there for almost thirty years and been in Texas for twenty years, so -- and my daughter grew up here, so this is kind of home, but, ah, I guess we're supposed to talk about the reason why we would change it and pretty much, well, I w- -- [LAUGH] I've kind of had a little more time to think about it since, ah, since I talked to the last person, but, um, the main thing is I -- it -- I think about is like if I would have stayed where I was, well, actually we lived ina  small town, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- close to Omaha, Springfield, it's south of Omaha, and, ah, so it was a small community -- which most communities in Omaha -- in, ah, Nebraska are -- and, ah, you know, with kind of a deal where you know everybody and everybody knows you and you know their aunts and uncles and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cousins and everything else and [MN] it would have been kind of interesting if my daughter would have, ah, went to the same schools I went to, had the same teachers I went to and all that kind of stuff and to, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just the comfort of kind of knowing everybody where -- where I live now I don't really know, y- -- it's like the people you, um, grew up with, you ne- -- once you're an adult it's kind of like I don't -- you meet people but they're, it's never the same as the people you grew up with knowing, to me.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can -- I -- I've been in Texas all my life, but I grew up in Houston and I moved to Dallas, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I was eighteen, so even that much of a -- of a distance --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- changed --
L:  When you're talking about Texas [LAUGH] that's all, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it's, you know, it's three hundred miles --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I -- there's -- there's almost nobody that I know from like my elementary school days and things.  I look around online every once in a while.  I -- I was in a -- when I was in first grade my school was blown up --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and -- in Houston -- and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I've only met one person that was there at the time that, you know, that remembers it --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and it's kind of been an interesting thing to search, but I don't -- I don't, I mean, I wouldn't have changed moving away, I wouldn't have survived if I hadn't, but I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I [inaudible].  Your -- you're a- -- your voice is similar to -- to one of my cousins that was from Omaha.  You, um, let's see, Phil and -- Phil Wayne, d- --
L:  No.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Doesn't sound familiar.  Um --
R:  Well, they moved to -- they're in Colorado now, but they lived in Omaha for -- my dad's -- my dad's mother's sister and all her family -- is what who it was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN]
L:  I st- -- most of my family moved down here, ah, I mean the main reason we -- my husband and I and my daughter, she was only four at the time and we wanted to get away from the cold winters and --
R:  Ooh [LAUGH].
L:  -- my parents had already moved down here, so, um, that's, ah, that's pretty much the main reason and I really like it here.  It's kind of like I wish I would have been born here, you know, that would have kind of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- solved the whole problem of not wanting to move, then I would have already been where -- where I wanted to be, but, ah, growing up where I wanted to be, but, ah, because well I live close to San Antonio, so --
R:  Ah, um, I was born in Austin.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I worked at the [inaudible] Folk Festival for about twenty years until my body gave out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- I'm a hill country baby but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  My daughter, ah, just graduated from South West Texas.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, ah, we go up to San Marcus fairly often.
R:  That's where my sister went.  She graduated from there and I have a [MN] well, I have got a lot of good friends in -- in -- or a really good friend in San Marcus.
L:  Yeah.  That's [inaudible] I really like the San Marcus area, that's nice.  She works at the [inaudible] Green --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have you ever been there?
R:  No, but I've heard of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I used to work with, ah, musicians, song writers, ah --
L:  Yeah.  Pretty, pretty nice area there.
R:  Oh, it's beautiful.  It is so beautiful.  And there's -- been down there a lot [MN].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And after -- but I mean I've been in Dallas for thirty something years, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- every once in a while I think about retiring to Austin or --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- somewhere around but I don't drive, I'm d- -- multiply disabled, so --
L:  Are you?
R:  I've --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  I think the system would be kinder to me there, but -- but I know the system here.  So, I'm not sure [LAUGH].
L:  S- -- yeah, I have, well I have fibromyalgia and, ah, I'm on social security disability and I don't drive --
R:  So you, yeah, you -- you'd understand.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I 
R:  Yeah.  I have MS and a few other things --
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  So, I guess since you said that you wouldn't have got married, you're divorced [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't last very long.  And it was one of those, I just kind of knew that in the back of mind I shouldn't, but -- but both --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all of our parents wanted it so badly --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which now of course would be a much bigger red flag, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  -- it might -- if it's -- if the parents are happy, something's seriously wrong with this [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least in my family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, you know, I- -- I don't -- all things considered, I guess I was pretty lucky, I mean he took -- screwed up my credit forever and took most of my paintings, but I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, I haven't seen him since and it's been over ten years, so that's not bad.
L:  Huh.  Well, my -- I've been married for twenty eight years and there -- if you would have asked me at a -- various times during that twenty eight years, I probably would have said I wish I wouldn't have got married, but, ah, it's, ah, it's all worked out and, um, you know after twenty eight years I've got him trained -- I was [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I always tell people, you know, after twenty eight years I've got him trained to at least do a few of the things that, ah, without having to ask him and, ah, a- -- actually my fibromyalgia came on after a car accident --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in ninety three and, ah, I really had a lot of trouble sin- -- with my health, had all kinds of health problems since then and, ah, and I was used to always being the one to take care of everything, you know --
R:  Yeah.  I do, I mean, that -- that's -- that's what makes me nuts is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- is I'm just -- it's so hard for me to ask for help.  I live by myself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm real cl- -- I'm real shut in, I just got a letter from the State Services saying that they may cut off my home attendant, which would mean --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- I'd have to move into a nursing home and that's really daunting.
L:  Oh, boy.  That's
R:  I just -- I like the illusion that I have some independence, even though I really don't.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  Ah, like I say, I don't drive but at least I have my husband and my daughter to take me somewhere or, um, most of the time I don't feel like going anywhere and there -- every once in a while I'll, if I feel like I can concentrate enough and whatever, I'll drive a short distance, but, um it was really, I mean, I- -- it was really, um, a big change in my life because I was always the main wa- -- wage earner, my -- my husband always pretty much did like construction work and stuff just on his own and, ah, I was the one with the benefits and everything and of course everything with my daughter, he never really participated in anything and, ah, I did all of that and took care of the house and everything else, but he always has mowed the lawn [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've never once mowed the lawn since we've been married, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, wow.  So, that's good.  I mean, that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a [inaudible] --
L:  But, um --
R:  Not an easy thing.
L:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] So, ah, yeah, I know what you -- I, ah, sure you get -- feel like you're isolated.
R:  I- -- in some ways I -- I do, um, I live kind of in a retirement community sort of apartment building, so there's -- there's always people if I -- if I got lonely and, you know, there's usually people down the lobby talking or something, but my whole life was at night all my life --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I wake up, I come alive about ten at night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I worked in night clubs
