L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Well this is fun; this is my first call [LAUGH].
R:  This is mine, too, so we're sort of like, um, linguistic study virgins here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you located?
L:  I'm in, ah, Southern California.  How about you?
R:  Okay.  I'm in N- -- I'm in Northern California.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] What's your name?
L:  My name's Lisa.  You?
R:  And I'm Holly.
L:  Hi, Holly.
R:  I'm still thinking about the question, trying to think of what particular decision I would have changed.
L:  I -- I -- I immediately think of some things that I'm not going to discuss --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, we all have those.
R:  Yeah, we all have those.  Those are probably the ones we should talk about, but we don't need to have University of Pennsylvania tracking those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Oh, I know what -- what I'm willing to discuss that I would change.
R:  Okay.  Maybe, maybe -- should we talk about, um, your situation first while I think about what --
L:  While you think about yours?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I -- I would probably, ah, instead of majoring in something fun in college, I probably would have majored in something useful [LAUGH].
R:  What did you major in?
L:  Philosophy.
R:  Oh, that's fascinating.
L:  I thought so.  Unfortunately, ah, ah, let's just say, if you -- if you want to be able to eat, you know, during the rest of your life, ah, philosophy's not the best choice [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I think that what's happening right now in -- in terms of our country --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- regardless of what one decided to major in years ago in school, I'm not sure it would have made a significant difference because as far as I know, the economic situation's so bad that across the board cutting through all socio economic levels, all professions, people are out of work and having trouble finding jobs.
L:  This is -- this is true.  Well, my husband has his degree in biology ah -- he is now an en- -- a manufacturing engineer.  Ah, I have one brother who has a degree in ah engineering analysis.  He's currently unemployed [LAUGH].  Ah, you know, so I -- I wonder about this guy I knew back after college, ah, what the heck he's doing.  He had a degree in chinese history.  He sh- -- he should probably about starved to death by now [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Well, I got a PhD in microbiology and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- my career took several interesting turns after doing many years of research, both in academia and then in industry.  Then I went into market research, then I went into, um, advertising for biotech and pharmaceutical and healthcare.  But now I find myself unemployed because the company I worked for had sixty five people; they now have six.
L:  Ew.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, we know how downsize to death goes.
R:  Right.  So, I --
L:  Ah, since -- since my husband left the navy.  He used to be navy.  Ah, since he left the navy he's worked for one, two, three -- ah, four different places I can think of right off the bat.  Ah, one of the places changed ownership three times.  Uh, then with the -- with the last one it was a case of, "Yes, welcome aboard.  By the way, we're getting rid of all of you, we've got our own people".
R:  Well, what happened to you -- back to, um, you said that you got a degree in philosophy -- what path, what career things did you take after you graduated?
L:  Well, I worked for a year for a social security administration --
R:  Interesting.
L:  That stunk [LAUGH]!  Ah, that -- that -- that was thoroughly depressing, ah, ah --
R:  Really, working in social services was depressing?
L:  Well, it -- ah, what I was doing, I was a, as they say, benefit authorizer trainee -- a BAT --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, learning how to ah supposedly learning how to [MN] program things for giving people their benefits, although as far as I was concerned it seemed to be trying to ah tell people why they weren't going to be getting their money, ah, it seemed that the main things that I ended up actually having to work with were the pr- -- were the problem cases.
R:  I see.
L:  You know.  You've been overpaid for the last two years.  Ah, hope you don't want to eat, you know [LAUGH] y- -- except of course you have to use a form letter.  Ah, I -- I -- I think they've gotten better about [MN] nicer about the way they deal with people than they used to be, I certainly hope so.  Ah [LAUGH] I -- I 
R:  And did you f- -- how -- how did you --
L:  -- I lost all faith in that system then [LAUGH].
R:  How did you get into that after getting a degree in philosophy, rather than getting a degree in traditional social sciences?
L:  Well, after getting, ah, after, ah, getting my BA in philosophy, I decided to pursue my masters because I didn't know what else to do except that, ah, the, ah, university where I was pursuing my masters basically drummed out all love of philosophy from me.  So, I stopped [LAUGH].
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah.  And, ah, I considered going into teaching; did -- took some, ah, education courses, realized that I would be a mediocre teacher at best, there's too many mediocre teachers, they didn't need another one ah [LAUGH] and, ah, in trying to come up with something to do, I found well, at least this was something I was, ah, I put an application, hey, they actually accepted me.  So [LAUGH] that's how I got into it.  Ah --
R:  And.  W- -- I -- and what would you do differently in terms of --
L:  Well, ac- --
R:  -- what other field would you have -- would now, in retrospect, would you rather have been trained in?
L:  Well, after I, ah, the day I graduated from college my father said, "Of course, I always thought you should have been an engineer" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- good timing, dad [LAUGH] and, ah, couldn't have mentioned this a few years back, huh?  And, ah --
R:  But it was your choice, not his.
L:  Yeah.  Well, he -- I --
R:  You followed -- you followed your passion and your interests at the time.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, my -- my major was technically listed as philosophy and religion because it was combined major at my college and my minor was social sciences or, as I say, I minored in hodgepodge.  Ah, I -- I basically would take any class that was something that sounded interesting that I didn't know anything about.  That was a mistake in chemistry, but [LAUGH] going in to c- -- going into chemistry in college when you've never had any chemistry, ah --
R:  It's tough.
L:  -- that's tough.  Well, I graduated a year early from high school and I skipped a year of college, so that sort of made a few things a little more interesting anyway.
R:  What do you think you would take now if you had to do it all over?
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  Which field -- what field would you pursue that in your mind is quote unquote more useful?
L:  Well, I might have gone into engineering, then again, at the time I might have gone into computer science, which of course would be completely useless now because --
R:  It has changed so much.
L:  -- what -- what I would have studied twenty five years ago, you know, would have --
R:  Has evolved.
L:  -- been, ah, archive material only now [LAUGH], so, um, you know [MN] ah, I -- I probably would have at least, you know, well, at the college I went to engineering would have been out, but, ah, I -- I -- I might have -- I -- I at least might have considered the idea [LAUGH] you know if I -- if I knew then what I know now, ah or considering my kids, I might have looked into, ah, something in abnormal psychology [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know if people specialize in abnormal child psychology, but I'm sure some people do.
L:  Ah, that -- that sounds cruel.  It's not meant to, actually.
R:  I know.
L:  Ah --
R:  I know.  I know.  It was a joke.  I -- I took it as a joke.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it -- it's sort of a joke, it's sort of serious.  Ah, my -- ah I have one autistic child, one Aspersers[?] Syndrome child.
R:  I know what that is.  That's the functional autism.
L:  It's -- it's -- it's like functional autism, yeah.  My son is -- is high functional and my daughter, like I say, is Aspersers, she's much -- she's much more vocal, more verbal than he is.  Thank goodness.  But --
R:  How old are they?
L:  Ah, he's twenty one, she's thirteen.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, yeah, there's -- there's challenges in life, aren't there?
R:  Constantly.  But the, I guess, the joy of it or supposed joy of it is how we learn from each of these things that happen.
L:  Yeah.  Well, one thing, I learned that, ah, one -- one thing you tend to learn is that you can deal with more than you thought you could deal with.  Ah, or at least that's something that you hope you learn.
R:  I guess parents have to learn that all the time.
L:  Oh, gosh, yes.  I still say, I want my owner's manual [LAUGH] regarding being a parent [LAUGH] wasn't there supposed to be an instruction book or something, there's one needed [LAUGH]! Oh, well, so what would you change, did you come up with any --
R:  Um
