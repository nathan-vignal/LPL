R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi [NOISE], my name is Beth.
L:  My name is Candy.
R:  Okay [LAUGH], nice --  
L:  Nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to meet [LAUGH] you too, um so --
L:  I'm not really sure how this works.  This is my first call --
R:  Me to.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] We're both new at this then.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about going back in time or something.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  To change something.
R:  -- I guess, if there's -- yeah, yeah --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- does anything come to mind for you?
L:  You know the only thing that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- really pops into my mind, a friend of mine -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, passed away, ah, about, ah, about three, four years ago --
R:  Mhm.  .
L:  -- and I just think I would have spent more time with her ...
R:  Oh.
L:  Before she died, you know --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- I mean, 'cause we were --
R:  Was she young?
L:  -- really good friends but we didn't spend, you know, a ton of time together because we both had families and everything.  Yes, she was forty.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, uh, she got breast cancer and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- died and -- and I always regret not spending ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  More time with her before she, um, passed away so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- what about, what about you?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Nothing really popped into my mind, of course.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah I like, things I wish I'd done with people is probably the thing that comes to mind the most, like, uh -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my grandma is still alive.  But she knows how to crotchet and knit, and make really cool things, and like, she -- her hands are starting to go bad and it's harder for her to do it and I wish I would have learned from her how to do that before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- while she's still got --
L:  My grandma does the same kind of stuff and ...
R:  -- still can.  That's -- uh-huh.
L:  it -- it -- when I was younger it was, you know, it seemed so silly and --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- now I wish I would have learned more from her because she's, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ninety --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one.
R:  Wow.
L:  And doesn't do any more because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- her hands are not, you know, steady enough --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that sort of thing, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where do you live?
R:  Um, in Michigan, near Detroit.
L:  Michigan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  All right, I'm in -- um, near Seattle, Washington.
R:  Oh you are!  Oh my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- husband is from Seattle.
L:  Who's that?
R:  My husband grew up in Seattle.
L:  Oh really, where at?
R:  Ah, um, Kent.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Are you serious?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  That's where I went to school. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  What's his name?
R:  Ah, Tim Brinkley.  [NOISE]
L:  What year -- 
R:  He graduated in ...
L:  -- did he graduate?
R:  Oh, let me think.  Ninety one.
L:  Oh, he's a young one then!
R:  So, yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well [LAUGH] it depends on who you're --
L:  I'm ten years older than that, so [LAUGH]
R:  Oh [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's a funny coincidence though.  [NOISE]
L:  That's -- that's funny though, yeah we -- I graduated from Catmeridian Highschool.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's --
L:  And, uh.
R:  -- that's funny.
L:  Started -- started out with my brothers --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, if he knows the last name Good ...
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  That is my maiden name --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- that's my brothers and myself, and --
R:  Oh, how cool.
L:  -- so --
R:  How cool.
L:  That is very weird.  How long have you lived up there?
R:  Um, well [NOISE] we met in, um, Hunt, Nebraska, where we both lived --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- after college [NOISE].  And we both had jobs there so we met there at church [NOISE] and uh, then my family [NOISE] is from Michigan and we looked for jobs in both places, and we started thinking about having kids and decided [NOISE] we wanted to move closer to one of our families and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- got a job in Michigan, so we moved that direction.  I almost had a job [NOISE] for a college called [inaudible] Sound Christian College.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't even know where it is [NOISE].  I don't know that much about Washington --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but [LAUGH] we almost moved there so [NOISE], hopefully we might still do that some day though --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- 'cause we kinda of like to spend time around both families.  [NOISE]
L:  Is that his family still lives here?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Do they still live in Kent?
R:  They've just moved to Covington[?] about --
L:  Covington?
R:  Yeah, just --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- recently, yeah.
L:  That's where my daughter goes to pre-school.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That is wild. [LAUGH]
L:  That is too weird!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is really strange that we talk on the phone and --
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] -- he's from the same place.
R:  Ah, that is funny.  Yeah.
L:  How did you get set up on this program?
R:  [NOISE] Ah, a website.  Ah, I don't even remember the name of it.  Um [NOISE], something that I found that just does things you can make money at from home. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah, 'cause I just -- we just had our baby [NOISE] last August, and ah --
L:  Oh, congratulations.  Boy or girl?
R:  Oh, thank you.  A boy.
L:  Oh, right!
R:  But, ah, yeah, he's seven months old now.  He's still in his highchair and getting cleaned up from dinner.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's right, it's a little bit later there.  It's still the afternoon here --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- so [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You just forget about that.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's --
L:  Great.
R:  -- yeah, it's fun.
L:  Does your grandmother that you were talking about live around you now, or --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- is she --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh [NOISE].  Yep, and she still does do a few things for [inaudible] still --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like calls like this.  Talking about it makes me think -- 
L:  [LAUGH] really.  Gets you motivated to call your grandmother.
R:  -- "I could still do that".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.  Yeah, yeah, you know, I could still do that and I keep talking about it.  I should be, like, write it down or make it a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  New Year's [NOISE] resolution or something like --
L:  Yeah.  The only thing I would probably do is -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is go back to school tomorrow.  I didn't finish.  I quit.
R:  Oh.
L:  Right?  I work.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, never finished getting my degree or anything and I think if I had the chance to do it over again and --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- if we had the money I'd go do it now, but ...
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Do you have --
L:  It's still an expense that just doesn't ...
R:  Yeah.  Do you have children?
L:  Yeah, I have a boy that's seven -- or eight, excuse me, he just turned eight.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And a daughter that's five.
R:  Oh [NOISE].  How neat -- 
L:  They keep me very busy.
R:  Yeah, I'm sure that keeps you busy though.
L:  Yes.  Too busy some days [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  This call came three different times and I wasn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I was always on the phone.
R:  Oh.
L:  When it ca- -- when it came I was like, "Oh, I missed it again, I missed it again".
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  I told my husband in case they called, "Can you answer and come find me?"
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So I don't miss it a third time.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it called me a couple of times last week and I didn't accept it [NOISE] 'cause I was in the middle of something.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it called me like three times today and it couldn't find anyone.  I waited on hold for awhile and it was looking --
L:  Yeah, it called me three t- 
R:  -- for someone.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- this was the third time.
R:  Oh, was it?
L:  That it called.  The first time I was on the phone, the second time I was picking my son up at the bus stop, so ...
R:  Oh [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't -- I was surprised they called back so soon 'cause it was just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, not even a half hour ago that they called --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the first time, so -- so, you just wait until they find somebody to talk?
R:  Yeah, it puts you on hold and then plays music and says it's looking --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for someone.
L:  Huh.
R:  And it came on a couple of times and said, "I'm still looking, do you want to keep holding" or whatever, but --
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  So, it wasn't too bad.
L:  And I wonder what the purpose is of us talking about going back in time?
R:  I know, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It made me think of that movie -- what was that movie?  Back to the Future.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Ah, yeah.  That really confuses me, like the whole time travel thing 'cause -- 
L:  Yeah, I don't know --
R:  -- I think about like ...
L:  I thought that's what we were going to talk about.  I was like, "But man, I don't know anything about that kind of stuff" --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm actually not interested in that as far as, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- science and all that kind of stuff --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- was concerned, so I was a little bit --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- curious how they -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how they work that, but ...
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Stuff that I regret -- I don't regret a whole lot.  It doesn't do any good to regret, but --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Ah, to go back and spend time with people or to do something differently.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess that would change the outcome --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of your --
R:  [NOISE] That's the important thing.
L:  Of your existence or whatever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  So [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Are we just supposed to talk until they tell us to stop?  I'm not really sure.
R:  I have no idea.
L:  I'll have to look --
R:  I -- 
L:  -- up my little piece of paper here.
R:  -- I actually set my timer and it says four more minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Just so that I would know because I didn't know if they come on or what they did.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I was just looking at my little piece of paper here to see if it said, ah, you know, what [several inaudible words] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as being.  Does it have my pin number on it or whatever --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, it says, "We ask that you speak on the proposed topic for at least eight minutes --"
R:  Oh.
L:  -- after the ten minutes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- has expired you will have the opportunity to leave feedback about the call".
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  So, I guess you have to talk for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at least eight minutes.  So --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- if you set the timer then we're [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we're pretty good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what was your husband's last name again?
R:  [NOISE] Brinkley.
L:  Brinkley.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he graduated in ninety one?
R:  I believe so.  I mean, I think he's either a year ahead of me --
L:  H-
R:  -- or behind me.  [NOISE]
L:  How old is he?
R:  But, I'm pr- -- I was ninety one, so he might have been ninety [NOISE].  He's thirty now.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  He's a little bit younger than my youngest brother then.
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause my youngest brother was born in seventy, so he's just about thirty three.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  Oh, that's so cool.
L:  Does he have any sisters or ...
R:  He had a older brother --
L:  Older sisters?
R:  -- named Chris who would have been four years ahead of him.  So, he probably graduated around eighty seven.
L:  Oh.  And what was your husband's n- -- what's your husband's name?
R:  Tim.
L:  Tim.  [NOISE]
R:  Yep.
L:  I'll have to ask my brother if he knows him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's just too weird!
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  How did you find out about this stuff?
L:  Um, have you seen the money in shopping dot com?
R:  Yeah.  Maybe that's what I was on.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- and they sent me an email.
R:  Okay.  [NOISE]
L:  They --
R:  Yeah, that might have been it.
L:  -- they asked me if I wanted to do it.  Because I've done some --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- mystery shopping and --
R:  Oh, have you?
L:  -- you know, I've done some of those.  Yeah, it's actually kinda fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've done some of the easier ones.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  Um ...
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the -- you know, I did some, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ones for, like, Subway and, ah ...
R:  [NOISE] Oh, cool. 
L:  Did some for a bank and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I just actually did some for a bank, yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah ... stuff like that.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Easy money.  You just go in and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, act like you would normally act, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, I was so nervous because they say you're --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not supposed to be spotted, and they can tell and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all this sort of stuff --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I was a little bit, ah --
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, apprehensive about it at first because I thought, you know, I would look too obvious but ...
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  I took my daughter with me and I thought that would look, you know ...
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Less conspicuous if I went in there with my annoying little child with me, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's funny.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- I have -- I wasn't that ner- -- we get some that were bowling [NOISE].  Go to a bowling alley and buy food from the snack bar --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and bowl a few games.  But, it's kind of like we had a date out. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, really.  You get paid to go out on a date.
R:  Yeah, it was pretty good -- 
L:  I -- I got, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one that I could of done this last weekend.  Ah, it was to the Melting Pot, which is a --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- fondue kind of a restaurant.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But they only pay you, um, fifty dollars --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and the bill can be anywhere from eighty to hundred.
R:  [NOISE] Ooh.  [LAUGH]
L:  And my husband lost his job last week, so -- 
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  -- we kinda went, "Well, no, we can't do that".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  So I had to email --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- her back and, you know, apologize to cancel 'cause I didn't -- I don't like to have to cancel 'cause ...
R:  Right.
L:  They don't like that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um, but I -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, she was like, "Oh, I totally understand.  No problem.  Don't worry about it" --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- so, they were cool about it so ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --
L:  -- mostly if I get ...
R:  -- what does your husband do?  Like, what's his field?  [NOISE] 
L:  Ah, well, he used to work at bowling.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, dear.
L:  But he got laid off last year from there --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- and then, ah, he was just working for, um, a dairy doing some truck driving, and it just didn't work out, so ...
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  Now, we're --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we're shopping for jobs!  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. Yeah, right --
