R:  Well, my name is Mike and I'm from Chi- Chicago area.
L:  Hello Mike.  My name is also Mike and I'm from, um, Probo[?], Utah
R:  Okay, well that -- you know, in any group of five people there'll have to be at least two Mikes.  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Pretty common name.
R:  So, I think if I could go back in time I would want to have a different name, something a little less common.
L:  And why's that?
R:  Ah, well, you know, there's just too many Mikes, so I end up getting called by my last name a lot which is, you know, okay but, ah, it'd be nice to have something a little more, ah, a little more distinctive, you know, maybe, ah, Flash or, ah, you know, ah, Schwarzenegger or something else like that, you know, a- a- a- a little more zip to it.
L:  A little more -- maybe less common.
R:  Yeah, maybe a little less common.
L:  So, if you had to pick one name exactly, um, which of those names do you like the best?
R:  Ah, you know, I don't really know.  That's a -- that's a funny thing.  Ah, let's see, maybe I'll -- I'll think of something by the time we get to the end.  I'll a- I- I'll give you a turn right now -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- maybe I'll think of another name.
L:  Um, what would I change?  Well, I kinda like my name so I would keep my name.
R:  Okay.
L:  I might have been, um, if I could go back and change something -- maybe more active in my youth.  Um, more, um, um, especially outgoing.  I, er, I was more socially outgoing later on, um, as I got into, um, end of highschool and college but I would have been more -- more active, um, with groups maybe I -- when I was younger.  I think, um, what I know now, if I could've applied it then, um, I could have had a lot more, um -- maybe a lot more experiences.  So -- 
R:  Yeah, I kinda feel the same way.  Like it -- it took me a long time to get any social skills whatsoever.  Ah, well, maybe not that bad but, yeah, I was really quiet and intro- introverted when I was a kid.
L:  Yeah, that's -- I think that's what I'd change the most 'cause, um, being an introver- I mean I wouldn't consider myself an in- introvert by any means now, but I was more when I was younger and I think being more extroverted I could -- I would have had a lot more funny probably.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe not so much academic but a little bit more -- more excitement I think.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Let's see.  What else would I have done differently?  I don't think I would have done that many things differently if I would have gone back in time.  I think I would have, ah, I think I would have tried harder to get on the highschool basketball team but, ah, yeah, it wouldn't have made any difference longterm anyway.  I still would have been a bad basketball player.
L:  [LAUGH] If I'm going to go towards, um, sport -- I played nine years of baseball and blew out my knees and I gave up baseball instead of having my knees redone and giving it one more try.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I'd been, um, looking at the costume in town and had a great coach and I didn't want to push it any more with my bad knees.  And probably I would have, ah, changed things.  Maybe not played catcher for so many years and tried a different position so I didn't blow out my knees.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe -- I still would have been pretty small in size compared to a lot of the ball players but to have tried to live that dream would have been great.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  That's the other thing they got a- you know, the knee surgery is a lot better now than it was, ah, you know, certainly when I grew up.  Ah, so I guess they can repair them a lot better now too.
L:  Yeah, they don't have to make such big cuts on your knee.
R:  Yeah.  My nephew had knee surgery.  I don't know exactly what he had -- he had some sort of meniscus problem and, ah, you know, he went in, there was outpatient.  They did a little laproscopic thing and he was shoveling snow the next day although I don't know that that was such a good idea.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, ah, you know, it's really amazing what they can do now.  You know, it use --
L:  No.  If you could change anything else what would you do?
R:  Ah.  You know, I think if I could change something else I think I would have taken more math.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, you know, I make a living as a statistician now.  But, it's kinda funny 'cause I don't really, ah, you know, while I'm a professional statistician and belong to the, you know, the organizations, I didn't really take that much maths in college.  Um, I was n- but nobody ever asked about that and, you know, I always, ah, I have people who do the integrations and that.  You know, the hard stuff for me.  I just kinda pretend, ah, you know -- well, yeah, I used to know how to do that stuff but actually I never did.  But, um, so, you know, that's funny.  Of course I tell my daughters that and they just laugh --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- "No, you don't really want more math dad, you're just making that up".
L:  I think a lot of people try to avoid maths.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, yeah a -- a -- a little more would have come in handy.  So, yeah, I think -- I think I would have done that.  But, ah, you know, I don't have a lot of regrets.  Ah, you know, there's a -- a girlfriend or two who I think I wouldn't have broken up with, but probably would've broken up with them anyway or -- or if not, you know, it turned out okay, um, you know.  Been married twenty seven years to the same woman and, you know, that- that's just fine but, you know -- 
L:  That's great.  Congratulations.
R:  -- there -- there are things that you regret along that line.  Um, so, I wish I'd done more travelling.
L:  Definitely.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, so I'm looking forward to when I retire in maybe eight years or so to, ah, doing a lot of travelling.  Hopefully I'll -- 
L:  That's, um -- I -- I -- I tend to have the same thing.  I -- I keep putting off a trip to Italy for almost a decade now.  I've planning to do that and it's always the next graduation or the next job opportunity we'll -- we'll take off and -- or after the next child and then it becomes even harder.  [LAUGH]  And now I'm afraid we'll never -- we'll never go on that big trip we've been planning.
R:  Well, maybe not never, you know, there- there's a -- you gotta, you know, there's decades to live ahead so, you know, Italy will probably still be there.  We're not at war with Italy yet.
L:  [LAUGH] Who knows -- who knows we will be in the -- in the -- even in the far future.
R:  Um, yeah, you can never tell.  We're going to pick off countries one at a time --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- just kind of -- so -- so, ah, Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia and there we are right at Italy.  But, you know, somehow I don't think we'll get to Italy.  But --
L:  No.  Ah, we couldn't -- we couldn't go to war with them.  We enjoy their food too much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They've invaded our culture too much. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll get some bad pasta or something.  Ah.  Gosh.  I should think of more things that I regret.  How about you?  You got anything else here?
L:  Um, well, my wife is, um, is a professor of literature and now that I look at it I wish I'd read a lot more of the great classics -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it would make my conversations with her a little bit deeper and I feel a lot of time my conversations are superficial.  Ah, my knowledge of the -- the good classics ideal is in the end, Dante's works.  All those -- those -- those great books of literature and now I'm having to catch up real fast just so that I can, um, carry on, um, meaningful conversations in her discipline.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I wish that I had just had more interest in that so that I would've come out across as less sports, which I wouldn't give up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but I wish would've spent a little more time paying attention to the -- those literature.
R:  Yeah.  I wish I remembered some of those books --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R: -- 'cause, ah, I, ah -- oh, one year I didn't have much to do one summer 'cause I couldn't find a good job for a while.  This was when I was in highschool.  So, I got a college reading list.  And I didn't know that nobody ever read those things ahead of time.  They just passed out the list and said you should read these in highschool.  I didn't know nobody ever did that.  So, in, ah, one summer I read like sixty -- sixty books a day.  Not -- I mean, sixty books in the summer.
L:  Wow.
R:  All off the college list.  Ah, you know, I read the Aeneid, I read the Odyssey, ah, you know, ah, a whole bunch of nineteenth century British literature.  The problem is that, you know, when you read those things at the rate of, like, one a day practically, eventually they all kind've blend together.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Especially with all the British ones from the nineteenth century.  There's a -- there's like a British group and I can't remember what happens in what book.  And then there's a whole bunch of the Russian things.  Like I get Dead Souls and, ah, Crime and Punishment and Brothers Karimov all kinda, you know, blended in.  I kinda forget what happened in what book.
L:  Understanding.  [LAUGH]  
R:  So -- so there- there's down sides to reading some of those too.
L:  That reminds me of, um, um, I had to take, um, a graduate exam, um, in an area that wasn't my speciality and it was on peninsula literature and I'd never had it taught to me but they wanted to know that I had the -- the brunt of that domain.  So -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I had assigned to me, um, one millenium of literature from -- from the, um, [inaudible] peninsula of Spain.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I didn't have very much background in -- in, um, Spanish literature at all and I got through it.  I read it all.  I read everything that they wanted.  All the major works in the two month period.  And I took the test.  Passed it.  Can't remember any of it now.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um, I don't know if I really enjoyed it too much because I had to read it to so fast and was forced to read it.  I, um, I enjoy reading things that I -- that I can, um, pick and choose and read at my own pace.
R:  Yeah, so this is your preliminary exam?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, oh that's -- here's a regret.  When I took my preliminary exam it involved, um, a large part of it involved Bayesian statistics.  You don't have to understand anything about Bayesian statistics.  It's just that, here's this guy Bayes and he has this branch of statistics named after him.  And the exam -- I turned in the exam.  It's about fifty pages long by the time I get done writing about it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then, um, when I was having the oral part of the exam, you know, I re-read the written part ahead and I real-
