L:  Hi.  My name's Harold.
R:  Hi, Harold.  I'm Lauren.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How're doing today?
L:  I'm doing great.
R:  Good.  Where you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from uh Cravitson[?], Georgia.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in uh Brunswick, Georgia.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH].  So, how's the weather in Brunswick?
R:  It's ... was cold and rainy this morning and now it's pretty nice, so.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's kinda um, uh, what's called gloomy here, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kinda muggy and everything, so ...
R:  Mm.  So, would you not talk to your best friend again?
L:  Um, that -- that's debatable 'cause you know, finan- -- finances are kind of tight right now, so, I don't think I would.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't think [LAUGH] I would.  That would be --
R:  Finances must be real tight or your best friend's not that good of a friend?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, see, really, I don't have a be- -- I don't really have any best friends right now anyway, so you know, I've been through a long, hard road with recovery and everything --
R:  Oh, recove- --
L:  -- so, I really don't have any best friends.
R:  Recovering from what?
L:  Uh, recovering from uh, drugs and stuff, you know.
R:  Mm.  That is --
L:  Alcohol, yeah.
R:  That's gotta be a tough road?
L:  Yes, yes, well, you think you have friends but when you get in trouble or -- or, you know, things happen, they're not there for you, so that's why I say that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, I have a fantastic best friend --
L:  Well, that's good, isn't it?
R:  and uh -- and I don't think I could uh give her up for a million dollars [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah and I [LAUGH] I don't blame you.  I used to have a lot of good friends 'til I was interested in the drug scene but ... you know what I'm saying?  So, now it's like, doing a dance and start loving myself again.
R:  Right.
L:  So, anybody that does drugs, especially crack cocaine, cannot love themselves.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... and that's what I've been going through but I'm trying to deal with it.
R:  Well, good for you then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that you've realised that and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you're moving on from that.
L:  It took years to realise but now I finally ... I guess the uh ... the past finally hit me in the face.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I had to deal with it.
R:  Yeah.  Well -- well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How --
L:  So, you got any pets?
R:  Um, I don't.  I've got a five month old baby, who --
L:  Oh, so you can't have pets.  I bet you're busy all the time, too?
R:  She does keep us pretty busy, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  I've --
L:  Yeah, my little sister just had a um ... a little boy a month ago and he was premature, a month early.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, now he's -- uh, he's doing fine.  He's nine mo- -- he's nine pounds now.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  But he weighed four pounds when he was born.
R:  Oh, gosh.  My baby was almost nine pounds when [LAUGH] she was born [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  Gosh.
R:  But, is he out of the hospital and ...?
L:  Oh, yeah, he's doing fine.
R:  Good.
L:  I saw him on Sunday.  We spent the whole day together.  He's just a bundle of joy.
R:  Ooh.  They --
L:  He really is.
R:  -- they will change your life, they really will.
L:  Yeah.  She -- she -- she keeps him dressed so cute and -- and smelling so good, I tell him he smells so good enough to eat [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].  That's what I tell my daughter all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm going to eat you up!
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, peop- um, children are a joy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  You don't have any of your own?
L:  No, I don't have any of my own.  [inaudible] I just -- um, I used to travel a lot, so ... you know, people should realize when -- when uh you travel a lot, you want to be spontaneous --
R:  Mhm.
L:  t-- that kids, um, that's why they have planned parenthood.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Oh, for sure.
L:  Because children don't make a choice, the parents make the choice to bring them into the world.
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  So, they should uh, ma- -- you know, plan their lives around that, you know, what's going on in their lives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And just no make any rash decision like that.
R:  Your life definitely changes once you have them.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  Everything --
R:  We used to be able to just pack up and go any time we wanted and now the packing up --
L:  [LAUGH]
R: -- takes a whole lot longer [LAUGH].
L:  So, you know what I mean when I say it 'cause --
R:  Oh, I know exactly what you mean!
L:  -- I like to just go and come when I get ready so, you know, children are not planned in my life but I'm thirty five and my -- my two sisters and -- they got enough kids for me, so ...
R:  Well, that's good.  At least you've got nieces and nephews that you can love on and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and appreciate.
L:  One niece and uh -- who was born on my birthday, August twentieth.
R:  Oh, ok--
L:  And uh, three nephews.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] -- and they're all close to you?
L:  They're all close to me.  They lo- -- they love their Uncle Harold and I love them too.
R:  Oh, that's sweet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can love 'em and give 'em back!
L:  That's right [LAUGH].  Send them home when I get [LAUGH] when they get on my nerves.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Wh- -- they rarely get on my nerves, though but they just uh -- they -- they really uh ... really well mannered kids.
R:  What ages are they?
L:  Eleven, uh six, three and one month old.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You've got a -- a good variety.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  My oldest sister, she's, ah, thirty four.  She had one kid and that -- she said that was enough for her and she uh ... she's a hair stylist, so she uh -- she travels all the time too but my little sister keeps [inaudible] she's a dental assistant and ... it's -- it's a close knit thing, you know?
R:  Well, that's nice to have all that family so close.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have they been real supportive for you?
L:  Oh, yeah, they have.  I've be- -- they've been through the good, bad and the ugly, they've been there for me.
R:  That's good, so I guess maybe -- maybe the hypothetical question should uh say, if you couldn't talk to a relative, instead of a best friend.
L:  No.
R:  How wo- -- how would that affect your decision?
L:  N- No, I wo- -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't take it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wouldn't take that for -- for a million dollars [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.  So --
L:  No, I wouldn't.
R:  That's probably a -- a better hypothetical --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- question for you.
L:  Yeah, because friends, you know, you can -- you -- you can accept friendship but you can't take family.
R:  Right.
L:  Family is, you know, it's closer than anything to me, so ...
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [MN]
R:  That's great, that they've been very supportive for you.
L:  Yes, yeah but I -- I was thinking, Sunday, you know, as I saw my little nephew and we was out [MN] in the yard playing and one of our um, family friends passed.  She's forty eight.  She had lung cancer.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I was saying, you know, everybody ... 'cause I'm a well known person.  Everybody likes me.  I make everybody laugh, I'm a clown.
R:  Mm [LAUGH]
L:  So ... I was just outside and enjoying the sunshine, Sunday, and uh ... that -- that's enough to -- to make me stay sober, looking at my nieces and nephews.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The way they have the unconditional love for me.
R:  Oh, well, that's great.
L:  So, that -- that's enough to keep me clean and sober.
R:  Good.  Well, you just need to think about that every time [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.  Every time I try to get persuaded because, you know, I'm ... I used to be a knucklehead about that, you know?  Just go somewhere and some e- -- I want to do what everybody else is doing, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and that's not a good thing anymore for me.
R:  Now, would you say it was because of the people that you were hanging around with?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Like I said, I thought I had friends, you know, but if -- if anybody's giving me drugs or ... or, you know, that's not a friend, if they were really concerned about your health and your wellbeing.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, that's not a friend, especially if they see you losing uh, you know, things that you worked hard for and they're not, you know, saying well, that's wrong, don't do -- don't give this away.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  Th- there's no friendship there at all.
L:  Right, no, so ... like I said, when I -- when everything ran out and everything was gone, then nobody was there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I w- -- I had to deal with this alone so that's the way I'm gonna be now, you know?  Just ... talk -- get closer to God and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- keep myself straight.
R:  Well, good.  You -- you sound like you're definitely on the right path.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It -- it took me years to get this way but I'm finally here because, like I said, at the meetings I went to, um, they said, how -- "If you do drugs or anything, you're not loving yourself.  That's l- -- committing slow -- a slow suicide".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... and that's true.
R:  Absolutely and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just -- it's selfish, really, when you --
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  -- start thinking about it and thinking about who you're leaving behind and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how -- how they have to deal with it.
L:  Mhm, that's r- -- that's, you know and that's what I thought about 'cause half the people that I saw when I was in treatment, uh, they couldn't come back, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was death.  There's three things.  It's treatment, jails or death.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know and ... it's just so ... [MN] you have to take -- I can't -- I take it one hour at a time, not one day.  That's how critical my -- my -- my using was.  I had to take it one hour at a time.
R:  Well, at least you realise that.  That's great.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Well, good.  Um ... trying to think, what else [LAUGH]!
L:  I know.  I [LAUGH] I'm trying to think of something else to say too [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH].  We've done pretty good, talking as strangers for a while [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah, I know, I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So uh, uh, y- -- so, you're a housewife now?
R:  I am, yeah.  I was a -- an interior designer.
L:  Really?  That's -- that's in my dream.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  I --
R:  -- It's fun.  It's a lot of fun.
L:  Oh, my god.  Ain't that ironic 'cause I wanted -- I was wanting to go back to school.  I started at the Artist of Atlanta, back in eighty six.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, like I said, I -- I just quit because I -- I other things [several inaudible words] more important.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I could kick myself in the teeth because I really l- like interior decorating.
R:  Well, it's never too late and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's -- it's a fabulous field.  It's -- it's a lot of fun to ...
L:  I know and I ... yeah, I know you meet a lot of interesting people, too.
R:  Mhm, you do.
L:  [MN]
R:  And we're um, you know, right by Saint Simon's Island and Sea Island and th- there's people --
L:  Oh, you're so lucky [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] people with a lot of money here, that --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that I get to play with their money, so ...
L:  Well, you're so lucky.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You remind me of um um, Will and Grace! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I love Grace to death!
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  I wa- --
R:  That show's great.  That's one of my favorites.
L:  Yeah, that's -- and Karen is so funny.  I -- Karen is just -- she's my girl, she's so funny.
R:  Mhm.  They say that a lot th- that they do on that show is improv.
L:  Well, they do a good job of -- with it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They really do 'cause I watch it every night [LAUGH].
R:  [MN].  Do you?
L:  Yeah, that's my show.
R:  [LAUGH].  Oh, that's a great show.
L:  Seven thirty and ten thirty, I watch it.
R:  Wh- when does it come on?  They -- they play re runs?
L:  Ye- yeah, they play the re runs.  They come on at seven thirty at night and ten thirty at night.
R:  And I haven't seen that.
L:  Yeah?  Yeah, I watch it every night on -- on -- WB is my channel.  That's the only channel I watch, really.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Oh, I'll have to look for that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I always look forward to it on Thursday nights.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  These days, with a five month old, staying up that late is getting tough!  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah because you nev- -- you never know when she's gonna wake up and want your attention.
R:  Yep.
L:  Or need your attention, rather.
R:  And so you gotta go to sleep when they go to sleep and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nine thirty's a little tough these days [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, that's good. I'm -- I --'cause I'm -- I'm -- I'm debating uh e- either going back for that or either um, m- massage therapy.
R:  Oh, that'd be great, too.
L:  'Cause that's a good field to get into.
R:  Mhm.  That's a great field to get into.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When you can make sixty, seventy dollars in an hour.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  You can't beat that.
L:  Because if -- if that's -- you know, I want to work for a company 'cause most people th- that I know work for themselves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if you get with a company or work for a doctor, you can make more money.
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That would be great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't know if I could do it.  I -- I don't think I could touch all over strangers [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  The th- -- I -- I can um, I'm used to that, you know what I'm saying, because um, I used to uh, do my family.
