L:  Hi, my name's Lisa.
R:  Hi.  My name is Sissya.
L:  Cecilia?
R:  Sissie ya.
L:  Sissie ya.
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Well, you want to start first, I mean, h- -- how would you change something if you went -- had the opportunity to go back into time?
R:  Huh.
L:  What would you change?
R:  I would probably change, ah, [SIGH] gee, that's a hard one.
L:  Not for me.  Do you want me to start [LAUGH]?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  This is a -- a cigarette smoker for me.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, because a couple of years ago my fiancee passed away, he had cancer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when he passed away, okay, let me just ah give you -- we lived together for five and a half years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then that last half a year, in March, m- -- the last day of March, I kicked him out of the house and, um, j- -- in May sometime, the end of May, I found out that he was in the hospital with cancer, from his son, I was on the in- -- on the -- online.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, so, you know, June the second he was admitted, August the second he died.  So, --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he wanted to come back and live with me and die, you know, he said he wanted to come back home.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, ah, so, of course, I carry a lot of guilt, I would have, I -- you know, if I had the opportunity to -- to go back into time and change anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know it would be that [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know.  I would not have, um, kicked him out, um, things would have been different.  If I knew that four months down the line he was going to not be here anymore, well, my goodness, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that's how I would have switched it, you know, if I am -- it's something that I really do wish I could do -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- go back into time.  If -- if anything for that.
R:  Exactly.  Okay.
L:  Your turn.
R:  All right.  Um, one thing that I wish I could change, actually, is spending more time with my family in the past and the reason why I say that is because I'm like the oldest female and I'm only twenty two, but my cousin, Vonnie, um, has eight children and she was on drugs and prostituting and now she has Aids, okay, and all of her children are split up except one, the grandmother was -- was able to adopt one girl and the rest of her kids have been adopted by other people, but they've, you know, been affected by that and I feel that if I were able to -- if I had time for my family the girls who were like fifteen and sixteen and seventeen wouldn't have kids now --
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  That's the way you think, though.
R:  Huh?
L:  That's the way you feel.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I -- I know that I can't really -- you can't really predict when somebody will have a child, you know, but having a child at like fifteen or sixteen, you're really not ready and it's more than just having a child, it's having sex -- unprotected sex period.
L:  So, okay, we get into this, um, this time capsule and you go back into that time, so how -- how far was -- would that be?
R:  Ooh, boy.  That would be about --
L:  When you feel that you could have changed -- that it could have mattered, you know, that you -- what you did or what you would do would matter and would be a change and it, you know, all this that happened with them would not hap- -- how, you know, what time frame was that, I mean, how many years back would you go?
R:  I would say seven.
L:  Seven years back?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Because --
L:  And --
R:  -- they were ignored, you know, all of my cousins were like pretty much ignored by everyone, so, you know, and -- and the poor cousins, who really could not afford to take them in, took them in.
L:  Well, you know, there was a -- a real movie, you know, a movie about H.G. Wells, who invi- invented the, um, you know, the time -- the -- the time capsule that allowed you to go back into time, right --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I don't know if you saw it, but, um, there was a -- a detective Sherlock Holmes who was after the -- wait a minute, I forgot how it went, anyway, what the gist of the story was that he really couldn't change time, even though he went back or forward, he -- whatever is going to happen is destined to happen.
R:  Exactly.  I believe that.
L:  You know.  So, that's, you know, I mean, it's not -- it's a nice thought that -- to think about going back, I mean I could even say that I wanted to go back into, um, the time when Jesus walked the earth --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I would have loved to have --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- met him and to --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- right, and to see how I would have responded, would I -- would -- would I have been one of the people that said, "Oh, this guy is a lunatic"?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know.  Because here I think, oh, you know, I believe in God and Jesus as the Lord and all of this, but had I lived in those times, would I have thought that he was some lunatic?  You know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right.  Or w- w- --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Or would we have believed him?  And been one of his followers.
R:  That's a good question.
L:  [MN] You know.  I mean, would you -- how would you, knowing how you are, and you took that time capsule back, and you saw this guy walking around and saying that he's the Son of God or doing all these miracles, would you have continued to follow him out of curiosity or as a believer?
R:  Hm.
L:  Right?
R:  Goodness, that's a good question.  Yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, you know, they were really ridiculed back then for that.  You know.
L:  Yes.
R:  The followers of Jesus and things like that, you had to really be a strong person --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- to have done that and really had believe and not just have been curious, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I think that was a time when, you know, ah, there was a lot of prejudice at -- you know, prejudice stems a long, long time back.
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  You know.  It -- it's never ended really they just kind of -- I feel that it's camouflaged now, it's hidden.  But --
R:  And there's something else I wish I could have changed because --
L:  Sure, you know.  I mean --
R:  -- I should say it.
L:  -- how many people died?  How many slaves were lynched?  I live in Florida now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I -- I'm from New York, though, but every now in then, I say, geeze, you know, I can feel it -- I can --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and I can see it, but it's still alive and well in the south --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but then in New York it was still alive and well, too.  But b- -- living here makes me remember certain things that happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so I mean, of -- us going back in a time capsule, could we really make a difference if all of us, I mean if say fifty percent of the world had that chance to travel back in a time capsule and -- and travel back into time to these certain periods --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- could we have changed anything?  You know.  I mean, I'd like to believe, yeah, knowing what we know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- now --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, not just going back and being dropped off anywhere, but knowing what we know now and experiencing what we've experienced, I think we could.
R:  Right.  Given the opportunity, I probably think I would try, you know.
L:  Would you leave what you have to go back if you couldn't take anybody else with you but yourself and what you know?
R:  Yeah.  I would.
L:  I would, too.  I'm um -- I'm an adventurer that way.
R:  Me too.  But this is also something that I've -- that I've thought about before, you know --
L:  To go back?
R:  -- with all -- with that time machine movie that came out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I was wondering how we could actually -- how all that will come about and what I would actually do if I was in that situation.
L:  I would love it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I would love it because there's so much h- -- so much has happened since I was a child -- and I'm forty seven years old now, right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so much has happened.  Being from New York, I saw those towers go up --
R:  Exactly, oh, god.
L:  -- and living here in Florida, I saw them come down [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- on the news and, I mean, how could I h- -- how could I change that.  If I took a, you know, if I took a time capsule back into time --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- how could I change it, if anything.  You know, I mean, would I stay in New York?  Would I try and warn people because I know about, you know, I'm going back with this knowledge --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- how could I warn people and not sound like a lunatic, or not sound like a terrorist --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- who -- who was part of it all, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's, you know, it's real sketchy, the whole thing is real iffy, I mean, you could be a real good [inaudible] person who knows all of this because we live here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if we went -- we traveled backwards with all these answers, what -- you know, they probably -- the authorities would have us --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  The FBI would have us, or they'd stick us in a padded room and then when it did happen, we'd be in hot water --
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know.  So ...
R:  Because, you know, Americans, I mean, well, people in general, I think we like to be warned but I don't think we can handle it.
L:  No.
R:  You see what I'm saying?  I mean, with -- with -- with psychics, you know, I don't know if they exist or not because nobody's ever told me anything but, you know, I'm -- I'm sure there's some- -- there's something out there is like that but, you know, just like you were saying, people don't know how to handle that.  You tell somebody something like that and everybody will go crazy.
L:  Yeah.  Time travel, hey, listen, you know, I just heard --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I -- I just, um, I got this big box in the mail and we can go back into time with it.  You want to come?  What --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- year do you want to go -- remember that movie, Back into Time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] with the car --
R:  Yes.  Back to the Future.
L:  You know, I mean -- Back to the Future.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was -- I thought that was a great movie.  
R:  Yeah, it was.
L:  I was really interested in that.
R:  That was.
L:  Because there's so much that
