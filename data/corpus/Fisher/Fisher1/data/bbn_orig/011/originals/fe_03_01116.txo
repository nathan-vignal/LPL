R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  This is, ah, Craig [inaudible].
R:  Oh, this is Susan [inaudible].  Um --
L:  S- --
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm pretty good.  How are you?
R:  Oh, I'm okay.
L:  Right.  How's the weather in Pennsylvania?
R:  Well, I'm not in Pennsylvania, I'm in Colorado.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  [COUGH] Pardon me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, yeah, we're expecting to get a storm; it hasn't gotten as far as us yet, but they're planning on it, so --
L:  Oh, I see.  Boy it's windy here.
R:  Yeah, well, that's -- spring is often windy isn't it?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] We're the wind city.  Next to Chicago [LAUGH].
R:  Is that where you're at, Chicago?
L:  No, I- -- I'm in [inaudible] Texas --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but it's always windy here, too [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah, Pennsyl- -- I think Pennsylvania's where the study's centered, but the people are from all over the place.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I don't understand what this is, um, um, m- -- I got an email from a friend and, um, I haven't participated in it yet --
R:  [COUGH] Yeah, this is my first time, too, I think they must have started later than they were hoping to.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but I -- I think they just want to hear how people do conversations when they don't know someone kind of -- you know, some kind of a thing like that.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Uh-huh.  And, ah, so, um, you know, that's kind of an interesting topic, w- -- what would you change if you could -- or would you change -- go back in time and change something in your life?
L:  Oh, [MN] um, let's see, recently my mother died and, um, um, I didn't realize the last night that she was alive, ah, I didn't realize that she was able to understand things, I thought that she was comatose and I would have liked to have, you know, talked to her, even though it would have been a one way conversation and I thought that, ah, she was just --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- in a coma and I'd like to go back and be able to tell her that I really appreciated her as a mother.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that would -- yeah, I can see that -- that's a good thing, although you know, I'm sure that she'll know, you know, but -- but I can see that, ah, that would have been, you know, you would have felt to have been able to do something like that, but it's hard --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to deal with something like that.  My -- my dad kind of went the same way; he was in, you know, he was unconscious for, you know, two weeks before he actually passed on and it really, you know, [COUGH] sort of doesn't give you very much closure, you know, you kind of like, oh, okay, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, ah, it's, um, you know, I -- I used to work in nursing and I always felt like it was, you know, quite a bit harder actually on the families getting left behind, I'd kind of feel like the people who were moving on are going on to something new and better --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know, but it's just those of us who are without 'em now that -- that are the ones that actually have it worse [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, you know, you just have to kind of -- you have to kind of get along.
L:  Sure.  I've kind of deal with it, but, um, it would have just been nice to be able to go back to that time and been able to express myself, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there --
L:  But I'm glad that, you know, she's in a better place now.
R:  Pardon?  I'm sorry.
L:  I'm glad that she has, you know, ah --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- gone and she's in a better place.  She --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- never wanted to life, you know, if her quality of life wasn't good, so that's good that she has the best quality now [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I think --
L:  And you're in Colorado?
R:  Pardon?
L:  You're in Colorado [inaudible].
R:  Yes, I'm in Colorado, but I'm down in the south east, um, so I'm really not that far from Texas, only probably about, ah, one hundred and twenty miles from the border.
L:  I see, what city is it?
R:  Uh, it's Lamar.
L:  Lamar?
R:  Uh-huh.  I'm about -- I'm about four hours from Amarillo --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- it's the biggest Texas city and --
L:  I have a friend that has a cabin in Cuchara, Colorado and I used to go out there quite a bit.
R:  Yeah.  A lot of people have those neat little cabins and [inaudible] it's a lot of pretty things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That makes it -- makes it fun to be able to visit when -- when we come down there to vacation sometimes because my brother lives, um, near Dallas, so we come down there [LAUGH], so we kind of trade back and forth, I guess.
L:  I see.  You probably pass this way.
R:  Pardon?
L:  You probably pass this way quite a few times now.
R:  Could be, could be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] pretty close to Amarillo, so --
R:  Mhm.  That's true, it's not that --
L:  -- you know this part of the country, then [LAUGH].
R:  Well, yeah, and I would have, you know, pretty -- it's not unlike our's really, not that different, kind of flat, kind of windy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Kind of dry right now.
L:  Oh, man, it's real dry here.
R:  Yeah, we're -- we're --
L:  We could sure use some rain.
R:  We're expecting a pretty -- [several inaudible words] getting ready to get some, um, I mean it looked like, ah, this -- a pretty big system, they, ah, you may be in a couple of days.
L:  Yeah, we did have some rain, ah, ah possibility for rain forecast for tomorrow and the next day.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right now it's really nice out, but, um, this is supposed to be a pretty big one and the real big low, big slow moving storm and we might get as much as eight inches of snow by Wednesday, so ...  But that's spring for you, that happens sometimes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- late spring -- late spring blizzards.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They sure blow up.
L:  Do you get a lot of snow there?
R:  Uh, we have -- we've been in -- in drought conditions for quite a while and, you know, it's, ah, I don't think we've gotten more than a few inches [COUGH] over the winter for the last couple of winters --
L:  I see.
R:  -- and -- so, it would be nice to get, you know, we could sure use some.
L:  Yeah, we haven't even had much snow lately.  This year, anyway.
R:  Yeah.  It's been a pretty warm winter on the whole.  So, we're -- we're hoping to get -- because it's -- [inaudible] bad they're doing some, you know, real -- real severe water restrictions up in -- up [inaudible], you know, the big towns, Denver and -- and what not, ah, because they just don't have -- they just don't have it in the reservoirs.
L:  I see.
R:  And, ah, you know, so they're really -- they're talking about closing down the car washes and, um, you know, no new lawns and you can only water your lawn once a week and, you know, there's, ah --
L:  Oh, are they restricting water use?
R:  Yeah, because the -- it's just a really bad drought.  It was a bad drought year last year, you know, we had all those fires in the mountains.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Because it was so dry and now it's, ah, it's a little better this year than it was last, but not enough to really catch up.  We're still way, way down in -- in all the reservoirs and that's not good.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Not.
L:  That gets to be scary.
R:  Huh?
L:  That gets to be scary.
R:  Yeah, it does.  It does and, you know, here, where I live, it's ranching community, you know, and, um, you know, people had to get rid of a lot of -- a lot of their cattle because there's no -- no hay, you know --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- to winter them over and, um, you know, so that's -- that impacts people pretty bad for several years running if you've got to get rid of your -- your breeding herd.
L:  Does the [several inaudible words] aquifer pass through your area?
R:  We just -- we just touch on it.  We just touch on it --
L:  I see.
R:  -- um, that's -- that's more -- a little more north of us --
L:  I see.
R:  -- but, um, I think -- I think -- well, I think we're in like the edge, but, you know, there's restrictions on pumping, there's been restrictions on pumping out of that for a while, so --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- so, ah, because that -- because they had a water law changed and they had the -- they had to change a lot of that, so it's -- it's a time of change, definitely a time of change.  Uh [LAUGH] I don't know, we could use our trip back in time to say, "For crying out loud, stop building so many houses up in [MN] but no one would listen to us --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no one would listen to us, so that wouldn't help, I guess.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, yeah, I guess, ah, if we're -- we're supposed to kind of stay of topic, ah, um, the only thing -- I wouldn't really change any major things because, you know, that would, you know, then that would affect other things, you know, like you could say, well, my first husband was a jerk, but, you know, well, yeah, but then I would -- then I still like the kids that I have so I wouldn't want to change them [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, so, ah --
L:  How many kids do you have?
R:  Well, I have two that I -- two that I had and two adopted kids.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, we -- and three of them are grownups and one of them's eleven.  Because we kind of did a start over way late in life, but ... but, ah, you know, I think -- I think over, just overall, I would, you know, be you know do more stuff with the kids and try to be more patient with them because they were kind of wild and crazy kids and you know, I think -- I think stuff like that, just in general.  So, that kind of thing you really can't exactly go back and change, you know, all you can do is say, "Well, you're right.  I'm sorry, I was -- I was hard on you".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
