L:  Hello, call partner, my name is Wanda.
R:  Hi, Wanda, I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi, Debbie.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Boy, this is a good topic, here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  They got us on this one, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Trying to figure out if there's anybody that I like so much that -- that I wouldn't stop talking to 'em for a million dollars.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.  [LAUGH] Exactly.  I mean, maybe my husband, he would go first, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well ... he probably wouldn't --
R:  But ten million and I could live without him.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's awful.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And that is after twenty nine years, too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, but he'd probably get to have half the million when you get rid of him.
R:  Mm ... I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No ... don't know if I could give him the half.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, that is interesting though.  Um, I could do it.  How 'bout you?  [LAUGH]
L:  I think I probably could.
R:  And I think, if they were good e- -- if they were a good enough friend, they would understand that.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, it doesn't -- they didn't say you couldn't tell them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that was why you weren't talking to 'em.
L:  Yeah.  You just can't speak to 'em any more.
R:  Right.  You can write 'em a letter.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Unless this -- yeah, you know I'm --
R:  [MN] other than that, you could talk to 'em on internet.
L:  Uh-huh.  Unless it comes with a big long contract that says you can't email them and you can't send 'em letters --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I'd find a way around it.
R:  Well, I mean, if ... if they were -- I mean, if it was to say, you had to have no contact with them at all, I still think they would understand.  Send them a little of the money and they would understand.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ... were are you at?  What state?
L:  I'm in -- I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, wow and what --
L:  And where are you?
R:  I'm in um, Georgia.
L:  Well, hello.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How's it going in Georgia today?
R:  Oh, it's beautiful, it's beautiful.  It's getting warm.
L:  Ooh.
R:  How 'bout there?
L:  Oh, yeah, we had a couple of days when it actually got into the seventies and now it's back down in the forties.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, it's cold and grey and ugly.
R:  You all have snow?
L:  We still have snow, yeah.
R:  Ever ... oh, you do?
L:  Yep.
R:  I've seen snow once in my life.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  Well --
R:  I mean [MN] in my own home.
L:  Uh.
R:  Like, [SIGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, you're welcome to some of ours.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, it's kinda fun, you know, like, once in a while but people -- people here don't know how to drive.
L:  That's true.
R:  Okay.  I don't know how much we're supposed to talk on this.
L:  We're supposed to talk for eight minutes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right, it's --
R:  This is my first time, so ...
L:  Yeah, it's mine too.  They keep trying but I haven't ever been here.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yes, me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then my password was wrong.
L:  Well, yeah, I did that too.  Yesterday when they called, I -- I did the wrong pin number.
R:  Yeah, but they gave me the wrong pin.  I kept punching it in.
L:  Oh.
R:  So I called back um ... they had me registered twice.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Okay but anyway, let's see.
L:  Yeah, we're just --
R:  Best friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, my best friend isn't here anyway and, you know, I don't talk to her as often -- I mean, we know we're there for each other, mates --
L:  Right.
R:  Even if -- even if we don't ever talk, you know.  I mean, and we went a long time, over a year without um, even writing.
L:  Right.
R:  But I knew she was still my best friend, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a woman that I guess I would consider her my best friend and she's -- she lives in Washington, so I haven't seen her in years and every now and then, we'll go a very, very long time, you know, without uh, emailing or anything.
R:  But I think that if they were a good enough friend, they would understand a million dollars.
L:  Yeah.  You could always go find another friend.
R:  Well ... but even that -- I mean, if they're your best friend, I mean, I think, if it was me -- if it was somebody, my best friend and they couldn't talk to me because they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a million dollars and not talk to me, I would understand, you know, and I would feel happy for them -- for her.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Especially if she sent some money!
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But if you never -- if you could never talk to 'em again, um, I just -- I um ... you know, I don't think I'm shallow either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I just don't think that's shallow.  I think that a friend understands, I mean, stipulations like that.
L:  Well, I think, in my case, I just don't really have, you know, incredibly close friends.  I have --
R:  Right.  I don't think any of us do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, we're in a -- the environ- -- a different environment now.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean ... the wor- -- uh, do you work?
L:  Um, I'm unemployed right now.
R:  Okay.  Are -- are you usually a worker?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  See w- -- and so am I.  I mean, I've worked for twenty eight years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I got sick and I've been home nine months now but I still don't, you know, I -- I still don't take ... you know, go out with people and ... you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's just ...
L:  Me neither.  In fact one of the things, when I lost my job, one of the -- one of the biggest problems was that the majority of people in my life that I talked to and, you know, felt close to, were people that I worked with.
R:  Exactly, me too.
L:  And now, that I wasn't going to work, I never saw them any more and, you know, with very, very rare exception, never heard from them again.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, which is kinda worse 'cause then you really feel cut off.  You not only don't have a job, you don't have all of your friends either.
R:  But I think the word "friend" has changed since our gener- -- in our generation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the baby boomers.
L:  Well -- yeah --
R:  Because our families v- [NOISE] ... our fa- -- our parents' best friends, you know, and then, my mother never worked.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my dad, you know, they -- actually, he was in the army, so his friends were in the army too.
L:  Right.
R:  But [SIGH] um ... I just -- you know, I think that we're all mature enough to understand that.  Now, maybe when we get in our seventies or eighties, we might say different.
L:  Yeah.  Well, and there are those people, too, who have a friend they grew up with and you know, stayed close to through high school and college and ... but uh, I don't know.  That's just not me.
R:  Well, my friend is one I grew up with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we ... we moved um -- we- -- I was in Augusta, Georgia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's where I grew up and then when I was thirteen, we moved to Charleston, South Carolina and, you know, she is still -- I mean, I haven't -- I haven't seen her but once since thirteen.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, we haven't written each other in over a year but if anybody said, "Who's your best friend?" I would have to say her.
L:  Yep.  Well, then you wouldn't have it too tough.  [LAUGH]
R:  Where -- where did you work?
L:  I worked for Fox Television.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.  What did you do?
L:  I was a programming assistant.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, I was just an old secretary. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?  Unfortunately, since there's not a lot of TV jobs, I'm looking for an old secretary job right now but ... and it's -- it's hard because, well, in the first place, there aren't a lot of 'em, but it just seems so incredibly boring to me, to be working for, you know, just ... a company that makes widgets and you do paperwork and stuff and ...
R:  Right.  Well, and that's kinda your -- I'm kind of, like, exactly where you said, you know?  [LAUGH] Um, when I ... we -- my -- we're -- my husband and I are both part of a base closure ... um, in Charleston.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And ... um, they just basically closed down and said, "Everybody go wherever you could" --
L:  Ooh.
R: -- and with so many years' service, we were both at twenty five years, he had to um, find the closest base to Charleston to be able to keep his job.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that was here.  Well, I was um ... the public affairs officer there in Charleston.
L:  Mhm.
R:  At this navy base and I loved it.  [LAUGH] It was -- and I'd pr- -- finally worked my way up out of the secretarial field, you know, and proven myself to get this really good job and [SIGH] then [LAUGH] finally, we took a cut and they closed us down, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that happened and then I had to ... um, find anything, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  Which meant going back to being a secretary.
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  And the closest thing I could find was in Jacksonville, Florida and w- -- and that's about an hour from where my husband, you know, [inaudible].
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So ... we have our house in Charleston. [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And we're renting here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And we only owe three or four years on the house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... and, you know, here, I'm not into my employment.  I mean, being a secretary, just like you said, I mean, sitting there typing and ...
L:  It's just a job, yeah.
R:  Paper -- yeah, exactly.
L:  I know.
R:  Exactly.  It's just a job.
L:  Oh, I hate to settle for a job --
R:  It's not something you really want to do for life.
L:  Right.  I just -- I -- oh, I dread just getting a job.
R:  But I think that had a lot to do with me getting sick, you know?  Because ... you know, it was just so ... I think I was depressed at first and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I had had some gyn type problems and, you know, they just kept on and [SIGH] ...
L:  Yep.
R:  I just didn't have anything, really, to go to work for.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  And I was really disappointed and pissed by the government too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  But anyway, we're -- we're struggling because we have two house payments and two rents -- I mean, two electric bills and two of everything and we're still on the same income as we were before.
L:  Oh.
R:  But now, I'm out of a job.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, gee.
R:  So, I'm kind of with you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've been unemployed for nine months.
L:  Yeah.  I've been unemployed for, I think it's five months now.
R:  Well, I'm waiting for ...
