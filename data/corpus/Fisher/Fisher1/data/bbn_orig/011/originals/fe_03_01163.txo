R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi -- 
L:  My name is Bill.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  My name is Martha.
L:  Hi, Martha.
R:  So, what would you do if you could change something back in your time?
L:  If I could change something back in my time I think it would have been when I was younger.  My decision not to go to, um, higher education in college -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, what about you?
R:  Um, I think probably the decision I took to move to Hawaii.  And soon after my dad passed away, and I never got to see him.
L:  Are you from Hawaii?
R:  Ah, no.  I'm from Spain.
L:  Oh, you're from Spain.
R:  Yeah, well, yeah.  [several inaudible words] yeah, I'm from Spain -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so, I was, ah, in Hawaii when that happened and, ah, the -- I guess that's what I would change.
L:  Oh.  Was it -- has that been something that you've carried as far as the thought for all your life?  I mean, has there been a regret?
R:  Um, no, not really.  I thought about it now that they say, "What would you change" -- 
L:  Yeah, but is -- is -- that's exactly what happened with me.  It's like, um, I'd decided that what the decision I'd made in my life was okay, um, and it came up when the question came up.  But, I sorted thought, "Well, you know, I can't go back in time to change it.  So, it's something that I just have to exist with".
R:  Mhm.  What do you do instead?
L:  Um, instead I was -- I was raised in, um, in Chicago and there's a strong, um, industrial, um, workforce in Chicago, not -- not the intelligentsia, n- not the, um, um, college crowd so to speak -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I came from a very blue collar family and the concept was find a good company, go to work for them, and retire from the company.  Well -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] that was, you know, back in the fifties and the sixties.  That's the way the world was in America.  Um, today we don't live in that world and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you -- you can't find a company to go to work for and retire from and the companies don't take care of the employees the way they used to either.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, in that regard, um, I've -- I regret not going to school to learn more of something more than just blue collar work.
R:  Mhm.  But, you can, ah, still go to work, right?
L:  Yes.  Yeah, I mean, it's -- it's something that obviously if it was a mistake that I made, it -- it, ah, it's something I could -- I could correct if I chose to -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is not in the same as your situation.
R:  Ah, yeah.  [LAUGH]  That's a little harder to change, ah, but -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- yeah.  [inaudible] -- 
L:  So, you moved -- you moved from, um, you moved from Spain to Hawaii?
R:  Yes.  I am a teacher at the university here.  So, I moved here to work at the University of Hawaii.
L:  Ah.
R:  About ten years ago.
L:  About ten years ago?
R:  Yes.
L:  Th- that's amazing because Hawaii is the one place in the world where I'm trying to move to!  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- my first trip to Hawaii was in nineteen eighty two and I have, um, y- you know, talk about going back in time, um, that -- when I stepped off the plane it was like I had arrived home -- I never had -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a feeling ever like that.  And subsequently I've been back, um, eight or nine trips since then, and I just -- I absolutely fall apart when I leave.
R:  Oh, well then, maybe you belong here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It -- it must be, yes.  And -- and I suppose if I could go back in time, maybe because it hurt so much to leave, then maybe I should never have -- 
R:  Maybe you should --  
L:  -- gone to Hawaii.
R:  -- have stayed the first time.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] Very good.  How long do we have to talk on this?
L:  Ah, ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes.  Okay.  I'm not keeping track, are you?
L:  Um, yeah, it looks like we have about -- maybe about another five.
R:  Okay.  Well, ah, what kind of job do -- what kind of, um, work do you do?  What did the -- are you sure to find something in Hawaii?
L:  Um, actually, no.  Because it -- um, I've spent my entire life working in, um, um, in- industrial.  Ah, I was a purchasing agent in the --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- electronics company I was, ah, um, a QC manager -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, managing for -- for quality control and so forth.  But, the problem in -- in southern California is that all of that industry basically is gone.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there's very little industry.  So, what mostly supports the economy in -- in southern California is, um, ah, at least for people who don't have, ah, a higher education, is retail.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's very, very much like -- like Hawaii.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, ah, being a tourist based industry -- 
R:  Mhm -- 
L:  -- um -- 
R:  -- service based.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep.  Well, you can do the same kind of job from here -- I mean from there here, if you open a [LAUGH] you know -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a branch of your business or something like that.
L:  What -- 
R:  It's hard though, I mean to -- to -- 
L:  What's very -- what's very difficult is the a- a- of which you would know very well is, like, when do you pull up the roots -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that you've had in a place --  
R:  Yes.
L:  It's very difficult to do that.
R:  It is.  It is.  You have to be -- 
L:  Um.
R:  -- there's a few times in your life when you're in those transition -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] and that -- that's the only time to do it.  That's sure.  That, ah, that's hard to do, you know, to move, you know, when you have a job and a stable, you know, family or friends or it is really hard to give up everything and say, "Well, you know, I'm just moving".  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  It is hard.
L:  It seems to m- is my entire life has brought me to the w- ah, towards, the west.  Um, being raised and born in Chicago and moving, um, to California was some of my relatives.  So, we would come out to California and visit them.  And I always loved California so when I would go back home I'd feel homesick -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but nothing like the feeling that I have, ah, ah, getting further west being -- being -- being in Hawaii -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Um.
R:  It's [several inaudible words] very interesting because, ah, a lot of people have that feeling when they come to Hawaii.  People that come to work at UH for example, the University of Hawaii, it's either they hate it, just the first week when they arrive, the say, "This is not for me" or they thoroughly fall in love with it.
L:  Mm.
R:  There's no inbetween.  It's -- it's very extreme how people feel about the island and it's very interesting.  I don't think it happens very often anywhere else.  You know, you can like somethings, dislike others, but here it's -- it's very extreme.  It's either you fall in love and you think, you know, "This is where I belong" -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or -- or it's like, "I'm out of here, this is a rock".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Which, ah, which campus do you work at?
R:  Minoa.
L:  Oh, no, you're kidding?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's my favorite valley.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I love, um, I could love going up to Lion Arboretum -- 
R:  Uh-huh, yes.
L:  -- and the height going back to Minoa Falls.
R:  Mhm, yes.
L:  And the o- the -- the tearoom -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for lunch over there.
R:  Mhm, yeah, well you know it!  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well yeah.  Every -- well, everytime I come to Hawaii it's, um, usually I try to come in for two weeks -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I rent a condo, um, usually in Waikiki 'cause they're the cheaper ones.  But, you know -- 
R:  Yes, and there's -- 
L:  -- I'd really prefer to be over -- 
R:  -- more availability too.
L:  -- I'd -- I'd really be -- prefer to be over by Kailua[?] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, but I stay there for two weeks and I get my bus pass for two weeks and I'm out of -- I'm out of Waikiki.  Waikiki is usually just where I lay my head to go to sleep but I'm -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm everywhere else.
R:  Yeah, like most people that live there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's what the many locals do to.  You know, they live there but their lives are somewhere else.  You know, they work somewhere, they go to the beach different places.  Yep.
L:  Yeah, it's a -- it- it's -- you just -- I -- I love the people and I love the, um, the whole island, ah, lifestyle of being able to -- I think the concept of knowing that people are on a rock in the middle of the ocean, um, there's something along with the aloha spirit that says, "We have to get along" and people do.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes -- 
L:  And it -- 
R:  -- there's nowhere to run to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, it's, ah, it- it's -- it's like I said, my fav- favorite place in the world, um, but that is not something that I would, um, regarding our question about time and what we would have done differently, um, I don't want to finish my life having that regret of not moving to Hawaii.  So, the time will come and it will be -- it will happen.
R:  Very good -- 
L:  Um, and I expect to -- 
R:  -- not a bad place to retire either.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, not at all.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I think we've -- may have come up to ten minutes.
R:  I think so, ah -- 
L:  I -- 
R:  -- at least five from what you said, it was five left.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it -- it looks like we may have forgotten.  Um, I -- oh [several inaudible words] I see your time [inaudible].  So, you're three hours -- three hours behind us?
R:  I -- 
L:  A-
R:  -- am three hour, yes.  [inaudible] you are in California, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  Three hours then.
L:  So, it's three hours.
R:  It's, ah, seven forty one now.
L:  Oh, yeah, 'cause it's -- 
R:  Here. 
L:  -- it's, um, nine forty one.  Oh, no, so you're only two hours.  It's nine forty one here.
R:  Oh, yeah, because now we're going -- yeah, yeah, it's summer -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  There it is, that little change in there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Very good. 
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, nice talking to you.
L:  Very nice talking -- 
R:  And I hope --  
L:  -- to you.
R:  -- you, ah, move to Hawaii.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I hope -- yes, and I hope our paths may -- may cross again.
R:  But -- maybe, maybe -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- who knows.
L:  Who knows. 
R:  Bye bye.
L:  Bye.
