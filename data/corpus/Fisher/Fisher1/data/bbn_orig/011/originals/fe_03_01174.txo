R:  Hi, I'm Julie.
L:  Hi, I'm Jody.
R:  How're ya doing?
L:  I'm doing pretty good.  How 'bout you?
R:  Good, good.  What do you think about this big --
L:  I wouldn't.
R:  No chance.
L:  No chance because --
R:  No ch-
L:  You know, my best friend is my very best friend [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Went through a lot in these last several years and my best friend just happened to be, like, there always.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She was a rock and you just can't buy that.  You -- no amount of money can buy that.
L:  No, 'cause uh, mine came over ... uh my very best friend came over Friday to spend the night with me and my family and she brought her four kids and when I held onto her it was like, [SIGH] -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, I just needed a Stephanie hug and that's what we say, you know.  She needs a Jody hug or I need a Stephanie hug and it was world saving, honestly [LAUGH] so I --
R:  That is --
L:  -- so, I would have to say, there's no way I would take the money.
R:  I know.  I now live next to my best friend.  We lived a couple of houses apart before and she moved away, not far but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the far enough where we weren't in that day to day contact and --
L:  [MN] Oh, that's so weird 'cause see --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Stephanie and I lived beg- -- beside each other for ten years or -- and then, now we live two hours apart instead of two houses apart.
R:  Oh, you're kidding!
L:  No.
R:  [MN]
L:  And so it's really hard [LAUGH].
R:  I can -- I can only imagine.  She called one day and said, "Oh, they just posted a sign in the house next door" 'cause I have four kids too.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "And, it's gone.  I called round before blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm like, well, we're not moving.  We just tore apart our kitchen!  Well, thirty one days later, there we were, but ...
L:  Oh, wow, wow --
R:  She's priceless.  She's just priceless.
L:  Yeah.  That's how I feel about Stephanie.  She's uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  I tell her all the time, you know, just -- I told her -- I kept telling her, "Thank you" the other day 'cause I just really needed her and uh ...
R:  Ooh.
L:  It was wonderful for her and the kids to come over.  I was just like, [SIGH].  My in laws were watching me when I was hugging 'er bye when she had to leave and I said, "The only reason I'm not crying is 'cause she's coming over Friday" 'cause I have a pampered chef coming on Friday --
R:  Uh-huh --
L:  -- and then she called me, um, the other day and she goes, "Jody, I have bad news.  I can't come on Friday" and so I started crying.  I was like --
R:  Ooh --
L:  Ooh --
R:  Didn't you cry? [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  I was looking for you [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Ooh.
L:  But ...
R:  Oh, I know.  I mean, what  [MN] --
L:  See, this is the first time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I've actually got to come in 'cause I didn't have a pin number and so they finally --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I called 'em over the weekend and I said, "Please give me a pin number because ah ... I can't get in anywhere, you know".
R:  Ooh.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, I think this is kinda fascinating and then I'm like, "I love to talk to people" so --
L:  Well, see, I do too, I'm a talker and a half.
R:  So, where are you from?
L:  Ah ... Sante Fe, Texas.
R:  Oh, I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And how would a million dollars do you if ... in your area where you're at?
L:  How would a million dollars do me right now?
R:  Yeah.  Wouldn't it like, pull you out of everything you're in?
L:  Oh, gosh. I have a seven month old grandson --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's livin with us, you know, her an- -- him and my daughter are both livin with us, so just being able to put college money back for him.  Ah, my son is seventeen and a junior in high school and uh --
R:  Aye ai ai.
L:  Ah, my daughter's twenty two and uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my son's seventeen and, you know, fixing to go to college so it would really help that-a-way, you know?
R:  Yeah but --
L:  So ... just the family thing --
R:  The things you'd trade, like, I don't think I -- I just wouldn't trade.  I just -- as time gone by --
L:  Well, no, I wouldn't because Stephanie's my ... Stephanie's my rock, she really is and I told her that the other day.  I mean, I love my husband dearly but Stephanie's my uh ... my, uh,  person that I turn to for everything, unfortunately sometimes [LAUGH]
R:  I know --
L:  You know --
R:  The laughs, the cries.  It doesn't matter how -- how much bad goes on, I've never laughed so hard in my life, with my friend.  She's ju- --
L:  That's right [MN].
R:  It just doesn't matter how ugly it's gotten.  There she's been with -- oh, my gosh.  I said I -- I would ...
L:  I couldn't trade -- I could not take -- I mean, money would be good [LAUGH] but um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's not worth Stephanie's friendship, though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nothing's worth Stephanie's friendship and uh ... I just couldn't do it without her. [LAUGH] [COUGH]
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  [COUGH] What's the weather like, right now, down there?  Up there?
R:  Oh, we've had our first weekend of spring --
L:  Wow.
R:  Which brought out all the kids and, you know, my -- my friend's kids are close too.  That's like --
L:  How old are your children?
R:  Uh ... fifteen, eight, seven and four.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  How about yours?  You said, seventeen and twenty two?
L:  Twenty two and seventeen, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah and then m- -- my grandson's seven months old.
R:  Ooh --
L:  Well, he'll be seven months old on the twenty ninth of this month.
R:  That's like the perfect age.  They sit right on your lap --
L:  Oh my -- oh --
R:  -- and they just smile --
L:  And --
R:  They have nowhere to go [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, shoot -- he's crawling up and trying to walk and ah --
R:  Oh, you're kidding!
L:  No.  Oh, no --
R:  Oh!
L:  I'm not kidding, no --
R:  My gosh!
L:  Not any.  Yeah.  My husband and I were sitting here the other day and we had this little footstool and all of a sudden, we see these little blue eyes peeking over the footstool --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he was pulling, up, you know and --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- it was just -- it looked like, I did it!  Look at me!
R:  Ooh!  Oh my gosh!
L:  So ... [LAUGH].  Being a grandparent is something else, let me tell you what.  I understand now why they said you would rather have your grandchildren first than kids --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Because [LAUGH] grandkids are -- you're just so totally different with them.  I mean, it's just --
R:  I'm just starting to see that, you know.  I'm just -- just starting to see that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  But no, I wouldn't trade money for Steph or her kids.  Her kids ... she has four children.  She has a fourteen year old, a twelve year old, a nine year old and a seven year old.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a handful.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I can't -- I've now -- I don't know if anyone asks but I'd surely take them both!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No kidding!  Now, if they wanted to say that, I'd say, "Yeah" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I would even share it with Stephanie if I had to do that, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Wouldn't that be -- you know, that's -- that's -- that's what I've always thought.  If I, you know, won any amount of money, the first -- I mean -- and this sounds awful but I would take care of my friend before --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I would take care of my family.  Like, she just comes first.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  She's just --
L:  Because I know how she struggles, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she's just now had to get a job and stuff because they just needed her to work again and uh ... it's the first time she's worked ... oh, my gosh ... in probably like, twelve years and so --
R:  That's exactly where I'm at.
L:  You know, so ... she really could use some.  In fact, last night we were talking on the computer and she said, "You know, the lord's really good because he's watched over us because ..." she said, "If I wasn't working right now, Jody" she goes, "We just wouldn't make it".
R:  Yeah
L:  And uh, but, you know ...
R:  [NOISE] Oh ...
L:  So, I know that she needs it as much as ... probably more than I do if you, you know, want to be honest about it, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but uh ... but yeah ...
R:  Oh ... this is kind of a unique scenario.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Would you take a million -- no, not after even talking to a stranger, I would not take a million dollars.  No, it just --
L:  No.
R:  It's so funny because when you sit down and you look at all your bills and you look at all that's going on in your life and you think, how much that would make a difference, how fast that thought goes out of your head when you think of your friend.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, they're just -- there's ... I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I could l- --
L:  When the question was even asked, you know, there was no doubt in my mind, what I would have said.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  I didn't e- you know, there wasn't even a ... a hesitation of me saying, no, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  But the next time, they say, "But would you accept both?"  Hm ... okay!
L:  Yeah!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Gladly!  Please!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  I need it!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Definitely, I would.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh ...
L:  If I could have both, you know?  That's the -- you know, having your cake and eating it too, heck yeah, I would.
R:  Yeah but that's not how life is so ...
L:  No, it's not.  No, it's not, at all, unfortunately sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes but then -- I think I --
L:  Oh, I'm thankful for everything I have.
R:  I know --
L:  I live way out in the country and, you know --
R:  Oh ...
L:  I just thank the lord all the time.
R:  I --
L:  We have two acres of land and it's just ... I mean, I'm in the country.  There's nothing and it's wonderful.
R:  Oh, I spent a couple of years of my life in the country, growing up with family, other family and -- and I treasure those days and now with my kids, I'm kind of outside of the city but still city bound, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- and I ... oh, more than ever, just wish that they had what I had, you know?  Uh, woods to run through and a cr- -- and a creek you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, I have Houston just, you know, like, thirty minutes away, twenty five, thirty minutes away, so, you know I've got --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Are you familiar with Waller[?], Texas?
L:  No.
R:  'Cause that's outside of Houston but I'm not sure where.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  It's a little teeny place but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my brother lives there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  I've heard of Waller, yes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I'm not familiar where it's at.  Yeah, I'm over here, you know, by the Galveston[?] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I live about ... I live about twenty minutes away from Galveston.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  I'm right at the coast.  I mean, right at the coast.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  That's --
L:  When the hurricanes and stuff come in --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, we had to beware and everything.
R:  You'd have -- really?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Have you had to evacuate ever?
L:  Ah, no, we haven't.  The summer ... last summer, you know, there was quite a few floods and uh, the bottom part of our house got some water in.  It wasn't real -- you know, very bad or anything but uh ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah and then we le- -- we have a two story house and uh ... but it doesn't bother me.  I just keep it in the lord's hands and just go about my way.
R:  Ah.
L:  [LAUGH].  But uh ... that's all I know.
R:  And no, I wonder ... have we hit our eight or ten minute point yet?
L:  I don't know.  Uh ...
R:  I don't know how much more I can say.  I mean, that's the st- -- do you know what's amazing?  That's just a simple statement.  It's one sentence, one word.  No.
L:  No.
R:  I wouldn't trade it, just wouldn't trade it.
L:  No, I wouldn't.
