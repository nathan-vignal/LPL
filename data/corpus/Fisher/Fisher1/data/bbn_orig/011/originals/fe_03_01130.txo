L:  Hi, my name is Jen.
R:  And [NOISE] my name is Anita.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, um ...
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Let's see, I'm a stay at home mom of ten and I live in Western Montana.
L:  Oh, okay, um, I go to school, um, at Boston University.  I'm a sophomore.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  In Western Mas- yeah.
R:  Western Massachusetts?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I grew up in Peberty[?].
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh wow!
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  Small world.
R:  Yeah, and I can tell you if [NOISE] I had to change anything I would have gone to college right out of high school.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, I wish that somebody [NOISE] had pushed me to go to college [NOISE].  That's my biggest regret is that ... I didn't go to college but [NOISE] --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- it's not -- because I wouldn't have had all these really cool kids, if ... [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Life turns out, you know, the way it should --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and everything.
R:  Yes.  So, what would you have --
L:  Um.
R:  -- done differently?
L:  Um, I think I would have been a lot nicer to my sister --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when I was younger.  Um, I definitely treated her ... um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I was, you know, I would just kind of pick on her a lot and everything.  I just -- sometimes I think that it maybe affected the way that she is now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because she's -- 
R:  You're sure you weren't my sister?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sometimes [several inaudible words].  You aren't what?
R:  I had an older sister like you!
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my sister and I fought like cats and dogs and we were little, but actually we're ... [NOISE] we're really close now [NOISE] and I was just searching on line for [NOISE] an air [NOISE] -- ah, airplane ticket so I can go see everybody.  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh --
R:  So.
L:  -- is she still out in Massachusetts?
R:  No, she's in Orlando, actually, [NOISE] so --
L:  Oh, oh, wow.
R:  -- yeah, I get t- -- everybody moved out [NOISE] of Massachusetts.  They -- my parents moved to Florida and everyone, um, followed them [SIGH] down to Florida, so [NOISE] I get to go see my whole family where it's warm.  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  I know I just -- my friends this last spring break and, ah, they went to Florida so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's really nice down there, of course, 'cause it's, you know, not -- so, is it still cold in Montana?
R:  Um, it was probably like fifty five today.
L:  Oh, that's not too bad.
R:  Yeah, the grass is starting to get little things of green and a few of my flowers are starting to -- you know, the green's starting to pop up.  So, it's starting to feel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a little like spring, but tomorrow we could get a snowstorm.  I mean, that's the way it is --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- around here at this time of the year, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Anyway.  So, how long are we --
L:  Um.
R:  -- supposed to talk? [NOISE] 
L:  I think we're supposed to talk for ten minutes.
R:  For ten minutes. [NOISE] 
L:  Um.
R:  Yeah.  Okay, so [NOISE] we've about exhausted the subject of what we would have done differently.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I know, I -- there's not so much that I can say, I guess, besides -- I don't know, I mean I -- I don't know I guess it's -- it's affected her in the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- long term.  It just, I don't know, I just feel like me and my mom, I guess, are closer than her --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  and -- she is with my mum and I just feel like it kind of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- will affect the way things will be forever.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yep.  But I really -- I think the same way you do, that everything happens for a reason and [NOISE] you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people -- I am [NOISE] very close to my mother [NOISE] and my sister [NOISE] as I have four sisters.  And I have another sister who is very close to my mother [NOISE].  And my other three sisters always make fun of us [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they say ... you know.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  My mum [NOISE] doesn't hide her ... you know, her feelings -- her feelings for the three -- 
L:  Your mum doesn't what?
R:  -- [several inaudible words] they're all right.  I have eighteen month old twins and one of them just ... clocked his head --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but I also have other kids that are supposed to be helping while I'm on the phone and --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- they're all --
L:  [LAUGH] And of course they're not.
R:  -- missing in action.  [NOISE] But, I just found him a home so.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] He's okay, but --
L:  You have twins?
R:  -- I have twins.  Twin boys.
L:  Um.  Oh really?
R:  Yep.  I have a -- 
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yeah, I have eighteen month old boys and I have a nineteen year old son and -- who's going to school in Austria.
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  He goes to [inaudible] University in Ohio and he, um, got to spend a semester in [NOISE] Austria.
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  Yeah.  And he went to Rome, and he went to Poland, and --
L:  Wow, so that -- is that --
R:  -- um, Spain.
L:  -- his ...?
R:  It's through the school.  They have, like, a sister campus in Austria and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, it -- the only thing that was different is we had to pay for airfare for him to get --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to Austria, but it was the same tuition as if he had been going in Ohio, so ...
L:  Yeah, they offered it at, um, at my school except for the, ah -- the airfare is extra.
R:  Right.
L:  And I really want to do it but, I'm not sure if --
R:  Oh, he's --
L:  -- I'm going to be able to.
R:  He's just having an awesome time.  But he wants to be a Franciscan Brother and move back to, um ... oh, gosh, New Bedford, Massachusetts.
L:  Oh wow--
R:  And live in -- 
L:  -- okay.  I know where that is.
R:  -- like, really slummy parts of New Bedford.  I guess New Bedford's all pretty slummy.  I used to live in New Port, Rhode Island, and I've been to New Bedford a lot, and it's kind of a rough town.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's what he wants to do is go there and be a Franciscan Brother, so he has to sleep on the floor and give up all his worldly possessions, so --
L:  Wow, wait -- no, is that -- wait, a Franciscan brother, is that part of what faith?
R:  Catholic.  Roman Catholic -- 
L:  Oh, it is.
R:  -- yes.
L:  Oh gosh, I should know that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, I was raised Catholic and then I met my husband and we're sort of -- well, we're Southern Baptist, but there's not too many Southern Baptist people in Montana.  But, that's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- how he was raised.  We were in -- we lived in Florida the whole time he was growing up and, um, he was raised Southern Baptist.  And then all of a sudden he just started asking me about the Catholic religion and I was telling him about it and he looked into it on his own and that's what he decided he wanted to do, and --
L:  Wow, is it --
R:  -- when he was seven -- sixteen he was baptized and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yep, and he started going to Catholic college and --
L:  So, is he going to s- -- is that what -- is he studying religion --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- at school?
R:  He studies, like, um ... oh, theology and philosophy [NOISE] and really difficult classes but, he's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing [NOISE] really good.  He's been on the Dean list for the last -- 
L:  Oh, that's awesome. 
R:  -- yeah, the l- list.
L:  Is that your oldest?
R:  Yeah, that's our oldest.  [NOISE] And then our second oldest is seventeen, and he's getting ready to go to Carol College which i- -- that's in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Helena[?], Montana.  [NOISE] That's a small, um, it's a catholic college too [LAUGH].  But, he wants to be a doctor --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- and [NOISE] it's just a coincidence that, um, he wants to go to a catholic college.  It's just -- he wants to go because of the size.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's a small college.  We live across the street from this town's school which has a hundred and fifty kids from kindergarten through twelfth grade, so --
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  -- you know, they're used to a little, tiny, school and I know he'd be lost in a big college, so ... [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Anyway.
L:  Is, um -- is that a small town that you live in?
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] there's -- 
L:  Is that why?
R:  -- there's like three hundred people here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] it's tiny.  It's -- but it's neat.  We're -- my husband and I are doing the Easter egg hunt.  We're running the Easter egg hunt this year and we just -- 
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- drove into Missoula [NOISE], the big city and we put six bikes on lay away, and this is all just from donations we've got from the l- you know, the local businesses and, we got bikes and skateboards and it's going to be the best Easter egg hunt --
L:  That's really cool.
R:  -- ever!  So, yeah.  It's neat.  So, do you just have one sister, or are there more of you?
L:  Um.  Yeah, there's, um, one sister.  She's actually older than me. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  I mean -- yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, I don't know if I would say -- well actually, yeah, I would say that I picked on her --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, I mean, she picked on me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- also.  We fought like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you wouldn't believe when I was little, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we get along much better now --
R:  Oh, that's good.  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it just seems like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it created distance between us --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that will always be there.
R:  Yeah, well, gosh, my sister and I hated each other growing up.  I mean, we shared a bedroom and we'd clean the room --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and I'd throw everything on her bed and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, she was like [NOISE], she was the bad girl, and I was the good girl and, um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's another thing I regret [NOISE], I wish I'd been just a touch bit wilder in high school.  I was so scared to do anything and ...
L:  Yeah, that's how I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's how it is for me.  I'm more of the good, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- follow the rules, do your work type --
R:  Yeah, that's how I was.  I -- I never, ever, skipped a day of school, and I wish maybe I had skipped one day at least just to see what it was like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  I know.  That's another thing I regret too, actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause a lot of my -- you know, like instead of just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're just taking more opportunities, I guess --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- that --
R:  Yep.  [LIPSMACK] I know.
L:  -- I don't normally take advantage of, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  But, that's okay --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- I mean, at least you never got in trouble for it, right?
L:  Yeah, that's true.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how did you come to do these surveys?
L:  Oh, um, there is this thing called the Quickie Job Service -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- through my school where, um, you know, people post ads --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and everything and then --
R:  Well, that's neat.
L:  -- yeah, and then, you know, you can do it without, like, a huge long term commitment.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I, um, called this, you know, line or whatever, and it seemed like quick easy cash.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, 'cause I signed up for this --
L:  So ...
R:  -- like, oh like two months ago.  At least two months ago.  And I never heard anything and then today's the first day that they called me with my pin number.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, like, they called, oh, like three times this afternoon.  I was out and I called them back and, like, a half an hour later they hooked me up with you, so -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's like, I couldn't even remember when they were first talking to me who they were and ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  -- then I -- I realized what it does.  As I do a lot of surveys on line --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, if you can ever get on with Twenty Twenty Research, they do ... I just did a, um, a week long -- it was a bulletin board type survey.  I had to check in twice a day and it probably took about twenty minutes of my time a day.  And that paid seventy five dollars.  That's the best one --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I've ever done.  Yeah.
L:  Twenty Twenty Research, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the, um, the show?
R:  I think s- -- I really don't know if they're affiliated with Twent- -- if they're affiliated with the show Twenty Twenty.  But I --
L:  No.
