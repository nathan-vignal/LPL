L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  This is Emily.
R:  Hi, Emily.  This is Mary.
L:  Oh, hi.
R:  Hi.  This is my first time.
L:  This is my first time, too.
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
L:  So, this should be fun.
R:  So, I'll guess we'll -- we'll stumble through together.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Um --
L:  So, I -- I guess we're supposed to talk for ten minutes.
R:  Okay.  And this is all being recorded?
L:  Yeah, it's all being recorded.
R:  Okay.
L:  And if we could go back in time to do something differently, I don't know, there's so many things [LAUGH] --
R:  I know, there are so many things.  I think one of the most important things I would have done is to finish college a lot younger --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- at a lot younger age, yes.
L:  Um, that -- well, how old are you now, then?
R:  I'm sorry.  I'm forty five.
L:  Forty five.  Are you going back to school?
R:  Well, actually, I'm almost done.
L:  Oh, good.  Well, see, at least you're doing it.
R:  But -- yes, I am.  I just wish I would have done it when I was young because when you're young you have much more energy, you have fewer distractions, you don't have -- usually don't have children and a husband and a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of these other things and I wish I would have just gone right from high school to college --
L:  Did you --
R:  -- got my degree and --
L:  -- did you take off time?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Did you take off time?
R:  Yes.  Well, I've just been going here and there for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- twenty something years now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So, and I have several -- I have many credits, college credits, I just now have to compile enough in one discipline to graduate, so --
L:  Oh, well.
R:  -- I -- I think I'm -- I'm pretty close.
L:  Well, that's good.  So, you wish you would have --
R:  How about --
L:  -- done it earlier, though?
R:  Yes.  Yes and just --
L:  -- before not as many things were going on.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  When not as many things were going on?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How about you?
L:  Well, I finished school, so that's not -- I think if I could go back into time I would have not had children so soon.
R:  Yes.
L:  I think I would have wanted to be married longer before I started a family.
R:  And why is that?
L:  Well, I -- just because it's fun being a mom and stuff, but I wish I could have pursued my e- -- my education, I guess, more and pursued my career more and, you know, I -- I'm at a point now in my life where I can go out and work and stuff and I like it a lot more and I wish I would have -- I don't know, I wish I would have waited a couple more years before I started a family.
R:  Because going to work is a lot easier than staying home with kids, isn't it?
L:  It is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I --
L:  Isn't that terrible [LAUGH]?
R:  Well, no, I understand.  I have three children.  Two are grown and married and I'm going to be a grandmother --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and one, I have a daughter who just turned five yesterday.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I do understand and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even though I like staying home and -- and being a mom and a --
L:  Oh, so do I.  I love my daughter, but --
R:  But you do -- you do miss out on those things, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I- it --
L:  And I wish I would have waited, you know, we -- we waited about a year and a half before we had children, but I wish I would have waited longer, just to make sure we could, you know, just to -- make my situation better than it is, I guess.
R:  What type of work do you do?
L:  Um, well I just do a lot of different things.  Um, I -- right now I'm just working for my husband's company --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm doing like secretarial jobs and stuff like that.
R:  Well, that's nice, though.  I mean --
L:  It is.  But it's not what I would have picked if I ha- -- you know, it's not my major n- -- at school and stuff, so --
R:  What do you think you would have d- -- been doing -- been doing?
L:  Um.  I actually probably would have wanted to be an editor of a book, of like a -- or a newspaper --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so that would have been my first, because I love to do that sort of thing, so --
R:  Do you have a degree in journalism or communications or --
L:  Yeah.  Communications and then I -- I also have it in teaching, so I don't know.
R:  Do you really?  That's what I'm getting my degree in.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, though, the great thing about being an editor, you can do that because, you know, with the computers and everything today, you don't have to leave your house like you did before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and I think --
L:  That's true.  And the job I have now is actually pretty fun that way.  I get, you know, all the paperwork and -- and I guess, and I also do, I don't know if you do, secret shopping?
R:  Well, you know, I -- it just -- I haven't really had time up until now.  I have a -- I also have a part time job --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which most -- most of it I can do at home.  I go into the office when my daughter's at school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and kind of get -- pick up my work and kind of, um, come home and do it and that's not necessarily every day, but it's -- it's nice and I'm g- -- I'm -- I haven't done it yet.  I don't know why, I've signed up, I belong to money and shopping --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or whatever that homeworking mom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've belonged for maybe nine months now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And I've never done it.  Ha- -- do you do it quite a bit?
L:  Yeah.  That -- well, that's why I can do.  Because all my kids are still really young and none of them have g- -- even gone to school yet.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my husband wants more and I'm just like, well, no [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I just -- I would rather -- I mean, he doesn't know what it's like to stay home and stop your life to raise your children and so --
R:  And, you know what, they never will know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- my husband has --
L:  And I don't expect him to.
R:  -- he is forty seven and he has no clue.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He thinks I eat bon bons all day.
L:  My husband's twenty seven and he still doesn't know, well, he doesn't know yet though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They -- they never know.  You know.  And -- and that's, I guess, okay because they have to focus on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- different things, you know, than -- than we do, but --
L:  Yeah.  And that's fine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.  I just --
R:  But --
L:  -- he wants to have more kids and I'm -- I'm to a point where my -- all my kids are old enough now where I don't have to take care of them like, you know, they're not infants anymore --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so it's -- it's easier to take them to the babysitter for a day while I get something done.
R:  Right.
L:  Whereas if I had an infant I would have to stay home and -- that's -- that's probably why if I could go back in my life I would not have kids so soon.  So I could get all this done that I wanted to before I started my family and where I could feel like I was ready now to be -- you know to do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that with my life.
R:  Where you satis- -- you would have satisfied --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that other part of your life.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  I -- I -- like I said, I, too, had children very young and I -- all of my whole life I wanted to be a doctor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my entire life there was really nothing I ever wanted to do besides that and, you know, I -- I guess --
L:  Well, have you ever thought about nursing school?
R:  You know I went to -- I took some nursing classes and at this point in my life, physically, it was very hard lifting the patients and it was -- it was really kind of too hard for me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, I just -- I don't think that at this point in my life it's a time to begin that.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, I have some friends that are nurses and, you know, they've already passed that, they've already --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- passed when -- when they were young and they got their nursing degrees and they did that, you're younger and stronger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you get a little bit older and it's -- it's not as easy, you know, physically.  Even though we're not old and ancient, you don't have the same stamina and strength.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- and I know I lifted a patient and twisted -- he was a big guy and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, just dead weight --
L:  Mhm --
R:  you know --
L:  Well, that's what it is.
R:  -- he couldn't help himself and I twisted my back and --
L:  Oh dear.
R:  -- then, nothing serious, you know, it went away; in a few weeks I was okay, but  I thought, "Hm, I don't know if this is such a -- especially with a little one at home" --
L:  Yeah, your five year old.
R:  Yeah.  We're ah yeah, I kind of have to --
L:  [inaudible] Yeah, that's how I -- I know how you feel.
R:  But you know what I've decided to do, is to substitute teach.
L:  That could be good.
R:  Yeah, so that way I can --
L:  And your husband is still around and --
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Right.
L:  That's nice.
R:  And -- and it's nice because you can still get out and work a little bit, well I'll be working while my daughter's in school and then I won't have to worry, you know, we'll have the same holidays, we'll have all the same, um, things like that and I'll still be available to her, but at least I'll be making a little bit of money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and getting out of the house--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and talking to adults [LAUGH] once in a while [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  I unders- -- I understand that [LAUGH].
R:  You know.  So, you never know.  That might be an option for you.  There's quite a few -- I don't know what part of the country you live in, I live in the south west, I live in Nevada, so --
L:  I live in Utah.
R:  Oh.
L:  So -- not very far away.
R:  So, that might be a good -- that might be a good option also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  What part of -- what part of Nevada do you live in?
R:  Las Vegas.
L:  Las Vegas?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I live in St George, so --
R:  Oh.  That's very nice there, isn't it?
L:  An hour and a half away is all.
R:  Yeah.  I hear really nice things about St George.
L:  I like it a lot.
R:  It's nice and small and clean and pretty safe and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah.  I -- I would like to move.  I don't really like it here, but, um, my husband's work is here, so --
L:  Yeah.  My husband's work is here, so [LAUGH]--
R:  That's the way it goes, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, I guess, too, I don't know about you, you're not -- you're not too old, but, you know, I don't -- I try not to dwell on things I could have done and should have done and --
L:  Yeah, me neither.
R:  -- because --
L:  I -- I just feel bad because my daughter is going to be so much older than the rest of my children.
R:  How old's your daughter?
L:  One.
R:  Oh, one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, then you're going to wait and have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I see.  But -- it doesn't matter.
L:  Well [SIGH].
R:  I don't think.  As a matter of fact, I was just thinking about that.  A couple of kids in my daughter's class at school, they're five and six years old and their mothers are just becoming --
L: l [NOISE]
R:  -- e- -- expecting again.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's true.
R:  You know.  So, I don't think it's that uncommon.
L:  I don't think so, either.  But I wish I -- I still wish I would have waited --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a little bit longer, just -- just to -- I -- you know, I -- it was kind of -- I had a scare where I didn't think I could have kids and so my husband and I didn't want to wait because of that reason, just in case and so I don't know [inaudible] and now I find out I can and I
