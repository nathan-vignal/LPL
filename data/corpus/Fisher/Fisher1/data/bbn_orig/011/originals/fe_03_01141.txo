L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Boe.
R:  My name's Kush.
L:  What is it?
R:  Kush.
L:  Kush?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How're ya doing Kush?
R:  Pretty well.  How're you doing?
L:  Pretty good.  So, do you want to go first?
R:  Um, mm, what would I change?  Mm, I'm actually not sure.  Do you have -- do you have something in mind?
L:  Well, I think that -- if I had to -- if I could go back and change something -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think I'd change the way our judicial system works.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yep.  Oh yeah -- 
R:  What would you change it to?
L:  Well, I think that I would go back and take a look in history when we actually started, um, making sentences easier and getting away from capital punishment and -- and making it a little bit easier for criminals and for the people who've been in prison to -- to use the, ah, use the appeals and, um, you know, if I had any kind of influence that's -- that's what I would go back and change.  Because I think that we're just way too lenient on certain people that commit crimes.
R:  I -- I actually, I think I agree with you on that.  Um, we are getting too lenient about stuff like that sort of thing.  Um, and let's see.
L:  Not -- not that I would put everyone to death, I mean, you know, I'm -- I'm -- 
R:  No. I -- I understand, yeah.  It's just -- 
L:  -- but I mean, you know, I just think that our judicial system doesn't -- sometimes the punishment just doesn't fit the crime these days.
R:  Mhm.  It's just a little easy to get around it.  No.  Um, see if I could go back and change something.  Mm.  Let's see.
L:  I'm assuming that -- that's what they're talking about instead of me personally but I -- I mean -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is that what you got out of it?
R:  I'm not -- I'm not really sure.  But -- I guess, I think I've -- I think either way might be fine.  I'm not sure exactly what they're studying, like on -- in this.  Ah, but, um -- 
L:  So, what would you go back and change?
R:  -- let's see.  I think I would change [PAUSE] -- hm.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [PAUSE] Ah.  [PAUSE] I think, right now, ah, I feel like we sh- that I would like to have gone back and changed our, um, election system 'cause, ah, I don't think the electoral college is the best idea for, um, electing a president --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, I don't know, I -- just the last election it just seemed very, um, sort of, I don't know, uncontrolled and it wasn't -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it wasn't really as dignified as it should be.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  So, I --
L:  I -- I live in Florida.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I definitely agree.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  No I -- 
R:  -- and -- and I think, I don't know, it was close enough that that sort of thing doesn't impact, like -- that, you know, it's not just like electoral vote and [several inaudible words] road doesn't necessarily mean the same thing.  And --  
L:  Absolutely.  Yeah, I was having a conversation with some folks just the other day on that and, you know, it's sad when we can't even elect our own president any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And people that we do vote into office -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it seems that sometimes they get sidetracked --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to their own agendas or they compromise -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the things that we actually put them in office for.
R:  Mhm.  Which, I don't know, it seemed like a little bit --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- like today, just recently [NOISE] with what's been going on with the war.  Um -- 
L:  Do you -- do you agree with the war?
R:  -- um, I'm not sure.  I just -- I'm just -- I just don't think it's like the smartest idea just because -- I feel like if we attack Iraq we're going to make, um, we're going to make the terrorists, you know, see it -- like see it as an attack against Islam and that's not good for our safety.  So, is it -- I mean, it just doesn't seem like the sort of thing we should be doing.  Like if we're -- if we're trying to, you know, not -- if we're not trying to -- if we're trying to protect ourselves from terrorism because that's just going to make them angrier.
L:  Yeah, I mean, in -- in some ways I -- I agree with you and in some ways I feel that kinda what the president said tonight that, you know, if -- if we don't react because this guys had twelve years to -- of resolutions that he just completely, um, did not follow --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, you know, I think eventually he will be even a bigger threat than what he is if we let him go on.  So, I kinda have mixed emotions about sending people over their to war but at the same token I think that, you know, if we let people like that who -- who have the ruthless aggression against anyone, I mean even his own people -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, then I think that's, you know, that's something that, you know, I guess from a -- from a bigger picture of -- of -- you know, like the president has looked at that, you know, somewhere we gotta -- we gotta draw the line in the sand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, you know, it's the same thing, you know.  I -- I guess if I was looking at the thing I would change parties and [inaudible] would be the -- if [inaudible], um, congress and our senate and the way that tings[?] operate, you know, from a political standpoint as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and that kinda ties into the elections because, if you look at it from the way that our country is being run with versus the way that it was actually set up to be run, I think that we've compromised a lot, and, ah, kinda taken away not necessarily the liberties but the freedoms that a lot of people had.  'Cause, you know, I mean we -- it's not any -- it's not the people speaking anymore as much as it is congress and, you know, our --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- our legislators.
R:  It -- it's gotten away from what the people think to what --
L:  Yep.  And, ah -- 
R:  -- the people in congress are thinking.
L:  Yep, so -- 
R:  And with the way it is you can't really change that for -- 'cause it -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- it just stays that way.
L:  Exactly.  And I mean, I was reading an article where if we went back and revamped our -- our congress and our legislation to -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- back the way that it used to be it would set our country back, what, two hundred years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just to get [inaudible].  That's how long it would take to get through all the red tape and all the things that we screwed up as a country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's kind of, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean -- 
R:  It's discouraging to see -- see here that.
L:  -- yeah, well politic- you know politics and -- and [NOISE] the legal system is two very controversial issues, you know, I mean it's -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- almost like talking about, you know?
R:  That's true.
L:  And, ah, but I mean, you know the -- the one good thing about this country is you have a right to your opinion.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're supposed to be able to voice your opinion and sometimes it sounds like the people's opinions aren't really heard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.
R:  That's true.
L:  Ah, where are you from?
R:  Ah, I'm from Pennsylvania
L:  Are you?
R:  -- actually, yeah.
L:  What part?
R:  Um, it's a little, like maybe forty miles west of Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, I've lived in Pittsburg for five years.
R:  Oh, oh okay.  I have -- I have some friends going to Pittsburg -burg College.
L:  So, I mean, as far as the -- the legal system.  I mean, if -- if you had to -- if you had to put your life or your family -- someone in your family's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- life in the hands of our legal system, I mean, would you feel completely comfortable?
R:  See, yeah, I don't -- I don't think I would at this point.  Like it -- it just seems -- it just seems like there's just too many ways we get around words[?] actually.  Like what the issue is and what actually happened and just, you know, if --
L:  And, you know --
R:  -- well it's --
L:  -- it -- it -- it seems like it -- it all kinda works together as far as the judicial system and, ah, um, the -- the voting, like you said, because, you know, we vote these folks in to office -- 
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- that are supposed to protect the laws and -- and implement the laws --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it seems like when -- you know, when they're campaigning everything they have all these objectives, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- supposedly that they're -- they're representing the people but then they have to compromise all these things once they get into office to get anything passed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And a lot of times that comes down to whether, you know, a minority, you know, whether they be liberal or whether they be, um, you know African American --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Mexican, whatever the case may be, that they're more interested in their vote to, you know, be re-elected than they are in the real issues.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's, you know, that's the reason.  From a legal standpoint I feel that it's the same way.  You know, we -- we take a look at -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- what everybody else thinks about it versus, you know, the -- the right and wrong of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, it -- it just -- it just makes me have question -- I guess question.  Not that I'm -- I'm anti-legal or anti, you know, political.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, it just makes me really question where we're going as a country and I know, you know, I have three kids and it concerns me that the way that we're headed, you know, what's -- what's their future going to look like?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I -- I g-
