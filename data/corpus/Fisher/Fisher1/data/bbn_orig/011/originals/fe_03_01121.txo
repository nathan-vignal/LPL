R:  Hi there.
L:  Hi.  Oh.
R:  Hi, I'm Jamie.
L:  Hi, my name's Donna.  I'm in Oregon.
R:  I'm in Illinois.
L:  Oh, perfect.  I think I just got your quarter.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Anyway.
R:  You what?
L:  Oh, the Illinois quarter, we've just --
R:  Got you.
L:  Yeah.  Anyway [SIGH].
R:  Well, the -- something that you regret [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my gosh, let's see --
R:  -- because I can't think of --
L:  -- where's my list?
R:  Oh, gee, I can't think of anything.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I don't know.  I can't think of anything off the top of my head, but [SIGH] something'll come up.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty four.
L:  Oh, see, I'm forty.  I have a lot more to [LAUGH].
R:  Twenty four.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Twenty four's [several inaudible words] --
L:  A little more time.  Forty nine.
R:  There's a whole lot of things that I would like to be different, but unfortunately I wouldn't want to change any of them because then that would change everything else.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Because I was thinking, well, you know, I kind of regret having, you know, children when I did, you know, and -- you know, that whole situation --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then I think --
R:  But you want the same kids --
L:  -- but then I wouldn't have my kids and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, but no, I want my kids, so I don't really regret --
R:  You want the same kids, just on a different day.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  So, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Um ...
R:  So, I was trying to think of a -- I guess I would, hm, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  I regret not going on to college.
R:  I do, too [LAUGH].
L:  Because I'm doing that now, I'm not --
R:  I'm getting ready to.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not working and I'm going back to school [SIGH] um --
R:  What are you going to school to be, do you know yet?
L:  A radiology technician.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'll be doing x rays and that kind of thing, hopefully mainly in the ERs --
R:  I -- used to babysit for a gentleman that did that.
L:  Oh.  He liked that pretty good?
R:  Um, it paid pretty well and, ah --
L:  It pays very well [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I -- when I babysat h- -- he was a radiology technician and his wife was a nurse --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I used to -- because they were both almost always on call --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- they paid me to be at their house overnight, you know, while they were still there.
L:  Right.
R:  So all -- I would just sleep at their house.
L:  Sleep at their house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, the security of having that person to do -- that's great.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Um, [SIGH] let's see, anything else I regret?
R:  I regret, hm --
L:  You know what, I got asked to my senior prom --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was so waiting [LAUGH] for like this other guy to ask me --
R:  Uh-huh.  And you said no.
L:  -- and so I said no to this guy in my english -- I'm so -- I feel so bad that I can't even remember his name now --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, no.
L:  -- and I thought, I missed my senior prom because here I -- you know, just this guy wanted to go just as a friend, you know, hey, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm not going with anybody, you know, I thought, no, no, no --
R:  And you were holding out for the better date?
L:  -- and I was like, you know, and I thought, god, I never went to my senior prom --
R:  I didn't either.
L:  -- I really, really regret that.  I really regret that.
R:  I didn't either.  I can relate.
L:  So now I have a daughter that, um, next year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she'll be going -- she'll be a freshman --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh --
L:  -- so, I'm so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm so excited to live through here --
R:  Yeah, you're going to --
L:  You're going to [inaudible] --
R:  You're going to your prom and you're having a four hundred dollar dress.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  Yes.
L:  That's right.  It's like, learn how to sew because if you want this marvellous dress, you'll make it yourself.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.
L:  But, yeah.  So --
R:  I -- I did the same thing, but I didn't do it -- well, I missed my senior prom, but I, um, it wasn't on account of I wasn't waiting for a date huh [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  I had a boyfriend at the time and, you know, I shouldn't have been dating him because he was a loser and --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and he was in college and he didn't want to --
L:  Go to some high school prom.
R:  -- he did not want to go to my high school prom and when I said that I was -- I would go with someone else, he, um, he said, fine, but w- -- did it very -- said so begrudgingly and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, to appease [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- his, you know, to his little situation there, I didn't go.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now you don't even see him anymore and ...
R:  No, no, not all.
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- we have -- 
L:  And you think [inaudible] --
R:  It wasn't too long after that senior prom that we stopped talking, so, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  So, it was w- -- completely worthless.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I don't really think there is anything else.  Well, there's got to be something.  I --
L:  I regret the first car I bought and went into debt with it [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because I've been in debt for my cars ever since then.
R:  That's -- I -- I can relate to that one, too.  I just sold my -- I just sold the first car I had to make payments on.
L:  Right.
R:  And now I don't have a car payment and I'm just so extremely joyous but I spent five years getting it to a point where, you know, I wouldn't have a payment.  Now I don't even have a car.
L:  You [inaudible] have a car.  Isn't that amazing?
R:  Mhm.  But at least I don't have the car.  Well, I just had a son and, um, and the car I bought was a two door stick shift [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  N- -- not the child car.
R:  Right.  Right.  And my intentions were good because I was saying, you know, I'm going to buy this car and my -- I'm -- I'm going to, um, drive it until it's paid off and then I'm going to drive it some more and I maintained it very well and -- and would still be driving it now had I not had my son, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- essentially it was, ah, well, any car I think is probably [LAUGH].
L:  So, then what did you end up getting now?
R:  Right now I'm driving at ninety four Ford Explorer --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I went a year older, um, but -- and it's got a lot more miles, but it's, um --
L:  More spacious.
R:  -- it's much more family oriented and fortunately for me my boyfriend, ah, has a car lot h- -- and, ah --
L:  Oh.  Hm.
R:  -- so, I -- we -- we -- he actually got a very good deal on it and as old as it is, I feel, um, relatively safe driving it.  So, and, you know, and it was -- it was, ah, we got a-- a good deal on it so I was able t pay cash for it and not have to do a payment, so [LAUGH].
L:  Isn't that nice?
R:  Yes.  It is extremely nice.  It's nice not to have to pay -- not to have to pay for full coverage either.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, on the insurance.  So.
L:  Right.
R:  Which is good.
L:  [SIGH] I regret --
R:  Let's see.
L:  -- buying so many beanie babies [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I know a lot of people who've been --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- buying so many beanie babies.
L:  It's like [SIGH] oh, what can I do with all these things?  I think I'll have a garage sale and get rid of them.
R:  Yeah [MN] --
L:  I'm just sitting in my room and I'm just looking in my closet and then looking at this big clear bucket, it's like full of beanie babies [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, there are so many people out there though --
L:  What a waste --
R:  -- that are still -- they're still buying them, though.
L:  They are.  Some of them st- -- because every once in a while I go into like a Hallmark or something and I'll just, you know, look and see what's going on.  I thought, [inaudible] --
R:  Pick it up.
L:  -- I cannot bring myself to buy one because it's like, what am I going to do, stick up in my bucket in the bottom of my closet?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you should try to get rid of them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- instead of regretting it, you could end up making some money from them.
L:  That's right.  Right.  Try to get rid of them somehow.  Have a garage sale and see if little kids want them or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, but --
R:  I, um, I just thought of something and I thought of it this morning and I was talking to a girlfriend.  I regret not getting a belly cast when I was pregnant [LAUGH].
L:  What is that?
R:  It's -- they -- they have these things now where you order -- you can order through the mail or you can go and have it done and it's like a plaster cast and you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get a mold of you y- -- um, of yourself, you know, naked from like the waist, well from like the pelvic bone to your chest --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so that you have a, you know you have a  cast of what it was -- you know, of what you looked like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know what I mean, and w- -- you can do whatever you want with it, I don't know exactly what it was you do -- what you would do, but that was something --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I kind of wanted.  I was like, they -- I already had like black and white photos taken --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of myself and I never did it and I am kind of depressed that I didn't.
L:  So, you have the cast taken when you have the belly?
R:  Right.  Right.  You can --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- I think you can -- you can order --
L:  You can remember --
R:  -- like thirty nine ninety five through the mail.  I mean, it's relatively simple and you just have to have somebody help, you know, pa-- paint it on you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then I guess you just sit for [MN] X amount of time --
L:  And then [MN] it off.
R:  -- with it on and you peel it off and [SIGH] I think there's something in between your -- your skin and the plaster --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  Um, and, ah, yeah, and then you've got a cast of what -- of what it was like for you.
L:  And the black and white photos, I've seen that, of like --
R:  I --
L:  -- pregnant women --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or newborn babies with dads --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or whatever, those are just the coolest --
R:  I -- I went to, ah --
L:  -- I love black and white photos --
R:  Me too.  I-- because it helps hide your flaws [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] the blemishes.  I went to -- I worked with a women that w- -- was going to school for photography and she took pictures of a w- -- a girl, another girl that was working with us that was pregnant and they were beautiful and I always wanted to do them and now, you know, and now it's over.
L:  Oh, you'll have another one.
R:  Yeah, but it can't -- it's not going to be your first one.
L:  But it won't be that one, right.
R:  Won't be the first one, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  And that -- that I --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- that I truly regret [LAUGH].
L:  Back to that, with pictures of children, I regret the fact that I have -- and I think this happens in almost every family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have a bazillion pictures of my oldest son and my other two kids it's kind of like, oh, my god, I have to go find a picture --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of them somewhere.
R:  And you don't have as many.
L:  And it's like I feel so bad, it's like, okay, where's your pictures?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I'm -- I'm the youngest of three girls --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my oldest sister, oh my god, there's so many pictures of her and then as being the last one, it's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Mom, don't you have any pictures of me?"
R:  It's like they stopped using film, or --
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] It's kind of funny.
R:  I -- I feel the same way, um, on the picture thing and this is just my first son.  I'm like, you know, everybody from where I used to work and where my boyfriend works now, they all want pictures and they can't believe that I don't have any and most first moms take a bazillion pictures --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and there will be a coup- -- there will be two to three weeks will go by before I take his picture --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that's, you know what I mean --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- and I'm like, yeah --
L:  Girlfriends of mine would have, you know, in their purse, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- pictures of their kids.  I don't have pictures of my kids in my purse.
R:  I have one and it was from --when he was six weeks old and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I was just at -- I was just out [inaudible] just the other day, like last, a week ago Sunday and that was the thing they asked me and, um, the guy was like, are you serious?  Like this is the most recent picture you have of your son?  And I'm like --
L:  What kind of mother are you [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was like, oh, they're all digital, ah [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you want to come out to my car [LAUGH] I've got a camera, I'll show you the slides.
L:  When I was in sixth grade --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this is another thing I was -- just thought of, um, I needed braces --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, I d- -- not horrifically or anything, but I needed braces and I remember I was just so firm on the fact that no, I am not getting braces and I regretted not getting them then, I ended up having them now, being older and they're off now and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just h- -- what a difference it makes in my smile and my teeth and everything and I thought --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well, you know, I regret not letting my mom just say --
R:  Just do it.
L:  -- "This is what you're doing, you're getting braces" [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH] And having somebody else pay for it to boot, right [LAUGH]?
L:  Exactly
