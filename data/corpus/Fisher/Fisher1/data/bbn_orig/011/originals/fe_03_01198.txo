R:  Hello.
L:  Hello [LAUGH].
R:  Hi.  My name is Connie Tipido[?]
L:  I'm Amy.
R:  Hi, Amy.  Um ... have you ever done this before?
L:  No [LAUGH] this is my first call.
R:  Oh, wonderful, me too [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I was really hoping I was going to get somebody who'd done this before.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The topic is if somebody would give us a million dollars with the stipulation that we could never talk to our best friend again.  Um ... how do you feel about that?  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  My -- my best friend lives in -- in Germany, so I'm thinking, if I could still email her [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  ... and write letters ...
R:  And that's not talking, correct? [LAUGH]
L:  Correct [LAUGH].
R:  See, I hadn't thought about it from that angle.  That would be a possibility in today's world, that you could never --
L:  Or I could learn sign language for when we visit.
R:  Well, now that's true too.  See, I hadn't thought about that either.  I keep thinking there is absolutely no way in the whole world that I would never talk to that person again.  There is nothing worth that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  If it was just no communication, no seeing at all, I -- I would have to say no, too, I think.
R:  Yeah 'cause that's -- that's, you know, that -- that's one thing that -- it's like, you know, friends are friends [LAUGH].  They're like family.  It's like, you know, somebody sticks with you through thin and -- thick and thin, you're absolutely going to have to, you know, stand behind them and ... not even for money, even though it'd be nice.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah and then they tax away so much of it anyway [MN].
R:  That's true.  Yeah, we'd just make Uncle Same even --
L:  It wouldn't be a whole million.
R:  Yeah, we'd make Uncle Sam even richer and that would be no fun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ... like, just ... what other kind of angles would there be on this topic?
L:  Mm.
R:  Um ... 'cause it's my understanding that we have to talk for ten minutes --
L:  For ten minutes [LAUGH] yes.
R:  -- gee whiz ... mm ... uh --
L:  No, I guess I would wonder, who is this person that is gonna give a million dollars for that and is it just a joke and [LAUGH].
R:  That's true, that's true.  And uh, who'd have money to give in a situation like that, that you would, you know, forfeit your best friend?  That would be interesting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not a very kind person [LAUGH].  Makes you wonder if they have any friends.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and what do they consider [inaudible] to be, you know, that money is more important than friends.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah and I wonder if you could discuss this with your best friend first ... split the money or if you had some really good thing that it was gonna go to [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, that's true, could give it to a charity or something like that but then would it make it worth it [LAUGH]?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I'm kinda like you.  I like the idea of the sign language and the email.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] and that would make -- then you would have to consider, you would really have to maybe consider that.  Gee, I did not realise that ten minutes was going to be a very lengthy period of time [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You live where?
L:  Washington State.
R:  The state of Washington?
L:  Yes.
R:  I live in Louisiana.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Interesting.  In -- in the state of Washington and now after nine one one, I'm -- I'm sure that [MN] you all even build a -- a closer bond like everybody did here in Louisiana, you know and -- and that's what, you know, when I read the topic, it was like, ooh, after nine one one, you know, everybody got closer and things like that.  It's like, I -- I just ... I -- I couldn't see it and then with the world fixing to go to war, it's like, you know, friends are gonna need friends.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah but it's a strange question [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  I know [LAUGH].  Mm.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, do you have a lot of friends?
L:  A lot of friends?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah but I have one that's my best friend for the last -- -- last seventeen years, I think.
R:  Oh, wow, seventeen years [LAUGH].  That's interesting.  The -- the person that I would consider to be my best friend is ... actually, she's originally from California and she moved to Louisiana uh when she got married and ... two totally different people okay, but for some reason we bonded and -- and we've both been through a whole lot and probably, if I had to guess, it's probably been longer than that.  My first child is now twenty four so I've known her for twenty four years.  Hello?
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  Okay [LAUGH].  I've known her for twenty four years and it's like, there's just no way that I could, you know, give up our friendship for nothing with her, even though we're -- we're two totally different people [LAUGH] okay?  It seems like there has always been something that we have always bonded and kept us together.  She sees things in different lights than I do.
L:  Mm.  That's interesting.  My best friend, I think, we're friends because we are so much alike and we're ...
R:  Really?
L:  ... both kind of different, you know, from most people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That we found a lot in common.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, that was your common bond?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  See, my friend ... her name is Angie.  She makes me see things in a different light and I find that very, very helpful.  I'm -- I'm kind of, I guess, closed minded.  I see things my own way [LAUGH] and she helps me to see things in another way and it's like, oh, okay then.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I've always found that to be very helpful for me in -- in our -- our friendship and I really -- I can't wait to call her tomorrow and ask her this question and see what [LAUGH] she would say [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And say, okay, Angie, if somebody would offer you a million dollars but you could never talk to me again ... she would probably say the same thing you did, could we email each other?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] It's like, going around the topic, it's like, [MN].
L:  [COUGH]
R:  No form of communication but I never thought about email or sign language.  Those would be different avenues.
L:  Yeah.  Now, if my best friend lived next door, then I would just have to say no way but since she's in Germany anyway and we see each other about every two years ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  ... and we mostly do just communicate by email [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow because I was going to ask you, how do you communicate with somebody who's so far away.  I mean, that's --
L:  Mostly email 'cause the phone is not that expensive any more but, you know, when you're nine hours apart and everything ...
R:  Time.  Time's a factor.
L:  We both have young children and yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's interesting [LAUGH].  Yeah, time -- I had a son who was in military and time was -- he was in Japan and -- and that was always such a big thing, was to communicate because of the time difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I found that hard.  Well, that's interesting.  So, you both have -- you have small children?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I cannot think of another angle to speak on this topic.
L:  No.  Are they gonna break in and tell us when it's ten minutes [LAUGH]?
R:  They're supposed to.
L:  Okay [LAUGH] 'cause I didn't look at the clock.
R:  Yes, I didn't either.  They're supposed to come in and -- and say that, you know, we've con- -- we've conversed long -- well, that was my understanding, I should say.  Mm.  Yeah, who would offer somebody a million dollars?  It would have to be something like research or something like that.  I mean, first of all, who's got a million dollars to give away for no reason?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, are you a stay at home mum?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  I am too, now.  I -- I did work out for a little while, however.  I'm back at home now and basically, all of my children are ... my -- my baby is sixteen.
L:  I just have one four year old.
R:  How old?
L:  I just have one four year old.
R:  Oh, gosh [LAUGH].  I have five.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm thinking, their friends, you know, if that question were posed to them with their friends, my kids would just have a blind fit.  There would be no way, there would be no be- -- ways that money would entice them 'cause they're very, very close bonded, extremely close bonded [LAUGH] so even -- even in uh -- uh -- in younger children, I really don't think that even the money factor would come into play with mine.  You know, I -- I -- I have children, like, twenty four, twenty three, uh, twenty, seventeen and sixteen and even the sixteen and seventeen year olds ... they're, you know, they're so closely bonded with their friends.  There is no way that even money would tell them, you know, oh no, I'll -- I'll never give up, you know, my friendship.  There is no way they would do that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  I guess that's a good thing, to have friends that are ...
R:  Oh, they're -- believe me, they're thick and thin.  They're closer than bosom buddies.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I guess, even age doesn't [MN] play a factor in that either.  You know, to say that money would make a difference.  It's interesting.  I can't wait to ask all of my children [LAUGH] and see ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... if in fact it -- you know, even if that would.
