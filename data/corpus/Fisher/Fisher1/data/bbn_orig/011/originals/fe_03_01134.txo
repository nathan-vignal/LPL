R:  Hi, my name's Delores. 
L:  Hi, mine's Jackie.  I've so -- I'm so shocked with this one, I'm kind of --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- how?  Duh!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Can you think of anything you would like to say?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, let's see.  Um, I'm divorced so I say that I would probably not marry my ex-husband.  That's an easy enough topic for me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, well, I -- you know, I probably wouldn't get married again.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I am married.  But, you know, it's like I think people change as time goes on.  I always say it's every seven years people have a change of some sort.  [LAUGH]  
R:  You know what?  I believe that too -- 
L:  Do you?
R:  -- I think that, um, yeah, I've talked to a lot of senior citizens and talked about how, um, when they first married particularly, um, when they marry young, how they were totally different than the people they became --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- as they got older.  And the talk about how the things that -- and this is common with -- I guess with all people and relationships.  But, they talk most about how the things that they thought were so cute and, um, and funny when they married the person, annoy them now.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's -- that's very true.  And I think too, a- as years go on we learn more and so we change from that and we -- we tend to go in different directions.
R:  Right.  I think we change with our life experiences.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  I think the more that --
L:  Hell, every year!
R:  Right!  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm sort of sitting here l- listening to Bush and I'm going, "Things are really going to change shortly".
R:  I know, it's funny, I was looking at him too thinking, "I really shouldn't be looking at this.  I think this is really going to make me mad and I shouldn't --" 
L:  I know, I know.
R:  "-- I shouldn't watch this" but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  Is -- have you received any phone calls from Fisher before?
R:  No.  This is my first phone call.
L:  I was going to say this is the first one I've got, and I thought it was over in March and I had just totally given up.  I'd email them and I'd said, "You know, I don't understand this".  And here -- I'd given them my social security number and everything, and I'm going, "Argh".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So, where do you live?
R:  I live in Marietta, Georgia.  How about you?
L:  Oh, I'm in California.
R:  Oh, oh -- 
L:  By San Francisco.
R:  -- oh, how nice -- 
L:  Yes, so we're [inaudible] 
R:  -- so, what time is it out there?
L:  It is five fifteen.
R:  Oh, okay.  So --
L:  So, you've got what -- about seven?  [inaudible] 
R:  -- um, it's eight o'clock, actually --
L:  Eight, oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How's your weather been?
R:  Oh, it's been wonderful today.
L:  Yeah.  We've had a really nice winter for that matter.
R:  Yeah, I'm hoping -- now we've had some really warm days the last two weeks and, of course, spring is almost here, I'm hoping that it continues that way.  But, here in the south we have strange weather.  It's a --
L:  You never know.
R:  It's -- 
L:  It's kind of [inaudible].
R:  -- not unusual for us.  We've had an actual ice storm in April.  So -- 
L:  Oh, really?  Wow.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it can get really, really bizarre.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  We've had just -- it's just -- we have had very little rain.  Whenever it's rained this winter it's come in mass and just hit for a few days really hard and then it's gone away.  And, like, today it's sunny and beautiful out.  It's just very crazy.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I mean -- I've lived here -- what about -- we've been here for about twenty some odd years, but I'm originally from Seattle.  So, I'm kinda used to the rain.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And you've lived in the south all your life?
R:  Uh-huh -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- been here, um, with the exception of -- well, for about six months I was in, um, outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, it was too cold there.  And then my brother went to work in Michigan -- in Pontiac, Michigan.  So, I would spend summers with him but it was still -- it was -- wasn't the south.  I just -- I love the south, I love the -- the weather, usually.
L:  Even the humidity?
R:  Even the humidity.  It's just -- it's just always been home.
L:  See now there again there's -- if I had something to change I probably wouldn't have stayed in California.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  It would have been my choice to leave.  Yeah, because people who live here -- if you ask -- you can always ask them the same question and you'll get the same answers.  Why are you here?  And it's the weather.  They -- they never have any other reason to give you why they are still here --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- why they are still here.  I mean, life is crazy.  It is hectic, it is fast.  It -- you know, it's just -- I'd probably move back home.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  I have -- because there's so many things that we would do over again [LAUGH] in -- in a sense -- 
R:  I know, I know, um -- I think that primarily it would be for me getting married.  Now, m- m- m- I think that my husband and I had a very good relationship before we got married.  But, once we got married he turned into his father.  One of those -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, you're my wife, and you'll do what I say --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kinda thing.  Because his -- his parents had the kind of relationship where his mother just doted on his family -- on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, his -- his brothers and sisters and his dad.  One of those -- now, again -- see this is probably not easy for you to relate to but here in the south women tend to be, um -- where men are almost put on pedestals.  I know his mother worked --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- just like his dad did. 
L:  I don't think I would like that!  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm too much in charge.
R:  But, now listen.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, after she had worked eight hours just like he had and then took care of their kids, when his dad came home she would, not only cook, but she would, um, prepare his plate and, um, bring it to the table.  And if he wanted something while she was eating, she'd jump up, she'd go and get it.  You know, and that's how he saw marriage.  So --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, so once we got marri- uh, married, it was just -- no, that wasn't what I wanted.
L:  No, it isn't.  How long were you married?
R:  Ten years.
L:  Mhm.  And do you have any children?
R:  Mhm.  I have one son and ... thank goodness, um, he's not like his dad at all.  I think that -- not necessarily, um, the fact that, you know, we separated when he was so early, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he's just -- he has a whole different kind of mind set.  He doesn't believe that, um, he -- he treats, I think, women as equals --
L:  How nice.
R:  -- rather than thinking, you know, that --
L:  And how old is he?
R:  He's twenty.
L:  Twenty.  See, like, mine are older.  Mine -- I have a son that's, um, ah Chris will be thirty four this year and my youngest will be -- actually Chris'll  be thirty five.  My youngest is thirty fi- ah, thirty.  Ah, my youngest one has cerebral palsy.  He's disabled.  He -- he lives, kind of independently in an apartment away from us, and -- and my other son is a, um, graphic designer.  And he -- he's totally different than his father, just totally.  You know, he's very outgoing, very a- a- a- actually when I talk to him now I go, "Wow".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm proud, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, there were years where I didn't think that would be.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  M- mhm.  It's amazing.  So, is your son in school then?
R:  M- mhm -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  He is and, um, he's going through right now a sort of, "I don't know what I want to do with myself" sort of phase.
L:  Oh, that's hard.  That's the age that it's hard to make that decision.
R:  And, you know, I want to shake him and say, um, you know, "We've already planned what you're going to do.  Just stick with the program" -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but, I have to, like, step -- I have to step away --
L:  Maybe he's changing his mind. 
R:  -- and go, "Okay".  [LAUGH]
L:  See, he's going through his change now.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  [LAUGH] Ah, yeah, I guess all and all he turned out to be a -- a pretty good kid.  I'd look at -- you know, some of the things that he could've gotten into and he could've done.  So, I'm -- I'm fortunate.  I'm blessed, you know, that he's turned out the way he has.  I tell you though it was -- it was a -- it was a tough trip because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- when you're raising a child on your own -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- particularly a son, there just -- I talked to one of my friends at work today -- a younger girl who was telling me about her son asks her all these questions and she's just like floored that he's only nine years old and he's thinking about these things -- and I said, "You know, just wait.  It's -- it's gonna get worse".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Just -- just wait till he starts dating, you know, and he's telling you this stuff that he feels comfortable telling you --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- but you really don't want to hear".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They sure do learn too early, I think.  Actually, I think they sometimes start school too early these -- now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know, it's just I [PAUSE] -- it's interesting.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  So, if I could go back in time I would -- I would have him, but I wouldn't be married.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, th- that is something that I really do cherish for my kid, it's just that, you know, same thing.  It's -- I, ah -- I- I've always been, like, I said, I've been in charge, you know?  I paid the bills, I've done everything.  Now my husband's deciding, "Well, if I want to buy this, I'll buy this if I want to".  But he's getting closer to retirement age.  He only has a few years and so, all of a sudden he is -- thinks he's going to reward himself with everything and I'm going, "Excuse me!" you know?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it's -- so it's hard.  But there -- there again I guess he's finally growing up, I don't know, it's ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.  It's funny though we both think alike in that respect, though.  I can't think of anything -- I can't think of too many other things I would change.
R:  Mm.
L:  I think b- to having a son that's disabled, I would like to know what it would have been like without hi- without, you know, him living an odd life 'cause I -- I didn't work, I stayed home with him.  And I just -- when he finally moved out and both kids moved out I finally went to work.  But, you know, it's -- my life -- ah -- w- I sometimes think -- do you ever think what you would have done?  What -- what --
