L:  My name is Tom --
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- Kelly.
R:  Oh, hi there, Tom.  This is Rose.
L:  Hi Rose, where are you?
R:  And how -- out in Oregon.
L:  Ah, I'm in California.
R:  Well, okay, we're really not too far away.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not too far, no.
R:  Is it -- is it nice and warm down there?
L:  It's been raining the last few days.  I understand it's been raining in Oregon too.  I have a -- 
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- my mother's in Salem.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, then, she knows all about the rain.
L:  Yeah, a bit.
R:  Do you get -- come up and visit -- 
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Do you come up and visit?
L:  Occasionally I -- it- it's, ah, a challenge 'cause the best airfares are on the weekends and it -- and it -- Alaska, and they're, um, Thursdays and through Monday.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's rather a challenge to get a -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- time off work.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's not -- that's not too bad.
L:  How [inaudible]. 
R:  I [inaudible] -- and had too much fun.  Hm?
L:  Now you see we've got to talk about time travel I guess, so -- 
R:  Time travel.  Yes, okay.  Time travel.  Well, let's see.  I guess they're talking about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if we wanted to do time travel in our own lives --
L:  I think so [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- or just time trav-
L:  -- go back and what we'd do if we could change something down the past -- what we'd do I guess.
R:  Okay.  Hm, that's kind of interesting.  If I could go back in time and change something.  Well, I know what I'd probably do, which doesn't sound really great, but I'd probably go back in time and not spend any time getting back with my ex.  [LAUGH] Change that.
L:  So, you wouldn't or you would?
R:  I wouldn't.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah.
R:  I s- we spent time -- we spent time reconciling and breaking up and reconciling and breaking up and I think if I'd have gone back in time and I know now what I know then, I would have just stayed broken up.  [LAUGH] It would have been easier.
L:  In one way I guess.  H- ah, how --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- how [several inaudible words] there it is, sixth floor.  How far are you supposed --
R:  What?
L:  How far are we supposed to do in the conversation?
R:  I don't know --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  This is the first time I've done it too and I've just signed up for it, so I didn't get any briefing at all [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think that would probably be what I would do if I could go back in time.
L:  [several inaudible words]  
R:  That's what I'd change.
L:  Mm.  If I go back in time, probably go back to -- I had a [inaudible] back then, ah, mid seventies which, ah, got me in the military and put me in a different path then, um -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the one I know.  [several inaudible words] took it down this path it would have been different [several inaudible words] in the military.  I had, um, [several inaudible words] the military but I had a motorcycle accident, um, causing me to break all my toes in my foot and they amputated my big toe -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so I became -- [several inaudible words] put me on the military because of that and so it, um, caused me to, ah, to [several inaudible words] in life and I miss the military sometimes.  Mainly miss the chance I had in the military to travel.  I used to like to travel on military hops.  Get to go places for free and that was always nice.
R:  Hm.  What branch of the service were you in?
L:  I was in the navy.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, yeah, you got to do -- spend time in Hawaii.
L:  Ah, some.  Most of it is -- I -- I either went West-Pac[?], which is, ah, West Pacific Cruise to, ah -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I went to [several inaudible words] Hawaii [several inaudible words], the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  That was -- 
R:  Oh, so you got a lot of the Pacific.  That's neat.
L:  Oh, it was one cruise.  It has been -- [several inaudible words] one cruise [several inaudible words] and this is one nine month period.  If I got --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a chance to [several inaudible words] more than once and got to see more of the count- more of the -- of the world and got to retire by now.  I would have retired several years ago.  So, it would have been nice -- 
R:  Yeah, that's a nice -- that's a nice thing.  I w- I wish I could retire.  I'm working on it but it's just not quite [LAUGH] -- it's not there yet.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.  What do you do?
R:  I'm a nurse.
L:  Ah, Haram[?], Alvian[?], ah -- 
R:  Alvian.  Alpion[?], but Alvian is what they call it down there.  Yeah, I have been for a long time and I'm probably going to be working until I'm ninety, I think sometimes, just to pay off all the toys.
L:  Yeah, I hear Alvian healthcare [several inaudible words] they're always cutting back in hours and cutting back in benefits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] anyway.
R:  Unfortunately, there's not enough of us to go around, so there -- you know, I mean the -- there's still quite a bit of work out there.
L:  You work full time or ...?
R:  Um, I work for the agency so pretty much full time.  I -- what I like about it is I set my own hours.
L:  That sounds pretty good.
R:  Yeah, and so I call them up and say I can work these weeks and I can't work this week or that week because I'm going to be gone, and so that works really nice.
L:  Yeah, there's flexibility.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  I guess if you're in demand you're -- 
R:  I really like that -- 
L:  You can do what you want.
R:  You know, it -- as long as I get enough hours in to pay the bills, that's pretty much it.
L:  Y- you could do qualify for retirement that way?  The [inaudible].
R:  Um, there's not really any retirement -- would've -- but there's not too much healt- retirement plans in the healthcare system period.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, the benefits aren't really that great unless you get into a really good fulltime job.  Um, I'm going to have to work on that but right now I'm enjoying the flexibility and being able to go where I want to go and do what I want to do.
L:  Sounds like [inaudible] -- what part of Oregon do you live in?
R:  Um, just outside of Portland.
L:  If I -- I suppose you fly[?] into Portland if I visited.
R:  Um, it's left.  Out towards the coast.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's about, ah, thirty five minutes I'd say to Portland.
L:  Oh, I don't get too much of that part [several inaudible words] go over to the west over by, um, West [inaudible] area.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's -- um, oh probably about sixty miles from [inaudible].
L:  You getting a lot of rain?
R:  Yeah.  Have been the past few days.  Of course we got it really nice for a while but, um, we need it.  So, we can't complain. 
L:  Good.
R:  And, ah, there's no -- I -- I just got back from Mexico and coming up through the Ciscues[?] -- there was no snow there.  There's no snow pack at all and it was just kind of really scary.
L:  All because you -- not enough rain.  If there's no snow that means there's no, um, [inaudible] water in the [several inaudible words]?
R:  It -- yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, I mean, ah, i- it- it's -- it's scary like it's going to be a very, very dry, um, summer.  We're going to have another drought situation again.  There's just not going to be enough water unless we get some more snow up there.
L:  And fires too, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- 
R:  I mean it's so dry.
L:  I remember the first time I drove to Oregon from, ah, California.  I was [inaudible] around the [several inaudible words] it was -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- up from [several inaudible words], and there were a lot of fires there.
R:  Mhm.  Was that last summer?
L:  No, it was about twenty years ago.
R:  Over twenty years ago, ah.  Last summer they had some -- they -- they were -- they had some really bad winds that were threatening all over.  In fact, we went rafting down on the road and we weren't sure if they were going to, um, close it or not and we did have to go all the way around.  They had a couple of the roads closed and the area we were rafting in luckily wasn't affected.  So -- but, yeah, it's kind of scary.
L:  I really -- my sister lives, um, [several inaudible words] she has a friend who lives in [inaudible] and, ah -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they had really bad fires over there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] fire season.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it gets really dry over there.  More so than over here, so -- um, how long are we supposed to continue the conversation, and I know we got off the track [LAUGH] again?
L:  Yeah, we did.  I don't know.  Um, ah, [several inaudible words] this is only my first time too.  I signed up several months ago but they never -- they never called me.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, 'cause I just -- 
R:  'Cause I just signed up, oh [MN] two days ago.  I went ahead and put the, um, this is the c- c- [inaudible], the, um, email I know, I couple of days ago a- and, um, in fact they called me this morning and then they just called me -- you know, they just called now.  They -- they'd called this morning just to verify and everything.  So -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I was really surprised that they did it that fast.
L:  Yeah, I got a call pretty soon after I signed up and then nothing ever happened and they --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [inaudible] asked me if I really want to do this 'cause I never make the calls.  I said, well I never got any calls.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then it was -- I didn't know what to expect tonight.  I looked at my [inaudible] box and it said, "Pennsylvania" and I said, "Well, what the hell is that" and I -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- answered the phone and then it said, "This is the -- the [inaudible] Pennsylvania calling" -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it said, "Put in your pin".  And I said, "I don't know where the pin is".
R:  [LAUGH] I know -- 
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  -- That's my [inaudible] too.  I had to scramble.  I go, "Oh, where shall I write that down".  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I didn't -- they gave me an option to press number two to make a pause.  I didn't do that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words] I -- I -- I got a [several inaudible words] and they said, "Put your pin in".  And I said, "Oh, no, the pin".  So I scrambled to find it.  I said, "I don't know".  You know what -- how long are we supposed to talk or will they really care if it's on the topic or not?  I suspect it's just mainly for people to keep talking.
R:  [several inaudible words], yeah.  Since it's speech and everything I -- I imagine that that's what it is.  But, well, anyway --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's been nice talking to you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you.  [several inaudible words].
R:  And as far as I know that's all we have to do. 
L:  I think so yeah.  [several inaudible words] want to record speech [inaudible].  How did you find out about this?
R:  Mm?
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  Um, through the internet -- I use -- I -- looking at for working at jobs for home and doing stuff like that and I just saw it and thought, "Oh, why not".  Like I said, I -- I do some different things and I do all over the place and so, you know, the days that I'm here, it gives me something --
