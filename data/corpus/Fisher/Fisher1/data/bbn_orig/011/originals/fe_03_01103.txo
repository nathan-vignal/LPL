L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh.  Two women, huh?  [LAUGH] I'm Dorothy, or Deedee, they call me Deedee --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I'm in Texas --
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Janice and I'm in Virginia.
L:  Virginia.  I'm coming that way in June.  Okay.  We're going to start our own business.
R:  Mhm.
L:  H- -- have you ever done it before?
R:  Uh, well, I tried selling a cookbook that I wrote and had printed.
L:  Okay.  Um --
R:  I didn't make much money [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  But I had a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah?  Well, I've been looking actually since June trying to find something to do, ah, from home, run a business.  Um, I want to find something that you can do from your home if you're not physically able to go out, if you have to take the product and deliver it, then you can't -- you know, that's the kind of job I'm trying to find.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I don't know what kind of job you would be looking for if you were -- how I would go about it.  If I had all the money in the world, there's bunches out there.
R:  Um.  I never thought about this.  We, ah, my husband had signed up to sell shackling but --
L:  Oh, I've been there.
R:  -- we didn't sell it to anybody --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he didn't consult me before he signed up to do it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] A lot of people do that.  There's one spouse does it and the other -- and come home and then and -- a lot of times I've heard happens is the spouse does really well and the hu- -- the other spouse is not really interested until they start seeing the tax and they go, hmm and they get involved.  I've heard that a lot.
R:  Oh, well, we didn't sell anything.  We just bought some for ourselves --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and then kind of just gave it up.
L:  Well, I've been shackling and Tupperware and, um, [inaudible] water purification systems and, um, [inaudible] so it is another, ah, another vitamin I've done.  I've never done makeup.  People keep telling me I should do Mary Kay or Avon or something.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I don't wear it, so how can I sell it?
R:  Oh, yeah, I don't wear makeup either, [LAUGH].
L:  You know.  How can I sell it if I can't wear it?  I can't tell you how to do it if I don't even know how to do it myself.
R:  A friend of my is, uh, selling weekenders clothes.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, ah, she tried to get me involved and I really don't want to be selling things to people like that --
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, I've -- I've gone to her house a couple of times and she -- she had parties and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, the clothes are attractive --
L:  And how about things like, um, um, what it is the one with -- with the -- interior decorator stuff, ah, I thought about Pampered Chef, too, but that -- even to me it's expensive and like he said in there, it asks you wha- -- if you had, um, any -- all the money, I still, there's jobs out there I don't think I would pay that kind of money to start the business that's out there.  There's a lot that they seem to be charging a lot of money and then you're -- are you sure you're going to even, r- -- you know, reclaim back your money that you've spent?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I always thought it'd be nice either to have a bookstore or a restaurant.
L:  Right.  I don't want a restaurant because then you've got so much to [inaudible].  I thought about a bookstore because I get books and sell them back for half price of what I paid for them.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I have enough books in the house to probably start a store [LAUGH].
L:  So, we could start a --
R:  But I don't want to give them up, they're like my children --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I figure, he -- my husband reads -- I read and my husband reads [inaudible] and I'm not -- I don't usually read a book again, or I don't watch a movie again unless it's a -- I give in to him and go, "I've already seen this", but I don't -- very seldom do I read a book again, so I wouldn't be too worried about selling them, although some of them are Danielle Steele, my daughter says, "No, don't sell those".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well, I always thought that one thing's that missing in bookstores is book cases.  I have -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm out of bookcases.  I don't have places to put all these books.
L:  Right, that's a thought.
R:  And I think a combination bookstore and a furniture store that has bookcases, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all different kinds, would be a great combination.
L:  There's something -- oh, there's something else that I thought of as -- that it needed to be with it and I can't remember [MN] I mean, they sell coff- -- you can get coffee at a bookstore, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you go -- I mean to Barnes and Noble, but -- and that is an idea, a bookcase, [LAUGH], so you get your husband to build the bookcases and you sell the books.
R:  Oh, no.  He's not handy.
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  But, you know, you could, ah, find companies that build bookcases and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and char- -- you know, have your books on the bookcases in the stores and, you know, show people that they're -- they can also buy these bookcases --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- and I have allergies and I'm allergic to dust, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what I want are bookcases with doors --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because so the books aren't open and collecting dust --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just in an enclosed bookcase.
L:  Right.  Hm.  That's a thought.  But then you, you know, I don't know, you could make money on that, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think so.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've -- there was a used bookstore here a long time ago in where I live --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they also sold the bookcases that they had, but it was just the one kind --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- somebody made them for them.
L:  Right.  Um, you live out in the country, or in town?
R:  Um, well, I'm in Reston[?] Virginia, it's a --
L:  Okay.  Oh, I've heard of it.
R:  -- suburb of Washington DC.
L:  Right.  Well, I'm coming to Washington next week, um --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah, well, yeah, we're going to Canada and then we're coming down, back to Texas, by way of New York City [LAUGH] it's a little bit out of the way, but, we -- my husband's never seen all of that so he's going to see -- I'm from the New York area and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I've never seen Washington, so we're going to make a big to do about this --
R:  Oh, are you driving?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  It's just -- twenty, twenty two hours up to the Canadian border, because my children just got back and that's not counting getting over to Toronto, um, to -- why I was asking because out here in the country, I can set up in my yard, I'm -- I'm fif- -- thirty miles from anywhere, so I'm on a main highway, but there's no law that says I can't do a garage sale or sell whatever I want from my yard --
R:  Oh.  Mhm.
L:  -- like you have in town, a lot of places in town you, ah, can't sell from your property without a permit.  So, that's another thing you run into, if you're having your -- if you have your own business and you have to worry about will there be permits you have to worry about, too --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Well, I -- I don't really think I'd want to have the business in my house --
L:  [LAUGH] No.  Well, I have an old store, what used to be a store which we're using for storage right now, if I could refurbish the building I could open up the front back up and use it as a bookstore or a place to sell a product.  But I don't want to have to work, if I'm doing that, if I'm going to a shop, you know, own my own business and I have a shop, I don't want to have to go everyday.
R:  Oh.  Well, yeah, I mean, it's -- when it's your own business you set the hours.
L:  Yeah.  Well, like, some of the places around here that are little like home or cottage like businesses, they -- they're only open on say Friday and Saturday.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  So.
R:  You don't -- you set the rules.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Which part of New York are you from?
L:  I'm actually from New Jersey.
R:  Oh.
L:  B- -- but I left there in nineteen fifty six.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] A long time ago.
R:  To move to Texas?
L:  Actually, New Mexico.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then to Texas and then Indiana and then back to New Mexico and then to T- -- I've been here in this city for -- this area since nineteen seventy.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm originally from Detroit and I moved here in seventy two.
L:  Oh, we're going through Detroit.  We're going to go into Canada from the Detroit side --
R:  Oh.  The bridge or the tunnel?
L:  I don't know.  Um --
R:  Oh, you have a choice.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  I'll take the tunnel [LAUGH].
R:  I don't really like tunnels [LAUGH].
L:  I don't like bridges [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  I always worry about them breaking apart if I'm on them.
R:  Well, I figure, you know, if a bridge collapses you might be able to get out of your car, but if a tunnel collapses and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Go around [inaudible] [LAUGH].  So.  Well, this is the first time I've done this, so how long are we supposed to talk?
R:  Um, it's got to be at least eight minutes.
L:  Oh.  I wasn't -- I didn't look at the clock.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know if they cut us off or --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- just let us keep talking.
L:  So, are you doing this through, ah -- how did you find out about this?
R:  Oh, on the Internet.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  That's how -- I've been looking for, um, a business and I mean there are vitamin businesses out there -- out th- -- [inaudible] gazoo, you know --
R:  Oh.  Yeah, there's, ah, well I do some surveys on the Internet and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yes, like say from pinecone, but pinecone you can't apply to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you have to -- it has to be a -- a pop up add on, you happen to be on the right page and then you apply --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, but there's --
L:  Well, I saw [inaudible] in one -- in one type of product, ah, business I thought about doing is I sew --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and there's, ah, companies out there that make bibs and
