R:  Hello, my name is Rhonda.
L:  Hi, my name is Stevie.
R:  How are you this evening?
L:  I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  Just fine.
L:  I have never done this before, so -- 
R:  I never have either.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] So, I guess we just talk.  So -- 
R:  I guess so.
L:  What would you change? 
R:  Well, I'm just trying to think.  If I had something to change in my life, probably the most current thing that I could think about was my husband passed away about five years ago.  I'd like to change that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I agree.
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm sorry to hear that.  Um, let's see, what would I change?  I think just for curiosity's sake I would maybe go to a different college.
R:  [several inaudible words] just like --
L:  -- just because college was this huge, you know, period of change in my life and where I went made a big difference.  So, I think it would be interesting to see how it turned out, you know, had I gone somewhere else instead.
R:  Mm.  Very interesting, yes.
L:  That's probably what I would change.  I mean I -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I mean I'm happy with where I went.  I don't want to say I want to change that but, I think for curiosity I might want to do that.
R:  Are you going to college now?
L:  I actually just graduated.
R:  Oh, did you?  Oh, uh-huh -- huh.
L:  Yeah, I went to Berkley.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.  So, yeah, 'cause I mean when I was making my choices [MN], ah, there were east coast schools and west coast schools -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I stayed on the west coast to be closer to my family -- 
R:  That makes sense.
L:  -- but, I wonder what it would have been like to be on the east coast 'cause it would have been -- 
R:  Could be -- 
L:  -- all new friends and a whole new -- 
R:  For sure.
L:  -- major and, you know, a different job and stuff like that, yeah.
R:  Yeah, absolutely.
L:  It would be -- 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- very different.
R:  I'm sure -- 
L:  Where, um -- sorry, go ahead. 
R:  I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] I was going to ask where you live.
R:  Oh, I live over in Concorde[?].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh. [inaudible] -- 
L:  Oh, okay, yeah, we're -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- we're in Waunakee[?].  I was wondering how they like -- 
R:  Oh, is that right?  Oh, dear, we're right next door to each other [inaudible] -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I didn't know if it was people all over the country or how that worked.  So -- 
R:  Oh, I'm sure they must have to go by, like, time frame so -- 
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  Interesting.  [SIGH] 
R:  I have no idea where this is supposed to go do.
L:  I don't either.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, like, do they just stop or, like, do they come back on and tell us to stop, or what?
R:  I don't have a clue.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't either.  Um, let's see, what else could we talk about?  What do you do for a living?
R:  Ah, I work in a, ah, RV store.  I'm a service manager.
L:  Mm.  Does that mean you have to, like, repair stuff?
R:  Yeah, it's parts and service and sales and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all kinds -- a little bit of everything.  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Mm.  Interesting -- 
R:  And so, now that you're out of college, what do you do?
L:  [LAUGH] Looking for a job.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] There's nothing.  [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right now I'm bar tending which is oh so fun.
R:  Oh, well, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and waitressing.  But -- 
R:  Been there, done that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  It's hard to, you know, turn it down when it's easy money.  So -- 
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  Yeah.  I'm taking classes for fun in sign language because it's interesting.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
L:  Mm.  So, that's what I do.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  But, anyway.  I --  
R:  What was your name again I'm sorry?
L:  -- have no idea what we should to talk about -- Stevie.  Like Stevie Nicks.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's who I was named after.  But, I don't know how that works.  I should ask my boyfriend because he's [several inaudible words].
R:  I have no idea what this is.
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  You'd think they'd come on and give us some instructions or something wouldn't you?
L:  I would think.  Hey, do you just, like, talk and then they tell you when to stop or what?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah?  Okay.  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Yeah, he says they tell you when to stop.
R:  Oh, oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I -- 
L:  -- so, let's see.  What else would you change, 'cause they [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Well, let's see talk about that then.  Well -- 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- let's see.  Well -- 
L:  Um.
R:  -- probably another thing that I would change with my life was that when I got out of high school I decided, instead of going to college I thought, "Oh, boy, you know, I don't need to do that".  And, ah, we were going to -- a group of us were going to travel to, ah, New York -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, that kind of went by the wayside.
L:  [MN]  
R:  And, ah, I always wondered what would happen had we gone.
L:  Had you gone.
R:  Yes, had we gone there and would we have stayed or would we have come back home, or what would we have done?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, there was about four of us that were going to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That didn't work out.
L:  Isn't it sad [several inaudible words] going, "No, I really wish I would have done this" -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Or -- 
L:  You know?
R:  -- or, or what if?  You know?  What -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if I would have turned that corner instead of this corner.
L:  Yeah, and -- 
R:  You know?
L:  -- everything would be different.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN] 'Cause you can trace everything back, like, you met a certain person because you went to, you know, this event.  And you only went to that event because you met this other person and, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it all goes back and the smallest little thing could change everything.
R:  That's true -- 
L:  [inaudible] -- 
R:  -- what do they say?  Life turns on a dime.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  It's kind of creepy.
R:  It really is -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- when you think about it.  It really is -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Let's see, what else would I change?  I know.  I would have been nicer to my mother.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Actually, both my parents.  I was a brat when I was a teenager, and I think everyone is.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  But, it was awful when I saw my little sister going through it -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, 'cause you know you go through that phase where you love your parents, and then you hate your parents, and then when you're older you love them again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I was back into, like, loving my parents and I was watching my sister be, you know, the little devil and hate them.  And -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it was awful 'cause, ah, she was exactly like me in every way and what an awful person I had been for, like, years.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It was really depressing, and I feel really guilty.  But, I don't really know how to tell my parents [inaudible] [LAUGH] "Sorry for being a brat.  [LAUGH] --"
R:  Just -- 
L:  Didn't mean to".
R:  -- just tell 'em.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes it's just easier that way --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just to blurt it out and tell them.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.  What else would I change?  Mm.  I would like to have gone places -- 
R:  Traveled?
L:  -- and traveled.  Hi Kitty.  'Cause I've never been anywhere.
R:  Well, like, you're still -- it sounds like you're still young enough that you can go do that.
L:  Yeah.  Just need some money.  But, now it's so scary going anywhere because now, apparently, we're in, like, the war.
R:  This is true.
L:  Or, we're going to be [inaudible] whatever.
R:  Very soon, it sounds like.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, and so it's not exactly the best time to go travel the world.
R:  No, but, [MN] you know, even within the United States would be okay.
L:  Yeah.  Just to go somewhere.  Get out of Walnut Creek.
R:  [LAUGH] There are other places than Walnut Creek, yes, that's true.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  There is a -- 
L:  -- although this is very nice here.
R:  It is.  It's a -- 
L:  I don't regret moving here.
R:  -- very nice place.
L:  It's a lot nicer than Brockley[?].
R:  That's true.
L:  Like, the apartment that I live in now is five hundred dollars cheaper and is so much nicer it's not even funny.  Because -- 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- the places in Brockley they're just run by, like, [several inaudible words].  [MN] 
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah -- 
L:  They don't repair anything.  They don't -- I mean, they're so many safety hazards it's not even funny.  But, if we're close to campus then they can charge, you know, fifteen hundred dollars for a one bedroom apartment and people will pay it, and they'll just put, you know, three people in it just to make -- 
R:  Well, and, you know -- 
L:  -- it affordable.
R:  -- the closer you get to San Francisco, the higher everything is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The rents go up and everything else and -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- everything goes up.  But, as you get further away then the -- well, [several inaudible words] I don't even know if that's true anymore though because rents are high everywhere.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I went looking because if I got a job that I just applied for then I'm going to have to move probably like Menlo[?] Park area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's so expensive.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my God, I can't even imagine coming up with that kind of money.  [MN] I'm [several inaudible words] salary so I shouldn't have a problem, but [SIGH] it's ridiculous.
R:  [LAUGH] It's kind of scary to get out there.
L:  Yeah.  I thought I was ready for it, and now it's like, you know, talking about relocating and negotiating my benefits.  I'm like, "I'm not ready for this".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not at all.  I'll just keep, you know, waitressing and bartending for a while -- 
R:  Well, now see, this could turn your whole future around too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah it will.
R:  Take a chance.  Go do something.
L:  Yeah.  Kind of just want to stay in school forever.  I'm good at it, so ... it's easy, you know?
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] But, anyway, did you grow up in Concorde?
R:  Ah, actually no, I grew up over in the south bay -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- ah, yeah, Mountain View, [inaudible], Menlo Park -- 
L:  Memo Park.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's right, down there, yeah.
L:  Oh, funny.
R:  That's where I grew up at.
L:  I grew up in southern California.
R:  Oh, did you really.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, in Long Beach, near Los Angeles.  And I miss it very much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause it was warm.  You could go to the beach, like, on Christmas, because it's still warm enough to go to the beach.  [MN] 
R:  Well, let's see.  What else would you change other --
