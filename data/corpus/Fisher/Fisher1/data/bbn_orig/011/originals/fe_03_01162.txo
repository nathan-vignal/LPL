L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Richard.
R:  Hi, my name is Gena.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you doing tonight.
L:  Not too bad.
R:  Oh, time travel -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if we could go back.  [LAUGH] Well, are you kinda shy?
L:  Um, a little.  Not too much.
R:  Okay.  Well ...
L:  What would you go do if you had to go back?
R:  Um, if I had to go back I probably would go back to when I had my first child, who's nineteen now.  And I know so much more now that I wish I could tell him.  But, well, tell me about you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  What -- what -- what would -- where would you go back to?
L:  Um, I'd probably go back and change my, ah, probably change my decisions for college and stuff, ah, change my plans for education, um, pick a better major and probably, ah, apply myself from the start.
R:  Yeah.  Actually, if I go back that far I probably would make the decision to go to college.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which I didn't do.  But, well this is kind of hard, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  A little bit -- 
L:  Is it -- is it, ah, only required to changing something in your life or could you change anything?
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  I [several inaudible words], um -- 
R:  I guess it was just go back in time and what would you change, and I think I personally would change, um, not having kids quite so soon and going to college.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And just getting a chance to go to college and furthering my education.
L:  Yeah, I would definitely pick to, ah, have a better, ah, better educational plan.  Because right now I'm not enjoying it.
R:  You're not enjoying it you said?
L:  No, not at all.
R:  How long have you been doing it?
L:  Um, I've got, like, ah, two years left.  This is my third year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'll be graduating nearly, but ...
R:  Oh, wow, if you're not enjoying it now I -- you probably better be changing it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What are you studying?
L:  Um, history, ah, basically.  It's intellectual history is what I've decided on but I would have picked something else originally -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had I had more time or a better understanding of what I wanted to do.
R:  Oh, yes.  You know, now that you say that you're studying history, if I was to change -- go back in time -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I have just started, ah, studying my genealogy, my family history.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if I was to go back in time, I would definitely have started that earlier, so that I could talk to my family members like my great grandparents --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who died, you know, before I was able to talk to them, and -- so, do you not like history or -- 
L:  Oh, no I -- 
R:  -- you just changed your mind?
L:  Um, no, I'm happy with what I've chosen now but I would have, ah, probably picked something other than history earlier, um, or at least picked it sooner and not have, ah, sort of tried to pick and choose among classes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think if I could go back in time I probably would also, ah, choose to spend more time with, ah, my grandparents and great grandparents [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, yeah, that's right.  That's [LAUGH] -- I guess especially with what's going on right now in our world right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and they always say that history repeats itself -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I don't know, I -- I guess history does repeat itself but I think that, you know, times have changed and to go back in their day -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and to understand what they went through it -- to me it's just fascinating.
L:  Yeah, I think that you've sort of, ah, put an interesting perspective on what's going on now.
R:  Yeah, I would just love to go back and see what my family, you know, way back before me -- I'm talking like a hundred and -- actually, my family tree I've gone back about two hundred and fifty years.  And to just go back and see what they lived like back then.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, compared to our modern things we have nowadays.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, well, what would you choose?  Is it in the history -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- line or ...?
L:  Um, I would probably choose to do something more along, ah, sort of a tough core engineering background and apply myself to the classes I would need to have taken earlier on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or I might have even choose -- chosen to, ah, not go directly into the university but to start in, ah, like a community college.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, so this is hard.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Talking to a stranger.  [MN] So, if you really reg- going to go back in time, say ten years ago -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what would you have been doing?
L:  Ten years ago?  In that case I would have only been, like, ah, just a teenager so ten years ago I'd probably have, ah, tried to have been a little more outgoing and enjoyed being a kid more.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] Me too.  I was very, very shy back when I was a kid, but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've kinda overcome that now.
L:  Yeah.  I was much shyer as a child than I am now.  What would you do if you could have gone back, ah, like fifteen years?
R:  Back fifteen years?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I definitely would have made some different decisions in my life.  [LAUGH] Well, it -- it's kind of hard to say.  Going back fifteen years right now, knowing what I know now, would have totally changed everything I ever did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Back then, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing and ...
L:  What do you know now that would have, ah, changed your decision or changed your -- what you would have done?  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Are you still there?
L:  [inaudible]  
R:  You're cutting out really bad.  I'm getting a lot of static.
L:  Can you hear me now?
R:  Okay, yeah, I can hear you.
L:  Okay.
R:  Alright, w-
L:  Yeah, if you -- 
R:  -- and what was your question?
L:  Um, what do you know now that would have changed your decision fifteen years ago?
R:  Oh, how hard life really is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If I could only tell my kids what they're really in for.  You know, I don't mean so much hard times and what's going on in the world right now, but just simply when you go out and you want to get your own apartment -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you see, I have a nineteen year old son.  He just got his own apartment.  If I could go back fifteen years right now, I could probably have prepared him a little bit better for what he's really in for.
L:  Mhm.  Is he having problems with that or ...?
R:  Oh, no, just financial things.  Just -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what kids run into.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Jobs don't pay.
L:  Yeah, I can attest to that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, he kinda -- you know, he runs -- runs into the, "I'm tired of school" thing, "I want a break".
L:  Mhm.
R:  "I want out on my own".  And he's just kinda going through that right now and ... but, you know, I don't know how you can prepare them for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can talk all day long and they won't get it till they try it.
L:  That's true.
R:  Which kinda maybe like our going back in time, you know, like in -- maybe if we all went back fifteen years, they could just talk to us all day long and maybe we still wouldn't get it.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, if you could go back in time do you think -- can you -- could tell yourself back then, do you think you would have, ah, heeded your advice?
R:  Probably not.  [LAUGH]
