R:  Hi, my name's Jim.
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Jim.
L:  All right Jim, I'm Adele.
R:  Adele?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Good to meet you.  [MN] 
L:  Well, let me see.  Have you thought this out?
R:  Um, no not really.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- obviously the -- 
L:  For a million dollars, I gather -- 
R:  -- phone just rang about --
L:  -- if I never speak to --
R:  -- ten seconds ago.
L:  -- my best friend again.
R:  Yeah, a million bucks to -- 
L:  Well, at my age I've lost a lot of good friend without any money involved.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, for a million dollars I'm trying to think who's my best friend.  He's gone, he's -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he's left me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband died.  He was my best friend.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's too bad.
L:  And I have a female pretty good friend but I really -- I don't have anybody that would -- worth a million dollars to me -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how's that?  I'll take the money.
R:  So, what would you do with it do you think?
L:  Oh, invest it.  My grandson's an -- a -- a broker.
R:  Oh, there you go -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- oh, you -- yeah, you'd have a ready made advisor then for that.
L:  It helps.
R:  Yeah.  I think I'd kind of be the same way because I really -- other than my wife, which I think that wouldn't really count as a -- also as a best friend -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, I hope so -- 
R:  Um, I'd -- you know, I -- I tend not to have a whole lot of close friends.  I've got acquaintances, I've got my family.  But, outside of that I've just got a lot of good friends but, you know, are not necessarily anyone I would consider necessarily a best friend.  So -- 
L:  I did have years -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ago, but I -- ah, not now.
R:  The same way, when I was -- when I was growing up I certainly did.  I mean -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- through school and stuff like that I had a, you know, I had a definite best friend for elementary school and then I moved to a different location and -- 
L:  That made you cry.
R:  -- ah, ended up then with another best friend all the way through high school -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, really after that, once I got into college and beyond, I really -- I don't know that I really have had a best friend necessarily too many times.  So -- so, yeah, I'd probably take the money too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, in, ah, in college, ah, particularly those friends are still very good friends of mine but, they're not -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- close to me.
R:  Yeah.  Well -- 
L:  They've gone on, they've had their family and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on.
R:  Yeah, that's pretty much the way I am too.  Right after I got out of college there was a -- a couple.  I got married when I was in college and so did this other couple and -- and even after we got out of college the -- the four of us were -- ah, we went over to their house or they came over to ours every Friday night and we played cards and -- 
L:  Oh, yes, those were the good years -- 
R:  -- we went out to movies together, went on trips together and things like that, but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- once they started having kids and then we started having kids, of course, then it becomes harder to visit because it's not just the two --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of you anymore and plus then they moved to a different city as well so they -- you know, it's just -- as you said, over time you just tend to kind of drift apart.  So -- 
L:  Yes, I've, ah -- now that they're all widows like I am -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've contacted some of them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they, ah -- we are very friendly -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they remember, of course, it's -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- nostalgic.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, that's what it's all about, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to move on.  I'm probably the oldest one of the gang.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, I'm still the only one in good health.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, really?  Well, that's fortunate for you -- 
L:  So, I can't discuss illnesses with them.  I won't.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, you know, that gets so depressing when --
L:  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  -- when you do that.  So, you may as well dwell on the good stuff, not the bad.
L:  I signed for -- great satisfaction and money, so the million -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- dollars I could -- keep me busy for quite a while.
R:  Sure, sure, yeah, I -- 
L:  I did have almost a million once, but now I'm down to about a half.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mm, well, that's -- you're certainly doing better than most people then.
L:  Well -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- it's taken a life time, you know?
R:  Yeah, I know.  Well, I'm -- I'm in my mid forties and -- and still in -- 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- that kind of accumulation phase so, for me a million bucks would be very, very welcome.  I had a -- 
L:  Yeah, but, you won't need a million when you're my age -- 
R:  -- I had almost half a million at one point but, then, um, went through a divorce which, of course, took quite a bit -- 
L:  Oh, that's expensive.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of it all -- oh, yes, it was very expensive.  And then also just with -- what the market has done over the last couple of years.  Some of that has eroded as well.  So -- 
L:  That's what's got me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although I do have a broker, a -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- gr- my only grandson.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But he says that it will recover.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I think it will -- 
L:  I'd like to [several inaudible words] with a million though wouldn't you?
R:  Yeah, it sure would be nice, wouldn't it?  I -- 
L:  [LAUGH] What -- 
R:  -- I'm going to -- 
L:  -- happens to this conversation?  Do you have any idea?
R:  I have no idea.  They -- it's -- they said it's some kind of linguistics study so, I guess, I don't know if they're studying speech patterns or if they're studying -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, wh- stru- -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, structure or I -- you know, who knows --  
L:  Where are you from basically?
R:  I'm -- I'm in Ohio.
L:  Ohio?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, Oxford?
R:  Ah, close actually.  I'm -- I'm down, ah, south of Dayton, in a little -- 
L:  South of Dayton.
R:  -- yeah, down in a little -- 
L:  Oh, Oxford's there.
R:  -- south between -- 
L:  Eaton?
R:  -- Dayton and Middletown.  Which is -- 
L:  What's the name of it?
R:  -- it's, ah, Spring[?] Borough[?] is the name of the city.
L:  Spring Borough.  I don't know that one.  I have my one daughter, ah, her husband runs St Clair's Supply.  That's in Eaton, Ohio.
R:  Oh, sure.  Yeah, I've been through Eaton.  That's right -- 
L:  Well, it's probably the big- biggest --
R:  -- that's right over on the Indiana border.
L:  -- business there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- it's right over on the Indiana border.  I go -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- over there whenever -- 
L:  Well, they both -- 
R:  -- I, ah -- 
L:  -- they went to Miami, [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I had a good friend who was a professor there.  So -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, but -- 
L:  I knew a few.
R:  How about you?  Where are you from?
L:  I went to Penn State.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And both of my husbands -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where Penn State graduates.  Both -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Lima[?] fraternity brothers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, and then I went to the state New York, ah, up in [inaudible], New York, to get -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- my masters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've spent twenty years teaching.  So -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  I've been -- I started out to be a hospital dietitian and I -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- didn't like it.
R:  Oh.
L:  After all those struggles.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, brother.
L:  It's a rough course.
R:  Yeah.  My youngest -- my -- my daughter, um, is just graduating high school this year and she's going to Ohio State to major in teaching.
L:  Good.
R:  She wants to go into teaching -- 
L:  That's a -- 
R:  -- as well, so -- 
L:  -- wonderful career for a girl, 'cause you can have your family -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  My -- I have three daughters -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we all went to school together.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, they understand a working -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mother.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and, ah, you know, my daughter just the whole time, a- a- all her life basically she's wanted to be a teacher.  She's always been one of those types that helps -- 
L:  That's true.  I had a daughter -- 
R:  -- other people and -- 
L:  -- like that.  She's fourth generation teacher.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- teachers and nurses are made.
R:  Uh-huh -- 
L:  I don't know how I g- I got into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because my science background I guess.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] 
L:  I, er, I couldn't believe the science that they were teaching my kids.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  Well, certainly if I got a million bucks, ah, a lot of that would go towards helping her with -- out with her school -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, instead of her having to take out the student loans and things like that -- 
L:  It wasn't easy for you, was it?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Was it easy for you to go to college?
R:  No, not at all, in fact -- 
L:  You see that's -- 
R:  -- I was really kind of the first one from my family -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to go.
L:  Oh.
R:  My dad, ah, and mum are both working class people.  My dad worked at the local power company for his whole life, barely -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- graduated high school.  My mum got out of high school but then as -- as they did in those days, she stayed home to raise a family.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, she had me when she was eighteen.
L:  Oh, my.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And, ah, she, ah, she -- 
L:  You know, that's so much better than -- I have a grand [several inaudible words] my nephew -- my only nephew -- forty six his first baby.
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  He said, "I'll be a grandfather --" 
R:  Should be, yeah, yeah, really -- 
L:  "-- [several inaudible words] grandfather".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow, so -- but my dad actually wouldn't -- really wouldn't let my mom work.  You know, he was of the old -- 
L:  That's right.  I feel that way -- 
R:  -- school that -- 
L:  -- as a teacher -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I feel it's very important.
R:  Right.  So, that's, you know -- so, my mom never worked until my youngest -- but, I'm the oldest of three and my youngest brother was probably in, I don't know, eighth or ninth grade before -- 
L:  That's wonderful.  [inaudible] -- 
R:  -- dad would even let her consider getting a part-time job.
L:  I've -- I -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- it's only the -- it's a good way to go.
R:  Yeah.  So, but I was fortunate -- 
L:  I -- I'm [inaudible] in favor of -- of that I -- 
R:  Yeah, well -- 
L:  -- my children --  
R:  -- and I did the same thing.  My -- my ex and I, when -- when we had our first child she stayed home.  And she stayed home -- we had two and, ah, she stayed home until the youngest one was, and I think first or second grade.  You know, full time in -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- school.  She stayed -- 
L:  That's what I did.
R:  -- home with them.
L:  That's what I did -- 
R:  W- 
L:  -- I -- I still say, after teaching all those years, a home life is number one.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And the men are too busy, I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're -- they've got their mind full of stuff from working all day.  Ah, this generation is different than -- they share everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, my husband Dan, h- he came home, he wanted to either rest or play tennis or play golf.  He -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- didn't want to bother with kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, he didn't really know them as people.  Now, my nephew at forty six the most wonderful thing that ever happened in his entire life -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was his baby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] years ago he would have drowned it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It is awfully like, though, like you say, because -- I mean, he's going to be retiring when the kid graduates from high school.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And that's just -- that -- 
L:  But, it's such a joy to him.  It means he spends all -- every second -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with her -- 
R:  Well, and that's good because he --  
L:  -- he can't think of anything more -- more -- 
R:  -- has the maturity to do that.  I mean, that is one advantage of him having -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] late in life is he has the maturity to realise how important that is.
L:  Well, I have one daughter at nineteen, I think, she may be twenty.  She had her -- and I was so jealous because she played with her -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the floor and she -- I mean, it -- she enjoyed her.  She didn't worry.  This guy is so worried all the time -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- she's going to pick up some germs.  You can't wear any shoes -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the house.  It's a nightmare.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't even like to go there.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, I might touch her.  My  hands are probably -- where would -- where'd you -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- stop on the way out here?  Oh -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I w- why didn't you just tell me, "Go and wash your hands".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it -- it's bad too, you know, either way.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  But it was fun to watch her.  And I have a friend here they have w-
R:  Mm.
