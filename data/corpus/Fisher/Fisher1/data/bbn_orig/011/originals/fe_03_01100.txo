R:  Hello.  
L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, this is Mario.
L:  Hi, this is Rett.
R:  Hey, Rip.  So, tell me how would you go about doing that?
L:  [LAUGH] Um, well, ah, presumably there'll be a number of things that have to be put in place, um, you know, getting the --
R:  Well, what kind of business would you do, first of all?
L:  [COUGH] Um, I would much rather be um a business of service and providing ah goods and services that people in the community needed.
R:  Like what?
L:  Um --
R:  Now, remember, money's no object, so, I mean, what service would you provide that a community needs?  Okay.  We got a grocery store down the street, we got a barber shop, we got a strip mall.  What service would you provide?
L:  Interestingly enough, um, most of the communities what I'm talking about --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we have, um, probably a liquor store on every corner --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but we don't have any libraries, we don't have any bookstores --
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  But a library, opening a library, a library's a, you know, that's something that the city should provide --
L:  Should.
R:  -- but that's, how is that making money for you?  A business is something that produces an income, isn't it?
L:  Well, yeah, that's why I'm saying a bookstore, um, but actually the -- the commodities that I'm talking about that I think would be, um, helpful -- let me give you an example.  Money no object, what I would really do is put like a -- a solar energy panel on every home --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, and when it's hooked up and working, you know how when the, um, meter maid, meter person comes and reads ah the meter and it's going around so many kilowatts per hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to whatever energy corporation --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- when you have the solar panel, it's going in the opposite direction.
R:  Okay.
L:  In fact, what you're doing is you're selling back energy to ah the grid and the energy company actually pays you a check at the end of the month.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, one this will help decrease the, ah, pollution and, um, the constant, um, diminution of the, um, resources that are non renewable energy resources, like oil and coal and that sort of thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, so it's -- it's energy friendly, earth friendly and it's helping the people.
R:  Sure, you're right.
L:  [LAUGH] Um.  Another thing that -- that I found that would be useful would be ah water.  Um, water purification, um, the -- because [inaudible] has kept us one of the m- -- the largest problem that has not been tackled in the world, um, most of the, um, [SIGH] malnutrition --
R:  Yeah, but they -- 
L:  -- problems --
R:  -- now, hold on, hold on, now, you're leaving the issue.  The issue is, if you could, oh, hypothetically, if you had enough -- money was no object --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what kind of business would you open?
L:  Yeah.  And that's what I'm saying, water purification --
R:  Okay.  So you would do a research on the city's water, find out what the purity rate is, so you would hi- -- hire researchers and you'd find a location where you could open off probably a better +filtration service, or would you sell home water filters?
L:  Um, right, the -- if I was going to do this right now, it would be, ah, for each home, um, and, ah, in actuality, I've looked in -- in another country I've actually been hired to deal with, ah, water on a municipal level, um, dealing with, um, water purification.  So, yeah, um, in this country it's probably easier if I'm going to do a business, do it home by home or business, whatever, that kind of thing.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  Yeah.  What about you, man?
R:  I'd open an arcade.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A giant arcade.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because, I mean, okay, there's not much to do for young people in this neighborhood --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I live in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, there's a basketball court and stuff like that, but most of the people that hang -- most of the older kids hang out on the basketball court --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I would open an arcade that has like a racetrack in it and games and stuff like that and I'd -- first I'd find a decent location, I'd send out flyers to find out if, you know, that would be an interesting concept --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- you know.  And I'd set it for during the weeks no children under the age of seventeen could come in during school hours --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, it would be something not where they can go hang out --
L:  Anti truism.
R:  -- I'd get security there because I don't want drug dealers hanging around my area --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- because we have a lot of that in this area --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, and I'd set up all the latest games and I'd set in -- in a situation where there'd be competitions and stuff like that, you know, where people can challenge themselves and not just the, you know, the regular arcade games with the killing this and killing that, you know, they have a whole slew of [LIPSMACK] the virtual reality games that, ah, on a learning basis --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, I'd do something like that.
L:  Cool.
R:  You know, and have -- and it would have, like, something where they could, you know, win stuff or even a situation where you get so many points, you turn them in and we give you savings bonds.
L:  Whoa.
R:  You know.  Since money's no object.
L:  I hear you.  I hear you.
R:  You know.  Or, if that didn't work out, then I'd sell information.
L:  Sell information?
R:  Yeah.  Sell information.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, how to things.
L:  Okay.
R:  How to books, how to manuals --
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  -- you know, not only would I sell them through the, um, mail I'd sell them on the, um, I'd open a little store, hard to find items --
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Uh-huh.  Good idea.  Good idea.
R:  You know.  It's -- when money's no object, there's so many things you can do.
L:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  So, um, the whole thing about, you know, you got to get incorporated, you got to get, you know --
R:  Well, really, that's not really that hard.  That only costs like a hundred dollars to get incorporated --
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.
R:  I've -- I've checked.  Actually, I have my own business --
L:  Oh, see.
R:  -- you know, but money is an object, so it's not like I can just go run out and rent a building or whatever, you know --
L:  Oh, man.  You didn't tell me you had this arcade.
R:  No, I don't have the arcade [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not yet, I'm working on it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm working on it. 
L:  Right.  Right, right.
R:  You know, I have a vending business.  I sell things that people need, colognes, perfumes --
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  -- you know, depending on what the weather is --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I sell umbrellas, fans --
L:  So, at like a, um --
R:  -- um, baseball cards, I sell whatever somebody wants.
L:  People buy.  I hear you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hear you.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  So, it's not that hard get -- to -- to incorporate and actually --
R:  No.
L:  -- open a business?
R:  It's only -- it's only about a hundred dollars.  I mean, the main thing with me is because I work the -- on -- I work out of my house, but I also work on the street, is making sure I have all my permits and stuff, peddlers' licenses and stuff like that --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.  And then, I -- when I do go out in the street and sell, if I sell in front of a business or whatever I have to sell something other than what they carry.
L:  I can understand that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, they don't want somebody on the street competing with what they got in the store.
R:  No, they don't.
L:  You know.
R:  But, you know, it's funny, legally they can, if they see me making good money, they can put the items that I'm selling in their store which causes me to have to change my items constantly.
L:  Get out of here!
R:  No, serious.
L:  So, this is -- is only protecting one way?
R:  It's a one way thing.  Because they have an established business on that set corner or whatever.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they see if something that you're doing is actually working and becoming profitable --
R:  Right.  Then they can start -- they can put that in their store --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and run me off.
L:  That's cold.
R:  Yeah.  That's the world of business.
L:  Interesting.  Interesting.  [COUGH] Yeah, my -- my brother had a, um, a cart, sort of like a ro- -- a rolling restaurant where he would have these deep fryers and so forth and, um, you know, hook up the wagon where -- where they, ah, have events and he would fry fish or chicken or whatever and do like, you know, a restaurant booth and, um, so, yeah, it's ah getting the licenses and all of that kind of stuff and --
R:  Yeah, the permit.  You have to get the permit and you have to get the milk license, then you have to get, ah, health inspectors to come out and check your facility, then you've got to make sure all your f- -- refrigeration, you have to constantly check and make sure everything is forty degrees and below for cold and hundred and forty and above, you know for hot
