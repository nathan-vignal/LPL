R:  Yeah.
L:  Mine too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay and the subject is ... you heard the subject?
R:  Yeah.  I guess, if somebody gives you a million dollars for ...
L:  To not speak to your good -- best friend again.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well ...
R:  So, would [LAUGH] -- would you give it to your best friend?
L:  Would I give it to my best friend?
R:  Uh ...
L:  The money?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I thought they said, "Would you not speak to your b- best friend".  I have a lot of hearing problems.
R:  Oh, oh, I -- I -- oh, I didn't hear the question so good.  I was -- I was watching --
L:  If I received a million dollars ...
R:  Yeah?
L:  ... would I give it to my best friend?  That's the question, isn't it?
R:  That's the question?
L:  I'm asking you.
R:  Oh.  [MN] um ... I --
L:  I thought I understood it to say --
R:  Oh, maybe --
L:  -- "If you -- if -- would you be willing to take a million dollars if you were told that you could never talk to your best friend again".  Is that right?
R:  I don't know.  I -- I -- I didn't understand the question.  I -- I ... well, is that what they say?  I didn't um --
L:  How did you understand?
R:  I thought they um ... um ... they said if they give you a million dollars, would you give it to your best friend?  I -- I ... no?
L:  Well, I -- I think we sort of got --
R:  Okay.
L:  I thought they said, "Would you take -- take the million dollars if you were told you  couldn't speak to your best friend [MN] any more".
R:  [inaudible] So, what would you do?
L:  Well, I wouldn't take the million dollars.  I have um two very good friends.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they have [SIGH] been with me through thick and thin and, you know, you can always get money.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it's hard to find a best friend.
R:  You're absolutely right.
L:  And I consider these [MN] -- this young woman, there's two of 'em as a matter of fact, to be my best friends.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I've heard people say, "I don't have a best friend", so when you don't have a best friend, you -- you have to search yourself and see what's going on because I believe everyone has a good friend.
R:  That's true.
L:  Best friend.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I have friends.  I have thousands of friends.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I only have two best friends.

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When I -- I -- I [inaudible] you know, I needed them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I didn't ask them.  They just stepped in and took charge.
R:  That's good.  You're lucky.
L:  And ...
R:  You're lucky.
L:  Beg pardon?
R:  I say, you're very lucky.
L:  I'm blessed.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  I'm blessed.
