R:  [NOISE] My name -- 
L:  Hi, this is -- this is Jenny Holcroft.
R:  This is Roe.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, thank you.
L:  Cool.  Were -- 
R:  Is this a first?  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is the first time you've done this?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's okay.  Me too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, we're you calling from?
R:  San Diego, California.
L:  Oh.  Okay.  So, we're talking about time travel.
R:  Mhm.  What's -- 
L:  So, what do you think about that?  Is there -- is there a -- a place and time that you would like to go back to?
R:  Mm.  Let's see.  Probably like, ah, you mean like before I was born or, like, if I was -- something that I've done and I wanted to go back and redo?  That would probably be something about three years ago.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what was that?
R:  Wow.  I don't know if it would be really bad.  But, [SIGH] I was in boot camp and I was in the airforce that -- I mean, in boot camp in an airforce and I was halfway through it and then I found out that I was pregnant and I had to g- ah, get out so, I don't know, I -- I would like to, ah, have finished that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you would've, like, you would've liked to have stayed in the airforce?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Is that something that you can still do?
R:  Mm.  It's kind of hard now and now I have my son and it's [LAUGH] enrolling in the war that's going on now, so I'm like, ah, it's kind of a distant memory.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what about, um, what about if you could go back in time, even to a time that you weren't born.  Is there somewhere that you would like to have gone?
R:  Ah.  Mm.  I can't think of anything really, I mean [LAUGH], my time that I've lived has been -- I can't think of -- maybe, ah, ah, I don't know.  I think I like the world that I'm in today compared to what it was in the past.  Mm.
L:  Is there a time that -- also like a time period that really interests you?  Like the twenty- like, um, even --
R:  The twentieth.
L:  -- like the one -- 
R:  Yeah, the roaring twenties and all that type of stuff.  It's interesting but I don't think I would have enjoyed living it because of, ah, what people went through and, like, the depression and, I don't know, there's a lot of things that went on with -- on back then so I like the world that [LAUGH] I'm in today.  [LAUGH]  I'm more in to, like --  
L:  If you like today's world.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I like the technology and -- but if I didn't know about the technology and -- and with how everything we have today is, I probably wouldn't like to go back to, um -- let's see.
L:  Do you think technology is the -- is the -- one of the biggest advances or is there something that you'd have a hard time living with?  Like, the technology that we have today, do you think you'd have a hard time -- 
R:  Leaving -- 
L:  -- living without it?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  What specifically?
R:  Like, okay, um, not being able to be on my computer or my cell phone or even being able to, you know, to relax and watch TV or something like that.  [NOISE] 
L:  So, what type of things do you think they did to relax 'cause we use the computer and we use television.  What do you think they did?
R:  Probably like read, ah, newspapers or listen to the radio -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, but, um.  There wasn't much for people to do back then.  That's why --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- there's a bunch of kids.  [LAUGH] The baby boom.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There wasn't much for people to do to keep themselves entertained.
L:  So, you thinking that would be -- well, how do you think that would be if they didn't even know that this technology existed?  Do you think that that would be just one of the things that, you know, you just kind of lived your life and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Mm.  Just live your life how -- I'm sure there's going to be things twenty years from now that we don't have today that they probably wouldn't be able to live without so it's, you know, your era, your time.  So, but, I don't know.  I -- me knowing that -- about what we have today I probably wouldn't want to [LAUGH] go back and live without things that I'm used to.  My normal every day life type things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Ah.  [LAUGH] So -- 
L:  I think -- I don't know, I think I would really like to go back.  I have a real fascination with, um, the Roman empire.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  And I think it would be really neat to, ah, to have lived back with -- you know, in the forum and the whole colosseum and the --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, just how different life was back then.
R:  Yeah.  I -- yeah, I- I'd worry about, though, the Roman times but they had hard times and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the wars, the Spartan wars and all that type of stuff.  So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, ah, it's interesting, you know?  You -- I'm sure everyone would like to go somewhere in time that, ah, but, I don't know, I'm more of a ordinary person.  I don't think I would [LAUGH] want to change my life right now.
L:  You like it just how it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You like your computer and you like -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- your television -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so what other -- what other, um, differences do you think that they had to deal with besides technology?  What about like clothing?
R:  Oh, wow.  Ah, the clothing -- [NOISE] I mean, I'd, ah -- oh my son.  [LAUGH] But, um, a- it's interesting I think, though.  You know, I like the -- the vintage clothes -- clothing of the thirties and stuff but, I don't know.  I [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, I'm not really a fashion person but it's -- it's -- everyones tending to enjoy it now and, you know, everyone's trying to go back to, you know, the old days and the old styles.  But, I don't know. 
L:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
R:  The clothing of the Roman times [LAUGH] was barely any- anything at all, well for the men --
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  It seems like all I can think -- oh, like, with movies that are out -- seems like they all liked togas and --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and that's pretty much it.  That's what -- what comes to my mind.
R:  Yeah, like the gladiator.  It's interesting, you know, the jousting and all that type of stuff but [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Wow.
R:  I -- I -- i- it -- it seems kinda of barbaric to us now because [LAUGH] going and killing people for excitement.  I don't know, I don't think I would have enjoyed watching that.  [LAUGH]  
L:  I know.  I don't think I would have either.  To even think about, like, their punishment.  I mean -- 
R:  Ye- oh, yeah.
L:  -- they had -- everything was, you know, public and -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, stoning and all that type of [MN].  I don't think I could live through that. 
L:  No, I don't think I could've.  I don't think I would have enjoyed watching that either.
R:  [LAUGH] But it seems like, you know, in the movies and stuff that they loved doing [LAUGH] they chanted --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, ah, I'm more of a -- a lover not a fighter.  I don't like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all the blood and gore and type of -- nah, that's not me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yay.
L:  I know.  Me either.
R:  So, this is your first time doing it?
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- well I'd had my name in it for a long time but, um, I kn- this is the first time I had a call so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, are you in school?
R:  Um, currently not right now but I'm starting back in the fall, yeah.  So -- I have family, like, goes to the University of Pennsylvania.  So, I was [LAUGH] -- 
L:  And are you from the United States?
R:  Yeah, actually, I've lived everywhere.
L:  Oh.
R:  I've lived in Japan.  I've lived everywhere.  But, that's because of military or -- it's, like, everyone in my family's been in the military at some point in time so -- 
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah, I've -- I've been a military [NOISE] brat that's why it was like some part of -- [NOISE] somewhat a -- a destined -- well, I don't know, my dad -- it was really his dream for me to go in.  He's still in.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, but thank goodness he's not going over there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But your son might?
R:  No.  My --
L:  Is that what you say?
R:  -- instruc- no I said, "Thank goodness he didn't go over there".   And no my son won't.  He's [LAUGH] he's only [LAUGH] he's --
L:  He's like three right?
R:  -- barely -- no.  Actually, excuse me, he'll be a year in, like, [NOISE] a month.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's so exciting.  So, is this your first?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- 
R:  Yeah, it's a big change.
L:  -- we're supposed to talk about time travel and -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- what was --  
R:  I don't know what -- 
L:  -- what was the other topic?  [LAUGH] 
R:  It -- [MN] it --
L:  So, how'd you find out about this survey?
R:  Um, I was doing some, ah, actually they just called for the survey but they gave me a programme and I was just doing a little searching, you know, on the internet and I happened --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to stumble across it -- across it.  You know, like they have a bunch of different surveys you could do.  They email you and you get paid [NOISE] and I've done a couple of those.  But it's -- it's pretty easy money to make in your spare time.  Like, five dollars here and there for doing [MN] surveys.  So, I was like, okay, this is easy if I'm sitting around doing nothing around when I get off for work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Hey.
L:  Well, we certainly couldn't do this back in the twenties or the -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- or the -- or the Roman empire.
R:  No.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely not.  I don't even think that the -- the -- the idea of the [inaudible] even existed or his computer.
L:  No.
R:  Hey.  Man.
L:  Tell me about your son?
R:  Yeah, he's like getting into everything.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, man.  Hey -- 
L:  Well, I'll let you get -- attend to his needs then.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  What are we supposed to do now?  About a- [NOISE] do we even have to wait for them to [NOISE] tell [NOISE] us its over or what?
L:  Well, I think that they were just going to record our conversation and -- 
R:  Then do we hang up?
L:  -- a- you know, our time travel conversation and, yeah, I don't -- 
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- this is my first time doing it too so I'm not positive.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah.  All right, well I guess we'll see what happens after we hang up.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Well -- 
L:  Well nice talking to you --
R:  -- nice talking with you.
L:  -- well, it was nice chatting with you.  Well, good luck.
R:  Yeah, thank you.  All right.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, well you take care.
