L:  Hi, I'm Esther.
R:  Hi, Megan.
L:  Hi.  So, um, the -- we're talking about going back in time and what we would change.
R:  Yup.
L:  Do you want to go first?
R:  Um, [NOISE], um, gosh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If I had any idea what I wanted to say about it, I'd be more -- more, ah, excited about idea.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I understand.  Um ... I think there's a lot of things that I would like to go back and change, but then I don't know, um, I think that they kind of make you who you are, so ...
R:  See, anytime that I've thought about that, I, ah, I've always gone back to the well [NOISE] okay, just to use a really cheesy example, "Back to the Future" movies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You go back and you change something and it changes everything else.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, then you go with the, "Okay, so if I went back and changed something that I did ten years ago" ... it doesn't necessarily mean things would be any better than they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than they are now.
L:  Right.  They could be worse! [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right.  That's --
R:  You know, you could have --
L:  -- what I kind of think, so -- go ahead, I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, I [MN] was going to say that -- that, you know, you can think that, you know, oh, this would be so much better if I had done this and you don't necessarily know that.
L:  Right.  That's -- I agree with that. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, like, okay, I'm divorced.  So, [NOISE] you know, very tempting sometimes to say, you know, it would have been better if I'd never gotten married.
L:  Right.  Do you have kids, though?
R:  I do.  Um, although --
L:  So, so then you wouldn't have kids [LAUGH].
R:  Um.  Well, I should -- that's another thing.  I actually had her before -- before I got married.  But, so it's like, okay, well, sh- -- y- -- you know, there was some debate as to whether or not I should actually attempt the single parent thing, you know, [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some of my family thought I should, ah, you know, like go for adoption or something, but my life would be totally different than what it is now.
L:  Right.  I -- I'm actually in a exact same situation.  It's funny that they said ten years ago, because ten years ago I got married and, um, I, you know, I got divorced and stuff and I -- I wonder about that, but I can't imagine what I would be doing or what my life --
R:  Do you also have kids?
L:  What's that?
R:  Do you also have children or --
L:  Yes, yes.  I have one, um, one from that marriage and then I am remarried.  So, I have another.
R:  Yeah, see, I -- it -- it's so hard to -- to say.  Well, you know, things would be better -- I mean, like, well and -- and -- there are little specific things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I was pregnant, you know, I got lots of, "Oh, you shouldn't have gotten pregnant" kind of things --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Of course, because well, you know, it happens, but at my pre natal appointment, my fir- -- very first one, they discovered an ovarian cyst --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that was not causing any pain.  So, I never would have like gone in for it or anything --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and when they found it, it was already so, I mean, it -- I was measuring at thirty two weeks pregnant when I was ten weeks pregnant.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, and so --
L:  You might --
R:  -- they were saying, you know, if I -- if I hadn't gotten pregnant I may very well have died from it.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, you can go back and say that something was a mistake, something would be different, but [LAUGH] you -- you don't know why it happened.
L:  Right.  Well, I think that everything happens for a reason and, um, even like if you can't see it, you know, that, um, something eventually comes good out of it, I think.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But, yeah, I could say, gee, I wish I would have not married and, ah, done what I was doing and life would be great, except that it might not be [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Ah --
L:  I might have, um, finished college and, ah [LAUGH] had -- had a job.  I stay at home now, so, um, occasionally I get those, you know, I don't do anything, I'm not worth anything, days, you know.
R:  Right.  Yeah, see and the -- the -- for the first part I, um, I mean I was a junior college when I had my daughter, so I still haven't been to school.  Okay, so it's like in the past eight years, as, you know, my daughter turns eight like next week, so it's like, [inaudible] about that reflection time, you know, to -- to look back and say, okay, you know, [SIGH] it's taken me eight years to get another semester's worth of college done.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It would have taken me another year to graduate if I hadn't chosen what --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what I did choose.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, how do you, ah, if you had some sort of like little time machine sort of deal that you could go in and, you know, input okay, let's see what would happen, you know, if -- if I changed this here, show me the future --
L:  Right [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, or -- or show the present based on that.  You know, if you could do that, then going back and changing things could be cool.
L:  Right.
R:  Because then you could, you know, go back and play with, well what if I'd done this?  Ooh, no, don't like that result. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, well what if I'd done this.  Oh, that looks good.
L:  I know [LAUGH] I know.  I a- -- I agree with that because I, um, I feel the same way, you know, that, um, maybe I would have my degree and I would be making a lot of money and I would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somewhere but, you know, would I be totally lonely and, you know, or --
R:  Right.  Um, you know, or, you know, maybe you'd have -- I don't know what you were going to school in --
L:  I was going to school to be a pilot.
R:  But, ah, okay, well, there you go.  Considering recent events or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not too recent events anymore --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- maybe you'd be dead! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  So, you know, it could be a good thing [LAUGH].  Yeah.  Well, and I was, um, I was actually sixteen when I got married because I had graduated out of high school early and so that was obviously a really bad choice that I can see in hindsight, but, um, at the same time it made me grow up really fast [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Well, and I mean, that's the same kind of thing, um, I mean, I say, yeah, deciding at the age of twenty to have Belle and to keep her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, yeah, it's got some -- some definite downsides to it, I'm, you know, had some major financial issues and everything and I know that a lot of the reason I made the choice that I did is because she was born at the end of March and my mom died March first.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I just wasn't -- I -- I was too emotionally f- -- falling apart already to voluntarily make it even worse --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but on the other hand, um, I also know that it was my third year in college, but I was still, oh, I don't know, half way through my sophomore year, credit wise.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know, I just -- I didn't have -- I had no self discipline and no real clear goal or vision of what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go with it, so I was just kind of doing the, well, I graduated from high school [COUGH] upper middle class high school graduate goes onto college, right, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'll go to college.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, gosh, you know, a- -- and so, going ahead and choosing to okay, I'm going to have my daughter now.  Well, you know, all of a sudden I have to put food on my table.
L:  Right.
R:  There's motivation right there to --
L:  To grow up?
R:  -- do whatever it is -- [MN] that -- that, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, 
L:  I -- I hear you.  I went through the same thing and you know, sometimes yeah I'd love to go back and change those, but you know I -- I think that I'm a better person, I think I would have been, ah, maybe more of a spoiled brat type person if I hadn't [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, sometimes people think, oh, you little princess, you know, you stay home and you drive a nice car and you have a nice house and it's like, oh, you have no idea [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And sometimes, you know, you wonder like what if you would have been with someone else, like that you were dating or something.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  That -- that one I have to admit has been a -- a frequent what if --
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  -- or even like in my case, okay, what if I had gotten pregnant by my husband and
