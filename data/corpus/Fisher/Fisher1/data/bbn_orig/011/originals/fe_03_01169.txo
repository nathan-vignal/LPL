L:  Hello, I'm Karen.
R:  Hi, I'm Bill.
L:  Hi Bill.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing good.  How are you doing?
R:  I'm doing okay.  Busy long, long day but, other than that, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, I know how that goes.  I've never done one of these yet, so -- 
R:  Me neither [LAUGH].
L:  -- have you?
R:  Me neither.
L:  Oh, so quite the experience for both of us.
R:  Yeah, I was surprised to get a call.  It's been about a week and a half since I signed up.  So -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- I know how that goes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that -- they -- actually they called me earlier today and I've even lost my pin.  I have four kids at the house and they -- 
R:  Oh gosh, yeah.
L:  -- seem to have rummaged my desk, so -- 
R:  I was rummaging through trying to find my pin too.  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Okay, well, I guess we're supposed to talk about time travel and what we would do.
R:  Well, yeah, um, wow.  I'm trying to think.  Um -- 
L:  I know what I would do.
R:  You know what you would do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  W- what would you do?
L:  Well, the major turning point -- one of the worst times of my life was when we went on a car trip -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when I had a nineteen day old baby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we got into a car accident and the baby died.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, I think if there was anything that I could do, I would go back and not go on that trip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I think it would have changed my life drastically.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow, how long ago was that?  You don't mind if I ask how long ago that was?
L:  No, no, that's okay.  Oh, it was a long time ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Many, many moons ago.  It was in, um, seventy nine.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, my son would have been twenty four this coming -- 
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  -- um, this coming Christmas, my son would have been twenty four.  So, and he was only nineteen days old.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So -- 
R:  Wow, did you, ah -- was anybody else injured or -- 
L:  Yeah.  My ex-husband fell asleep -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and drove over a cliff.
R:  [NOISE] What?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, he was going -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about sixty five miles per hour and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we drove over a cliff --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and we went about seventy feet in the air -- we were up about -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- seventy feet.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, my goodness.
L:  We cleared the electrical lines with the car.
R:  [MN] Whoa.
L:  And came down on the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- right front side of the car -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hadn't -- landed on a railroad track which catapulted the car into end over end flips -- 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my gosh.
L:  And they estimate that the car -- 
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  -- flipped probably -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- five or six times -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- end over --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- end.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  They -- 
R:  [NOISE] Whoa.
L:  -- found me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- penned over the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- steering wheel -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I was the -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- passenger.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.
L:  And they thought -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that I had been driving.  But he got [inaudible] -- he got -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, thrown from the car when it flipped the first time and I stayed in the car -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- while it flipped.  So, I was in ICU for, like, twenty eight days.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  So, yeah, you can -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- see why I would change that day.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Ah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  There's no question about that.  Oh, my --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- gosh.
L:  It was like when --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they said, [several inaudible words] go back --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in time -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that would have to be 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the one thing I would change the most.  Not having snuck out of the house, you know, not -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- having, ah, failed a test or something, but, yeah -- 
R:  [NOISE] Wow, ah, yeah.  I can't even [NOISE].  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  But, it's tough because then you think, "Okay, will I --" 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- divorce him because of the pressure of the marriage" -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, and the loss to the marriage.  And now I have two wonderful children.
R:  [NOISE] Oh -- 
L:  You know -- 
R:  -- well.  [NOISE] --
L:  -- so, then you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- think, "Well --" 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I might not -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have these --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- two children -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if I -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- had -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- tried to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- save that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- one".  And --" 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's what's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the hard part --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about thinking --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about what -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you would -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- change --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know -- 
R:  Yeah, because you never [NOISE] know how [NOISE] all the pieces [NOISE] fit together [NOISE] and --
L:  And what you're going --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to be giving up.  By --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- making that one -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  change.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah.  It's [NOISE] -- yeah [NOISE], I mean I [NOISE] -- 
L:  What's your --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- dog's -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- name?
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  His name is Sam.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] What is it?
R:  It's a Shitzu.
L:  Oh, okay.  We have a -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Jack Russell Terrier -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and a Staffordshire --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Terrier --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and they both get -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on my nerves -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all day doing --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- that same thing, so I'm -- 
R:  I don't know what's got [NOISE] -- what's in him -- 
L:  -- like, "Oh, you have one of those --"
R:  In the last [NOISE] couple of days [NOISE] he -- he's -- he had some [NOISE], um, [NOISE] ah, you know, allergy [NOISE] to fleas so I -- I gave him so prednisone[?] for the last couple -- about a week and a half -- 
L:  Oh, he's moody as all hell.
R:  Yeah, he gets -- yeah, he's really wired up.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, I was on prednisone for a long time and, I mean, he's -- he's just cranky, let me tell you -- 
R:  Ye- yeah.
L:  -- you're -- they called me, ah, doctor [MN] doctor Jekyll and Run and Hide.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's funny, yeah.  I [NOISE] -- 
L:  When I was on the stuff -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so [NOISE] -- 
R:  I've only taken [NOISE] that stuff [NOISE] twice in my life [NOISE] and I hallucinated --
L:  Don't, if you can ever avoid it.
R:  -- both [NOISE] times.  Well, I hallucinated seriously [NOISE] so they had to stop [NOISE] it, yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  I have metal --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- shoulders in both arms --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because of it.
R:  [NOISE] You have what?  [NOISE] What?  [NOISE] --
L:  Metal shoulders -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in both arms because of it.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.  [NOISE] 
L:  Steroid causes -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- brittle bones.
L:  It causes -- 
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- osteoporosis --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of the bones and I have -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- both my shoulders died.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.  [NOISE] 
L:  And -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- last November --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I stuffed up my backpack -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to go get -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- firewood and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- took a slip and shattered --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my leg into --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- fifteen pieces.  So -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah, the stuff is horrid.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my gosh.
L:  Don't ever take it if you don't have to.
R:  No.  No, I, ah -- no, I would -- I've -- I've seen my -- one of my close friends had really severe asthma [NOISE] and, ah, [NOISE] we would [SIGH] -- when he would go on prednisone we would just steer [NOISE] clear -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess.
L:  Yeah, y- you do.  You're just like psychotic, it's amazing -- 
R:  Yeah, he would get really [NOISE] mean.  He broke the [NOISE] steering -- ah, [inaudible] the windshield out of his car one day 'cause he was -- got so mad and -- 
L:  I'm not amazed if you just said that he ripped the steering wheel right out of the column, believe me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, he -- he th- I think sometimes he felt like doing that too and just that -- he just wh- wacked the steering wheel one day [NOISE] and just -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- I mean this -- the -- the windshield and just took it out.
L:  Yeah, it causes some real big emotional issues -- 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- let me tell you.  I'm -- I'm a witness to that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm, oh, yeah.  It's -- it's -- it's scary stuff.  I mean, when I took it the first time I was -- oh, gosh, I -- I guess [NOISE] I was probably [NOISE] ten years old [NOISE] or something for [NOISE] as- also for asthma and, ah, [NOISE] all I can [NOISE] remember is seeing men at the end of my bed trying to flip my bed [NOISE] over.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, or little men or something.  I don't know, but I mean -- 
L:  Yeah, it's wild stuff.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, um -- 
L:  -- it's very --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- wild stuff -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So -- 
R:  [NOISE] But -- 
L:  -- what would you change if you could --
R:  What would I change?
L:  -- go back in time?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's a, mm [NOISE] ... it's one of those things.  [NOISE] I -- I would probably change [NOISE] a selection of a doctor I made because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he ended up, um, hiring my [NOISE] ex-wife [NOISE] to be his office manager [NOISE] and then she divorced me and married him. 
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's a profound one.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That was a, you know, a bad -- 
L:  So, needless to say you lost your wife and your doctor?
R:  Yeah, yeah, it was a real nice -- nice deal.  Yeah, he, ah -- [NOISE] yeah, she moved out one day and just, "Oh, I'm going, I'm gone" and -- and then, ah, [NOISE] he called me up the same day and said, [NOISE] ah, "I -- I won't be able to have you as a patient anymore" and -- and, ah, yeah, they -- she filed for divorce immediately and [NOISE] the next thing I knew they were getting married.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How long had you been seeing this doctor?
R:  Oh, a couple [NOISE] of years. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  I -- he -- I g- I take it he was her doctor to then?
R:  No.  Oh, no, no [NOISE] we were all part of a church.  I'm a minister [NOISE]. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, ah, he [NOISE] got involved in our church [NOISE] to, um, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] well, you know, he just started [several inaudible words] the church and he started --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [inaudible] patients out of the church and then, ah -- 
L:  Networking.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what, ah, [LAUGH] --
L:  I mean, basically -- 
R:  -- now that would cause the -- yeah, and I was so sick that, ah, I had -- well, I didn't want this divorce and my -- my divorce attorney said that -- she said, you know, she was -- my ex-wife was the most vicious person she'd ever run across and her attorney -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- her and her attorney were the most vicious people she'd ever run across and that -- she said they're just -- they seem like they're trying to kill you.  And, ah -- and then after that happened, um, of course he did his thing, you know, and -- and I had a -- you know, potentially I had a huge malpractice suit.  But, um -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I talked to -- 
L:  Because of the ethics -- 
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- laws?
R:  -- yeah.  You know, this was in the eighties so -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, a lot of stuff was just coming to the forefront of this kind of -- this kind of malpractice, you know.  But -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I had two attorneys here in San -- in -- in -- in San Francisco that -- that would have taken the case in a second but they -- the guy called me up and he said, "Well, you know, when I talked to my partner" and -- and he called me back [inaudible] later and he said, "You know, we would take this case and we'd win it.  But" he said, "I think you'll die".
L:  Because of everything you'd been right through -- 
R:  Because my -- because my health and the amount of stress it would put on me.  Ah, he said, "I think it'd probably kill you" -- 
L:  I have to -- I mean, I was, um, involved because of me getting the, um, osteoporosis from the steroids -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was involved in a lawsuit.  A very indepth lawsuit -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for four and a half years on medical malpractice -- 
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- for the -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- lack of the right to an informed consent.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because the doctor never even explained to me what steroids were, what the risks -- 
R:  Oh, wow, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- were involved.  And at one point in my treatment I refused steroidal treatment because I told them, "This stuff is making me sicker than better" -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he changed the steroids and kept me on steroids.  Well, at the -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- end of the case -- yeah, he changed them so I wouldn't recognize what they were to shut me up, you know?
R:  Oh, man.
L:  And, ah, so I was involved in a lawsuit and it was just terrible.  It was devastating because you have to stay in victim mode the whole time you're involved -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And at one point the -- and I -- I was living in San Diego.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My first surgery I had done in San Francisco. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  My attorney had found the surgeon, Dr Harrington in San Francisco who was -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- world renowned for his joint replacements and stuff and I, ah, [COUGH] excuse me -- I went to the hospital over there in Cherry[?].  I can't think of what the name of it was now.  But, anyway, I, um, was all the way down to the wire two weeks before going to trial and my attorney felt outclassed because we had, like, the biggest in the San Diego county defence attorney in medical mal -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and so my attorney had another firm take it over because it wasn't his specialty.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And a week before trial there attorney came in and told me she wasn't taking me to trial, that she didn't feel my case was one hundred percent.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And so, a year later I had a firm hear about what had happened and they contacted me but we were just a little too late --
