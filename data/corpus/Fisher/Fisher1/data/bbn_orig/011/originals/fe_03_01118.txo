R:  Hi, my na- --
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi [LAUGH] my name is Edgar Wagner.
L:  Hi, Edgar, this is Dawn.
R:  Hi Dawn [LAUGH] how are you doing?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm doing pretty good.  This is my first time ever doing this, so bear with me.
L:  Same here.
R:  Same here?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, then.  Um, I think the question was, if we had an opportunity to go back and change some things and what would we change and -- and why.  Was that the question?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Would --
L:  And I can't think of anything.
R:  Well, I could think of a lot of things.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, you want me to go first?
L:  Yeah, you go first --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- A- -- actually, I can think of something, but you go first.
R:  Okay.  I'll go first.  Um, I think I would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- change, um, my perception of reality, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- yeah, um, as, um, I guess I could say this without being, um, bashful or anything, I'm a gay individual -- gay individual --
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm black, African American and, um, when I was younger I had a lot of problems with the -- the fact that I was gay, ah, I didn't realize that it was a problem until I got a lot older and that society viewed it as being, you know, wrong, or demeaning or, you know, that it was just a -- abomination to God and all that good stuff and I think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I would have changed my, I guess my acceptance or my, um, understanding of my lifestyle and probably embrace it, um, and -- and not give too much weight or too much emphasis on what other people, um, thought or viewed, um, but that's just a small aspect of me and I've been dealing with it for many, many years.  Um, I'd say that's probably about the whole thing I would go back and change.  Other than that, my life is good, I like the way it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I like who I am today, I like some of the things that I have done sort of, you know, to learn how to accept myself, but overall I'm pretty much, um, a happy person.  Okay.  You go [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Wow.  Well, mine's a little bit different.  I, um, well, I -- I actually have a couple of things, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one, the first thing that came to mind that I thought of is I -- I wouldn't have spent so much on my credit cards --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that I have to pay down now.
R:  Yes.
L:  I would have thought more or learnt how to -- listened to myself when I said, "No, you don't need this" but bought it anyway, basically.
R:  Mm.
L:  I think I would have changed that because, um, things would be a little bit easier now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and the other thing I think I would change is I think I might have listened to my parents when I was younger --
R:  Oh, girl [LAUGH].
L:  -- and, um, you know, you know, I'm -- I'm overweight by at least sixty pounds and I think I would have listened to them because I was an overweight kid --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, um, you know, realized they were trying to help me, even if they weren't doing it right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that I didn't have to deal with that.  Because I don't know how it's going to affect my health in the future.  I mean, I seem fine, I'm healthy now, but that doesn't mean it didn't shorten my life or hurt my heart that I don't know of yet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think I would change those, at least.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, now if I have a problem, I still have credit cards to pay down.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know [LAUGH].
R:  Well, you brought up two interesting, you know, topics on me, I mean, I can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can especially the last one, you know, my mom and I, we don't have a -- we don't really have a working relationship --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, basically I think what I did was I patterned myself around her, whatever she did I w- -- I'd try to do my darndest to do it twice as -- twice as better [LAUGH] um, and it caused a problem because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's a [inaudible] friction now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but now that I look back on it, you know, she was telling me not to do the things she was doing because she knew what kind of effect it had had on her life, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I wanted, you know, I guess I was looking for approval and I was looking for acceptance, so I thought if I patterned myself, you know, in her lifestyle, you know, I- -- I would be more acceptable and she's like, finish school, do this, stay away from that crowd right there, that crowd doesn't mean you any good and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm like, well, that's the same crowd you hang around with, so why should I listen to you, you know, saying, well --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- now that I'm older now and I look back on it, I think God, I should have listened.  My grandma was trying to tell me to save money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not spend on no credit cards, buy now pay later thingy and I figured that that thing I -- I -- I'm with you on that one right there.  If -- if I guess the older you get, for me, the older I get is a little more difficult to, um, save money --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and not buy into that buy now and pay later thingy because it's so convenient.  When you have a credit card in your hand, you got no cash, you know, you need something, something from the store, you need a new outfit or you -- you see something that caught your eye on TV -- TV is the thing for you --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's like, go get it.  You don't got to worry about it for thirty days, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, all of a sudden you just debt, debt, debt, debt, debt and that causes a lot of stress and a lot of anxiety because you like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- goh, see, I need to pay my rent, I need to pay my bills, too, so which one do I pay?  So --
L:  Exactly.  And like when I think of what I pay out now on the credit cards for the stuff that I've already used up, or, you know, went to the movies and don't even remember which one I saw --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, stuff like that or went to a restaurant where I didn't need to buy that or this, when I think that I'm paying now all this money that I could be using doing whatever I want with out of my paycheck --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it kills me.
R:  Yes.  Especially interest.
L:  But I don't to -- you know, I don't want to go through the bankruptcy thing like that because that throws ten years of even more hardship on you --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- and why do you have ten years of hardship where I wouldn't be making my credit better by paying instead of making it worse by throwing a bankruptcy for five years where nothing changes.
R:  True.
L:  You know, I don't want to.
R:  And no one's going to touch you after -- for those ten years, no one's they's -- they advertise, ah, we ignore bankruptcy, we ignore repossessions, they don't ignore that.  I've had --
L:  No, they don't.
R:  -- one car -- I've had one car repo, it's my first car ever I had -- I was -- I got it like in two thousand and one.  I had a nice car, a ninety eight Bueller[?] Sabre and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I got it.  And didn't know I couldn't pay for it.  I was working part time and I got a full time job and -- and I thought I could swing it and I didn't think about the -- I -- I -- well, I did include the insurance and all that, but I didn't -- I didn't include the speeding tickets --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  -- and the fines, you know, I didn't -- the parking tickets.  I didn't include all of that.  And I got a repo and, you know, these places say, well, we don't look at the repo and all, yes they do.  They do.
L:  Yeah, they do.  That's [inaudible] --
R:  They -- that's the first thing that comes up on my credit report, is the repo.  Everything else they're going to be looking at, and I'm like, god, if I had listened, saved my money, bought me a car, you know, we wouldn't --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have this problem today, but if you live and learn, but I am tired of living and learning, I want to -- already have learned.  You know what I'm saying?  
L:  Exactly.  And my boyfriend had a repossession from his divorce --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, his credit's now [inaudible] he's paying, you know, twenty this or twenty that on, um, credit cards, like percent or whatever.  And it's like, well, so am I, so why should I go through bankruptcy for all that when I may as well just pay them down and get better interest rates and like look like I'm paying?
R:  Definitely.  I think that -- I think that would be the best, the best bet because if you go to bankruptcy -- unless you got -- I heard that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what you do is -- this is probably illegal [LAUGH] -- once you accumulate everything you're going to get, the house, the car, whatever [inaudible] and then you go bankrupt, you know, you don't bankrupt not having these things already, you know, situated, ah --
L:  That's a good point [LAUGH].
R:  -- because -- yeah, [MN] you don't, you know -- you didn't have a house and a car, you know, it's like, what's the sense of, you know, saying, go bankrupt.  Um, because in a long way it's going to hurt you.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Because no one's going to take -- no one's going to take a risk with you.  No bank is willing to take a risk with you unless you put up some money.  And then it costs to go bankrupt.  It costs about five hundred dollars just to file for bankruptcy.
L:  Yeah.  I'd rather pay something with it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It's not -- it's not cheap to go bankrupt.  You've got to have money to go bankrupt --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I think that's a good idea, just pay what you can pay, you know, I don't think this how this [inaudible] is supposed to work, but [LAUGH] but, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think you're doing a good job.
L:  Yeah.  No, and I just -- I don't worry about what people think.  I -- I drive an old car, although it looks nice, and I keep it nice, but I drive an old car and my insurance is like eighty bucks a month, you know --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's cheap.
R:  You know, you must not be in Georgia, then.
L:  No.  I'm in Pennsylvania [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  Okay.  I'm in Georgia, I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.  So, and my insurance -- my insurance was cheap, my insurance was like, um, at first it was like one twenty, then it went down to ninety nine for full coverage [inaudible] ninety eight.
L:  Oh, that's not bad at all.
R:  Yeah, that was --
L:  See I don't have any of that like collision or anything, because it's an old car, you know.
R:  Oh, okay, you know, this is full coverage.
L:  And I got it for free.  So, it's like, okay.
R:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so you could -- you could afford to pay eighty dollars for insurance.  Definitely.  You got the car free, so you -- yeah.  That's cool.  I thought we'd been on here for twenty minutes now [LAUGH].  Look.
L:  Yeah, I wonder, do they tell you?
R:  Yes.  It's supposed to be a, um, a recording that lets you know your ten minutes are up.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I thought -- I thought we had talked ten -- I'm looking at the clock, getting -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm like, okay --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He had to wait for a while and I'm like in there and I'm like, are they not finding anybody, what's going on [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, actually, they had just actually called me five oh one, ah, because I told them after five o'clock and I was actually thinking they were going to call like maybe five thirty, six o'clock or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I had another call on the line and it was like, it was like maybe thirty seconds because they asked me did I have thirty seconds to wait
