L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE].  Hi.  My name's Laine[?].  I'm in San Francisco, California.
L:  Hi.  I'm Tracy.  I'm in Galena[?], Illinois.
R:  Hi, Tracy.
L:  Hi.  Is this your first time doing this?
R:  Um, this is my third call.
L:  Oh, great, okay.  This is my first time.
R:  Oh, great. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  So, a million dollars, but you can't speak to your best friend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ever again.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ... hm ... that's pretty tough because for me, I would probably say that my best friend is my husband.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that would mean there's no way I could take the million dollars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Unless I could say that my best friend was ... um, that my husband didn't qualify for that.
R:  Right.
L:  In which case, maybe I would take the million dollars.
R:  So, who'd be your best friend if it wasn't your husband?
L:  Um, that would be my friend, Karen, who I've known since high school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but we live pretty far apart now.  We do see each other fairly regularly but, I don't know, a million dollars might improve my life quite a bit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What about you?
R:  Well, um [SIGH] thinking about that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A million dollars, best friend ... hm ... um [SIGH] ... I don't know, I've had a lot of friends come and go out of my life in the last years and um, I think that even though it's sort of an abstract question about friendship and money, I'd take the million dollars because I have a lot of friends [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] uh-huh.
R:  And I [LAUGH].  I'd take the million dollars.
L:  You could afford to lose one.
R:  I could -- I -- I could maybe -- I think I could lose even a best friend for a million dollars.
L:  [LAUGH]  It sounds terrible, but it's probably true.
R:  Well, i- it's such an unrealistic question in the first place [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, I don't know --
R:  So, I'll take the million dollars! [LAUGH]
L:  R- -- yeah, yeah, if -- if I don't have to really tell my best friend that I ever did that!  [LAUGH].
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Right but, yeah but i- -- you know ... I don't know.  It's still kinda hard because it depends on whether ... if we're saying my true best friend is my husband ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Right and your husband isn't worth -- giving up your husband isn't worth --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a million dollars.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Plus he's sitting right here and uh [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But um, yeah.  No, I definitely wouldn't give him up for a million dollars but ...
R:  Yeah and I guess the difference for me is just that I don't um, have a particular lifelong best friend.  My -- my --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- best friends kind of shift as I change jobs and I move around and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- um, I'm not married and so, for me, the whole concept of, you know, having a million dollars and starting over again.  I mean, for a million dollars I'd even relocate. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Say, "Sure, give me a million dollars, put me somewhere else, I don't care".
L:  And you can find a whole new set of friends. [LAUGH]
R:  That's exactly right, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's a good idea.  Hey, maybe that's what this study is actually about.  Maybe they're just figuring out who they're going to give their million dollars to.
L:  Right.  That would be great. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right but um ... so, what would you do with your million dollars?
R:  What would I do with my million dollars?  Um ... well, I'm pretty conservative.  I think, what I'd do is, I'd um, invest about half and then take about a quarter and um invest in projects and charity ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the other quarter, I'd probably blow on travel 'cause that's what I really like to do.
L:  Oh, me too.  I -- I think I would.  If I had a lot of money, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of disposable money ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  It would go for travel, definitely.
R:  Mhm.  Where have you been?
L:  Um, we actually just got back from a little weekend trip, um, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we went to Las Vegas.  We had never been there.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  What'd you think?
L:  Um, we thought that it was really fun for the three days we were there but that we wouldn't want to stay much longer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We --
R:  I got trapped there once for a week and a half.  My car broke down and --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- I completely agree with you.  Las Vegas is a lot of fun for three days and it's just misery to be trapped there for longer than you want to be.
L:  I would imagine ... right.  I mean, once the novelty kind of wears off, it's -- it's strange.  Now, we did spend one day going out into the desert and -- and that was fun.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I suppose, you know, if -- if you're gonna incorporate longer desert trips in, you could spend the time there but ...
R:  Did you go up to the Valley of Fire?
L:  No.  We went to Red Rock Canyon.
R:  Oh, it's beautiful there.  I love Red Rock.
L:  Yeah, it was.  It was very nice and we went hiking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that was fun but um, yeah, as far as big, expensive, million dollar type trips --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um ... haven't done ... I'm trying to think ... we mostly pack up the kids in the car --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and drive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um ... long distances and we like to explore, so that's what we do.  My husband's a schoolteacher so we can take --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the time in the summer.
R:  Oh, that's really nice.
L:  But we have the time, we just don't have a lot of money, so that's where the --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- million dollars would be good.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's funny.  Living here in San Francisco, a million dollars just doesn't seem like very much.  A million dollars --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- could put me in kind of a normal house.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, where I am, it's a small town about three hours west of Chicago.
R:  You know, the funny thing is, you're the second person I've spoken to from Illinois.
L:  Oh, really?  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  Somehow, the study managed to tap into a whole bunch of people in Illinois.
L:  Huh, that's interesting.
R:  H- how'd you hear about it?
L:  I heard about it on um, an Internet list that I've been on.  Um, it's for parents who had babies in January of nineteen ninety seven, which I did.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And it's a group of mums who have been ... there's about thirty, twenty five of us, who have been on this list for over six years now.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And one of the ... one of them got it.  So, I think, probably three or four more people signed up but it's an international list, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not based in Illinois at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ... so, that was interesting, to -- to do it and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- this is the first ... we came home from this vacation and there was something like, twenty messages --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the answering machine from the study, so ...
R:  Right.  Yeah, I've had three calls today but you're the first one that's connected.  I've been on hold for ten or fifteen minutes each time and got tired of waiting.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think that ... the -- the ... it's sort of a slack time of the day. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In Illinois, you're just home for the evening, aren't you?  It's about five there?
L:  It's ... right, five o'clock.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, y- yeah, it would be an odd time.  People are probably traveling and so forth --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from work but ...
R:  [MN]
L:  So, are we supposed to talk for ten minutes?
R:  Um --
L:  Or do we just talk --
R:  Um, I --
L:  -- until we're done?
R:  Well, I've never made it through ten minutes.  Each time, we've run out of things to say [LAUGH] before --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  -- we get to the end of ten minutes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so, I've never waited ten minutes to see if the system comes back on and says, "You're done" or whatever.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, um, [LAUGH] we can hang in there a few more minutes, if you like, and see.  It might be kind of interesting.  I've been timing it this time.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We've been on the phone for five minutes.
L:  Oh.  So, we have --
R:  So, if we can make -- so, we can make it in --
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  We could -- we could make it another five minutes, I could find out whether the system actually tells you if you're done or not.
L:  Do you know if it's crucial that we stay on topic?
R:  Um, I think, when I read the original e- -- posting on the website, it said, you don't have to stay on topic.  You can -- they just want us to talk.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I think it's some kind of a language study about communication between people who don't know each other, that kind of thing.
L:  And maybe how off-topic we get, but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And we're pretty off-topic.
L:  Yeah.
R: We're meta topic now.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes, a million dollars.  What would I do more specifically with a million dollars, um --
L:  If you could -- if you could take ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... five hundred thousand of it and take --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one trip.  You have to spend five hundred thousand.
R:  On one trip?
L:  And you have three months to spend it.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Three months, that's not very long.  Um, I think I would ... well, 'cause I'm currently thinking about taking a trip to Italy.  I've got Italy on the brain, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Probably, what I would do is, I would rent a really good villa in Tuscany.
L:  Oh, wouldn't that be amazing.
R:  And then I would basically, just um, staff it with um, florists and [inaudible] and cooks --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then I would um, b- buy all my friends tickets.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then, we would just have an astounding Tuscan bacchanalia [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Isn't there a movie that's exactly that?  It's something like uh, eight or six women in a villa in Italy?
R:  I haven't seen it.
L:  I'm trying to think what it would have been called.  It's -- and it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- set, maybe a hundred years ago, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But uh, you need to find that movie maybe. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think I could probably spend half a million dollars on that pretty easily.
L:  Yeah, probably, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, for me, um ... that would be nice.  I think I would aim ... I -- I'd like to try and go to very exotic, maybe hard to reach, destinations.
R:  Like um --
L:  Like say, Pitcairn Island.
R:  I don't even know where that is.
L:  That's where um ... the ... you know the Mutiny on the Bounty?  Um, the -- the ship and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then they ... the mutineers went to an Island in the South Pacific and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- lived there and star- -- and all the people who live on this small Pitcairn Island are the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and local women there.
R:  Wow.
L:  And uh, you know, to get there, it's one of those places, kind of like Easter Island, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where you need to take many, many flights and there's one flight a week, kind of thing.  Uh, but that seems very interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those kind of far away places that just take a lot of money to get to.
R:  Mm.  Would you take your family?  Would you take your family or would you go alone?
L:  I would take my family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  My kids, even though -- my youngest is six but they're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're big travelers.  They're great in the car, they're great on flights and things, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... yeah, I would definitely take them, although it's nice to do a little thing like we did this weekend and go without.
R:  Mhm.
L:  As well.  Um, it's a good break.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ...
