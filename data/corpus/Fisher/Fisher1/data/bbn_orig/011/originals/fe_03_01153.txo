R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Janet.
L:  Ah, and I'm Anne.
R:  Oh, nice to talk to you Anne.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, thank you.  How are you this evening?
L:  Ah, I'm good.
R:  Good.
L:  I'm good.
R:  [MN] Well -- 
L:  This is a peculiar topic.
R:  [LAUGH] It is a peculiar topic.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I really don't have very many regrets.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, now, [MN] neither do I.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I don't -- I -- I really don't know what I would change.
R:  Well, let me try and think of something and maybe while I talk you'll be able to think of something too.  Um, [SIGH] if I could go back and change a part of my life I think I would have studied something different in college.  I studied English -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and graduated with my bachelors in English -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I like my -- I -- I -- I me- I met wonderful people in that course of study and I liked my major --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I almost wish I had studied, ah, geology.
L:  [LAUGH] Why ever? 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, because I want -- I -- I should have gone into gemology -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which is re- researching gemstones and -- 
L:  Now, that sounds much more interesting.
R:  Now, doesn't that sound like fun?
L:  Yes, it does.
R:  Play with sparklys all -- 
L:  I like that --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I -- I like those things.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's -- that's one thing.  I don't know if I would change it, but it was -- it's something that I've thought of before.  So -- 
L:  Well, yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I, um, went to nursing school.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I possibly would change that.
R:  What do you think you would have rather studied?
L:  Um.  I really don't -- well, I really should've studied accounting.  That's what I do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I do accounting also.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Isn't that funny?
L:  Right.  That is strange.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's what I should've studied but that's not what I did.  So -- 
R:  It think it's kind of funny that -- 
L:  It's kind of -- 
R:  -- you know what?  E- every -- [MN] you know, no matter what you study it still all comes down to the numbers, doesn't it?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause if -- if the numbers don't work, nothing else does.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so we feel at our company -- so, ah, you do accounting now.  Were you ever a nurse?
L:  No.
R:  Mm.
L:  No, I -- 
R:  So, you didn't.
L:  -- quit -- I quit nursing school and got married.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  But, I think I would have been better off had I gone to -- into a different field rather than nursing.
R:  Okay.  That's got to be a lot harder than -- than it looks.  I'm sure a lot of people go into it thinking it's one thing and then realising that it's another.
L:  It's a lot of hard work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lot of hard work.
R:  You've got to pay your dues.
L:  But, actually, um, but -- at -- the main reas- I was much more interested in getting married than I was in finishing school -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and at the time that I got married you could not be married and be in nurses training.
R:  No kidding?
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  So, that was the choice that I made, which I have not regretted it.  Not tomorrow, but the next day is my fortieth wedding anniversary, so -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's so wonderful.  Congratulations!
L:  [LAUGH] That was not a bad choice.
R:  No.  No. 
L:  In fact, that was a very good choice.
R:  Yeah, you -- you made a real life time decision there.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  But -- but had I chosen to study accounting I could have a degree.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  From a college rather than from the school of hard knocks.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, you can always go back.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  [LAUGH] No, no, no, no, no!
R:  [LAUGH] Isn't that funny?  Yeah, where I am at my work, see I -- you know, I have my degree in English -- I mean, I studied a lot of different things but, you know, my --  
L:  Right. 
R:  -- BAs in English and, ah, and now the place I am and the job I have, I think my company wants to send me back to school for an MBA with an emphasis in accounting.
L:  Well, that would be great.
R:  Yeah, I'm going to take advantage of it.
L:  I don't blame you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you certainly should.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My -- my dau- my daughter is, ah, in nursing school now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  She just started last year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She had, ah, three -- about three and a half years of -- of college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, she had -- after her second child, I guess, was born, she quit -- 
R:  Gosh --  
L:  -- school. 
R:  -- well, to have two kids and be in school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- holy moly.
L:  So she -- she's -- she quit college but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- her oldest one is now fifteen so -- and her youngest one is eleven, so she's gone back to school.
R:  Oh, good for her.
L:  And they're kind of on their own, you know.
R:  Yeah, they're old enough to be able to take care of the basics and -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- handle themselves -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah --  
R:  -- while mum's studying.
L:  -- they're good kids.
R:  Oh, well, good for her being -- 
L:  They're -- they're good kids and she worked and put her -- helped to finish putting her husband through school, so -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so, he said it was her turn now, so she's gone back.
R:  Goodness gracious.  She sounds like quite a lady.
L:  And she's really excited about it.
R:  That's wonderful.  So, she likes the nursing and she's going to stick with that?
L:  I think so. 
R:  Good for her.
L:  Yeah, she works in the accounting department where she works.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's hilarious.  I -- 
L:  Is that not funny?
R:  -- can't -- ah, gosh.  Well, you know, it really is where the money is.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I mean literally!  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is -- this is true.
R:  [MN] Oh that's -- 
L:  This is true. 
R:  Well, I think it's a good skill and I think accounting's a -- a skill that you pick it up with experience not necessarily from classes -- 
L:  Ah, you're right.
R:  -- well -- 
L:  You're right.
R:  -- everybody I know who's studied accounting ended up having to completely change their accounting why of thinking -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- when they went to work for their respective companies.
L:  Right 'cause it doesn't work the way the book says it does. 
R:  [LAUGH] No.  Everybody has a different method.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, there isn't any one standard way.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I guess it's -- it's good if you really want to get in to tax issues and -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, theory and all that stuff, but -- 
L:  Yeah, but we -- well, I just -- I just knew.  I'm not really an accountant, I'm a bookkeeper.
R:  Oh that's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's an accountant.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't -- believe me, I don't see much difference there.  I really don't.
L:  There's -- there's not a hell of a lot -- 
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  -- that I can see. 
R:  [LAUGH] Just a different -- different total.
L:  Oh, yeah, more or less, and a bigger pay cheque.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm interested.  How did you get signed up for this?  The [several inaudible words].
L:  Off the internet.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Me too.  I do secret shopping in my -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- spare time and I saw this -- 
L:  So, do I.
R:  Oh, you do? 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'll be darned.  And so -- 
L:  And where do you live?
R:  I -- I am in Olympia, Washington.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Where are you?
L:  Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  I'll be darned.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You're across the country.  I would love to visit Nashville sometime.
L:  Oh, really.  Well you -- everybody ought to come to Nashville at least once.
R:  Oh, well, gosh there's so much going on.
L:  It's -- it's a good -- it's a good place to be.  It really is.
R:  I'm sure.  I'm sure.  I'd also like to go to Memphis and go -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- through the Smokey Mountains.
L:  Well you keep -- you can keep Memphis.  I've lived there too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You -- you don't like Memphis?
L:  Ah, Memphis is not  what it used to be.
R:  Ah.  Yeah.
L:  Memphis is about seventy five percent black now.
R:  Oh.  You know, my sister visited there a couple of years ago and she said -- 
L:  If not more.
R:  -- she said it wasn't anything like she imagined.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not.  The crime is terrible there.
R:  No kidding?
L:  Yeah.  The crime rate is -- is really bad.  Um, there are places where if you are a white woman by yourself you don't go in Memphis and I've been gone from Memphis for thirty years.  There -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- were places like that when we lived there.
R:  Gee wiz.
L:  Mhm.  In fact, I got lost one day and stopped at a service station and got out one Friday and then I noticed after I'd been in there talking to the man that ran the station that I was the only white person in the vicinity.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He took me by the arm and he escorted me to my car -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he said, "Lady, get in and lock the door, and don't be caught down here after dark --" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- it's no place for a white woman".
R:  Well, for goodness sake!
L:  He said, "But I'm just telling you that for your own benefit".
R:  Well -- 
L:  And I said, "Well, give me my directions and let me get out of here".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you so much.
R:  Yeah, it's never anything you want to hear but, ah, at least he was, ah, kind enough to -- 
L:  Yeah, he wa- you know, he was a real -- a real nice fella and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it never occurred to me to be afraid.
