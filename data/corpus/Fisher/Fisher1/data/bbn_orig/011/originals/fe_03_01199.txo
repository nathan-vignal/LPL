R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Cathy.
L:  I'm Jill.
R:  Well, Jill, what do you think?
L:  I don't know.  I wasn't expecting that [LAUGH].
R:  No, I know.  I was expecting them to say something about a rat[?], too, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess I [LAUGH] ...
L:  That would be appropriate for today, right?
R:  They fooled us, ha, ha.
L:  Yeah.
R: [LAUGH]
L:  It's a -- it's a hard call.
R:  Yeah.  It really is, isn't it?
L:  'Cause ...
R:  [MN] Because your best friend is your best friend but a l- -- a -- a million dollars is a lot of money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, it is.  It's -- it ... maybe you could come across another best friend later [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I suppose for a million dollars, you might be able to do that and you know what?  You might find out that that person really wasn't your best friend.
L:  Hey, that's a good point.
R:  And if that was so, then you'd really, really be upset with yourself, wouldn't ya?
L:  Yeah, if you didn't take it, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I guess that's the only way you'd find out.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I can't think ... I don't know.  I don't know if I could give up a million dollars, even for a friend.
L:  I -- I would probably have to take it.  This --
R:  'Cause I think if it was -- if the shoe was on the other foot, that she would probably do the same thing, I would think.  I mean, I would expect her to do that, you know?  That's a --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I feel like I need to talk to all my friends and just let them know that if this ever happens ...
R:  -- [LAUGH] just in case you have a millionaire knocks on your door, right?
L:  Right, yeah, they should take the money.
R:  Really?  I don't know.  Well, I ... I just think that there's a lot of things that you could do with a million dollars but then on the other hand, gee ... you'd never have -- you could never speak to that person again, so ... I -- that is a really hard one.
L:  I wonder if you can send them letters?  Just explain why you can't speak to them any more.
R:  Oh.  It didn't say.  It said you couldn't speak to 'em.
L:  That's right.
R:  But that doesn't mean that you couldn't email them or you couldn't ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  ... like, yeah, yeah, you could email 'em a letter or you could tell somebody else and they could tell 'em.
L:  If you could just speak through somebody.
R:  And you -- and you could give 'em some money and then they probably wouldn't hate you.
L:  Hey, you could split it!
R:  There you go!  [LAUGH]
L:  That solves everybody's problem [LAUGH]
R:  There you go! [LAUGH] And then you could just always be friends through the email and -- and just not speak.
L:  That's right.
R:  Because that was the only thing, right?  Just speak.
L:  And with that much cash, you could get a really nice computer, so you know?
R:  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.  What would you do with a million dollars?
L:  I don't know.  I think uh ... maybe travel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Take time off and just ... just wander around the world a little bit, might be kinda fun.
R:  It'd be kinda scary right now!  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  I see, there, you have a good point.
R:  I guess, if we're looking at reality but we're -- we're not.  We're not looking at reality.
L:  Right.  It's all hypothetical.
R:  Because nobody's really give it to us, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, now, now I've got it in the back of my mind, you know, when is this person gonna call and offer me a million dollars [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I guess you must be more -- I must be more of a realist than you [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, apparently.
R:  I'm probably older than you.  That's probably why.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that'll come with time, huh?
R:  But if I did get it -- huh?
L:  That'll come with time?  I'll -- I'll believe that nobody is ever gonna --
R:  Uh, yes.  That comes with time but that's not what we're supposed to be talking about, so ... um, but I think -- I -- I think maybe -- yeah, I think maybe we've got it solved.  I think that would probably work.  I don't know if I'd give 'em -- I don't know if I'd give 'em half of it though.
L:  Well, some -- you'd give 'em some decent chunk.
R:  Yeah, I mean, out of a million dollars, you could give 'em just about anything [LAUGH] and they'd be happy, you know?
L:  I don't know.  If my -- if my best friend got the million bucks, you know, I'd -- I'd want at least a hundred thousand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Otherwise ... otherwise I think --
R:  You can never speak to 'em again, you know?
L:  I'd feel a little bit gypped[?] so ...
R:  Well, probably, I suppose.  Well, I suppose if I got it, I'd probably feel the same way.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've got a really, really good friend but I think she'd probably understand.
L:  Probably.
R:  Maybe not -- maybe not at first, maybe not at first.  Maybe she'd be really hurt but once she thought about the million dollars --
L:  I mean, once you put yourself --
R:  -- and then she got the check --
L:  -- in the other person's place.
R:  -- exactly.  I mean, that's really putting somebody on the spot, man.  I thought we were gonna be talking about something, you know, in the news [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] well, you know, that might actually be tougher.  I suppose, you know, they don't want any heated political arguments.
R:  Well, yeah.  I wouldn't want to be on the news and give my opinion, you know, or anything like that, just in case they [LAUGH] tape the clip or something [LAUGH].
L:  That's right, exactly but you know, it's fairly comfortable to give your opinion on whether or not you'd take a million bucks.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I feel a little --
R:  -- since it's not gonna happen anyway [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I feel a little guilty about -- about, you know, my decision to just sell out.
R:  Well, I don't think I'm gonna call her right up and tell her.  How 'bout you?
L:  No, probably not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, how do we talk about this for ten minutes?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I haven't been timing this so I have no idea if they just say, beep, you're done or what the deal happens.  Have you done this before?
L:  No.  This is the first one that's connected.
R:  Oh, me too, okay.  Well, um, let's see.  What else can we talk about with this because we really should stay on the subject?
L:  Well ...
R:  Um ... 
L:  Why is it an anonymous benefactor?  Kind of odd.
R:  Probably because somebody older used to watch The Millionaire.  See -- and you probably don't even know what that is do ya?
L:  No.
R:  Well, you see, there was this guy on TV who was a multi multi multi millionaire who would have this guy come knock on the door and would give somebody a million dollars.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  It was -- [MN] and then that was the process of it.
L:  That's a good show.
R:  And actually, that really probably -- maybe that doesn't have anything to do with it, I don't know.  [COUGH] They probably just want to see how long we can talk about this and still talk about the same thing which we haven't actually done [LAUGH].
L:  Well, we haven't been too bad.
R:  Well, no, we haven't been too bad.  You're right.  Um ...
L:  We're sticking with money [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I was trying to think of what I would do with it.  I probably would, like, uh pay my bills, I'd pay my mom's bills and I'd pay my son's bills and my brother's bills.
L:  Well, you're nice.
R:  Yeah, that'd be the first thing I'd do.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Get rid of the bills first.
L:  Paying everybody's bills.
R:  Yeah -- oh yeah, I would do that 'cause I know, if they got it, they would do that for me.
L:  That's very thoughtful.
R:  Family's family, you know?  And um, I of course, would have to give some to my friend [LAUGH] that I was no longer gonna speak to [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.  The one you can't speak to but you can buy nice gifts for [LAUGH].
R:  That's true.  You could, like, yeah, you could -- hey yeah, you -- instead of splitting the money, you could just, you know, do gifts.
L:  That's right.
R:  Now, that's a good idea.  That's a super good -- oh, that was good.
L:  You could pick out thoughtful jewelry [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, and she likes that too [LAUGH].
L:  Well, see, so it's perfect.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, your best friend is perfect for this scenario.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  She might actually be --
R:  How 'bout yours?  Is yours that good?
L:  Oh, I think she would understand.
R:  Not as good?  She'd understand?
L:  I think if I paid off her car ...
R:  Well, see.
L:  ... [LAUGH]
R:  Or you could buy her a new one or something.
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah.  That would be just like change or whatever.
L:  Well, I guess that's true.  It's so funny.  I guess the whole magnitude would change.
R:  Well, and you don't usually think in those terms of a million dollars, you know?
L:  No, certainly not.
R:  Um, but I think that we're -- we're supposed to be thinking about our friend, here, too.  Are you gonna change your mind or are you gonna keep it that way [LAUGH]?  I think I'm gonna stay with the million dollars.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Because there's just too many good things that you could do with it.
L:  It would [MN] -- yeah, and any opportunity is really only gonna come along once.
R:  And it -- well, yeah, if it ever did, that would only be one time, you're right.  If it came along twice you'd be really happy.
L:  That's right.  I'm -- I'm going ... yeah, especially if you got it multiple times [LAUGH] and you had to give up multiple friends.
R:  Yeah, that'd be cool.  Wouldn't that be cool?  Yeah, [LAUGH] then all of a sudden, you'd have no friends and you'd have lots of money [LAUGH].
L:  I think you have to have a balance 'cause it could be depressing to end up with no friends.
R:  Well, I think that would be terribly -- yeah, terribly depressing and since the stipulation was only speak to, as long as you didn't speak to 'em, you could even be around them.
L:  That would be tough, though.  
R:  Yeah, it would.
L:  I mean, can you imagine going to lunch and just --
R:  I mean, but you would probably be places where you would see 'em or whatever but if you'd already talked about it like on -- in emails or whatever -- I'm just trying to figure out how you can get around this and still get the money, you know?
L:  You could get those cameras for your computer so you can look at each other while you're emailing.
R:  Oh, there you go.
L:  And it would be almost --
R:  Almost like being together.
L:  -- like being together.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you have to wonder, if you get together and you talk, does somebody take the money back 'cause then you're gonna have a lot of bills.
R:  No kidding.  Well, they didn't say anything about that.  They just [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they -- they --
L:  So, now we're trying to figure out how to cheat.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  No, I'm not cheating --
L:  I have to wonder if this is typical [LAUGH] --
R:  -- I'm just trying to figure out how I don't completely have to, like, break the friendship.  I mean, they s- -- they've literally said, you just couldn't speak to them ever again.
L:  Right.  Probably meant more than that but --
R:  Well, maybe it did.
L:  -- we can take it literally.
R:  That -- [LAUGH] I'm very much a literalist, too [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's right, well, you know, if it -- if it helps you work around something, then ...
R:  [LAUGH] Sometimes it does.
L:  ... you gotta go for it, that's what I say.
R:  That's right, that's right, that's right.  Well, now that we're both minus one friend ...
L:  I know.
R:  ... and we uh both have a million dollars, where do you want to go [LAUGH]?
L:  Well, yeah, you're right that now is not a good time but --
R:  No.
L:  We could just uh rent an RV and drive across the country.
R:  Gee, that would be really fun.  I've always wanted to do that.
L:  I think it would be fun.
R:  Then you'd ha- -- then maybe you'd find a new friend [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Somewhere at a truck stop, we could find new friends [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [LAUGH] no, no, no, no, no, no, no [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, no.  Not at a truck stop.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know if that's a good place [LAUGH].  Maybe you could -- maybe you had a second friend that was your second best friend or something [LAUGH].
L:  That's right.  That's right.  They would [inaudible] --
R:  Or you could always take your husband or your boyfriend or whatever, you know?
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I wonder how much of the money my husband would think he gets to spend [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know.  Well, if you're the one that got it ...
L:  If --
R:  ... I guess it'd be yours.  You're gonna have to decide if you're gonna share it.
L:  That's right.  Well --
R:  I would think that if he's your husband, you probably would share it with him though [LAUGH].
L:  I would -- I would let him have a little bit of a say in the money decisions but --
R:  Yeah, well that's good.
L:  I get to overrule all decisions anyway.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  At least that's what he says [LAUGH].
R:  That's what you get for being a wife [LAUGH].
L:  That's right [LAUGH].
R:  That's because you're a woman.
L:  That's right but I'm not sure what the reason is but --
R:  I know, I know.  Well, let's see.  What else can we talk about, as far as this friend thing goes?
L:  I'm trying to think if I have any friends -- that's an interesting point.  If you consider your husband your best friend, then it would become tougher.
R:  Oh, now that'd be rough because then that would mean you'd have to, like, live separately.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Or get a divorce or something.
L:  I don't know if I -- to be honest, I don't think I could do that.  I think I'd have to give up the million dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It --
R:  For that, you probably would.
L:  It's too intertwined but for the best friend -- and my best friend is not even in the same town, so it's really, it's an easier problem for me.
R:  Oh, that would be easy for you then.
L:  Yeah.
