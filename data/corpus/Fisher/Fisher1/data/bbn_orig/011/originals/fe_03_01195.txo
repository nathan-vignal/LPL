R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Tracy.
L:  My -- hi, my name's Kate.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] Pleased to meet you.
L:  You too [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] so, what do you think?
L:  Um ... they said a million or a billion?
R:  A million.
L:  One million dollars to never talk to your best friend again.
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda tough.  I don't know.  I feel like it's really hard unless you really put yourself in the situation because I -- I mean, if someone gets offered, like, a million dollars, that's a lot of money.  That could set you up for a really long time.
L:  Yeah.  I ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  ... mm ... I'm trying to think, if I had a million dollars ...
R:  Like what you could do with it?
L:  Versus -- right -- versus the value of a lifelong friendship.
R:  And -- but also, like, how long have you known the best friend for, you know?  Is it someone that you grew up with since, you know, your -- since birth or, like, is this someone that, you know, you just -- like, got a new job and it's someone that you work with and you, like, all of a sudden became really close?
L:  Right.  Well, I think [MN] -- I -- I mean, we can only personalize it to ourselves and I think, if I were to pick, okay, so my best friend, mine happens to be somebody who I've known since I was born.  Our families are all ... my mom and her mom are best friends, they grew up together.  That's why we're best friends.
R:  Right.
L:  Spend holidays together, she is godmother of my son.  So, like, mine's unequivocally, "No".  I wouldn't take a million dollars to never talk to her again because, I think, in trading the value of what she's gonna bring to my life from now until whenever --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- like, it can't even be touched by a million dollars.
R:  Right.
L:  That's certainly not to say that I wouldn't be [LAUGH] extremely tempted.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  Um ... because I think about, you know, how many talks we've had, [MN] her and I about financial, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- hardships in our own lives and how it would -- how nice it would be to have money that would take those away.
R:  Right.  I mean, it --
L:  Um, how less stressful life would be [LAUGH] without um --
R:  But you're also assuming that if you have a million dollars that you'll be, like, happy after that but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, if you have a million dollars and you don't have your best friend, then, you know, how happy are you really gonna be?  You're always -- I feel like you'll always be contemplating, like, if you made the right decision, you know?
L:  Mhm [MN].
R:  And, like, a million dollars can only last so long.
L:  Yeah.  I agree because you -- and you're giving up a known for an unknown and although, you know, everybody in the world would like to have a lot of money.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ... you don't know what having a lot of money brings.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I also think ... at least I know that really, really good friends are not easy to come by.
R:  Yes, [MN].
L:  And those that are going to stick with you through the thick and the thin and to have already found that ...
R:  Mhm.  Yes.
L:  ... is a pretty, I think, big gift and if ... you never know what the money at- -- you know, what that money is actually going to bring to your life.  Is it going to bring, I mean, will it make my husband and I fight even more about [LAUGH] money?
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, you know, --
R:  No, it's true because you have to think about every aspect.
L:  Right.  Um --
R:  And it might not make you happier to have all that money.
L:  Right and it's a total unknown as far as, what would that actually do to my life?  The other part I think about is um -- that -- look, I haven't ever given -- I probably won't ever give up the hope that perhaps I'll make that type of money [MN] on my own.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I don't know [LAUGH] doing what.  Maybe I'll invent something, maybe I'll win the lottery, maybe I'll --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get some job that ends up being the next president of a huge company [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- you never know.  So, I always have a possibility that that might exist, but I don't know if I could ever find a friend that would replace her.
R:  Exactly.  It's true.  I feel like everyone's always looking for quick money, though, you know?  Not many people think about it like that.  I don't know.  I mean, do you think that most people would take the million dollars?
L:  [SIGH] I think it [MN] really depend on if you have somebody that you consider your best friend.  I think there's a lot of people --
R:  True.
L:  -- in today's society who don't have someone that they necessarily consider -- with people in today's society, people move a lot, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't live in the -- I mean, I don't live in the same -- I've lived in at least twenty five towns.
R:  Right.
L:  And you know, I don't have real deep roots and so to me, to have somebody that I even know in this country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from the birth, is really important to me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't know ho- -- I don't know.  I mean, I guess it depends on where you are in your life as far as your friendships.  If you're somebody who has a lot of friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, and you're a very social person.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- maybe you don't have one who you consider your best friend and losing one wouldn't necessarily make a huge difference in your life.
R:  Right.  But then -- but if it's your best friend, I feel like it will make a difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, regardless if you have, like, a million friends, you know?  Like, if you lose your best friend, it will always make a difference, even if you have a lot more, you know, um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  It's hard.  I've ... I've -- I'm -- I'm a very social person.  I have a lot of friends and I've been in situations, like, I've gone, um, abroad and -- for five months and I did not find any friends whatsoever that compare at all to the friends that I have at home and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess, like, thinking about that, I really don't think that I would take the money because, I mean, I'm also not really that much of a superficial person, you know?  Like, I don't need a million dollars.  I'm happy ... you know, I'm content with, you know, what I have, especially, you know, I just -- I really learned the value of a friendship, you know?  If you have a million dollars and you don't have the companionship that you need, then it really doesn't matter.
L:  Yeah.  I think to be ... yeah, I think you're right on being alone and having money.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You know, money could probably buy you friends but what do they really ... what are they really there for?
R:  They wouldn't really be your friends.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  I don't know.  It's hard.  I've actually -- I've heard that about um ... I saw something on TV about, um, famous people and how they have entourages and how they pay for all their friends to, um, you know, like, go out for dinner and stuff and the reason that they do that is because they say, like, there's no point in having wealth if you can't share it with people, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  There's no point in having all the money if you don't have anyone to share it with.
L:  Yeah.  I wonder if -- if that's it?  Like, if they ... or if they're just ... they -- because of the lifestyle that they lead, they -- it has a really hard ... I've heard a lot of celebrities say it's really hard to figure out who your true friends are because when the money comes rolling in ... like Oprah and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, really wealthy people say, you know, it's hard to figure out who your friends are.  Usually, it's the one that was there before they mone[?] came rolling in because once the money's there, you never know what the true motives of somebody hanging round you is.
R:  Right.  Yeah [MN].
L:  And certainly -- and -- I mean, a million dollars wouldn't come close to putting you on that stature, I mean ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... a million dollars today is not --
R:  It's really not that much [LAUGH].
L:  -- not ... right.  I mean, not like I'd turn it down if somebody wanted to give it to me for free [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But ... you know, I mean ... 
R:  It's true, it's true.
L:  It could --
R:  M- most people that get money that quickly like, say, people that win the lottery, end up just spending it ridiculously, you know and today, you never know.  You can invest it in the stock market and have nothing [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  You'll end up without the money and the best friend.
L:  Right.  Yes.  I mean, you could get yourself out of debt, buy a nice car, buy a nice house and pretty m- -- and after taxes, you've pretty much spent it [LAUGH].
R:  Right, so ...
L:  I mean, you know?
R:  Yeah.  It's also -- I don't know, it depends on age also.  I'm only twenty two.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I don't really know what it's like to support myself.  I'm still kind of living with my parents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... I mean, it's ... you know, if you're like -- how old are you?
L:  I'm almost thirty.
R:  Okay.  Like --
L:  And I'm married and I have one child, a seventeen month old son.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ... yeah, it's prob- -- you're exactly right.  I mean, it's a very different perspective of where you are in your life.  I mean, like, if my husband and I could get ourselves out of debt and simply live on what it was that we made, we could live an extremely nice lifestyle.
R:  Right.
L:  If we didn't -- you know, if we weren't in debt and -- I mean, a million dollars, we could put money away for our son's education.
R:  Mm.
L:  We could easily have another baby without h- -- you know, concerning ourselves with finances.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ... but, like I said, I mean --
R:  It's still not worth it.
L:  -- the -- the actual person that I think of when somebody says your best friend ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... is so entwined in our lives that taking her out of it by not [LAUGH] speaking to her again --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- first of all, she'd never forgive me.  She probably wouldn't want to speak to me again either.
R:  I know, exactly.
L:  I mean, okay, yeah, I chose you over money.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or I chose money over you.
R:  The money over -- yeah.
L:  That's not a very [MN] uplifting thing.
R:  Yeah.  And it doesn't say much about you as a person [LAUGH].
L:  No.
R:  If you're gonna do that, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... 
L:  Have you done this phone survey before?
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  I haven't either.  This is my first time.
R:  Oh, it is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know if we're just, like, supposed to keep talking?
R:  I think that there's supposed to be, like, a beep.
L:  Oh?
R:  Um ... but have we been talking for ten minutes?
L:  Yeah 'cause my phone says eleven twenty five.
R:  Really?
L:  Eleven minutes and twenty five seconds, yeah.
R:  And they said um ... I think that we really only have to talk about the topic for eight minutes.  We're allowed to, like, introduce ourselves for two minutes [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Do you think we're good?
L:  Oh.  We did the int- -- we did the introduction at the end.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I have no idea.
R:  Um ... I don't know.  I don't even know what else ...
