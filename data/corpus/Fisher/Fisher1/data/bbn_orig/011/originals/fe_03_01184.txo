R:  My name is Molly, also known as Omilara[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Gary.
R:  Hi.  How're ya doing?
L:  Pretty good and how are you?
R:  I'm fine, thanks.
L:  Good.
R:  Okay.  Well, it [MN] -- I found out, to be a little bit humorous.  I think I would have to have a very large fight with my friend if I was never to speak to her again. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Yes, definitely.
R:  Um, but I'd say if -- for a million dollars, I don't think I would do it.  First off, a million dollars right now isn't that much.  Anyone, over their lifetime can amass it or earn or if you're really lucky, get it in the lottery or by stockmarket.
L:  Right, but good friends are hard to find, right?
R:  That is true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And fr- --
L:  But for -- with a million dollars, perhaps you could find another friend.  Who knows?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  See, I got -- it's interesting you mentioned that but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'd say, with friendship, no.  I think, the experiences that you get, I think, kind of take over that whole desire to get, like, a million dollars.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, what would you -- what would you do with it, you know?  I mean, if you got a good friend, that means a lot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but sometimes money doesn't necessarily buy you friends or happiness.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm glad we agree on that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, we could disagree to agree, or something like that, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Now ...
R:  But if [several inaudible words], with a million dollars, I wouldn't even know what I'd get.  Most likely, I would think of sharing it with my friend.  Actually, no I --
L:  That makes sense.
R:  -- No, I wouldn't. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, what good is money except unless you share w- with your friends, yeah.
R:  True but I'm thinking, wait, that I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't do that immediately [LAUGH] to do --
L:  No, you'd spend most of it first, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]  I imagine my mum would probably do it for me. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, of course, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  Not bad, though.  I don't know, like, if you had a million dollars, I don't know if I'm supposed to ask questions here, what would you do with it?
L:  Oh, I think we can talk about anything we want to.  Oh, well, you know, you could do all those things that you wouldn't normally think that you would do otherwise, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Maybe travel or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  I'd want to travel to Thailand.
L:  Thailand?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've heard so many good things about that place.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What have you heard?
R:  The- they have great food --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and it supposed to be the healthiest.  It's one of the um sub South Asian countries that aren't really -- don't really have as many, like, problems of the economy, political, war ... that kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The people there are so nice.
L:  That's what I've heard.
R:  Oh, really?  You s- --
L:  And money goes a long way.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  You're really into the whole [LAUGH] money argument, aren't you?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  No, but I've heard there's a -- a lot of cultural things there and most people really don't know about it and it's something you normally wouldn't do and it actually costs quite a ... it actually ... actually, it's really not that bad to go over there but you might not go unless you'd suddenly acquired instant wealth or something like that.  [SIGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah and I was -- I was thinking, well, maybe I'd go to New Zealand but I could always go via Thailand, I suppose, you know?
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a pretty good idea, actually.  I have a professor right now who's from New Zealand.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah, I do, in marketing research but he's -- he's really nice.  That's the closest to Australia that I can think of but I think New Zealand -- I don't know, when I think, New Zealand ... you know, Xena, Warrior Princess?
L:  Yes.
R:  You know how it was filmed in New Zealand?
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, so that's why you want to go? [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mostly because it has uh ... the geology is so much different.  You can go from, like, mountains to, like --
R:  Like ... right --
L:  -- really volcanic land to --
R:  Really?
L:  -- uh, and it's not very populated.  At least, the South Island isn't.
R:  That's true.
L:  And it's still relatively ... well, there aren't as many people there and it's more ... you could do, like, really long hikes and things like that, so it'd be more uh, a peaceful type of thing and it would be like uh, Britain, in that you'd have, like, little ... you know, those little quaint villages things?
R:  Mm.
L:  But, then it's different in that you have lots of countryside.
R:  [NOISE].  That's true.  I can al- -- I can almost imagine living there.  It'd be so nice.
L:  Yeah, so does your prof talk much about it?
R:  Um, rarely.  He puts in a few um, jokes about, like, New Zealand and a few facts here and there and how he was -- he's into the ballet that's there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't even know there -- but I suppose there would be, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It makes sense. [LAUGH]
R:  No, like ... I -- I think he's been in the United States for a long time.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But he -- he still has the accent, so I think he goes back very often.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that makes sense.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and how did you just hear about Thailand?
R:  Um --
L:  I mean, some of your friends?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, see, there you go!  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You wouldn't have known, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they've been, right?
R:  Pardon?
L:  They've been to Thailand?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, one is actually originally um, a Thailand guy.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But he actually was very interested in going initially before because he had been adopted by, uh, I think, American parents.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, he wanted to go back and when he did, he -- he could not stop ranting about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's pretty good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN].  Just watching on, like, TV shows too, I'm like, ooh, Thailand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've always wanted to go.
L:  So, you should go anyway, even if you, you know, don't inherit lots of money.  You should just ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When are you going?
R:  When?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, when?
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I mean, if you dream about it, you should live your dreams, right?
R:  Well, that's true but in terms of a timeline for that, I have absolutely no idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well ... I don't know.  Maybe when I'm ... before I have kids.
L:  Well, that's probably a good idea, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, probably like, my mum always tells me that, like, when she was young, she used to go, like, grab all her friends and go travel different places and I think it's more p- possible now to do that, since everything's closer and more global.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, maybe I can convince a few people to go to Thailand. [LAUGH]
L:  I think you should.  You know, this uh, call could be like one of those catalysts that just change everything, right?
R:  Right.
L:  You start off on one conversation and then suddenly, you discover that you really want to go to Thailand, so you shouldn't really think about it too much and you should just do it, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even if it doesn't cost a million dollars?
L:  Ev- even if it doesn't, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  Mm ...
L:  Oh.  So, okay, so you've got the ... the land, the people, uh ... I mean, what would be the best -- is Bangkok, Bangkok's in Thailand, right?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Yeah.  So, would you go there or would you go, like, out in the country, or would you go, like, to the coast or --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  'Cause there's some really cool islands aren't there, that you could go kayaking, through?
R:  Oh, wow, that's true.  Actually, I tried kayaking once and I loved it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Have you ever kayaked on the Hudson?
L:  Oh, no.  No, I haven't.
R:  Oh.
L:  Have you?
R:  Yeah, that's where I kayaked.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's very unusual, since everyone, like, is -- when they think the Hudson, they're like, oh my gosh, what a dirty river.
L:  Well, actually, I think I saw something about -- they kind of cleaned it up a lot.
R:  Right.
L:  Like uh ... and they built this uh ... boat ... like Pete Seger[?].
R:  Oh.
L:  He built a boat.  It was like one of the old ones that used to go up and down the coast and that's how they got it started about cleaning everything up.
R:  Wow, that's a pretty good idea.
L:  So, when you did it, I mean, you found some really neat places, huh?
R:  Yes, I did.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN].  Normally, you think of kayaking as, like, rapids and stuff but ...
R:  Right.
L:  ... then again, I suppose it's like uh ... it's something that you could really explore and it's pretty convenient to do that.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Huh ... so, did you have lots of friends that went with you?
R:  Um, about two.  My friend who introduced it to me, Jerry[?].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And his other friend.  That was about it, though.
L:  Oh.  I think that's a good group, you know, you don't want to get too many.
R:  Yeah, no, I can't imagine a whole group of us going kayaking, a bit too rowdy.
L:  Oh.  Oh, perish the thought. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, you're going again?  You going kayaking again?
R:  Oh, as soon as I get the chance, yeah.  When I go back to New York.
L:  Oh, you aren't in New York now?
R:  No.  I'm in Philadelphia now.
L:  Oh, well there you go, okay, not -- I don't guess there's too many places to kayak around Philadelphia, right?
R:  Oh, that's a good point, although I'm always too busy to, like, go figure out where to go, like, up and down the Skucool[?] or some other river.
L:  Yeah.  So, is that river -- how's that river for navigability or, like, pollution or things like that?
R:  Uh, for the Skucool, you mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm actually not that sure.  I figure it's -- it's slightly cleaner than the Hudson.
L:  Okay.
R:  But comparability, not that much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I know there's this very beautiful spot by the Skucool that you can go to where I see people kayaking every now and then.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah and it's -- it's really -- I don't know, I like it but I don't think -- I don't know, I -- I'm do- -- I'm not a fan of Philadelphia that much.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, to go over to the Skucool and rent a kayak and go up and down it when I'm not too familiar with the area ...
L:  Sure.
R:  ... I wouldn't really, like, be encouraged to go there and do that.
L:  Oh?  Well, maybe, you know, when you're out and you see those kayakers, you should strike up a conversation.
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah, yelling out all across the bank. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN].  And you could go, "You know, if you had a million dollars, would you be kayaking right now?" you know!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then, see what ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then [LAUGH] and then this could change your whole idea about what it's really like, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Why not!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  And how big is this Skucool or, how do you pronounce that exactly?  I mean --
R:  The Skucool.
L:  Skucool?
R:  Yeah.  It took me a while to get it, too. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But --
L:  'Cause I -- I've seen it, I think, and I've read about it but not had a conversation where people actually wanted to pronounce the words correctly, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH].  So, a single kayak?  A single person kayak?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, I think, about as -- it's about as tall as a normal guy, maybe ... no, actually, a very tall guy, maybe six feet.
L:  Okay.  Was this the kind where you're sat in or you're sat on?
R:  I sat ...
