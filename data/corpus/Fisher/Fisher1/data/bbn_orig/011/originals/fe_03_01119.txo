L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  This is Rhona Atwater.
R:  My name is Rachel.  I'm in California.
L:  Hi, Rachel.  I'm in California as well.  Where -- whereabouts are you?
R:  I'm in Stockton.
L:  Stockton?  I'm in Los Angeles, just outside of Los Angeles.
R:  [MN].  Um, I'm nineteen.
L:  Oh.  You're young enough to be my daughter.  I'm forty three [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.   [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  So, do you want to start, or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.  If I could go back in time, well I had a daughter when I was sixteen and I love her and she's -- it's great having a daughter, but if I could go back in time, I think I would wait and have her later because it's, well, very stressful, very hard to have a child, that young.  So, that's what I would do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- if I could go back in time and change anything.  But I mean, if I could have the same daughter again --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just later.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.  So, why -- why, um, do you -- are you raising your daughter by yourself?
R:  Um, she -- she sees her dad on the weekends but mostly by m- -- I mean, I have her during the week all by myself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my mom help -- my parents helped me out when I was younger but when I turned eighteen I decided that I wanted to move and so it's just been me and her for the last year.
L:  Yeah.  Wow.  Very good.  Okay, so, what would I do if I could turn back time?  I think I probably would have listened to my parents a little bit more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my parents always told me to save money, you know, no matter what, even when I was a -- a clerk at a Safeway Supermarket, you know, they'd tell me, put ten dollars a week away, you know, put --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- any extra money that you have away in a bank account and used to tell me how well off I could be when I reach forty or fifty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, unfortunately I didn't listen to my parents and, um, you know, I have a full time job and I'm doing quite well, but, um, I, ah, wish I would have listened to my parents and -- and done that, you know, it would have made things a lot easier because I have two little kids, too, I have a -- a six year old and an eight year old and --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- things are rea- -- really expensive, you know, putting them --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, in after care at school and in the summertime, summer is so expensive if you, you know, if you don't have someone at home to watch your kids.
R:  Yeah, there [NOISE]
L:  You know, we're paying eight hundred dollars per child to -- to, you know, to keep them occupied during the summer for the summer months and it's really hard.
R:  [MN] My gosh.  My mom watches my daughter, so it -- that cuts back on some expenses.  But it's still expensive to have a -- a -- kids, buy clothes --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for them and all that stuff.
L:  Yeah, well, you know, it's funny.  When you have one child you, um, [inaudible] you think well having a second child isn't going to be much more of an expense but, you know, when they start to get older -- it's fine when they're babies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they're toddlers, but when they get older and you have to, ah, feed them the same food that you're eating and you know, you're -- you're paying -- paying, ah, double for everything, you know.  We can't go to Sizzler and -- and have them eat the salad bar for free, we have to pay for them now, so --
R:  [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, it does get expensive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, what -- what else in the past would you change?  Anything?
R:  Um.  I think I'd probably listen to my parents, too, just -- just so I didn't give them such a headache when I was younger [MN] with my father --
L:  Yeah, actually I -- I was -- I was pretty rebellious myself and I think I gave my, ah, my parents a very big headache --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, it's funny, you -- you think you know everything when you're growing up and you really know --
R:  Yeah, I did too.
L:  -- nothing and -- and I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- I tell my six year old daughter all the time, 'cause she, you know, she talks back quite a lot 'cos she thinks she knows everything and I have to keep reminding her, you know, Alex, you're six years old and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm forty three and I've been around a lot longer than you have, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and she says, "Oh, mom" --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- yeah, it's funny.
R:  I think that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] I don't know, I think that I -- if I would have listened to my parents more then I wouldn't have, maybe I wouldn't have had my daughter so early and [SIGH] I don't know, things would have changed, but everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- worked out still good.
L:  Yeah.  Kids are great, though, they really are.  They, you know, it's -- I -- I look forward to seeing them everyday when I pick them up from school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, at the end of the day.  They are -- they're just so funny [NOISE] yeah.  But I'll tell you, one -- one thing I would change, probably, if it wasn't for the kids, I wouldn't have got married to my husband --
R:  Oh, oh.
L:  [LAUGH] That's something that I would have changed.  I got --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I got married, um, we only knew each other for six months and, ah, you know, and then we got married, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you really don't know someone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, when you've been with them for six months.  I think you need to know them a couple of years before you get married --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because you don't really know their habits --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unless with you've lived with each other for a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- good amount of time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, when you start living together --
L:  But, um --
R:  -- they irritate you [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  All those little things.
L:  Yeah.  Stupid things like the way you brush your teeth or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, yeah, just really silly things.  Yeah.  So, are you online with forum?
R:  Am I what?
L:  On -- on -- how did you come about to do the Fisher project?
R:  I -- online.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, online.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  Someone, um, posted the phone number on a, ah, a chat -- not chat, but a, ah, a forum --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- one of these mystery shopping forums --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  So, you're not part of that group?
R:  Um, no, I just -- I actually have a em- -- a -- an -- I subscribe to a newsletter that sends like, sends you surveys and stuff that you can do and it was on there, so I just went to their website --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and signed up for it.
L:  Yeah.  Very good.  And where is Stockton?
R:  Stockton is, um, well, you know were San Francisco is, right?
L:  Where where?  Oh, San Francisco, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  San Francisco is.  It's, um, probably forty five minutes north of San Francisco.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  It's in the -- it's in the valley.
L:  Very good.  Yeah, it's beautiful --
R:  Between San Francisco and Sacramento.
L:  -- up there, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.  It's hot.  It's nice up here, though.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very different to -- to LA.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it -- it's so green up there, it's amazingly green --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was up in --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- San Francisco last year, um, with my mom visiting a friend of hers and, ah, I couldn't believe the, ah, you know, the -- the threes, how many pine trees there are up there and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just, you know, just so much more foliage than here.
R:  You've always lived in LA?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I -- I'd have a very hard time leaving -- leaving here because this is where my family is, so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think I could leave.  I mean, it's nice here.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's in -- it's -- there's a lot to do and a lot to see and, you know, there's a lot of nice people out here.  I'm actu- -- I don't live in LA, I live in Santa Monica, which is just, um, it's a coastal city.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, you've heard of Venice Beach?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's right next to Venice Beach, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- um, yeah, in between Venice and Malibu, so it's a -- you know, it's a nice, really nice area [LIPSMACK] yeah.  So, I'd have a hard time leaving [LAUGH].  What about you?
R:  [several inaudible words] I used to live in the Bay area, I used to live in, um, San Jose, and then we moved up here because it's a lot cheaper up here than it is, you know, in the silicon valley --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and so we moved up here.  I've been here since I was, um [LIPSMACK] I don't know, probably thirteen or fourteen and the only thing I miss about being down there is the beach 'cause we -- you could go to the beach when you're down there pretty, about thirty minutes and it's a long time to go to the beach 'cos it's more in -- not near the coast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's hotter here, 'cause too you're not by the ocean.  So [SIGH].
L:  You know, at the place that we went to up in, um, um, outside of San Francisco was Lafayette --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  And that was a beautiful, beautiful town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, I -- I probably wouldn't mind moving up there just for a little while, but I'd -- probably end up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- coming back to Los Angeles [NOISE], yeah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, h- -- how long do we have to stay on the phone?
R:  I don't know.  [inaudible] I think --
L:  Is someone --
R:  -- fifteen minutes --
L:  -- does someone come on the line and tell us that we're f- -- that we don't have to talk anymore?
R:  I don't know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- whether they just let us talk forever until we decide.
L:  Yeah, so i- --
R:  I think -- I think they probably tell us.
L:  Oh.  So, Rachel, um, where do you work?
R:  Um, I work at a -- it's funny that you said Safeway clerk, because that's what I do, I'm a -- a, um, clerk at Safeway, right down the street.
L:  Oh, you're kidding?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, isn't that funny?
R:  I work full time.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I used to be -- I used to be a bagger.  I used to bag groceries when I was your age, when I was nineteen, twenty years old.  Yeah.  And, ah, yeah, they made pretty good money back then.
R:  Yeah.  I'm like -- I make pretty good money now.  It's -- [inaudible] union, so that's --
L:  Yeah.  Well, that was a plus, you know, being in the union was definitely a plus because we -- we had to go on strike when I -- when I worked there --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  -- and, ah, yeah, and, ah, we were on strike for about two months [NOISE] --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and, you know, I ended up going back to work and making about a dollar more an hour, that was about it.
R:  Do they -- do they --
L:  But --
R:  -- do they pay you still when you're on strike?
L:  Um, you know, they don't -- didn't pay you a hundred percent, they paid you I think it was like seventy or seventy five percent that you'd get paid, you wouldn't get paid your full wages.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, you know, but they expected you to go stand out in front of the store with a picket sign and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, yeah, so, you know, when you're young, when you're your age, you know, it was sort of exciting and different --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, yeah, but, ah, yeah, it was fun.  I loved working there.  It was a really fun job --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, we met some really fun, very nice people and also dealt with a lot of weird people too.  Yeah.
R:  I like it there 'cause -- 'cause you get to talk to a lot of people.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great dealing with, ah, with the public, dealing with customers.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  So, how old is your daughter?
R:  She's three.
L:  Your daughter's three?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what's your daughter's name?
R:  Brittany.
L:  Brittany.  Oh, that's a nice name.
R:  Thanks.  W- -- how -- your kids are six and eight?
L:  Yeah.  Mine are six and eight.  I have a boy and a girl.  My, um, son
