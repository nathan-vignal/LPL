L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Lauren.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  I'm Purlee[?]
L:  Hi.  And, what -- what is the answer to your question? [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh ... that's a hard one [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A million dollars is a lot of money.  Um ... well, I'll -- I, you know, that'd be kinda hard.  I don't -- I don't think I would take it [MN].
L:  I don't think so either.
R:  No.
L:  I think a good, close, bonding friendship is a lot harder to come by.
R:  Oh, yeah, most definitely.
L:  And ... you know, I -- [MN] if you'd asked me the question twenty years ago with the way people have moved on and done things with their life, yeah, I -- I probably would have said, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But with the way things are in the world [MN] today, no, I wouldn't do it.
R:  No, no and -- and money -- money is a big issue with a lot of people, but I think, you know, to have a best friend that you can talk to as a -- it means a lot, it really does.
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  It really does.
L:  I definitely agree.
R:  It really does, so [MN] I don't think I would take it either [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] How old are you?  
R:  I'm -- I'm thirty nine.
L:  See, I'm thirty seven.
R:  Are you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh and your name was Laura?
L:  Lauren.
R:  Lauren.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you from, Lauren?
L:  I live in Michigan.
R:  Do you?  Okay.  I'm in Mississippi.
L:  It sounds like it.
R:  [LAUGH] You can tell, huh?  I --
L:  I had a aunt that lived in Gulfport.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's not very far away, probably about seventy miles.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm in Hattiesburg, so I- -- I'm fairly close to Gulfport.
L:  I -- I've been there [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay, great, great.
L:  Purlee, I take it, you have a best friend?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I take it you have a best friend?
R:  Yeah, I do, I do and I -- I talk a good bit [MN] it means a lot to have somebody to talk to.  That ... I've gone through a -- a good bit of stuff this past year so ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... to talk to someone, means a lot.
L:  I have um ... my -- my best female friend, uh, we met the last day of college ... uh, our last class, last year, last day and we had seen each other in the same classes before but we had never spoken to one another, so we were sitting on the hoods of our cars which were parked right in front of each other, talking for about three hours.  We exchanged phone numbers and addresses and we never saw each other again.
R:  Oh, [MN].
L:  But we have talked on the phone and written and emailed for fifteen years.
R:  Wow.
L:  L- like we're best of friends [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.  [inaudible]
L:  [COUGH] Every day, almost, it seems like.  She -- and it- it's kinda funny 'cause we're both the same age ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... and we've never been married but she has um, she has a dog and a -- and a father and I have my son and my cat.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  So, you know, we ... every time she had a boyfriend go sour, so did I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- jumped on the phone, cry, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  [several inaudible words]
L:  Have chocolate over the phone, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I met my fiance, um, about a year and a half ago and he's my best male friend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I couldn't give either one of them up for all the money in the world.
R:  Well, no, no, wouldn't want to.
L:  [MN]
R:  Sounds like you have gotten everything together, got your fiance.  How -- uh, how long have your known your fiance?
L:  A year and a half.
R:  A year and a half.
L:  Yes.
R:  Wow, that's [MN].
L:  One of those love at first sight deals.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  After many, many years of just total disappointment, so, it's like ... you know, I'm not really quish to rush -- quick to rush into the marriage thing just yet.
R:  Oh no, no.
L:  But um ... we're ... we're -- we're building it in that direction.
R:  Well, great, great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's a -- he's your -- your best male friend?
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  My best friend is a male too, so I just uh ... I know how you feel [LAUGH].
L:  Well, they say the person that you spend the rest of your life with is supposed to be your best friend but I really, honestly believe that -- that's all well and good, you should be able to tell them everything and not be afraid to, you know, hold anything back but I do believe when it comes to men, there are some things that they're just not interested in hearing about.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's where the best female friend comes in [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I've had -- I've had some female friends that, you know, uh ... back when I was in college, I had a female friend that, you know, I thought was my best friend and then ... it's just like, some of -- some of your friends that you consider best friends want -- they are just taking the friendship, they're not giving any back.
L:  Yeah, just take, take, take.
R:  Mhm.  I had -- I had a good friend that was that way and uh, now I've -- if I had been asked that question, I think, about the million dollars with -- with that particular person --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  -- I probably would have taken the million there [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Sure.
R:  That's -- that ugly to say but, you know, when it's that -- so one sided, um ... she had gone through a divorce and a -- it -- you know, it was a -- it was a bad divorce ...
L:  Oh.
R:  ... uh, her husband was a -- a physician and it -- it really was a bad situation.  He left her right around Christmas and, um ... I just kind of was there.  We went to the same aerobics class, you know, and uh ... I was kind of there and so she, you know, she needed someone to talk to and ... she would call me sometimes -- I was married at the time -- she would call me sometimes at two oclock in the morning and that wasn't good but, you know, I was always there for her and um ... got her through that and then my mom passed away which was --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- a -- a very, very bad ... I mean, I was very, very close to my mom and she wasn't there for me, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  So, it was um ... it was not a good situation there with a best friend, but you -- you know, you can have some friends that really are, I guess, they do not uh ... define the word "best" so ...
L:  My son has a female friend that he goes to school with.  He's sixteen, she's sixteen and he just got his first real serious girlfriend and she is -- ironically, had her -- just recently found her first serious boyfriend, so ... and her good friend, uh, female friend, is very ... hello?
R:  Are you there?
L:  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm here.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, her -- I'm sorry -- her um ... her good friend is very jealous that she's spending time with this boy now and likes to make her feel guilty and I explained to this young lady that, you know, for one, I said, "You know, she -- she may be your best friend now, but is she your childhood best friend?".  She goes, "Oh, no, I -- that was somebody else" so I said, "Right" --
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- and then when you go into college" I said, "You know, you may still hold a very good friendship with this person but you're gonna meet somebody new, with different interests, different -- you're gonna change and you might find a new best friend there and then, maybe if you get married, you know, you'll find your new best friend in your husband ..." I said, "... and when you have babies, you're gonna find a new best friend in the motherly department".  I said, "You're gonna have a lot of people that serve the categories in your life the best way possible and" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- " you know, it's -- it's -- it's sad that you don't have the support of your friend now when things are really going good in your life and you're in la la land but, you know, you need to kind of keep it together and reassure this best friend of yours that, you know, um, I still love you, you're still my friend and, you know, just let -- let it -- let's see what happens from there".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she was like, "Oh, I feel so much better" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, I just, like, I just told her, I said, "Now, that's coming from a woman with experience in life with friends.  I've lost a lot".
R:  [MN]
L:  I've cried over a few and I've been angry over several, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I think, ultimately, the ones -- the best -- the best friend category really pertains to the person that knows you the best.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's true, that's true.
L:  Did you get this um ... how did you get a hold of this particular Fisher project?
R:  Well, I'm -- I do the mon- -- I'm part of the money and shopping network.
L:  Oh, so you're a mystery shopper too?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] are you?
L:  So am I, yeah!
R:  [MN] That's how I got it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, it was on one of my emails and I -- I decided to -- to -- to enter and uh, that's where it came from.
L:  That's wild.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  How long have you been mystery shopping?
R:  Oh, just a few months.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you like it?
R:  Well, I -- I do, uh, I'm trying to get more ... more shops.  I can't um -- I haven't -- I've only had one shop, so ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  I wonder why.
R:  Well, I've applied but you see, a lot of [MN] -- I have surrounding states like Alabama --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and Louisiana but the -- the shops ... I -- I get a lot of emails but a lot of them are so far away, like, uh, like Montgomery, Alabama.  That's just too far to go for a shop that's only going to pay, like, twelve dollars or something like that.
L:  Sure.  Right.
R:  So, I guess I've been kind of selective.  I have gotten a lot of emails but I just --
L:  Have you signed up for any self assigned websites?
R:  Self assigned?
L:  That's where you go to the website and you click on the jobs that they show you.
R:  Like the um -- uh, like Sassy, where they have uh, a log, a -- a job board?
L:  Actually, Sassy is really not one of my greater recommendations.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Sassy ... the company Sassy is basically just a -- a way for different companies to utili- -- to get forms and -- and such to their, you know, and receive reports from their shoppers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But [MN] some Sassy sites do have job boards, but I'm talking about um there's like, a boatload of um ... websites out there that you apply to and log on to and they list the jobs in the state and city that you select.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  If you want to give me your email address --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'll be happy to send you a list of links that you can play with.
R:  Oh, great, yeah.  Lauren, that would be great.  I would appreciate that.
L:  What is it?
R:  Um, it's James Warner, J.A.M.E.S. W.A.R.N.E.R. three at AOL dot com.
L:  Okay.  I'm a AOL also, isn't that funny?
R:  That's ... I thought I heard it a little bit ...
