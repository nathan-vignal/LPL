L:  [inaudible] Hello.
R:  Hello -- Hi.
L:  Hi.  Who --  
R:  Who is this?
L:  My name is Kym.  Who's this?
R:  Ah, my name is Guni.
L:  Gini?
R:  Ah, Guni.
L:  Guni.
R:  Yes, you've got it.
L:  Okay, so -- 
R:  Have you -- have you partici- participated in anything like this before?
L:  Um, I actually did a previous call from this service about, um -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- warfare, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, will you -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- what would you go back in time to change if you could?
R:  Um, [LAUGH] let me think.  Um, what -- what would I change if I have -- are fortunate to go back.  The -- the -- do you mean, ah, in my life or in -- 
L:  In your life, right.
R:  -- in -- in my life.
L:  Like if -- is -- is there one thing in your life that you wish you co- if you went back in time that you could prevent or that you could, um -- 
R:  Um, one time -- I'm not talking [LAUGH] -- I got engaged when I was twenty one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I may change that one.
L:  Did you get married from that engagement?
R:  No, we broke up.
L:  So, you wish you wouldn't have gone through that experience at all?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
L:  Has it -- 
R:  -- I wish I would not.  Yeah ...
L:  Was it b- because you, um, 'cause it was painful for you or just because it was -- 
R:  Oh, [inaudible] -- 
L:  -- wasted time, or -- 
R:  -- it -- it does, ah, it was longer en- engagement and our -- our families knew each other and after we broke up, ah, there was, um, there was problem between families.  So -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because -- because of us, kind of, so that is why.
L:  I see.
R:  Yeah.  So, ah, are you a participant too or -- or you are -- 
L:  Yeah, I'm a participant too.
R:  Okay, b- about you in?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, that's a tough one too 'cause, um -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- personally if I had to say something, you know, I -- I've, you know, tried to live my life pretty morally so I didn't d- haven't -- haven't done a lot of, like, bad things, you know.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, so that's kind of tough.  But, I guess if I could go back and -- and change things I would, um, I might change my major, um --
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- in college.
R:  What -- what's your major?
L:  Um, well, I majored in finance and I minored in economics and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- although it didn't hurt me, I think I would have -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, I think I would have enjoyed being an English major and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- maybe taking that in a different direction.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I guess it's not really a bad thing, but I guess -- 
R:  Yeah, it's not.  You can change it anytime you want.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well that's true.  I -- I'm in [several inaudible words] instead of going -- 
R:  O- o-
L:  -- back -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and having to redo, um, ten -- you know, doing four more years -- 
R:  Ye- yeah, that's right.
L:  -- of college, you know, you just kind of get a little more of your -- your life back.  I wish I would have started saving money sooner too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You know?  Like things you learn when you're older, like -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you were -- would have only been wiser to, ah, start -- 
R:  Did it.
L:  -- a savings account, or start -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- saving for a car or start saving for a house and then you could have that so much quicker.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  But, you can do it, um, now too.  I mean, you can be -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- if price is right now for the future too.
L:  Right.  Well, you see that -- yeah, that's -- that's what I'm doing now is really, um -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- saving and -- and things like that.  Wh- where are you from?  Where are you originally from?
R:  Oh, originally I'm from Turkey.
L:  From Turkey?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  Do you -- 
R:  Do you -- do you -- 
L:  -- w- w- were you born and raised there?
R:  Yeah, I was born and raised there.  I came to United States, ah, three years ago.
L:  Just three years ago?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Wow.  What brought you here?
R:  Ah, I don't know.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Just decided, huh?
R:  -- life.  Life.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Life.
R:  No, I -- I did my master here.  So, I came here to get my master degree.
L:  Oh.  So do you plan on going back or do you like it here enough to -- you want to stay, or ...?
R:  I will stay for -- for the while and then, ah, after that I -- I will decide.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, [several inaudible words] with this, like what is the purpose of, ah, this, ah, phone conversation?  I'm -- 
L:  I have no idea.
R:  -- intrigued.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I am probably as much confused about the purpose of these calls as you are.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, seriously.  I -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- I -- I have no idea.  I -- I thought of that -- 
R:  None.  My -- I just wondered, like, ah, I haven't, ah, done it before so I thought somebody is going to call me up with some question.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they are -- they are doing some scientific, ah, researches.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, but, ah, I guess, like, bot- bot- peop- ah, people are sh- participants, ah -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- nobody is.  But, I guess they are, ah, recording this conversation and they will decide, ah, they will get something else out of it I guess.
L:  I guess, yeah.  I -- I don't know.
R:  And the first thing they will realise that people leave the subject and then talk about some other things, right?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you know, it's kind of funny because the first one I did was about bio-warfare and the guy I was talking to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- knew a lot about it -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he talked constantly.  I mean, he just --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he was telling me about articles he had read and, um, he -- he knew a lot about it and so he was -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- talking about it the entire time.
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  So, that part was -- was kind of interesting.  But, yeah, I guess it's more nature to talk about different things after you stop talking about time travel.  'Cause it did-
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it didn't have to be personal, the time travel.  'Cause then I could think, you know, you could go -- 
R:  Yeah, I can, um, I can talk about it, um, like, since I got my master in, ah, engineering.  I know about the dim- ah, dimension and the travelling on time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, lately, ah, the -- the guy, ah, I forgot his name, ah, he -- he is trying to prove that, ah, Einstein theory -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the light theory E equal M.C. square is not totally right.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So, yesterday I was reading and that article.  It was kind of interesting.
L:  I guess so.
R:  Be- be- because if he is right then the, ah, Einstein, ah, proved that if we, ah, move faster than, ah, light, then we can travel, ah, we can travel in -- in time dimension -- through dimension.  So, but if he proved that it -- it -- it -- he is wrong on that and, I guess they will come up with new ideas.
L:  Right.  Wow -- 
R:  Yeah.  [inaudible] 
L:  -- it just amazes me that people are smart enough to, um, even challenge [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- things, ah, from history, you know?
R:  Yeah, but, ah, everytime you have to challenge the [inaudible] one, otherwise we cannot [several inaudible words].
L:  That's true.
R:  Because -- because Einstein challenge, ah, Newton theories and he proved that, ah, Newton theories is, ah, you can apply Newton theories in, ah, in certain, ah, cert- certain situation not, ah, for, um, for everything.  So -- so he challenge Newton, now this guy challenge New- ah, Einstein.  In the future somebody will challenge this guy and -- 
L:  Right.  I guess that's -- 
R:  -- they took -- they took [several inaudible words], I guess.
L:  -- the -- the benefit of technology -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- to keep challenging the previous genius.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think you're probably pretty smart too.  An engineer -- you've got a masters in engineering -- 
R:  Yeah, I, ah -- 
L:  -- degree?
R:  -- yeah, I have master in mechanical engineering.
L:  Wow, so what do you do?
R:  Ah, I'm working for the -- ah, software company.  We -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, we develop software for engineering c- ah, industry.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, to do the calculations and to manage the projects.
L:  Wow.
R:  For the software company.  Well, what do you do?
L:  I work for a brokerage firm.  So, I work with the stock market.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Which -- which has been very bad.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Actually -- actually, today it was good -- 
R:  Is it?
L:  -- we had a -- like a -- like a three percent increase.  So, today -- 
R:  Wow. 
L:  -- was actually good.  But, with -- after the president's address, um, we're very curious to see what's going to happen in -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- tomorrow's market and -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and going forward, you know it's hard to -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- hard to tell.  But, it's an interesting field.  I mean it's -- 
R:  Yeah, it is.  Like, um, I don't know but too much think about it and I don't understand that much.  That's why I bought something, ah, last year and then, um, lost all the money -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that I put in.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What did you buy?
R:  [LAUGH] There was a -- a software company -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in, ah, Virginia.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- I bought, ah, their stock.-- 
L:  Well, you know -- 
R:  -- and they did- they didn't do good last year -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and then most of the software companies, they didn't do, ah -- 
L:  Yeah, it was -- 
R:  -- good.
L:  -- it was a tough time for a lot of stocks.  But, y- y- you know, you certainly weren't alone and -- and really, a -- a -- a lot of people, um, you know, they do, they pick a -- a -- a stock that's either something that --
