R:  Hi, my name's Allen. 
L:  My name is Nancy.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing great Nancy.  How are you?
L:  Uh-huh, I'm doing fine.
R:  Okay.  You want to go first?
L:  Um, I can try.
R:  Yeah, I'm stalling.  I'm trying to having to think about this a little bit.
L:  Okay -- 
R:  Why don't you go ahead?
L:  The question was if we could go back in time, what would we change?  Well, I think that, um, possibly I would change some of my living habits and, ah, some of the boyfriends that I -- I might have gone with -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [MN] some of the actions that maybe that I had taken.  What do you think?  What's your opinion on that?
R:  Well, I think in retrospect what I would have done, I think I would have, um -- I, ah, I left college to, ah, pursue a music career and what I should have done is -- I had two and a half years in and I was doing fine, and what I should have done was put off what I did for a year and a half, finished up my degree and then pursued what I did.  Because, finishing the deg- degree later on was really a difficult challenge.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I see what you're saying there.  Well, I know that I went ahead and finished school, you know, and I -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- always said, you know, that I would finish school.  But, ah, I -- I didn't have any thoughts of going to college because I didn't have the money to go, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But, ah, I'd, ah, I'd have probably studied harder in school while I was there because I think back to some of the times that, you know, I coulda used some of the stuff that maybe I didn't study hard enough on.
R:  Right. 
L:  How -- 
R:  -- Well, I -- 
L:  -- were you in school?
R:  What?
L:  How were -- 
R:  How was I?
L:  -- you in -- in high school?
R:  Well, I was really -- I was really good at school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but, um, I had a opportunity, um -- I was either -- see I had -- I had even skipped, ah, first grade 'cause I -- I was reading seventh[?] grade level in kindergarten.
L:  Hey, that sounds good -- 
R:  And it's a long -- long story how that happened but I was raised in a -- in a rural area and we didn't have anything to -- wasn't a whole lot of neighbors and so my older brother would come home and we'd play school, and he would just teach me what the teacher taught him.
L:  Right. [inaudible]
R:  And -- and, ah, what the deficit [inaudible] -- the -- the downside of that was is that by the time I went to school I was kind of a -- kind of an odd ball, you know -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so, they didn't really know exactly how to deal with it.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- but, I think, like I said, had, ah -- had I, ah, had the wisdom really to take good counsel I would have stuck it out for the other year and a half -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and finished up my -- my music degree at that time 'cause I was -- I was considering going to college for medicine but I ended up going for music instead and, um, I would have finished it up then and that would have made -- that -- that one decision would have made a lot of things, ah, simpler and better in my life.
L:  Right, right.  Well, ah, like I said, I didn't pursue college.  I didn't think, you know, that -- that I wanted to go.  But, I -- I did go later after I was married and -- and I should have studied harder in college but, you know, I -- I had other thin- I had a child and so I had to quit and take care -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- of my child, you know?  And, um, well, ah, money situation there too, but I wanted my husband, you know, to go on to college too.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, there was things, you know, you -- you -- you would say, "Well, okay you go ahead and do this" you know, because he already had a degree and he wanted to go and get his masters degree.  And I thought, well, that was more important than me going to school too.
R:  Well, sometimes we don't really consider, ah, you know, in a -- in an attempt to be kind and gracious, sometimes really what's important to us gets put to the side.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  That's true.  Uh-huh.  Um, and this -- the -- the time machine, you know, ah, when -- when it was first brought up I -- I -- I was thinking of the movie about a time machine that this guy goes back in time, you know, he gets in the machine and [MN] goes back in time and I was thinking, "Well, how can you do that?"  You know, you really can't go back in time.  You know, what you do back in the past, you know, it's -- it's past.  You -- you can't go back and -- and collect that and say, "Hey, I'm going to do it over".  If we could, you know, we might be going back in -- in time every time we turned around, and I don't think that, ah, God meant for us to do that, you know?  We're supposed to go forward and learn by our mistakes that we have done in the past.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I totally agree with that.  I totally agree with that.  But -- and the other thing is that the [inaudible] -- the -- the way that we were thinking at that time, if -- if -- if -- I know if I went back to when I was fifteen or sixteen, I would probably still make some of the -- some of the dumb choices -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that I made then -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and the reason why is, even knowing what I know now, if I went back then, I would still be thinking like a fifteen or sixteen or eighteen year old and all of a sudden those same things, it would make sense to me all over again.  I used[?] to[?] think, "Well, that's still probably the best choice I could make" you know?
L:  Well, yeah, yeah.  That- that's true too, you know.  A- you know, I don't know why people are always saying, "Well, if you could go back and change something, what would you change" you know.  Well, you -- you got to think that if -- if -- if you go back you're -- you're still thinking the same way, you know -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, you- you'd still make the same old dumb mistakes and say the same thing over again.  I mean, [LAUGH] we can't go back and undo it, you know?
R:  Well, I -- I -- I think that, you know, that -- um, sometimes when it looks like a mistake or a failure can actually, you know, work out to the good -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it -- it can actually have been for our good even really unfortunate situations at times, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, we learn -- 
R:  -- um -- 
L:  -- from our mistakes.
R:  Right.
L:  So, [MN] you know, I -- I -- I think that, ah, the mistakes that I had made I've -- I've learned from them and I've even, ah, tried to teach my children, you know, to l- to learn from my own mistakes.  But, I think -- 
R:  How successful -- 
L:  -- sometimes -- 
R:  -- has that been?
L:  The what?
R:  How successful has that been?
L:  Um, I don't think very -- very successful.
R:  Well, probably about as successful as, you know -- 
L:  As our parents -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- tried to teach us.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Absolutely -- 
L:  Yeah, you know, you -- you -- you tell them, but -- but they've got a mind of their own to be able to -- you know, they have a choice, you know --  
R:  Right.
L:  -- God gave us a choice and -- and they've got a choice.  So, you know, [MN] we just -- we just can't -- we can't live and -- and say for what our kids would do.  Because, you know, they're going to do -- they've got a mind of their own, like we had a mind of our own and we did exactly probably the opposite of what we were told not to do, and our kids have done the same thing.  It's just like history -- history repeats itself.  So, you know -- 
R:  I -- I -- I, yeah, I agree.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, the -- the -- the thing -- the thing that, ah, I think on my part that the only difference I- I've tried to make was to really maintain a better relationship with my children than probably my dad and my mom did.
L:  Right, yeah -- 
R:  Where -- where as at least, um, I have -- you know, I've tried to maintain a place where I at least have a platform to speak into their lives.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  To where, you know, um -- I was raised in a -- in a area -- I was raised by a real angry father and -- and, um, you know, it's real hard to hear his counsel, it's hard to hear his wisdom because -- 
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- ah, you know, his [inaudible] stuck out so much and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, just the character issues.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, um -- but, so -- so, my approaching that was that, you know, we make a lot of mistakes but to try to, you know, try to maintain the kind of relationship with my children where I can -- I talk to them.  My youngest son is eighteen now and he's high school senior and I taught at his school for five years.  I'm not teaching now but I have -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, and I've got a married daughter and I've got two older step kids and -- and they have had -- you know, I- I've been, you know, pretty successful and, ah, and -- and -- and I feel good about that -- that, ah, [inaudible] if I made as many mistakes as my dad did or my -- you know, just in general relationships are difficult but, ah, just to try to maintain a level where, you know, if I blow it where I just can humble myself to my kids -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and not -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and not have to be right all the time and so that there's a relationship there other than, you know, I'm bigger than you are and so my ways the only way that makes any sense.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  And -- and that was -- that was successful, I think.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I know that, ah, with -- with, ah, my kids that, ah, my husband was very lenient with them, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if he told them, "No" well, in a little while he'd go ahead and tell them, "Yes".  But, if I told them, "No" I meant no.  My kids knew that I meant no.  But, I could tell my kids that I loved them, you know, where my husband couldn't tell them that he loved them.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, my -- my parents, they never told me really how much they loved me, you know?  They might -- I don't think I ever heard my dad say that he loved me.  But, I -- my mom, I think, told me one or two times.
