L:  Hello, my name is Karen.
R:  Hi, my name is Candy.
L:  Hi Candy.  I'm calling from Washington state.
R:  Oh, I'm calling from Michigan.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, how cool.
R:  Oh, thanks.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We actually had sixteen degrees today so today is a good day.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's been not too bad for us either actually.
R:  Good.  Good, good, good.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- ah, this is the first time I've ever made any of these calls, do you know?
R:  Me too.  I was hoping you would guide me through it.
L:  Oh, Lord --
R:  We'll muddle together. 
L:  -- I don't know.  I -- I know they say you're supposed to talk on this particular subject -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for, like, ten minutes or something.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I guess w- -- if -- do you want to go ahead?  Wh- wh-
R:  Sure -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- now it's a hypothetical situation.
L:  Yes.
R:  And it's if we could change something what will we change.  Um, I think th- the thing that I would change most that I would be -- would have been more serious in college.  When I got to college I was just, like, so excited to be away from home I didn't know what to do.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, um --
L:  I know how that is.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I went -- I went to Michigan.  University of Michigan which is a real big party school.  I think there should have been a major for that but -- 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, I [LAUGH] I would have, um, you know, gotten more serious, like, in my freshman and sophomore year and -- and gotten a l- little bit more focused but I was like a really sheltered child anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't think it would have done any good --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I was just so excited to -- about being away form home.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I -- I think that's what I would concentrate on and -- and -- and change.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I can understand that myself actually.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  I think, though, that, a- -- you know, for me I think it would be, um, I don't know?  I -- I -- you know how they say, "Love is blind" right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, not that I've not been, ah, 'cause I've been married for quite a long time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I've got my kids my -- they're teenagers now and I wouldn't do, you know, take them -- give them away for anything in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I think I would, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- if given another chance to go back, and if I knew I'd have the kids I have now -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think I would have ha- waited for a different guy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Would ya?  Okay.
L:  Isn't that awful?  That's bad to say -- 
R:  No, not really.
L:  -- but it's true.  You know, my husband and I, I mean, we -- we -- I mean, we get along at times and at times it's really bad and then -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, like my mum will tell me, you know, a- a- a lot of wh- like what you were saying about college, she said that y- y- y- she thought I only got married to get out of the house.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  And -- and I don't know, you know?  At the time, oh I could say, "Oh you're nuts, you know, I --" 
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- no I -- that's not true" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but actually once you step back out of the situation, you know, [NOISE] it's very -- it's very possible.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] 
L:  You know, as much as you don't want to have to admit it -- 
R:  Right, and I agree with that too -- 
L:  -- and I think -- you know?
R:  -- because I'm -- I'm remarried and as soon as I got out of college and went back home and then I- I- then I magically met this guy at work and, like I said it -- it -- I was twenty five -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you would think I'd have my head together.  But, we were both young.  We were both only children --
L:  Yeah, oh my.
R:  -- we were both home so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, we were destined for failure.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But not -- 
L:  Yeah, I was young too.  I was twenty one and --
R:  Were you?  Okay, I see.
L:  -- and -- and he was [NOISE] -- you know, I didn't go out with hardly any -- I mean I never really had a steady boyfriend in highschool --
R:  Me too.  Me too.
L:  -- and th- and my mum even said, you know, "This is really the first guy that paid attention to you, that was the one that you" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, because I told her one time, you know, when I was younger, um, yeah before graduating highschool I said, you know, I -- I really don't want to be lonely --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the world, you know, after [NOISE] -- after I get out of c- [NOISE] [LAUGH].  My son's here listening to what I'm saying.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How old is he?
L:  After I, um, you know, after I got out of school, you know, I just didn't want to be lonely.
R:  Right.
L:  But, little do you know at that particular time that there's other forms of loneliness.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  -- you know, which is not good either -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, you know.
R:  You can be lonely in a crowd full of people, you know?
L:  Yeah.  But, I mean you never can a- a- I don't know.  You kinda wish that you could just take one day and just jump ahead -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, just to see what it would be like years from then.
R:  First evolve type of thing?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I know, I know.
L:  -- oh.  You know, I just wish one day, you know, you could just, like -- or even just to go back in my life for one day and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know.  I -- I don't know.  Just to get a better perspective about it, I guess, or something. 
R:  True, true, true.
L:  But, yeah.  I know what you mean.  I -- I don't know.  That m- might not be the good thing.  I mean, the rest of -- of what I've done in my life is good -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, my kids and everything, like I said, I- I've always b- I wanted all three of them.  [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I got -- I got t- well, I got two teenagers and one that just turned twenty, um, and one that's turned eighteen just last, er, actually in January.
R:  Uh-huh.  Great -- 
L:  And then my daughter's sixteen.  So, you know, they're up in age and, you know.
R:  You're almost emptying this time, huh?
L: Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's good for you.
L:  Yeah, just about.  Just about.
R:  Great.
L:  So, you know, I don't know.  I just, um, that's just mainly the one thing I think is -- and I think a lot of people well, you know, the ones that might not be so happy, you know, with the -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- marr- you know, if they're in a particular marriage if they're not really happy.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I- I -- like, there's people that I've talked to at work and stuff like that that have gone through divorces or, you know, or having difficulties and stuff and, I don't meet very many that say that they'd give their kids back.  [LAUGH]  You know what I mean?  It's -- I don't know it just, um, it's always the guy that can go, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm. Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  But, um, yeah I think that's probably what would -- what I would do.
R:  Right.  Well that -- that sounds -- sounds very -- I think we're both on, like, the same path.  But, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.  I think so to.
R:  -- and, ah, and --
L:  So -- so do -- have you recently got remarried?
R:  Ah, in two thousand, this'll be our third -- 
L:  Oh you did?  Oh that's pretty recent.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- so, yes it is.
L:  -- oh congratulations to ya.
R:  Yeah, it's really, really nice now and, like I said, we're all [MN] -- you grow up a little bit and, you know, things are a completely different respective now.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.
R:  More settled and everything.  So, it -- it feels real comfortable now, you now?
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah, it's go-
L:  Yeah, my mum lots of times will say, you know, and my friends, you know, that I now, you know -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- "Why don't you do something about him, you know?"  And I said, "I didn't -- I've known him for a long time" -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I had been married a long time.  It's not been the best but, I mean, a- a- a- I wouldn't get, you know -- 
R:  Change anything, right?  Yeah.
L:  -- chances are I'm not going to get anybody else, you know -- 
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  -- it's not like they're beating down on my door or anything like that.
R:  Exact- oh.
L:  And, you know how it is?  You just get so used to certain things and that's the way you so -- it's easy for you to keep in that --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- in that mode.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  So, I agree.  So, that -- I mean, that -- that's good.  I can't think of anything else that I would really change and everything worked out for the good anyway.  So, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  It's the same situation that you have but -- 
L:  I agree with ya.  I think that that, you know, is really -- is, um -- a lot of people -- I- I- I don't know Dawn.  You know, at least you've had a really lousy life or something --
R:  Right, right, exactly, and mine hasn't been -- 
L:  -- like that, most people have that kind of look, you know -- 
R:  Right, you know?
L:  -- outlook. 
R:  It's -- it would just be a tweak.  You know -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- not a life changing hundred and eighty degree turn or anything like that.  Just, you know, a little nudge here, a nudge there.
L:  Yeah.  Or -- or who knows, you know, like you said, maybe I -- you know, I would have been the same person.  But, maybe, you know, I would be able to get him to be a little bit different -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, behaviour wise and -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and -- and, you know, that kind of thing, who knows?
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I could go back and change, maybe I'd change him.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] We should all be given magic wands, you know?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh Lord yes, wouldn't that be great?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just a little tap there and everything and little sparkle dust, everything will be fine. 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think that that would be fantastic.
R:  I know, and now I feel like going to Disney World, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I do to.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Tinker Bell or what is it?  She's the one with the -- the magic wand or -- 
L:  Yes, yes.  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know, so I think that's -- that was -- that would be it.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  So, we'll see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well.
L:  I don't know, you know, I mean, are we supposed to -- I don't know if we're supposed to talk until they say not to talk -- 
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- or -- [LAUGH]
R:  Um -- 
L:  You know what I mean?  I'd --
R:  -- I honestly didn't look at th- the -- I know it was, like, eight thirty wasn't it?  I mean, well [NOISE] the thirty mark.  S- I'm -- 
L:  -- yes.
R:  -- ah, eastern time. 
L:  Yes.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, it's about [SIGH] well, yeah, here it's like five forty one, or --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- eight forty one I guess.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it's -- it's pretty b- I don't, I would imagine you wait until the robot person says --
R:  Oh, do you?  Okay.
L:  -- go on ahead and stop or something, I think.
R:  I had misplaced my password for -- 
L:  Say, I couldn't find mine right off the bat either.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, you know?
L:  He's going -- 
R:  And I had to email them back and forth.
L:  -- which is -- yeah.
R:  Yes.  How did you find out about it 'cause I -- I do mystery shopping and they actually -- 
L:  So do I!
R:  Oh, do you really?  Did you find it on one of the boards?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Did you find this -- the Fisher survey on one of the boards?
L:  Yes I did.
R:  That's how I found out too!
L:  M- matter of fact they said, "Go to that right now" --
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and so I did and it was like, gosh this is a pretty --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- easy way to -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know, to make extra money.
R:  At least you're not out timing someone and looking for -- I do this Taco Bell thing --
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  -- I'm doing it for six months and, um, it's thirty Taco Bell [inaudible] in a month, you know, and every -- I went tonight to pick up some fast food for my family and I felt so weird 'cause I wasn't timing the -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the time between the m- ah memo board and the -- the drive through.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I didn't have to look for anybody's name on their badge.  I just -- [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, I know and isn't that something?  I find --
