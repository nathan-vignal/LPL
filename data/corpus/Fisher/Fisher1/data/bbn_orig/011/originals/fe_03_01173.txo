R:  Hi.  [MN] Excuse me, how are you doing?
L:  Oh, I'm doing okay.  It's the first time for me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  First time for me as well.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Um, nah, I don't think so.
L:  What?
R:  Nah, th- the question was, um, would -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you, for -- 
L:  Would you not talk to -- 
R:  -- a million dollars stop speaking to your best friend?
L:  Yeah, that's what the question was.
R:  No.
L:  You wouldn't?  I -- 
R:  Nah uh.
L:  -- would.  I don't -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- have a best friend.  I don't have a best friend that's why.
R:  Okay -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I -- I wouldn't.  My -- my best friend [several inaudible words] a lot of years -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I've been friends -- best friends with the same person for, like, sixteen years -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  now and -- 
L:  Well, that's different.  That's like having a brother.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or a sister, whichever.  Yeah -- 
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's -- that's no lie -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- on that.  They -- they mean -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- too much.
L:  Well, even my brother's not my friend.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess it reflects on me.  I -- 
R:  Well, it's not -- 
L:  -- don't know.
R:  -- always, not always.  Sometimes -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- people, you know, can't receive good people.
L:  Yeah, I guess so.  Well, I got good friends when I was a teenager, and then when I met them again after about twenty years, thirty years after that, they were so different and -- and I wondered, "How could I have been their friends" you know?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Everybody changes.  But, maybe if you stay friends -- 
R:  If you grow with them, mhm.
L:  Yeah, if you -- yeah.  Maybe then -- then you don't see, you know?  Maybe -- I don't know.  I'm looking for a best friend now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  What -- w- w- do you do anything socially?
L:  Well, I just moved so it's -- it's difficult.  Um, I'm in a community where they -- they'll have a club house and they'll play cards and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a swimming pool and all that, but, they -- but, it's not here yet -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I'm still waiting for the summer for -- for all that.  So, I'm kind of cooped up in the house with [inaudible] doing a lot of my, um, things that I have to do like, um, put away boxes and, you know, organize everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm busy doing.  Yeah, what about you?
R:  Me, um, [inaudible] with school and a couple of bad things have happened to my family lately, so -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- this has been a time period where my best friend has been really beneficial for me, so -- 
L:  Oh, that's good.  That's [inaudible].
R:  I wouldn't -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I wouldn't trade em in.
L:  Uh-huh.  Where are you?  Wh- what state are you in?
R:  I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, really?  I'm -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in Florida.
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh.
R:  You can't find a best friend in Florida?
L:  [LAUGH] Why?  W- why should it be easier in Florida?
R:  I mean, it seems like there's a lot of people being active and everything.  I've been to -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Fort Lauderdale once -- 
L:  Yes, it's pretty active there.  But, I'm older, you're -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- young.  You're young, I'm older.
R:  That's even -- 
L:  Ah.
R:  -- more reason I would think and I think -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- once you get to older, people start to have a little more value, I guess, you know, you would think.
L:  You would think, yeah.  [LAUGH] They're just older, they're the same people -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- everyone's the same, only older.  That's all -- 
R:  I dig it.
L:  -- so, if you have a -- a good friend now, or keep your good friend, that- that's very good.  That's very good.  I don't blame you for your answer, but, um, I could s- I could just say that I -- I would give -- I would take the million dollars, 'cause then -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'd be able to give my four children parts of it, keep the little bits for myself, 'cause I wouldn't be giving up anything actually, see?
R:  I dig it.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well.  What can I tell you?  So, this is your first time doing this?
R:  Yes, this is my first time.
L:  Yes, it's my first time too.  Before they called me and I -- and I punched in the wrong code and then I went back on the internet to check my code and it was, like, two numbers different -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- so, that -- 
R:  -- I had to check mine as well.
L:  Yeah, well, they called me last night at eight o'clock when the president started to speak.  So, I didn't want to do it then either.  I wanted to hear what he had to say.  Right -- 
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- at eight o'clock the phone rang.
R:  -- this is -- this is a very exciting time.
L:  Yeah, it sure is.
R:  Very exciting time.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, what school are you in?
R:  I'm in community college of Philadelphia.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, you're in Philadelphia, all right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.  Stay in school.
R:  Oh, I am.
L:  Yeah.  It's important.  Very important -- 
R:  Yeah, I went back to school.  So, I definitely know it's important.  You know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whenever I -- out of high school they -- they don't understand yet -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you spend -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- a few years working -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- college has great meaning.
L:  Right -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- right, right.  You'll n- it'll never be a w- a- a- thing that you -- it'll -- it'll always help you no matter what -- 
R:  No matter what.
L:  -- even if you do something that you didn't really need to go to college, it still helps you somewhere, somehow.
R:  I agree.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Are they going to tell us when it's ten minutes?
R:  Yeah, they do.  They do follow the call.
L:  Oh, they do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's good.  I don't know, watching the stock market g- I don't know, it's not doing much today.
R:  Everybody's waiting to see what's going to go on in the world.
L:  Yeah, I know, I know.  Well, I heard somewhere that if Saddam Hussein says he's not leaving they might even go in before the forty eight hours.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  I heard that somewhere.
R:  -- that's what they're concerned with.  Um -- um -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- doing a preemptive strike -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um ...
L:  Oh.
R:  And d- United States knows he's not going to leave.  But, I can't necessarily say I blame him for that either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, if the shoe was on the other foot would Bush leave the White House?  So -- 
L:  Well, no, I don't think so.
R:  -- ah, yes, ah -- 
L:  -- I don't think so.
R:  -- I can't necessarily blame him for that.  Sometimes people need to be a little less political [inaudible], a little more human -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we can understand a lot more what's going on ... 
L:  Right, right.
R:  In this whole thing.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, if I take the million dollars I'll have to give you some of it?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No?
R:  W- we can go shopping.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right.  Well, I'll have to come to Philadelphia and see the snow then.
R:  Well -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'm trying to get down there to see some sandy beach.
L:  Yeah, right -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- and then they tell you that there's life in the water and then -- then there's, ah, bacteria in the water.  Don't go in the water.
R:  Mm.
L:  The wonderful looking water that -- that you shouldn't go in anyway.
R:  Yes, it's nice.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  It's nice.
L:  I know. 
R:  Whoever thought on the planet that seventy percent at least of all fresh water is frozen in the north and south pole.  We would -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- think that we can't drink water or have any water to drink.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That -- that makes no sense to me.
L:  No, not really.
R:  You -- you can dig -- you can dig oil from below the sand and below the ocean -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- run some pipelines and put some plants up there on them polar caps and melt down on our water we got sitting.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I don't know -- 
R:  But, we spend more --
L:  -- maybe they should just -- 
R:  -- money on death than life, you know, we -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- man kind of has this suicidal spirit.  I believe it.
L:  Think so?
R:  We spend far more on death than life.
L:  Oh.  So -- 
R:  Yeah, o- on things -- 
L:  -- what do you think -- what do you think of philosophy then?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Think of philosopher?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Actually, I am -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- just going to school to become a psychiatrist.  But, um -- 
L:  Oh, really, oh -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a psychiatrist.  Oh.  That's nice -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- are you going to go all the way -- become a doctor and become a psychiatrist?  Wow.
R:  I'm going to go all the way.
L:  Oh, boy.  So, how much have you done already?
R:  I've just started.  I'm just coming to the end of my second semester.
L:  Uh-huh.  All right -- 
R:  So, [inaudible] no, this it's pretty -- pretty cool.  But, I've been a -- ah, y- at the beginning [inaudible] a nursing assistant since high school -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my last position as a nursing assistant before I went back to school -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, was in the hospital.  It was on the psych ward and -- 
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- that had, like, you know, confirmed for me that -- 
L:  That that's what you want.
R:  -- that's what I want to do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I went back to school end -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- last year.
L:  Oh, that's good.  That's very interesting.  Very good.  Well, I went to college for two years and then I dropped out.  Then I went to work and I just worked in business, got married, had four children, lots of grandchildren.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, they're your friends and when you look at it that way, when you -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- look at family as friends.
L:  Well, that's not what they said though.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I -- yeah.
R:  Catch twenty two.
L:  No.  No, I don't -- I don't think -- no, it doesn't apply to me -- 
R:  I hear that.
L:  -- so, maybe I shouldn't -- maybe I shouldn't have done this kind of survey but I could talk about it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  In hypothetically speaking.
L:  Well, yeah.  Well, that's all there was anyway.  Right?
R:  There you go.
L:  I don't know.  Anyway, I think it's more than ten minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't you think so?
R:  I'm wondering.  I don't know.
L:  I don't really know what has to happen, if they get back on the line -- 
R:  [MN] I -- I would take -- yeah, I would think so.  I believe that's how he said it w- it goes -- 
L:  Well, I read on the internet that somebody was talking and they only talked about five, six minutes and -- and, um, they wanted to stop the conversation and the person, like -- like us t- we had to tell them that it's only six -- six, ah, minutes -- [several inaudible words] -- I mean, not ten minutes yet.  So, I don't know.  Maybe they don't know either.  Maybe they're busy doing something else.  Watching TV.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Listening.
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.  Yeah, well, maybe they're recording it and that's [several inaudible words] be doing -- 
R:  Yeah, I think they're supposed to record it and then review it later.
L:  Oh, boy.  Well, they have a New York and a Philadelphia person.
R:  See.
L:  An ex New York person.  I guess they'll know that when they hear it.
R:  How long have you lived down here?
L:  Oh, about ten years.
R:  Oh, that's not bad.
L:  No.  Not bad at all.  It's nice down here.  At least you get up in the morning, you put on a pair of shorts or something.  You don't have to look for snow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the weather's good.  Except that my kids are all over the place and I don't -- I don't see them.  I only have one down here and the rest are -- well, one's in Denver and they're having a snow storm right now.
R:  Mm.
L:  And one's in Connecticut and one's in Washington.  Virginia really.
R:  Yeah, that is scattered.
L:  Yeah, they are.  They really are.  What else can I say?  I never thought that would be my life, but, this is what it is.  Do you want to -- 
R:  So, when did they -- 
L:  -- analyze me?
R:  -- they all moved on --
