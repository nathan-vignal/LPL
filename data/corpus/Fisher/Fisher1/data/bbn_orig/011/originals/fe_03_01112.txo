L:  This is Mia.  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah.  I'm here.  This is Paula.
L:  Okay, Paula.  Um, you go first, because I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't know.  I'd probably further my education, I guess.
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm in my thirties.
L:  Oh, you got plenty of time for that if you still want to do that.
R:  Yeah.  Right now, though, I have three small children, so it's kind of hard with their schedule, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- once they -- yeah, once they get all in school then I will.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all -- yeah, well, yeah.  That -- that puts a damper on it.  I know when I was in college I had two small ones and let me tell you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was not easy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was fun and I was working two or three jobs at the same time.  Don't do it.
R:  That's what I've been --
L:  Don't do it.  Wait till they go to school and go ahead and do it.  Well, no, I shouldn't say don't do it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if you want to do part time, you could do like one class or something if you can stand to do one, then that's fine, or take a class online, that's fine, but you try to do -- with the full time, the kids and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- bringing -- it's too much, it's too much.
R:  Well, I've got one in school and then I've got one -- or I've got one starting school this year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then I've got a two year old, so, I'd like to find some classes online and -- and maybe get started and then by the time she's in kindergarten and I can, you know --
L:  Finish all the rest of your core classes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you would have to go to campus for, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I understand, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's the whole [inaudible].
R:  Unfortunate though that I have a husband that, you know, is working right now, so I stay at home with them, but --
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's awesome, that's the best thing in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the best thing in the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't get a chance to stay home when they were little and -- and I miss it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I tell you, I -- I'm going to tell you and -- and I did- -- I didn't get to stay home until they were older --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and by then they just didn't even care.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  But you miss it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You miss it and don't let nobody tell you, it's the hardest job in the world.
R:  Oh, believe me, I know.
L:  It is.  It's the hardest job in the world and you -- you are just amazing.  Trust me.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  You cannot -- no, people are crazy, I- -- it's hard and you stay and that's just, you're just a godsend, they don't even realize it, but they're going to be happy later on because --
R:  Well, I hope so.
L:  -- you'll -- they'll have one of those parents that they can say, "My mom went to everything".
R:  Yeah.
L:  My momma did everything, you know, whereas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, --
R:  But I --
L:  -- [inaudible] but my children can't say that, they can say well, "My momma was a work" [LAUGH].
R:  That's tough, huh.
L:  Yeah.  You know.  I didn't get to see --
R:  Well, you think you -- sometimes you think the grass is greener on the other side, I'm thinking, well, I sure could contribute more if I was at work, you know, but then --
L:  Yeah, but not to the -- everybody's lives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not to everybody's lives.  You don't need the Mercedes.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You don't need -- you don't need all that other stuff, as long as you got -- as long as the rent or the mortgage is paid and you got food --
R:  Right.
L:  -- pretty much, you know, whatever after that.
R:  Right.
L:  Everything else is just gravy because, trust me, it's hard on your marriage and it's hard on the children.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  And if the momma is not happy, nobody is happy.
R:  No [LAUGH] no.
L:  So, as long as you happy doing whatever, you know, at the house and dealing with them, then -- then that's all good.  It's all good.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, we were marry- --
L:  Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing I would change is to not have -- have to -- is to have stayed home.
R:  To stay at home?
L:  I guess that -- yeah, I would have changed that.  I think I would have stay- -- I know I would have done that.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because it would have been -- it would have been really g- -- I would have liked it a whole lot better.  I missed all -- I think, one day my, um, daughter introduced me to the Troop Leader of her girl scouts --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the woman had the nerve to introduce me to the other leader as the mother who is never present.
R:  Oh, my.  That wasn't good.  But you were --
L:  No.
R:  Well --
L:  A- -- and I -- it kind of hurt my feelings but she was right.
R:  Well.  Still, she --
L:  But it kind of hurt my feelings.
R:  -- shouldn't have said that.
L:  I know.  I wanted to smack her --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, how much --
R:  I don't blame you [LAUGH].
L:  -- you can't do stuff with your children and [inaudible] you just smile and go on and go mhm, hope I hope somebody will -- get a flat tire on the way home.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't know.  We were married seven years before we had kids, I got married at eighteen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you think, geeze, what did I miss, you know.  So ...
L:  Oh, you didn't miss anything.
R:  Yeah, well some --
L:  You didn't miss anything, that's great.
R:  The work world, you know.  Ah --
L:  No, you didn't miss a- -- girl, you have the rest of your life to work, my momma always said, you've got the rest of your life to work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't even worry about working, working where, whatever.
R:  Yeah.  That's true, huh.
L:  [inaudible] work and made all kinds of money here and there and this and that and the other and it don't amount to nothing if you ain't got nobody to share it with.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Nothing.
R:  So, did you -- you worked and went to college at the same time?
L:  Yeah, I worked two and three jobs, had little piddly jobs while I was --
R:  Who watched the kids?
L:  Um, my -- my parents watched the kids a little bit, ah, a- -- after they were in daycare during the day, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- afterwards they would, ah, go home and then once they got in school, they would --
R:  See, that's my problem, I feel like if I do go out and work, by the time what I'd get paid for three kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  It's not even worth it.  It's not -- and -- and you got to buy -- you got to find decent daycare --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you can't just send them anywhere.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, so, I mean, I had my parents were -- and they were working, but you know, they c- -- they were home at a decent hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that the kids could -- they could pick up the kids from the -- the --the -- the daycare --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then they went on a- -- you know, and did whatever in the evening while I was still either at my job or at a class or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Usually was one or two of them.  I -- I -- I tell you, for the first three years I don't think I hardly slept any, I -- I'd say I amazed me now I'm not on drugs.
R:  Right.  Well, what did you go to college for?
L:  I went to college for finance --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and chemistry.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I didn't end up doing that.
R:  That's what everybody says when they go to college they go for one thing and they don't end up --
L:  Yeah, I'm going to tell you what you do; you go to college for something you like to do.  If you're a writer, you like to write, you go to do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Don't go to do something practical that you ain't going to like.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Trust me.  Because you end up in a job that you just can't stand and then one day you just snap and tell folks if they don't get out your office --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're going to break their necks.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible] because you just going to snap, I mean, there was plenty of time -- I t- -- one day, I was in a -- in this one office, it was a big office with the cubicles, I pulled a desk and a chair, it was actually a table and a chair --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and hooked up the phone line, pulled it right on out the wall and put myself in the closet because those folks was plucking my nerves --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yacking me to death about stuff I don't care who you screwing this week, it does not make a difference, because you're not paying no rent at my house, I don't care.
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] you know, it -- they was just plucking my nerves.  I couldn't take it.
R:  Yeah.  That's a bad thing, too, about being in the work world you've got to put up with all that stuff, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you know, like I said, sometimes I think --
L:  But I mean, then again you still around adults all day, of course, half the time you're around crazy folks.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean, but find out what you like to do, whatever you like to do, because if I had a chance, b- -- if I could do it over, I would go to college for art, I like doing art --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I like doing all kinds of art, art things and I would go for that.
R:  Right.
L:  I wouldn't go for something, I -- I -- it wouldn't be, because it really doesn't make a difference because it doesn't matter what you get your degree in anyway, you're going to end up working somewhere, whatever.  I w- -- I was an engineer --
R:  Well, do you think that --
L:  -- and I ended up working with people that had english degrees and history --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- degrees, it didn't matter.
R:  Right.  So, do you think though --
L:  We were all engineers.
R:  -- it made a difference in your pay, though, for going to college?
L:  Oh, no, yes, yes, yes, it made a huge difference in my pay.
R:  Right.
L:  But it didn't matter what I did, it just mattered that I had a degree.
R:  Right.
L:  Do you understand what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like that.  So, you just get your degree in something you like.  You like basket weaving, you just weave yourself some baskets.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] that's true, because if you don't like your job, what's the point, huh?
L:  Right.  Exactly.  I mean, because whenever you -- because when you go into college y- -- I mean, it's such a good time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're having.  I mean, it is -- it is an awesome time.  You have a good time, you meet good folks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things, people are just great.
R:  What age did you go?
L:  Then you can -- w- -- when -- when did I go?
R:  What age?
L:  Oh, what age?  I went when I was twenty one.
R:  You did.
L:  And I was two years older than everybody else.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, it --
R:  Boy, and can you imagine me going --
L:  -- didn't matter, it was still one big party.
R:  Can you imagine me going?
L:  It doesn't matter, it was still one big party.  Yeah, you can go.  You'd just become -- you'd be partying it up even more.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You going to be legal.  I mean, it was just one big party.  Didn't matter.  We had all kinds of folk.
R:  Yeah.  Well, in my thirties --
L:  Everywhere and things --
R:  -- I don't know, that's scary too, going back to college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with all the young ones.
L:  That ain't got nothing to do with it because they -- you got an edge on them, you know how to go to the library --
R:  Right.
L:  -- most of these young folks, they think the internet has everything, but you can't trust the internet for all your information --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you have to actually go physically and look it up.  Plus, you already know, being older, to -- don't let your pride get in the way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you are getting ready to make a C or fail a class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know you need to get your butt in that professor's office and start sucking up and asking for extra help.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, whereas, [several inaudible words] flunk out, they don't care.  You don't have time to be wasting money like that.
R:  No.  Sure don't.
L:  See what I'm saying?  That's what -- and that's what made a big difference.  I went a few years where I didn't have time or money to be wasting like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I went ahead and, you know, whatever they were doing and they -- the professors, if you're nice to them, you talk to them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they will make sure you pass their class.
R:  Right.
L:  Because --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- they know who's working and who's not.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that good advice.  So, maybe I can find something on
