L:  Hi, my name is Sylvia.
R:  Hi, my name's Lynn.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  You too.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  All right.  So, now what, do we start the discussion?
R:  Yeah, I guess so.
L:  Okay.  I- -- is this your first one?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Okay.  Mine too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Okay.  Now, I know they said something about if we could open up our own business, hypothetically --
R:  Right.  What -- what would you do and do you think you would be successful?
L:  Yeah.  Well, for me, I'd probably open up -- I want to open up a restaurant business --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, I want to open up a restaurant business, but then I want to open up a childcare centre.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  But then I also know with things being the way they are, so much molestation and stuff in the world, it's hard for people to trust you with their children.  You know, because they really don't know.  So, a restaurant business seemed like it would be a lot more beneficial because I just cook, you know, and if -- you know, I'd get -- if I get the information out to enough people, you know, people that know that I know how to cook --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they'll come in, you know.  And my -- my business will be okay.
R:  Right.
L:  And what about you?
R:  I think if I was to do my own business, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I've thought of a restaurant, too, like a pie and coffee shop --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, but I think I would lean more towards, um, I'd like to have an art gallery --
L:  [NOISE] Art gallery.
R:  Mhm.  And I would just locate local artists and, um, fill it up, I would give a lot of, um, exhibits and shows --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I would like people, the artists to teach there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, attached to it I would like to have a kind of a funky coffee house kind of thing next to it --
L:  Yeah [NOISE].
R:  -- and, ah, I -- I think I'd be successful in that because I would get pretty excited about doing it.
L:  Yeah.  That's something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, yeah, because, like, if I were to, you know, if I were able to open up a restaurant, I would want something that's different than what you just normally see, you know, I'd probably want a restaurant that served all different kind of foods --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- probably have a catering truck to go with it, but then I'd also like to have something different, like an area where the children can be children, you know, like you go out to some restaurants, kids got to sit there, you know, in highchairs and they can't move around and parents try to enjoy their meals and they can't because the kids are right there.
R:  Oh, right, driving them nuts [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  But you have like a little area where the kids could sit with like how they would do at school when they eat lunch together, you know, you have children that come in --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and they could sit together, a little group, you know, the parents could see them through a glass thing where they could see where their kids are sitting at, the kids have their own little waiters --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  You know.
R:  -- that'd be fun.  Yeah, they could get those little wrist bands like when they go to the grocery store --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stay at the little play thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know you've checked your kid in and they can't leave without you [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, because, you know, for like me being a single mom and I have a two and a half year old, it's hard for me to go out to a nice restaurant because unless I have a babysitter I'm trying to feed him, trying to eat, food's landing on the floor --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on the table, you know, so it's inconvenient, but if I could find a place where I could just check him in, you know, and then like I could see him through the glass while I'm eating my meal --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I could still see him, I would, you know, I would come to that business twenty four seven.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Because it would give me a break from him but yet I'm still seeing him.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know.  So what --
R:  Oh, I know what you mean.
L:  Yeah.  What else do they want to know?
R:  Um, how you would go about setting it up, did they ask that, I think?
L:  Yeah.  You know what, I really don't know, I know there's a lot of places people have told me that there are p- -- places where you can get loans from, um, that they have places where if this is something that's going to benefit the community --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can get these non-profit loans, but then for a restaurant, that's for profit because it's your own business.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  But, I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where I would really get the investors, I really wouldn't know because the type of business I would want to open up don't -- it doesn't qualify for non-profit [NOISE].
R:  Right.  So, you would probably have to just get a regular small business loan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then my credit being the way it is, that's a far fetched dream.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, because there's a lot of competition out there and the going rates that they have, it's [MN] it's out of my league.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's way out of my league because I'm living on a fixed income right now because I'm retired, so I mean that like barely covers my bills, I'm trying to raise a two year old, so I mean --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's -- it's just a dream.
R:  [MN] Right.  Right.
L:  You know.  And then for you, do you know any resources, or how would you go about it?
R:  How would I go -- I would probably try to start off maybe doing a co-op, um, and doing -- getting the grants, you know, doing the community thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with artists and -- and try to start from -- from there.  Um, but I know, you know, now I've just been visiting some art galleries this week and they said it's just so slow it's just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pathetic because that's, you know, it's a luxury and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- now with everything that's going on and particularly this next week, people aren't [LAUGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- cruising into art galleries.
L:  No.  They're not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  The best investment we could probably make right now would be a grocery store or hardware, um, a surplus store.
R:  Right.
L:  Because that's where the money is at right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because things coming up, you know, and everyone's on pins and needles.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know.  So, it makes it very, very hard.  But, yeah, that's -- they'd also be good places because you like also like for a restaurant in a community, a lot of t- -- a lot of times I know people start out by putting out flyers in the neighborhood, holding a meeting to let people know that, um, these people are thinking about opening up a business --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in their community and how do they feel about it, invite them to come out get their input on it, you know and the meanwhile it's about looking for the money.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, to be able to get investors that are willing to invest in it, they're going to have be in an area where it's going to bring in money.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know.  Because who would want to build a business up and then turn around a year or two years, investors are like, well it's not bringing in enough money, I want out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and then your business folds.
R:  Right.  Well, you know, if you could get your -- if you could somehow live in a place where you could have that approved kitchen by the Department of Health --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, a second kitchen -- it doesn't have to be anything great -- but they'll send you their guidelines and you could start out really small catering from where you live --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  -- um, I -- I did look into that once and we thought of, you know, turning the garage into this, you know, ah, approved kitchen -- it has to have like a sink with three sinks in it and I -- it needs to have different things, um, and I know people have started, ah, small catering businesses that way and then when they've made enough money, they've opened up a little shop --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  But, ah, yeah, it's, ah, there's a couple of different ways but then, you know, you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you've got to move your living situation around -- do you live in a -- a house or an apartment or --
L:  Right now, I'm just renting.  I'm in a house, but I'm renting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when you said that, I [MN] like I have a little shed that I have supplies in, you know, my excess stuff, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I wouldn't even have a place to even think about building and put a third sink, which would mean I'd have to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- find something like a storefront.
R:  Right.  Or like --
L:  You know.
R:  -- some place where there's a mother in law apartment that they're not using it in the basement --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so there's like -- yeah, hm.
L:  And see, here in LA, you don't find places with basements very often.
R:  Where -- where are -- where are you from?
L:  I'm in L -- I'm in Los Angeles.  Where you at?
R:  Oh, are you.  Oh, okay.  I'm in Seattle but I used to live in LA.
L:  Oh.  Okay. 
R:  Yeah, they don't have basements there [LAUGH].
L:  No, not over here in LA where I'm at.  Not [inaudible] Hollywood Hills --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- North Hollywood, I know they still have a lot of places that have basements to them, but [inaudible] where I'm at, a basement, oh, no, they wouldn't even think about having it.
R:  Right.
L:  With the crime rate the way it is, you have very few houses that have attics --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that you can live in anymore because of the crime rate.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So.  So, did we cover all their information?
R:  I think we did.  Are we supposed to talk for ten -- a full ten minutes [LAUGH]?
L:  With -- yeah, we're supposed to talk for a full ten minutes.
R:  Okay.  Let's see.  I think we've got probably a few more minutes [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  You know.  But, yeah, you know, it's like, but this is my first call that they've ever connected me --
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  -- where I had to talk with someone because like they had a topic on war, I'm like, ooh, goodie, find somebody --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- couldn't find nobody --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and they had one they called me last night, ah, either Friday or comedy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm like, okay, find someone --
R:  And they couldn't find anybody --
L:  No one's there. --
R:  -- could they?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  That same thing happened to me.
L:  Yeah.  And I was sitting on the phone, they like, well, you know, thirty seconds, if you want to wait for thirty seconds, I'm like, yeah, I'll wait.  You know, because it feels good discussing things with people from other areas, getting their input, their ideas --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- because things you've told me can help me.
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  You know.  So, maybe it's not such a far fetched dream, you know, catering from my house.  My mom used to do that years back.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  That was during the days when you could cook from your home, you could sell tickets and you fixed the meals and people come and buy it.
R:  Oh.
L:  But nowadays they have such strict guidelines, a lady I know took apart her garage and turned it into like a little place where she would serve food, fries and nachos for the kids --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and they closed her down.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But it was the neighborhood kids that was coming, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's like them eating at her house.  But because she accepted money --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was considered a business.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  Then taxes ca- -- you know, IRS came after her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they found out she was doing this.  How much money have you made?  She said, well I only get back the money like what I invest in the food.  She was lucky she got away, but I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- everyone's not so lucky.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  Yeah.  Sometimes when they bust you for that you can never open another
