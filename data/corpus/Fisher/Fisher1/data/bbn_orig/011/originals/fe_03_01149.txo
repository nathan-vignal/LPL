L:  Hello, my name is Robert.
R:  Hi Robert.  My name is Donna.
L:  Hey Donna.
R:  Hi, how are you doing?
L:  Fine, and you?
R:  Good.  Well, I guess our topic is about going back in time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, what we would change.  I guess that would be thinking about a situation that we might have done something now that we regret.
L:  Yeah.  Ladies first.
R:  Pardon?
L:  I said, "Ladies first".
R:  Oh [LAUGH].  Well thanks.  [LAUGH] Okay, well let me think.  The first thing that comes to my mind is -- gosh, back, um, when I was about nineteen years old, um, I was offered a scholarship and, um, you know like, ah, I guess a work, ah, a work study plan out of college up north in Wyoming.  I grew up in the mid west.
L:  Okay.
R:  And as -- when I was a kid my biggest dream was to be a forest ranger and I applied for a scholarship and I got it but my parents were just totally against it.  My mom especially.  I was really close to my mom and I was the last child at home and she didn't want me to leave and go out of state.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I just wanted to do this so bad and it was a really difficult, you know, and being as close as I was to my mom, to be assertive enough to say, "I'm going".
L:  Right.
R:  And I waited to the last minute where I knew, you know, if I didn't go now I was going to lose it.  And I packed everything up.  My -- my mom was in tears and I had a boyfriend at the time too.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  He didn't want me to go and, ah, I packed everything up and headed up there and my  mom said, "Well, you know, wherever you get tonight driving" 'cause there was a pretty -- couple of days drive, ah, "Give me a call.  Let me know you're okay and everything's going, ah, all right on the road".  And I'd never taken off on a road trip before.  I'd never gone anywhere on my own actually.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so when I called her she was just upset and, "I can't believe you're going to go off to college somewhere far away".  And then my boyfriend was over there at the house and it's like, "I can't believe you'd leave me and go away to a college" and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and the further I drove the -- the less confident I became.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, I got -- I got, oh, probably maybe five or six hours away from the college and I turned around and came back home.
L:  What!
R:  Yeah.  And I just kinda let it all go.  And I -- and I never married the guy either, you know.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And -- and then, about two year's later my -- my dad got transferred to another state and my parents up and left me!  [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess that's one of those things, you know?  I always thought, "If I would have just kept driving and just been strong enough to go for it --"  
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- what might have happened" you know? 
L:  Yeah, that would have been totally different for you.
R:  Yeah.  I think so.  But, then again, you know, I look at what happened because I didn't do it and, you know, I mean I guess it was meant to be.  You know?
L:  Yes.
R:  Still, it's one of those things I always wondered what -- how m- how different my life would have been.
L:  Right.
R:  If I would have gone ahead and followed my dreams.  So, how about you?
L:  Well, I guess you can say that, ah, one thing that I do regret about no doing what I want to do -- I had a girlfriend and we was like highschool girlfriend and boyfriend but we went to different schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And upon graduating she want me [COUGH] excuse me -- she want me to get married and go into the service -- or go into --
R:  She wanted you to get married in --
L:  -- yes.  Yes she wanted -- she wanted us to get married -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and go into the service.
R:  Both of you all go into the service?
L:  Right.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it sounded good but my heart just wasn't in it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean I would have married her but the part about went into the service -- and so [several inaudible words] we didn't and we eventually stopped seeing each other but we remained friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, my point is I knew that if I had've went into service that I know life would have been, ah, excuse my French, but a -- been a hell of a lot different for me now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, later on in life that she ended up being a -- an Atlanta police officer.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Yeah.  And I went on to chef school.
R:  Oh, did ya?
L:  Yeah.  And we went our separate ways and, ah, she ended up getting married, having the kids by another man.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I thought the first kid that she'd ever have be -- be by me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  You know how it is when you're in highschool, your first love.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, one of my first loves anyway.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And, ah, I -- I was born in Wanton, Georgia, but I was raised up here in Atlant- in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  I'd -- I'd figured you were from the south.  I could hear that accent there.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What -- where do you live now?
R:  I live in Idaho.
L:  I'm talking to you and you're almost in Idaho?
R:  Yeah, I'm in Idaho.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah, well, you know why I'm in Atlanta?
R:  Pardon?
L:  I said, "I'm in Atlanta".
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, anyway, do you run into her ever since you're still in Georgia?
L:  Ah [LAUGH].  The strangest thing, it's been -- I guess you'd say about five years ago I was going out to a [several inaudible words] to, ah, see -- to see a friend of mine.  He was, ah, on his dying bed.  He had aids -- 
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and I was getting off to [inaudible] a train[?].  And as I was walking at the train station I noticed this lady writing parking tickets.  I would never have dreamed it was her.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah, and I looked around and there was her and, you know, we talked [several inaudible words] and I just -- just [inaudible] another, and one thing led to another and led to another just like old times.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I can't even get into the general details.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, it was fun seeing her again and she still brings that same incident up that -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- if we had've got married and went into the service and how things would have been for us.
R:  Mhm.  So, it sounds like she still has some regrets too then.
L:  Yes, but, you know, she's pretty successful, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- plus I think after she left the police force that she wanted to be a lawyer. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And back during that time we both lost somebody in our lives.  She lost her sister -- he baby sister, and I lost my baby sister.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  They was both murdered.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, anyway, I won't get into all of that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you know, ah, if I see her like today, and she was divorced, I think that we would probably reunite.
R:  Do you think so?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how long has this been?  Quite awhile?
L:  Wow.  We're talking years now.  Ten, fifteen, maybe twenty years.
R:  Oh, a long time, huh.  Gosh.
L:  If I'm not being so blunt, how old are you?
R:  I'm forty six.
L:  Forty six?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, I'm forty one.
R:  Oh.  So, I think she would be about forty.  I think she would be forty now.
L:  Mhm.  Oh.  Well, I don't know.  That's pretty neat that you ran into her though.  I mean, it's almost like it was fate that you still had some unfinished business and you needed to see each other again.
R:  Yeah.  Are you married now?
L:  Uh-huh, I am.
R:  But, you didn't marry that guy who was -- 
L:  No -- 
R:  -- that guy right?
L:  -- no.  You know, I think just the fact that something deep inside of me felt like he was a big part of holding me from being what I wanted to be.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When we were dating he -- he says like, "Oh yeah, it sounds like a great dream".  But, then we it came down to me getting that scholarship and going then it was like, "No, you can't do that".  And, ah, I don't know.  I think just a little resentment there -- just that the relationship fell apart.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I -- I ended up going back to the boyfriend I had in highschool.
R:  Really?
L:  And we got married and had a child and everything.  So, if I wouldn't have broken up with him I probably would have married him -- never would have gone back to the old boyfriend and married him and had my daughter.  So, in a way, you know, part of me regrets that I didn't fulfill the dream but then another part -- I wouldn't have the -- have had my daughter.  So, you know, I -- I think things -- some things are meant to be.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand.  Ah, another thing that, ah, back in the past.  I could've had my own business.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, my own catering service.  But, the thing about it -- you know, it's never the same when somebody else is fronting it for you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like my oldest brother, you know, he -- he told me if I wanted a catering school.  I say, "Here, I want the chef's school" excuse my French.  But, anyway, make a long story short, I -- I turned it down.  I turned it down 'cause I couldn't run it the way I wanted to.
L:  Oh.
