L:  Hi, my name is Tolin Gaskins[?]
R:  Hi, I'm Alison Tosibados[?]  Um, I would not take the money because my best -- best friend's very important to me and it would not be worth it.
L:  Um, I would not take the money because um, I feel the same way as you do.  People are more important than things, than money, than prestige and um ... after all, we get [MN] we actually um become successful in life by the people that influence our lives so I would not take the money either.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah um, it's like, more important to, like, be able to make your own money and make your own success in- instead of just having it handed to you and -- if you are, you know, value people it would be [several inaudible words] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to have the money handed to you.
L:  I've never -- I've never -- never met a person that was just successful by money alone.  I think that um -- I think that a person is successful by treating others kindly and with love and um, giving attention to um other situations and trying to help um ... I know people that have had lots of money um in their lifetime and they're not any better than anybody else that I've met, um ... in fact, I've found that some people with lots of money have um ... are -- are worse off [LAUGH] than those that don't have any at all. 
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  But um ... no.  I've -- I've often thought about that -- that question, you know?  If I was given a lot of money, what would I do with it and um, that's one thing I definitely wouldn't do.  In fact, I've often thought, if I had money, I would -- I would give it to others to try to help others and um, definitely, if you get a million dollars and you take a million dollars just to turn -- turn your best way- -- uh, best friend away from you [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um [LAUGH] um, it's ... it definitely wouldn't be helping at all.
R:  That's true.  Yeah, like, um ... my best friends, like, some of them don't even, you know, don't have that much money but they're like, they'll give you, you know, any- anything you need, you know?  Anything that they can do, they'll do it to help you and, like, sometimes people with more money are kind of, like, more stingy with their money and they just, like, I don't know, I guess people without it value, you know, others more.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's more important.
L:  You know, that's what I've noticed too.  I've noticed, like, some people that have a lot -- lots of things and really haven't had to struggle and they have nice homes and really, really expensive vehicles and everything is just perfect, it seems like they lose touch with other people's feelings and just knowing how to be, like, down to earth with others around them, um ... and I feel the same way you do, um ... I've met people that basically had nothing um ... I lived overseas for probably about a year.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And some of the most caring, loving people that I met um in this third world country that I was living in, in the Phillipines, had very, very little and I've also heard very tragic stories of people with a lot of money that um ... that use their money to do harmful things to, like, young children and things and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like that.  Not to say that somebody with a million dollars would do that but I think it just goes to show, like, the aspect of what the average person or most people would um, allow their circumstances to lead or guide them um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, a million --
R:  I think, if you ... if you, like, earned your million dollars too, that would be different than if you just, you know, received it because you w- -- you wouldn't -- you know, you value things more when you actually have to work for them and ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... just to, like, get a million dollars that -- you know, for doing -- especially for doing a thing like not speaking to your best friend, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's ... I don't think a nice person would actually do that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Yeah um ... I often wonder sometimes about um some of these reality shows [LAUGH] even, you know, what extent will people go?
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Just to win money or gain a spot on um, national television?
R:  [LAUGH] Really.
L:  And it's like, you know, some people will degrade themselves just to go that far, just to get some type of notoriety or prestige or publicity or population[?] or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ... yeah ... um ...
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um ... let's see, what else?  Um ... well ... I guess a million dollars ...  oh, okay.  Like, I value my best friend probably more than a million dollars just because of, you know, every time that I've needed something, it's not really -- like, I don't really always need money.  I, you know, mostly need someone to talk to or someone like that and if I could just ... like, if I had to just give that up, it really wouldn't be worth it because, you know, it's like love is more, you know, valuable than money is.
L:  Right and in the end, if you have all this money and you don't have your friends or your family to surround you and love you, um, what have you really gained?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You've just gained something material and you can't take the money with you, um, you can't take a million dollars with you but you can take friendships with you wherever you go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um and I personally, I -- I value um ... I believe in, you know, an afterlife um ...
R:  Right.
L:  ... and I believe that, you know, the relationships that we establish now will be carried over in an afterlife, so with that in mind, um ... you know, if we need that person in heaven [LAUGH] you know, years from now --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  --  or whenever, you know?  I think that we'll look back on the times that we had here on earth and we'll think to ourselves, well, you know, "I'm really sorry for the way I treated you and I'm really sorry that I didn't do this and didn't do that".  I would -- I would rather um, live with no regrets as much as possible than to have money and a million dollars.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And granted too, I mean, that can go tomorrow.  If I knew exactly where to spend that million dollars ...
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A million isn't that much in today's world.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  I mean, a person over their lifetime will make more than a willion -- oh, more than a million dollars but [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  You know, they just won't make it at one time and ...
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Um ... yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  To me ... mhm?
R:  You go ahead.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... well, I guess it's back to, you know, what I -- what I was thinking about ... I've known some of the most kindest, nicest people that had almost nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And uh, that really teaches you a lot um ... and it shows you that money is not everything.  Like, when I went to this third world country, of course I never left the US before and I was thinking to myself, "Oh, man, I'm so glad to, you know, get out of the US" and everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and experience something new and I saw a lot of poverty around me but one thing I saw too was that these people loved their families.
R:  Right.
L:  And even though they had little, they were w- with their families every night, the husbands provided for the wives, the wives worked just as hard as the husbands, um, the children were always smiling for the most part and uh ... that -- that just says a lot [COUGH] and I think too, in their mind, they would never trade anything for that.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Like, some of these people, you know, they work really hard and sure, they could have gone to the city and gotten themselves, you know, high paying jobs and uh, gotten an education, gotten degrees and really, really tried to work hard but then, what would they have had?
R:  Right.
L:  They would have had less time with their families.
R:  Right.  I -- I see how that is and it's -- it's interesting because, you know, I really like -- I really want to work hard so that I can make a lot of money and everything but, like, the situation you're given, it's just -- it's kind of like saying that um, you know, money is everything and, like, I realise that, you know, I'm working hard, I want, you know, to make a lot of money but wh- -- like, I want to bring my, you know, family with me.  I want to be able to share that with them and, you know, my friends and everything and be able to, you know, give back to the community and, you know, be a good person but, you know, be -- you know, be wealthy and be able to have, you know, different uh ... different things, whatever I want, you know, a nice house, a nice car, et cetera, so ... yeah, I see how it's -- money isn't everything but I also think it is, you know, important and everything to ...uh ... to have.  Like, I would not like to live in a third world country [LAUGH] because of that lack of everything, even if it is more family oriented.
L:  I think you brought up a good point, too, that um ... you know, people will appreciate things more if they work for it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And um ... it's like, if you -- if you just -- if you're just given a million dollars, you'll be ... I think the average person, not everybody but the average person would be more apt to just go out and spend it.
R:  Right.
L:  And um ... and just do things that they shouldn't do with it.
R:  Yeah.  Yes.
L:  But if you know that it took you ten years or five years or however long and you worked really, really hard ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... and you had the support of your family and friends too behind you, while you made that money ...
