L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  [LAUGH] 
L:  My name is Linda.
R:  My name is Christie.
L:  This is kind of weird, huh?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It is.  I'd totally forgotten I signed up for this.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's been a while.  My daughter had done one but, ah, um, I haven't yet.  This is the first one.  So, we're supposed to talk for ten minutes or so while they record our voices about whatever that topic was.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, the topic was if we could go back in time, what would we change?
L:  Ooh.
R:  Do you want to start or do you, ah [LAUGH] don't want to start?
L:  Ah, if you have a thought go ahead 'cause I don't -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- have a specific thing in mind.
R:  Yeah, I definitely do.  Ah, the one thing --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- the one regret I have in life is that, um, that I -- I worked really, really hard to get myself through, um, to -- to a point, um -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that I could go to college --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I had dropped -- I -- I was a highschool dropout and homeless and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, faced all sorts of challenges in my youth and, um, and I worked really hard to get back to college and did really well, ah, for the first couple of years and then, ah, in the last two, when I transferred to a four year university, um, I graduated but I didn't really give it my all.
L:  Ooh.
R:  And so, I -- I really -- I -- I have really regretted since then that I didn't, um, take more opportunities that came up for me and get more involved in my academics.  And so -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, so that's always been kind of a regret for me.  Or, ah, if I could go back and do it over I'd do it differently.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, what is -- not so much a regret is, I've always wished that I had a second life almost because I'm fifty plus.  I have five kids.  I've got a great professional job and whatever, but ever since I was little I wanted to be a pediatrician.
R:  Oh.
L:  And by the time I was in the end of highschool I still wanted to be a pediatrician and I'd won a bunch of awards and whatever, went on to college and, um, about the second year in college I kind've looked around and went, "Oh, if I wanted to be a mum of a large family, which I did --" 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- and a pediatrician, this isn't going to work".  [LAUGH] So, you know, I mean you can't do both of them.  They take lots and lots of time.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, I ultimately --
R:  So, you made the choice?  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I did, so I have five children and -- which was great and I've been a pediatric physical therapist for years, but -- 
R:  Oh, that's pretty darn close.
L:  -- it is close but in the back of my mind, if I had another life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I always -- I still would like to do that, you know.  It'll never happen but it's one of those -- gosh --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- it would've been set.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, so you wouldn't go back to school --
L:  No.
R:  -- to do that at this point in your life?
L:  No, I already got a masters degree and other stuff.  And it's just like I've been to school [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah -- 
R:  You're done.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm done with that yeah and -- and I wouldn't trade the kids away for anything -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- so, the choice I made was right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, it's just one of those -- if I had -- if I had another chance someway, I would still have loved to have done that.  And maybe in my next life.  I don't know!  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Why not.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.  No kidding.
R:  Well, great.
L:  So -- 
R:  So, what happens now?
L:  Oh, we have to keep talking until ten minutes is up and then it then beeps 'cause it keeps recording our voices and our inflections because it's trying to figure out sound voice patterns so that they can create a something or other with, ah, the average voice pattern.  Whatever that is.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's --
R:  I think -- 
L:  -- a research study out of the University of Pennsylvania apparently.
R:  I don't even remember si- it looks like I signed up for this in December --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I didn't even -- when I started getting phone calls this evening I didn't even know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what the heck it's for.
L:  Are you a secret shopper?
R:  Am I a what?
L:  Do you do secret shopper things?  Mystery shopper things.
R:  No.  No, but it sounds mysterious.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] It is.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, t he people that go to, um, let's say a -- I don't know, we'll pick a big store.  A w- [MN] I don't know.  Nordstroms, Sears, something like that -- 
R:  I think -- 
L:  -- some big department store.  They hire groups o- of people -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, they hire a firm who sends pretend customers in who are looking for certain service items.  So, you go in looking for a blouse or whatever and, you know, approach the little sales lady and ask her if she can take you to pink blouses and -- and then you grade them, more or less, on their service, later.  And then the company pays you.  That's a secret shopper.
R:  Oh, interesting --
L:  And so they, um, they have a -- a national group and the group has a bulletin board of sorts on line and they sent out this email to the members of the -- of this group which I happen to belong to saying, ah, that this company, the University of Pennsylvania, was looking for voice samples at, oh, however much it was.  Ten bucks a phone call or something.  So, I was like, but that's only a painless source, like ten bucks you know -- 
R:  Really.
L:  -- so, I -- that's how I signed up was 'cause they -- I heard about it and they -- it's been a couple of months, I think, since I, ah, initially did.
R:  Wow, I can't even remember how I signed up.
L:  Huh.
R:  I'm going to have to -- after the call is done, well, I'm going to have to go back and figure it out.
L:  Go back and figure out.  I almost couldn't find my pin number because -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I couldn't remember [LAUGH] where I put it 'cause this is the first one.  So, when I first signed on --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- they gave me three minut- thirty seconds till I find myself [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so I took the thirty seconds to go find my pin number.
R:  That's great.
L:  So, anyway -- 
R:  Yeah, um, I -- I do a lot of online surveys so -- so maybe --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's -- maybe that's how I --
L:  That's probably where it is.  Yeah -- 
R:  -- got it.
L:  Because occasionally I do those but, ah, but typically I don't meet there -- whatever group it is that they want, or I'm -- 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- too late.  I log in like [inaudible] in the evening that, by the time they were advertising in the morning they're already full.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So -- 
R:  Those are -- 
L:  -- anyway.  This mystery shopper thing you might enjoy.  I don't know if you work during the day or -- or have -- 
R:  I do work --
L:  -- a [inaudible] or whatever --
R:  -- I'm -- yeah, I'm a teacher.
L:  -- but, like I work full time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but --
R:  And you still have --
L:  -- every night I get -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, through the five different groups that, um, solicit your services.  You have to go sign up at certain sites.  At first I thought it was kinda hokey.  I wasn't even really sure if it was up front, except I knew -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  --  my daughter worked at Staples for a long time and they had these people that came in and -- and bought stuff in their store and then assessed all of the customer service and sent back a report so I knew it was for real [several inaudible words] because she had been assessed that way.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, anyway I found a -- a site on line.  Made a searcy- searching mystery shopper or secret shopper and then signed up at, I don't know, a dozen or so sites and I've been getting emails off line for -- 
R:  Wow.  Do you -- do you recommend -- 
L:  -- about a year and a half I guess.
R:  -- do you recommend any in particular or do -- 
L:  Um.  Well, the way I got started I went to the money in shopping -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- look at the money in shopping dot com or something like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which is an organisation that, um, there's a master shopper organizer lady their -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- who has organized this website and she -- you don't have to go to everybody's website.  She has them all categorized off of hers.
R:  I see.
L:  So, instead of you doing the hunting, you use her page as the jump point to go -- hunt or get registered.  So, I think I paid twenty or twenty five dollars something to register -- register there initially -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but it was worth it to me for all of her resources and all of her connections and -- and, uh, just generic support and to get on her email list -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because as soon as you sign up then she starts sending, um, inf- informational emails about, um, opportunities at -- at different companies.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  And then once you start, you get a couple of jobs -- you can, um, a company finds out if you're reliable or whatever and then they'll send you more.  You -- you always have the opportunity to say, "No, you know, this isn't for me.  I --" 
R:  Interesting.
L:  "-- can't do it, I'm too busy" or whatever, or you could accept as many as you want to bet that you could actually go do.
R:  And, ah -- 
L:  So, they pay you, I don't know -- 
R:  -- what do you get paid?
L:  -- ten, fifteen bucks a -- a job.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so like, ah, for example I went to a Hollywood video, blockbuster --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- whatever, a week or so ago.  I had to go in and -- yeah, I had to go use the bathroom, look around the light fixtures and go ask for a certain kind of movie and then report back --
R:  Hello?  [MN] [NOISE]
