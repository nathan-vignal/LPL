L:  My name is Sheila.
R:  Hi, um, my name is Doris.
L:  Hi Dor-
R:  -- um.  Go ahead.
L:  What is -- I missed the -- the topic.  What is the topic?
R:  Ah, oh you missed it?
L:  Yeah.  I heard that it was time travel but it just -- 
R:  -- if you had to -- if you had an opportunity to go back in time and you had an opportunity to do something that, um, you had not done before that you wanted to do, what would it be?
L:  Oh, that's deep.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um.
R:  Ooh, I, um -- something I always wanted to do.  Um, something, um -- I guess for myself, ah, I would have wanted to have travelled, ah, to --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- every --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- continent, um, Australia, um, um, ah, Europe.  Um, I would have wanted to travel to most of the continents except those where it's cold.  So, if I had it to do over, then that's what I would do.  I would travel around the world basically.
L:  [COUGH] If there was something, um, a period in time that I could go back to and do something differently, um, I think I would have gone back to [NOISE] to my birth.  To my actual birth.  Um, um, had I been able to do something different [COUGH] I think I would have, ah, created a situation in which I could have had a relationship with my father from my birth.
R:  Okay.  And what are we supposed to do after this?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um [SIGH] I hope it's talk about --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- time travel, or maybe expand on, um -- on the topic.
R:  Okay.  [SIGH] 
L:  I think that, ah, for me not having my father present in my life, um, had a huge impact on my life.  I know that, ah, a- a- in the impact it was a negative -- definitely it was negative.  I know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that I made a lot of choices based on his absence.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A- a- and they weren't conscious choices.  And I made a lot of choices that, um, I may have done differently.  I'd like to think I'd have done differently had he had a presence in my life.
R:  Um, my -- I guess mine is so different.  My s- my topic is so different.  Um, I was, ah, exposed to travelling like when I was fifteen years old and, um --  
L:  How did that come about?
R:  Um, my aunt.  My aunt sent for me for the summer and, um, [NOISE] ah, we, ah, got in her car and we, ah, travelled.  Ah, I was living in Kentucky.  She lived in St Louis.  And, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, I had an opportunity to meet family.  Because basically in Kentucky there was no one there but my immediate family and so, ah, we, um, well we spent time with my family in St Louis which I have another aunt there.  And then, ah, we travelled on to Cleveland and I have googobs[?] of cousins there.  And, ah, so that was really my first time, ah, being with them 'cause the one aunt there has eight children.  And so then we travelled on to meet her aunt who lived in Boston and, ah, well that's my one and only time spending with my great aunt.  And so it was a great time to, ah, meet family that I had never known before and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- and interesting -- 
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- being exposed to some different culture.  [MN] Do you have a cold?
L:  Ah, yes and no.  Yes --
R:  Okay.  Is it allergies?
L:  -- [several inaudible words] and it's just smokers cough.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So, um, I've always had a love of travel and I always said one of these -- I was just gonna pack my -- ah, as a -- a kid I remember saying I was gonna pack my backpack and just travel around the world.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I -- I didn't do that.  But, I still have a great love for travelling.  It's not in my budget but, um, now and then I get to go somewhere.  So ... yeah --  
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- that's my love. 
L:  That's -- but have you, ah, did you time this call?
R:  No, I didn't 'cause we're only supposed to be on here for how long?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm not sure whether the robot will let us know.
R:  Oh, it was supposed to be a prompter that comes on.  Is it -- 
L:  To let us know when the ten minutes has expired.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  Well -- 
R:  It seems like it would be about that much time though now though, doesn't it?
L:  Right, it does.
R:  Um, 'cause -- oh, I don't have -- I'm not even -- I don't even have my clock right here with me.  But, if I remember her correctly, she said there would be a prompter.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN] I didn't know it was going to be like this, like, they called me and then they called you.  Or, had they called you before?
L:  They called a couple of times before but I wasn't available.
R:  Okay.  Okay, 'cause this -- 
L:  So, when they -- 
R:  -- okay.  This is my first, ah, call.
L:  Mine too.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I -- 'cause I had to look for my pin number.  So, now I'm going to have to keep it out.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- and where are you located?
L:  I'm in Chicago.
R:  Okay.  I'm in Atlanta.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, how's the weather there?  It's kinda grey day today.
L:  Well, actually, it was a beautiful day today.  Well, I believe it reached close to seventy today but the temperature is supposed to drop this evening. 
R:  Okay -- 
L:  And then -- 
R:  -- and it was seventy yesterday here --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Well see that's not unusual for Atlanta, right?
R:  Um, um, n- I guess this time of the year it's more of the rainy season.  It's just been a cloudy day and we've had, like -- I think they only said like a half an inch of rain.  The temperature --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- is sixty, so the temperature wise is pleasant.  It's just that it's a grey day.
L:  Okay.
R:  And yesterday was just absolutely gorgeous.  I mean, for it to be a Sunday -- everybody was out in the parks and just a great day.  I'm --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- going to have to put, um, my clock right by this phone too.  So --
L:  Well, I know we have exceeded ten minutes.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Well, take care.
L:  You too.
R:  Uh-huh.  Bye bye.
