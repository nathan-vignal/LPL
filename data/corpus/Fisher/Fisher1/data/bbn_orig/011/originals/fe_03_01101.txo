R:  Hi, my name is Nancy Sabato and I'm interested in opening up a coffee shop.  Um, I have been for a long time.
L:  Okay.  Hi, Nancy.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, thank you.  I'm Kevin.  I'm in Utah.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I can tell you from a place where they drink coffee [LAUGH] --
R:  I'm sorry, say that again, there's what?
L:  I can tell you from a place where they drink coffee.
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.  Yeah, we drink a lot of in New York.  [LAUGH] So, I'm from New Jersey, very close to Manhattan, about a half an hour away.
L:  Great.  Well, I'm from, um, Tucson originally, but living in Utah --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, ah, if I were to open my own business it would probably, ah, probably be a school because I'm getting, um, a masters degree right now in teaching --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ESL, English as a second language.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So --
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  How would you go about, ah, opening your own coffee shop if money weren't an issue?
R:  Um, well, what I would do is I would probably, um, I'm trying to, you know, work out details, I'm thinking like the future maybe in about ten years, um, possibly looking at, um, a good location --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that would be one and then finding enough square feet and enough, ah, room obviously for a kitchen and some kind of a, you know, coffee shop layout where they would have tables and a -- a coffee bar and, um, maybe help yourself but do the cappuccino and lattes behind the counter --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- type of like a Starbucks, but, ah, you know, a little nicer, a little more cosy and, ah, you know, more -- more like a mom and pop, but -- but not.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That type of thing.  I like what people w- -- people will be able to, ah, kind of meet each other and, um, you know, maybe have a relationships, or, um, just, you know, have, let's go out and have coffee tonight, we went to the movies, that kind of thing, or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, so, that's what I would like to do.
L:  Good --
R:  Um --
L:  -- I like -- I like coffee shops.  How would you -- how would you, ah, decorate it?
R:  Um, probably, I don't know, I -- I go back and forth with it.  Probably try like the Starbucks type of, ah, lighting where they -- they actually have a low lighting type, like a low but high, it's an odd kind of lighting to get you in the mood to drink coffee.  Um, that's how I would do the lighting, the inside, the core, would be small tables, enough to sit four, and, um, you know, basically, um, I don't know, not square floors, just something more cosy, um, you know, light in the decorating, not too light.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So.
L:  Would you have any food or internet connections?
R:  Um.  Yes, I probably would.  I would have, um, no -- I wouldn't make, like, dinner, any dinner type things, but maybe like sandwiches, you know, already made inside the cou- -- in the, um, you know, inside the glass case, um, probably breakfast food, ah, bars, things like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So.
L:  Would you have like any books or games around?
R:  Um.  Probably I would actually make it part bookshop, that's my whole thing.  I would really like to have it like a part bookshop where you can actually purchase books and read them, um, maybe -- I'm not sure -- but maybe like a TV in the corner, ah, couches kind of thing, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would have to really like see the size of the room, um, and how I'd want to lay things out, ah, you can't -- I'm just speculating, a lot of ideas going through my head.  I've -- I've had this idea for a long time, but with two kids going through college and it's not something for right now, but it will happen.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, how about you?
L:  Oh, wait, one more question.  Do you think --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- do you think you'd be a good business owner?
R:  I would be a great business owner.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  I've already had a business I ran out of my house for four years when my kids were little and, um, it was successful, ah, except for, you know, you were tied down to it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, I mean it is your life, you know, the phone is ringing and it's ringing in your house, you don't have a, you know, too much of a life --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, um, you know, y- -- you can make money, I mean it's -- there's a way of making money and I know that -- that, ah, there's ways of getting loans to get this going, it's just, you know, too hard now [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  So.  [MN]
L:  I might actually kind of change my -- my idea, because I'm not really a business oriented person, so I said I'd open my own language school or something, but I'd probably just buy a -- buy a -- um, a franchise kind of business that's already proven successful --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like what?  What are you interested in doing?
L:  Well, [SIGH] I don't know, I don't know [LAUGH] maybe like a Barnes and Noble or something because I'm the kind of the same, I like -- I like books and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things like that, but it costs a lot, you know, to -- to start your own franchise --
R:  How about like a place like -- like a -- a Caplin[?] institute where you're teaching kids and --
L:  Oh, that's true, yeah.  I guess Caplin would have some franchise opportunities.
R:  Yeah.  Something like that.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know.  And then you could basically set it up.  You could have your computers, you could have your -- your books, um, you could do referrals, things like that.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  And then I would -- I don't know, I guess as the owner of a Caplin kind of place I'd have to hire teachers or --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know, hire people to administer the tests and things like that.  So --
R:  Right.  Well, you can always start on your own, right, and then -- or if you know somebody that has a similar interest, you know, bring them in and then you could start off small and then make it bigger and it doesn't have to exactly be Caplin, but it could be something you design --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- out of your own head.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.
L:  I know you make a lot more money usually if you own your business, but every business owner I've seen does the -- like you say, have, you know, they're totally tied to the business and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- don't have a lot of free time.
R:  Yeah.  That's it, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you've got to choose.  It's either quality of life which is, you know, you check out at five, you're done, or, ah, you know, you -- you're tied to the -- but you know what, all in all, I have to say between the two -- because I work for a b- -- a company now and, um, I'm not -- not happy at all.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I haven't been since I worked there.  I've been looking to leave for the six years I've been there [LAUGH] so I mean, I -- after running a business, your time is yours and, um, there's nothing more gratifying at the end of the day than saying, you know, I did this, I created this and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this is amazing and look where it's gone and -- and every day can be a new thing.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every day can be a new experience, something new you learn about it, um, when you're working for someone else it's always the same crap year after year [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  I think that is a --
R:  -- same people --
L:  -- benefit, that it's a creative process, so --
R:  Absolutely.  
L:  -- whatever you can --
R:  And that's -- 
L:  -- dream.
R:  -- that's the spiritual journey of it all.
L:  Yeah [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.  So, it's just the money part that holds you back --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.  So, that's --
L:  I have a -- a friend who's a -- an artist in Tucson and, ah, we would always dream -- this is a few years ago when we still lived in the same city -- but we always dreamed that she'd have sort of like this coffee shop sort of place but it would also be, ah, a place for her to exhibit her own art --
R:  Excellent.
L:  -- and, ah, she was going to make it like a replica of the Taj Mahal [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there in the middle of the desert in Tucson, so --
R:  That's cool.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Sounds like a good idea to start from.
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I like what you said about location.  Location is so key.
R:  It is.
L:  There -- there was a -- this business that I thought was just the coolest thing in Tucson, but the location was bad and so it didn't stay open for more than a few months --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it was sort of the same idea, it was like a coffee shop, but they -- they showed films every, every, I don't know, like twice a week and, ah, they had -- it wasn't on TV, but they had like a full size screen inside of this, um, coffee shop --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and it was sort of, m- -- modeled after the gap too, with like wooden floors and, um, you know, things for sale.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.  It was a really neat idea.  It was in a way maybe too eclectic because it had, you know, too much going on and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, ah, but the location was the major problem.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's it.  You know what, I know from being -- owning my own business and reading like I just mega read over like everything about having your own business, um, one thing they said is -- is that if you ever want to buy a business or you wa- -- ever want to see how crowded something is, before you even decide, go sit in front, or across the street, from the store and see how much traffic passes, how much foot people, how m- -- people on foot --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, how m- -- where's the parking good, you know, um, because that's a big key.  Who wants to try and hike to get to a -- to a coffee shop or any establishment?  Nobody wants to hike.  They want parking right in front --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, and basically that -- that's -- that's the big key for retail.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So, ah, yeah, so, you know, it'll happen.  It just again, like not right now.  And, anything for you?  I feel like I'm manipulating this conversation.
L:  Oh, no, I just think that that's neat that you have that [MN] you know, a real dream that, you know, you're go- -- you're working at.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, for now, I'm -- I'm still getting, um, you know my education, finishing my masters degree and I'd like to get a doctorate and being in a -- you know, work at a university as a professor --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, ah, I don't know if -- unless it's a private university, I wouldn't really ha- -- have enough option to own, you know, the university or something, I would just be a professor for it.
R:  Right.  Right.  And you know, it's good to learn for a while, it sounds like you're young, so --
L:  Yeah, I'm twenty -- well, I'm not too young, I'm twenty eight.
R:  Well, that's young [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm in my forties and I've been there done that, see -- you know, I see people, you know, like you -- that, you know, pretty much just you have to -- you know what you have to do is you have to go out there and you have to work for somebody for a while and learn it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- learn how people do business and that's how you're going to learn how to do it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then you take -- if you ever decide that this isn't it, you take what you know and you put it, you know, towards something that, you know, you might feel it's fulfilling.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know -- everybody takes --
L:  I heard once that -- I heard a piece of advice, once, and I'll just share it with you, not that I can give you advice, because you know a lot more abo- -- but it was a neat idea and -- and I h- -- i- -- it was, ah, that if you want to be successful like at a certain thing
