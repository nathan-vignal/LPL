L:  Um, hello.  I'm Christie.
R:  Hi, my name is Christine.
L:  Okay.  And we're supposed to talk about if you could go back and change something.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  There's a lot of things I'd like to change if I could go back in time but I think, um, probably the one thing would have been, ah, the choices I made in education.  I would have made different choices.
L:  I would have done exactly the same thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It seems like -- 
L:  Really.
R:  -- you know, hindsight twenty twenty kind --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- of thing.  Um, what kind -- what kind of, ah, schooling did you --
L:  Well, I -- I -- 
R:  -- actually do?
L:  -- I didn't apply to the really good schools that I, um, that were courting me.  [LAUGH] 'Cause --
R:  [LAUGH] Would you have st-
L:  -- I was convinced that I couldn't get, um, financial aid and I couldn't afford to go [inaudible].
R:  Would you have still stayed in the same major do you think?  Yeah.
L:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.
R:  See, I think I would have picked a different major --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- altogether.  I mean, I was in school a long time ago [LAUGH] and --
L:  And so was I.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] um, I wa- I was a psychology major and I think I would have, um, leaned more towards science.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like a true science kinda thing.
L:  Well again, I got an electrical engineering degree and I didn't do real well because I stayed in state and I had to deal with my parents problems.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that was kind of, ah, you know.
R:  This is like -- 
L:  You know.
R:  -- I was a -- I, ah, -- I was so stubborn and pig headed I guess, back then.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, yeah, I refused any --  
L:  Aren't all teenagers like that?
R:  No I gu- I -- I -- I guess we are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when -- you know, that's normal.  That's like I, um, I refuse, you know, I -- I -- I mean, I would starve before I would've asked my mom for a dime [LAUGH], you know, kind of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so I worked full time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and went to school, so full time work was --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- the priority.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I really wish, you know, that -- like I had done a different major but that I had applied myself, gotten more out of it, you know, kind of thing 'cause I c-
L:  Well, I -- I think I would have gone to -- er, applied for better schools and applied for scholarships because I was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- talked out of applying for a couple of scholarships.
R:  Well, I -- I didn't even know about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like AEOG[?], um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- until my junior year --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- of college.  I mean, they don't tell you those things.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's like, if you don't know the right questions to ask --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then you don't get the answers, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's like, um, you know, I -- I wish there had been a -- a required course in highschool or something.
L:  Or, um, actually it's the guidance counselor's -- high school guidance counselor's job to tell you.  But, none of the guidance counselors I ever talked to did.  It was just, you know, the good kids in school talked about --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- this sort of thing 'cause their parents wanted them to go to school.
R:  Right.
L:  And they researched it and I, you know, and -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- so.
R:  -- and I -- my -- well, my mom was the first person in her family ever to even finish highschool.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, it was like that was a biggish -- big accomplishment, you know, kind of thing.  And so, my mom and my stepdad, it was kinda like just finish -- there whole goal was for my to finish highschool, not wind up pregnant [LAUGH] you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and when I finished highschool it was, you either go to college, go in the military or you get married.  Those were your three choices --
L:  Ew.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know?  I mean, it's so narrow minded but they thought they had accomplished a lot and they'd done -- done me good [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- kind of thing, whereas -- 
L:  [inaudible] and -- and they're done now [several inaudible words].  Well, thanks for trying[?]
R:  Yeah, you know, and of course back then, um, the legal age was twenty one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I was only seventeen.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, my mother was petrified what was she going to do with me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the next few [LAUGH] years, you know, kind of thing -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, because she was still legally responsible for me and all that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, I ah -- I -- I just think I could have -- I could've applied myself a lot better and I -- like I said, I would have done a different major.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something that I -- you know, I -- not that I don't use my psychology every single day -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in -- in life, but it's real hard to get a job.
L:  You don't get paid for it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You don't get paid for it, you know?  [LAUGH] But, you know, you don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get paid for it --  
L:  I'm actually going back to school to improve my GPA so that I can go to grad school.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, um, I'm -- I'm doing a real good job of improving my GPA but, um, that's definitely a should've, would've, could've kind of situation though.
R:  Are you going for a masters then in your same field in electrical engineering?
L:  Well, um, I'm going for, um, probably, um, depending on -- it's really iffy what I want to do, whether it's electrical engineering or computer science, depending on the school I apply to and so I'm getting a second bachelor's in computer science --
R:  Wow.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so that -- so that I can, um, have that option.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'cause there's a lot of stuff that is just so very close between --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the two.  But -- 
R:  Do you -- 
L:  -- [MN] I haven't studied any of the computer science stuff -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so.
R:  I just -- I -- I work with computers every day and everything -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the only thing I know is from trial and error.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And -- and -- and believe it or not I -- over the years, I -- I've gotten to where, like, the company I work for, I am their first line software support.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, internal software.
L:  That's always exciting.
R:  You know, the -- the computers not doing the right thing or my screen's crashing or this or that or -- and it's always me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they call, you know, kinda thing.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's like -- it's -- it kinda comes natural to me.  I enjoy [NOISE] it.  I enjoy the --
L:  It's very logical.
R:  -- challenge.  Ye- yeah.
L:  It's very logical.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] I'm the only person in my office that has an organized day.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I tell them I have to have it that way because otherwise I can't find anything.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, um, you know, and I think a lot of people are intimidated by computers and intimidated by science and that sort of thing and it -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's really not anything, you know, to be --
L:  -- when -- when I was in college, one of the things I did --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for spare cash was, um, tutoring students in maths -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- specifically.  And one of the really interesting things I discovered is that every single one of them had a serious issue with not just math but with a specific math instructor.
R:  Wow.
L:  Everybody could put a name to tha instructor which really surprised me.
R:  You know, thinking back I -- I can -- I can put a name to one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH] Yep.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and now you think it, and now --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that you mention it, that's w- that's --
L:  Er, yeah -- 
R:  -- interesting.
L:  -- every single student I had.  And once -- once I was able to work with them and get that identified they were able to overcome it.  But, until they were able to identify the source of why they hate maths -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, they -- they really continued to struggle.  But -- 
R:  That's interesting.  That is an interesting theory.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  To, ah -- to -- 
L:  Yeah, ah, it's -- it -- it was -- ah, there are some people that, um, that hasn't been true, I hear, but I would -- I would typically deal with the people who're smarter in other areas and able to think logically.  They just had a maths problem.  So -- 
R:  My -- my thing I was -- was if I did good in math, I didn't do good in English.  If I did good in English I didn't do good in math.  I couldn't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I couldn't concentrate.
L:  You couldn't do both.
R:  I couldn't focus on both at the same time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And -- and I tend to be --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that way as an adult is I can foc- I can -- if I need to really -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really focus on one thing, um -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I can -- I'm really good at focussing in on something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, everything else kinda falls to the side.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I kinda -- almost like total blinders.  Which is good, sometimes, but then again, you know, in their -- in real life you've got lots of different things going on and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you kinda have to give eq- equal attention to different things at any given time.  You can't just get real focussed on one thing and ignore everything else.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [NOISE] But -- how long are we supposed to do this for?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have no idea.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well this is the first one.  I mean, I signed up for this a long time ago -- 
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- but this is the first one I've done, so --  
L:  -- had to -- I had to beg for my pin.
R:  I -- [LAUGH]
L:  Because -- [LAUGH] 
R:  I kept saying, "Pin number?  Pin number?  Okay".
L:  Wh- where -- where --  
R:  Well, I'll just -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- it's probably the pin number I use for everything, you know -- 
L:  Uh-huh, mhm.
R:  -- like for my bank account and stuff -- 
L:  I tried that too, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and it didn't work.  And it said, "That's an invalid pin".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right, I was in exactly the same situation.
R:  And then it was like, "Okay, where's my paperwork?"  I just saw that the other day and was thinking about it.  So, I run and -- I had printed out, though, like the application --
L:  Oh, wow, okay.
R:  -- that -- that you did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No where on there does it say a pin number.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm saying, "Okay, I had to have gotten an email from them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, real quick, find it".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But, that's ...
L:  Mm.  I wasn't terribly quick.  I'm -- I'm kind of pleased that they held on for me, so -- 
R:  Yeah, it gave us plenty --
L:  Anyway.
R:  -- of time --
L:  Um --
R:  -- to, ah -- yeah.
L:  -- yes that is a good question.  How long have we been talking?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, um -- 
R:  You know, and it doesn't -- 
L:  I -- I think they've had a few bugs with the research -- 
R:  Really?
L:  -- because I -- I -- that would be my guess as to why -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] why it's been so long, so -- 
R:  Well, you know, I might have had calls from them but I never know, you know, because it just comes up as unavailable.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I just happen to be expecting a phone call from someone else this evening.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So when the phone rang I was kinda like, "Oh, hello" and then it --
L:  I -- I haven't --
R:  -- was like -- 
L:  -- received any other calls.
R:  But, I mean, I don't know because I see unavailable, you know, like when it came up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- lots of times I see unavailable calls have come in on my phone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I haven't been --
