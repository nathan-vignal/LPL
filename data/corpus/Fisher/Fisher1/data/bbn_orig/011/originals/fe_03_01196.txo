R:  Hello.  Oh -- 
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Doris.
L:  I'm Kim.
R:  Hi.  Um ... uh, for the million dollars [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... I don't think that I would do it because my best friend would be more important than that amount of money.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think I would do it either.  That -- that's not worth a million dollars [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Is that the only question they're going to ask?
L:  I'm not so sure.  [LAUGH] I've never done this before [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [SIGH].  Yeah, 'cause um ... then, I guess, you wouldn't have a friend any more.  Are they going to ask another question?
L:  I don't know.  Do we have to press anything or ...?
R:  Um ... I'm not sure.
L:  [LAUGH] Have you done these calls before?
R:  No.  They had um ... had me on hold forever and then uh, just until you got on.
L:  Oh, mm.
R:  So, today's the first day that I've ever done it.
L:  Yeah.  This is the first call I've ever taken too.
R:  Yeah.  I wasn't home yesterday but they left a message on my machine.  Yesterday was supposed to be about time travel.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't do it yesterday either 'cause I didn't have my pin number with me, so I couldn't do it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] How much are they even paying us for this, do you know?
L:  Um, I believe it's ten dollars.
R:  How long do we have to stay on here?
L:  Oh, wait, it says that um, "Call length is ten minutes and we ask that you speak on the proposed topic for at least eight [LAUGH] minutes" [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  You -- you just heard a message right now?
L:  No.  I'm reading this email that I got.
R:  Oh.  Oh, wait ... we're supposed to stay on the topic?
L:  I guess so but I don't know -- I don't have eight minutes worth of [LAUGH] something to say about it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.
L:  I mean, I -- I mean, I -- I just don't think a million dollars is worth it.  A best friend's friendship [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it kind --
L:  That's all I could s- --
R:  It kind of reminds me of that movie, Indecent Proposal?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah and that's like, kind of, it reminds me of that a little bit.  Or like that one movie where that guy won the lottery and um ... he was married to his wife or something and he had to give half to that lady who was a waitress, but --
L:  I never saw that movie.
R:  I -- um ... it was called It Could Happen To You.  It came out a long time --
L:  Yeah I -- I -- I remember seeing the previews to it but I've never seen it.
R:  Yeah.  I think he had broken up with his wife and then he had to give that lady, the waitress, half of -- 'cause he made the promise and he didn't want to go back on his promise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what are we supposed to do?  Do we just stay on the phone?
L:  I guess so.  It -- it says ... "After the ten minutes uh has expired, you will have the opportunity to leave feedback about the call".
R:  Oh, what -- what does that mean?
L:  I don't know [LAUGH].  I -- I guess, maybe after the ten minutes, we get disconnected and then it, like, maybe it asks you some other questions.
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't know.  That's all it says on here ... [SIGH].
R:  [SIGH] It's not gonna ask us --
L:  There's nothing really -- pardon?
R:  Oh, it's not gonna ask -- it's not gonna ask us another question?
L:  I don't -- I think it has to call you ... 'cause it says you can participate up -- in up to three calls, so I'm wondering if they have to call back on another day 'cause I bet it's the same topic the whole day.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  I think it is the same 'cause yesterday it had kept [MN] leaving messages on the machine, like, every half an hour when I was gone and it kept saying --
L:  Oh, I know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] My whole mailbox is filled up on my uh, telephone.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I only have a certain amount of uh messages I can, you know, keep on there [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was actually getting annoying [LAUGH] actually 'cause I didn't have my pin number with me.
R:  Because I -- I signed up until um any time from two to midnight so it kept calling, like, every half an hour until that time.
L:  Yeah, I signed -- well, actually, I signed up five to twe- -- uh, five to midnight and, like, [MN] I think the first call, it looked like five after five [LAUGH] it started calling today and I was still at work.  I didn't ... I couldn't -- I couldn't answer the phone and do this [MN] at work [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] And you'd probably get fired [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I didn't know this was -- I didn't realise this was -- I guess I didn't read the whole thing [LAUGH] to see what it was gonna be about [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah but every day it -- it should be different, though, which is good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um, they said we can only do three?  Is that the restriction?
L:  That's the [MN] yes, [MN] "You may participate in up to three calls".
R:  [NOISE] My daughter wants to talk [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... but she's too young.  She's like -- she's almost three.
L:  Mm [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] No, Jennifer, you can't talk.  [NOISE] I wonder how much longer we have.
L:  I don't know.  I can't tell.  My phone usually has it but since I've done all these other numbers on it, it doesn't have the time on there [LAUGH].
R:  Are you doing it on a cell phone?
L:  Yes.  I wonder if I can click that -- hold on a second [NOISE].  We've only been on seven minutes [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, that's good then.  We only have a few more minutes left [SIGH].
L:  Yeah, well -- yeah, actually, somewhere round three minutes [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know what else to say about the topic.  It was [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, I know.  I mean, I wish they would have asked [NOISE] some oth- -- some more questions.
L:  Yeah, a few more questions. I wonder what the time travel one was about yesterday [LAUGH].
R:  That would have been -- I think that would have been even worse to answer [NOISE].
L:  I know.
R:  Probably like, if people believe in time travel or not or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Does the um -- the email said that we had to stay on topic, is that what it said?
L:  That's what it says here.  It says, "The call length is ten minutes and we ask that you speak on the proposed topic for at least eight minutes" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh [LAUGH].  I wonder if they'll accept -- accept ours.
L:  I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It says, "Please give your opinions and the benefit of your personal experience and ask about the other person's experience and opinions" [LAUGH].
R:  But there is no experience.  I mean --
L:  I know.  I've never been asked about money [LAUGH].  Or someone's never told me that, you know, either give -- you know, if they give me a million dollars if I [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN].  So, what part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm in California.
L:  Oh.  I am too, so ... I wonder if they pick people that are on the same time zone [LAUGH]?
R:  Oh, yeah, may- ... maybe they do, yeah.  [NOISE] I live on, like, near Yosemite National Park.
L:  In where?
R:  Near Yosemite National Park.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm down um near um ... I'm in one of the cities near Los Angeles.  I'm  in Sevenoaks[?] in the valley [LAUGH].
R:  I lived down there for, like, a year and a half.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been here for three years.  I came from Chicago [LAUGH].
R:  What's it like in Chicago?
L:  Cold and windy [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.
L:  Most of the time.  No, it's a great city.  I -- I -- I miss a lot of stuff, like the -- the nightlife and the restaurants and all the things you can do in the city 'cause I lived in -- downtown.
R:  I have um family down there but I haven't seen them in years and I was there but I was, like, um so small when I was there that I just don't really remember anything.
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  But I wanted to go back there and visit and I might actually think about moving there.
L:  The only thing is the [MN] -- the weather [LAUGH].  That's why I moved out here [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I had lived in Washington DC for, like, two years and it was so cold there.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I guess I would get used to it.
L:  My time on here says ten fifteen, so probably I'll be going away in a minute 'cause the [LAUGH] ... I think it took, like, about a thirty seconds or forty to get on here, so ... I don't know how they -- what they do after they listen to it, if they [LAUGH] ...
R:  Well and this is for -- is this for um a university study?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that what it was?  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know.  It must be important for some reason, I don't know.
L:  It says, "Each call that you successfully record will give you a virtual -- virtual lottery ticket in the participant lottery and then you'll also receive ten dollars per call".
R:  But the [MN] the lottery is not going to be a million dollars.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
