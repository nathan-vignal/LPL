R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is Mary Doll calling.
R:  Um, my name is Sophie.
L:  Sophie?
R:  Yes.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Where do you live?
L:  In Wisconsin.
R:  Oh.  I'm in Chicago.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, well, up -- up near, um, Milwaukee --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, not all that far away.
R:  Indeed.  [MN]
L:  So --
R:  If you could open up your business and money was no object, what would you open up?
L:  You know, I probably would open up a -- a bakery or some such type of --
R:  [MN] Uh-huh.
L:  Um.  I like to cook --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like to make cookies.  
R:  Cool.  
L:  I'm told that I can make them edible, so [LAUGH].  
R:  That would be good.  That sounds great.  I've often thought about opening up a restaurant.  I cook, but I don't think I would be the cook per se --
L:  Mm.  
R:  -- if you were going to open up the cookie place or the bakery, would you do the cooking?
L:  Yeah, I'd probably do the cooking.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, it, um, so I'd have to have a manager --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I'm --
R:  Have you ever thought --
L:  -- I don't --
R:  -- a-
L:  Hmm?
R:  -- go ahead.
L:  No, what [LAUGH]?
R:  Have you ever thought about doing it for real?
L:  Well, not really because I enjoy what I'm doing it -- actually so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I kind of work for myself --
R:  As it is.
L:  -- yeah, as it is.  So, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's, um --
R:  Yeah, I -- actually, um, if I were to open up a business, I've often thought about opening like up a bookstore --
L:  Mm hmm.
R:  -- because I love books.  I used to be a teacher, um, so like a children's bookstore would be nice --
L:  Oh, that would be neat.
R:  -- but -- I've got to say, my husband has his own business and it's hard [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Um, that's -- that's probably the reason why I haven't thought of actually going ahead and doing that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now that my kids are out of the house, so it's probably, um, more of a possibility than it would have been --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- previously, so --
R:  Right.  It does sound -- I mean, it does seem appealing.  I would love to be able to be set my own hours like my husband can, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- leave work when he wants to and go on vacation, for the most part, you know, when he wants to and that's very appealing to me, but the -- the finan- -- I mean, I guess they said money was no object --
L:  That would still worry me.
R:  -- so maybe that's what their --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What?
L:  That would still worry me [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, for right now it would be no object --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but in --
R:  Well, that's the hypothetical situation part, apparently.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so, I mean, if that was the case, yes, I think I would open up a bookstore and I would like try and get children's authors into the bookstore and do little book discussions with kids and stuff and I think that would be fun.  I --
L:  That would be neat.
R:  -- I'd love to have food in there at some point, too, though.  Like [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, we could work together.  I could make you --
R:  There you go.
L:  -- a little -- a little, um, a little f- -- ah, not -- not- -- hors d'oeuvres -- what am I [inaudible] like not tea biscuits, but, you know, little itty bitty cookies that you can --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- sit and munch on while you're looking at --
R:  See, you know, that would be cool.
L:  -- different books. 
R:  Actually, I -- that seems like a good business.  I like the combination of reading and food.  I think it's a good one.
L:  There's this really neat coffee shop down -- downtown Hartford where I live here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they, um, have made it very, very homey and, ah, you can eat at a table or you can sit down at a couch and put your feet up on an ottoman --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or you can, um, ah, sit and have long conversations with your friends and they don't have a time limit --
R:  That's nice.
L:  So --
R:  So, it's -- is it a bookstore, too, or just a coffee shop or thing or ...?
L:  Um, it's basically -- I don't -- no, they don't have a, um, a bookstore in that area, no.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.  We just got a brand new, ah, oh, used to have a -- a used bookstore, but they just were called the Painted Lady and that one just went out of business --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- or moved or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not sure exactly why, I know it's got another little haberdashery type of --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- thing going in.
R:  How many people live in your town?
L:  Um, between nine and ten thousand.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it --
R:  So, you would know when businesses come and go, I would imagine?
L:  Yeah, the -- they have a pretty good little weekly newspaper that keeps everybody --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- tap [LAUGH].
R:  See, now, that's the kind of size community that I think, um, it would be fun to have your own business in because you'd know everybody that came in, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you would have your regulars everyday that would come in for your cookies, or whatever, like, I don't know, that seems very appealing to me, like in Chicago it's a very anonymous sort of place and I'm sure after a while you do get your regulars, but --
L:  Yeah.  And I think it's -- it's almost as hard in this kind of an area, it might seem like it'd be easier --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it's very, um, at least this -- this little portion of Wisconsin's very, um, oh, I don't know what -- not insular, but kind of like, um, provincial --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they -- you remain an outsider for a very long time [LAUGH].
R:  Is that right?  Are you -- are you from the town?
L:  No, I'm not [LAUGH].
R:  Ah.
L:  So, um, knowing, ah, knowing people is one thing and -- and you -- if you have -- if you have a reputation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's a lot easier to, um, if you've gone to school here and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if you've, you know, are one of the upper families --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or the families that were here forever and, ah, um, there was, ah, even my kids we -- they grew up here, most of them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, ah, started out here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, ah, um, they -- the one that -- the -- even my daughter who actually was born here -- oh, not born here, went through the whole school system here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, still had, ah, a hard time actually fitting in because we had a different kind of lifestyle or, um, I don't know, business ethic, work ethic --
R:  That's really interesting.
L:  -- whatever than a -- than a lot of the natives had --
R:  That's really interesting.
L:  -- so, yeah, so if -- it was just different and --
R:  So, if your kids grew up there, you've been there a long time.
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, about thirteen, fourteen years, now.
R:  So, you -- and you still feel that, that's fascinating.
L:  Yeah.  It I- -- it's -- it -- but that's a small town for you [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  So.  And even my mom, she was in a, ah, even a smaller community --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in Michigan and, um, they've lived there -- she's lived there, oh, probably close to forty years now and she's still not really looked upon as being a native of the town
R:  Isn't that something?
L:  [LAUGH] She's seventy five.  It's like --
R:  That is just crazy.
L:  -- how many times are you going to move, Mom [LAUGH]?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.  But my brothers feel like it's home --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because they -- they bas- -- they did grow up there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so, um, my -- my brother's on the school board, that kind of thing --
R:  Got ya.
L:  -- so he was able to make a -- a success and be -- become a part of, you know, the -- the landscape, I guess --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and I think that's a real big plus when you're looking to be successful in just about anything.
R:  Absolutely.  Definitely.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, that is really interesting.  Do you think you'll ever feel like you're, you know, part of the c- -- well --
L:  Yeah.  I think so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Eventually.  I -- at this point, it's not that big of an issue any more.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  It's -- I think it was more of an issue for my kids to feel like they were a part of a community --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that na- -- it's not like they were always -- they were ostracized or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it was just that they had a different attitude towards things and -- and, um, and they noticed it [LAUGH].
R:  Where did you move from?
L:  We moved, um, well, actually, we moved around a lot.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so they had a pretty cosmopolitan, um, outlook on life.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And pretty much were -- were acceptable of just about anything that could happen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they'd seen just about anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, ah, it was, um, they -- they couldn't understand sometimes the, um, the -- the -- I -- I don't know, parochialism or the -- you know, the, um, isolationism almost --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that some -- you know, what do you mean you've never driven to Milwaukee?  You know, it's only [LAUGH] --
R:  Isn't that something?
L:  -- twenty minutes away.  Oh, well, we can't go there because that's the big city [LAUGH].
R:  Isn't that something?  That is really -- I have found that to be -- I -- it's always amazing to me that there are people that have never left like their tiny little pocket of the world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, um, ah, people on the east coast that have never been to the mid west.  They don't even unders- they don't understand it as a concept, you know what I mean --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  -- like, wait a minute, where is that now?
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- it's bizarre to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that there are people like that.  And then a, um, friend of mine's husband has never been east of Chicago [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Wow.
R:  Which is, you know, I mean, there's a whole big country out -- a huge --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- country out there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that is fascinating to me and I think, I mean, your kids definitely have the advantage as they've been around --
L:  Yeah.  And I -- they -- and a lot of them that I'd say the older -- two of the older thr- -- um, not the oldest, the oldest's still pretty much a pretty good home girl, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anyway [LAUGH] she -- she needs to her mommy --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, um, the -- the next two in line both joined the Army --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- just to basically get out of this place [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so they could have a relationship with people that knew something other than --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, Hartford, Wisconsin.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it was really kind of cute --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I was like, "Well, I know why you're leaving" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "But do you have to join the Army?" 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, couldn't you just move to New York or something?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it's a little drastic, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Are they still in the Army?
L:  No [LAUGH].
R:  Good.
L:  Lucky for them, they were able to get [LAUGH] to just do their time and -- and, um, oh, my -- one of my sons is still in the -- in the Reserves --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, um, he's --
R:  How many kids do you have?
L:  I -- I only have -- we have five.
R:  Wow.
L:  So ...
R:  And they're all out of the house now?
L:  Yeah.  That's exciting.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  Yes.
R:  Because like you can't be that old.  I mean --
L:  Well, no.  But we started -- you know, you start early and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you'll end up with them leaving early [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's been kind of nice that way, but, um --
R:  [LAUGH] That's the opposite.  I'm old and I have a fifteen month old.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I mean, I'm not --
L:  That's so cute.
R:  -- I'm -- but I'm on the old side, I would imagine, of parenthood, thirty six.
L:  Well, you're thirty si- -- well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's okay.  I mean --
R:  That's -- so, yeah, so, we have the opposite thing, where it's like, wow, I mean, we tried to do all -- all our living before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and now we're looking at being insanely old parents --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- at our kids' high school graduation instead.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know about insanely old, but  --
R:  You know what I mean.  Like, it's -- it's really interesting.  I have a friend who's not much older than me whose kids are grown and so she's done [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just a whole different thing.
L:  Well, ah, it's -- it's a whole different, um, I know, I have a, ah, a girlfriend who's -- who actually lives in Woodridge --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and she basically started having kids a- -- I mean, like
