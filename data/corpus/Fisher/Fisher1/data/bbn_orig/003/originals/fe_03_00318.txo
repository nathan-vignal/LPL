R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Um, I'm Meg.
L:  How do you say your name again?
R:  Meg.
L:  Mike?
R:  M.E.G.  Yeah.  M.E.G.
L:  M- -- oh, Meg.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi, Meg.  I'm Sally.
R:  Sally.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Ah, Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, you're in Philadelphia.  I'm in the -- I'm in Maine.
R:  Oh, in Maine?  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, and you go to the college, the Penn St- -- the University of Pennsylvania?
R:  Well, I'm working there right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Are you working on the project?
R:  No, I -- I just heard about it, um, I'm working in the English as a Second Language Department --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- it's like, heard about it through them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Um, so the topic is drawing the line between --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- acceptable comedy and comedy in poor taste.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have any thoughts on that?
R:  Um.  [MN]  I think, yeah, it's a really, it's a tough issue, I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I -- there's so many different opinions as to what's offensive and what's not.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  I mean, maybe it's [COUGH] very individual --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I mean, I'm not sure what comedy in poor taste is, do you?  What does that mean, poor taste?
R:  I don't know.  I -- I think, I mean, I think you're right, it's -- it's completely individual and something I might think is in poor taste somebody else might think is very funny and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and completely acceptable.
L:  Mhm.  Well, are there like certain comedians you love and certain comedians you hate?
R:  Um, yeah, it's funny, you know, I -- there are a couple of comedians that I think are really funny, like I -- I actually, I really like, um, Robin Williams and George Carlin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but at times, you know, especially George Carlin, you know, some things I think he says are over the top and -- and bordering, you know, offensive or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- th- -- you know, something like that.  But at the same time I can still find the things that I find are funny in what he says and, you know, usually I- -- I don't usually take offense to the things he says, I just accept them as him -- his opinion and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, you know, maybe that other people find them funny.
L:  Oh, yeah, I mean, like I remember, I -- you sound to me young -- I don't know if you are -- but you sound to me younger than I am and I remember George Carlin when he started out.  And he was absolutely hilarious --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he didn't do -- he didn't do any like political comedy, um, and I think as he's gotten older he's gotten into more, um, like, like you said, telling his opinion [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Which is not something he started out doing and I agree with you.  I don't like it when he does that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I love Robin Williams.  Anything Robin Williams does I think is funny.
R:  Oh, I know.  He's so funny.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's just so -- he's brilliant [LAUGH].
L:  I know [LAUGH] but --
R:  Is there, um, humor that you find -- any comedians you find offensive or any humor your find offensive?
L:  Well, I -- I think -- I think actually you may have put your finger on what I get upset about, which is when comedians use comedy to -- to, um, as a kind of a political platform for themselves --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so I think that's why I have trouble with Bill Maher for instance because I don't really think everything he says is funny, I think he's -- he's just always trying to tell everybody what he thinks about this and what he thinks about that --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- I- -- not in a funny way, but in a, you know, in a straightforward way, or something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't mind satire.  I love satire.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If it's well done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I think that that's -- that's -- I -- I guess that's the challenge for a comedian, is to, um, say something funny about something serious without sort of, um, breaking the frame and sort of talking in his own voice, or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um --
R:  What do you do in Maine?
L:  I'm a College Professor and I have --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- an ESL background, actually.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I'm in the communications department, but my degree is in applied linguistics.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [COUGH] So, are you teaching ESL?
R:  No.  I, um, right now I'm just in the administrative side of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I've considered, you know, thinking about going -- going to Penn for the -- in order to get a degree --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I haven't quite decided yet.  I think I need to talk to some more of the teachers.
L:  It's a very good school.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I hear.
L:  Yeah.  And actually, there's someone here who's a graduate from, um, from Penn Linguistics in our Linguistics Program --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ah, teaching, so.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words], yeah.
R:  Mm.  I think it's -- I mean, it's interesting too when you bring in, um, when -- when you think about this topic in terms of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- international students,
L:  Yes.  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, um, you know, it's kind of -- it's very, you know, you bring in the idea of culture and what's funny in one culture is -- may not be at all in another and I always fi- -- I find that just very interesting.
L:  Mhm.  If I -- a long time ago, I went to Colombia University to observe [COUGH] an ESL class.  And the teacher did a very interesting exercise that I think I tried once, but you have to have a class of students from all different countries.  They can't all be from like the same country or something --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- and she put them into pairs, um, where each one in the pair was from a different country and she told them, for each person to tell the other what the comic stereotype of their nationality is in their culture.
R:  Oh, interesting.
L:  Which was hilarious [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The like, you know, French people were telling Germans what the comic German stereotype was in France --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then vice versa and the students were all like, Oh, that's not true and that's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- exaggerated and [several inaudible words] and they had a -- they [COUGH] they actually had fun with, um, with this and it was -- it was kind of both funny and culturally informing and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and it also gave everybody a chance to defend their own national comical stereotype.  And I thought --
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  -- yeah, I thought it was a great exercise.
R:  That sounds -- yeah, that sounds really fun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Might be something I should suggest to the teachers here --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like a fun activity --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, yeah, interesting, yeah.
L:  And I don't think anybody took offence, you know, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that because it was set up to be, you know, well this isn't -- you know, how your nationality really is, it's -- it's the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- comic stereotype of your nationality or something like that.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.  I thought that was very good.
R:  That's funny.  Yeah.
L:  And, like, have you been abroa- -- I've been abroad and there are these comic stereotypes of Americans, too.
R:  Oh, definitely, yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I lived in, um, in Costa Rica for --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a couple of years and, ah, the -- the stereotypes of people from the US and [several inaudible words] it's really interesting, I mean, there are some that you know are obvious, but others, you know, I never would have thought of until I talked, you know, I made friends down there and talked to them and --
L:  So, what was some of them in Costa Rica?
R:  Um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- well, some of them -- you know, some of them are just sort of the -- the loud, talking, US tourist --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- who, you know, goes down there and is very -- is very loud and, ah, not subtle at all [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and there's, um, a funny one with the cab drivers that, um, this is kind of different, but, you know, everyone up here has very heavy car doors and down there the cars are lot lighter, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, any time a -- a US tourist gets into a cab down there the cab drivers, does these signs posted in English, don't slam your doors and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sometimes the cab driver will actually get out, even if -- even if they -- they have no idea if you're going to slam the door or not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they'll still get out of their cab to open and shut the door for you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's funny.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have you run into any stereotypes?
L:  Yeah, well, I lived in Israel --
R:  Oh, wow --
L:  [COUGH] -- and there they -- they have a number of comic stereotypes, one being that Americans are sort of stupid and easily fooled.
R:  Oh.  Interesting.
L:  Um.  That -- that -- and -- and speaking of cab drivers, you know, that cab drivers can easily fool a tourist, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in terms of driving them around or, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, asking for more money than they deserve.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But in general, I think the -- the -- the attitude towards is Americans is that they're naive --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and that you can -- you can get what you want out of them, everything from money to sexual favors --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, the stereotype of American women is that they're very loose and sexually available --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and I 
R:  B-
L:  -- and I think that, I mean, I lived there for seventeen years --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and -- and you never -- and I was a -- I became a dual citizen, but you never lose this American identity --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they -- they look at you, they say, oh, she's the American [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Totally [LAUGH].
L:  Which is funny.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, so, yeah, I think, um, I -- I think there are some interesting comic national stereotypes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all around.  Also, I heard from some Japanese students that they look at Americans as very tall [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  They're like giants.
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny.  Yeah.
L:  And loud and talki- -- 
R:  And --
L:  -- you know, and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and not subtle, but they -- they think of them as very big.
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  And I'm very tall, so --
R:  Are you?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm very short.  So, I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- break that stereotype [LAUGH].
L:  Is there any, like, Philadelphia comedy?  I know that in the musical, one -- seventeen seventy six -- have you ever seen that musical?
R:  No.
L:  There -- there's a -- they made a movie of it, so you can get it in the video and it's about the continental congress in Philadelphia --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and there's, um, and there's a lot of, um, like put downs of Philadelphia by the colonial fathers [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Interesting.
L:  But I was wondering if there was any particular Philadelphia humor?
R:  There -- there is.  There's, um, there's actu- --there's a real strong Philadelphian accent, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- among certain parts of Philadelphia and, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's actually a book, it was called something Illy Phonetics, or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it has, you know, all the -- the -- you know, the way people talk down here, you know, there's a lot of, you know -- I went to breakfast this morning and the waiter greeted us, "How yous -- how yous doing?" you know, and --
L:  How yous doing?
R:  How yous doing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  And so a lot of people find that really funny and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I -- as far as -- it's hard because I've -- I've, you know, I've been gone a while --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I grew up here, so it's -- it's a kind of thing I probably would notice it more if I was somewhere else than -- than actually having grown up here, I don't notice, like, the -- ti- -- typical things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that maybe Philadelphians do.
L:  Do they make fun in Pennsylvania of, ah, the Amish, as comic characters?
R:  [MN]  Um, you know, I think -- I think that's, um, maybe one of the
