R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Ah, my name is Carla Mellinson.  I live in Salisbury, North Carolina.
L:  I'm Rosa Meller and I live in Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  All right.  My husband's from, ah, from Lancaster.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  And, ah, we've -- I'm originally from New York myself, but lo- -- lived in this area for the last, ah, last thirty years --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- came down for college and never left.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's nice down there.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Right.
R:  Yes it is.
L:  Right.  We're --
R:  But, ah --
L:  -- we're kind of cold up here.
R:  Yeah, I bet so.  Well, it's been cold around here too, I don't know if you heard about our ice storm a couple of weeks ago --
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  Yeah, but, oh, we -- we were without power almost four days --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it really makes you appreciate those electric lights.
L:  I'll say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'll say.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess we're supposed to, ah --
L:  We're supposed --
R:  -- dis- -- discuss this --
L:  -- to talk about our topic, right.
R:  Our topics, yeah.
L:  Okay.  Um, I can go, I -- I -- I would open a catering business.
R:  Ah.  Okay.  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  Okay, um.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I think I'd go about it, I'd, you know, have to, ah, I guess I'd -- I'd want to find an establishment where -- or some sort of a building where I could do all -- you know, have all the, ah, cooking done there and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then -- and work from out of there.
R:  Right.
L:  Um.  And I have a little bit of experience along those lines, not a whole lot, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I think that's what I would do.
R:  Okay.  That's interesting.
L:  How about you?
R:  Do you know, I am really at a loss.  I really can't think of, you know, any kind of business I would really be interested in running and -- and I say that because I -- I have worked for the State for almost thirty years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, ever since getting out of college, ah, I worked for, ah, for the local mental health system for, gosh, twenty two years and for the last five years I've worked for a local like a department of -- of, ah, social services --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like a, you know, family services kind of thing.  So, I have done agency work --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for the last twenty seven years and, gosh, I -- I just can't imagine life in the private sector, I guess, after all those years of, you know, working in, um, you know, in a governmental agency.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, um, so --
L:  Well, I'm a school teacher and every once --
R:  Are you?
L:  -- in a while --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, I think that there -- there might be some other kind of business that I might like to do --
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Life -- life outside -- what -- what, um -- what grade do you teach?
L:  I teach eighth grade.
R:  Eighth grade.  Okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  Middle school.
L:  Middle school.  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  What subject?
L:  Quite challenging.  Math.
R:  Math.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  And there's a lot of pressure, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Ah, everything that goes wrong is -- is the teacher's fault --
R:  Of course.
L:  So --
R:  And -- and, do you have, ah, there's been a lot in the, ah, newspaper around here about the end of grade testing and how much pressure the teachers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- are feeling to --
L:  Un --
R:  -- you know, perform for the tests.
L:  -- unbelievable.  We do a city test, we do a state test and then we do a proficiency test for the next -- for the high school.  It's -- it's just the kids are tested out --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and by the time the second test rolls around, they don't even care what they're marking.
R:  Exactly --
L:  You know we--
R:  You know, when -- when I worked at mental health I worked in the field of -- of testing, both group testing and individual testing and I know a lot of times, especially middle school kids, they don't take this stuff seriously.
L:  No, they don't.  They think --
R:  You know.
L:  -- it's all fun and games --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you know.  And rightly so, because it -- it takes up about three weeks of their time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it -- it's just really tough --
R:  Gee.
L:  -- so every now and then I think that the catering business might be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something that would be nice.  
R:  Just seems real low --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- real enticing somedays, huh?
L:  Yeah.  I like the idea of it because it's not a restaurant, you know, where you have to wait for customers to come in --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- where somebody books up ahead, you know, and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and you know exactly where you stand.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that would be neat.  That would be neat.
L:  I kind of did as a volunteer for, you know, quite a few years I did a fashion show, it was always like for one hundred twenty five people --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the only thing that scares me is if I, you know, you have a -- a problem with the food or something like that and people get sick --
R:  Oh, gosh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whoa, that -- yeah, that -- that would be bad.
L:  I hate to even think of things like that.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Right.  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess where I am is pretty good.
R:  There you go.
L:  You know --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- you get your paycheck and you have your days off and your --
R:  Right.
L:  -- holidays and all that --
R:  Retirement system the --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know about a business --
R:  Right.  Yeah, me --
L:  -- especially at this age of life.  You know --
R:  That's true.  That's true.  Yeah.  Well, it has been interesting talking with you.
L:  Yes.
R:  Is this the first call that you've made like this for -- for this --
L:  It's the first call for a long, long time, oh, I guess I did it about three or four years ago.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  But this is the first one in a long while.
R:  Well, this -- this is my first one ever.  My daughter is -- is a graduate student at, ah, North Carolina State University --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in the linguistics programme --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and so that's -- that's how she heard about this and so she emailed, you know, all of us in the family and her friends, saying --
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  -- "You gotta sign up to do this" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "it sounds really interesting and you get ten bucks per call" --
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's fun.
R:  -- so, I said, "Gee, why not?  It sounds interesting".  Yeah.
L:  Right.  You get paid for talking on the phone.
R:  Hey.  That -- that -- that -- that's right down my alley.
L:  Right.  Now, I don't know, do we have to talk until they tell us we've finished?
R:  You know, I got this little paper in front of me.  Ah, let's see, keep the conversa- -- please speak on the subjected -- suggested topic, give your opinions, ask about the other person.  It doesn't -- it doesn't say how to end the phone call.
L:  Okay.
R:  It doesn't say.  I guess --
L:  I imagine they'll buzz in and -- and they'll intercept.  I don't remember how it used to be.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, um.
R:  Okay.  Well, you know, they -- they don't say, you know, number of minutes or anything like that --
L:  No.
R:  -- so, I -- I guess, do you suppose we could just hang up when we're done?
L:  I don't know.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Okay.
L:  I know one -- one thing about a catering business, you know, or any kind of business --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you definitely want to own your establishment.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Because I know, I have a friend at school who opened a business in a strip mall --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, the mall came in -- she had a deli -- and right next door --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- they were in the business a year and the -- the store next door was vacant --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they came in and they put in another eating establishment --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and she said, "It -- it just took the top right off of her business" --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- and she's --
R:  Well, I wonder why they did that?
L:  -- really upset about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, she said it's the mall.  There's one dollar store at one end and there's another dollar store at the other end --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which was, you know, very bad --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for business, that is --
R:  Sure.  Tough.
L:  So, um, you know, I -- I know you really have to, ah, own your business --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and sometimes that takes a little bit of money --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and whether or not you're willing to do that, you know, I think, yeah, I know that you have to young blood involved, too, you know, you have to have somebody with ideas and what not --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- but we --
R:  Someone that willing to put in long hours --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to make it work.
L:  Right.  We recently went to a wedding and a woman, ah, her name -- she goes by the name of Jewel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she had catered this affair and she has a, you know, a retinue of people working for her and, oh, she did a wonderful job.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it just, you know, makes you think, gee whiz, maybe I could have done something like that, or I guess at this -- at this point I don't think I would consider it, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if -- if I had to open a business, that's what I would do.
R:  That's -- that's what you would do.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  You still haven't come up with something?
R:  I -- see, I really haven't.  I really haven't.  Um, you know, I'm trying to think.  My -- my parents were both self employed, my dad was a, um, you know, was, um, was a builder and, ah, and my mom ran -- when I was very young, actually ran a -- a restaurant --
L:  How about that?
R:  -- you know, like a dairy bar type of thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, short -- you know, let me see, I'm s- -- I think she was open for breakfast, but, you know, lunch and, ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, supper, you know, hamburgers and hot dogs and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- ice cream and -- and all of that.  So, you know, so both of them were -- were, you know, business owners --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- I grew up in that kind of environment, but gosh, I don't know, I just never, never felt the, ah, you know, the -- the inclination to, ah, you know, to have my own business.  I remember, you know, my dad saying, "Oh, my gosh, you know, you have got to pay, you know, pay taxes" you know, paying taxes was something you did, you know, once a year instead of having it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, taken out of a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- paycheck every two weeks --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, having to go through an accountant to do his taxes and --
L:  Right.  I remember, yeah.
R:  -- yeah, you know, and it -- it always seemed like such a hassle --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, keeping up with all of that stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, I remember, gosh, I was probably about ten and he fell one time from a ladder and, um, oh, broke several ribs and punctured a lung and, you know, was out of work, you know, for a number of weeks and I remember him just fretting about -- and now, they -- they, you know, he did get workman's comp, but, you know, that wasn't much --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he's, "Oh, how are we going to pay the bills, how are we going to do this?" you know, and, like we were saying before, you know, when -- when you've got a -- ah, you know, a steady job that's not in the business sector --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then, um, you know, you've got your -- you know, paid sick leave or vacation --
L:  That's right.  That's right.
R:  -- or whatever.  You know.  You're -- you're --
L:  There --
R:  -- pretty much set.
L:  A lot less responsibility.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  So, you know, when -- when they said that the, um, you know, the topic before starting the phone call, I thought, "Oh, my gosh, I'm at a loss, that is truly not something that -- that I, you know, really have ever thought that I'd be interested in doing" --
L:  Right.
R:  So, um --
L:  Well, my sister in law opened a store, um, years ago and she just had the idea of buying up all sorts of fan paraphernalia --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, like for Phillys and then the Eagles and stuff like that --
R:  Okay.  Yeah, like a sport -- sport store, yeah.
L:  -- and [inaudible] -- like a sport store, before they had those big sport stores --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- and boy, she really did well.  A couple of years when the Phillys won the pennants --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, she would go out, like immediately, and get stuff she knew -- she had good contacts --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the people just bought that like crazy.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, she really did well.  But then, once again, the mall put her out of business because --
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  -- they kept raising the rent --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to the point where, you know, she just couldn't compete with these big major chains --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she was out.
R:  Because those big chains can --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, just -- just charge just the barest, you know, margin of profit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, you know, they have so much volume, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, but the little, you know --
L:  Right.
R: -- little dealers can't do that.  So [LAUGH] and there's -- there's another reason, I guess, why -- why it just never appealed to me, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but -- but, you know, but there's some people who are just wildly successful in business and make way more than you --
L:  I know.
R:  -- would ever make in the public sector.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, ah, yeah, I guess it's just a matter of, you know, timing and hard work --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and good luck, probably --
L:  And good luck, yeah.
R:  -- as much as anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think so.
R:  Gee.
L:  So.  Well, I guess if it doesn't say any time limit --
R:  Okay, I guess that you -- well, maybe --
L:  -- you know, what do you think?
R:  -- maybe we can, you know, just sign off and they'll, you know, do -- do whatever they do --
L:  Do what they have to do.
R:  -- yeah, because this -- yeah, this doesn't say anything about a time limit and, you know, uh, I don't -- I don't guess they break into the conversation and say, "You can stop talking now".
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Like I said, it's -- it's been so long since I've done that --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't remember from before --
L:  But, you know --
R:  -- you know, how they did it.
L:  -- if they don't give you a time limit, they could very -- you could very well hang up after a minute --
R:  Oh, that -- right.  Right.  Yeah.  Just, you know, say a few things and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and stop.  So, well, I guess we've probably talked long enough.
L:  I think so.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, it was nice to talk to you.
R:  Very nice to talk to you, too.  And you take care.
L:  And maybe our paths will cross again.
R:  Maybe so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I hope you have a wonderful Christmas.
L:  Thanks.  You, too.
R:  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye, bye.
L:  Bye, bye.
