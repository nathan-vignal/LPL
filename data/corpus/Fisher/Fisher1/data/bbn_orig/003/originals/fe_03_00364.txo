L:  My hobbie- [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Actually I was thinking about [LAUGH] that while I'm wait- -- I was waiting --
R: Mhm.
L:  -- to call[?] and, [SIGH] mm, [COUGH] probably [SIGH] might be -- I can say I like, ah, mm, listening to music, reading books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe just to take, you know, walks maybe.
R:  Okay.  What kinds of books do you tend to read?
L:  Mm, think, ah, when I was a university student I used to read, uh, novels.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, um, most of the time I read, ah, children's books and maybe some books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, about religion.
R:  Okay.
L:  What's your hobby?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I also do a lot of reading.  Um, I love to watch movies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, probably my biggest hobby is dancing.

R:  Yeah, I do a lot of swing dancing.
L:  [SIGH] Swing dancing?
R:  Mhm.

R:  -- probably the hobby that take up the majority of my time, that and yoga.
L:  Oh really?
R:  So 
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But, ah --
L:  Yeah, I think I need a something that I have to move my body --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because usually I sit and ride the house[?].
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Actually I went to meditation center --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- mm, maybe for eight months.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, maybe it was five years ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mm, and I think it's sort of related to yoga, maybe.
R:  Oh definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, one of my yoga instructors has us do kind of meditation at the beginning of our practice.
L:  Mm.
R:  So  [COUGH] I'm not very good at the meditation portion though. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I find it very difficult to quiet my mind like he --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- asks you to do.
L:  That's right.  Yeah, yeah I understand what you mean.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's, ah, hard, yeah --
R:  Oh definitely.
L:  -- to empty your --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- could I say -- mind?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Every --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- time, every moment you think about something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's harder to stop thinking.
R:  Oh yeah.  My mind just wanders wherever --
L:  Mm.
R:  I -- it's crazy.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, ah, how much time do you figure you spend on your hobbies each week?
L:  Mm, if I walked -- I work too, so and I was really [several inaudible words], so maybe the weekends and, um, maybe one or two hours a day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, now I'm a student, so -- this is my winter vacation, so I have a lot of time [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- to read books and taking a walk, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't do them much.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I became lazier and lazier.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I have a pile of books to read now. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I borrowed from the library -- you know, this library and the [inaudible] that library and I borrowed some books from my friends and  but [SIGH] I didn't start reading much because Christmas party and New Year's Day and [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-uh yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- so many things going on, so --
R:  Oh yeah, lots of friends to hang out with and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff. [COUGH]  Yeah, it's been a very busy holiday season.
L:  Mhm.  So -- so, I -- today I started reading some books for my study --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, I think I have to make a kind of a schedule, a daily schedule.
R:  Yes.  Kind of keep yourself on track.
L:  Right, yeah.  Um, I like to -- having a quiet time in the morning.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, [SIGH] uh, oh, I think a since I had vacation I didn't do that [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- regularly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, yeah, I need to do that, mm.  So, you do danc- in your house or you --
R:  Um. 
L:  -- go to some --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- place to dance?
R:  No, usually I go out and dance with friends.  Like tomorrow night, there's a swing dance that I'm going to.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um.
L:  But, there's a sort -- certain place, a specific place that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you can dance?
R:  Yeah, there are different --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- places that you can go.  Um, actually here in Portland, there are several ballrooms that --
L:  But you are from --
R:  -- specialize --
L:  Portland?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, yeah.  Here I'm in Arizona. [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you?
L:  Arizona.
R:  Okay, Arizona.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm. [LIPSMACK]
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  So, I usually -- I usually go out swing dancing a couple of times a week.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then, the rest of the week I go to a dance studio that has different types of dancing, like Mia[?] and soul motion.  Um, they also have yoga classes and stuff.  And so, I'm -- I generally go there every day.
L:  Mm.
R:  Like today I went in for a Mia class and --
L:  Mhm.  [SIGH] But, when did you learn, you know, how --
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  -- to swing dance?
R:  -- the swing dancing I learned  I think I started about three and a half years ago.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Um.
L:  And did you have any re- -- reason to start swing dance?
R:  A friend of mine came to visit to go to the Portland Dance Festival --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that summer, and she got me to go out with her 'cause they had some free lessons on Friday nights.
L:  [MN]
R:  And so I took a couple of different lessons.  I took West Coast swing, East Coast swing.
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Um, oh, a two step lesson and then a line dance lesson.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I ended up really, really liking the West Coast swing lesson.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And another lesson that I took that weekend was from a, a really great instructor here in --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- Portland, and so I decided that I wanted to take lessons from him.
L:  Mm.
R:  And started, and simply haven't stopped. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause it's --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so much fun.
L:  Yeah.  I want to learn something that, you know, I have to move --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and maybe, you know, it'd be great to learn, you know, how to dance.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Is there a -- yeah, I -- I like to learn, but [LAUGH] I don't know.  I want --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to take, ah, some class here.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  It's a lot of work [LAUGH] if I -- if I decide to take some class, you know, dancing class, then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there are so many requirements.
R:  [NOISE] Oh yes.
L:  You have to go to maybe some discotheque or some place at least five times a semester [LAUGH] and --
R:  Mm.
L: -- you have to pass --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- er, exams and so  [MN]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Hullo?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh yeah I --
R:  Um, I've -- I mean, I started out just taking one lesson a week --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I did that for several months before I actually would go out and dance socially.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then the people that I was taking lessons with -- 'cause they're group lessons -- um, [LIPSMACK] basically made me go. [LAUGH]  They were like --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- you have to practice, you have to practice.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And so they took me out.  And every Tuesday --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we were meeting at a club here in town 'cause there was a DJ who would play music for us.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And they basically made me go and made me dance. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, it was -- I was always very nervous at first because --
L:  Yeah, yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I was so awful. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  And I felt bad about, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people dancing with me because I was so terrible. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  But -- but that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- part of the learning process.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's -- you have to get out there and you have to practice, and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's the hardest part 'cause I felt so embarrassed about how bad I was.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But everyone's really nice, you know, and that's the thing is people understand that you're learning, people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are very patient and generally people are very helpful.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, you know, and I've made a lot of friends --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- as a result of the dancing.
L:  Ah.
R:  You know, people I wouldn't have met otherwise.
L:  Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, I think I understand what -- mm.
R:  [NOISE] But, yeah. [NOISE] So what book are you reading now?
L:  I'm reading, um, [COUGH] -- I don't know quite [LAUGH] ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hope has its reading.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I just started.  And then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I also I was reading, uh, The --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Case for Faith.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know that book?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, and I read [LAUGH] several books at the same time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:   Mhm.  And I like reading children's books.
R:  [NOISE]

R:  So do I.
L:  Yeah, I -- I like to--
