R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Ah --
L:  Hi. I- -- I'm Larry.
R:  I'm Lynica.
L:  How do you do?
R:  I'm all right.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  Um, not really too sure on how to start all this.
R:  Oh, yeah, well, there you go.  Wherever.
L:  Okay.  Well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I was in the airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, yesterday.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was, well, a lot of guys just standing around doing nothing.
R:  Yeah.  What do you mean, security guys?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There were so few people flying that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, most of them were just standing around doing nothing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  Oh, and this is like the extra personnel or whatever that they've hired?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  I haven't been on an airplane for a few months, but I've noticed it's been, you know, it's crazy 'cause we'll go through one time and get every single thing on us searched and then -- you know, I don't know.
L:  Well, I think what's interesting is that, um, they announce that you'll -- you'll have some of -- some of the crowd be pulled off to be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and it's profiling and I'm curious as to --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what their profile is.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I am, too.  Supposedly it's supposed to be random, but -- now, I know the last time that we flew, I think it really was because everybody who had a certain thing on their ticket, like a little black and white thing along the bottom of the boarding pass was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they were the ones pulled over and -- including us -- but, I don't think that's always true, at all.
L:  You know, I didn't notice that, ah --
R:  Yeah.  Well, this is South West, I don't think it's true of all the airlines.
L:  Hm.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, because I'm -- I'm trying to think about -- if I've ever noticed that and I haven't --
R:  Mhm.  Well, I only noticed because somebody -- because somebody that we know who works for South West pointed it out to us, you know, ev- -- all the boarding passes with checkerboards get pulled over.  But that's really crazy, too, because they have checkerboards if they're standby tickets.  So, I mean, what -- what kind of -- I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- selection is that, everybody who's on a standby should be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- should be, ah, searched, I don't know.
L:  Well, one of the things about airport security that I noticed is that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I really didn't feel very secure because of it --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- because mostly they looked like people that would be working at McDonalds.
R:  Oh, the security people?  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I've heard a lot of stuff on the radio, ah, about, you know, people who have been doing this for fifteen years or something who are getting thrown out of their jobs because, I don't remember in one case it was somebody who, you know, was a legal permanent resident, but hadn't taken citizenship and she'd been doing this job for, you know, fifteen years, or whatever, but if she didn't get citizenship by -- within a month or something then she lost her job.  Because they were only going to let citizens be airport security workers.  Um.
L:  Yeah.  You know, um --
R:  I mean, I -- I -- to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whether you're an American citizen or not doesn't have anything to do with whether you're dangerous or not.  You know, there could be a Timothy McVeigh[?] working the airport.
L:  Yeah, I think that's somewhat independent, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Because, um, I mean, I mean, going to school and being at a university --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you -- you run into people from all over the world.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  And, you know, like, that's totally independent.  I think the -- the thing that really kind of strikes me is that I really want to know what's going into the cargo hold of that plane.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And in -- and then, yesterday [COUGH], when I was flying home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, this gentleman who I'm not sure exactly what nationality he was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but he was of some foreign descent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who spoke very broken English --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I couldn't really tell what his accent was, but he had a walking stick --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, they supposedly took a look at the wa- -- walking stick --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I -- I kind of looked at that and I said, "Geeze, you know, why is he allowed to bring that onto the plane?"
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I -- I just really --
R:  Well, I don't know.
L:  -- bothered the daylights out of me, you know.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  And he sat next to me, no less.  I mean, oh, my god, I mean, I'm sitting there and all of a sudden he sits next to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I said, well, then, um, I'm just going to keep an eye open huh.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, whether he's sitting next to you, whether he's sitting on the other end of the plane, if he's going to crash your plane, it's all the same.
L:  Well, yeah, and I -- I was kind of thinking about that and saying, well, you know, there's all these rules for all these things and then he's got this, like, club with a point on the end --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what in the heck is this doing here?
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, airport security, well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that training --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is in order here, ladies and gentlemen.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, certainly given -- sometimes we get searched up and down and then sometimes they will let me through with what's really lax, I mean, even not considering that nine eleven ever happened, but just -- just in general what you would consider to be a normal level of security and, you know, sometimes they don't even care, so I could easily be carrying something on there, so somebody else could too, I don't know.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- um, I've no problems with the screening.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like, x ray it, do whatever you want --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, go for it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
R:  [several inaudible words] when it causes massive delays in airports, pretty [inaudible] --
L:  Well, you know, I have seen, um, let's put it this way.  I -- I've seen them put people in embarrassing situations.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  And I understand that they want this to be out in the open and so on and so forth, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when -- when they start saying, okay, you know, like, let's see your belt and like pull --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- off your belt and now roll -- start -- start rolling down the hem of the top of your dress and stuff like that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I go, wait a minute.
R:  Yeah, that's too much.
L:  You know.  And like, I actually saw a girl go through that and I went, this is wrong.  If that was my wife, I would be screaming.
R:  For sure.  The last time we went to the airport my husband was -- ended up with his, you know, his shoes off and his belt off and like everything that he could take off, off, you know.  Ah, just like [MN] pretty soon you're going to have people undressing out here.
L:  Yeah.  Doing the old strip search.  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  I didn't -- I -- I have to say that the thing that bothers me the most is when we came back to the States this February, I guess it was, was having, ah, I don't know if they're Army, I don't know how they are, but guys with big old nasty machine guns standing around the airport.
L:  Well, I mean, if you travel abroad, I mean, that's just normal fare.
R:  Um, not -- not anywhere I've traveled.  I don't know.
L:  Well, you go to the UK and it's normal and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- oh, yeah.
R:  No, I've never been there.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I guess in Japan, I mean the police don't even carry guns.  So ...
L:  Right.
R:  But.
L:  Well, I've been in Japan also and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, it's, um --
R:  But their security when we left was really tight and -- but, they're very polite about it.
L:  Right.
R:  Very, very polite.  I mean, they'll go through your whole bag and then they'll shut it all up neatly for you and say, thank you.  And you're on your way.
L:  Right.  Well, they -- they don't openly have the +weaponry.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  I'm sure it's there.
R:  Well, the Army's got it, but the police don't carry -- don't carry firearms.  They can't.
L:  Well, at the airport I'm sure it's there.
R:  Um, yeah, probably somewhere.
L:  But I don't think that it's out to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do the sort of brazen look at what we got --
R:  No.  Yeah.
L:  -- we dare you to do anything kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah, I kind of disagree with that because I don't like a police state --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  For sure.
L:  -- I -- I understand that there's a -- there's a need for that and thank God that there's people that do that, but I don't think that airport security --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- has to go to that -- that --
R:  Well, I mean, because if you find somebody, I mean, I -- I'm just not sure what you're going to accomplish with a machine gun if you've got enough security forces there you don't -- I mean, especially in a place with that kind of crowds, I mean I just don't think that's right.  You know.  To get in the middle of -- of the public where there's thousands of people coming in and out.
L:  Well, frankly, is that -- I -- I think that the screening process is all wrong because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you did find somebody, what in the heck are you going to do with them?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  I mean, here you're standing with the largest -- almost the largest density of people when there is a rush --
R:  Right.
L:  -- right there at the screening --
R:  Right.  I'd be curious to know, do they have a plan for evacuating the airport or whatever?  You know, if they somebody with --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  You know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ladies and Gentlemen, find the nearest exit.  Good luck.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  You know.  But I -- I -- I think that if they did find someone who was really a security threat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would it really be intelligent to shake 'em down amongst all the rest of the folks, because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if this person was of the mindset --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be there with what anyone basically should know they shouldn't be there with --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know, +weaponry or whatever --
R:  Right.  Yeah.  How are they going to react?
L:  -- you know, why are you going to jeopardize the security of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all those folks --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- around them --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- so there should be like a tiered process --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where if someone is identified --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're allowed to go through, but they're picked up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at some other place --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where it is safe, away from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the rest of the folks.
R:  Yeah.  And it seems like having enough personnel and having, you know, some kind of, I don't know, having handcuffs, having a stun gun or whatever, having restraints and whatever you're going to have is one thing, but having, I just don't like seeing machines in the middle of people.  It -- what it makes me think of is when I went to Guatemala, you know, ten years ago and there's people standing on the street corners with machine guns, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's not what I want to see in my airport.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know -- I don't know, I think that makes it seem like a -- I think that -- I don't know, it's a scarier --
L:  Well, one would hope that we're more civilized than that.
R:  -- situation to be in.  Mhm.
L:  But if --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- we really are as technologically advanced as we tout to be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- why can't we figure out a better way of doing this?  Ah --
R:  Mhm.  Oh, well, ow.  I mean, that's -- that's the thing, if -- it's not about technology, and that's the whole point of why, you know, the hijackers are able to carry this off, because you just figure out a low tech solution and there's going to be lots of those and there's going to -- there's no way that you can prevent them all.
L:  Well, yeah, I mean, w- -- you're -- you're right --
R:  Like, what to do when you see --
L:  -- and I agree with you.
R:  I mean, what do you do when you see that somebody has all the technology and that's the obvious -- that's, you know, not -- I'm not saying it's intelligent to be a terrorist, but if you're going to -- if you have a plan, I mean, the -- your best chance is to go with the opposite route, you know, if somebody's bristled to the teeth with -- with technology and with weaponry, well, you go with the low tech route and it's obvious that's --
L:  That's what they did.
R:  -- what they did, yeah.
L:  But I -- I guess what I was trying to get at was that if there was a tiered process --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the technology should be in place --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be able to screen you if you do have traces of, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- explosives on you or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- contraband or whatever the case may be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  And I -- I -- I think that if you are going into a public arena --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you do in some ways -- are placed in a position of surrendering your personal rights.
R:  Well, I don't think you're in a place of surrendering your personal -- I don't think you should ever have to surrender your rights to be anywhere, otherwise you'd be in your house all the time, but [MN] to be under certain obligations, yeah, I mean, the -- not rights, but there -- there -- there are limits to what you can do in public, for sure.  I mean, there are limits, there are certainly you can expect to be, you know
