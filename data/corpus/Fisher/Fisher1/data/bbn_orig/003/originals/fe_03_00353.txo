R:  [COUGH] Hello, this --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- is Jeff[?].  Hi.
L:  My name --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- is Lynne[?].
R:  Hello Lynne.  This is Jeff.
L:  Nice to meet you. [SIGH]
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Um, so what kind of business would you open?
R:  Um, [COUGH], well I think that for a business that I might like to be a research consultant.
L:  Okay.
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH] 
L:  And how would you go about doing that?
R:  I suppose the first thing I'd need is a storefront or someplace, so that people could call -- though probably also a web page on the Internet, so that people could locate me to ask me their questions.
L:  Okay.   
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH] And what kind of business would you start?
L:  Um, I would probably, um, ah -- well, I'm studying to be a speech pathologist, so I would probably open my own office, um --
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH]
L:  -- possibly specializing, um, um, particularly with children with autism, um, since I'm doing that already.  So, um, I would probably, um, find a couple of business partners because I don't think I'm a --
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH]
L:  -- um, very good in terms of business and bookkeeping --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and things like that -- that I would, um, want some people to [NOISE], um, join with me in that.  So ...
R:  Would you bring on fellow pathologists, or would you bring on a staff that knew how to run an office for you?
L:  Um, I would probably bring, um, some people -- some other speech pathologists, but, um, [SIGH] [MN], um, I think it would be interesting if I could bring along, um, like, um, an occupational therapist --
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH]
L:  -- and a physical therapist and, um, somebody -- like a special educator, um, maybe a nurse.  Just a -- like we would have our own clinic, but --
R:  You'd bring on a full fledged clinic?
L:  Right, yeah.  So...
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH] [COUGH] Um, in setting up the business like that, how much paper work do you think is involved?  Like, would you have to have special permits?
L:  Um, we- -- I think we would --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- all have to make sure that we --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- have, um --
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH]
L:  -- that our licensing would be, um, acceptable -- like if -- if we went to another state -- if we all got licensed in the state of Wisconsin, that we would make sure that we were licensed in whatever state we were in -- um, that we were all [NOISE] -- we passed all those --
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH]
L:  -- standards.  Um, [NOISE] and, um, [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't, um --
R:  I don't know -- is a speech pathologist closer to being a doctor, or closer to being like a therapist or something like that?
L:  Like a therapist.  Um, it would be working -- I would prefer we work with children, but, um, working with --
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH]
L:  -- people who have speech and language problems, whether it's a problem um, with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the voice -- if, um, you know, if there was a singer who, um, [LIPSMACK] did some damage to their vocal folds and, um, need to recover from that, or if it's a child that can't produce a certain sound [NOISE].  Something like that. [NOISE]
R:  [COUGH] Hm.  Interesting.  I hadn't thought of the singer seeing a speech pathologist before though.  I guess that makes sense.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um.
L:  Would you want to -- to be in your business by yourself?
R:  Um, I suppose I'd like other partners, but I imagine it would be a research generalist[?] kind --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of thing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I m- --
L:  Okay.
R:  I remember years ago reading in a book about a guy who set up shop as a bibliographer near a university, so that sp- -- he made his living on student end term papers coming up.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they would come and ask him, "What sources can I use?" or, "I'm having trouble getting this source, is there any way to track it down?"
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I -- I've been in grad school for quite a while and I know how to do that.  Much better than writing a thesis, I've found. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So  [COUGH]
L:  Well, I imagine that would be helpful.  Do you have something like that in place at the university that you're attending?
R:  Um, no there really isn't much of anything like that, other than harassing the research librarians.
L:  Okay.  Um --
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH]
L:  We have something --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- here, um, that -- it's called the Children's Cooperative Book Center, or something.  And it's like that, but it's for, um, educators who, um, want -- it- it's a resource center that, um, educators -- if they want to teach about a certain subject, um, [NOISE] or want to research a certain topic for teaching their class they can call this --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, this number and these librarians gather all these materials and call them back with it.  Um. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I think that would be very helpful, um, for students or for just people doing research for +theses or, you know, things like that.  I think that would be -- that'd be very helpful.
R:  Do they do the actual research, or do they tend more to, um, [LIPSMACK] simply suggest resources? [SIGH]
L:  Um, both, I think.  If -- if you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- want, um -- if there's like a book or something that you would like to use in your classroom and it's controversial or something like that, these people will do research on it and find, um, things that other people have said about this book or -- whether it's from the author or from other educators that have used it, or, um, you know, school board rulings -- things like that.  They can provide you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with that also.
R:  Ah, interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  How much would you expect to be paid for something like that?
R:  Um, I suppose it would depend on the request and the number of hours of research.  Um, I don't think, in the Internet age, twenty dollars an hour is unreasonable simply because so many things can be found in half an hour if you know how to work search engines and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] databases.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, not like in the book I was reading where the guy had a great big room full of notepads [LAUGH] because the computer, at the time, was just, um, kind of like those Atari sixty fours. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my!
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH] It's an old book. [MN]
L:  Um.
R:  Um.
L:  Is that something that you would seriously consider though, that -- I mean, or is this just like a hypothetical thing?  Or this something that you would actually like to do?
R:  Probably as a sideline to a tutoring business or something like that, I'd consider it. 
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um.
R:  Yeah, or --
L:  Pardon me?
R:  [MN] Before[?] setting up your own speech pathology lab -- would you rather set up your own, or would you rather work within an institutional framework?
L:  I would rather work in an institution, um, simply because, just starting out, I would like to have a support system around me and to get some experience -- working in a school or hospital setting where I have --
R:  With other --
L:  -- an idea --
R:  -- people who have leant the hard lessons. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, Also I --
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  So I can learn from the people around me and see what works and what doesn't work.  And that I can learn from those -- the success stories and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, mistakes that have been made, um, that I -- would help me when I would open my own business.  Um --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  So --
R:  So would you see opening your own business as a longer term goal, or as something --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- more to do with --
L:  I would actually rather, um -- right now, my plan is to be in a school setting, um -- but, it would be nice one day if I had the chance to go back to school.  And I would like to get my PhD before I --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- started my own business.  Um, just to have that [NOISE], um, in my pocket, but, um --
R:  So you can be your own expert? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Um, but most of the people that I know that have gotten PhDs for speech language pathology, um, do research and that's really not something that I'm interested in.  I'm more interested in clinical work -- working with people.  So, [SIGH], um, basic- --
R:  No, I understand that.  I'm working on a doctorate in French literature and would rather teach people to speak French than make the next big discovery about some author who's been dead a hundred years, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  That's how I feel.  I like people. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] [COUGH]
L:  Um, do you know of any people right now that if -- if you could open this business right now that you would consider partnering up with?
R:  I have a handful of people that I've worked with off and on over the years.  The hard part would be convincing them to give up their +lucrative jobs that they have now. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, that would be kind of a 
R:  Not everybody's still in grad school. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] [MN] [COUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, how long have you been studying speech pathology?
L:  Um, I'm a senior and doing my -- I'm finishing on my under grad right now.  And, um, so I'm actually sending out letters for grad school now.  So, I haven't started, um, [LIPSMACK] the -- like my clinical rotation are[?] done.  One, um, clinical [SIGH], um, experience in a school where I worked with, um, one child for a half an hour.  And, um, I worked with him on two speech sounds that he could not produce.  And --
R:  [COUGH] [COUGH]
L:  -- um, I did that for a semester and I really enjoyed it.  So, um, I think I would rather be in a school than start my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- own business.  Um --
R:  Now, as a foreign language teacher I have one sideline for [LAUGH] you.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] Ah, we spend a lot of our time trying to teach people who are twenty years old to make brand new sounds. [LAUGH]  Because, like the French R -- it's not a thing that exists in English.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, I -- when I prepare, ah, course materials and things like that I frequently run into situations where I know that my students can't produce a sound --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and I don't know whether there would be any application for something like that --
L:  Well, um --
R:  -- A part that[?] people who wish to speak a foreign language perfectly understand. [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, um, people -- some people from, um -- that come to our university from other universities, um, especially, um, ones, um -- like foreign exchange students, they sometimes come to the clinic on campus, um, to have --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- um, accent reduction because they would like to --
