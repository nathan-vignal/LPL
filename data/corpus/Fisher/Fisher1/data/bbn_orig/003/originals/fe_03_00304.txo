L:  Hi, my name is Lindy Jones.
R:  Hi, my name is Leena.
L:  Hi, Leena.
R:  Um, hi.  Oh, you're a real person [LAUGH]
L:  I am.  [LAUGH] I guess the Fisher thing is [inaudible].  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about airport security?
R:  Um, yeah, so -- well, the question was ...?
L:  Um, do you think that airport security hei- -- or increases actual security when you're flying?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, I -- I was -- I wonder if -- like, sort of, um [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I sort of think that it -- if somebody's like actually determined to do something, they'll do it anyway --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's my general idea of this, but that might just be cynical [LAUGH].  Um, what about you, what do you think?
L:  You know, at first I thought, because at first it seemed to me like they were definitely profiling people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like last summer and -- and even a year ago, like last winter, it seemed like when I'd see them pulling people out it was always, like, some Middle Eastern or some --
R:  Right, right, yeah, definitely.
L:  -- and I was -- and so then it seemed like any time there's a consistent system, like you said, if people are determined to do something, they're going to figure out the system and they're going to get around it and if it's like obvious profiling, then --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, just go dressed like, whoever they're not profiling.  Um, but now it seems like they're a little better at being random.  Like I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- definitely have more faith in it now.
R:  I feel like -- well, I first thought that it was going to be only a US thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I was surprised, um, the last time I flew, actually, I was, um, coming back from -- from Madrid --
L:  Oh, how cool.
R:  -- yeah, and I was, um, in my -- there were like these two guys on the way into the plane, um, just like after we had checked our baggage and everything, just checking carry on stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was -- and they were all, you know, dressed up in military attire, like they pulled out my friend and I had to wait for her and stuff and it was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so weird because I was like, I thought this crazy, scary, whatever, stuff it was still -- it was only in the US.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, yeah, I -- I don't know, I really like don't know if they're still, um, racially profiling as much as they were, but, um, I was actually very concerned when I heard, um, I think it was over the summer, when they started some sort of like really, really tight immigration law --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and visit- -- visitation law, actually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where people from certain countries were not allowed, like, were going to be checked up on while they're in the US and that looked to me, it was just, you know, brothers -- Big Brother, whatever.  So ...
L:  So, yeah, I guess the --
R:  -- that's a little scary.
L:  -- the question they didn't ask that I think is real important is, like, um, what about the trade off?  Like between the heightened security, maybe it does, maybe it doesn't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- actually improve security, but, like, is it worth it?
R:  Well, I think i- -- I think in a lot of, um, to a lot of people it is worth it because I mean they obviously don't -- and this sort of incident doesn't happen in statistic -- like, it's much easier to get in a car accident, everybody like sort of knows that, but not really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I mean, no matter what
