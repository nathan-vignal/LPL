L:  Hi.  My name is Suzanne.  I'm calling from Portland, Oregon.
R:  [NOISE] Hello.  My name is Scoon[?], and I'm in San Francisco, California. 
L:  Oh, hi.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Good thanks.  How are you doing?
L:  Well, it's raining here in Portland, as usual.  So, um the topic?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I guess it's pretty timely 'cause -- at least here there's this huge, um, peace protest kind of thing going on this weekend.
R:  Which one is it that you --
L:  I think that's happening at there too.
R:  That's -- you're saying it's timely, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel that, ah, the -- not only the question about the role of the United States in the peace process, but, um, the larger question -- will there ever be peace is, um --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- one that's been ongoing my entire life.  And it's a -- um, although I do feel that there will eventually be peace, I don't think it's going to be any time soon.  And I don't think that the United States has the power or impartiality to effect it. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, a lot of that has to do, I think, with economic reasons because, you know, there's so much economic stake, I think, on American companies, I guess, in the Middle East.
R:  Um, yeah.  There is.  You're right.
L:  'Cause --
R:  Not on- 
L:  I don't think -- if it's, say North Korea.  I mean --
R:  Right, you have t-
L:  North Korea has no resources like oil.  So, it's -- it's like back burner, you know?
R:  They had this, um -- and even though the Unites States is trying to calm down North Korea with, ah, an economic stimulus package, um -- g-
L:  I -- I heard about that.
R:  They're, um.  You're -- you're quite right.  There are a lot of, um, valuable resources in the Middle East and American companies certainly have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of, um, [LIPSMACK] a lot of reasons to remain very involved [NOISE] --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- there. [NOISE] But, ah --
L:  But, of course people are starving both in Iraq and North Korea.  I mean, for a decade really.
R:  Oh, yeah.  And I mean --
L:  But they are treated differently.
R:  Well, I -- I d- I -- I don't have a lot of faith in the United States to, um, bring peace, mostly because I --
L:  No.
R:  -- think the -- the, um, world community no longer sees the United --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- States as, um, an effective, ah, arbitrator.  And, um, thinks -- and I was travelling in Europe recently and a lot of the editorials in the newspapers, you know, focused on whether or not the United States was being fair in its dealings with various parties.  And the consensus was that, no the United States was not being fair.  And I -- I was kind of surprised to read that because, ah, having been in the United States for such a long time, I --
L:  Yeah.  I think people are losing faith, I guess, you know.  And I guess also that, ah, you really have to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- impartial --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be somebody who can be a peacemaker.
R:  That's also true, yeah.
L:  And --
R:  And what --
L:  Obviously we are not really impartial now. [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  But I think it is important --
L:  We're siding with somebody.
R:  It is important to command respect, ah, amongst various parties if one is to bring about peace or any sort of meaningful dialogue.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, [SIGH] ah, I -- I think that role belongs more to the UN than to the US.
L:  Right.
R:  And either the UN is, um, perceived as perhaps more slow and methodical and, ah --
L:  Yeah, it's more deliberate, even when it's not still -- you know, it's not bar three[?].
R:  [LIPSMACK] And --
L:  If you come to think about how it operates, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where it's coming from historically. [PAUSE]
R:  Well, do you feel that there will be peace in the Middle East?
L:  [PAUSE] Well, I think as long as they [COUGH] [MN] -- they are willing to, I guess, accept differences.  You know, like, religious differences.  Some of them obviously -- economic differences, and all that[?].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it seems like they're a little bit more [PAUSE] inflexible, I guess, you know. [NOISE]  Because --
R:  In what resp-
L:  -- a lot of what they believe is really what they call, you know, God's will -- whatever. [PAUSE]  So, it's like agree them or it just -- there could be -- there will be some kind of holy war or whatever, you know.  And it seems like that doesn't happen here in the western world that much, 'cause like it's --
R:  No.  Here it's agree with us or it will be a -- George Bush's war.
L:  [LAUGH] True, yeah.  But, at least --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we have at least more room for pluralism, I guess.  You know, the right to disagree, I guess.
R:  Did you say that there was a, um, big --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, peace demonstration in Portland? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I heard it's going to be, like the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:   -- world wide events. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I think there's --
L:  This Saturday.
R:  I remember -- yes.  That's right.  Um, the eighteenth, I think?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  There's certainly --
L:  Yeah, Portland has a big -- events like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that all the time.
R:  Well, there's going to be a big rally here in San Francisco as well.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE] [COUGH]
R:  I -- I -- I am worried that the United States will, um, act precipitously in --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- the Middle East.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And with the continuing build up of troops around the Persian Gulf that --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- it may trigger something bad.  I'm not sure what.  But either something harmful in that area -- perhaps repercussions in another part of the world.  And --
L:  And this time it seems like, you know, we're acting alone.  You know, it's like maybe Britain is supportive, but n- nobody else.
R:  Well, Britain has been a very strong ally of the United States in, um -- since the, ah, Gulf War --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- way back ten years ago. [NOISE]  And it's in that area the two countries have been working very assiduously together to, ah, ensure that Iraq doesn't overstep the bounds of the, ah, UN disarmament that was put together in ninety one.  But, it would be nice if there were more --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- international support, especially in Europe --
L:  Mm.
R:   -- where so many of our traditional allies are.  But, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- one -- one reads in the newspaper that Turkey and Saudi Arabia are both hesitating to, ah, share military bases with the United States.  But, certainly it makes me pause and con- and reconsider whether, um, [LIPSMACK] our country's doing the right thing. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, if[?] -- Turkey has also been a very strong ally of the United States in military operations in that area.
L:  Right.
R:  And the United States was really pulling -- it was counting on Turkey to support us, ah, in any operations we'd have in Iraq.  So, it -- it -- it's been making me think a lot about whether we're taking the right steps. [PAUSE].
L:  Well, hopefully this isn't a step, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to the US to separate itself --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from the world.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -s a lot of countries in history have got into the war like that. [NOISE]  Like how Japan went into, um, World War Two. [COUGH]  
R:  That's a very --
L:  Nineteen forties --
R:  -- good example.
L:  -- by isolating themselves.
R:  I think it might be very difficult for the United States to actually isolate itself, because, ah, we're so tied up in trade with every nation.  And --
L:  Ay.
R:  Even if one or two countries, like Turkey, decide that they want to separate themselves, they're still --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- very dependent upon the United States --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for so many things, least of which is, ah, economic.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or perhaps I should say, "Not least of which is economic".
L:  Maybe all these things boils down to money though.
R:  [NOISE] You think --
L:  After all[?] --
R:  -- it's a -- money -- not -- not as much a issue as religion?
L:  Ay.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause if the religion is the issue, then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Saudi Arabia, for instance, which is a very strong fundamental Is- Islamic nation.  Yet, they haven't really been attacked by the US, for instance, you know.
R:  That's true.
