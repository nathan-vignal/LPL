R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.  Hi, how are you? [SIGH]
R:  Pretty good.  My name's Abby.
L:  Hi, Abby.  My name is Sheryl.
R:  Hi Sheryl.  [SIGH] So, what type of business would you open? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I would probably open a business that would involve, um, like, ah, custom tailoring and sewing.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm an avid sewer and, ah, although it's not what I do for, um, [LIPSMACK] for a career right now, it's an interest of mine.  I'd love to turn that into a business.  What about you?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I wouldn't be sewing. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I -- I -- I've had a few, um, small businesses before.  I did some freelance, ah, bookkeeping, and that was a -- wasn't a store front business.  I went from business to business.  And that was pretty satisfying.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my brother owned a restaurant and I worked with him for a while, and ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I might do that again, but that has really bad hours.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Um, any business that I would open, I'd -- I mean, ideally I'd like to most of the work from home.  [SIGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, um, some of the work, um, I'd like to have a website associated with it.  And this way I could do lots of, um, kind of, um, marketing, but, um, without a whole lot of effort --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um -- I've seen some businesses that, ah -- that seem to be successful, um, in that line.  And --
R:  Yeah, you've -- wouldn't have to have too much overhead either it sounded -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would sound like, because you could -- might do just customer order things to begin with.
L:  Right.  And, you know, I could, um, create something, take a digital picture of it, put it on the web, um, and then show it and explain it.  I've done lots of sewing.  Most -- most of the sewing I've done -- um, I like creating, um, you know, the -- the soft sculpture bunnies and animals, and dress them in period costumes.  And, um, I've had a lot of, um -- rather rec- -- good reception --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as far as -- from different folks.  They'd say, "Oh, you ought to start a business and sell these".  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, 'cause I just do it for family and friends.  You know, for birthdays, holidays --
R:  Mhm.  [SIGH] 
L:  But, if I -- but if I didn't have, um, ah, a regular job I would love to start a business that would involve as least something that I was interested in, um, from a hobby perspective.
R:  Yeah, that kind of sewing -- if you did that -- that product, the nice thing about is that it doesn't have to fit, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- having to, um, tailor it to somebody and have it be not quite right, and then you'd have lost that investment.
L:  Right, right.  And this would simply be -- someone would be able to see -- see the item -- say, um, maybe a little bit of history, um.  I love to write a little and I could write a little history of, um -- some of the, um -- some of the items that I have made, um -- I made a bunny and dressed her in like, um -- she was dressed as Lara from Doctor Zhivago.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  You know, and then another bunny I made for my mother, she was dressed in a Victorian costume that -- I kind of looked in -- at some period costumes and then came up with one that I could fashion.  And --
R:  You just designed them yourself?
L:  Yeah, I designed them myself.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, so I was -- you know, I was thinking this'd be great if I could do this. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, something that interests me.  Something that I could do at my own time, um, and yet do, like, on a contract basis.  You know, someone would want something specific --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I could, you know, design it and then see if it would meet a client's expectations, and --
R:  And you wouldn't -- would you consider doing things like craft fairs, if you got --
L:  Well --
R:  -- extra made up ahead?
L:  -- you know, no because so many people do them, and lots of craft fairs items are, um -- they're -- they're not that expensive.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anywhere from five to twenty dollars for an item.  And the -- the things that I have fashioned, you know, usually take me a full thirty hours to, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to create and then sell.  And, um, you know, that's almost like a week's worth of work and I couldn't sell it for twenty [LAUGH] dollars.
R:  [LAUGH] Nope.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, and of course, you know, I -- um, I'd -- I have to do lots of research about wha- you know, mm -- if I was going to got that way there are some -- some juried[?] art shows and some craft fairs, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:   -- um, that might support something like that.  Um, but, they're d- they're in different parts of the country so I'd have to do some, um, demographic analysis first.  Um, um, creating the website isn't a problem.  I'm involved in a comp- computer industry anyway, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I've kind of, you know, toyed with the idea.  It's, um -- it seems feasible, um.  But, of course starting any new business involves a -- a great deal of, um -- a great deal of effort in the beginning -- [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, to get a business going.  And then, um, you need to actually make it, um -- make it so -- you know, so that you have an income that would support, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- support my efforts.
R:  It sounds like it's one that you could start [SIGH] with, um, still keeping your current job, um, if you would -- if you knew that some time was coming up, or you could devote extra time to it to get it off the ground.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And then slowly wean yourself off of your other job and ...
L:  Right.  And I'm so risk averse, I would have to do that, you know.  I couldn't --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- like [LAUGH] -- you know, you can't just jump into it and say, "Okay, I'm going to try this now and see if it works".  So --
R:  I'll quit my job.  Ah. 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's not within the realm of -- of, you know, reality.  So --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, yeah I would do it concurrently and then see, um -- oh well, does it, you know -- is it -- is it going to work?  Is it, ah -- is it something I could really devote, you know, full time to and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- would support me?  I mean, you know, lots of things go into that.  Yeah, I'd -- and that's what would make it hard because you'd still be working.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Doing the two at once for a while would be hard.
L:  Yeah, it sure would be.  So, there's lots of considerations go into that.  [LIPSMACK] What about you?
R:  Well, I -- I did like when I did the, um, [LIPSMACK] freelance bookkeeping.  And that really started with, um, helping out one person who was a mechanic, who -- his business kept getting bigger and bigger and he needed somebody to help out.  And I would just [SIGH] go to his business and, um, work a few hours there, and then also take some home. And I did his quarterly taxes and his, um, payroll and things like that.  And then I got another client -- word of mouth.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that was pretty satisfying 'cause I like that, um -- I like making things, ah, balance.  And I like, ah, the mathematics of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Is that associated with your current position?
R:  No.  [MN] Right now I, um -- [LIPSMACK] I'm bet- I'm in construction. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R: Whole different field, so, um -- but it's nice to do -- the bookkeeping was nice because I got to, ah, set my own hours --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and accept clients that I wanted.  And, um, it was busy at certain times of the year, when quarterly taxes were da- due and payroll --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and things like that.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --I loved being able to create my own hours and have extra time to do other things, so --
L:  So, wouldn't -- isn't that, you know -- that's always, I think, an ideal, you know, to be able to have extra time to do those things that we would like to do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, instead of reporting to work to do something that is merely a job --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.  And I think that if it's your own business you're going to put in more time --
L:  Yeah, um, and --
R:  -- to be successful.
L:  Yeah, and from -- from other folks that I have known, who have started their own business, there is a lot of time involved in starting up.  And, um, there's lots of free courses to, um -- I'm also a -- a college student -- a graduate student, and, um -- lots of business courses, you know, how to start your --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- own small business.  And also small business administration.  So, there's lots of -- I -- I know there's information that would be easy to tap into, um.  And also, I've an undergraduate business degree, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I could probably put that to use, yea- [LAUGH] -- you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  At this point it sounds like you could.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You just have to --
L:  And, ah -- I don't know though, um.  It's -- it's a scary thing to, you know -- I also hear of scary stories from folks who'd say, "Oh I couldn't, you know -- I couldn't imagine how much work that's really involved in having your own business or I'd have never gone into it.  It's so much easier just to work for someone else.  And get up --"
R:  Mm.
L:  -- report to work, come home, and then leave it behind you".  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And then, um, you know, sole proprietors, you know, tend not to have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You don't have that luxury of leaving the business behind.
R:  Yeah.  They don't have vacation times, and insurance, and all the things that you get with a regular job.
L:  Right.  You take it home with them.  And, um, I've, um, been involved in a -- a residential remodelling.  We -- former husband and I had a small business and I did the bookkeeping for him.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I know what you're talking about as far as, you know, quarterly taxes, so --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And that kind of bookkeeping that goes along with the construction industry, so -- lots of tedious work --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- to do.
R:  I guess you have to figure out, um -- when you think it -- when you were mentioning those people that said they'd much rather work for a regular pay check, I guess you have to figure out your own personality and figure out what's more satisfying to you, the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- risk that comes with not having that guaranteed paycheck, and little bit less flexibility.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, versus the other side.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I don't know, I think as we get older, we -- maybe we're a bit more willing to take some of those risks.  Because, spending years in the work force, you know, you kind of begin to dream about, "Oh wouldn't it be nice --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to have -- to work for myself --
R: [LAUGH] 
L:  -- instead of someone --
R:  Absolutely.
L: -- else?"
