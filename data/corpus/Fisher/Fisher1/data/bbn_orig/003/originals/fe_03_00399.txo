R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Anybody there?
L:  Yeah.  Hi, I'm Dechan[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Lynne. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi.  Ah, so we are talking about computers in --
R:  Apparently --
L:  -- education.
R:  -- computers in education, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, what do you think about it?
R:  You don't know anything about it?
L:  Ah, computers are today a part of life.  They can't [NOISE] be separated.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I think --
L:  And, ah --
R:  -- they're gonna -- they're gonna be everywhere.
L:  Yeah.  And education is obviously a area where computer has to be first.  And, ah, students, ah, they are the first p- people to learn them, because the future is going to be computers. [NOISE]  More and more of computers -- everything.  So --
R:  Well, that and I think they're a good learning tool.  I think a lot of kids respond well to it.  They -- they see them as a toy and they -- they're gonna learn despite themselves because they, um -- they're getting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to play.  You know?
L:  Right.
R:  And every kid learns differently.  Not everybody responds to the same [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- learning tools.
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.  Did you have --
L:  And the computer --
R:  -- computers?
L:  Nowadays they are designed to be [NOISE] in such a way that, ah, kids are attracted to them.
R:  Oh yeah.  Well, they make noise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're colorful.  They, you know -- they -- even the little kids have got the soft pads.
L:  Right.
R:  The, um -- the soft key- -- you know, keypads --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where they can start learning off really early.  So, yeah, I'm -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] I don't think you can separate the two anymore.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's right.
R:  Did you have computers when you were in school?
L:  Yeah, I did.
R:  Yeah?  
L:  Ah --
R:  How -- how old are you?
L:  I am thirty four right now.
R:  Yeah, see, you're young. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, see, I didn't.  I mean, I was, um -- I was, um, out in the work field years and years and years before computers were introduced.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so, it -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I think it's a -- they're a major influence.  I think everybody needs to know as much as they can about it.
L:  Yeah.  And definitely when I was in my school I was in about sixth grade --   
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- and I was very, very, very excited to see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a computer.
R:  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and that was the first time -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I saw the computer in front of me.
R:  Oh, I was --
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, I was probably forty, and I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- was excited.  You know? [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I was just tickled to death because, you know -- and, um, now I see a lot of my friends, my age and a little older, retiring because they're too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- afraid of the computer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [MN] the -- the next generation of kids won't be doing that because they won't be afraid --
L:  [MN] Yeah.  They will be very much fear- -- fearing for[?] the computer.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they -- they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  They know so much more about it.  And if you --   
L:  Right.
R:  -- start too late then people are fearful.  They sit -- they sit there waiting -- not to push a button because they're afraid they're gonna do something wrong.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Yeah.  So, no, I think -- I think they're -- the more they use them the better they are.  Plus you -- you get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- graphics and stuff.  I mean, they've got the Discovery stuff that they see on their computers where --
L:  Yeah, everything. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  Everything.
R:  -- entertaining.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the whole -- you can see the whole encyclopedia on a small disc, right?
R:  Isn't that amazing?
L:  Yeah.  It -- it used to be a big, ah, thick book, ah, which, you know[?], kids couldn't handle, ah, those things.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- this is now just a click of a button.
R:  Yeah.  See, I love that stuff.
L:  Yeah.  And the things are kind of -- they can watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- videos, they can watch multi media, sound.  They can learn faster in fact, with a computer, rather than a book.
R:  Oh, yeah. I think you're right.  And, you know, I hadn't even thought of the computer stuff.  That apparently is just gone +exponential --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of what they can do on the computer with music.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I think that's fabulous.  And I --
L:  Yeah, that's right.  
R:  -- hadn't even considered that, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.  I mean, I just -- I -- I don't think they can get away.  I think the downside is so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- minimal compared to the upside.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  There is downside, but, ah, the other [several inaudible words] side of things, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you have to accept them. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but one thing is for sure -- that computers are a part of education now.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And bu- -- and really the downside is just that the kids can get into sites where maybe they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- don't need to be.
L:  Right.
R:  If they're not age appropriate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  But, right now we get softwares, ah -- they can use setting controls, anyway[?].
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  So, we can control that to -- to --
R:  And I --
L:  -- some extent.
R:  I would assume that the -- all the school systems have those controls.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  They do.
R:  I don't -- I don't know that, but I would assume that that would have to be a norm where they -- they screen them out.
L:  Right.
R:  If you seen that com -- -- that commercial with the MSN where the butterfly keeps moving in front of the -- the billboard and all the -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- things she doesn't want the kids to see.  I think that's pretty cute.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm all for it.  I think that the more we can offer kids, [NOISE] the younger we can offer it, the better they'll do.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause otherwise they learn to be old too fast.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And that's gonna happen fast enough, I'll tell ya. [COUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Have you done --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- this survey before?
L:  Ah, no I have not done this survey.  This is the first time.
R:  Oh, me too.  So, they'll see we're both novices.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Ah, I'm not --
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  -- sure how in depth they expect us to go.  I mean, I --
L:  Even I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause, um, my field --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is nursing, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I don't know a whole lot about education.
L:  In fact, I am a engineering major, so [LAUGH] --
R:  If -- you're what major?
L:  Engineering.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Electrical engineering.
R:  Very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you're going to know a lot about it by the time you're done.
L:  Hm, yeah.
R:  Are you through school?
L:  Yeah.  I am a grad student right now.
R:  Very good.
L:  Yeah.  That is --
R:  And so what --
L:  I guess that must be it.
R:  Now, did you use a lot of it when -- you know, you said you got -- you got it in elementary school, but did you use a lot of computers, like, for your engineering degree?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  Once I got into this engineering stream --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I started using computers a lot.  In fact, ah, daily, you can say.
R:  Now, do -- do you, like, sketch out, um -- I mean, what -- what kind of engineer are you?
L:  Every, ah, plan of -- I do programming. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do, ah, circuit designing.
R:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking -- was circuits.  So, do you do that kind of thing on a computer?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.  But, that's gotta --
L:  Then the simulation of different things.  There are a whole lot of things you can do. And since the computers are so powerful today --
R:  Oh, that is +fabulous.
L:  -- you can just imagine what they could do. 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that would just be fabulous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Great, yeah.  'Cause I mean, most of the stuff that I use for computers is, um, word processing, or, um, oh -- you know, when I was working I, um, could design forms that were -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- specific to my work area.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that type of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but, yeah to get to be able to use whole packages and to design packages like you do, I mean, that's fabulous.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Way to go.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, I can't think of anything else right now.
R:  No.  I think I've [MN] -- I mean, unless they expect us to be smarter than this, I think I've about exhausted what I think about it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I appreciate talking to ya.
L:  Sure.  I do too.
R:  Oh, okay.  May talk to you again.  Who knows?
L:  Sure.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay, bye bye.
R:  Bye bye now.
