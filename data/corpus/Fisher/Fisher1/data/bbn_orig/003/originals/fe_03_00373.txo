L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yes, ah this is Ali
R:  Ah, what did you say?

R:  Oh, Ali.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is Teresa. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  And, ah, you have any idea of this topic?
L:  Ah, what is the topic again?
R:  Oh, it was, um, what do we feel about the recent strike of the professional +athletes.
L:  Okay.  Um, I don't know -- I guess it's pretty -- I guess it's okay.  I guess they're trying to, you know, generate interest about their sport by, like, striking and, you know, to get more attention [NOISE] or something like that.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  But, I haven't really been following the news or whatever.  But, ah, you know, I can feel that I got -- you know, if they're striking and if they're kind of, ah, not -- not satisfied about something, I guess, you know -- if the fans not, ah, coming to the games [NOISE] or, you know, something like that.  [PAUSE]  [NOISE] How do you feel?   
R:  Um, I don't really watch sports news, so I don't know anything about it.
L:  Yeah.  Me too, so that's kind of tough.  But I used to play sport, so I can, you know -- I think I heard briefly maybe they were striking because they had to use their salary to pay back something and they feel that, you know -- they don't want to, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [several inaudible words] get rid of one or two, but ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, um --
R:  How long ago was this?
L:  How long ago was it?  Um, I don't know.  Like, I think I heard it maybe about a week or two ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  Like, I don't --
R:  So, it's not too long ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought, um, like, m- maybe a month ago I heard something like that too.
L:  Did you?  I don't know.  What other topics do they have to talk about?  I mean [MN] --I don't really watch sports or too much TV that much.
R:  Oh.  Do, um -- do we need to talk for [SIGH] a specific time?
L:  Hm, I don't know actually. [LAUGH]  [several inaudible words] see what.  I guess, um -- does the guy come back on there, and he's like, "The next question of the day is this" or   Yeah, I don't know, uh.
R:  Is this your first time getting a call?
L:  Yeah.  You know -- have you -- what about you?
R:  Um, yesterday I got five calls.  But, yesterday I went to sleep e- early.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Like, I was so sleepy and I couldn't answer the phone, so ... [SIGH]
L:  Mm.  I got, like, five --  
R:  I pick up the phone and, ah, um -- because I signed up for -- at least a week ago -- I mean, probably two weeks ago.
L:  Yeah.  Mm.
R:  And, so -- and I didn't get any calls during these -- um, the past two weeks, so I thought maybe, ah, it was just a joke or something. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, me too, at first.  But, then yesterday they kept calling and calling, like, back to back to back to back.  And I put the password in for it, but nothing really happened.  So, I was, like, "Forget it".  You know, and then, um, somebody was around me, and I was, like -- I didn't really want to, you know -- anybody to know I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just talking to [LAUGH] -- just talking to the um   Whatever it was it was, like, got -- the answering machine got it, and it was like, "Put your code in".  So, I did, but then I was, like, "Well, see, if there's anybody around me".  You know, I don't want them to be all -- you know, it was just like weird or crazy or whatever, so I stopped answering the phone.  But, um, yeah, ah -- what are they studying on? [MN] It's like, you know, how people can talk just off nothing and whatever.
R:  Um, so are you a Penn student?
L:  No.  Um, I go to school in Atlanta.  Um, it's a advertising school called the Portfolio Center.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  And, like, we got a email -- like, a lot of the students was, like, "Um, talk on the phone for a couple minutes -- ten dollars.  And they're just doing a study for, like, a focus group type thing" -- I don't know.  Are you -- are you -- so, ah, I guess a Penn, um, student too?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Um, yes I saw an email too.
L:  Yeah.  What do you -- I mean -- what do you study there?

R:  Well, I saw the email +said it's a study for how people talk to strangers or something like that.
L:  True?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, it's easier to talk to strangers on the phone than it is to -- I mean, you really couldn't just -- say if you see me, like, on the street or wherever, you wouldn't just start talking.  You know what I mean?  Easy is -- like, talking on the phone is almost like talking on a chat line, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, you don't really see the person or anything, but I don't --
R:  Yeah.  It's much easier.  So, h- --

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, most of the people that go there have, like, four year, um, degrees.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
