L:  Hi.
R:  Oh, good evening.  Ah, this is John Webb speaking.  I'm from Dayton, Ohio.
L:  Hi.  I'm Angie Paul.  I'm from, um, Athens, Georgia.
R:  Athens, Georgia.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's an interesting question they're posing for us.
L:  [NOISE]  It is.  I'm not s- -- I don't know.  Normally I would say no because I don't, you know, [inaudible] but, if it was for, like, my daughter or a close relative, I -- I don't know, I might be persuaded.  If that would like keep them out of trouble.
R:  Yeah, it's -- that's a -- it is a difficult question.  The, ah, ah, the thing, ah, there's a couple of things involved of course, ah, perjury's a very serious, ah, offence --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, if you -- if you had good intentions to try to help someone out in your family or a good friend, ah, and you did, ah, commit perjury and, ah, you were caught at it, you wouldn't help their situation any, so --
L:  That's true.  And I guess you'd end up in jail too [LAUGH].
R:  So, ah, I -- I don't know.  Ah.
L:  I don't know.  I'm not sure if they -- I don't know what they do about perjury now, I don't know if you go to jail or if they fine you, or what.  I'm not sure.
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm sure it would depend on the, ah, you know, it would depend on the, ah, the nature of the, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the offence, ah --
L:  That's true.  Or the severity of it, yeah.
R:  Right.  How severe it was.  Um, it, ah, I- -- I don't -- I don't have any idea what the, ah, penalty for perjury is, ah -- whe- -- whether that's, ah, whether that's different State by State, or, ah, whether --
L:  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  It probably is.  But normally I would -- I would never do that, but, ah, I don't know.  I really think if it was for like my child [LAUGH] I'm -- I might if it would keep him, I don't know, out of trouble.  But, then again, I guess if you -- you're not helping anybody to -- if they've committed a crime, maybe they, you know, you shouldn't lie for them because they should [SIGH] uh, not do that or pay for it or learn their lesson or something.
R:  You know, there might -- there might be better ways to help them.  That's, ah --
L:  That's true.
R:  There mi- -- there might be some alternative, ah, ways that were -- th- -- that might help them better than, ah, than like --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- committing perjury.
L:  That --
R:  Because, ah, I've, ah, ah, I was on a, ah, a grand jury for about four months here in Ohio and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- th- --this is a very tension, ah, type of thing when you -- when you are a witness, ah, in a, ah, in a criminal, ah, ah, trial --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and, ah, I -- I think, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know how many people, even if they intended to commit perjury, I don't know how many people could actually carry it off.
L:  Well, that's true.  Without getting caught, yeah.
R:  Right.  Because, ah, the- -- these, ah, you know, these lawyers are, ah, you know, they -- they have, ah, they can a- -- approach something from five different directions and --
L:  Well, you're right.  And they can get a lot out of you [LAUGH].
R:  -- you could end -- you could end up, ah, sticking your foot in your mouth, ah --
L:  That's true.
R:  [inaudible] for certain.
L:  Yeah, but you'd have to be real good at lying, I guess.
R:  Right.  And I -- I don't --
L:  To get away with it.
R:  -- know how many people are that, ah, that proficient at --
L:  Yeah, I don't think too many [LAUGH] [NOISE] yeah.  Well, it was really nice talking to you.  This is a very interesting study.
R:  Right.  Um, my son, ah, my son recommended it to me.  His company has done some business with this research, ah, firm and he assured me --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that it was, you know, on the up and up --
L:  Yeah, that's what my, um, I work at the University of Georgia and one of our professors who's a linguistics professor, um, recommended me for it, so, yeah.
R:  They had, ah, some trouble tonight with me, the, ah, ah, I was on the computer when I got -- I got called twice when I was on the computer --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I got called about forty five minutes ago and, ah, they couldn't, ah, get me established in contact, ah, there was a -- a woman who was trying to get on, she couldn't remember her, ah, pin number --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I could hear her talking, she was talking to someone else --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and she couldn't remember her pin number --
L:  Oh.  Goodness.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.  I saved my email when they sent me mine just so I could be sure I remembered it. [NOISE]
R:  That's, ah, well, I don't know whether --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- they give a signal or something when this is over, or ...?
L:  I don't think so.  I've done it one other time, I actually got connected, um, Saturday night --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- to someone and, um, we just finally, um, hung up because we had, you know, discussed it and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- didn't much else to say.  But, um, but it was really nice talking to you and maybe --
R:  Yeah, well, I spent, ah, I spent some time in Georgia --
L:  Oh.
R:  --our oldest daughter was born in, ah, ah Marietta --
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's not too far from us. 
R:  I always thought --
L:  That's about an hour and a half.
R:  You know, I was stationed there at Dobbins, ah --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- Air Force Base there by -- by, ah, by the Lockheed Plant there.
L:  Wow.  Well, that's interesting.
R:  That's been years and years ago.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah --
L:  Oh, good.  So, all your children are grown now?
R:  Yeah.  We have, ah, oh, yeah.  We have, ah, ah, we have three children.  Ah, one, ah, lives in Washington DC, the other one, ah, in, ah, the Columbus Ohio area.  We lived in Dayton, so that -- they're close by and then we, ah --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- our oldest daughter lives out in Phoenix Arizona.
L:  Wow, that's a long way.
R:  That's a long haul.  Right.  We've --
L:  Yeah.  That is.  I have one daughter, she's thirteen months old.  So --
R:  Thirteen months old?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Our oldest daughter was forty eight a couple of days ago.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] that -- and that's not months, either.
L:  So, do you have grandchildren?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Ah, we have five.
L:  Oh, wow, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, Christmas is fun.
R:  [several inaudible words]  Yeah, we still have -- we still have some good friends that live in Marietta.
L:  Oh.  Good.
R:  And, ah -- ah --
L:  Well, you'll have to root for the Bulldogs in the Sugarbowl.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's been nice talking to you.
L:  It's nice talking to you, too.  And you have a Merry Christmas.
R:  You -- you and your family as well.
L:  Okay.  Bye, bye.
R:  Bye.
