R:  Hi, I'm Gerry.
L:  Hi, my name is Natasha.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So [SIGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're supposed to talk about opening a business?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, what would you do?
R:  Um, maybe a club.
L:  Like a fitness club or something?
R:  No, like a night club.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Some place where it's lively, lots of people all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- always something going on.  What about you?
L:  Um, I don't know, um, I don't think I would open a business, but, um, sometimes I've thought about like having a bakery.
R:  [MN] Do you like to cook?
L:  Um, yeah, I used to more, I don't so much these days --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I haven't had time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, yeah.
R:  Maybe -- maybe a good business.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How would you keep it open?
L:  Um [LAUGH] well, I guess if you're going to have a bakery, you just have produce stuff that people --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- enjoy eating.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah.  Um, [NOISE] I don't know, I can't imagine really doing it, though.
R:  Nah.  N- -- if I had a club I would, I don't know, I guess it'd be [NOISE] in the city more exclusive --
L:  Mhm.  Like what city, or --
R:  Ah, New York City --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- oh, yes.  [LAUGH] I don't know.  And hm -- and where would you want to open your bakery any place special, or just like ...?
L:  No, I don't -- I don't know.  Um, I live in Arizona now, but it doesn't really matter --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um, I think, ah, I think that -- oh, sure, a club would be like, maybe some other type of business would be better [several inaudible words] [NOISE].
L:  What else would you do?
R:  Um, [NOISE] a movie store.
L:  Like a rental place?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that might be a good one.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, we have a really good one here near where we live that everybody likes and you can get just about anything there.
R:  [inaudible] watching a movie [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I thought of it.  But, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- one that, ah, one that could produce a lot of interest and not just be like the regular chains.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Maybe a clothing store [LAUGH] I have people naming -- naming options here.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  They also --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they also asked whether you think you would be a good business owner and I don't think I would be, so [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, I don't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- think I'd be great --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, you have to good people skills but also like need to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put business first all the time, so --
L:  Yeah.  And accounting skills and yeah and I guess --
R:  [several inaudible words] -- it'll be hard and a lot of work, but it could be a very -- it could be fun --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really profitable, really pay off well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It could also be very, like, not just in money ways, but it could be very, very rewarding.
L:  Yeah.  Um, some people think it would be a lot more fun to own your own business so you don't have to work for a boss --
R:  [LAUGH] That could get me into trouble.
L:  So --  [LAUGH]
R:  But that would be fun.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just like being a CEO.  CEO --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of your own bakery or club.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think when it comes down to it, um, I'd be too scared about not having a regular paycheck coming in.
R:  Yeah, it's a big risk.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd need to win the lottery first.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and if you win the lottery then there's not much point opening a business, I suppose.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Unless it's just for the fun of it.
R:  Ah [LAUGH] get other people to work for you.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Um, what else?
L:  Um [LAUGH] --
R:  What else do they say to talk about [NOISE]?
L:  I don't know, I think that was just about it on businesses.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.  What other kind of business could a person run?  Um, and something with computers, writing your own software or something, if you can do that kind of thing.
R:  I can't do that, but that would ac- -- that would be a good business --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pay off pretty well.
L:  Yeah, you always think so, but I think it's hard to find people who are willing to just hire a programmer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- out of the blue.
R:  Ah, what type of business do you frequent the most?
L:  Let's see.  Where do we go?  Well, I guess we rent videos a fair bit [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, and go out to eat sometimes and I think that's about it.
R:  I think a restaurant is pretty much where I fre- -- where I go the most.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Eat off -- because I'm in college, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- trying to eat off campus as much as you can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get [LAUGH] normal food.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Even like a supermarket.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  I think anything would be good.  Um, mm.
L:  I think a lot of people think it would be fun to open restaurants --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- but so many restaurants go broke --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's really hard to make a living in that, I've heard.
R:  That'd be -- you could combine like a restaurant with a bakery.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Have something original.
L:  Yep.
R:  Um.  Hm [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ten minutes feels a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah --
L:  You can probably hear my son in the background here.
R:  [LAUGH] He sounds cute.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  What's his favorite restaurant?
L:  Oh, his favorite restaurant?  Hm.  Any place where he can run around a lot [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He doesn't care --
R:  How old is he?
L:  -- that much about the food.  He's one and a half.
R:  [LAUGH] Soon it'll be McDonalds.
L:  Yeah, maybe.
R:  Maybe you could open a chain -- or a store that's a healthy version of McDonalds.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um [NOISE] let's see.
R:  Hm.
L:  Oh, I don't know [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I wonder if we have to talk about the set topic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the whole time long if we run out of things to talk about?  Um --
R:  [SIGH] Do you have any specialty in baking that would add to your business?
L:  Oh, I'm making fudge right now.
R:  Ooh.
L:  For a party for tomorrow --
R:  Would you have -- would you have, like, a -- make it -- you could make a fudge shop.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, that would be a good way to get fat, wouldn't it?
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're not allowed to touch the stuff in our business, we just sell it --
L:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.  What kind of business --
R:  A club would be a good way to stay in shape.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it would.
R:  [LAUGH] Running around all the time.  Bakery, too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just can't eat it. 
L:  Yeah, if you didn't eat too much of the stuff, yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, my mother told me she worked in a bakery when she was in high school or something and it wasn't a problem because she got so sick of all the stuff --
R:  Yeah, I could see that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You'd have to -- it would take a while, first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You'd gain the weight and then you'd get sick of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I don't think I could do a bakery [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I would get bored of cooking.  I'd say someone else can cook for me.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  I'll set the standard, so you can do it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  Um, what other kind of business could a person have [NOISE]?
R:  Ah, a daycare center [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's coming to mind, isn't it, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A babysitting business.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I know a few people who have those.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sure you use some --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh,
R:  -- quite frequently.
L:  Yeah, sometimes [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE].
R:  Um --
L:  And I think that's a hard one, though.  So [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] That I don't think I could do that too much [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  Um, have ten kids or so in the house all day long every day, by the end of the week I'd be a wreck.
R:  [NOISE] I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't do it [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't have a [inaudible].  I don't even know how I could -- my husband's a [inaudible] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not enough patience --
L:  I find that it's really different if it's your own kid.
R:  Hopefully [LAUGH].
L:  With -- with other people's kids I thought, "Oh, my goodness, toddlers, I mean, they're hopeless" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, but with your own kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you just love them so much it doesn't matter --
R:  [NOISE] I hope so [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We'll -- we'll find out what happens --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not yet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A couple of years [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're a lot of work, though --
R:  [NOISE] Well, they make any business interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I guess one nice thing with having a business is a lot of people, well, depending on the business, they can bring their kids along to work.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  So, sometimes at restaurants or places --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you see the kids hanging around.
R:  It's a good way to meet different types of people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Um, [NOISE] [LAUGH] This is hard --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Um --
L:  A friend of mine used to, um, well, she used to want to open up a business running one of those, um, what do you call them, um, you know the airport limos you can take to get to and from the airport?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  But not the big vans, the ones where somebody owns a really fancy car and they just drive that car?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, she wanted to open one of those.
R:  [NOISE] Actually, my mom used to have her own business --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my brother did also.  My mom had a cake decorating business.
L:  Oh, that sounds fun.
R:  And my brother had a web designing business.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  I think cake decorating sounds like more fun.
R:  I know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But web designing he could -- he set his own hours, he didn't have deadlines --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- he was much --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cake decorating's very stressful.
L:  Uh-huh --
R:  [NOISE] -- I --
L:  You need them all done right on time for the --
R:  Yeah [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All night the night before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, staying up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to make the cake and then there's stress that comes along with it, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people wrecking the cake an hour before the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- before the party [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I'm trying to feed my son dinner here at the same time and he's tired [SIGH].
R:  Does it stop us at ten minutes?
L:  I suppose so.
R:  Feels as to [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it's been ten minutes, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Have you ever done this before or is this your first phone call?
R:  This is my first one --
L:  Uh-huh [NOISE].
R:  Is this your first?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I just today, we didn't even know we [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] [NOISE].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So.  We weren't sure what was going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] I'm not even sure what they're really recording, but [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  I think they just want to see how people talk to each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um [SIGH]
R:  Hm [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah and I think it's usually better if you don't make a lot of pauses --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, we're going to see Lord of the Rings tonight --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- the second one, but I hadn't seen the first one, so --
L:  Uh-huh --
R:  [LAUGH] So we came and we're -- they're just giving me an overview, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I would know what's going on.
L:  Yeah, the first one's worth seeing, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We've rented it recently even though we'd already seen it before --
R:  [NOISE] I saw the --
L:  It was pretty good.
R:  -- first hour --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I got the back [LAUGH] ground.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll be asking a lot of questions all through the movie.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But -- and I'll go, it's like three hours long, it starts at twelve, so --
L:  Yeah, they're all long.  Yeah.  It starts at twelve?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Whoa.
R:  Because it comes out Wednesday --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, Tuesday night, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Too late for me.
R:  I know.  I might --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- fall asleep in the m-
