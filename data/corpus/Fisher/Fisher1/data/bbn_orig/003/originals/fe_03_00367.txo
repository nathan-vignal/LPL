R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  And you?  My name's Katie.
L:  I'm Debs.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Good to meet you.  Where are you at?
R:  I'm in New Jersey.
L:  I'm in Illinois.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh well.  [LAUGH] Um, have you ever done this before?
L:  I haven't.  This is my first one.
R:  Okay, I think we're supposed to stay on the line for ten minutes, 'cause I've been doing them.  But I haven't got any money and, like, they keep calling.  'Cause we're only supposed to do it once, right, and then they stop?
L:  [SIGH] I think you can keep doing it and they'll give you additional money.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  But, I don't know.  So --
R:  I know --
L:  -- anyway --
R:  They call, like -- they seriously call, like, six or seven times a night.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's nuts. [LAUGH]
L:  All right.  Well, okay, we'll go for ten minutes.
R:  Ok-. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, the topic was fitness, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Do you exercise regularly?
L:  [SIGH] I used to.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I guess I used to exercise really regularly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And before I went away to college I was a aerobics instructor, and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- jogged three miles a day.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  And then I went to college and pretty much did nothing. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Like most people gain the freshman fifteen -- I gained the freshman forty. 
R:  Oh man.
L:  [LAUGH] How 'bout you?
R:  Um, yeah, I try to, but it usually doesn't happen.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  I usually work out twice a week.
L:  Twice a week?
R:  Yeah.  That's if I get enough time.  But, usually that's what it is.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I --
L:  Now wh- --
R:  -- wish I could do more.
L:  Recently I decided to make that more of a commitment, so I -- I've been a member of Gold's Gym for about two years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the first year I went about five or six days a week and was doing really well.  And then I got sick and I stopped going.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when I got better I never went back again. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's it. Yeah.  That always happens.  Like, you stop going for -- like, you take a break and then it's hard to start back up again.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, recently, um, I had a bunch of job interviews -- so I wanted to get in shape for that, so I got a trainer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, went to that for about four weeks.  And then -- now, like ye- it's funny that this was the topic because I was just like, "Oh, I'm going to get back into that".  So, I went to the gym yesterday.  And then today I've been going, "Hm, I don't feel like going". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  This is actu- 
L:  So what do you d- oh, go ahead.
R:  This is actually the best topic that they've given.  Like, the other ones have been, like, impossible to talk about.
L:  Really?  Like what?
R:  Yeah.  They had a biochemical warfare -- and they gave, um -- that was one.  They also had +something about assimilation -- they had that.  Ah, censorship and music.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah.  Some of the topics are just really hard to talk, like, ten minutes on.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, what kind of, ah -- like, when you do exercise regularly, what -- or, when you think of fitness --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- health and fitness -- what do you do -- or what do you like to do?
R:  Um, I usually run as, like, a warmup.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then I stretch. And then -- my gym -- that I work out, we have the elliptical trainers.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  'Cause I think those are so much fun, so I do those.
L:  My friend really likes those too.
R:  Yeah.  They're fu- 'cause they're, like -- they're really low impact.  Like, 'cause they don't -- running hurts my knees if I do it for a long time.  So, the elliptical trainers are low impact, so it doesn't -- you don't really hurt.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It doesn't really hurt you.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, sometimes do the bikes.  And then I'll go down to the weight room --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and use the machines -- all that.
L:  I hate the weights.
R:  Oh really?  I --
L:  Yeah.  My friend --
R:  -- like the weights better.
L:  -- who I work with, she likes the weights.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I usually get on a treadmill, put on, like, my headphones, and put on a good rock station [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and do the treadmill for about an hour.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then -- like, today's a weights day, so today's a day that's easy for me to skip because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, 'cause I don't like to do that part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, when I was younger, I guess staying in -- fit -- staying fit was easier because, like, the things you did for fun -- like, what did you do?  You -- you go dancing?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so you're keeping in shape or -- my friends and I used to walk -- we weren't old enough or drive or have cars, so we walked around the neighbourhood all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whereas now it's harder to, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I remember that, 'cause during the summer I was a lifeguard at a pool down at the Jersey shore, and I couldn't -- before I got my licence --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I couldn't drive -- so I had no one to, like, drive me around, so -- and everything was so close I'd just bike everywhere.  And I -- I lost, like, so much weight doing that.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But, then once I got my licence I gained it all back again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Going [LAUGH] -- and you just go out to eat.
L:  Well, you must be in some sort of shape to be a lifeguard.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, like, you don't have to be, like, in great shape.  Like, I know I'm, like, a little overweight, but --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I'm working on that. [LAUGH]
L:  So, like where you live --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is it easy for you -- like, I kind of live in a more suburban area, so you pretty much have to drive to get anywhere.
R:  Yeah.  Same.  I live in, like -- they call it, like, the hicks of New Jersey.  Like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I live off in, like, the middle of the mountains -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- compared to the rest of New Jersey.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like, it's about a good five miles for me to get to school --
L:  Really?
R:  -- in the morning.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Are you in college or ...?
R:  Nah, I'm a senior at high school this year.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, good for you.
R:  [LAUGH] Hm.
L:  [MN] What are you going to do next year?
R:  Um, well I want to major in psychology, and then go to graduate school and do forensics --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and then criminology, and then actu- eventually I'd work for the FBI if I could.
L:  I -- that's so funny.  I just was invited to take the test for the --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- FBI training.
R:  Are you serious?
L:  And actually, it's funny that -- how fitness is our topic.  But, um, I was invited to take the written test --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but I didn't sign up.  I didn't follow through because I knew I wouldn't pass the physical test.  'Cause you have to be -- have like a -- you have to be -- basically do boot camp. [SIGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh man.
L:  So, I knew I couldn't -- it's been -- let's see, eighty nine was when I went away to college, and that's when I pretty much stopped working out regularly.  So, I'm really out of shape.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, is the test hard?
L:  [SIGH] You know, I don't know, but --
R:  I -- it --
L:  -- I know it's like, um -- I know it's like going to boot camp.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, there's a -- oh no [NOISE] I guess, like, the thing I can se- oh -- oh, it's just UPS.  They'll just leave the box.  Um, [MN] oh heck, I don't know -- this is going to sound funny.  But, like, in the movie Silence of the Lambs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, she's, like, preparing for that, at the beginning of the movie.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, part of it --
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh well.
L:  I'm pretty sure that that would keep me from doing it, but see, you're in a better place.  You're probably in better shape. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I hope, like -- 'cause for what I want to do -- like profiling --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't -- I --hopefully, like, they won't make you go through the boot camp -- you know?  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Like, just help them out.
L:  I think for everything at --
R:  Oh, everything [inaudible]?
L:  -- the FBI you have to go through it.  [NOISE]  But, I think it's just that once.  Like, if you're doing more things in the field, I think you have to keep going through --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- more things.
R:  Is it, like, a week or two?
L:  You know, I'm not sure.
R:  Uh.
L:  I -- I just knew that there was that aspect and -- because like right when you apply -- if you go to the web site.  If you to the FBI web site --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can actually apply for the FBI online, which is what I did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I didn't hear from them, and didn't really expect to hear from them.  But, I didn't hear from them for about six months.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then, eh -- like one we- one day I got this package in the mail and it was all taped up, and it was this big fat package.  And it had, like, um -- it was almost like an SAT or ACT book in there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it said you've been invited to take this test, and it's, like, on Tuesday.  So, it was, like, less than a week away. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my God. [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah -- but, when you u- go through the questions online it says part of the -- your hiring process will be to take this phys- physical exam.  Do you agree that you are in shape and can do this?  So you have to, like, agr- before you can finish the process [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- you have to say that --
R:  -- my God. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you could d- do it.
R:  Wow.
L:  But, see, like, when I was your age, I went out dancing a lot, or roller skating -- which isn't a really big thing anymore.  But, [SIGH] when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I was your age that was a big thing.  Um.  So -- I was more in shape, I think.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think, like, now, it's like, it's even harder for kids to get in shape 'cause of, like, the computer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, like, the video games.
L:  Are you looking at colleges?
R:  Yeah.  I sho- I got accepted to Seton Hall and Quinnipiac, which is a small school up in Connecticut.  
L:  Hm.
R:  But, I'm waiting to go -- I really want to go to Fairfield, up in Connecticut.
L:  Okay.
R:  Or Lehigh in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, I just had an interview with them.
R:  Oh really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Which one?  Fairfield or --
L:  No.
R:  Lehigh? 
L:  Le- Berkley High.
R:  Oh really.
L:  We have Valley.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't really know much about the other schools, but most of the schools -- one thing you'll find on campus is you walk around on campus and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it'll be easier for you to stay in shape.
R:  Oh yeah.  That's true.
L:  It's also easier to eat more because people prepare your meals for you.  So, I think, more than physical fitness -- like, it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the eating part that gets you when you go to college.
R:  Yeah, 'cause there's so much food.
L:  And, like, a lot of the dorms now they have, like, Pizza Hut, or -- or, ah, Sparrow, or Peppy's, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're really good, but also really high fat.
R:  [LAUGH] Prob- that's why they're so good. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  'Cause people used to complain about the cafeteria food, so they got all these fast food places in the dorms at a lot of the schools.  [NOISE] I me- -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm doing a graduate program right now.  That's why I know a lot about [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- schools.
R:  Oh.  What did you major in, or what are you --
L:  English
