L:  How you doing?  
R:  Ah, fine, ah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is --
R:  How are you?
L:  -- pretty neat, isn't it?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  This is pretty neat, huh?
R:  Yeah, it's interesting.
L:  I was sitting at home and the phone rings, and it's, like, "Who's calling me this late?"
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  How are you doing?  I'm Ron Tomilton.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.  I'm Sheryl Slocombe.
L:  Where are you located at?
R:  Ah, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.
L:  Ah, so it's a little earlier for you.  I'm out in, ah, Washington DC.
R:  Oh yeah.  So -- oh, ten twenty, yeah? [LAUGH]  But --
L:  But anyway, to make a long story short, they got -- they picked -- they couldn't have picked a worse guy to pick this topic.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I could care less about sports.
R:  Well, like you -- you had the option to not do it, you know?
L:  Oh yeah.  But, then again, I wouldn't want be put on, ah, this guy doesn't want to accept anything.
R:  Oh, that's true, yeah.
L:  So, I'd figure I can fake it.  I do watch some sports, but only when there's, like, nothing else on.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  I don't mind skiing 'cause I do snow ski.
R:  Ooh.  Do you do [MN] downhill or just --
L:  Downhill.
R:  -- cross country? Oh.  Where do you go for downhill skiing?
L:  Um, my, um, ah -- I shouldn't even say father in law -- my ex father in law now --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- had a place in Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is, ah -- the only other thing that's near it is a place called Seven Springs, which is a little more famous, I guess.
R:  Is that the areas of the Poconos?
L:  Um, kind of southwest of the Poconos --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I would say.
R:  I -- I -- I've been in the Poconos --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and those certainly would be good skiing mountains, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah.  Do you ski?
R:  Ah, no.  I have a --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- bad knee, so I -- I've watched skiing, and I grew up in Colorado and Wyoming, so --
L:  Oh my God --
R:  I saw --
L:  -- must be hard.
R:  -- some really skiing, but, um -- no, I've never skied.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And the sport I actually watch on TV the most, which is very little. [LAUGH]  When they said, "How many hours do you watch a week?" it was, like, well, probably I average twenty minutes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a month -- but, it's football, because I love to watch football.
L:  Do you really?  What -- what's your team out there?
R:  Wel- Green Bay Packers. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, you're a cheese head, huh? 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I d- I may sort of decline the title, but yes, I -- I suppose I'm a -- a supporter of the Green Bay Packers.  But, um, lived in the south for quite a while, so, ah, football's really big down there.
L:  Where in the south?
R:  Louisiana.  I taught at --
L:  Ah, you've been all over.
R:  -- LSU.  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, Louisiana's nice.  I've -- the closest I've been would be New Orleans.
R:  Oh well, yeah, we lived there.  My, ah, middle child was born there.
L:  Great place.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Absolutely great place.
R:  It is.  Well -- and are you from Washington DC?
L:  Yeah, I've lived here all my life.
R:  Uh-huh.  Have you gone to any -- now, I know we're supposed to be talking about TV games, but have you gone to any, um, you know, of the pro games out there --
L:  Um, I think --
R:  -- of any kind?
L:  -- I went to a Washington Redskins football game when I was about five --     
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'm forty four.
R:  Yeah, well, okay.  You can probably --
L:  So, it was quite a while ago.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then mother's --
R:  You can remember it.
L:  -- a nut.  I don't know if you know, well, like -- well, like you know what every sports team has the same type of following.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, they say that the Redskins fans are one of the more outrageous types.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And my mother's really into it, but I just --
R:  [MN]
L:  I just never got into it.
R:  Yeah, well, ah. [LAUGH] 
L:  At all.
R:  I -- I enjoy -- I really do enjoy watching sports, partly because there are people who are so into that -- that's just fascinates me, that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, wh- all they'll do, and all they'll pay.  I can't believe what people pay.
L:  Oh I know -- couple of hundred dollars to go sit for three hours.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unbelievable.
R:  Or, a couple of hundred dollars to go sit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for three hours in the cold. [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Well, I stayed with my mom on New Year's Eve and, ah -- actually Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.  She only lives about twenty minutes from me.  And the game would come on, and I went back upstairs to my old bedroom --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and huddled on my computer.  I carry a laptop about --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- everywhere I go.  And she's down there screaming and yelling --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and telling me to come see this.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, "Mom, how many times do I got to tell you, I don't care".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It does nothing for me.  Plus they had another losing season anyway.
R:  Yeah, well, of course mothers never lose hope for their sons.  You know, they --
L:  Yeah well, I wasn't -- I tell you, she's a great lady.  I wouldn't be anywhere without her.
R:  [LAUGH] That's for sure, but --
L:  I know.  Are you a mother?
R:  Yes. I have three kids, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  You don't sound that old -- very well.
R:  Well, you know, they -- they keep you young too. [LAUGH] 
L:  I should hope so.  How long are we supposed to do this?  Do they shut us off?  Or do we just talk 'til we drop?
R:  I -- I -- I think we sort of talk 'til we're tired of talking, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, they did -- uh [MN] -- how did you find out about this?  Off the Internet?
R:  Ah, yeah.  I -- I'm in a -- I'm working toward a degree in a linguistics program and so one of our professors routed it to everybody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I thought, "Hello --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- what the heck".  You know, it'll help research.
L:  You getting a degree?  What kind of a degree?  
R:  Um, I'm getting a PhD in teaching, ah, English as a second language.
L:  Well, that is very impressive.  PhD doesn't come easy.
R:  Well, yeah.  Although at least it's in teaching, so it's a little easier than someone doing some kind of theoretical thing.
L:  Is it easy to get a job with a PhD in Engli- in, ah, ESOL?
R:  Actually in ESL it's pretty easy to get a job.  The PhD --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doesn't make much difference at all.  Um, you know, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're going to pay you low [LAUGH] to teach people English.  But, there are lots of people who want to learn English.
L:  Well, if it gets bad, come on out here to Washington DC --
R:  Yeah, I used to teach --
L:  -- 'cause we can't even go to a seven eleven and order cigarettes without --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- having to have a map.
R:  I used to teach out there.
L:  Did you really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's where I met my former husband -- was in Washington DC.
L:  Where at?
R:  Um, well, um, at Saint Pauls, Quay Street.  If you've heard of the Episcopal Church that's --
L:  Oh absolutely.
R:  -- down at the Foggy Bottom.  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's -- that's a big one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm not actually in DC.  I'm outside of DC, in Germantown, Maryland.
R:  Oh yeah.  Okay.  And we lived on the other side.  We lived in Arlington.
L:  Know -- know exactly where.
R:  It's -- it's a nice area.  I really enjoyed living there.  Lots to do.  I worked for the Tourist Bureau, ah, to put myself through school.  So, I just had, you know -- went into all kinds of interesting things.
L:  You're a real firecracker, aren't you?
R:  Oh, I had fun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  What do you do?
L:  It's the only way to go.
R:  [LAUGH] What do you do out there?
L:  I am into cellular phones, pagers, wireless Internet --
R:  Ah.
L:  All that techno babble stuff.
R:  And that's how you heard about this, was doing techno babble stuff, huh?
L:  Well, I was in -- I was in a news group that -- I do about seven news groups.  I spend about --  
R:  Wow.
L:  -- an hour every night.  And th- somebody posted this up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, like I was started to say, I think -- I thought it was hokey.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.  At first I was wondering, but --
L:  And I was real concerned when I saw that I had to put my social security number down.
R:  I didn't do it.  I just, ah --
L:  Me neither.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I thought, "Well now, you know, thirty dollars -- argh, it's not that much, and it's not worth losing my identity". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, the bottom line is -- is that when it comes time for pay fine -- pay time -- not to mention I'm pretty sure that somebody m- didn't go to this much trouble just to be funny.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I'll be glad to give it to 'em over the phone maybe, but I'm not putting it out on the Internet.
R:  Yeah, yeah. I -- I felt ah, too -- too strange about doing that so I didn't do it either.
L:  I was really surprised they actually asked for it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I was -- I was too, but I thought, "Well, you know --" I didn't know anything about if you're trying to pay people.  Maybe you need it for tax purposes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or something.
L:  They got to write it off.  Probably they're going to have to issue out ten ninety nine at the end of the year.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  Well, this should be a really interesting study 'cause they're going to get lots and lots of data.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Now, of course, they're going to have to pay people to go through all this and transcribe it.
L:  Well, they probably have a huge grant. D- you sound like you probably know more about it than me.
R:  Yeah, well I, you know --
L:  I mean, what is the actual game plan here?  What are they doing?
R:  Well, probably what they're doing is they're getting all this recording and then they've got, you know, graduate students who will listen to these hours of recording and transcribe it and it goes into a computer.  And then we linguists use these big computer banks full of language to do research, and they could research anything.  I mean, how many times people use the word the.  Or, ah, grammer -- like, um, you know, we -- you and I have slightly different accents when --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we talk. So, so- someone could look at --
L:  You --
R:  -- pronunciation.
L:  -- sound like you live right down the street, to be honest.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Actually -- and you don't have much of an accent either.  Um, yo- but, people in Washington DC tend to sort of speak that --
L:  It's kind of a melting pot spot.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And I've travelled so many different places in the country I've sort of gained that accent free -- it's not really accent free, but that standard accent, I suppose you'd call it.
L:  Well, I must thank you, because you made real easy.  At first, I was sitting there and they go, "Hold while we search for another participant".
R:  Oh, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm going, "Am I really up for this?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I get some knucklehead -- I'm just not in the mood right now tonight.
R:  Well, and I was worried when I heard -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a man's voice, and thought, "Oh boy.  I'm going to have to talk to some guy about sports and he's probably really gung ho".  So I'm glad you weren't [LAUGH] too gung ho.  I would've --
L:  [inaudible] and then you got to sit there and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- pretend you're half way interested for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- three or four minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, you made it real easy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think we probably shot our dime.  I got a TV dinner down in the microwave and it's starting --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to get cold.
R:  Okay.  Well, enjoy your, ah, midnight snack.
L:  But, I really enjoyed talking to you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and maybe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we'll get hooked up again.
R:  Yeah.  Well, good luck. [LAUGH]
L:  Good luck with your PhD.  You sound like a great gal.
R:  Yeah, thank you.
L:  Take care.
R:  Hm, bye.
L:  Bye bye.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
