R:  Hi. [NOISE]  My name is Jerry.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, Jerry.  I'm Debbie.  How are you doing?
R:  All right.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  South Dakota.
L:  Oh, cool -- cool.  I'm in Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, you want to discuss -- how long do we talk?
R:  I have no idea.  This is the first time I've actually gotten through.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I had lost my PIN number and gotten, um, like, six calls and couldn't them 'cause I didn't have my PIN number.  They called today and gave me my PIN number.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, this is the first one.  I asked them, "Do we have to talk about the subject?"  She said if we wanted to.  It was just a helper.  But, we can talk about the subject if you want.
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  Okay.  Yes, I feel there are countries that threaten us, as we speak.  But, I mean, I'm sure you do too.
R:  Yeah.  But it's not -- it's not just the Middle East now.  I mean, look at -- look at Mexico.
L:  Mexico?
R:  Mexico.
L:  What are they doing?
R:  What are they doing?  Well, they got these, ah -- they got these groups like La Raza, and Metcha[?], and all those that think that, you know, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico actually still belong to Mexico.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And -- and, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're -- they actually have militant groups.  And a lot -- a lot of people don't realise this.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, they're out there.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.  If -- if you go to a search engine, like Google or something --
L:  Mm, I love Google.
R:  And -- and put in La Raza.  L.A. and space R.A.Z.A. and you've got, you know, these -- these groups that, you know, think America is theirs.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And you know, it -- it seems to me that -- how -- how does a country destroy another country?  You send in a bunch of people to ruin it.  And what they're doing is they're -- all those hospitals at the border, they're all going bankrupt.  Um --
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, I mean, there's -- and nobody's doing anything about illegal immigration.  These -- these guys down there, they have to, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- band their little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- militias together --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to try to actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do something.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's pretty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they won't even, you know, put a fence on the border, or even defend it. 
L:  No, see, I didn't even know that.  I -- I never would've thought of Mexico.  I think of the bigger powers, you know, like --
R:  Well, my --
L:  -- I don't know -- Russia or Japan, because ...
R:  Yeah.  But, they're -- they're only -- I don't know -- they're on other side of the ocean.  I think that, you know, if they decided to send missiles, you know -- you know, they'd get shot down before they hit the mainland.  But, you know --
L:  Maybe.
R:  And then, you know, you got, like, people like the -- the idiots from nine eleven.  You know, they could have been filtered out.  Nobody -- the INS just doesn't do their job.  They don't track these people down.  I mean, come on.  If somebody came from a hostile country and decided they wanted aviation lessons, you know, somebody should realise that.  Somebody should take notice.
L:  Oh well, I do.  I think they knew.  I think they had more information.  They just didn't act on it.
R:  What?  You think -- you think they wanted a -- a war, like what's his name let, um, Japan bomb Pearl Harbour, or ...?  Maybe a war --
L:  I think they thought --
R:  -- would be good --
L:  -- it really --
R:  -- for the economy?
L:  -- wouldn't happen.
R:  Oh.  They didn't think anyone was crazy enough to crash into a building on purpose?
L:  Yeah.  No -- you know, I think that they'd have suspicions.  And I think they knew --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the threats, but I don't think they really thought it would happen.  'Cause I'm sure that our government gets millions of threats.
R:  Oh, yeah.  From -- from --
L:  You know?  And how do you know which one is the real one?
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] I don't know.  I still think Mex- Mexico -- we should focus on, you know, our neighbors more than, you know, a country that doesn't like -- like, they want to bomb Iraq, you know.  What -- what has Iraq done in the past ten years?  You know, we went ten years ago, [MN] the crap out of them.  They haven't bothered anybody, you know.
L:  No, but I really thought then we should --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- send --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the CIA --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in there to kill the Ayatollah Khomeini.   
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  Se- se- -- you know, get one of those, you know, mobs- mobster hit men out of one of the, you know, federal penitentiaries, and say, "Hey, look.  You -- you want to be released?  Go whack Saddam".
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean, it can't be -- you know, we have people -- we kill people --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all the time.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, duly[?] thinking a --
L:  I've always wondered why we just didn't -- in[?] -- send in a hit man, let him infiltrate, let him be part of their little gang for a while, and then just up and blow him away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never understood that, because you can't tell me it's impossible.
R:  Yeah, it's possible.  Anything's possible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  And you have these soldiers of fortune.  Hell, they would've loved that.
R:  Yeah.  You know, give them -- you know, pay their expenses and give them a million bucks tax free.  It'd be cheaper than, you know, shipping soldiers over there.
L:  Wouldn't it though?
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, that -- that'd be the way to go, I think.  But then again, I want capital punishment.  I think we should cane people in prison. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I have some pretty weird beliefs.  I mean, I also think prostitution should be legalized.  So, I mean, I go both ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, but I'd never thought about Mexico.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I keep thinking of that, um -- oh, what is the Texas people always say?  Remember the Alamo.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the Mexicans riled up then, and they fought to the death even though they knew they were gonna lose.
R:  Yeah.  Except -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- this -- you know this -- this time --
L:  These are a proud people.  You really have to take them kind of seriously.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause even if they don't win they're gonna hurt ya.
R:  Yeah.  And I think, you know, they -- I mean, [NOISE] they got the -- I mean, they've got, you know, TV stations here [NOISE] that, ah -- that Univision.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  you know, that, ah -- the Mexican station with the -- the -- I remember it's got the little bee or whatever. [NOISE]  You know, the -- the guy that runs that isn't even a US citizen.  And, you know, instead of calling them illegal immigrants, the media likes to call them undocumented, you know, workers or whatever -- undocumented immigrants.  The term illegal immigrants is gone, you know?
L:  Oh, everything is some new term.  That -- that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- drives me nuts too.
R:  And politi- political correctness is -- is what these guys are feeding on.  They come here, they --
L:  And it's crazy -- it's crazy.
R:  I mean, if someone wants to, you know, knock on the front door and say, "Hey, can I come in?" I -- you know, I don't have a problem with that.  But --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  No, sneaking across the border, and then, you know, the -- those poor ranchers --
L:  Excuse me just a moment?
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, you can try it in the door, but keep it if it is. [PAUSE] [NOISE]  Okay.  I'm sorry.
R:  No, that's all right.
L:  [NOISE] Now -- now wh- what'd you say?  I lost my whole train of thought.  It was like --
R:  Oh, they -- you know, you got these ranchers down there [NOISE] that, ah -- you know, they -- they come and they sneak over the border, they're hungry --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're cold, they're tired.  They come in.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, and this -- I don't know if you've ever lived in a rural part [NOISE] of the country.  You know, if you -- if you're on a farm where you've got, you know -- you're behind a couple of acres of corn or whatever nobody's gonna hear ya if someone breaks down your door and robs ya.  I mean, there's -- there's stories about that all the time.
L:  You know, it's true.  And do you know -- I wasn't aware of this.  I don't know if all states are alike, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] I had a man break into my house a couple of years ago, and he got away.  It was really devastating.
R:  [NOISE]
L: And I was talking to the police.  I said, "Well, next time I'm getting a gun and next time I'll kill him".  'Cause I was home.  It was really bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And in our state --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they come in you have to let them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out.
R:  What?
L:  Yeah.  I have to open a door and give them clear passage out, and offer them the chance to leave.
R:  Well, you can't shoot him.  And then you can't turn around and say, "Hey, you forgot some gold jewellery" and shoot him in the back yard?
L:  I'm going to shoot them anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I told the police th- [LAUGH].
R:  I'm sure -- I'm sure there's, you know, plenty of women's rights groups that would say, "Hey, you know, the male aggressor was trying to rob ya.  You have every right to defend yourself" or, um.
L:  Right.  But, if you just see them in your house robbing you, you -- you can ask them if they want to leave. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Sure. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They dig-
L:  Yeah, "I appreciate if you don't shoot me, and if you'd like to leave, you know --"
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  You can leave in a ambulance.
L:  And you have to back up and give them clear venue.  I mean, you have to back off and let them actually walk out of the house.  I couldn't believe it.
R:  Yeah.  They can -- well, if they can walk to the ambulance, more power to 'em.
L:  Well, I'm not even planning for that.  I'm taking them down. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If they come in again, I am ready.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  They can't -- they can't sue ya if, you know, they don't have a pulse.
L:  That's right.
R:  'Cause even, you know, some people, you know, they -- they rob your house.  If they trip over something you leave on the floor they'll -- they'll sue ya from their jail cell. 
L:  Isn't that the truth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Freaks me out.  I have a pool and, you know, some of the neighbors have asked me, you know, "Can my child swim in it?" and I've told them, "If you come and watch 'em, and I may have to have something drawn up". 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I mean, I don't -- 
R:  Make 'em -- 
L:  -- want to be cruel -- 
R:  Make 'em -- 
L:  -- or anything.
R:  Make 'em sign a waiver, otherwise you'll, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You'll pay out the ass for home owner's insurance if something happens
L:  Yeah.  And see, I don't -- as a rule I just don't normally let anybody unless, you know -- my friends, because I know my friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they could sue me too.  I mean, you know.
R:  [MN] I don't know.  If I had -- I won't have a pool for that reason.  I might see -- you know, if the person watching their own child is a certified life guard.
L:  That's about the size of it.
R:  You know?
L:  Really, in my pool, my best friend comes over and that's about it.
R:  I mean, I got little kids and they've got one of those --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, slip and slides.  And I'm funny about, you know, the neighbors coming over and playing on that 'cause if they slip and twist an ankle, you know, it's --
L:  It can happen, um.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- speaking with some friends and they had -- they were friends with another --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- couple.  And I asked them why don't I -- I said, "I never see this other couple anymore, you know.  What happened to 'em?".  And this -- ah, what am I gonna bid?  On- -- I play Spades for money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] One, two. [NOISE] I'll go two.  Anyway, I asked them why I never see this other couple.  And it turns out they had all gone out fishing, and been drinking on the boat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Came back in.  The other couple was at their house and they were cleaning the fish, and the guy slipped cleaning the fish and slit his --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wrist.   
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think he had to have blood, and he had to get stitches, and they had --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to have surgery due to some tendons --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- being cut.  Anyway --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- he sued 'em.
R:  Oh, jeeze. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's insane.
L:  It is.  It's really -- it's -- it's insane.  [NOISE] Okay keep it on your way.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That would freak me out.  Um, they wouldn't be my friends anymore either.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, now, you know -- nowadays you got -- you got kids suing their parents and everything else.  It's just nuts.
L:  It really is.  So, what do you do for a living?  You're home at a neat time.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, actually I do painting and dry wall and, ah, it's -- there's not a lot of work for that.  I actually moved out here from Chicago about a year ago --
