L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Grameo.  Hi.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  My name is Penny.
L:  Hi, Penny.
R:  Hi.
L:  Ah.  This is actually my first such call, ah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, this is the first time.  I've tried a few times before, but the system hasn't worked very well, um, in terms of getting through.  So, um, ah, I haven't done this either before.  So, we're supposed to talk about whether we would commit perjury for a friend?
L:  Yes.  So, I suppose that, ah, we, ah, that our friend probably committed some sort of crime and -- and we know about it and, ah, are supposed to say that something to hide the fact.
R:  Oh.  Well, gee, you know, I -- I -- I don't think I would do that, although I'm not sure.  I mean, ah, it's a little easy to say in a -- you know, in the abstraction at a distance.  But I -- I -- I kind of don't think I would, ah, lie for a friend or, um, basically I don't know if it's all for -- just for good reasons.  I -- I think I'm pretty chicken and I -- I -- I think I would probably get caught.  I don't think I'm a very good liar.  So --
L:  Yeah, that -- that would be my worry as well, that -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that if I did get caught lying then, ah, then -- then my friend would go down with, ah, in -- in the system --
R:  Well --
L:  -- much more so than if I hadn't lied --
R:  Well, that's right.
L:  --  I would just try and stay out of the situation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the first place.
R:  Yeah, I think that's true.  I agree.  I would probably not only not help my friend then, but I would probably fundamentally hurt them because, I don't know, the in- -- the inference when somebody lies for you is that there's a reason to lie for you and -- and that would make them look, I mean, you know, depending on what the situation was, it would make them look somewhat guilty.  So.
L:  Yeah.  I wonder if -- I -- I -- I -- I wonder that my friend would even ask me to do such a thing.  Um.
R:  Well, maybe they wouldn't ask you too.  What if they didn't ask you to --
L:  Oh, that's an interesting point.
R:  -- what if you just were in the situation where --
L:  Where -- where I just knew that something happened and I thought --
R:  You said might make --
L:  -- that if I said something I would incriminate --
R:  Right.  Or make them look bad.
L:  -- the person.
R:  I mean, it could be that you don't know if they've done it, but you know, you know, there -- if someone asks you, you know, ah, something and you know that, you know, that they might have a reason to --
L:  Well, I mean, it's not just someone asking you.  Perjury means in a court of law, after all.
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  Right.  And under oath.
R:  Right.  Right.  But you can have --
L:  As a matter of fact.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you have to have gotten to the point where -- where you are called to the stand --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- to testify in order for it to be perjury.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's true.  That's true.  But I would assume at some point you would have been interviewed or something.  I -- I don't know. 
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think I -- I -- I -- I --
L:  Perhaps I would have been smart enough at an interview to pretend I didn't know anything at all [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that gets around the [inaudible] but if you thought you wouldn't get caught, would you do it?
L:  Um, well, I don't know.  I might, I -- it really depends on -- on what it was that I was lying about and -- and, ah, and why and -- and [MN] what the whole purpose was and what the lie was and so on.  I mean, we -- we each stretch the truth in various ways --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for different things and I -- I -- if -- if, ah, [SIGH], I don't know, I can't think of a concrete situation where I would --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'm not sure that I would necessarily rule out the possibility [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.  I -- I kind of agree.  I -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't easily foresee the situation where I would, you know, either be asked to, or know something, or, you know, you know, I've never been in that position where I've, you know, been asked to testify about anything or do anything like that, so I --
L:  Yeah.  I've -- I've never set foot in a -- a court --
R:  Excuse me?
L:  I've never set foot in a court.
R:  Never set foot in a court?
L:  A courtroom, yeah.
R:  [MN] I've never been involved in any -- I don't think I've been involved in any litigation myself.  Um, but I have been in courtrooms, but, um, but more to observe than to, ah, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than to be, ah, you know, to be asked to do something.  I don't know.  It's interesting.  I, you know, um, I don't know.  How long we -- how long are we supposed to discuss this for --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are we supposed to be -- have a lot to say?
L:  [several inaudible words] I mean, there are a fair number of different places to take it.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- I [inaudible] there's -- it's all so fascinating, now that I think about it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ah, given that I've never been in a courtroom --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I wonder if I were suddenly put in one and, ah, and put under oath whether I would really be very good at lying.  Ah, even -- however much the attorney had prepared me --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I suppose the attorney would prepare me ahead of time, ah, it would be -- I still question whether in front of a judge I might not slip up.
R:  Mhm.  Or, you mean, not -- not lie [LAUGH]?  When you intended to?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah [several inaudible words] the truth [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, excuse me, I really meant to say [LAUGH].
L:  No, [inaudible] truly [LAUGH] your honor.  In reality I meant to say exactly the opposite.
R:  The opposite.  Yeah.  I -- I guess that I really -- I do not like lying in general and, ah, but -- and I really do sort of mostly believe in telling the truth or avoid telling it, if I can't avoid it, but I don't like lying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm really terrible at it and my face almost always telegraphs if I'm not telling the truth or if I'm [inaudible] comfortable about something, so I -- I just think I -- I wouldn't  -- I would be the worst person, if [inaudible] to lie for them.
L:  Huh.
R:  Um, I mean, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, you could imagine there are some situations in which you believe that the system is actually corrupt and you might want to lie for someone --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and there are some situations in which --
L:  Indeed.
R:  -- the system is corrupt.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Now, there's a situation where I might definitely lie.  So, if, ah, if it was sort of a matter of civil disobedience --
R:  Yeah.  For example.
L:  -- um, where -- where I was actively involved in the movement --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where, ah, some other member of the movement did something that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I knew about of course and perhaps would have been part of --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- and I was simply trying to fight the system.  So -- so, in -- under those circumstances, perhaps.
R:  All right, then --
L:  But then I think I would be fairly calm about it.
R:  You -- you think you would be calm about it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I still think I'm a terrible liar.  I -- I just don't [LAUGH] a good liar.
L:  Well, all right.  I'd practice before [inaudible] with a -- with a polygraph.
R:  Right.  I -- I think, um, I -- I don't know, I just don't think I'm that good at telling a story.  I'd really have to practice it so that I, you know, I didn't.  But I could say where there are reasons why I, you know, would think it was ethical to lie, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I mean, I don't think that's a typical situation, but I -- I do see that, ah --
L:  Yeah, it's -- its, ah 
R:  -- if you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know --
L:  There are always situations that -- that, you know, that's why I didn't really want to decide outright, that make you do one thing or another.  Um, I -- it gets me to thinking how it would be that I'd go about preparing -- if I -- if I had decided beforehand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I was going to lie, um, then -- then I would want to prepare and do a good job --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- the way I would prepare and do a good job of anything else.  Um, and so I -- I would -- I could think I would have to learn and --
R:  Right.  I think it --
L:  -- put some deal of effort into lying convincingly.  That's -- that's an interesting thing to think about.  And do I want to put that effort into lying convincingly even before coming up with the situation.
R:  Mhm.  You know.  Yeah, I wouldn't -- I -- like I said, I wouldn't be too happy about -- about it just because I don't believe I'm a great liar, but, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I -- I could see where I might want to, ah, you know, and -- and I -- and I -- I suppose in a way it can be almost a way of civil disobedience.  I mean, you're taking the, um, risk yourself if you get caught that you will suffer consequence for it, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and I -- I -- I could -- I could see, ah, see doing that, um, you know, if I -- if I really thought that --
L:  Yeah.  Best way probably be to set up the situation in the first place where no one had to lie.
R:  [MN] well, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, if you're doing something that -- that is, you know --
L:  Well, part of the point of civil disobedience, right --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is that you're doing things that you're willing to take responsibility for --
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  -- so, I -- mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when people organize sit ins, it wasn't so much that they organized sit ins and then ran away and tried to say, "Oh, we didn't do it" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were very clear about, "Yeah, we did that and we're going to keep doing it until things change".
R:  Yeah, but I -- I was thinking --
L:  You know.
R:  -- also about like other situations, I'm not really so much, you know, now --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, what if you lived in apartheid -- ah, South Africa during the time of apartheid?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then it wouldn't be so much civil disobedience as your own firm belief that the system itself was so corrupt that, you know, what they might be trying to arrest someone for, you know, was so fundamentally wrong that you wanted to help keep them from getting arrested at all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's a much more farfetched example, I suppose, but it -- it seems real to me that --
L:  [several inaudible words] where -- where you just know that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the authorities are out to get you.
R:  Well, right, right.  And -- and from time to time you do hear stories, I mean, ah, I mean I -- I --you know, I don't talk to police in general, but I think it is a hard job in some ways, I think it's hard sometimes not to get overly zealous and not believe that you, for example, have already correct person when you haven't and then, you know, different things can happen that can be terrible for someone, I mean, I just recently, I don't know if you keep track of the news, but they recently, ah discovered that these kids that they arrested half a dozen years ago or more in New York City for the very famous rape in Central Park --
L:  Yeah, I -- I --
R:  -- actually didn't do it.
L: -- did see that.  Well --
R:  And --
L:  -- they discovered that they didn't necessarily do that particular rape or at least they weren't the only ones, but there was some older, ah, guy --
R:  Well, they -- I don't think -- they think they might have done some other bad things in the park --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- it wasn't clear they did any rapes, but -- and the guys indicated that -- that they hadn't participated in it --
L:  Yeah.  That looked really suspicious because they did confess --
R:  Well, but that's the point.  People do confess to things that they haven't committed because sometimes they're in a situation where they're afraid, or they're, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, so I'm just saying, I -- I can see situations where if I believed my friend -- and people do, do, you know, sometimes, ah, out of fear of being told that if you confess you won't get the death penalty, we have proof, we can whatever, you know, I -- I think that, you know, it does -- it does happen all the time, actually.  It doesn't happen all the time, all the time, but it does happen.  So, I'm just saying that if it was a situation like that, which is the unusual situation, I could definitely see that, you know, I would want to
