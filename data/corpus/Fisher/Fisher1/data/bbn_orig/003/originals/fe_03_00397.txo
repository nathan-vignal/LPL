L:  Hello.  Ah, my name is Dacna[?]
R:  Hi.  My name is Jason.
L:  And so, what do you think?  Do you think --
R:  I think computers in education's a very good idea.  I think it gives a much more, ah, dynamic and visual learning feel.
L:  But, don't you think that there's also a -- a negative side to computers in education?  Because if all the effort goes into, um, how cool +everything looks and [LIPSMACK] how, um, interesting --
R:  Do they get away from --
L:  -- it will be, then people don't have any time to -- I mean, or at least, less time to pay attention to content.  And then there's the problem because you, ah, don't get as much content as you would if, um --
R:  I think it's -- 
L:  -- you p-
R:  I think it's a great tool in addition to, you know, the -- the standard way you educate now.  I think it's -- it's -- it should be used supplementary, but not as, you know, only -- as the single purpose for education.
L:  So, do you think it should start from say, um, kindergarten? 
R:  Um, I think --
L:  Or elementary school?  Or --
R:  I think getting kids used to just the whole -- not -- you know, just getting used to how a computer works young is good, because they're becoming more and more prevalent in society.  But --
L:  Right, but --
R:  I would --
L:  -- do you really --
R:  -- wouldn't say --
L:  -- need school to do that?  Because if you look at kids today, they know -- I don't know -- by the time they're seven or something like this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they know so much about how to use computers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just from the fact that they have computers at home that their parents, um, let them play with the computers.  And there are all these, you know, education software that they get at home anyway, if they -- if, you know -- if they have a computer.  Which of course brings us to the point that not everybody would have access to computers if you didn't have this in education.  So, I guess I accept your -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I think it's a -- I think it's a good supplementary tool.  I don't think it's a substitute for teachers, or for good old fashioned note taking, or anything like that.
L:  So, in what subjects can you use it, do you think?
R:  Um, I think -- I think earlier you would use it more interactively, you know, to show -- to show stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, to -- you know, to maybe take -- take the chalk out of the teacher's hand so he can walk around -- you know, so he doesn't have to sit there and write on the board.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, he can walk around --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and do stuff like that.  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- I think it should be mo- --used more interactively, more just graphically at -- at the younger ages.  And as the -- as you get older, more as a research tool.
L:  So, in the younger age would you teach them -- I don't know -- spelling, or math?  I mean, when I was -- when I was over in elementary school we had computers and we used them to do math, and it was all sorts of games, um, associated with it.  So, you had some, you know, multiplication --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- addition, whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you also had little games where you -- you have a bunny and the faster you add, the faster your bunny moves, or things like this.  And this was quite fun, so I agree this is a --
R:  Yeah.  Any way to -- any way that -- to -- to get a -- a child, kid, adult, young adult more interested.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, 'cause, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- learning in general isn't always the most fun thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- especially if it's a subject --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- you're not into.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I -- I mean you can't say, "Well, I think --"
L:  Like, English, spelling, for instance, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say that, you know, oh, you know, only -- you know, only educate in the kids in what -- in the subjects they don't like with computers.  But, in -- in the senses of, you know, maybe one day a week you do a full class of, you know, whatever, geography in -- in computer -- you know, using computers to help -- [LIPSMACK] to help you get into it a little bit more.
L:  But, I think that basically means that -- I mean, you need to have good software, right?  And --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- in order to develop good software, you need to invest a lot of money.  So, um, that means that the same software would have to be used all over -- I don't know -- the country, or each state, or --
R:  There'd have to be some kind of standardization -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:   -- of -- you know, it wouldn't have to be the same exact software, but just the same --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, if it's -- [MN] -- my point is that if it's not the sa- -- exact same software, then nobody will develop this kind of software because it's not going to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're not going to see any profit on it.
R:  True -- true.  That's a good point.
L:  And this means in -- in turn that -- I mean, if you want to, like, have -- I don't know -- you have three geography classes a week.  Geography's actually a good -- a good example for something you can use computers to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, ah, if you have three geography classes a week, and one of them you do with the whatever software, um, you know, you can buy from whoever who develops it, then that 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- means it has -- I mean, this really in- invades everything you -- you do about, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- teaching geography. [NOISE]  Because if it's, like, one class a week it has to be completely interrelated with what you're teaching when you're, you know, teaching.
R:  Yeah, it would have to go along with your -- your lesson plan, your text book, whatever.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- chapter one, you -- you know, you do this lesson or whatever.
L:  Mhm.  And do you think it can work?
R:  Do I think it could work?
L:  I mean -- yeah.  I mean, for --
R:  I think it works.
L:  From -- from --
R:  I think it can work.  I mean, it's -- they're using it today.
L:  Did you have computers when you were at, like -- I don't know, in elementary school or in high school?
R:  No.  I didn't -- my first computer interaction wasn't until probably, like, my -- my la- -- eighth grade or so.
L:  [MN] In school, or in general?
R:  In -- actually in school.  Or in general, I'm sorry, in general.  But it was in school.
L:  Okay.  So, you're first computer interaction was in school?  Interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what subject was it in?  Or --
R:  It was computer class.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was --
L:  And what were you --
R:  It was eighth grade.  It was, you know -- I think it was a standard class.  Ah, everybody had to take it.  It was just a computer, you know -- intro to computers type class.  This is how you turn 'em on.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Here's a fun little game you can play.  
L:  Right
R:  You know, stuff like that.
L:  Ha.  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's interesting, because my first interaction with a computer was in -- also in school, and also in a computer class.  But, at the same time I had these -- as I told you before, um, math classes and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so we had math, I think, four hours a week or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  and on Fridays we als- -- always had math in the computer lab, and just had all these games and all sorts of stuff.  But, at some point it got [SIGH] m- -- I mean, it was just more of the same.  It w- -- got repetitious that -- it was boring.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, this is something that should be taken into consideration.
R:  Yeah.  That can -- it can get just as boring as sitting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a normal classroom every day.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I guess [MN] if you want to, um, [LIPSMACK] get people to actually use computers in a fruitful way in the classroom you need to invest a lot of money in that.
R:  Yeah.  It'll -- it -- it'll take money and some kind of standardization, I would think.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, but I think -- I think -- I think they're awesome tools.  And I, you know -- I think, ah, too many kids look at them as a Internet machine and as a game machine.  And I think, you know, there's a lot of other things that you can do with them that you should see earlier.  You know?
L:  Maybe you want to give an example for the geom- -- ah, geometry -- for -- geometry's --
R:  Which[?] --
L:  -- also good, but geography that you raised before?
R:  Well, if -- I mean, you [MN] -- for geography, you know, say --
L:  I don't know -- you can switch to geometry if you feel like it.
R:  Well, whatever.  Well, we used -- geography's easy I guess.  Um, you would go to something like -- oh, chapter one, you're -- you're studying South East Asia, so year one computer class has a whole interactive -- it'd -- it'd be almost the equivalent to a -- like a film.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- or like a slide show, with some questions.  Or, you know, questions answers -- that [MN] -- like a quiz type thing at the end.  You know, but it --
L:  Right.  Because otherwise -- if you don't have anything that, ah -- that the kids should --
R:  To motivate them to -- yeah.
L:  Exactly.  No, but if you don't have anything, ah, that the kids should -- should, ah, bring to this, like any input from th- -- from the -- from the student, then you can do a slide show in the class.  You can show --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a film in the class, right?  So, there has to be some added --
R:  Well, I think --
L:  -- interactive --
R:  I think the added interactive is well, the kid can move along at his own pace and there -- I think there's a lot more -- I think you're a lot more into it if you are controlling the slide show and what's going on.  You -- you know, like -- it's -- it's the same slide show or, you know, movie for everybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, if you want to move back or forward -- I think you're going to pay -- you know, when they show a film in a class of thirty kids --
L:  Yes.  Five of them sleep.
R:  Five of them sleep.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, that kind of thing.  And, you know, just kind of whatever for the -- for the quiz.  But, I think peop- -- kids are a lot more into it when it's right there --
L:  When they actually get --
R:  -- in front of them.  It's their --
L:  -- to push the buttons.
R:  It's at their control.  'Cause you give them -- you -- you -- it's almost like you're empowering them.  And, you know, whether they think of it like that or not.  But you're empowering them to learn themselves.  And it would just -- I think it's just much more interesting for kids.
L:  Right.  I mean, there's a lot of visual stuff involved, especially in geography.  This is what I was thinking you would say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because in -- I mean, there -- there has been all these studies, ah, around the world.  And it turns out that the American kids don't know where Afghanistan is, don't know where -- I don't know -- whatever --
R:  Anything is.
L:  China is. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, you know.  Forty two percent of American kids don't know where Afghanistan is, or, you know -- at the age of tw- -- eighteen --
