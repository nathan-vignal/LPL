R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Uh, my name's Pat.
R:  Uh, Molly.
L:  Pardon me?
R:  My name's Molly.
L:  Oh, hi Molly.
R:  Hi.
L:  Uh, we're supposed to talk about bio terrorism.  Could they pick a topic I didn't know any less about?
R:  [LAUGH] No, I don't think so --
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, it's, yeah.  Um, I'm not sure exactly what to say about that.
L:  Yeah, well, I'm not, ah, particularly worried about it, I think the media's blown it out of proportion to get a story, personally --
R:  Going after the wrong country, [inaudible] or the wrong people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think.  So.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems to me like the Bush's black war --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- more than anything.
L:  Yeah.  They seem, ah -- it seems to be a family heritage, doesn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Looks like it.
L:  [MN]
R:  Hm.  Is -- is this just a recorded conversation, is there any more questions, or is --
L:  No, I think that's -- that's our topic --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but, ah, we can probably talk about anything, they just need to [inaudible].
R:  Right.  I've never -- this is my first call.
L:  Yeah, mine too.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH].
R:  Sigh.  Ah, geeze, I don't know.  I guess they just give you a topic 'cause -- because they think that they need to give you some kind of -- something to talk about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't know if it's necessarily --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what we have to talk about.  I don't know.  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, I'm from Illinois.
R:  Michigan.
L:  Michigan?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  Oh.  Where in Michigan?
R:  Ah, Detroit.
L:  Oh, dear God.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean, it's like twenty minutes away from Detroit.
L:  Oh.  I was once lost in downtown Detroit, it was --
R:  Oh, that's bad.
L:  -- one of the worst experiences of my life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's --it's not good to get lost down there and asking for directions when you are lost is definitely is worse.
L:  We didn't ask for directions, we just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kept the eyes straight head, didn't point at anything, didn't talk --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- sweated a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's okay, though.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  I don't go downtown much.
L:  Yeah, it's not so bad when you live on the outskirts [several inaudible words].
R:  Right.  [MN]  It's not that bad.
L:  And I imagine there are good bits of Detroit.  I just never saw any of them.
R:  Yeah.  There's either decent parts or really bad.  It's -- yeah, I'm actually right next to Anne Arbour.
L:  Oh.
R:  Much better town than Detroit.
L:  Much better, yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm fairly close to Chicago, about an hour away from Chicago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's kind of nice, go into Chicago and get some culture.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Otherwise, I live in the middle of a cornfield in this college town.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm a college town, but not, um, not in no cornfields [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There aren't any cornfields.
L:  Yeah, well, I don't -- I envy you not having the cornfields --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm tired of them.  I'll have to get out the midwest some time, but --
R:  Yeah.  It's okay.  Hm.  I didn't know, I thought there was a like a survey, I thought that they would ask questions and then you just answer and they recorded --
L:  No, I think that the want a corpus of ah, ah, casual conversation although what they're going to end up with is a corpus of awkward conversations [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, really [LAUGH] I didn't know that we had to talk to other people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They called me about an hour ago and they had me on hold for like twenty minutes --
L:  Yeah, I was on hold for a while, too.  You'd think they would have just figured we were both on hold and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  So, I hung up and then they called me back.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what -- what do you do?
R:  I'm in school.
L:  Oh, me too.  Me too.  What are you studying?
R:  Um.  Sorry?
L:  What are you studying?
R:  Ah, graphic design.
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  Yeah.  I'm going to, um, community college right now, but I'm going to transfer to, um, it's an art school in Detroit.
L:  Oh.
R:  Next fall.
L:  Oh, excellent.
R:  Yeah.  What [inaudible] for?
L:  I'm, ah, sitting literature.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Ge- -- working on my PhD.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's extremely stressful, but --
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm sure it is.  I'm just like --
L:  My exams are in August?
R:  Mm?
L:  My exams are in August.
R:  In August?
L:  Yeah.  August I'm taking my exams, so now I'm, ah, preparing for those.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm going through my exams right now.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's not that bad.  I have easy classes right now [LAUGH].
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah, it's okay.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Hm.  What college do you go to?
L:  Ah, Northern Illinois University.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, it's, ah, it's -- it's not bad.  I like it.  A lot of people complain about it, but I think, you know, people complain about wherever they are.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I like it.
R:  And it's not, um, it's not to complain about school [LAUGH].
L:  Pardon me?
R:  It's not hard to complain about school.
L:  No, it certainly isn't [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I can always find something [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, really.  [SIGH] I don't know.  Mine's okay because I get to do my exams at home, well, for my art class anyways and my math class is actually a take home exam, too.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.  Not my English class, but that class is over with.  I'm good at spelling, that's about it.  You're going for literature, I'm definitely not a writer.
L:  Oh, well, I -- I do a bit of writing, I can't spell either, though, so --
R:  See, I'm a good speller, but I don't know -- I'm bad at writing.  I'm good at grammar, I just can't put the story together to, you know ...
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's not easy.  It -- there's -- there's no, you know, one way to do it, one formula and that makes it hard.
R:  Right.  My friend, she writes all the time.  It's definitely not my line. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  It's my line, I never have time to do it anymore.
R:  Yeah?
L:  So busy with grading papers and taking classes that --
R:  Yeah.  I think that's almost over.
L:  Is it, I don't know.  Are we supposed to time it or do they time it?
R:  Oh, no, no, [several inaudible words] school [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, school?
R:  Yeah.  Do they?  I don't know.  It's --
L:  Okay.  I thought you meant the conversation.  I -- I don't know.  If we're on a -- over ten minutes I think that we can probably disconnect, but I think they probably time us.
R:  Oh, probably.
L:  Yeah, so.
R:  I get ten bucks, so --
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm figuring.
R:  -- it's cool with me.
L:  That's why I'm sitting here.  I can use the money.  I'm -- I live in poverty right here -- right now, so --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I need the money too, Christmas is right here, not that it will be here before Christmas, actually --
L:  No.
R:  -- so -- do they send you -- you probably don't know -- a ten dollar check for the time, or do they just wait till it all --
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I don't know.  They probably wait till the end of the study.
R:  Yeah, maybe.
L:  That would be the easiest thing to do.  Bookkeeping wise, but ...
R:  So, th- -- they can call you up to how many times?
L:  Twenty five.
R:  Ooh, that's a lot of money.
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  They won't.
L:  I'm only scheduled for Saturdays, so I don't think I'm going to get anywhere near twenty five calls.
R:  Yeah, I'm scheduled for Saturdays and Sundays and I'm completely booked all during the week, so I didn't want them to call here when [SIGH] I wasn't here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't want to give them my work phone number.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That'd be bad.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I thought about it, too, because I -- I thought it was like a quick kind of survey, but --
L:  No, no, it's an actual conversation.
R:  I heard about this from my friend.  She's doing the same thing.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, my -- my department head sent out an email to everyone.  She's a linguist, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she's excited about it and then I told all my friends --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they're all broke.
R:  Yeah.  Fast money.
L:  Yeah.  Bio terrorism, where did they get these topics?
R:  I don't know.  I forget what it was last time when they called but -- because I couldn't accept it last weekend because, um, I didn't -- I never received my confirmation email --
L:  Yeah, same thing happened to me.
R:  So, I had to call and get the number and they kept calling me and calling me, they called me about ten times and I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I kept having to hang up on them.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  So --
L:  -- the same thing happened to me last week, so --
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I don't know if it was sent straight to my junk mail folder, or what.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was erased.  But I didn't see it.
L:  Well, they -- they -- it doesn't have a subject line, so my -- my program just automatically sent it to my junk --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- folder and I dug through it and found it, finally.
R:  Yeah.  See, mine automatically deletes after being in there for like two days.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, maybe it -- maybe it's three days, I'm not sure.  Either way, I didn't get it, so I had to call them and ask for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  Hopefully the bio terrorism thing doesn't happen.  I mean, got the -- we had the, um, [inaudible] towers, um, I'm not sure exactly how far it is, but they're on Lake Eire, so if they decide to hit those, we're going to -- I'm going to be out of luck.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That's twenty minutes away from here, twenty five minutes away from me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something like that.
L:  Well, you know, when September eleventh first happened, I did some research because everyone was talking about anthrax and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- although anthrax is pretty bad, it's not that bad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They'd need much better technology than they have to actually --
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, they got our planes, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not that the -- I mean, who knows?  They could do it again, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  I think it'd be a little harder now.  I think Americans won't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- won't up a hijacking anymore.  You know.
R:  Right.  True.  They'll probably try to fight them right away, you know, and, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know that they're not going to be getting off the plane [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, the used to tell us, just sit calm and --
R:  Yeah.  Do what they say.  Not any more.
L:  Right.  Not any more.  No.
R:  Don't do that.  Because, you know, they're -- kamikazes, you know, they're going to fly right into something.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  They're willing to die for it.
L:  -- it's better to take the chance it seems to me.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I see the one plane, um, the people did that, that's why it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- crashed, but who knows?
L:  Yeah.  Flight ND three I think it was.
R:  Yeah, something like that.  That crashed into that field.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I'm not too worried about bio terrorism.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't watch much TV so, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L: -- it could be that I'm not indoctrinated to worry about.
R:  Right.  I, ah, well, I mean, I don't -- I don't worry about it too much, yeah, I'm not following the news completely.  I think that Bush is taking it a little bit too far and he's trying to be the hero, but he's going after -- I mean, maybe they do have, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- plans on --
L:  But I -- 
R:  -- sending a bomb over here or something, but --
L:  I think Bush has completely lost his mind.
R:  I think he has, too.  And no one's with us, so, you know --
L:  Well, right, the -- the international community's looking at us like [MN] we're a bunch of cowboys, which we are --
R:  Well, we are, that's what he is.  You know.  That's what -- that's what he is.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  He's a cowboy.  He's -- we all -- you know, we always want to be the top of everything, we want to get in everyone's business and we think -- we associated the end of the world with planes hitting our World Trade Center, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what's that mean?  How many countries does this happen to?  But when it -- when it happens to us, it --
L:  Then it's a disaster.
R:  It's a sign of the apocalypse?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Who cares about our buildings, you know?
L:  Well, you know, it is a definite national tragedy, but --
R:  Definitely, but apocalypse?  Come on.
L:  No.
R:  No way.
L:  No.
R:  The end of the world.
L:  The world's going to keep on grinding, I think.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We don't get out of it that easy [LAUGH].
R:  No, you know.  And I'm not falling for all that stuff.  I -- and I really -- I really don't like Bush.
L:  Oh, I despise the man.  I -- I -- I can't even watch him on TV.  It literally makes me ill.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Makes my stomach hurt.
R:  Well, Republicans, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't vote for him.
R:  No.  I didn't either.
