L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  My name --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is Tom Sh-  
L:  Hello, Tom.  Hi, I'm Jen. [NOISE] 
R:  Hi Jen.
L:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  Where are you calling from?  Or, where are --
R:  Um.
L:  -- you being called from, I guess?
R:  Boca Raton.
L:  Oh -- oh.  That sounds fun. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in New York. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, but we're supposed to be talking about pets, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Do you have a pet?
R:  Yeah I do.  I have a dog actually.
L:  Oh yeah?  What kind of dog?
R:  Yeah, he's a, um -- he's a mix --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of  at least four or five kinds.  He's got some Westie in him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, some cocker spaniel, and a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- little bit of poodle.
L:  Oh, lovely.
R:  You know, which is very good.  It means he doesn't shed. [SIGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, do you have a pet?
L:  Um, I do not, but my roommate has a pet, so --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- I -- I guess I have, like, a pet by proxy or something.  Um, and this pet does shed.  It's [LAUGH] -- it's, I think, a black lab and maybe there's something else mixed in with it.  And, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  Really cute dog.  Its name is Cassie.  Um, and she's just, like, an adorable dog, but there's -- there's hair everywhere. [LAUGH]  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Black hair is --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- everywhere in the apartment.  [NOISE] 
R:  Ah, that's -- that's, ah, tough. [LAUGH]  You know --
L:  Yeah.  It's a weakness[?].
R:  We're very -- we're very lucky with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Had -- and so your roommate has the dog?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And how old is he or she?
L:  Ah, the room mate or the dog? [LAUGH] Uh --
R:  Nah.  How old is the dog?
L:  Yeah, ah, the dog is, um -- it's a couple of years old.  I think two or three he said.  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Ver good.  We've had our dog for a good ten years or so.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Oh wow.
R:  Already.  So, he's getting -- getting old and getting --
L:  Really?
R:  -- slow.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's sad.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, wh- what is your pet's name?
L:  Sorry? [NOISE] 
R:  What is your pet's name?
L:  Oh, the dog's name is Cassie.  I guess short for Cassandra maybe.
R:  Oh okay.  Is -- is -- was that just -- just something -- up?
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm not sure how she got the name actually.
R:  [MN] Okay.  -- rescued our dog from the street.
L:  Oh really?  Well that's nice.
R:  So, consequently he, ah -- he goes by the name of Lucky.
L:  Lucky, oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Because if he'd been out there any longer he probably would've died, which is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which is kind of good news for him, I guess.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  Definitely. [NOISE] 
R:  But, ah, there you go.  So -- so, wh- what do you enjoy most about the pet?  About -- this is a dog or a cat?
L:  It's a dog.
R:  It's a dog.  Okay.  I'm s- --
L:  Ah, well, I think -- I mean, living in New York City, the security is nice, um.  Because, you know, the dog, when I come in is always, you know, right at the door.  And of course she recognizes me, so, you know, I get let in.  But, I imagine if, ah, I was not someone that she recognized [NOISE] then she would not let me in. [LAUGH]  So, um -- so, it's nice to have kind of, like a big dog with a -- you know, and she's of course totally sweet and would never, um, hurt me or her owner.  But, she can bark when -- when called upon to do so. And so, she's probably a nice, um, deterrent to criminals, um.  So, that's a nice practical thing about the dog.  But, ah --
R:  Oh.  Very good[?].
L:  She's also really cute.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]  So, living in the city, I guess you don't really have much space to exercise her or ...?  Or -- or are you close to one of the parks?
L:  Ah, yeah.  There's a dog run.  We're in, um -- we're -- I don't know if you know New York City geography at all, but we're year -- near, um, Union Square, where there's a dog run --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in a park, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  So that's really good, yeah.
L:  So, there are places, yeah, where they can go socialize and run around.
R:  Yeah.  Th- that's cool.  Yeah, I know -- I know the city quite well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Although I'm not sure that, ah, I'd like to live there, I don't think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I've gotten too used to the, ah -- too used to the sunshine. [LAUGH]     
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, very good.  Yeah, we have, um -- we have, ah, down here -- we actually live out in the country, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We're -- we're out -- out in the west, almost out in the Everglades.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we've got plenty of room and he gets to go out and run quite a lot.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Although he just -- although he doesn't run very far --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is a -- which is a good thing, [NOISE] for us at least anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um [LIPSMACK] -- oh, very good.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yo-  -- um, do [MN] -- I guess that in being a big dog, does that kind of give a problem in the apartments, or?
L:  Um, not really.  Ah, I mean, it's a small apartment of course, but, um -- but the dog pretty much stays in my roommate's side of the apartment, um.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And the -- I don't know.  Maybe she finds it crowding, but -- but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the humans [LAUGH] in the apartment are okay with it.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good.  'Cause we kind of --
L:  But h- -- oh --
R:  Sorry.
L:  I'm sorry. [LAUGH] 
R:  Go ahead.
L:  I was going to say your dog is, ah -- I know y- -- poodle you mentioned was one of the mix.  Is it a small dog?
R:  Yeah, well it, ah -- I'm sorry?
L:  Is it a very small dog, or a medium sized --
R:  Oh yeah.  He's about thirty five pounds.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, kind of runs everywhere and gets on very well with the -- with the baby and everything else, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.  Great.
R:  Which is really good, you know.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That was probably the -- probably my worst fear actually, because we've had him a long time and then when -- when the baby came along -- he's now two of course, so --
L:  Oh, right -- right.
R:  -- not such a baby any more.  But, um, [NOISE] it, uh -- they now get on very well, which is good.
L:  Great -- great. [NOISE] 
R:  So, that works out very well.  But, um, yeah, it was kind [NOISE] of interesting -- yeah, him -- him not being large is -- is a good thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In that respect.
L:  Great.
R:  I can imagine he would just run over a small child if he were any -- you know, much bigger.
L:  Oh, yeah. [SIGH]
R:  Being friendly.  I'm not sure -- [MN] not quite sure.  I used to have boxers, ah --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.
R:  -- which are a -- a big dog.  A long time ago when I was back in, ah -- back in the UK.  But, um, so that was kind of entertaining.  Ah, but, they're a se- -- you know, they make very, ah -- they're a likeable dog too, so they enjoy socializing with, ah, people and other animals.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah, ah, I had, um -- growing up, ah -- I mean, it wasn't too long ago, I'm only twenty three.  So, [LAUGH] it's not, like, years and years ago.  But, ah, but growing up in New Jersey we had a beagle, and the beagle had puppies, so there were many beagles at one point and, um, they were fun.  They were always very sweet to me and my brother, but, um, they would kind of, like, [SIGH] chew on things every so often.  I think I lost a few dolls to [LAUGH] to the beagles.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um -- but they were quite nice.
R:  Yeah.  The -- the boxers didn't necessarily chew, although they dribbled on everything, which was --
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, yeah, you know, that was -- I guess that's just a -- a thing with the breed.  I -- you -- you either live with it or you don't.
L:  Right -- right.
R:  But, um, you know, it worked out very well.  M- he was a great dog and then, ah, the follower was also a great dog.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they did very well.  But, um, no -- so, it -- I can imagine that, um, beagles -- my wife's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- parents had a beagle --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for a while.  And he was supposedly a bit of a psycho.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] in terms of attitude -- a very, um, highly strung apparent- --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Which I don't know if that's in the br- or not.
L:  Hm.  Well, I think they have to -- I think beagles, because they're hounds, they have to sort of, like, stay[?] and just -- like, they have to have tasks or something.  I -- maybe this is just people that I know spouting off about something they don't know about, but they have to, um, have lots of activity and th- -- I mean, they do cabin fever quite easily, so if they're kind of in a house and they don't have anything to chase or chew or think about, then they'll go kind of crazy.  But, um -- but, I mean, we never had any problems with ours. [PAUSE]  Hello? [PAUSE]  Okay.
