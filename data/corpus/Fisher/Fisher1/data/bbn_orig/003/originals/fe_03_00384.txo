R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Falahad.
L:  And my name in Ari.
R:  Hi Ari.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine, thanks you.  How are you?
R:  I'm doing fine, thank you very much.
L:  Great.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So the topic is Middle East, isn't it?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, it's -- it's going to be a very interesting topic, because I -- I'm a Middle Eastern myself.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's funny. [LAUGH] And, but I came here in nineteen sixty two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As a student.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it happened that I married an American woman.
L:  Oh, why[?]?
R:  And we have two children and two grandchildren.
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Very good.
R:  Yes.  And, ah, so, [LAUGH] I have no -- you -- w- when you are Middle Eastern you are very much interested in what's happening --
L:  What's happening over there, right?
R:  Yes.  Over that area.
L:  Yes.  I guess -- I would imagine so.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's -- it's -- it's quite a lot happening over there, right?
R:  It's quite a lot happening --
L:  Yes -- yes.
R:  -- over there.  So --
L:  Quite.
R:  Is there anything, ah, special about Middle East you would like to know, or you w- [LAUGH] 
L:  Well --
R:  What's happening -- what's happening down there?
L:  Well, I -- I -- I -- you just -- you tell me, ah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  I can -- I can start by just giving you some of my feelings about it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, you know, what's -- I think what's happening in the Middle East right now is part of a big movement --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- by, I think -- by Islamic fundamentalism.
L:  Okay.
R:  That's my -- my feeling.
L:  Your feeling.
R:  Because I have Muslim background myself.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I'm not a practicing Muslim.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, what is happening is that they want to claim what they lost in, ah, early part of this century.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's probably around nineteen twenty.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Ottoman Empire was overthrown and all the Middle East was subdivision into different countries.  So, ah, what you -- what you see is the resurg- I see -- what you see is the +resurgence.  You see it everywhere.
L:  All right.
R:  In the -- in the -- in the Middle East.
L:  In the Mid-
R:  And I mean, extended beyond Middle East too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, there are -- there are probably -- I mean, everything that is Western be- is being questioned.  Everything.
L:  Everyth- okay.
R:  Everything.  I mean, no -- no matter -- I mean, what it is.  It's in culture, music, people, ah, behaviors.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Anything is being questioned. 
L:  Okay.
R:  And, ah, what -- what you see is that they're -- they're -- they're -- [SIGH] they're in no way going to, ah -- how should -- how should I say it?  To come to, ah, term.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I really --
R:  No?
L:  No.  I really don't think that, ah, peace will be -- not any time really soon.  I really don't --
R:  And I --
L:  -- think so.
R:  I don't see either because, you know it's -- it's -- it's very -- it's very, ah, militant.
L:  Right.
R:  It's not -- it's not -- I mean, you don't see it in any element of -- okay, now let's sit down and talk and --
L:  Right.
R:  And come halfway -- halfway -- halfway.
L:  Um, let's -- let's -- let's negotiate it and try to meet halfway.
R:  There is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think there is any way --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that it -- I mean, it's possible. I -- I --
L:  No.
R:  I know people are very emotional.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And people, ah, basically have set ideas.
L:  Right.
R:  And [LAUGH] --
L:  They want to -- everybody's right, right?
R:  They want -- [MN] and they think they're absolutely right.
L:  Yes -- yes.
R:  And they think the causes -- causes of all their problems is the, eh, domination by West.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um.  Okay, as far as I -- I'm concerned, I think -- I don't believe in these things.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that, ah, culturally, ah, West and the Middle East are two different entities.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's not because of the West that the Middle East isn't developed to be, ah -- pro- I mean, progressive.  I mean, you know, you see countries like Singapore --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and Taiwan, Japan, South Korea.  You see them come out of, ah, big problems and then they kind of developed into self supporting and progressive countries.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, you can not find any of these in the Middle East.
L:  In the Middle East.
R:  No -- no.  It's just -- it's always the -- they always shoot themselves in the feet.  They're sitting on -- on one of the biggest oil resources --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  But, at the same time, these resources cannot be used into, ah, developing an -- I mean, economically and socially --
L:  Social, hm.
R:  -- and cult- I mean, yeah.  It's -- it's a very -- very -- very -- very difficult situation.  That's -- that's my understanding of -- of the --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, of the situation in the Middle East.  Yes. [LAUGH]   
L:  Right.  Well, I -- I really -- I kind of agree with you because I -- I definitely don't feel that there's any peace that's any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- time soon.  In -- in -- probably in my lifetime.
R:  No.
L:  Ah.
R:  No.
L:  I just don't see them reaching, you know --
R:  It's -- it's very -- it's almost -- I mean, it's almost difficult to even imagine that, ah, you c- you can have a protracted settlement of peace.  I mean, look at Israel and -- and -- and Palestine.
L:  And that's right.
R:  Because, I mean, the Palestinians and the -- I mean, most of the Arab countries -- I mean, although, um, um, um, in negotiations --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or in the United Nations --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they talk about the right of the Israelis.
L:  Right.
R:  In private, they don't -- they do not believe in that.
L:  I know.
R:  The whole [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's -- it's absolute in -- I mean, dis- destruction of the -- I mean, state of Israel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's the plan.  And, you know, I -- my wife and I were in Iran in nineteen seventy eight 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to seventy -- I mean, to eighty.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When the Islamic fundamentalists came to power.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, the number one foreign policy they put for themselves was to li- the liberation of Jer-, um, Jerusalem.
L:  Mm.
R:  That was the -- the number one foreign --
L:  Number one priority, uh?
R:  Yes.  And having all these -- you know, having all these fundamentalist countries around Israel, how could you [LAUGH] -- I mean, how could you --
L:  How could you?
R:  -- bring up peace?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.  If -- if -- actually it's a mess, you know.
R:  It is a mess.
L:  It really --
R:  [LAUGH] It is a mess, yes.
L:  It's terrible.
R:  It is.  In a -- in a way it's sad, you know, to see --
L:  It's sad.
R:  -- I mean, the situation like this.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, at the same time --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- ah, you have to hope for -- I mean, for -- hope for some time, you know, in future that people's understandings will develop. [LAUGH]
L:  We would hope they would.
R:  I hope so too.
L:  But, it's -- it's really -- right now it doesn't seem as if that's going to happen.  And especially now that -- I mean, we're so involved and want to start -- you know, we're going over for the war and all this stuff.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it really, ah -- I don't see any peace.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's -- it's sad.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I see -- I -- yeah.  Definitely.
L:  You know, it's --
R:  Um --
L:  It's -- it's really terrible and, ah --
R:  It's very -- really ter- terrible.  I mean, tak-
L:  You hate to see this happen because you don't like, ah -- there's just too many lives.
R:  Too many lives are --
L:  Yes.
R:  Too many lives are being taken.
L:  That's right. 
R:  That's true.
L:  Yes.
R:  Ah, th- this is the peace time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It's supposed to be a peace --
R:  Yeah.  It's supposed to be [inaudible] peace time, yeah.
L:  It should be, but it's not.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  Too many, ah -- and we are going to war.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, in -- in -- I remember again [MN] in nineteen eighty Iraq invaded Iran.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and -- I mean, on both sides -- sides of -- both sides, probably about five hundred thousand people were killed.
L:  Yeah.  And that's terrible, you know.
R:  And --
L:  That's -- that's really, ah --
R:  Yeah.  Bu- but -- yeah.  Nine years later Iraq invaded Kuwait.
L:  Yes.
R:  And we don't know how many people --
L:  How many people.
R:  It's --
L:  And then there's Afghanistan.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's -- it's everywhere, you know.  
R:  How [MN] 
L:  Now, with Iraq it's -- it's -- it's o- it's continual.  It continues.
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  And it's sad. 
R:  It is very sad.
L:  It's so many -- there's too many innocent people.  Too many people who really don't want it -- it's -- are losing their lives.
R:  That's true.  That's really true, yes.
L:  And it shouldn't be.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- you know, basically the -- the innocent people who are getting hurt.
L:  Yes -- yes.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It -- it shouldn't be.
R:  Do -- do you have any fri- any Middle Eastern friends, or ?
L:  I do, yes.
R:  You do?
L:  As a matter of fact, ah, Wanda got me involved in this survey.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  And, it -- it --as a matter -- I think she's -- she not an instructor, but she teaches, ah -- she's involved in the University of Penn.
R:  Okay.  I see -- I see what you mean.
L:  And who else --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- do I know? 
R:  [MN] At the same time, you know, almost everyone from Middle East --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- has a different opinion about this. [LAUGH] 
L:  About -- yes.
R:  [LAUGH] It's not that people share the same -- the same view.
L:  That's true -- the same views.  And I guess that's -- that's --
R:  [MN] Everybody has their own in- I mean --
L:  Yeah.  Everybody has their own opinion.  
R:  Opinion, yeah.
L:  And I guess that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- being --
R: [NOISE] 
L:  -- whatever.  'Cause I guess we should.
R:  You see that's true.  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, that comes wi- there comes a time when you really have to look at what's -- what -- what -- what you feel is right though, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Sure.
L:  You know?
R:  Sure.  Definitely.  How --
L:  So, you -- you have to really sit down and --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, look at your -- I mean, listen to your conscience and --
L:  Yes -- yes.  Yeah.
R:  And see -- I mean, see what you're supporting and what you're no- I mean. Here [MN] --
L:  That's right.  See, you know, yo- you have to really -- not what you've been brought up as, but what you really know for yourself is --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- what's right.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And --
R:  People -- people -- people, by themselves are very peaceful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's only the -- I mean, special interests.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, these -- these -- gov- governments in the Middle East -- I mean, they're sitting on the -- I mean, the biggest resou- I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Natural resou- -- I mean, oil resources.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I mean, they -- they should be able to utilize that for the betterment --
L:  That's --
R:  -- of the people.
L:  That's right.  For the people.
R:  And -- and you don't see that.
L:  Nope.
R:  [LAUGH] You don't -- 
L:  Selfish.
R:  You don't see that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Well, they -- you know, this is -- this is -- you have to stop and -- people have to stop and -- and look at what's really going on.  You know?
R:  That's -- that's true.
L:  What's -- what's -- what the common denominator is there.
R:  That's true.
L:  And not what -- what someone else is just telling you.
R:  That's true.
L:  So.
R:  Yes, ma'am.
L:  Maybe one day.
R:  One -- maybe hope for the one day.
L:  Yeah.  Hopefully --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:   -- one day.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know when.
R:  That's true.
L:  But, hopefully one day things -- things --
