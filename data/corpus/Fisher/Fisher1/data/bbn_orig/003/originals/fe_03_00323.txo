R:  Hi, my name is Nadine.
L:  Hi, Nadine.  My name is Lorraine.  How are you?
R:  Nice to meet you.  Good.  Good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I guess we're just supposed to talk about this now, just introduce ourselves and then talk about perjury?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Okay.  I guess, um, so I just had to look up what perjury means --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because I couldn't [LAUGH] what it meant.  So, I went to the dictionary.  I mean, do you -- do you know what it means, or could you --
L:  Well, I think if you're, you know, in Court and you're taking an oath, you're supposed -- you're not supposed to lie.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, ah, if you do, you're perjuring yourself.
R:  So, what do you think?  Do you think you would, ah, do that for a friend or family member?
L:  Um, that's really tough, I mean I guess it depends on the severity of the issue, I mean, if I'm in Court and, you know, I'm asked to take an oath, I'd -- I'd like to say that I wouldn't, um, but if it's my best friend or my mother or my -- one of my sisters and I knew that, you know, in my heart of hearts they were- -- didn't mean to do anything wrong --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- maybe I would.  I don't know.  I've never been in that situation before.
R:  I know.  I know.  I haven't either.  I mean, I'm thinking like, it would probably be hardest if it was a child of yours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because then you would feel like, especially responsible for making sure that that child doesn't go -- go to jail or -- or worse.
L:  That's true.  I mean, I know in my day to day, like, little things, I've said like little white lies and told people, "Oh, yeah, I love your outfit" when I think it looks absolutely awful [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I know what you're talking about.
L:  But does that count?
R:  No, I don't think that counts [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, I've done the same, you know, or at least like if someone asks you a question, like, "Do I look fat?" or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, whatever, I mean usually I'll try to like do what I can not to hurt their feelings or --
L:  [MN] Both of my sisters are overweight and they always ask me, "Do I look fat in this?" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, why are you asking me that?
R:  I know, I know.  I have a few friends like that, too.  And personally I just went up a jeans size recently --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like over the last, like, six months, so, um --
L:  It's wintertime, it's okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess so, but --
L:  It always happens.
R:  I just hope it doesn't go up another size [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- now that it's Christmastime, I'll have to be really careful about that.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, so of course, then, you know, I have to quiz my boyfriend all the time, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- are you sure that you haven't noticed anything?  And, and see if, ah -- but, you know, he's very good, if he's like probably committing perjury everytime he tells me this --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I don't mind.  You know [LAUGH].
L:  Sometimes you just need to be told what you want to hear.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  There's nothing wrong with that.  So, what else are we supposed to talk about?  Can we just -- are we just chatting for like ten minutes?  I had a friend that did this --
L:  Mhm.  I -- I think what you're supposed to talk about the topic that they gave us --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so that -- I assume so they can get as much, um --
R:  Of our --
L:  -- language that we use about that particular topic.
R:  Yeah.  How did you hear about this study?
L:  Well, I actually, um, work for a publishing company that deals with reference products and language products and stuff like that and, ah, that's how we got interested in it.  So, we all ended up --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- signing up, thought that it would be really exciting to contribute --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, this is actually my very first call.
R:  Oh, me, too.  Too.
L:  And I just walked in the door [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I -- I just got home like twenty minutes ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I got first a call and then th- --the, um, machine actually hung up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I guess, and then it called right back and I was like, oh, cool, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I'm trying to think of what else we can talk about with perjury.  Um --
L:  Ah -- 
R:  I'm trying to think if there's any, ah, um --
L:  Maybe we should make up a scenario --
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  -- and pretend, you know, as if we're in Court and see what you would actually do.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  All right.  Since it's my idea, maybe I should make something up [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.  All right.  Here's a good case.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I cannot stand my best friend's boyfriend.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah -- I am --
R:  That's typical.
L:  At all.  He's a terrible person, he's an absolutely terrible person.  It's not just because, you know, we've been best friends for over a decade and nobody's good enough for her, that's not it.  I mean, he's a really, really terrible person.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I always imagine myself, like, you know, I don't know, making sure that he disappears from the face of the earth and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things like that.  So, let's pretend, you know, for the sake of the discussion, that, you know, he did disappear and I knew about his whereabouts and, you know, I had a discussion with him and I told him never to contact, you know, my best friend again and la, la, la and I made him feel extremely guilty, so he didn't.  And, you know, my best friend hasn't heard from him in days and she asks me what's going on.
R:  Hm.
L:  She has like this strange inkling that I may know what's going on, I haven't talked to her in a long time about the relationship between her and, you know, her boyfriend, he's just taken off, they didn't have an argument, nothing happened.  What do I say to her?
R:  You know what --
L:  And I'm starting to feel a little guilty.
R:  Right.  Of course.  You know what, if he's really that terrible, like, if it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I'm serious.  Like, if it's not just because you're, you know, you were jealous of their relationship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, because I know how it is when you have a friend of yours -- I had a friend of mine that was dating a very horrible -- I mean, I -- I hated him.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, they got a puppy together, he was abusive to the dog --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was very upsetting.  She was a friend of mine forever and she actually, ah, she ended up marrying him and -- and they have a ten month old and he just walked out like three months ago for no reason.  So --
L:  I'm not surprised.
R:  Yeah.  So, maybe --
L:  It's kind of like something this guy would do.  Like he's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gone away for days, not called her, not said where he is and then later on shows up, totally apologetic and she just takes him back.
R:  You know, I -- as far as I'm concerned, if you were to do something like that for her, then that would be a good thing.  You know --
L:  I think so, too.
R:  You know.  Get rid of him.  Get him out of the picture.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Unfortunately, though, you know how it is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, like it -- it takes two to have an abusive relationship --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or to have a bad relationship, so they're both like, they're both coming back -- I'm a psychologist -- they're both coming --
L:  Mhm [LAUGH].
R:  -- for something, you know, they're both getting something out of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Out of that relationship.  So --
L:  I think I would feel so guilty, b- -- I mean, because we've been best friends for thirteen years.  I mean, how could I be so dishonest with her?
R:  [MN]
L:  And is it going to come to bite me in the end?
R:  Well, it's not like you killed him.
L:  No.
R:  You know, what I mean?
L:  No.
R:  You just killed the relationship.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And maybe that's a good thing.  I mean, the -- the relationship will come back to bite her in the end.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not like if somebody is like, you know, got a commitment problem that it's like a little light switch they can just turn off and on --
L:  Yeah.  And they have a daughter together, they're not married, but, you know, they have a daughter and --
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  -- he's just a really bad partner.
R:  Well, then, that -- that's tough.  Then you really -- you -- then, then, hm, because once kids are involved, then things get a little more tricky.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because you really -- you know, you don't want to break up the family --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- however, she could always find another nice guy.
L:  I think so.
R:  You know.
L:  [MN] I don't know.  It's a tough call.  I -- I really don't know what I would do in that situation, like sometimes I'd [inaudible] like just call him up -- I mean, I'm not close with him at all, obviously -- and none of our circle of friends are, nobody likes him, her family doesn't like him, nobody.  And sometimes I feel like calling him up and saying, "You know, what's going on with you?  How could you -- how could you do this to her?  Like, how could you be so selfish?" and --
R:  You know what he would do.  He would get all angry at you on the phone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He would tell her and then your friendship with her would be temporarily over.
L:  Yeah.  But I feel like --
R:  You know what --
L:  -- I mean, he has to be like human in someway that I could talk to him and then I don't know, trigger some kind of -- forcing him to like think about the relationship, think about what he's doing to her and like get up and take care of his own life and leave.
R:  You know, Lorraine.  He sounds like he just doesn't care.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And also, sometimes some people like, like maybe that's all he has to give.  Like maybe he really is like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doing the best that he knows how to do.  I mean, like I don't know if you know anything about his like background or his upbringing or anything like that --
L:  Yeah.  His father was an alcoholic, his parents divorced when they young, I mean --
R:  Okay.  So, he doesn't even know how to like having a loving -- like, he's never had any kind of model --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of what a loving relationship is, or --
L:  I don't think that's good enough, though [LAUGH].
R:  No.  I agree.
L:  Like, too bad for him, because they've tried for three years and she's done -- bent over backwards for the guy and everything.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's -- that's just -- that's very sad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially, like I said, when kids are involved because it's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- it's not as, ah, cut and dry.
L:  Exactly.  And I feel like in that situation that I -- maybe I would be able to lie about it.
R:  Yeah.  It would just be nice if he really went away for good [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Without my having anything to do with it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he probably wouldn't.  He'd probably come back around and, you know, try to ruin your friendship with her.
L:  I wouldn't doubt it.
R:  And it sounds like you're like such a strong connection for her --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, like you're a really good support.
L:  Oh.
R:  It sounds like, to me at least, from -- even the fact that you would bring this up on this conversation [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, we've been friends since high school, like I went on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, family vacations with her and, you know, her parents and things like that, we're very, very close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's very tough.  Um, I -- I don't even know.  I mean, I -- I think that in those kinds of cases, if -- if you're -- if you have to lie to get rid of him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or get rid of whatever --
L:  For the greater good, you do it.
R:  Exactly.  [COUGH] Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um -- and she --
L:  I feel kind of guilty saying that on the phone, you know, that this is being recorded and people are going to listen to it later on and they're going to hear that, you know, what if we really had to, we would do it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  It's okay to say it to a stranger, but then to know that later on people are going to listen, it'll be like, wow, those girls are bad [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Everyone has been, you know, everyone would do the same thing.  I'm sure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when -- it's when you really care about somebody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you really, like, had their best interests at heart.
L:  Yeah.  And I guess of course it always depends on the situation.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- that's true.  I mean, I'm trying to think of a situation where I would definitely commit perjury, um, I mean I have a little brother that's had like a lot of, ah, he's had some run ins with the law --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but over like the stupidest things.  Like, he got arrested for having a fake ID.  My parents had to bail him --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- out of jail.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Like, if -- if -- if you can get arrested -- if it's the stupidest thing that you could possibly get arrested for, he'll get arrested for it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, it's just so outrageous.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, he also lives in like a town where there's not a lot of crime --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's, ah, you know, a very small town and so the cops just kind of come out of the woodwork and they're just like, they want to bust these young guys for, like, just crazy things.
L:  Because they have nothing better to do.
R:  [COUGH] Exactly.  So, if they put --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- me on the stand --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about some of this stuff that he's gotten arrested for, I would -- I would lie for him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I would --
L:  Because you know it's all silly and that he has a good heart.
R:  Yeah.  And I would just be like, why are you wasting tax payers' dollars?  Who cares if this person has a fake ID?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I mean, to me, if you're eighteen, I think you should be allowed to drink in this country.  I don't [COUGH] I don't understand the big deal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like, you can go off and fight in a war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and get killed, but I mean, if you're -- if you are graduated from colle- -- or high school and you don't have to continue anymore of your education, like, you should just be allo- -- I mean, you're an adult.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't understand what the big hangup is.
L:  That's true.
R:  I mean, drinking and driving is completely different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, that's -- that's a completely different issue, but I mean, he's never been arrested for anything like that.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  So, then I would lie.  So [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or commit perjury, I suppose is the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the --
L:  Perjure yourself.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.
L:  But then there's also consequences that -- that you may have to suffer.  Your lie could be found out.  And then what?
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  You get thrown out of Court, or you get arrested yourself --
R:  What happens?  Yeah, what happens if you commit perjury?
