L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And it was for Time in Europe.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]   
R:  And it had the question --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who do you think is the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- greatest threat to, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- war.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Ah, who's the great -- who's the greatest threat for war, and it listed North Korea and the United States and Iraq.  And who do you think --
L:  Oh, rea--
R:  -- came out at the top of that list?
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] Take a guess. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, ah.
R:  [LAUGH] People voted --
L:  Ah, America? [LAUGH] 
R:  It was. [LAUGH]  
L:  It was? [LAUGH]
R:  Seventy two percent of the people voted [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- that America was the greatest danger to world peace at this time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wasn't that interesting?
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what are your thoughts on what's going on?
L:  Ah, I'm sorry?
R:  What are your thoughts on what's going on over there?
L:  Um, oh [LAUGH] -- oh, it, um -- I -- I -- this morning I was watching, um, ah, the, [MN] [NOISE] -- is it Good Morning, [NOISE] ah -- [NOISE] Good Morning America?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Um, oh this, ah, [NOISE] nothing.  [inaudible] is facing, um, [NOISE] Saudi [NOISE] -- is it [NOISE] Saudi [NOISE] +Arabia? [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.   Yeah, um, [NOISE] I -- [MN] [NOISE] it impressed [NOISE] me, the -- the -- the lady who [NOISE] was [NOISE] interviewed.  [NOISE] Um, sh- [NOISE] she said it -- [NOISE] yeah, this should be [NOISE] -- you know, [NOISE] kept out of the [LAUGH], you know.  But, ah, there, um, are like[?] -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- a lot of things.  You know, um, some things [NOISE] -- their religion -- like, um, we -- we should put, [NOISE] um, ourself on [NOISE] their shoes. [NOISE] I -- I -- really -- I don't know. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we should --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- put ourselves in their shoes? 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  That what they were saying?
L:  Yeah.  Um, [NOISE] I mean, 'cause, ah, [NOISE] this, um, [NOISE] -- this, ah, [NOISE] -- I -- I [NOISE] forgot her name [NOISE] -- and she's [NOISE] a -- famous, um, um, [NOISE] ah, hostess.  [NOISE]  And she [NOISE] asked, um, "What do you think, [NOISE] ah -- you know, you're covered all up in public [NOISE], and [NOISE] how do you express [NOISE] your, um, [NOISE] you know, um, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] you know, personality?" or [NOISE] something like that.  [NOISE] And then, [NOISE] um, they said, [NOISE] "This is our religion".  [NOISE] [LAUGH] And, uh, [NOISE] -- it -- it [LAUGH] -- I mean some [NOISE] -- this is just an example. [NOISE] Sometimes we [NOISE] -- we -- [NOISE] we think about [NOISE] other people in our own way, and then [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] -- I don't know.  I -- I -- I mean [NOISE] -- I don't -- I don't know the sort of political [NOISE] things, but I think we should give them [NOISE] some, um, [NOISE] space [NOISE].  Yes -- yes, fine.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] You've got a little one.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, you're saying that, um --
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause I -- I don't like, um, a war, totally. [NOISE]  Yeah, and, um, [NOISE] I don't know.  I don't understand [NOISE] why -- I don't understand why we [NOISE] should attack, um, [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.  I don't --
L:  -- Iraq. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I don't either.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I don't either.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I really don't get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it.
L:  [NOISE] I don't get it, yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  It seems like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's something going on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at some level, that, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we don't know --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- about. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  'Cau- yeah, there -- yeah.  
R:  We're missing some details. 
L:  It's something maybe we never -- will never know, but, um, [NOISE] I don't know. [NOISE] Um, I -- I don't [NOISE] like war. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't like it at all either.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Very hoping it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- never happens, but --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I read in the paper --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yesterday --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hoping to have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  a hundred and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fifty thousand troops over there by --
L:  [NOISE] By?
R:  By the middle --
L:  Of March?
R:  -- of February.  Yeah.
L:  February?  Oh.  [MN] [NOISE] Ooh.
R:  Yeah.  They just keep sending, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, twenty -- thirty thousand of them over there a week.
L:  Oh why?  [NOISE] I mean -- I mean -- in common sense -- I mean, [NOISE] [LAUGH] this is not our business. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  Doesn't seem like it, does it?  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] this far from us. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's why I like that -- that little website that someone sent me for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the Time Europe survey.
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, you know, we don't -- we don't get that survey over here.  But this was over in Europe.  And it's, like --
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh. 
R:  -- what the rest of the world is thinking of this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and saying, "Yeah, we know --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who's the bigger threat --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to world peace". [NOISE] 'Cause --" 
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- who's pushing for this war?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's us --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unfortunately, here in America.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, this morning, this, um -- this, ah, +Saudi woman -- yeah, she saying um, US like, um, you know, a -- a police-, ah, policeman. [LAUGH]  International policeman, you know.
R:  Right.  And who -- who gave us the right to do that?  I -- I --
L:  I know.  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get it.
L:  You know, we have to [NOISE] pay the tax, um, for -- for stuff like the, you know, [LAUGH] ammunitions, and you know, manpower.  All [NOISE] those things.
R:  Right -- right.  That's the only that makes me happy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I'm low income right now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If I was middle income I would've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- been paying all the tax for this.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh -- oh.
R:  This really would've ticked me off.
L:  Uh-huh.  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  'Cause I don't want to pay for this war.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah -- yeah.  
R:  You know, I just don't.
L:  I mean, [NOISE] nobody -- I -- I think nobody wants to. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Why should we have to?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so far, there doesn't seem to be much choice.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  I mean, I keep -- you know, I have a lot of websites that I go out to that I -- you know, I sign petitions.  I do all that stuff. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh. 
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I haven't seen it make any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- difference yet.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And, um, [NOISE] I saw [NOISE] a lot of people post, ah, [NOISE] signs on, [NOISE] ah, -- yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, honey -- in their front yards as a -- you know, th- -- all against the war. [NOISE]
R:  In Seattle?
L:  [NOISE] In Seattle.  Yeah.
R:  You're seeing that?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  In Seattle you're seeing that?
L:  In Seat- yeah, in Seattle.
R:  I don't see too much of that here in Boulder.  You'd think you'd see more of it here.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But, actually they're trying to get the city council here --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- to, um, make a declaration that we don't support the war.
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh.   
R:  So, that's what they're doing here.
L:  I -- I wonder if, ah, we can make any difference. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, the City Council wants to -- you know, people are --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- urging the City Council to, like, make --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a statement that the City of Boulder --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- does not support this war.
L:  Yeah.  They sure should try. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] know what difference it'll make, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we just want to make a statement here. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, and say we don't -- we don't support this.  And, um --
L:  Mhm. [MN] [SIGH]
R:  So --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I think that's all kind of --
L:  What time is it now over there?
R:  What?  In Boulder?
L:  Ah, yeah.  In your city.
R:  Well, that's the biggest thing.  They're trying to do this thing. And -- and, um, you know, there have been some peace marches and stuff down in Denver.
L:  Uh-huh.   
R:  There's been quite a few of those, um.  When I was working at the fabric store --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- somebody came through to buy material to make peace banners for a rally --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  They were going.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  It was an older lady, saying, "Oh, we just have to, you know -- we just have to go do this".
L:  Voice themselves. [LAUGH]
R:  Gotta go say something.  Can't just, you know --
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. So, there's some of that stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- going on.  But, I don't think too much around town.  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I know they -- they do hold some rallies here and there.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Most of them are down in Denver.
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh.  
R:  And then there's just the City Council.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I didn't see any big, um, r- rallies here in Seattle.  Maybe it's not time [NOISE] yet.  Or maybe, I live far, ah, from the city. [LAUGH] And I --
R:  You live a bit outside?
L:  And I -- I -- I -- ah, yeah, outside.  It's, ah, like a [NOISE] [MN] suburb.  What do you call that?
R:  A suburb.  Uh-huh.  
L:  Suburb, yeah. [SIGH]  Yes.  And I don't watch TV a lot either, so --
R:  Oh, we don't -- 
L:  Really it's --
R:  We don't watch much either.
L:  -- something I don't have any [inaudible], yeah.
R:  I read the paper a little bit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just so I can kind of keep up, but --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  Most of it's a little too depressing right now.
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh. 
R:  But, I do get, um -- I'm on a lot of mailing lists --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- about different activist type things, and so --
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh.  
R:  So, I get notifications about different petitions and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh -- uh-huh.
R:  -- sometimes.  So, um.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  But, it's --
L:  Good, uh.  [MN] Yeah.  It's good that m- somebody's [LAUGH] doing something.
R:  Yeah. I don't know how much it helps.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- prayer groups.  You know, there's a lot of prayer groups that are --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- active doing prayer.
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh.  
R:  So, I get emails on that sort of stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And, um, you know, just praying for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- peace. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's the -- that's the least --
R:  All around the world.
L:  -- we can do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's the least we can do.  Yeah.
R:  It is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I sort of feel like it is.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I just hope ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  When I saw the Lord of the Rings, the second one -- 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  The movie -- I don't know if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you saw that.
L:  Oh, I haven't seen that movie.
R:  Yeah.  They have -- they have a big war in there, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it just reminded me of everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's going on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now.
L:  Uh-huh -- uh-huh.  
R:  And at some level it just --
L:  No, here's your bunny.  Oops.  Here's [inaudible].  
R:  Okay?
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  It just reminded me that -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to have hope.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  That that's really all we have right now.  We just have to hope.  That was what the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- message came through for me.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- and that's all so important.
R:  It is.  It is.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  Just hold out the hope --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and to keep praying, and --
L:  Yeah -- yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  No matter what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- happens, to keep praying. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  That's what I get.  I -- I -- I don't know what else to do about it.  I feel --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- I feel a little bit helpless in some ways.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  And I feel the same way.
R:  You feel that way too?
L:  Yeah -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Like, it's all just --
L:  And -- and --
R:  -- snowballing.
L:  And -- and then the other thing I don't understand is, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, our [NOISE] President, um -- he -- he's a -- he's a Christian --
