L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi. I'm Paul.
R:  Hi.  I'm Gina.
L:  Hi, Gina.
R:  To talk to you.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good -- I'm good.  Uh, this is my first Fisher phone call.
L:  Me too.
R:  Oh, great. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, neither of us really knows what we're doing.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, so what do you know about the Middle East?
L:  I -- you know what?  I honestly am not a big current events fan, um, so I don't really follow it all that much.  It doesn't seem like peace will be achieved there any time soon.  But hopefully one day. 
R:  Certainly not.
L:  I don't know.  What about you? 
R:  Um, well, I -- I should know about this.  I'm, ah, in a public policy program.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, but, [LAUGH] I'm not sure I know as much as I'd like to.
L:  You're at school now?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Where -- where at school?
R:  Um, I'm, ah, at grad school in Duke.
L:  Oh, cool.  That's a great school.
R:  Yeah.  I'm really enjoying it.
L:  I just graduated under grad at Rutgers last year. 
R:  Oh.  Congratulations.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Are you a linguist?
L:  [LIPSMACK] No.  I'm, ah, I was -- well, I was an English and theater major.  I kind of just applied for this 'cause it looked like fun.  Um, they've called -- I didn't have my PIN until today.  They've called me, like, a thousand times in the past month.  And I just --
R:  Yeah.  I had the exact same experience.  I was home for Christmas, with no PIN. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh --
R:  I've been turning off from ten to twelve. [LAUGH]
L:  Wasn't it obnoxious?  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh my God.  I was so angry at them.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I just -- I just said to them, "You people don't[?] either stop calling me or send me a PIN, I'm going to kill you all."  But, I --
R:  I don't know.  That was the funny thing 'cause I didn't validate my PIN, because I, you know, assumed that then they would not call me until I validated it.  But was not how it happened.
L:  No -- no.  They just keep calling forever.
R:  Yep.
L:  So, peace in the Middle East, huh?
R:  Yeah.  I'm not really sure whether they're talking about Israel, in which case, no, I don't think that peace is possible there any time --
L:  Ever?
R:  -- in the near future. 
L:  No.
R:  Not any time in the near future.
L:  No, I agree.
R:  It's just not --
L:  I mean, Israel's --
R:  -- with Israel's policies.
L:  -- has too much baggage to handle through before they're ever going to be [SIGH] peace.  As do all the other countries, you know.  I'm not assigning any blame, but they've all got a lot.  And they all honestly have points on their side, you know.  Jerusalem has [several inaudible words] have different claims to it.  And I can't really fault any one without -- you know, from my limited knowledge.  I'll be the first to say I'm not excessively aware of the subject.
R:  Yeah.  I think in that case, it's such as long standing historical conflict.  Even if someone finds a political solution, that won't satisfy a lot of people.  But --
L:  No.  I -- yeah.  I agree.  There has to be -- it has -- there has to be some change in the attitudes on the citizen level before they're ever going to be able to have peace on a national level. 
R:  Yeah.  But I'm not -- it seems like they're -- they almost need a change in their, you know, cultural psyche.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I -- I mean, I know that they run a lot of programs that really try to get young children to form bonds across cultural lines.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  To try use up[?] some [several inaudible words] older they become the -- you know, the more resistant they are to that kind of relationship.
L:  Well, of course.  And it's a self perpetuating cycle.  I mean, even -- whatever efforts they make, there's still all this hatred going on that -- just kids pick up on.  And it -- it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this awful cycle.  And then it's -- I don't know how they're ever going to get out of it.
R:  But, I mean, I think some of the other conflicts going on in the Middle East stand a much greater chance, um.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, this is where conflict has to do with lack of leadership and democratic opportunity.  I think that, you know, a lot can be done there in the next twenty years.
L:  Sure.
R:  And I don't know how I feel about the US's involvement in that.
L:  [NOISE] You know, [SIGH] the United States just really has a tendency to butt their nose in where it's not wanted.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and I -- I -- I don't know.  I [SIGH] -- part of me just says w- we really have to deal with our own problems before we can go round telling other people how to live.  You know, until we're per- not -- not perfect, but until we -- we go through a lot improvements, 'cause we have some serious problems.  And I don't think [SIGH] that we're so evolved or enlightened that we can tell other people this is the right way to live.  I mean, [SIGH] obviously we don't want some human rights violations, because those are just, you know, abhorrent.  But, we can't tell people, "Yes, you should vote in free elections" when our own system is flawed by its very nature.  We can't say ours is better, [NOISE] you know.
R:  You know, the -- the head of US ID[?] came to speak at Duke about a month ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And someone asked him pretty much this exact same question. And his response was -- you know, about what the US was doing in the Middle East and, you know, what effect, ah, humanitarian aid was going to have on -- on the peace process.  And he said, "Well, [LIPSMACK] we can't start a Protestant revolution there, and so we'll never be able to solve the, you know, conflicts over there".
L:  Mm.
R:  So, that was a pretty shocking thing to say.  I mean, he basically --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- blamed Islam for the current conflicts.
L:  That's hardly fair.
R:  I agree.
L:  But, ah, it's -- it's pretty harsh.
R:  Yeah.  I thought, coming from a major government representative of the US -- I was pretty shocked. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  You would think -- I don't know, you'd think he'd have to be a little more PC than that, at the very least.
R:  Yeah.  But -- I don't know.  I completely agree with you.  Um, but I just think that that is a widespread sentiment, that, um, Islamic governments aren't capable of ruling peacefully.
L:  You do, or do not think that?
R:  I think it's a widespread thought.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't believe it myself.
L:  Mm.
R:  But --
L:  Mm, mhm.  Well, yeah, because -- just, you know -- we'd have -- there's so prejudice put in race[?], especially after September eleventh, that anyone with -- with that color skin -- it doesn't matter what their religion, or nationality, or anything is.  We just have this -- this idea that that person -- anyone from the Middle East is evil. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And of course that's not true, any more than, you know, we should all be judged by anything a given American has done.  I don't want to be judged for what George W Bush has done, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  Um, but -- but that's the sentiment around here right now, and understandably so.  I mean, [NOISE] September eleventh was obviously an awful, horrible tragedy.  Of course it's -- it's not right to blame either[?] a whole people, or a whole color of people, or creed, for the, ah, actions of some individuals.
R:  No.  I fully agree.  What do you think --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  -- about the -- what do you think about the US sending troops over?
L:  I'm sorry?  I -- there's a bad connection.  I couldn't hear that.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Can you hear me now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think about the US sending troops over?
L:  To Afghanistan?
R:  To Iraq.  No, to Iraq.
L:  To Iraq?  Um, ha, it goes back into my whole, like -- hey, we really need to work on what's here first and let other -- let other periods[?] -- um, but, I don't know.  I hate George W Bush, so kind of whatever he does, I'm against it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just by definition. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Interesting. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's a severe[?] policy to adopt, you know -- just, oh, I hate it by definition.  I'm just kidding.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but, yeah.  What about you?  What do you think of the troops?
R:  I think it's a really tricky situation.  I -- I know there was a study that came out, ah, a couple of months ago that said that even if Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, they were unlikely to use them, unless they were challenged, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- were losing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, I find that to be pretty plausible, in which case I'm seriously against us starting any kind of violent conflict. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- I'm not really, ah, a hawk.  I'm more about --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- let's work this out peacefully [inaudible].  Really sometimes it's just not an option, but I don't think we're at that point where it's not yet.  And I don't think we should do anything to antagonize someone to get to that point. [NOISE]
R:  No.  I agree with you.  Do you think --
L:  So, how does this work?  Do we each get ten dollars, just in the mail or something now?
R:  I don't know whether they're going to send us a ten dollar cheque, or whether they're going to wait until we finish our cycle and send us the cheque.
L:  How many conversations do we have?  Because I was looking at the website the other day, when I requested my PIN again, and it seemed to say we only get three or four.  But, I've been called a million times.  So, and just not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- been able to speak.  So, I'm curious as to how much money I'm going to be able to make off of this.
R:  I don't know.  Well, they said you can have up to twenty five conversations.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Two hundred and fifty dollars for sitting and talking on the phone?  Really can't complain.
R:  I think that they must get really different, ah, responses to some topics, because, you know, you and I are running out of things to say about the Middle East, but, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they'd have asked a pretty basic question about our family values or traditions or things like that we probably could talk for ten minutes, no problem.
L:  I agree.
R:  But, there's got to be some dud topics. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true. I -- I've heard some of the topics, you know, 'cause it -- you know, I -- it says what the topic is, obviously, before you speak.  And I'm like, "Oh, that sounds interesting.  I wish I could talk about that one".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, I've been out of luck, and --
R:  Sometimes --
L:  -- Middle East --
R:  -- I'm really --
L:  -- wasn't exactly my forte.
R:  No, it's okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, did you become a -- did you become a employed, ah, graduate of college, or ...?
L:  Yes.  I'm -- I'm -- actually just got a promotion today, coincidentally enough.
R:  Oh.
L:  I work at Score! Educational Centers.  I don't know if you have those in -- we have them in North Carolina.  But, it's a kind of --
R:  Is that like a skills and learning center kind of thing, or ...?
L:  Kind of.  I mean, in the de- in population, but a very different philosophy about how we go about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- so, it's a fun place.  And I get to work with a lot of kids, and kids are cool.  They're generally better than adults.
R:  That's good.  Do you have young kids, or high -- high school kids, or ...?
L:  Four to fourteen.  So, we've got kids who are learning algebra, and kids who are just learning the alphabet.
R:  And are you doing mostly -- are you doing mostly humanity stuff?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Is your involvement there mostly in the humanities?
L:  Um, no.  It's -- it's just tutoring them on their basic h- basic --
