L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Danielle.
L:  Danielle, I'm Jeff.  How are you doing?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  I guess we just start talking about this?
L:  Just talk about perjury?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, actually my buddy was supposed to do this.  He told me it was going to be like on, ah, like a current topic, like, ah, war in Iraq or something like that.  But, it kind of threw me off.  Perjury.  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, where -- where are you, ah, calling from?
R:  Ah, Washington DC.
L:  Okay. Well --
R:  How about you?
L:  We're in Phoenix.
R:  Oh, really, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Far away.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's nice.  It's nice.
R:  So, I guess the question is, would you commit perjury for a -- a relative or close friend?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um.
L:  What is it?  Do you want me to start it off?
R:  Oh, well, sure [LAUGH] it's so weird.
L:  [LAUGH] it is kind of weird.  Um, how long are we supposed to talk?  Do you know?
R:  I think that they cut us off, or I think it's supposed to be ten minutes and then they cut us off.
L:  Ten minutes, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  Hm.  Well, I think obviously it would probably depend on the situation.  If you're talking about, you know, something petty -- ah, it kind of just depends on what the penalty's going to be, I guess, versus what the rewards are going to be, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you break it down rationally.  Maybe if you're going to lie to, you know, save, you know, save your dad's job or maybe even save your dad's life, you'd probably perje[?].  But maybe if it's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something minor it probably wouldn't -- it probably wouldn't be worth -- it wouldn't be worth being dishonest.  It kind of, I mean, it kind of depends if, you know, kind of what your philosophy is.
R:  Yeah, I was thinking that it would -- it would depend on the circumstances.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, if you knew someone was innocent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they didn't have a good alibi, maybe there's a lot of circumstantial evidence --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you know for a fact that they're innocent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would you lie in that circumstance?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think I might [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I think so, too.  I think most people, it would probably depend on the circumstance, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I doubt there's too many people that would be, you know, just, they have like a straight moral imperative to -- I'm never going to lie, ever, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think pr-  -- with -- with everyone it'd have to depend on the situation.  Quite a bit.  I would think.
R:  Yeah.  And I think that, um, it's -- people see it differently, you're not lying for yourself, you're not lying for your own benefit, you're lying for someone else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I think it takes away the selfish aspect --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people feel more like they're doing something for someone else, so it's not as bad [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.  I agree, too.  It would kind of be seen as helping someone else, even if it might be a detriment to a third party --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I -- I only know, you know, it's so kind of a broad question, I don't know how, you know --
R:  Yeah, it really is.  I mean, totally depends on, you know, how serious it is and what, you know, what the circumstances are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how you feel about that person and [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of -- a lot of different factors.  It -- yeah.  It'd be hard to say an absolute yes or no.  Which, I guess, that's true in most things in life [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  There's a lot of grey areas.  Hm.
R:  [inaudible] we seem to agree, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I don't know how we're going to talk about it for -- for ten minutes.
L:  Ah.  Is this from University of Pennsylvania?  Is this -- is this who set this up?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Did you go to Penn?
R:  No.  I didn't -- actually, um, I'm a grad student at George Mason and --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- I got the, um, all the information from the Linguistics Department at George Mason --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they sent round a -- an email to everybody and I just got it from that.
L:  Okay.  
R:  I guess they're sending around the country because you heard about it in Phoenix [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- my -- my buddy, his mom [COUGH] speaks at a bunch of different schools and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and she caught word of it somehow.  Are you, ah, are you a linguistics grad student?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm getting my Masters --
L:  [NOISE] Wow 
R:  -- in linguistics.  So.
L:  I- -- linguistics has always seemed really interesting to me.
R:  It really is.
L:  I -- I didn't even hear about it until I, ah -- hold on a second, what?  I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay.
L:  Um, I didn't even hear about it until I started reaching Cholmski[?] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of course linguistics is kind of not what he's really well known for, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's how I kind of came upon it and I'd read, oh, just a tiny bit of some of his linguistics stuff --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- that was really interesting.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  He's hard to read.  I find him very difficult
L:  Yeah.  Do you -- do you, ah, ever ready his political stuff, or more his linguistics stuff?
R:  I have and I've only read his linguistics stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I heard all about his political things, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's pretty extreme [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, he's pretty -- I -- I agree with -- with him on quite a bit, ah, not everything, but, you know, I'd say a lot, but I remember just reading, a -- I had like a Cholmski reader which kind of summed up all of his political and linguistic things.  I think --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- I think when he was a grad student he, ah, he just did it when he was majoring in linguistics he did just a simple survey, I think he asked five hundred people to -- you probably -- you might know about this -- just one question, "How are you today?" real generic.  And I think out of like five hundred answers, there's only like two people that said the exact same thing.
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I didn't -- I didn't hear about that.
L:  That's pretty amazing, because you figure everyone -- no one's really going to say how they're really feeling --
R:  Right.
L:  -- most just say it's fine, but even just staying fine, only two people matched up.  So, that's pretty amazing.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway, the perjury.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're -- we're veering off.  I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah.  That's okay.  I -- I can't really think of too much more to say about it.
L:  Yeah, I don't know if I do, either.
R:  I don't know if it has anything to do with Bill Clinton and his perjury.
L:  Yeah, that could -- it could be.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You have to like someone who can debate the meaning of the word "is" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you've got to -- you've got to admire that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's amazing.
L:  What do you mean, what -- what is is, what i- -- you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty incredible.
R:  [LAUGH] Very funny.
L:  Mm.  Ah, I can't really think of anything else to say about it, really.
R:  I know.
L:  Hm.  I guess you, h- -- there's some -- obviously some philosophical stuff [SIGH] but, I mean, it'd be kind of nothing we've alr- -- haven't said already [NOISE].
R:  You mean, like a -- absolute morality in that situation, that kind of thing?
L:  Yeah, kind of like, um, well, you're a grad student, you've probably heard of Kant[?] haven't you?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know about that.  It was just that absolute moral imperative and it's the only way you can ever really have any type of moral backbone is if you have a -- a, you know, a kind of a self rule.  I guess self paradigm only across the line but you, I mean, I -- who's going really do that, like, you know, it's a -- if it's a loved one's job or life on the line, no one's going to do that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no one's going to do that [LAUGH].
R:  I don't know too many people who have that.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't -- I don't think I know any.
R:  Maybe they would never murder somebody.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Never, ever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know anyone like that [MN] so [SIGH] hm, but then I guess you could --
R:  But I guess there are, you know, a whole core system is sort of based on you can't -- you can't just have absolutes, you have to have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you know, different punishments for different people and different circumstances --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- and they sort of acknowledge you can't have that absolute --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, the really only place you find absolutes, kind of fundamental religion, usually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [MN] we've seen what that can do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, yeah.  Um, yeah and I guess you could think about, I don't know, just u- -- utilitarianism and, I mean, even -- even if you're doing something that's perceived as wrong, is it really wrong if it helps out a lot of people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, how do you -- how do you even gauge it, really?  It's tough to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Since we don't know each other, have you every purged anything?  Oh, not purged, I guess that means throwing up?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you ever committed perjury?
R:  No, I've never testified in court, so --
L:  Oh, this is in court?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you know, I mean, I -- I think I --
R:  I think that's what -- I think that's what they're asking.
L:  In Court, yeah.  I know I've, ah, signed my parents' name on a few report cards.
R:  Oh, well [LAUGH]
L:  Throughout the years.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Who hasn't, though, right?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um.  Yeah.  I -- yeah, I've never been in -- never been in court, either.
R:  I guess I've never really had the opportunity to test my, ah, willpower there and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  You never know.  You never know until you're up -- up against it.  [SIGH] I know, I have a job, um, where, ah, we get -- it's such a boring job, we get all this paperwork and sometimes if they don't have a -- a correct way of dating it, you have to send it back to them, you're not allowed to change any of the records --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- and I know, I'm still in training, but I've seen [LAUGH] I've seen my boss [LAUGH] just kind of look around, make a few slashes, a few -- a few eights into sixes and a few --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- twos into sevens and -- and that.  I mean, morally I don't really think that's a big deal, but I just -- maybe company policy, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] It's hard to stand up for a lot of company policy.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And half of it, I mean, oh, yeah, yeah.  It's [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- no one -- you know what I mean, you don't care about it, I mean it just -- it's BS anyway.  Other policy.  So, you really don't feel bad lying to them.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly [LAUGH].
L:  You feel kind of good, really.
R:  It's not really lying when you lie to your boss [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  If you're going to BS me I'm going to BS you right back.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't know how much more there is to say, really.
R:  [several inaudible words] I think it's been ten minutes.
L:  Has it been?
R:  Yeah --
L:  I don't even know.
R:  -- I don't know if they're going to cut us off or what.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I think we're supposed to talk all the way until they do or --
L:  Yeah, I wondered that.  Are we supposed to talk until they cut us off, like, for instructions, or --
R:  I mean, it's been -- I think it's been a full ten minutes, I was looking at my watch.
L:  Okay.  Well, let's talk just like for a few more minutes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if they haven't cut us off we can just go and hang up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess we could do that.  Where'd you, ah, where'd you go to undergrad at?
R:  Actually the same place [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- strangely enough.
L:  You what?
R:  Strangely enough, I went to the same school for undergrad.
L:  Where you from?  DC area growing up?
R:  Yeah.  And I just -- I actually was living here after I graduated and just, um, they had a program I wanted, so I just -- I kind of wanted to go to a different school, but that didn't make sense when they had what I wanted --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- it's a State school, so [SIGH] affordable [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Mm.  What was your -- was your undergrad linguistics?
R:  Ah, no, actually my undergrad was in, ah, English composition.
L:  Okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  So, you -- you're a good writer, huh?
R:  Well, I mean, I try [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Um, do you have to, ah, you don't -- you don't have to get anything published, do you when you did this undergrad English?
R:  Oh, no mm-mm.
L:  Okay.  I didn't think so.
R:  No.
L:  Oh.
R:  Lucky.  Lucky for me [LAUGH].
L:  Do you have to get something published in grad school?
R:  I think it depends on if you are getting an M.S.A. --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you might, for that.  I don't know.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I'm going to -- I'm going to grad school, ah, next fall --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- for -- for political science, so --
R:  Oh, great.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  So, these questions are right up your alley.
L:  Yeah, they are.  I -- I w- -- I was -- I was hoping for more like a -- kind of like a, I don't know, global affair, you know, local affair type thing, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's fine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Perjury's -- perjury's fine I guess.
R:  It's not a very -- you can't really say a whole lot about it, the whole thing.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I guess linguistically, no one would have the same words, but I mean, I think everyone would have pretty much the same -- get the same point across.
R:  Yeah, I was wondering what the, ah, point of this, ah, what they're -- what they're trying to find out with the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like I have a feeling it has something to do with how you speak in certain situations and not necessarily what you're talking about --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- like a topic.
L:  -- that's --
R:  But I don't know.  I mean, I'd be interested to find out the results of the study.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  It would be interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, linguistics isn't like su- -- I mean, is it just like super technical, like, [inaudible] diagrams?
R:  Yeah.  It's a lot of that, syntax.  I really like phonology, it's really interesting --
L:  And w- --what's that?
R:  You study the, um, the sounds of different languages, how --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- how different sounds go together and --
L:  Really?
R:  -- form different languages.  It's really interesting.
L:  Hm.
R:  Especially when you study English and you have no idea how complicated [inaudible] is.
L:  Yeah.  Tha- -- that's what I've heard, English i- -- is one of the hardest languages to learn, it's very complicated.
R:  It's just like these things that you have, this knowledge that you have that you don't realise you have, it's amazing.
L:  Yeah.  That's incredible.  Have you studied the Vietnamese language at all?
R:  No.  Mm-mm.  
L:  My --
R:  Not -- not specifically.  We study different languages, like we do different phonology projects and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how they -- how they work --
L:  Huh.
