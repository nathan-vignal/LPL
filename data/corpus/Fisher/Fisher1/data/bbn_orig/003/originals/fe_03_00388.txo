R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.  My name is Connie.
L:  Hi, Connie.  My name is Warren.
R:  Hi, Warren.  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  Okay.  So, do -- do either of us cont- consider other -- any other countries to be threats to the US security?
R:  At the present time.  Yeah.  Ah, yes, I think -- I think we are in a little bit of danger.
L:  Yes, I -- well, I, ah -- North Korea is not causing me any great, ah -- any great, ah, ease at night, um.
R:  That's right.  It was a nuclear threat.
L:  Yes, I -- and --
R:  And that's kind of a surprise 'cause that's has been in the background for --
L:  Yes.
R:  I could guess the Arabs' situation's kind of covered that up for a good length of time. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yes.  It's true.  Um, I confess that I am, ah -- I am not impressed by Mr Bush's, ah, attempts to make Iraq out to be a -- a massive threat.  Ah, it would be easier if Saddam Hussain were not such a creep.
R:  [LAUGH] It would be.  It would be far easier if we had some support from other countries.
L:  Exactly.  Um --
R:  It -- this -- u- unilaterally going in there is going -- would cause us a huge amount of trouble, I think. 
L:  Yes.
R:  We -- we -- we'd lose out good guy white hat status. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I think that we've come close to losing good guy white hat status at any rate.  Ah, I've just returned from a stay in India and --
R:  Ooh.
L:  Ah, there's a -- there's a great deal of speculation there about what's going to happen.  And of course, ah, Mr Bush's attitude towards, ah, Pakistan, and the general change in the United States' attitude towards India has been, ah, the subject of enormous amounts of concern over there.
R:  I'm not sure that I'm all that familiar with his status [MN] -- are [MN] -- have we ...?
L:  Well, you remember after September eleventh he began, ah, putting a lot of US emphasis on, ah, cooperation with Pakistan.  And --
R:  Sure, because we needed their bases there.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But the -- the flip side of that is that Pakistan was not a democracy, and hasn't been a democracy for a damn long time.
R:  Mm.
L:  And India is a democracy.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, there was a general --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- consensus in India that Bush was giving India a short shrift.  
R:  Oh boy.
L:  Ah, because of course he wanted some place that was proximate to Afghanistan.  And then secondarily, there was a general consensus in India that, ah -- ah, Mr Bush is entirely ready to cooperate with military democracies, as long as they're America's military democracies.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or --
R:  True.
L:  -- military dictatorships rather.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, aside from that, ah, you know, when I think about countries that are threats to the United States, [SIGH] I have to wonder what's really meant by a threat.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I sometimes feel like the biggest threat to the United States is the United States.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know about that, but I'm -- I'm not afraid of, you know, losing the United States as it is, or losing a war.
L:  Mhm.  Yes, that's true.
R:  I'm just afraid of terrorist attacks like -- like nine eleven, um.  Um -- um, I don't know what they could do now that w- would be as -- have such an -- you know, as big an impact as that had.  Um --
L:  Oh, I can imagine any number of things and I don't really [LAUGH] -- there's -- there's all sorts of things that can keep you awake.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, well.
L:  Ah -- ah --
R:  Biological warfares and things like that, but.
L:  Well, for that matter, just, ah, someone driving a tank full of gasoline.
R:  Sure.
L:  You know, um [MN] --
R:  I live in a high rise building with a parking garage underneath [LAUGH].  There are nights I don't --
L:  Yep, exactly.
R:  -- sleep too well.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I -- it -- it has seemed to me that in the period of time since September eleventh that what we were looking at prior to September eleventh was a situation in which, ah, the generally accepted, ah, shallowness of Mr Bush's intellect was, in a sense, compensated for by the sharpness of the people who were --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- as it were, handling him.
R:  Yes.
L:  Whether or not you agree with -- with his politics -- I personally do not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, is -- is immaterial in that -- in that case.  I mean, the --
R:  He did pick some smart guys around him.
L:  Yeah.  He's got some smart guys.  Well, I think they picked him, in a sense.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I [inaudible].
L:  I don't think that -- I don't think that -- that he had a lot to do with the picking.  I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that he's a little bit more figure head.  But, I think that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- September eleventh changed the balance of power dramatically, and put -- put Bush in a -- a strong leadership position.  And what that means is that now he's, ah -- his public pronouncements and his, ah, conception of policy has a great deal more influence, ah, than it did before then.  And the -- this is part of the -- the real concern that I have, and what -- what makes me think, in a sense, that -- that the biggest danger to America is right now really, ah, is -- is our own national actions.
R:  Uh-huh. [MN] 
L:  Ah, the -- the, ah, vacillating between Iraq and North Korea, for example, and the absolutely bizarre sets of rationalizations --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that -- that they're trying to come up with.  Well, it's perfectly okay -- they have na- they have nuclear weapons -- sorry, that should be +nuclear weapons -- um, ah, but we don't have anything to worry about that because we've always known about them.
R:  Ah.
L:  Or something.
R:  Well, his -- his refusal to follow any of Clinton's policies is --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- is annoying, huh.  [MN] We had some things that worked.  You know, why not keep doing them?
L:  Yes.
R:  And I don't understand his popularity.  I see his popularity polls.  He's still over fifty percent.  And what -- with what's happened to our ec- economy -- our own economy should've --
L:  I know.
R:  -- brought that down.
L:  Well, that's part of what's going on.  I think the, ah -- the, ah, uproar about Iraq, ah, coincided in a rather significantly coincidental way with the uproar over Enron.
R:  Oh.
L:  I think that there was definitely a need for a wag the dog type of, ah, scenario to play out there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because a lot of those people are awfully close to --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- Mr Bush, and --
R:  If not he himself, right?
L:  Ab- well, that's exactly right.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  And, ah --
R:  And convince me that this whole thing's not about oil.  The thing in Iraq.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  Well, that's -- that's one of the things that I think is -- it's remarked on outside this country.  You know, in -- in the newspapers in India and political commentary in India, and also in the -- just the people that I talk to.  Um, they -- they would turn and ask me what -- basically they'd say, "What the hell is going on?  Why is this person acting like this?" 
R:  Mm.
L:  And really there was a -- there was a general bafflement.  Um, and I think in another, ah -- another, ah, way of thinking about this, my experience as hav- -- someone who's lived in the Third World for many years.  I lived in India for about six years and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and done a lot of travelling.  Um, the average American is, ah, extremely insular and has a very short attention span [MN].  And when I -- I'd look at, um -- I remember -- I think it was in nineteen ninety four when the Prime Minister of India was visiting the United States, and did a joint press conference with Clinton.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there was exactly one question asked about India or --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- Pakistan, or the entire, ah -- that entire half of the world, um, by the team of Washington press corps.  And everything else was, ah, concerned with Clinton's domestic policies.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  And --
R:  [LAUGH] That's absurd. 
L:  Well, it is absurd.
R:  Huh.
L:  And that -- it got played up rather strongly in the Indian press that -- that effectively Americans don't know damn all about the rest of the world, and they don't care.  And unfortunately -- well, there's a -- there's, ah, well over a billion people in India right now.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  That's more than there are in the United States.  America is not in the majority.
R:  I -- the two countries that I don't want us messing with is India and China.
L:  That's right.
R:  I -- I -- I think they're -- they're the two that we could lose to if -- if we were ever to lose.  But, India -- so much of the culture [MN] it -- i- it is very different, but there are things that are -- are much the same.  The -- the way they approach business, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I was a computer programmer --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and I know that, um -- that some very talented programming's being done over there.
L:  Oh, very, very much so.
R:  Ah.
L:  And in -- in fact, there was, ah, a general consensus that during the previous spate of, ah, muscle flexing between India and Pakistan, where it really seemed as though there might actually be a border war --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, the people from the information technology sector actually, ah, got together in a sort of +consortium and went to the Prime Minister of India and said, "You must stop this.  It's bad for business".
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, it would be.
L:  And a lot of -- the -- the real problem there -- and this is an area in which I think we're -- we can -- harking back to the original concern, ah, that was addressed in our -- our conversational subject --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What countries are -- are -- ah, reflect on the security of the United States?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think that there's a very, very high possibility of a nuclear exchange between Pakistan and India in the near future.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I don't like that at all.  I have family in India and friends over there, all over the country.  And I -- I know that, you know, people who are my people would die.  But --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  But -- but more to the point, in a broad general way, just because two countries on the other side of the globe get into a war and blow up millions of people doesn't mean that it's irrelevant to the United States' security.  It means that it -- it would, ah, grossly destabilize the, ah -- ah, the nature of -- of world politics right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I think that that's something that, ah -- that -- that really terrifies me.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I don't just think it's what --you know, what could --
