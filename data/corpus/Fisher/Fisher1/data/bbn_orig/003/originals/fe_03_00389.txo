R:  HI.  I'm Jeff.
L:  Hi.  I'm Tony.
R:  Tony, hi.  Ah, so ah, do you think that any other countries --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are a threat to the United States?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I've [MN] been pretty concerned about the North Korean situation.  What do you think about that? 
R:  Yeah.  So, that's, ah -- that's kind of caught me off guard, I think.  I wasn't, ah, paying very close attention to that.  I had my sights on the Middle East and watching what was happening there.  But, ah, this North Korea's caught me off guard.  And -- and, ah, their leader seems crazy enough to, ah -- to do something, whereas, ah, I -- I'm -- I think Saddam Hussein is crazy, but I'm not sure that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he's, ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I think he's maybe a little more predictable in his craziness, if you know what I mean?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I think I would agree with you.  I think w- -- not that Sa- Saddam isn't, you know, crazy.  But, I think he sort of realizes at some point that, you know, the oil is their lifeblood there -- in their economy.  I look at the North Korean situation and say, "Those folks really don't seem to have anything to lose".
R:  Right -- right.
L:  And I wonder if that provides for, like, a more, you know, irrational kind of motivation. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah.  So, I -- from -- well, for me personally, ah, part of the nervousness is that I don't know very much about it, you know.  I -- I -- you know, as -- as a citizen I have, ah, twelve years of experience --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- watching Saddam Hussein, and I, ah -- it's sort of the devil you know and the devil you don't know.  The -- the -- North Korea -- I just -- you know, hasn't been on my radar, so I don't know what to expect.
L:  I think you're right.  It's been like that with everybody.  I think it's sort of snuck up and the situation's become a little bit more volatile.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, so in what -- in what way could, ah -- do you -- in what way do you think North --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- Korea could really jeopardize the US?  Ah, do -- they -- they probably don't have any kind of long range missiles to, ah -- to endanger US soil, do you think?
L:  I don't know.  Probably not +deliberately, but I sort of wonder from the terrorist perspective if they've seen enough, um, ah, [MN] -- of -- of those happening, I guess, in the news.
R:  Right.
L:  They, ah -- they appear to have stopped the UN inspections. [NOISE]  We know that they have, ah, [NOISE] -- you know, that they're -- you know, [MN] very close.  They've already demonstrated nuclear capability. [NOISE] 
R:  Right -- right.
L:  And they now seem to want people -- ah, I -- I think I remember something or hearing something in the news [NOISE] about the -- at least one of the reactors that they had there, um -- well, you know, nuclear powered reactors.  I -- I think the question about it was they were not sure it was producing enough power to be used outside the reactor, or i- it was merely self sufficient.  Like, just -- produce enough power to support itself, you know, that it used.  But, they -- they seemed to -- to have demonstrated the capability and they don't seem to want to have folks coming in there and -- and they're kind of pulling back from international relations. [SIGH]  So, I -- it -- it -- it's just an uneasy feeling about, ah, you know, what are they -- it may be just a +ploy for attention --
R:  Right.
L:  But what are they going to try next? [NOISE] 
R:  Right -- right.
L:  [NOISE] And unfortunately sometimes these -- the -- you know, the radical kind of approach does certainly seem to get people's attention. [LAUGH]   I certainly don't agree it's the right way to go, but it -- it -- you know, people seem to -- you know, when you look at bin Laden and the stuff in the Middle East, I guess that we've all been concentrating on that.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, those folks do seem to get their names in the papers and get the attention.  So, hopefully --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the -- the -- the folks in North Korea aren't feeling the same way.
R:  I -- I wonder if, ah, North Korea is in a position to -- well -- so -- I'm not sure that -- that North Korea has the infrastructure -- the, you know, sort of terrorist cell network, ah, around the world --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get something into the US, ah, in the same way that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, I have the impression that bin Laden, and al Qaeda maybe, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has been, ah, working for years at setting up something, ah, where they might be able to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, you know, trigger some sleeper cell somewhere.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that took years of planning and fore- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if -- if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something exists. And I'm not sure if North Korea has something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, something reasonable --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- that it really could do some kind of terrorist, ah, acts on the US.  I guess I have thought more that the threat might come --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from them attacking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- US interests, ah, in -- in the region, like, ah, US troops in South Korea or something like that.
L:  [NOISE] And that's 'bout doing what -- good point.  It's probably a more, ah, ah -- certainly a bigger threat, ah.  I -- I just find my -- I -- I guess I'm uneasy about the whole -- like, yo- you mentioned before, that part you just don't know. 
R:  Right.
L:  We -- we've heard so much about that bin Laden's been doing.  And I think you're absolutely correct.  He's -- whatever he's been doing, he's been working on for years.
R:  Right.
L:  He's even made, you know, threats wh- which seemed idle at the time.  But, these guys, you haven't heard much about them before.  So, yo- kind of really don't know where they're at, and what they're up to, and -- or what they want. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, there appear to be a couple of, ah, you know -- ah, possibly, ah, nego- negotiating tactics for, you know, us to take, and, you know, find out what they want.  I --I think we were going to offer them some, [SIGH] ah, power subsidizing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, energy subsidy or something like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just so we could find out what they're doing and get them to stop, you know, playing games with their nuclear weapons.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I just find the kind of, ah, ah -- you know, it's -- it's a little nerve racking, I think.
R:  Yeah.  It is definitely unnerving.
L:  Just -- just 'cause you don't really know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  My wife is completely convinced, ah, not of -- my wife isn't worried about North Korea.  My wife is completely convinced that, ah -- that, ah, bin Laden is, ah -- is gonna, ah, give us some big attack that we're not expecting in the next few months.  And so, she's -- ah, she get nervous --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about going downtown, ah, to whatever.  Ah, were -- where do you live, actually?
L:  I'm -- I'm actually just out -- just west of Philadelphia.  So, ah, I don't know -- in the --
R:  Oh, okay.  Um --
L:  -- western Philadelphia suburbs.
R:  Yeah, okay.  I'm up north of Boston a little bit, so.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, it's, ah --
R:  So, my wife gets nervous about going into Boston for anything.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I can sort of understand that.  I get the same thing.  I -- I -- my wife Patty was saying something about, ah, [MN] -- sort of back at Thanksgiving, like how the -- I guess the Friday right around Thanksgiving's considered --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one of the largest shopping days.
R:  Right.
L:  And the last place she wanted to be was a mall --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause she figured it was a perfect target.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so we're saying the same thing.  Just stay away from the malls on the big days.  [MN] It -- it's a shame you have to think that way.  You know, [MN] it's entered into our families minds about that, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's a real concern.
R:  So, [MN] -- so, I -- I find there's a difference between my wife and myself on this.  My wife, it actually affects her decisions about, you know, where she wants to go and so forth.  She feels like retreating a little bit into the safety of our home and so forth.  But, I -- I -- I -- you know, I watch it in the news and I follow it, but I don't tend to, ah -- I don't think that it affects my decisions in terms of, you know, whether I'm likely to travel or -- or even fly overseas or whatever, ah.  So, I think there's different -- different people have a lot different reactions to how it affects them.  Ah, I don't know.  Where do you fall on that?   Does it --
L:  it -- now, it's funny that you mention that.  I -- I haven't had the opportunity to travel since it's happened.  Ah, I -- I used to make at least a trip once or twice a year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We -- we were talking about, perhaps, like a Disney World vacation at some point in time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when the kids were out of school.  But, ah, ah, and it was my wife that was mostly, ah, you know, interested in doing that.  And she seems to have not mentioned it in a while.  So she -- she's definitely pulled back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I'd like to think, ah, like you'd mentioned, that it wouldn't -- you know, wouldn't affect my day to day decision making that way.  But, I haven't had to -- actually had cause to test that.  So, I haven't had to travel anywhere.  I haven't had to get on a plane or, you know, or anything like that.  Ah, I -- I do tend to think w- with, ah, the bin Laden situation that he's obviously looking for headlines and, you know, individuals like, you know, you and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I in -- in our homes was probably, in and of themselves are not targets.  He wants something on a much grander scale.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, it's going to be something like, ah, you know, like a -- of a big park or people were speculating malls, ah, you know, around the -- the black Friday shopping and the Christmas shopping season.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it -- it's a shame 'cause unfortunately some people will be in the area and -- and be a victim of circumstances.  But, I think individually, ah, I don't feel there's as much of a personal threat.  It doesn't make it any less real of a problem, but --
R:  Right -- right.
L:  Ah.
R:  Yep.  I agree.  I agree.
L:  So, it --it's kind of funny.  I -- I always -- I was -- I was speculating to people -- this is kind of wishful thinking, but I guess my -- my answer to the whole thing, and it's something that never would happen, is like I kind of felt like the US should put some really strong effort into some alternate forms of fuel for cars.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I me- -- I mean it just sounds so great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just something that you know probably will never happen, especially with -- with some of the, ah, current leaders of our country have coming from oil money.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's much easier said than done, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It just seems to me, if you take away the economy over there then those people aren't as much of a threat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, you know, there's -- we've got to have other technology that you can power a car with, ah, you know, fly planes with -- things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're starting to investigate -- I mean there's a couple of hybrid cars on the market.  I think Honda and Toyota each have one.  Ah, that it's partially battery powered and, you know, part gas engine.  So, I just kind of thought we just need to develop some technology like that then flood it into the market. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right -- that's right.  Yeah that -- that, ah -- that would -- so, do you have, ah -- do you have a big car?  Do you use a lot of gas?
L:  I -- I +actually sort of have a foreign car; I have an old Nissan, ah, Maxima, which I guess actually was considered a full size car when I bought it.  It's like a ninety two or a ninety three.  It -- it's still pretty old.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And my wife drives a, ah -- a Ford station wagon.  So, they're both big cars.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  Which, you know, from that perspective you've got to be concerned about how much gas you're consuming, and where the money is going.
R:  Yeah.  We just, ah -- well, right around the -- right around the time of the World Trade Center attacks we upgraded -- well, just before that, we upgraded to an SUV.  And now I'm, ah, wondering how wise that was and w- wondering how guilty I should feel about that.  But, ah --
L:  What?  From the gas consumption?  Or, ah --
R:  Just for the gas, yeah.  And -- and, ah, how much, ah, ah -- you know, what -- what -- what my contribution is to, ah, ah, making the US dependant on foreign oil or whatever.  So, here in Boston there's, ah -- there's sort of urban activists that are going around, ah, spray painting SUVs, ah, you know, indicating that -- or slapping bumper stickers on saying this car supports, ah, ah, Saddam Hussein, or Osama bin Laden, or whatever.
L:  You know, some folks get, ah, pretty radical if they had it themselves.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.
L:  I remember seeing, ah, ah, I guess an email that had gone through our company, ah, probably a month or two ago th- th- -- it listed a bunch of, ah, oil companies and it said, ah, "You know, of all these oil companies, there's like on- only like two -- and two of the probably the less known that don't do any importing of oil from, ah, overseas".  And, ah, British Petroleum or something like that.  And it's like, ah --
