R:  -- in Philadelphia.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Hi.
R:  Syracuse?
L:  I'm Sue.
R:  Near [several inaudible words] oh still pretty close.  I was wondering whether I'd get a  --
L:  Good.
R:  -- West Coast dinner[?] for this call or not.
L:  Okay.  I'm from Syracuse --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- New York.
R:  Okay.  Ah, yeah, once a while ago.  
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's pretty easy.  We just have to talk for --
L:  Um, I've never done --
R:  -- ten minutes --
L:  -- this before, so ...
R:  -- about the education question, I guess.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  Did -- did you hear the prompt?  It was something about -- about computers in education. [PAUSE] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh-huh.   
L:  Yeah.  Right.  And I'm, ah, a --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- returning student getting my teaching degree right now, a- as a older student.  I have teenagers at home.  So, I don't --
R:  Well, on computers --
L:  -- know if that --
R:  -- in education I -- I --
L:  -- helps or hurts.  I don't --
R:  -- guess on the one --
L:  -- know, but wh- -- um, what's -- 
R:  -- hand I think it's inevitable --
L:  -- your perspective --
R:  -- um, so I've -- I'm kind of  --
L:  -- on this? 
R:  -- an ongoing student.  Ah, I guess I started to do undergraduate work in eighty one and I've done, you know, another degree and another degree, and I, um, I also work at the university.  So, um, I've been around to see the change and at least in -- in higher education, I don't know -- it's -- it's -- I think it said higher education.
L:  Okay.
R:  Anyway, in higher education, computers are just everywhere.  You know, it used to be the case that, ah, you had to go to the lab to do your computing.  And, ah, I was I the library yesterday and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think just about everybody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- had a laptop, you know, plugged into the network --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, in -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the library, so everyone was doing Internet while they were typing their papers and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, downloading music probably from the web.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, entertaining themselves simultaneously with working.  How 'bout you?  [PAUSE]  Mhm.
L:  Right.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- just think it -- it seems pretty important, um.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't think there's any way around it right now.  And I -- I see the same thing.  I have teenagers, and I mean, they use --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their computers for everything.  And I have students in first, second, third grade that I'm doing, um, student teaching with right now and they even use the computers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for, um -- just all kinds of stuff --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- at school that -- 
R:  -- specialize on working --
L:  -- you know, especially with --
R:  -- with kids with disabilities --
L:  -- kids with disabilities --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  It's just a huge help to them.  [PAUSE].  Yeah -- yeah.  So, um, it -- it's just -- it's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- such as big help 'cause there are all these other programs that automatically spell correct --
R:  I'm curious --
L:  -- for them.  They do --
R:  -- what do you --
L:  -- everything for them.
R:  -- think is, ah, so useful about the --
L:  So, it --
R:  -- ah -- ah --
L:  -- really is a big help to them.
R:  -- the computer for kids with disabilities?  Why is it that it's more helpful than -- [PAUSE] mhm [PAUSE] --
L:  Well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it hard for kids to even write.  Some of 'em don't have any -- have very good --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- even coordination.  And the spelling really trips 'em up.  So, if you've a got a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- computer that can spell or help with spelling, or even do spell check, it just really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- helps them a lot, so they don't caught up so much in trying to spell, that limits them in what they wanna write creatively.  So, I think it --
R:  Right.  When you --
L:  -- really helps.
R:  -- talk about the coordination --
L:  But --
R:  -- problems, do you mean --
L:  You know, I'm not --
R:  -- it hard for them to hold the pencil --
L:  -- a hundred percent on that --
R:  -- but it's easier to type?
L:  -- but that's how it seems to me, you know?
R:  Okay.
L:  So.
R:  Okay.
L:  Some of the kids -- yeah, it's hard for them to hold the pencil.
R:  Right. [PAUSE]
L:  And I've even worked with kids with autism where it's just -- it's so necessary --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a computer of some kind because they can't write, so it's their means of communicating.  But, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just normal everyday average teenagers that I have, I just -- I see them doing -- coming home and doing PowerPoint presentations.  I mean, things that are so far beyond what I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ever could have done in high school because, um, it just wasn't available.  You know?  So, I see them --
R:  Right -- right.
L:  -- being much farther ahead professionally, even when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they --
R:  Certainly --
L:  -- get out of --
R:  -- in the --
L:  -- high school --
R:  -- workplace you have --
L:  -- or college --
R:  -- to be able --
L:  -- or whatever --
R:  -- to do things like Powerpoint presentations --
L:  -- just because --
R:  -- and spreadsheets --
L:  -- of having that --
R:  -- and do --
L:  -- access to --
R:  -- documents --
L:  -- computers now.
R:  -- on Word.  So, if -- if your children are learning how to do that already in school that's a great advantage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than having to learn it.  We have people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, where I work, who, you know, didn't have all that -- that -- that level of experience --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I sometimes forget.  Like, I'll sometimes tell some people, "D- do me a spreadsheet real quick that -- that -- that does the following" and they'd be like, "I don't know how to use a spreadsheet. [LAUGH]  How do you do that?"  And it's surprising because, you know, I'm -- I'm used to students that I see around me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- who are also, um, using spreadsheets all the time --
L:  I know.
R:  -- as though it's nothing. [PAUSE] 
L:  Right -- right.  Ah, is this -- I just think that, um --
R:  Right.  My wife works --
L:  -- computers are just --
R:  -- at a, um --
L:  -- becoming a -- 
R:  -- nursery --
L:  -- necessity.
R:  -- school.  She has --
L:  And I don't --
R:  -- four year --
L:  -- think --
R:  -- olds in --
L:  -- there's any way --
R:  -- her class.
L:  -- around it.
R:  And the nursery school director has told them that they can't have a computer in the classroom because she thinks it's really important --
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- for four year olds to spend, you know, their whole time socializing.  And she thinks that if they had computers they would, you know, just interact with the computer and not learn to socialize.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm wondering what you think of that, and [PAUSE] mm -- 'cause I'm not a teacher, so I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you have that perspective.
L:  That's -- that's an interesting point. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I think it's interesting because I can see why they would say that.  I don't know what your wife thinks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I can see how they're a big distraction for certain --
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- kids, especially boys.  Some of the little boys with [LAUGH] attention deficit or whatever, um, they just -- it's -- it's a -- it's a real draw to them, and they just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kind of stuck on it and they -- it -- it's hard for them to interact. 
R:  But it --
L:  And those are the kids that really need interaction.  So, I can see why they might say that.  But it would seem like it might be nice to have it for limited periods of time, maybe, you know, a half hour a day or something where -- or it was like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a reward kind of thing.  Or, you now, just, ah, maybe some time spent.
R:  Right -- right.
L:  But, you know --
R:  But, you told --
L:  -- not that it -- 
R:  -- me you're 
L:  -- was available --
R:  -- working with --
L:  -- all day.
R:  -- some kids --
L:  But, that --
R:  -- who have PDD[?] --
L:  -- a certain amount of time --
R:  So --
L:  -- it was --
R:  -- I guess --
L:  -- available to the kids. 
R:  -- the question is, do you think --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- that the school should sort of accommodate them by providing them with a computer, which is -- you know, helps them to write, although it doesn't help their interactional skills?  Or should kind of fight against their natural inclination and make them interact when -- when I think a PDD kid doesn't want to often, or is embarassed by trying to interact? [PAUSE]  Right.
L:  I'm not sure that they're capable.  Some of these --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kids aren't really capable of, um, communicating.  And some of them can't really speak very well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if they have some other means of communicating and they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- can use it and it works for them, then yeah, I think the school probably should provide it.  But I think most schools have it now, you know.  So, I don't think it's a matter of whether they --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I guess --
L:  -- whether it's available --
R:  -- I was asking the question of --
L:  -- or not.  
R:  -- whether it's right to --
L:  I think it's just a matter of --
R:  You know, when you assess --
L:  -- whether it's provided for them.
R:  -- them you see a kid 
L:  Is that --
R:  -- who has --
L:  -- what you're saying?
R:  -- some kind of a socialization problem there's two things I think you could do.  You could say, "Well, this kid's having a problem socializing, so we'll provide the computer --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- as a kind of companion --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or a helper to get the academic work done".  Or, you --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- can go the opposite way and say, "No".  
L:  Right
R:  "What this kid needs is to be sort of forced to socialize, and so --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- we're take the computer away".  And it's a hard call -- very -- exactly.
L:  Right.  Well, that's a hard --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- call, you know.  It really probably depends on the kid's, um, disability and how extensive it is.  Um, I --I -- I see both sides of that, but I think it -- it's hard to say, but some kids are just so disabled that they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really need it to do their work and, in that case, you know, I think by all means provide it.
R:   [LIPSMACK] I think you're right.
L:  But, it's -- it's a hard call.
R:  I think it is a --
L:  It really is, you know.
R:  -- sort of individualistic thing.
L:  it really depends on each --
R:  Um --
L:  -- individual, I think.  What do you think?
R:  And, ah, I also guess that there's no one solution, e- even though people will philosophically fall on one side or the other.  You know, this idea that we have to fight ag- -- fight against -- you know, f- force kids to do things that they don't do naturally, I think can be overex- overextended, you know, so that the school becomes kind of antagonistic toward them, if it's trying to get, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kids to socialize, for example, when that's --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, their disability makes it makes it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- difficult for them.  And -- and that runs against their inclination.  I think what you need to do is not to create an environment where they're forced to do something, but rather to find ways to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- encourage them or find ways to work around the disability.  So, did you, um -- have you been working with disabled kids all along?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or is this your new --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- concentration since you've gone back to school? [PAUSE]  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, it's sort of been since I've gone back to school, but I have children with disabilities of my own.  So, it's, um -- kind of seemed like a natural thing.  And my husband decided to have mid life --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- crisis and move out a few years ago, so --
R:  So, where are you?  Are you at --
L:  Here I am, back in school again.  I never thought I'd go back --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- to school again, but I'm getting my masters, so --
R:  Uh-huh.   And what university is this?  Are you at Syracuse?
L:  Um, I've got a year --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- left.  And I'm just now starting --
R:  Okay.
L:   -- my second year.  At Syracuse University.  Ah, it's a reading, language, arts program.  And we actually h- -- are required --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to take computer classes.  We're required to take a -- like, a computer in the classroom class, which I haven't taken yet.  But, um, and that's because they feel that -- that it is so critical that you're --
R:  Right.
L:  -- familiar with computers and what programs are available for children with disabilities and that --
R:  What do you --
L:  -- sort of thing.
R:  -- think about the sort of --
L:  So, I -- I think --
R:  -- diag- diagnos- --
L:  -- it's --
R:  -- diagnosis 
L:  I think it's, um --   
R:  -- of disabilities --
L:  It's a pretty good thing.
R:  Um, so -- you -- you say that you -- you have children with disabilities?  Actually I have one also.  I have a daughter with disability.  Um, ah, she has, ah --
L:  You do?
R:  Um, I'm going to forget what it's called now.
L:  What kind of disability?
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, auditory processing disorder.  Um, so she's very slow to pro- -- you probably know what it is actually.  She's very slow to pro- she has a difficult time --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- processing things that she hears, ah, which makes it very difficult for her -- 
L:  I don't --
R:  -- in a --
L:  -- know --
R:  -- classroom --
L:  -- that much about it.
R:  -- because, um, you know, the instructions are typically given verbally --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she often doesn't understand what being told to her.
L:  Right. [PAUSE] 
R:  I think they're the best thing.  Um, she --
L:  So, you must --
R:  -- learned how to read --
L:  -- have some kind of opinion -- 
R:  -- for example from --
L:  -- on computers for --
R:  -- from computer --
L:  -- somebody --
R:  -- games.
L:  -- like that.  I mean --
R:  Um, and in fact it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was odd because she wasn't speaking very well --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when -- when she was very young, but she was reading.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, quite -- quite ahead, you know, because [MN] it -- it -- that -- that matched her -- you know, her -- we didn't try to fight her disability.  We didn't try to say to her, "No, you --"
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  -- must talk".  We let her kind of excel in areas that she was really good in and we figured we'll just need to take more time to get her to --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- speak, and speak, you know -- and -- and to understand that to -- to interact -- interact gracefully.  But I also think that, you know, the diagnosis --
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I -- I guess I wouldn't say that a diagnosis is [MN] -- for ADD I -- I think it is the case that we over diagnose.  Um, for other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- disabilities, I don't think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's the case --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that we over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- diagnose, but that we sort of created them.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, these are kids who, under a less demanding school situation, would not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have a disability in some sense bec- --
