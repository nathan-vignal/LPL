R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.  Do you watch television sports?
R:  Um, somewhat. Not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not an awful lot.
L:  I don't, like, watch any. [LAUGH]
R:  Well.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know --
R:  How come you agreed to this question?
L:  Well, I didn't know I had a choice with the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- question.  Do I get to pass on some of them or something?
R:  No, they, ah, said -- they asked you if you wanted to talk about it, so.
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, what do I do now?
R:  I don't know.  T- talk about -- why don't you --
L:  I can talk about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I --
L:  I mean, what do you watch?
R:  I watched -- I watched football when I was home [MN] at my father's house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- over Christmas, 'cause that's what he watches.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, just to be friendly, 'cause I don't see him very often, I'd sit and watch football with him.
L:  Right.
R:  Something I used to do when I was a kid.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, I don't do it any longer.  Ah --
L:  So, you don't watch sports very much any more?
R:  No, not so much any more.  Did you ever watch sports?
L:  [SIGH] Um, really and truly the only kind of sports I've ever watched is, like, the gymnastics and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I watched a little bit of that, but, I mean, most people don't consider that sports, I don't think.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't -- maybe.
R:  [MN] Not -- well, not like professional sports.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, like I think now they mean professional sports on TV -- is football, baseball, you what -- basketball --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- tennis, hockey.  Yeah, all of these are professional now -- ah, soccer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um --
L:  Golf?
R:  Golf, for sure.
L:  [LAUGH] Hey.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I'm related to Tom Kite.
R:  I don't know who that is.  Is that a --
L:  He's not -- he's, like, a famous golfer and stuff.
R:  [MN] Did you ever watch him on TV?
L:  A long time ago I used to, when I lived at home. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L: [LAUGH] 
R:  Um --
L:  But, I don't any more.
R:  Yeah. I don't spend a lot of ti- I don't watch much TV in general.
L:  I don't either.  I'm -- I'm on the computer a lot of times.  And then, also, um, I'm a student.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I am too.
L:  And so, [NOISE] I go to school a lot, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm a single mother, and [SIGH] -- I got divorced this week.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cool!
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess that's a professional sport.
L:  Well, sort of.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, and I enrolled and I told the Nursing Department to kiss my patootie and, um -- I [LIPSMACK] don't know -- I done all kinds of stuff this week.  Anyway, um -- bu- [LAUGH] -- as far as sports is concer- hey!  Our school -- the school that I go to --

R:  Yeah.  I guess it's professiona- I guess it's professional. 
L:  Yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it is.  They get paid for it, man. 
R:  They do?
L:  Well, I don't know about at this school.  But, um --
R:  Where -- where --
L:  But, in --

R:  Colorado?  Oklahoma.
L:  I live in Oklahoma, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's big time out there -- professional --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Now, there's a professional sport, for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you ever go to a rodeo yourself?
L:  Oh yeah.  Rodeos are, like, our big thing.
R:  Are they televised ou- out there?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Is it something they televise?
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  I went --
L:  I think it's --
R:  -- to a rodeo once --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Once --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- in my life, when I was living in Colorado.
L:  Cool. [NOISE] 
R:  And, ah --
L:  We -- we go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We, um -- on tel- on TV, a lot of times we get a, ah, bull -- like a bull riding [NOISE] from Reno, Nevada -- or from Nevada somewhere.
R:  Wow.
L:  And it [NOISE] --
R:  Is that on cable TV?
L:  Um, it [NOISE] used to be on satellite.
R:  A special rodeo channel, I bet.
L:  Well, no -- no -- no.  It's just [NOISE] like a -- what? [NOISE] -- not now, baby, not now.  Um, it's a, um -- no, it's -- it's, like, a country music channel or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and they -- they -- they have to put it on every once in a while.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's like, um, +obligatory or something, you know.
R:  I've never seen that on TV.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh --
R:  [MN]
L:  You don't listen to country music either?
R:  No -- no.  I'm saying I've never list --
L:  Oh.
R:  I've never seen, ah, a professional rodeo on TV.
L:  A rodeo on TV?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh we used --
R:  Is that a -- that --
L:  -- to watch it consta- 
R:  Why?  'Cause they have, like, championships and all that stuff?
L:  Oh yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, um -- they have, ah, [NOISE] -- oh they -- I don't know.  They have, like, world class, you know -- I mean, it's -- it's like, a really big deal.
R:  All this --
L:  On that --
R:  Ah, roping -- roping cattle and riding bronco -- riding --
L:  Well, yes.
R:  -- bulls, and all that?
L:  The ones that we watch [NOISE] -- is, um, the -- the bull riding.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mainly.  Um, and they have -- they do have the other, you know, sp- events and stuff, but --
R:  How long -- how long of a, um, program would that be?  Like a few hours?
L:  [NOISE] Couple of hours.  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Couple of hours?
L:  Yeah.  Long time. [NOISE]
R:  And, um -- yeah, that's big time out there.
L:  Oh yeah.  It's a big deal.
R:  I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Arizona.  I don't think it's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't there are much of -- there -- there's some of it out here.
L:  Go.
R:  But, I didn't -- I never really got into that too much.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, I'm --
L:  Oh well. [NOISE] 
R:  -- not really from here.
L:  It's fun.  You're not from there.  I can tell you're not.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Massachusetts.
L:  Yeah?  There you go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my hus- my ex husband's [NOISE] family is from, [NOISE] ah, [NOISE] Sturbridge.
R:  Oh yeah, in western Massachusetts.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  So, how did you hear about this, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- linguist thing?
L:  My friend ch- told me.  My friend on the Internet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- told me [NOISE] that, um, she signed up for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, like -- I don't know -- you get ten bucks a call or something --
R:  But --
L:  You know.
R:  I just signed up this after- I think they called me a little while --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ago.  I was out.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  I missed by fifteen --
L:  Yeah.  They call me --
R:  -- minutes.  I just -- I'd just signed up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] I was out -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the phone rang while I was gone for fifteen minutes.  I said --
L: [NOISE]
R:  "I bet it was them".  Then they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- called back.
L:  Well now, see, I signed up [NOISE] about a week and half ago or something.
R:  So, they gave you a choice.  At the beginning they -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- say, "The topic --"
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- is, ah -- tonight's topic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- is sports on TV".
L:  Oh.
R:  "If you want to participate, just say one".
L:  I didn't get that part.  I must of missed it.  I don't know.
R:  So anyways, um --
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
R:  I think I might --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Sometimes I put it on and I just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know -- if I'm really bored I put the TV on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  With some sports in the background or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know -- it's something that I grew up with.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, I don't really care. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  All I ca- or say, like, the Super Bowl is on.  I feel like, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I want to know who won, but I don't really care.  But --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's so if somebody's talking about it, I know what they're talking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about.
L:  Right, [NOISE] right.
R:  It's very irrational.
L:  Not really.
R:  Yeah. Do you ever --
L:  You kind of want --
R:  -- do that?
L:  -- to part of the group.
R:  Yeah, something like that.  
L:  You know.
R:  That's how it is.  But --
L:  [NOISE]  That makes sense.
R:  -- it wouldn't really matter to me who won the game.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] You just want to be able to talk about it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  'Cause, like, last --
L:  When it comes up in conversation.
R:  Like, last year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- year the New England --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Patriots -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- won the Super Bowl.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, that's supposedly my --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- home town team, right?
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
R:  But, ah, it didn't really faze me all that much.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Didn't really care one way or the other?
R:  And this year -- like, I -- and I moved to Arizona last year, and the Arizona Diamondbacks won the World Series last year.
L:  Cool!
R:  They beat the New York Yankees, which was, like, big news, you know.
L:  Oh yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And so, ah, I remember watching that.  No!  I didn't have a TV at the time.  We had it on the radio.
L:  Oh cool.
R:  'Cause we had just moved here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And wh- and when they won, all of a sudden you could just hear from --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- outside, all the screaming --
L:  [LAUGH] I bet.
R:  -- coming from everybody's house.  You could just --
L:  How funny.
R:  -- hear it.  Live, ah, celebrations.
L:  How funny.
R:  So, I guess I had -- don't spend, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I probably average about zero point zero one hours a week watching sports. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you watch [inaudible] --
L:  I don't even average that, so ...
R:  If you watch a rodeo you watch more than I do.
L:  [NOISE] Well, occasionally I watch rod- [LAUGH]
R:  I saw -- I saw something on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- professional -- while I was on vacation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, my mother was in hospital and while we were there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they had this thing on these -- these -- the strongest men in the world competition.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you ever see that?
L:  Um, no.
R:  Incredible.
L:  I haven't, but --
R:  These guys, like, pull cars.
L:  I did see someone --
R:  Pick up these big, big --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- balls that must weigh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, like, thou- I don't know, hundreds of pounds.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All these real absurd things.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  They drag these big pieces of iron and stuff like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Really strange.
L:  That's wild.
R:  Yeah.  And these guys are, aw, aw, huge.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Big muscle guys.  And that's what they train for.  And this is professional.  They do it for big bucks, I guess.
L:  Really?
R:  I never even heard of anything like that before.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, that -- that was kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interesting to watch.  And it --
L:  That's funny.
R:  -- was just 'cause we were in the activity room and it was on the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- TV, so ...
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] That's cool.
R:  Sometimes you learn different things.
L:  [NOISE] So, you go to school in Arizona?
R:  Yeah.  Arizona State University.
L:  What's your major?
R:  Teaching English as a second language.
L:  Oh, how cool.
R:  Yeah.  So, that's where I got this -- from the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- linguistics teacher.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ah ...
L:  Now, see, my husband is from Belgium. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, English is his [NOISE] second language.
R:  Ah.
L:  Or my ex-husband, I'm sorry, excuse me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] It's a habit, you know? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anyway -- but, um -- but that's rather interesting.
R:  What kind of sports do they play in Belgium?
L:  [NOISE] Um, they play s- soccer --
R:  Soccer.
L:  But, it's football.  No!  It's football, but it's soccer.
R:  Yeah.  It's foot- 
L:  There you go. [NOISE] 
R:  Here, w- -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You have to -- you have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- call it American football.
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  'Cause football -- soccer is the most -- probably the most popular in the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're the only ones that are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- late to come to that.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, we didn't have soccer when I was kid in, ah --
L:  Uh-uh. 
R:  -- in high school --
L:  I don't remember it.
R:  -- and stuff like that.  Now -- now, everybody plays soccer.
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
R:  I think that's an -- pretty good sport.  I like that 'cause it's a lot of running and it looks --
L:  Well, um --
R:  -- doesn't look so violent as -- as football.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  It's a little tamer.
R:  Football is very violent.  It's like a war out there.
L:  Yeah, it really is.
R:  You know, everybody puts these uniforms on and they --
L:  My --
