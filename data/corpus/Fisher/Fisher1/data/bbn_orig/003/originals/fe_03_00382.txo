L:  Hi.  I'm Jay.
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Whitney. [COUGH]
L:  How you doing?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Fine, thank you.  Actually, um, they called as I was, um, [LIPSMACK] eating a burrito.  Forgive me. [LAUGH] 
L:  No problem.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, anyways, the topic.
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah well, personally, let me just give you some of my background.  I grew up in the Middle East.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  Um, yeah I did.  I actually grew up in Saudi Arabia.  My father worked for the oil companies there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was also there for the Gulf War, so -- a little different view than most people, you know, that are taking part in this.
R:  Um, is it -- are you ethnically Arabic?
L:  No, I'm not actually.  Ah, I'm Asian.  My parents are just pretty much engineers --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of the oil company there. 
R:  That's right.  You're from India, right?
L:  No -- no -- no.  I'm from --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm from -- my parents are from --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the Phillipines.
R:  Oh, from the Phillipines.  Okay.
L:  Ah, you have any, ah, experience or any connections to the Mid East, or?
R:  Well, actually I -- I happen to be Jewish, um.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, no I have several friends who, um, were, um, Indian [NOISE] ah from [NOISE] -- actually they were from -- forgive me.  Let me [NOISE] -- I know this phone is kind of quirky.  I'm sorry for the, um --
L:  Ah, no problem.
R:  -- the blips.  Here we go. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Um, but I have some -- some friends who are from, ah, ah, Bengal who, ah, worked in -- actually, not Saudi Arabia, but, uh Yemen.  And, um, their -- their parents were engineers working for the oil industry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know that that's common for, like, non --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- nationals to go and work there.
L:  Exactly.  Well, I mean, the thing that is interesting is that it seems that the hatred is bred almost at the very beginning, and even not towards Arab nationals.  I know when I went to school there, um, we'd get maps, you know, sent in from the United States, and instead of Israel they'd have something crossed out and Palestine written in magic marker.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Over things like that.  I mean, it's hard to break that cycle.
R:  So wait.  Hatred?  When you say hatred, what do you mean?
L:  I mean, not necessarily --
R:  Hatred --
L:  -- outright hatred as in, like, there's propaganda being shouted on the streets, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  "We must take back the Holy Land" or whatever.  But, things like -- small things, like not even recognizing the -- the term Israel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for example.  Um, I don't know how it is on the other side, but I know the biggest challenge to -- you know, when to break the hatred is, you know -- is to, ah, basically, start at a younger age.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's tough to say that if you want to give up on the older generations, but I think that's in -- in all reality that's what you'd have to do, if there ever was a resolution to be met. 
R:  Um, so you're saying, ah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if we stopped teaching kids to hate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, then, ah -- right, that would help, um, alleviate s- ah, a lot of the tension in the Middle East, is what you're saying?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] Uh-huh.  Okay.
L:  Well, I mean, I think also, especially with Iraq right now, there's some issues with governments not necessarily representing the, ah, will of the people.  Um --
R:  Right.  Sure.  But, I mean, I -- I -- I mean, I kind of feel like, um, the government -- the current US government is not representing the will of the people.  I mean, it's -- first of all, it's a totally illegitimate government.  They weren't even el- Bush wasn't even elected.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  I mean, it's a crime against the American people that this schmuck is -- is in office.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right?   
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  He --
R:  Talk about -- talk about defrauding the American people.
L:  Mhm.  So, obviously, it'd be safe to say you aren't exactly in line with what -- what Bush's policies w- in the Middle East are right now?
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  Or his [several inaudible words]?
R:  You could -- you could say that.  You could say that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Or -- it could be spun so many different ways.  Um, what --
R:  'Scuse me[?]?
L:  What about the current stance with, ah, the US backing the Israeli army?
R:  Oh, I mean, they've been doing it for decades, right?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, actually, I think they really started doing it the nineteen sixties.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  Um, an-
L:  If my history serves me correctly.
R:  Excuse me? [NOISE] 
L:  If my history's cor- I think that you're right.  Yeah.
R:  Right, [NOISE] mine too. [NOISE] Um, it was really in the nineteen sixties, ah, that they started pouring money into, um, their military.  And I think if they just turned off that faucet, then actually you [LAUGH] would probably achieve some [SIGH] -- you might achieve some peace in the Middle East.  M- m- -- by --
L:  Oh, uh -- 
R:  -- turning off the faucet.  I mean, you know, if they -- if they stop -- if Americans stopped funding --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, ah, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Israeli occupation, ah, ah, of the Palestinian people, then ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  I mean, I think that's interesting.
R:  Then -- then it would stop.
L:  But, in a sense, um, that's kind of what Britain did, you know, back -- post World War Two, when they kind of just turned their back on both peoples and let them try to -- try to decide it on their own.
R:  Well, I mean --
L:  Ah.
R:  They have a right to decide it on their own, right?
L:  Mhm.  Well, I mean, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's a case then of just Israel having so much more of a powerful army, but at the same time being surrounded by hostile environment.  Like, a hostile --
R:  Well, yeah, but they made the environment more hostile, right?  By -- by, um, you know -- I mean, their colonial power.
L:  Mhm.  I mean, my fear is that --
R:  And a nuclear power. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Which is all the more scary.  I mean --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- my fear is that if you left[?] something like that -- if the US were to completely pull out without --
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  -- set guidelines, without treaties between the two nations, um, or even establishing the two nations in each others eyes, +something like Israel -- I mean, not Israel, I'm sorry.  Ah, India or Pakistan would emerge.  So, you'd have, um, you know, just wide scale massacres.  I mean, it's odd to see that -- like, a people that you normally just w- call friends in an everyday mode -- um, the hatred that lies underneath that when it comes to fighting for land that's been in dis- that's been disputed for generations.
R:  Right.  But, I mean, what we're engaged in now isn't doing anything to stop that, right?
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.  I agree with that.
R:  And it's time to try a different course, you know, um.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And I would like to see what would happen.  I mean, we don't know what would happen if, um, um, [NOISE] the United States stopped funding Israeli state terrorism.  Right?
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  Um, we don't know what would happen, but it would be interesting to see.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it -- I could really[?] --
R:  I mean, what- whatever's going on now certainly isn't working.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  But, I don't know.  There seems to be some responsibility -- I mean, do you agree with the statement that the US, as a world power, has a responsibility to other nations?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] well, a certain kind of responsibility to, I guess, defend nations that are -- that are in trouble.  Right?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, um -- but, that's not what the US is doing, right?  I mean --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in principle, sure I agree with that statement, of course.  Who wouldn't?  But, that's not actually what's going on.  I mean, you know, the United States doesn't support democracy anywhere.  It didn't support democracy in Guatemala --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or Chile, or Iran. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I agree with you.
R:  Or Vietnam.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or any of those places, right?  Why --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  Self interest is more of the motivating factor than, uh, you know, almost a big brother type mentality in international diplomacy.  Is that -- would you say that statement's fair in terms of -- for the US?  That they're serving themselves more than serving other people?
R:  Oh, that's for sure.  And they're not even serving themsel- w- it's only a certain group of people serving themselves, right?  I mean, I don't think the American Government does a very good job of serving the -- most American people, right?  They serve a certain class of American people.  But, um --
L:  And this administration more so than --
R:  M- possibly.  I don't know.  But, I mean, the last administration, um, you know the -- the Clinton administration is the one that instituted welfare reform, which is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- probably the cruelest, meanest thing you could possibly do to poor women and children in this country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whereas, really, I mean, it was just -- it's [MN] evil.  It's just -- and -- and stupid, um, um -- it was a terrible thing to do.  And, you know, I guess somehow Clinton, you know, because he's -- he seems like a charming guy, got away with it.  I don't know how he got away with it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But he did.  
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I think -- in my personal opinion, I think the US should stop dealing with international politics so closely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but then again, it's too hard to do that in a world where everything's interconnected.
R:  Well, that's true.  Yeah, sure.  Um, yeah.
L:  Mm.  So -- [NOISE] what else?
R:  I guess though, um -- well, how -- how -- do you think that the US could possibly deal with other nations in a way that is more fair?
L:  Ah, I think -- in terms of that, I think they should listen to other nations more closely, rather --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than -- like, it almost seems like they don't care what other people think.
R:  Right.  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, [LAUGH] I always think it's funny whenever people m- mention NATO or the United Nations --
R:  yeah.
L:  -- and the fact that sometimes it's just the puppets of the US volition.  Um, and I think that's -- I mean, not to make a big generalization, but the US mentality, as a whole, is very, "This is what's right because we're doing it".
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  Um, and in a sense I think September eleventh could've been a nice slap in the face if it were spun the proper way, um.
R:  How so?
L:  It -- I mean, this is a very -- very minority view, and I'm not sure if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I fully agree with it.  But, [NOISE] rather than being so patriotic in response to September eleventh, I think it's also important to understand why these people did what they did.
R:  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  I agr- I would agree with that.  Yeah, mhm.
L:  Um, like I remember during the Gulf War where we had US bases -- pretty much full scale operations.  Um, and some of things that would happen, in terms of just treating the soldiers there -- I mean, sure they're actually there to protect Saudis -- the Saudi nationals, ah, from, you know -- from Saddam overrunning, but --
