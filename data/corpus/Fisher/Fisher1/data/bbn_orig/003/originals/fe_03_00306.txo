R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH].
R:  Hi.  What do you think about airport, ah, secu- --
L:  Well, first of all, I'm just introducing myself.  My name is Nadia and I'm from [inaudible].
R:  Okay.  I'm Adele, I'm from Cambridge, Massachusetts.
L:  Okay.  Hi.  Well, I think that it's not going to, like high security I don't think is going to decrease the risk of possible bombing or frightening situations.  I don't know what you think about it?
R:  Well, I -- I -- I agree, I think that if, ah, someone wants to, ah, bomb that they will manage to find a way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, but it may, ah, stop, ah -- some lesser types of crime.
L:  Right.  I don't know.  I'm from Italy, so I travel like at least once a year to go there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and when I enter like Italy, I have totally no security controlling me.  Only once in Germany they were like really controlling, like my backpack --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that was like the first time they were like -- also like put hands on me and control my pockets and whatever I had, like, in my backpack --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but otherwise I could have like pretty much anything.  I mean, I don't know like if a metal detector of course will detect like a bomb or something like that, but I don't know that.
R:  Well, I -- I think I've, you know, traveled, ah, as well, though quite a few years ago, oh, and I don't know if -- if you, ah, are old enough or probably to remember that in when there was the, ah, there were some terrorist groups in Italy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --ah, the Red Brigade --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a- -- and so on and -- and were bombing, ah, um, obviously at much lesser scale than, ah, what happened on September eleventh, but it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at the airports.  The major airports in -- in Italy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- Germany, for example --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible] was having trouble at that same time.  Um, and so there were some, um, measures of security being done at that time, but not certainly at the level that they're now -- now starting to do --
L:  Yeah.  Well, and I think, also, like [inaudible] today, like, it just depends who's working that day.  When I came back from Italy in Phoenix --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they were not like, I was not checked at all.
R:  In -- going out of Italy or in -- into Phoenix, either one?
L:  Coming into Phoenix, coming into the United States.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think they -- it -- it's when you board the plane that they are supposed to do the security check, ah, other than --
L:  Well [inaudible] that makes sense.
R:  But you -- where did you -- did you go through passport control in --
L:  Ah, yeah, that's where -- how it happened in Germany and they had like kind of good controls there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But when I entered, it was though they had no control at all.  And but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I left from the United States, either I was not really well controlled, I think, I mean they could have done more, I think --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if they really wanted to check --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I know they try, they look under my shoes, something that they never done before --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it seems that the metal detector was on a higher level because for instance like the buttons of my t shirt were beeping.
R:  Right.  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Things that had never happened before [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  They, ah, I, ah, went to Atlanta about two weeks ago and I had taken the change out of my pocket --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, in anticipation of the -- the machine, but I had left some, um, lifesavers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the wrapping paper has -- is slightly metallic --
L:  Oh, wow, so it beeped?
R:  -- and that set it off, yeah.  And so they had then to do the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, that I think it's higher and probably it's like better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I'm so sure that if someone wants to bring someone -- something on the plane --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they're going to make it because I believe they're going to have some kind of connection with the people that work there.
R:  Oh.  I think that's probably going to be the easiest way to do it --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, ah --
R:  -- they'll just get jobs, there.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, like a totally fine person --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, no one knows your background, you just study and you're fine and then at the right moment, ten years from now, you're going to do it again.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I -- 
L:  Like, that's what I believe, but [LAUGH].
R:  Well, I think you're right because I think that's how they were so successful the last time, is because --
L:  Right.
R: -- majority of the people were living in this country and training for what they were doing right here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they weren't coming in from elsewhere.
L:  I think they plan it like more than ten years ago that thing.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  If not more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now they're planning something for the future and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And would they say, well, maybe in a month we're going to bomb you again, I don't think that's going to happen.  It's going to happen when --
R:  Well, in --
L:  -- they don't say anything.
R:  Or they're going to do something else.
L:  Oh, yeah, of course.
R:  -- because the free -- this isn't as big a concern out west because, you know, a lot of people take trains and subways and -- and such and -- and, you know, they're not heightening security on, ah, passenger trains.
L:  Right.  I mean --
R:  -- you can hop on [inaudible] --
L:  -- they just would like -- they were frightened of having put a bomb at -- in the university a couple of months ago or so.
R:  Yeah.  And well, and that's another -- another concern.  You know, you could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- blow up --
L:  -- let's same [inaudible] security --
R:  -- several thousand people at once [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- at -- at a university, easily.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Because, you know --
L:  And if it's a public place, go to a library, for instance --
R:  Yeah, or --
L:  -- and lots of public, or --
R:  -- even, you know, ah, residence hall dining room --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at the right time and -- and particularly high rise residence halls.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, you know, would kill thousands of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of students all at once and then --
L:  Well, now I believe that the next, ah, day that they are afraid of passing through, it's going to be like New Year's Day, I think.  I don't know.  That's my suggestion.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Like, lot's of Americans are going to say, "Hey, be careful that day, something is going to happen".  Just like --
R:  Well, or, or Christmas, too.
L:  Or Christmas.  Just like Thanksgiving, they were afraid of Thanksgiving too.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But, I don't think so.
R:  I -- I -- I think that it- -- it'll be coming into -- or, you know, might be bio- biological, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's even worse.
R:  [inaudible]
L:   So, everyone suffers from it.
R:  You know.  Or something put into, you know, a river.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so it takes three months until everybody's sick, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- something, you know, the capabilities are endless.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If somebody wants to --
L:  Especially when the mind is kind of sick.
R:  Yeah.  If you want to bad enough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's, ah, many ways now to -- particularly when, ah, you have a lot of money which --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which, ah, is the case.
L:  Yep.  Well, what do you think about the -- how the Americans are responding to the threatening situation, I mean, not just besides putting high security in airplanes and -- but on the cities?  Like, all the -- all the talking we do on TV?
R:  You mean like going into Iraq and that kind of thing?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, ah, sometimes I have a feeling that we say too much.
R:  Well, um, yeah, they -- for example, they say, the other night, on the news that, you know, they caught, you know, a secret --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, a shipment.  Well, it's not secret if it's on the news.
L:  Right.  I mean, why do you keep talking about it, keep it like secret.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because the other people like the Iranian and all those people are going to listen to you.
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  So, they're going to say, oh, you stupid Americans, that's what you found out, it's not true.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think all the talk about war in the fall was election oriented --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that did --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so people didn't talk about the economy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which would -- would have hurt, you know, ah, Bush and -- and his supporters --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so they got everybody scared and instead, you know, hysteri- comes -- he's hysterical about going to war, then you're not going to worry about the economy and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, now the election's passed, they're slowing down and all of that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, ah, but I think you're right in that usually if you're going to go to war with somebody you don't alert them three months ahead that you're coming.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, usually historically people have been more successful if you showed up, you know, as a surprise.
L:  Of course.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because you say, oh, in three months from now we're going to bomb that spot in that area --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good job. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And -- and I work with, you know, a -- a lot of -- of Europeans, ah, here and, ah, you know, it's -- it's like, who are we to -- to tell other people to destroy their weapons when we have so many?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's, ah --
L:  I mean, you should be the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Americans should be like the first and say, "Okay, we pulled down one gun, now it's your turn to pull down another gun".
R:  Yeah.  It -- it's, ah, you know, and -- not for us to say everybody but us, you know --
L:  No.  Yeah.
R:  -- get rid of -- get rid of your --
L:  You cannot do that.  
R:  -- weapons.
L:  I see  being too much like, how do you say, patriotistic, what you believe --
R:  A patriot?  Patriotic?
L:  Yeah.  You believe so much in your country, so you're not going to quit.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, I -- I don't --
L:  I don't know.  This is like the first opinion --
R:  Personally, yeah --
L:  I -- I don't want to put it more stronger, something.
R:  Well, yeah, and so many -- many Americans, you know, they're just, ah, that's kind of been history, that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we -- but, you know, to me, whether or not you're willing just to run off to war isn't to me what makes you necessarily patriotic, but that's a minor opinion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [inaudible] minority opinions, I -- I think --
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  You're right, too.
R:  -- to most people it would be -- you would do whatever the President says --
L:  Yeah.  Go see if he's wrong.
R:  -- and -- yeah, whereas I think if you just agree, it's more patriotic to make that known --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because that means you care enough to want to change things.
L:  Yeah.  That's a perspective, too.  Yeah.
R:  But I don't think that is the common American perspective, I think --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- that that's considered more liberal than --
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, because in reality, to tell you the truth, I -- I'm not really following strictly what's going on. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Both in terms of politics and war.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just because I've -- I mean, war, yes, I realize it's there, it's scary, but it's not in my life now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I already have enough trouble for me, so I have to think about that one.  Fine.
R:  Well, I think that that's good because, I -- you know, like a lot of people are afraid to fly, well, you don't want to spend the rest of your life --
L:  Being afraid of --
R: -- being afraid it's --
L:  -- or just like, if every day I woke up and said, "Oh, my god, where is the war?  What's going to happen today?" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, well, I have to go to work and study every day, what am I going to do now?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly, yeah.  I agree.  And I -- you know, I think, you know, you should travel, you should do what you would do because --
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  -- if you --
L:  -- and whatever happens --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- okay, we will deal with it.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Because otherwise you're being a victim before there's anything to be a victim of.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So, I -- I agree.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know if I have anything else to say about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Are we supposed to talk until something beeps or something?
L:  Ah, is that the first time you do it?
R:  Yes.
L:  Me -- mine too, but a friend of mine told me that in the last, like, thirty seconds --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the machine comes back and says, "You have thirty seconds to say hello to your partner".
R:  Oh, okay.  So, we are good to go --
L:  So, that's sort of --
R:  X amount of time.
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we'll think of something to say.
L:  Something about frightening situations again.  Oh, something that really I don't like it, it's like I used to travel with, you know, those small pocket knives, just for like camping --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, I cannot do it anymore.
R:  No, you can't.
L:  That's something that I don't like.  It's like something tiny, come on, who do you want to kill with that thing?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I want to cut my apple.
R:  Well, you can [inaudible].  Yeah, but, ah, well, and I usually do like needlepoint --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, and I can't carry scissors.
L:  Oh, that one too?
R:  Yeah.  So, -- and you can't carry knitting needles or anything like that.  So -- so, you know, you -- I -- and I don't like to
