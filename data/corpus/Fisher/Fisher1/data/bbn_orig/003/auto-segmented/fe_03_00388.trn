WELL YOU REMEMBER AFTER SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH HE BEGAN AH PUTTING A LOT OF U._S. EMPHASIS ON AH COOPERATION WITH PAKISTAN AND  (fe_03_00388-A-0018)
EXACTLY BUT THE THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT PAKISTAN  (fe_03_00388-A-0019)
WAS NOT A DEMOCRACY AND HASN'T BEEN A DEMOCRACY FOR A DAMN LONG TIME AND INDIA IS A DEMOCRACY AND SO THERE WAS A GENERAL CONSENSUS IN INDIA THAT BUSH WAS GIVING INDIA A SHORT SHRIFT AH  (fe_03_00388-A-0020)
BECAUSE OF COURSE HE WANTED SOME PLACE THAT WAS PROXIMATE TO AFGHANISTAN AND THEN SECONDARILY THERE WAS A GENERAL CONSENSUS IN INDIA THAT AH  (fe_03_00388-A-0021)
AH MR BUSH IS ENTIRELY READY TO COOPERATE WITH MILITARY DEMOCRACIES AS LONG AS THEY'RE AMERICA'S MILITARY DEMOCRACIES  (fe_03_00388-A-0022)
OR MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS RATHER  (fe_03_00388-A-0023)

I I IT IT HAS SEEMED TO ME THAT IN THE PERIOD OF TIME SINCE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH THAT WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WAS A SITUATION IN WHICH  (fe_03_00388-A-0036)
THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED AH SHALLOWNESS OF MR BUSH'S INTELLECT WAS IN A SENSE COMPENSATED FOR BY THE SHARPNESS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AS IT WERE HANDLING HIM WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH WITH HIS POLITICS I PERSONALLY DO NOT  (fe_03_00388-A-0038)
AH IS IS IMMATERIAL IN THAT IN THAT CASE I MEAN THE  (fe_03_00388-A-0039)
YEAH HE'S GOT SOME SMART GUYS WELL I THINK THEY PICKED HIM IN A SENSE I DON'T THINK THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT HE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THE PICKING I THINK THAT HE'S  (fe_03_00388-A-0040)
A LITTLE BIT MORE FIGURE HEAD BUT I THINK THAT SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH CHANGED THE BALANCE OF POWER DRAMATICALLY AND PUT  (fe_03_00388-A-0041)
PUT BUSH IN A A STRONG LEADERSHIP POSITION AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT NOW HE'S AH HIS PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS AND HIS AH CONCEPTION OF POLICY HAS A GREAT DEAL MORE INFLUENCE  (fe_03_00388-A-0042)
AH THAN IT DID BEFORE THEN AND THE THIS IS PART OF THE THE REAL CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND WHAT WHAT MAKES ME THINK IN A SENSE THAT  (fe_03_00388-A-0043)
THAT THE BIGGEST DANGER TO AMERICA IS RIGHT NOW REALLY AH IS IS OUR OWN NATIONAL ACTIONS  (fe_03_00388-A-0044)
THE THE AH VACILLATING BETWEEN IRAQ AND NORTH KOREA FOR EXAMPLE AND THE ABSOLUTELY BIZARRE SETS OF RATIONALIZATIONS THAT THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH WELL IT'S PERFECTLY OKAY THEY HAVE NA- THEY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS SORRY THAT SHOULD BE NUCLEAR WEAPONS  (fe_03_00388-A-0046)

WELL THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK THE AH THE AH UPROAR ABOUT IRAQ AH COINCIDED IN A RATHER SIGNIFICANTLY COINCIDENTAL WAY WITH THE UPROAR OVER ENRON  (fe_03_00388-A-0052)
I THINK THAT THERE WAS DEFINITELY A NEED FOR A WAG THE DOG TYPE OF AH SCENARIO TO PLAY OUT THERE BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE AWFULLY CLOSE TO MR BUSH  (fe_03_00388-A-0053)
AND AB- WELL THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT  (fe_03_00388-A-0054)

IT'S REMARKED ON OUTSIDE THIS COUNTRY YOU KNOW IN IN THE NEWSPAPERS IN INDIA AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY IN INDIA AND ALSO IN THE JUST THE PEOPLE THAT I TALK TO UM  (fe_03_00388-A-0058)
THEY THEY WOULD TURN AND ASK ME WHAT BASICALLY THEY'D SAY WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WHY IS THIS PERSON ACTING LIKE THIS  (fe_03_00388-A-0059)
AND REALLY THERE WAS A THERE WAS A GENERAL BAFFLEMENT UM  (fe_03_00388-A-0060)
AND I THINK IN ANOTHER AH ANOTHER AH WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THIS MY EXPERIENCE AS HAV- SOMEONE WHO'S LIVED IN THE THIRD WORLD FOR MANY YEARS I LIVED IN INDIA FOR ABOUT SIX YEARS AND AND DONE A LOT OF TRAVELLING UM  (fe_03_00388-A-0061)
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS AH EXTREMELY INSULAR AND HAS A VERY SHORT ATTENTION SPAN  (fe_03_00388-A-0062)
[MN] AND WHEN I I'D LOOK AT UM I REMEMBER I THINK IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA WAS VISITING THE UNITED STATES AND DID A JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH CLINTON  (fe_03_00388-A-0063)
AND THERE WAS EXACTLY ONE QUESTION ASKED ABOUT INDIA OR PAKISTAN OR THE ENTIRE AH  (fe_03_00388-A-0064)
THAT ENTIRE HALF OF THE WORLD UM BY THE TEAM OF WASHINGTON PRESS CORPS AND EVERYTHING ELSE WAS AH CONCERNED WITH CLINTON'S DOMESTIC POLICIES  (fe_03_00388-A-0065)
AND  (fe_03_00388-A-0066)
WELL IT IS ABSURD AND THAT IT GOT PLAYED UP RATHER STRONGLY IN THE INDIAN PRESS THAT THAT EFFECTIVELY AMERICANS DON'T KNOW DAMN ALL ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD AND THEY DON'T CARE  (fe_03_00388-A-0067)
AND UNFORTUNATELY WELL THERE'S A THERE'S AH WELL OVER A BILLION PEOPLE IN INDIA RIGHT NOW THAT'S MORE THAN THERE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES AMERICA IS NOT IN THE MAJORITY  (fe_03_00388-A-0068)

AND IN IN FACT THERE WAS AH A GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT DURING THE PREVIOUS SPATE OF AH MUSCLE FLEXING BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN WHERE IT REALLY SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A BORDER WAR  (fe_03_00388-A-0073)
UM THE PEOPLE FROM THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR ACTUALLY AH GOT TOGETHER IN A SORT OF CONSORTIUM AND WENT TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA AND SAID YOU MUST STOP THIS IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS  (fe_03_00388-A-0074)
AND A LOT OF THE THE REAL PROBLEM THERE AND THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH I THINK WE'RE WE CAN  (fe_03_00388-A-0075)
HARKING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CONCERN AH THAT WAS ADDRESSED IN OUR OUR CONVERSATIONAL SUBJECT WHAT COUNTRIES ARE ARE  (fe_03_00388-A-0076)
AH REFLECT ON THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES I THINK THAT THERE'S A VERY VERY HIGH POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA IN THE NEAR FUTURE  (fe_03_00388-A-0077)
AH I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL I HAVE FAMILY IN INDIA AND FRIENDS OVER THERE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND I I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE MY PEOPLE WOULD DIE BUT  (fe_03_00388-A-0078)
BUT BUT MORE TO THE POINT IN A BROAD GENERAL WAY  (fe_03_00388-A-0079)
JUST BECAUSE TWO COUNTRIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE GET INTO A WAR AND BLOW UP MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S IRRELEVANT TO THE UNITED STATES' SECURITY IT MEANS THAT IT IT WOULD AH GROSSLY DESTABILIZE THE AH  (fe_03_00388-A-0080)
AH THE NATURE OF OF WORLD POLITICS RIGHT NOW AND I I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AH THAT THAT REALLY TERRIFIES ME  (fe_03_00388-A-0081)
