UM I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY WAY AROUND IT RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_00398-A-0019)
AND I I SEE THE SAME THING I HAVE TEENAGERS  (fe_03_00398-A-0020)
AND I MEAN THEY USE THEIR COMPUTERS FOR EVERYTHING AND I HAVE STUDENTS IN FIRST SECOND THIRD GRADE THAT I'M DOING UM STUDENT TEACHING WITH RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_00398-A-0021)
AND THEY EVEN USE THE COMPUTERS FOR UM  (fe_03_00398-A-0022)
JUST ALL KINDS OF STUFF AT SCHOOL THAT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WITH KIDS WITH DISABILITIES IT'S JUST A HUGE HELP TO THEM  (fe_03_00398-A-0023)
YEAH  (fe_03_00398-A-0024)
YEAH SO UM IT IT'S JUST IT'S SUCH AS BIG HELP 'CAUSE THERE ARE ALL THESE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT AUTOMATICALLY SPELL CORRECT FOR THEM THEY DO EVERYTHING FOR THEM  (fe_03_00398-A-0025)
SO IT REALLY IS A BIG HELP TO THEM  (fe_03_00398-A-0026)
WELL I THINK IT HARD FOR KIDS TO EVEN WRITE SOME OF 'EM DON'T HAVE ANY HAVE VERY GOOD EVEN COORDINATION  (fe_03_00398-A-0027)
AND  (fe_03_00398-A-0028)
THE SPELLING REALLY TRIPS 'EM UP  (fe_03_00398-A-0029)
SO IF YOU'VE A GOT A COMPUTER THAT CAN SPELL OR HELP WITH SPELLING OR EVEN DO SPELL CHECK  (fe_03_00398-A-0030)
IT JUST REALLY HELPS THEM A LOT SO THEY DON'T CAUGHT UP SO MUCH IN TRYING TO SPELL THAT LIMITS THEM IN WHAT THEY WANNA WRITE CREATIVELY  (fe_03_00398-A-0031)
SO I THINK IT REALLY HELPS BUT YOU KNOW I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT ON THAT BUT THAT'S HOW IT SEEMS TO ME YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00398-A-0032)
SO  (fe_03_00398-A-0033)
SOME OF THE KIDS YEAH IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO HOLD THE PENCIL  (fe_03_00398-A-0034)
AND I'VE EVEN WORKED WITH KIDS WITH AUTISM WHERE IT'S JUST IT'S SO NECESSARY TO HAVE A COMPUTER  (fe_03_00398-A-0035)
OF SOME KIND BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WRITE  (fe_03_00398-A-0036)
SO IT'S THEIR MEANS OF COMMUNICATING  (fe_03_00398-A-0037)
BUT UM JUST NORMAL EVERYDAY AVERAGE TEENAGERS THAT I HAVE I JUST I SEE THEM DOING COMING HOME AND DOING POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS I MEAN THINGS THAT ARE SO FAR BEYOND WHAT I EVER COULD HAVE DONE IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_00398-A-0038)
IT JUST WASN'T AVAILABLE YOU KNOW SO I SEE THEM BEING MUCH FARTHER AHEAD PROFESSIONALLY EVEN WHEN THEY GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_00398-A-0039)
JUST BECAUSE OF HAVING THAT ACCESS TO COMPUTERS NOW  (fe_03_00398-A-0040)

RIGHT  (fe_03_00398-A-0046)
RIGHT AH IS THIS I JUST THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_00398-A-0047)
COMPUTERS ARE JUST BECOMING A NECESSITY AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY WAY AROUND IT  (fe_03_00398-A-0048)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_00398-A-0049)
YEAH  (fe_03_00398-A-0051)
THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT  (fe_03_00398-A-0052)
YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE  (fe_03_00398-A-0053)
I CAN SEE WHY THEY WOULD SAY THAT  (fe_03_00398-A-0054)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR WIFE THINKS BUT I CAN SEE HOW THEY'RE A BIG DISTRACTION FOR CERTAIN KIDS  (fe_03_00398-A-0055)
ESPECIALLY BOYS  (fe_03_00398-A-0056)
SOME OF THE LITTLE BOYS WITH [LAUGHTER] ATTENTION DEFICIT OR WHATEVER UM THEY JUST IT'S IT'S A IT'S A REAL DRAW TO THEM AND THEY JUST GET KIND OF STUCK ON IT AND THEY IT IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO INTERACT AND THOSE ARE THE KIDS THAT REALLY NEED INTERACTION  (fe_03_00398-A-0057)
SO I CAN SEE WHY THEY MIGHT SAY THAT  (fe_03_00398-A-0058)
BUT IT WOULD SEEM LIKE IT MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE IT FOR LIMITED PERIODS OF TIME MAYBE YOU KNOW A HALF HOUR A DAY OR SOMETHING WHERE OR IT WAS LIKE A REWARD KIND OF THING OR YOU NOW JUST AH  (fe_03_00398-A-0059)
MAYBE  (fe_03_00398-A-0060)
SOME TIME SPENT BUT YOU KNOW NOT THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE ALL DAY BUT THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME IT WAS AVAILABLE TO THE KIDS  (fe_03_00398-A-0061)
I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_00398-A-0062)
I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY'RE CAPABLE SOME OF THESE KIDS AREN'T REALLY CAPABLE OF UM COMMUNICATING  (fe_03_00398-A-0063)
AND SOME OF THEM CAN'T REALLY SPEAK VERY WELL  (fe_03_00398-A-0064)
BUT IF THEY HAVE SOME OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATING AND THEY CAN USE IT AND IT WORKS FOR THEM THEN YEAH I THINK THE SCHOOL PROBABLY SHOULD PROVIDE IT BUT I THINK MOST SCHOOLS HAVE IT NOW YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00398-A-0065)
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A MATTER OF WHETHER THEY  (fe_03_00398-A-0066)
WHETHER IT'S AVAILABLE OR NOT I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF  (fe_03_00398-A-0067)
WHETHER IT'S PROVIDED FOR THEM IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING  (fe_03_00398-A-0068)
RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_00398-A-0069)

UM  (fe_03_00398-A-0075)
I I I SEE BOTH SIDES OF THAT BUT I THINK  (fe_03_00398-A-0076)
IT IT'S HARD TO SAY BUT SOME KIDS ARE JUST SO DISABLED THAT THEY REALLY NEED IT TO DO THEIR WORK AND IN THAT CASE YOU KNOW I THINK BY ALL MEANS PROVIDE IT BUT IT'S IT'S A HARD CALL IT REALLY IS YOU KNOW IT REALLY DEPENDS ON EACH INDIVIDUAL I THINK WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_00398-A-0077)

RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_00398-B-0032)
YEAH CERTAINLY IN THE WORKPLACE YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS LIKE POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS AND SPREADSHEETS AND DO DOCUMENTS ON WORD SO IF IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE LEARNING HOW TO DO THAT ALREADY IN SCHOOL THAT'S A GREAT ADVANTAGE  (fe_03_00398-B-0033)
THAN HAVING TO LEARN IT WE HAVE PEOPLE AH WHERE I WORK WHO YOU KNOW DIDN'T HAVE ALL THAT THAT THAT LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_00398-B-0034)
AND I SOMETIMES FORGET LIKE I'LL SOMETIMES TELL SOME PEOPLE D- DO ME A SPREADSHEET REAL QUICK THAT THAT THAT DOES THE FOLLOWING AND THEY'D BE LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A SPREADSHEET  (fe_03_00398-B-0035)

RIGHT MY WIFE WORKS AT A UM NURSERY SCHOOL SHE HAS FOUR YEAR OLDS IN HER CLASS AND THE NURSERY SCHOOL DIRECTOR HAS TOLD THEM THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE A COMPUTER IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE SHE THINKS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS TO SPEND YOU KNOW THEIR WHOLE TIME SOCIALIZING  (fe_03_00398-B-0037)
AND SHE THINKS THAT IF THEY HAD COMPUTERS THEY WOULD YOU KNOW JUST INTERACT WITH THE COMPUTER AND NOT LEARN TO SOCIALIZE AND I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT AND  (fe_03_00398-B-0038)
'CAUSE I'M NOT A TEACHER SO I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU HAVE THAT PERSPECTIVE  (fe_03_00398-B-0040)

RIGHT RIGHT BUT YOU TOLD ME YOU'RE WORKING WITH SOME KIDS WHO HAVE P._D._D. SO  (fe_03_00398-B-0046)
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THAT THE SCHOOL SHOULD SORT OF ACCOMMODATE THEM BY PROVIDING THEM WITH A COMPUTER WHICH IS YOU KNOW HELPS THEM TO WRITE ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T HELP THEIR INTERACTIONAL SKILLS  (fe_03_00398-B-0047)
OR SHOULD KIND OF FIGHT AGAINST THEIR NATURAL INCLINATION AND MAKE THEM INTERACT WHEN WHEN I THINK A P._D._D. KID DOESN'T WANT TO OFTEN OR IS EMBARASSED BY TRYING TO INTERACT  (fe_03_00398-B-0048)

SO WE'LL PROVIDE THE COMPUTER AS A KIND OF COMPANION OR A HELPER TO GET THE ACADEMIC WORK DONE OR YOU CAN GO THE OPPOSITE WAY AND SAY NO WHAT THIS KID NEEDS IS TO BE SORT OF FORCED TO SOCIALIZE AND SO WE'RE TAKE THE COMPUTER AWAY  (fe_03_00398-B-0054)

AND AH I ALSO GUESS THAT THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION E- EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE WILL PHILOSOPHICALLY FALL ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER YOU KNOW THIS IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT AG- FIGHT AGAINST YOU KNOW F- FORCE KIDS TO DO THINGS THAT THEY DON'T DO NATURALLY I THINK CAN BE OVEREX-  (fe_03_00398-B-0059)
OVEREXTENDED YOU KNOW SO THAT THE SCHOOL BECOMES KIND OF ANTAGONISTIC TOWARD THEM IF IT'S TRYING TO GET YOU KNOW KIDS TO SOCIALIZE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THAT'S  (fe_03_00398-B-0060)
YOU KNOW THEIR DISABILITY MAKES IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM AND AND THAT RUNS AGAINST THEIR INCLINATION I THINK WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS NOT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE FORCED TO DO SOMETHING BUT RATHER TO FIND WAYS TO ENCOURAGE THEM OR FIND WAYS TO WORK AROUND THE DISABILITY  (fe_03_00398-B-0061)
SO DID YOU UM HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH DISABLED KIDS ALL ALONG OR IS THIS YOUR NEW CONCENTRATION SINCE YOU'VE GONE BACK TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_00398-B-0062)

I THINK THEY'RE THE BEST THING UM SHE LEARNED HOW TO READ FOR EXAMPLE FROM FROM COMPUTER GAMES  (fe_03_00398-B-0076)

[MN] FOR A._D._D. I I THINK IT IS THE CASE THAT WE OVER DIAGNOSE  (fe_03_00398-B-0081)
UM FOR OTHER DISABILITIES I DON'T THINK IT'S THE CASE THAT WE OVER DIAGNOSE BUT THAT WE SORT OF CREATED THEM UM YOU KNOW THESE ARE KIDS WHO UNDER A LESS DEMANDING SCHOOL SITUATION WOULD NOT HAVE A DISABILITY IN SOME SENSE BEC-  (fe_03_00398-B-0082)
