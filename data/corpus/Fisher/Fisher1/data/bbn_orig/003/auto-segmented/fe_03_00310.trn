LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY I I'VE SEEN THEM PUT PEOPLE IN EMBARRASSING SITUATIONS  (fe_03_00310-A-0049)
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT  (fe_03_00310-A-0050)
THEY WANT THIS TO BE OUT IN THE OPEN AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT WHEN WHEN THEY START SAYING OKAY YOU KNOW LIKE  (fe_03_00310-A-0051)
LET'S SEE YOUR BELT AND LIKE PULL OFF YOUR BELT AND NOW ROLL START START ROLLING DOWN THE HEM OF THE TOP OF YOUR DRESS AND STUFF LIKE THAT AND I GO WAIT A MINUTE  (fe_03_00310-A-0052)

YOU KNOW I'M SURE IT'S THERE  (fe_03_00310-A-0060)
WELL AT THE AIRPORT I'M SURE IT'S THERE  (fe_03_00310-A-0061)
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S OUT TO DO THE SORT OF BRAZEN LOOK AT WHAT WE GOT WE DARE YOU TO DO ANYTHING KIND OF THING  (fe_03_00310-A-0062)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_00310-A-0063)
SO YEAH I KIND OF DISAGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE A POLICE STATE AND  (fe_03_00310-A-0064)
I I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A NEED FOR THAT AND THANK GOD THAT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT DO THAT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT AIRPORT SECURITY HAS TO GO TO THAT THAT  (fe_03_00310-A-0065)
WELL FRANKLY IS THAT I I THINK THAT THE SCREENING PROCESS IS ALL WRONG BECAUSE IF YOU DID FIND SOMEBODY WHAT IN THE HECK ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THEM  (fe_03_00310-A-0066)
I MEAN HERE YOU'RE STANDING WITH THE LARGEST ALMOST THE LARGEST DENSITY OF PEOPLE WHEN THERE IS A RUSH RIGHT THERE AT THE SCREENING  (fe_03_00310-A-0067)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH YOU KNOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FIND THE NEAREST EXIT GOOD LUCK  (fe_03_00310-A-0068)
YOU KNOW BUT I I I THINK THAT IF THEY DID FIND SOMEONE WHO  (fe_03_00310-A-0069)
WAS REALLY A SECURITY THREAT  (fe_03_00310-A-0070)
WOULD IT REALLY BE INTELLIGENT TO SHAKE 'EM DOWN AMONGST ALL THE REST OF THE FOLKS BECAUSE IF THIS PERSON WAS OF THE MINDSET TO BE THERE WITH  (fe_03_00310-A-0071)
WHAT ANYONE BASICALLY SHOULD KNOW THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE WITH YOU KNOW WEAPONRY OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_00310-A-0072)
YOU KNOW WHY ARE YOU GOING TO JEOPARDIZE THE SECURITY OF ALL THOSE FOLKS AROUND THEM  (fe_03_00310-A-0073)
SO THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A TIERED PROCESS WHERE IF SOMEONE IS IDENTIFIED THEY'RE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH BUT THEY'RE PICKED UP AT SOME OTHER PLACE  (fe_03_00310-A-0074)
WHERE IT IS SAFE AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE FOLKS  (fe_03_00310-A-0075)
RIGHT  (fe_03_00310-A-0077)
WELL  (fe_03_00310-A-0078)
ONE WOULD HOPE THAT WE'RE MORE CIVILIZED THAN THAT  (fe_03_00310-A-0079)
WE REALLY ARE AS TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED AS WE TOUT TO BE  (fe_03_00310-A-0081)
WHY CAN'T WE FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY OF DOING THIS  (fe_03_00310-A-0082)

THAT'S WHAT THEY DID  (fe_03_00310-A-0087)
BUT I I GUESS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET AT WAS THAT IF THERE WAS A TIERED PROCESS  (fe_03_00310-A-0088)
THE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO SCREEN YOU IF YOU DO HAVE TRACES OF UM EXPLOSIVES ON YOU OR CONTRABAND OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE  (fe_03_00310-A-0089)
UM AND I  (fe_03_00310-A-0090)
