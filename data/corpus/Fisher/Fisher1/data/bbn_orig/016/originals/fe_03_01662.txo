L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Ah, my name is Sharon and --
R:  I'm Amber.
L:  Hi, Amber, I'm -- I'm from Evansville, Indiana.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from, um, Ellington, Connecticut.
L:  [MN] Well, it's nice to meet you, Amber.
R:  Nice to meet you too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I had trouble hearing the topic, ah, but I believe it was supposed to be about peace in the Middle East, but the very first, ah, couple of lines that she said was not clear.
R:  Okay.  What she basically said was, um, how do you feel about peace in the Middle East?  Do you think that peace will ever be obtained?  Do you think that the United States should stay involved?  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That's basically what she [NOISE] -- you know, [LAUGH] give or take, ah, little bits, that's basically what she said.
L:  Okay.  Well, you want to start?
R:  Sure.  [LAUGH] Um, you know what, I don't think peace will ever be attained.  I -- I mean, that sounds like a real negative way of looking at it but I don't really think that the, um -- [NOISE] that there's any way that every single person in that area is going to be satisfied.  And without them being satisfied I don't think there will ever be a true peace.
L:  You know, that --
R:  I think there might come a time when the reins [NOISE] are tighter and you keep things under control better.  But I don't really ever think there will a true peace as like what we know in the United States here where you can, you know, express your opinion by a vote or what -- a demonstration or whatever but it doesn't escalate beyond that.  I don't know.  Go -- you go ahead.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I was just going to say that that was my thoughts exactly.  I -- I just -- I just don't see that happening either.  And [MN] I think that whole concept is so foreign over there that they -- they just, I don't really think they truly comprehend that process, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I just don't really see it as -- as happening either.  And I think it's unfortunate.  Um, and as far as the United States staying involved in it, [SIGH] I would love to think we could do something.  [LAUGH] I really would love to think that we could do something but, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, going to war and all, I don't -- I don't really see that as being the answer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm not sure there's a whole lot that we can do that's going to help the situation over there.  I think that we might have to stay involved because we might have to protect our own interests --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, at certain times, especially, like, you know, if you have to go after a terrorist there or you have to, you know, do something that will prevent [NOISE] attacks on the United States.  But I also think that the more our presence in the area is a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- large one, the more it seems to stir up.  It doesn't seem to calm anybody down so --
L:  Absolutely.  And I -- I think because of our presence that, um, you know, it's going to be stirring up more things.  Um --
R:  Yeah, and down the road we're going to pay another price for this.
L:  Yeah, absolutely.
R:  For all the children, you know, y- all you'd have to do is have -- you know, traumatize another generation and then you've got -- [LAUGH] you know what I mean?  It's just another -- a whole wave to deal with and, um, I don't know.  I'm -- I'm hoping, you always hope and pray for the best, but [NOISE] I'm not really, um -- really too optimistic that -- because I -- I just see too many parties whose goals are at odds with each other.  I mean, you even look at Iraq and you look at, okay, now, perhaps they'll still, um, you know, have a peaceful -- a chance at peace and a chance at democracy, but then you've got, like, the Kurds.  Well, the Kurds are tot- they're, um, objectives are totally at odds with being brought under a banner of a- you know, any other -- anybody else anywhere.  And then there's that whole of 'em in Turkey and then Turkey's afraid that their Kurds are gonna rise up, you know what I mean.  So I -- I don't really see that y- you get anywhere, you know, with this whole process, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] An- and the same thing the Palestinians.  If you -- if the +Palestinians are, um -- you know, if they get satisfied if they get land, you're really doing it th- at the expense of Jewish settlers and whatever, who are then going to be [LAUGH] just as radical in the other direction.  So, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I just don't -- I don't think you can just -- you know, you'd need probably like six times more of the exact same land for everybody to be [LAUGH] -- you know what I mean, everybody to be able to do exactly what they wanted.?
L:  Right.  A- a- and that's not a possibility either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  And -- and United States, our interests are -- are kind of like -- usually are not the interests of either side, you know what I mean?  Our interests are in addition to everybody else's interests.  So you've got, you know, like the Palestinians' interests, the Israelis' interests and then our interests.  And I don't think any three of them -- a- any, you know, two of the three are the same thing.  So I -- us getting involved, I think, [LAUGH] is muddying the water in most cases, especially that situation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I -- I think at this point we've got to stay involved in Iraq.  I mean, y- we're in there, we, you know, uprooted the whole country.  At that p- -- this point we can't withdraw and leave a mess so I -- don't think we're --
L:  And it is a mess.  I mean, look what happened.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, everybody just went wild over there.
R:  Right.  So, I think at this point we owe it to the people.  If we've toppled one government we owe it to them to stay there until there is at least some hopes of another stable government.  So I don't think you're gonna get out, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're going to be able to pull out from that but --
L:  I'm curious.  It was on CNN today, um, they were talking about you know, the news media was asking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is it possible that we would set up a -- a base over there.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, and, ah, of course the response was, "Probably not likely" but it -- it seemed to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But the news media thought -- seemed to think that that would be a good idea, [LAUGH] to have a permanent US base over there now.
R:  In -- in -- in Iraq?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, it just seems like one more place that, um, you're gonna put people into danger.  Um, I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, servicemen, you know.  If you -- you put a -- you -- you're gonna get another USS Cole or you're gonna get another bombing of their headquarters or something like what's going on, because you're just putting them in harm's way.  And I don't -- I'm not sure really what you would be gaining.
L:  Well, I got the impression that that was not gonna happen but ...
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  Well, I -- I kinda hope not.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  'Cause I think if anything's going to radicalize the population [LAUGH] something like that is, because that's gonna prove to them what they've been afraid of all along, and that is that we're trying to take over the region --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and dictate to 'em.  And I think that it's in our best interest at this point to prove to them that that's not what we're going to do.  But I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Nobody listens to [LAUGH] people at our level anyway, right?
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't know.  It just seems like even if you -- even if you had the power to make anything at all occur in that area, that you wanted to occur, you know, like you just -- you know, overnight it would happen.  I'm not even sure then I would be able to tell you a good plan, you know, what-- what is a good plan.  But also they have been at war for how many ...?
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  You know, thousands of years they've --
L:  Right.
R:  -- been at war in that area.  It's not like this is anything new.  It shouldn't really surprise anybody.  You know, even in the Bible they were -- [LAUGH] the same g- groups of people were at war with each other.  So, um -- I mean, that's a long time ago.
L:  [MN] Well, it seems like we're -- we're pretty much in total agreement on this issue. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I don't know.  Yo- you kind of wonder -- I suppose there are some real radical opinions but even then -- I mean, like I heard a lot of people say -- say, like, be against the war but I didn't hear a whole lot of people who were against the war that had another plan.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?  So how -- how do you ac- achieve your objectives?  Well, it's one thing to be against something but I think that you also then should have an alternative.  Um, I don't know.  Maybe they thought that, you know, just going on the same path was an alternative.  And -- I mean, I don't -- I guess that would have been, although it didn't seem like it was working.  But anyway --
L:  But are we sure that this is working? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure.
L:  I'm not either.
R:  Yeah.  We don't -- we don't, um, have a lot of, um -- like, we don't have a television in our hou- home and so we don't -- we get most of our information either from magazines or from newspapers or -- either that or from the radio.  So it's not like I've been having constant exposure to what's going on either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the papers today said that they had found chemical -- or the -- the precursors of chemical weapons in Iraq.
L:  Yes.
R:  So it looks like that going in there anyw-
