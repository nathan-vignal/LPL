L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Andy.
L:  Hi, this is Stephanie.
R:  Hi Stephanie, how are you?
L:  Just fine.
R:  Good.  Well, [LAUGH] an interesting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- an interesting topic.
L:  Yes, it is. [MN]
R:  [LAUGH].  So what -- what do you think? 
L:  Well, I don't know.  There was a lot to -- to have to talk about there.  Um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that peace will never be brought -- what was it, peace to be brought over there? 
R:  Yeah, ahah.
L:  Yeah, I don't think they'll ever arrive at peace but I think they will try to come to peace. [COUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yep, well, I -- I agree with you there.  I don't think there ever will be.
L:  And I com- -- I agree completely that the US should be over there helping them.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I think that was one of the things. 
R:  Yep, I would -- I would agree with that as well I think, yeah.  Um, you know, it's going to be a challenge to maintain our -- our involvement in a -- in a -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- way that's acceptable to -- to both the Middle East and the rest of the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, -- but, ah, it -- it perhaps can be done.  I think the real challenge is going to be seeing how we deal with this first step of Iraq and getting a -- a stable government established so ... 
L:  And how they are going to accept it because they have lived in this type of environment since Jesus's time and that's, you know, going to be something to have to overcome on their part because it's gonna be so completely different, I think.
R:  Yep.  Well, I -- I -- yes, I mean, I think the -- the, ah, um, democratic rule, um, is a little bit, ah, ah, unusual for -- for that part of the world.  I'm sure it will be interesting to see how -- if it can be established and -- and once it is established, if it can be maintained. Um, ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I do think that they should have done this years and years ago, ah, you know, they should have, you know, at least gotten all those terrorists out of there and got them under control whenever they first had the chance.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's a difficult -- a difficult question.  The -- the -- the relative ease of which it was done this time, ah, was probably due in a large part to the fact that -- that we have had --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ah, a number of years of -- of time to improve the technology and to, ah, -- to be able to precision bomb and so forth and so had it been -- had it been done in the first Gulf War that would have -- that would have been the -- the best time to -- to do it, um, but you never know what -- what the results would have been then so I guess --
L:  That's true, yeah. 
R:  -- better late than never.
L:  Yeah, you never know.
R:  So, yeah.  Ahah.
L:  So, do you think that they will arrive at peace? 
R:  No, I -- I don't think they will because, ah, I mean for there to be peace in the Middle -- Middle East, um, there has to be peace with Israel and there won't -- won't be peace with Israel ah, -- ah, -- ah, until the Lord comes so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, that a -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's a challenge that -- that won't be met until then.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Yeah, but I do -- I really do think that they are gonna try but it is going to be extremely difficult I think for them to -- to [NOISE] learn how to -- to live a completely different way, you know.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I agree but -- but, um, people are -- people are pretty adaptable and -- and, ah, so there will be -- there will be a lot of sorting out but fortunately in --  in Iraq there's -- there's a pretty good, um, basic internal structure in terms of roads and, um, you know, utilities and -- and that type of thing so ... 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  Um, there's certainly a long way to go but, ah, I think that, um, that it won't take as long as -- as it might in another country that, um, was further more backward.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, you think?  See, I don't know.  You know, I have never really studied the other places but I would think that like Africa would be, you know, faster to -- to catch on to democracy than -- than like the Israelites and stuff like that.
R:  I don't know, it's an interesting, ah, -- it's an interesting thought, um.  I think the -- I think one of the differences and one of the reasons that -- that democracy, um, ah, works is because there is a capitalistic mentality of -- of trying to build and -- and, ah, improve, ah, improve, ah, overall life and -- and to have people who in that structure, ah, you know, foreign companies create jobs and -- and, you know, really -- really go about trying to -- to create an economic prosperity and I think that situation is probably further -- um, further along than perhaps some areas of Africa and, um, but, ah, ... 
L:  [NOISE] I never thought of it that way --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- but I guess that's right, you know. 
R:  Mhm, so, --
L:  It's just we -- we have friends that are missionaries over in Africa and they are so open to -- to different ideas whereas I don't know if Iraq is going to be that open, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they are going to be just scared and afraid and everything's just gonna be so different for them.
R:  Well, I -- I -- I think they -- they have certainly seen what much of the rest of the world lives like and -- and they -- they, ah, um, -- they are going -- they're obviously overreacting to, um, you know, not having a government control.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and, ah, so -- but I think by the same token they, ah, um, um, you know, that -- that if that's contained and a structure is brought in -- I think the challenge is going to be in -- in who gets the nod as the -- as the leader of choice, ah, to set up a new government and that's -- that's gonna be very difficult because th- th- there are very differing, ah, religious sects and -- and all, ah, that are there.  Like, it, ah, um, extremely challenging to put in a kind of a -- of a united government together I think.
L:  Yeah.  I am trying to look down to see what time it is here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Three more minutes. [MN] Um, ... 
R:  So.
L:  I can't remember the other things that they said to talk about.  World peace.
R:  Really. Go ahead.
L:  World peace.  What else was the other ones? 
R:  Um, I don't remember either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, um, ... yeah, it's been a pretty -- a pretty amazing few weeks.
L:  Yes, it has.
R:  Since it started, so ... 
L:  Yeah, and it's amazing in comparison to, you know, like past wars -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the --  the updating and -- and people are able to get information right away and stuff like that. Whereas --
R:  It really is, ah, it really is incredible.
L:  Yeah, it is.  I don't know if I really like it that much or not but [LAUGH] ... 
R:  Well you have a choice as to whether you watch it or not I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If -- if it didn't exist then you wouldn't -- then you wouldn't have a choice to -- to, ah, be able to turn it down and I think, you know, at a point it -- it became very repetitive and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and not really, ah, informative.  By the same token you -- you knew that they were there -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and that if there was anything that was significant that was taking place that, ah, we would probably hear about it so ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, that's -- I think that's a very different way to -- to fight a war and -- and, um, so I think -- I think overall it was, ah, it was very positive.  Like I say, you can choose to turn it off and ignore it or, ah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or participate.
L:  Well, you know, I was --  I was just thinking of the people that had family and -- and friends there that, you know, I would be, like, glued if one of my family members were there and then it would be upsetting knowing that troop was there and then, you know, casualties and not knowing.
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, well I -- 
L:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
R:  Sure.  What part of the country are you in? 
L:  Arizona.
R:  Arizona.
L:  Arizona.  Where are you at? 
R:  I'm in Dallas.
L:  Ah.  Is it hot? 
R:  Oh, it's been beautiful the weather here so.
L:  It's cloudy today.
R:  It's been terrific.
L:  It's got a lot of overcast.
R:  A very nice spring, so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm. Very good. Very good.
L:  One more minute. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You have -- you have got it on the timer.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  How many of these -- how many of these have you done? 
L:  This is my third one. [MN]
R:  Ahah, my second one, so.
L:  Yeah, the first one was -- oh, I can't even remember what it was now.
