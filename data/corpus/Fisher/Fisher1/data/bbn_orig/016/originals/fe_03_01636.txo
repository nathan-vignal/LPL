R:  Hello.  My name's Dawn.
L:  Hi, I'm Ray.
R:  Hi.  Okay, so the topic of the day is what we think about the Middle East.
L:  Yeah, that's what I gathered from it.  Um. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Okay.  Ah, oh, um, personally I didn't agree with, ah, Bush going to war.  Ah, they should have found the smoking gun, I think, first.  And then I don't think peace will be found in the Middle East because they haven't found Saddam, dead or alive, and he'll come back.  Or somebody else will take his place.  Ah [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Go on.
L:  Um, I pretty much think that, well, [NOISE] we should go over there and [NOISE] stop them from whatever they're doing.  'Cause the way I see it, Saddam is a pretty dangerous guy and he's got stuff hidden somewhere and they've been doing it for, like twelve years [NOISE] since the last war [NOISE] with them so, ah ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, he is dangerous.  But, you know, it's like -- like, they say he had weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons.  We have chemical weapons, the United States has -- has chemical weapons, you know?  And then they were talking about how he has these missiles, long range firing missiles that he wasn't supposed to have.  Well, we have weapon power, why can't they?  That's what I didn't --
L:  Well --
R:  -- understand about it.
L:  [NOISE] Also the way, um, America's set up is our government's too chicken to use anything like that.  If we had to we probably would, but only if we had to.  Then they will just attack us for no apparent reason.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just they're pissed off at us because I don't know why but ...
R:  I think they're pissed off at us because we are butting our nose into their business.  That's what I --
L:  Yeah.  That's true too but [NOISE] [MN] ah, also we're looking like -- ah, from the last war when we just kind of left we're kind of looking pretty bad for that.  So I think, ah, [NOISE] Bush was just wanting to, you know, make it seem like we were a strong country and we weren't just a bunch of chickens running scared. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, he wanted to take up where his dad left off.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, [MN] yeah, I -- I think somebody will take Saddam's place.  It's just a matter of time, you know.  It's just a matter of time before Osama strikes us again 'cause they haven't found him.  And if they find him somebody else will take his place.  There's never going to be peace.
L:  No.
R:  As long as history has been around, since the beginning of time there's always been war.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There's always been dictators.  It's ...
L:  [NOISE] Just like with World War One.  They stopped Germany once.  They rose up and there was World War Two.  Ah --
R:  Yep, exactly, yeah.
L:  I mean, [NOISE] war is a -- war's pretty much just a simple solution that doesn't really solve anything.
R:  Yes.  I agree with you there.  It doesn't solve anything.  I- in some cases it makes matters worse.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Wh- -- ah, what do you think of, ah -- do you think s- somebody will come and take Saddam's place again?
L:  Um, [NOISE] I don't think he's dead.  I don't think he really needs to -- anyone's going to have to take his place.  Ah, h- him and Osama Bin Laden are probably hanging out somewhere in the mountains.  And they're just --
R:  You think -- [MN] you're think they're like partners in crime?
L:  [NOISE] Um, not -- not necessarily like partners in crime but pretty much like, ah, they're both on the -- they're both -- they're both against America so it's just kind of like they're, ah, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  They're just kind of stuck together in that matter.
R:  Yeah, they're both against America but I think that their egos are too big.  They want to have the satisfaction of bringing America down, you know.  They want to have all that glory.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So I don't -- I don't think -- some people think, you know, that -- that they're conspiring together and working together and I don't think so.  I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- each one wants to have the satisfaction, have the glory of, "Well, we did America in".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now that's what I think.
L:  [NOISE] You're probably right in that matter.  Both of them probably do think that they're -- that they should be the ones who, ah, finish out their duties. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're going to try and see which one does it first.
R:  Yup, exactly, yeah.  Yup.  You know some people even thought that Sa- -- ah, that I talked to thought that Saddam had something to do with nine eleven --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that he was in it with Osama.  And I was li- -- I didn't think so at all.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm sure they at least knew about what was [NOISE] going on between it.  [NOISE] At the very least I'm sure they did 'cause, you know, [NOISE] over there I'm sure stuff gets around just like it does here in America.
R:  Yeah, I, ah, I'm s- yeah, I'm sure it does too.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  And, I mean, there mi- there might have been just like a little bit of conspiring on it but it wasn't like Saddam Hussein was in the major thing of it.  I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  He might have, like, contributed like, ah, I don't know, some information or something.  That was probably about it.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  He probably gave information, but yeah ...
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Do you think they'll find Saddam?
L:  No.
R:  No?  I don't think so either, just like they will never find Osama.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I mean, even if they could produce some, like -- like teeth that matched his dental record.  But [NOISE] they can't find anything.
R:  Yeah.  And that's a ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like a- after nine eleven they were finding -- they found at least something of somebody, [NOISE] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to match up who was missing and everything like that.  But this, I mean, there was what, like -- there couldn't have been [NOISE] twenty people in that house.
R:  No.
L:  How hard would it be to find anyone.
R:  Really, yeah.  Somebody probably gave 'em a heads up and they probably took off.
L:  Yeah, 'cause there's, like, hidden tunnels under the whole city and stuff from what I understand. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's what I understand too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, we'll have to see how it goes.  I -- I think there will be another dictator to take Saddam's place.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  If not -- if not there, somewhere else.  I mean, there's gonna -- there's always gonna be another dictator right behind him.
R:  Yup.
L:  Just like we're having problems with, what is it, like, Korea, I think?
R:  Yes, yeah, and their nuclear weapons.  Yup.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, bu- -- and, ah, Bush is now saying that -- that Syria is -- possibly has chemical weapons and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, is, ah, hiding out the, ah, the Iraqis.  Yeah.
L:  See, Bush's problem is he's going to take on too many things at one time.  We're going to be fighting Korea, Syria, Iraq and Osama Bin Laden --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all in one swoop.
R:  [LAUGH] Yup, exactly.  He's biting off more than he can chew.
L:  Yup.  And we don't have that many people to back us up.
R:  No, we don't.  We don't.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No, but -- and I can understand that.  I mean, they don't want to get involved.  They don't want, you know, people to start attacking their country.
L:  Yeah, I mean, France, they, ah [NOISE] -- I -- I think that they should've at least been behind us but other than that I don't see why anyone else would. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Considering we kept them from being taken over in World War One and World War Two ... [NOISE]
R:  Yup.
L:  I figured --
R:  Yup, they should've backed us up but they didn't.  I disagreed with that one too but the other ones, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Russia, they have no reason to.  I mean, we were at the cold war for how long?
R:  Yeah, God, like two decades, three decades.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  Forever. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] We've pretty much gotten involved in some of the most pointless wars in history.
R:  Yup, we have and it hasn't done us any good.  We don't benefit from it.
L:  [NOISE] No, there's only two wars we've really benefited from.  That was the Civil War and, ah, the revolutionary war.  That was it.
R:  Yes.  Yup, I agree.  Everything else -- and then, like, what happens now, like, with Iraq now that Saddam's gone for now?  We got to take over and rebuild their country.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.
R:  And that's what makes me mad.  I mean, they're giving, what, Iraq, like seventy billion or something to rebuild their country when we need that money here.  No, that's wrong.
L:  Yeah, they're cutting like fifty percent on our California school budget to fund Iraq.
R:  Yup.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, they're cutting -- they're -- ah, here in, ah, Utah they're talking about taking away, ah, extra curricular activities so that parents have to pay for it.
L:  Yup.
R:  And if that happens then -- then
