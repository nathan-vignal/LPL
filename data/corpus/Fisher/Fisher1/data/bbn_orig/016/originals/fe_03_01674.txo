L:  Oh hi, I'm Chanrun[?].  I'm from, uh, Ann Arbor, Michigan.
R:  Hi, I'm Stephanie and I'm from Champaign[?], Illinois. 
L:  Oh, University of Illinois?
R:  Yes, mm, yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Big --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- rivals here.  [LAUGH]
L:  What?
R:  I said w- w- w- I think we are -- we're rivals probably with Ann Arbor.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, pretty much, but I'm actually from California, so it doesn't really matter.
R:  Oh okay, then it -- it's all right then.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about the Middle East.
R:  Yes, yeah.  [LAUGH]  It's a broad [LAUGH] -- hot topic, I guess, right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So what are -- what was the first question?  If peace will ever be attained?  What's your opinions on that?
L:  I -- I -- I don't know.  It's -- it's -- it's, um, given America's current, uh, attitudes towards, um, [MN] uh, the state of Palestine or the formation of a state of Palestine, I -- I don't -- I don't know if -- if it'll be any time soon that peace will be attained.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What do you think?
R:  Well, um, actually, it's kind of interesting, 'cause, um, I -- my -- I'm a Christian, so a lot of the -- at least it's interesting to see how, um, a lot of the stuff, like biblically, it coincides with what is going on right now as far as -- just different prophecy and things in the Christian or just as far as, like, how over in, like, the Middle East area how it's just -- um, there's going to be a lot of conflict there and how, like, a lot of, like, Babylon and stuff, you know, that's in present day Iraq, [COUGH] um, that, like, plays a part in everything, so I think [NOISE] because of that, until we -- you know, w- we have, like, the end of the world so Christ comes back, then I -- no, I don't think that there will ever be peace there.  I don't think that it's gonna -- and I think it's only going to get worse, I guess.  I mean, I think there'll be a ti--
L:  So --
R:  Oh, go ahead.
L:  So you think that there'll be peace only when Christ comes back?  Is that --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- what you think?
R:  Yes.  Until he -- yeah.  Until he comes back and then -- I mean, I don't know.  Are y- -- are you very familiar with the Christian beliefs as far as 
L:  [MN] w- I went to Catholic high school, so I've had --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I took -- I took courses in Old Testament, but that was many, many, many years ago --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- that, um --  
R:  Well, 'cause, um, with the -- the prophesy as far as, you know, like, whenever God comes back for -- uh, this is -- it's kind of complex, I guess, so -- but since you're kind of probably familiar with some of it as far as -- 'cause, like, in B- -- with Babylon, how they, um, you know, how it was a big, biblical city and how, you know, it was destroyed and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then how, um, Saddam Hussein now kind of has been working to rebuild that.  I don't know, you know, if you were aware of that but, um, and like, scripturally --
L:  Working to rebuild the -- the, uh, Hanging Gardens --
R:  Of Babylon.
L:  -- of Babylon --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so that was kind of -- that's kind of biblically in there, so I think --
L:  So, Saddam --
R:  -- it's kind of interesting how it kind of all works together.
L:  Does -- does the Bible sort of, uh, um, uh, foretell the destruction of Babylon by a very Christian person like George Bush?
R:  No. [LAUGH]  No, actually, when it comes to play it's not going to be, um -- it won't be in, um the US.  It's funny how whenever it kind of -- that comes to play, the US really isn't in the picture much as far as whenever God returns, like, it's more a -- it's a Middle Eastern country that kind of takes --
L:  But -- but do they talk about intervention by a large Christian power like the Unite- -- you know, like the United States would be considered?  You know, like some sort of a Christian king coming to Babylon and destroying it once again, or -- or going -- or, you know --
R:  No.
L:  -- somehow settling it?
R:  No, uh, yeah, I know, I know it doesn't.  And actually, 'cause I don't believe that this is the end time here, whatever, that this is God coming back, you know?  But I just think, um, some of the things that prophesied, like, I think some of these events, and I don't know what even these events that are happening now, what exactly they have to do, you know, how exactly it'll play out, but I just think it's kind of precursors, if you will, does that kinda makes sense as far as, like, to how things in -- like, whenever God does return, I think it's kind of precursors to that.  I think it's kind of like starting to shape up, because if you look at, like, twenty years ago, Babylon wasn't even considered, you know, in Iraq.  You never heard about -- or not Baby- -- excuse me -- like Iraq wasn't even -- you didn't hear much ab- you know, anything about it, and now it's sort of funny how suddenly, like, it's all over the place, it's all over the world, you know?  And so I just think, like, how the conflict in the Middle East is just kind of -- it's funny --
L:  Well, the conflict in the Middle East seems to be older than Saddam Hussein and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, i- i- it has to do with, um, Israeli occupation and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, displacement of people who were already there.
R:  Yeah, and a- -- 
L:  How do you feel about that?
R:  About the Israeli occu- occupa- -- well, with, um, you know, just -- I don't know if you're very familiar with, like, beginning of time, how, like, you know, Israel being God's chosen people and that sort of thing?  Are you very aware of, like, the -- the biblical history there?
L:  I'm -- I'm aware of it, but more like a comic book.  It doesn't -- I mean, I'm -- I'm a --
R:  Okay, it's not really a --
L:  I'm a -- I'm a scientist and so it -- it -- it really doesn't, um, [SIGH] it doesn't mean much to me, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, just because you're a scientist doesn't have to -- I mean, it's not -- but, I mean, historically --
L:  No, but -- so -- so if, uh, well, what do you mean, historically?  So, I -- I mean, there were other people on the earth --
R:  Yeah.  Oh, oh, definitely.
L:  -- when it [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, w- whenever --
L:  Right?
R:  -- I say God's ch- -- yeah, yeah, whenever I say God's chosen people I don't mean they're the only ones that are going to go to heaven or anybody -- no, I don't mean that at all.  Um, but I don't know if you, like, if you've ever [COUGH] read as far as, like, in, you know, the beginning of ti- -- in, you know, in, like, Genesis and Exodus.  I don't know if you've ev- are very familiar with, like, those, but how it talks about how God chose the people of Israel as his chosen -- chosen people, and as far as the conflict there, like, they were taken out?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I -- I'd really -- I can't -- I'm not -- I know the history but to go through it, it would take forever [several inaudible words].
L:  So you really feel that, like, the -- the current conflict in Palestine is -- is -- is -- is somehow related to what -- what the Torah says or -- or, uh, or what the New Testament says?  I -- I mean, is that a -- really a rational belief on your part?
R:  Well, okay, I -- I can't say that, like, "Okay, what's happening in this verse is like the prophesy is coming true".  But, I mean, I think in -- because, in my belief, God's in control of everything and he's planning out everything, you know?  In his plan, he knows what's going on, he knows what's happening.  So, okay, it may be another -- thousands and thousands of years before actually I b- -- that God does come back, but I believe what's happening now, it does play into a part.  It's kind of like just a sequence of events, I guess.  It's kind of like I said earlier, a precursor, and I -- I do believe that as far as what's going on now, yeah, it is, it's a rational belief.  I mean, I think -- and you would even hear a lot of stories, a lot of scientists kind of -- there is evidence that would support that also.
L:  That would support that -- what the Bible says about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a prophecy about Israel --
R:  Yeah, and just how --
L:  -- and Palestine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is true?
R:  Yeah, and I mean, I'm not --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- forcing that, I'm just saying that, you know, there's opinions both ways --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that would support that.
L:  Now -- now does -- does the Bible pr- um, does the Bible make prophecies about other parts of the world?
R:  You know, I couldn't tell you for sure, because I'm not [LAUGH] --
L:  Is it a wholly myopic, you know, text?  Like, does it talk about, uh, Europe?  Does it talk about Asia, East Asia?  That has a -- has a --
R:  It -- it does talk about -- yes.  Well, you see, a lot of the, um, a lot of what the Bible says as far as, um, different things it's -- it may not say, you know, like if it's talking about I- it won't say, you know, Iraq, because back, you know, when the Bible was written obviously it wasn't called Iraq, so you have to infer from, like, the points that it, you know, like w- geographically where they're speaking of the area, you know, so it doesn't mention -- it doesn't say, like, "You're England" or something, you know?  But there are general text as far as, like, how in -- in times, how there's going to be, like, a joining of all these different nations, and so some people believe that that would be like the joining of many of the European nations.  So   Um, and I -- I wish I was more educated as far as how that work, you know, works.  I need to do better about getting more knowledge on that, but 
L:  Mm.  But you -- but -- but you still somehow hold this to be true without, uh, full knowledge of -- of what --
R:  Well, I guess whatever I say --
L:  -- of what the text says?
R:  Yeah, I guess whenever I say "the knowledge", I have the knowledge, but I wish -- whenever I -- I -- it's in the Bible, and that's where I get my knowledge from, is from the Bible says, so I guess whatever I say of the knowledge, I wish that I knew it -- had it memorized in my head, that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause if I, you know, knew -- if I could look up the verses.  If we had hours I could, you know, give you references from the Bible.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I guess that's what I mean.
L:  I mean --
R:  Yeah, not -- not just that I have these [LAUGH] beliefs --
L:  I --
R:  -- just because somebody on the street told me.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't mean to, like, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, harp on the point, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm [SIGH] -- how -- I -- I mean -- have -- the Bible is a translation from Greek and from Aramaic and how do you know that -- that -- that -- that's what -- that these translations are correct and -- and -- and these prophecies are -- are actually what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is said in the text?
R:  Mhm.  Well --
L:  You know these things?
