L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, my name is Shanese and, um, for the topic, no, I don't think there'll ever be peace in the Middle East.  That would be -- that would be the short story.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's a little bit too much unrest, a whole lot or religious issues, everybody thinks they're right.  There'll never be peace.
R:  [MN] Right.  I -- I -- I agree with that.  Um, my name's Heather and I live in, ah, Florida.  I don't know --
L:  Wh- -- you live where?  Florida?
R:  Yeah.  And my husband's actually over in Iraq right now.  He's in the army, so ...
L:  Which branch of the military?
R:  [COUGH] The army.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, my dad was a reservist but he never was active duty, like, around the time of Vietnam.  But, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Nah, nobody -- ah, I don't think anyone in my families active duty right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whereas people have in the past but ...
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Well, it kind of sucks because, um, last August he was supposed to get out and, um, you know, with everything with [COUGH] nine eleven they extended him another year.  And he was actually supposed to get out in, like, two months and they sent him so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  We don't know -- now we don't know when he's coming back, so ... [NOISE]
L:  How long has he been in, like, over- overall?
R:  Um, he just finished up his six years.  He was only, you know, he was signed on for five.  But, you know, they can keep you w- -- however long they want I guess, but [COUGH] the tr-
L:  So you're anxiously waiting for him to get back?
R:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] And, ah, Friday was my birthday and he ended up, um, you know -- we can't be together obviously but he sent -- he had a friend of ours send me flowers so it was really sweet.  But [MN] I just [SIGH] I try not to watch the news as much as I was 'cause it's so depressing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah, it is.  'Cause it's like they're -- they're there and it's definitely -- obviously it's danger but it's like one of those situations, it's like there's always going to be problems there.  It's like, you can't just go over there and straighten out one country and think like, "Okay, that's it, we're done in the Middle East".  It's always going to be something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that's the problem.  I mean, it's like -- it's li- -- you know, I guess, like, you know, like, World War Two was over then okay, that's the end of it.  You know what I mean?  It wasn't another, you know, type going back over the same issues.  But, I mean, that whole -- there's just those religious differences and people who think their land belongs to them.  Or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And they're not really coexisting very well over there, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  I mean --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  It's just like everybody's views are so extremist, I mean, it's just not any room for compromise.  An- an- an- and the people there are willing to die for it, you know?  It's not like, "We kinda see things differently and we'll just agree to disagree".  No, "We'll all agree to kill each other".
R:  Exactly.
L:  Which is pretty much is what's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- happening.  It's terrible.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It really is.  It really is.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Um, [MN] well, it's like, you know, they -- they hate us so much, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's -- and -- and it's kind of hard to understand why but you kind of figure that they've been hearing all this, you know, obviously he was lying about us and saying, "Well, they're gonna do this, this, and this" becau- -- I don't know.  I heard this, um -- one of my, um, friends at work, her dad is like career military so he always knows all this insider stuff --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  And he said that, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess they had found, um, like right after they had found those, um, [LIPSMACK] what would you call 'em?  Those chemical suits.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You remember that being on the news?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Well, I heard from, um, this girl at work that her dad told us that, like, they did a -- they did some kind of news announcement or something, like, right [NOISE] after the whole fighting began.  And they said that everybody needed these suits because the Americans were going to start using chemical weapons.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And I guess the reason behind that was that they were going to start using it and blaming it on us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for al- -- you know, all the people that would have gotten killed.  They would have been like, "Oh, those bastards" you know.  So, [LIPSMACK] I was like, "Yeah, that's -- that's real f- -- you know, this is a real fair fight here".  But, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, well -- yeah, they have their propaganda.
R:  [MN]
L:  They've got to, you know, spin their -- spin it their way to make it look, you know, the way they want it to look.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Tha- that's the problem.
R:  And I mean -- and, you know, I -- I talk to people all the time about it because I kind of feel like, you know, um, yeah, he's a bad guy but I'm not sure we should've sent all of our guys over there, you know.  And people are -- [NOISE] I mean, I don't -- can't remember how many people -- like, I mean, over a hundred guys have died already and it's like it just -- it's not been that long, you know?
L:  I know.
R:  And I'm just like -- it's pretty selfish but I'm always like, [SIGH] you know, "Thank God that's not my husband" but, you know, that's selfish but, you know, I guess you've kind of got to be like that.  But [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I grew up with a father who was, you know, a police officer so I was -- you know, I mean, that's -- that how it is, you know.  I mean, course --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- somebody has to die just not anyone related to me.  Um, [LAUGH] I mean, and --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- that's how you feel, I mean, definitely.
R:  Yeah.  And I was so happy when they found the -- the POWs. [MN]
L:  I know, that was great.
R:  Especially the o- -- the -- the, um, [LIPSMACK] one lady, um, the --
L:  With the kids?
R:  The black girl.
L:  In Texas?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and -- 'cause, I mean, 'cause I'm a mom and she's a mom and I'm like, "Oh my God, thank God they found h- -- you know, thank God they found all of 'em but --"
L:  I know.
R:  And then you think about there's, I think they said like six other people that they don't know where they are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And it's just like -- I mean, I can't even imagine if, you know, that was some -- you know, one of your family members, you know?  "Oh my God, what's happening to them?" you know.  But [SIGH] I mean, I can- -- [LAUGH] I don't know if I'd be able to, you know, even if it was, you know, they came back after two weeks or something.  I don't know if I [NOISE] could handle it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd be like, "Oh my God, what's going on?" and -- [MN]
L:  I -- it's one of those situations you can't imagine yourself in.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, like, if it ever happened to me, like, okay, I have to deal with it, I don't really have any choice [LAUGH] like, that -- just li- -- ah, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's here and I have to deal with it.  But ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's rough, I mean, it's definitely --
R:  And, I mean --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  And now they're talking about -- now they're talking about, you know, +possibility -- possibility of going to war with Syria and they've got all this crap going on in North Korea.  And it's like, "Oh my God, is my husband ever coming home?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's like, and he's just gets it, "That's it, you're not going back any more after this.  That's it".
R:  Oh my God.  Yeah, I me- [LAUGH] Like --
L:  Like, get a --
R:  They better --
L:  -- civilian job, ha-ha.
R:  They better cut him loose.  Because it's like we were -- we were trying to think of, you know, 'cause he was all getting worried like, um, 'cause he -- he didn't leave that long ago probably about [MN] a couple of weeks ago.  And, you know, he was talking about, "Well, I'm going to come back down to Florida" 'cause he was stationed at -- in Washington DC.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, you know, he was talking about, "Oh, I'm gonna get a security job down there" and everything.  Then [MN] ah, see you later. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  "Got to run".
R:  And I was like, "Oh my God, [LAUGH] what am I gonna do?" [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] But it's -- it's hard for our son.  He's only three, you know, and he doesn't understand, you know, where daddy is.  He just -- each time you ask him he just says, "Daddy's at work" you know.  So ...
L:  He's like, "Doesn't he ever get off of work?  He's always at work".  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And they used to -- and they used to, um -- you know, he saw him, mm, let's see, in January for his birthday and, you know, they started to get really bonded again, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They hadn't seen each other in a few months and it's -- it's like and then they talk on the phone every so often.  And then now, you know -- you know, he's like, "Where's daddy?"  And I'm like -- and it breaks my heart 'cause I'm like, "I don't know" [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah.  Can he do, like, emails?  Are they able to do that or ...?
R:  Yeah, every so of- -- you know, I think pretty much things have calmed down there and he's in Military Police so, I mean, it's not like he's, you know, right out there.  But, you know, he's still [MN] [NOISE] in the midst but ...  What?  [NOISE] But, you know, he kn- -- he knows that daddy's a cop and he knows daddy's a policeman.  But, you know.  And he's like, "I don't know where my daddy is" you know.  I feel so bad for him.
L:  I know.
R:  You know?
L:  That must be so hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That must be the worse.  To be like, "I don't know either".  [LAUGH] "We don't know".
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But he'll be back soon.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, now I'm not allowed in the living room.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I said now I'm -- he won't let me go back in my room. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  No, you have to stay in there.  But, you know, I think -- I think that's probably right.  They're probably, you know -- their state -- they believe so many different things there and, you know, they -- I just don't think -- you know, even if Iraq is, you know, rebuilt and done all this stuff they want to do, then I really don't think everything -- everywhere else isn't going to be different, you know.
L:  I mean, their views are just so extreme over there.  They don't have, like, gray areas like United States.  It's just like all or nothing, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the -- thei- their views are just so extreme.
R:  Either they, you know, love you or they just hate your guts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I mean --
R:  And, um --
L:  -- the Middle East is just such a mess.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'd be afraid.  I mean, like to visit or something?  Like, forget about it.  Like, going to, like, through the Holy Land and all that type of stuff, forget about it.  It's too dangerous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  I mean, people have no problem with suicide bombing, you know, taking, [LAUGH] you know , "We're willing to die for our religious beliefs".  And they do, like, all the time, like, at the drop of a hat.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's continual.  It's not like one or two people do it.  It's like the big honor to do that.  So ...
R:  And I also heard that Saddam Hussein, right after the -- you know they were doing all those, um, suicide bombings in, I guess, in, you know, Israel?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I heard [NOISE] that he [inaudible] like, the families of the bombers, he was giving them, like -- like oodles of money.
L:  Yeah, I mean, 'cause they're like --
R:  I mean, just paying them off.
L:  You're like a hero, I mean, to be related to one of those people.
R:  Oh God.
L:  I mean --
R:  Oh my God.
L:  -- it's like you're like a -- like a celebrity.
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  You know, 'cause you see the people and they'll be carrying their kid's picture around and, you know, they're like -- that's like the -- the biggest, like, deal.  It's like the ultimate sacrifice and you're like the -- a super huge hero if you do that.  I mean --
R:  Isn't that amazing?  I mean, to do something like that?  It's like, "Oh my God" you know?  I don't know even if I believed in something so strongly I don't -- I know I wouldn't do that.
L:  I know.
R:  You know?
L:  It's just I guess it's the whole culture that they were like, you know, brought up to think
