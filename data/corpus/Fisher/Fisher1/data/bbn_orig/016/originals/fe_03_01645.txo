L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi there, my name is Bill.
R:  My name's Shirley.
L:  Okay.  Um, I'm -- I'm in New York.
R:  I- I'm in Indianapolis.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE] Um, well this is a lot more interesting than the topic that I had the first time.  I think the first time -- I don't even remember what it was it was much bo- -- much more boring.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, mine was too.  I don't remember either what mine was so it --
L:  Well, they emailed last week and they said [NOISE] that -- that they had all these categories and I said, "Gee, that doesn't sound at all like what I did the last time" so ...  I'm using my speaker phone because I figure it'd be more interesting for these folks, you know, to get the responses to get --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for getting the voice.  I could have picked up the phone but I assume it sounds okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it sounds fine, sure.
L:  So, I don't know, so what should we talk about?  Um, I guess S- Saddam's gone.
R:  Yes.
L:  Although I -- I read something today that said that he -- they think he's still alive actually and [NOISE] -- and --
R:  Oh, I -- I think he is too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I, ah, he's gonna be, um, a hard one to ever get.
L:  Well, maybe -- maybe we can get him and Bin -- Bin Laden at the same time.
R:  Oh, goodness, wouldn't that be great?  I mean, that would just, um, [LIPSMACK] really take care of a big situation if, ah, if something like that were to happen. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  [NOISE] So, I don't know, what should we talk about?  Should we talk about, um, will there ever be peace in the Middle East?  So, I guess I'd say, um, um, be- being a New York Jew I guess I would say, um, no, not unless they blow away all the Palestinians.
R:  Well, that's just about it.  I- I'm not sure, you know, if there ever will be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  Ah, I just -- I'm -- I'm not sure.  [MN] I wish.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, I think that the problem is that, you know, the Palestinians have been offered, you know, good deals in the past that they've turned down.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, because -- ah, it has been s- such a rough life for them I don't think they know anything different, you know.  It's just [MN] that's how they've been brought up and I- I'm not sure if things will -- will change very much.
L:  No, what they -- they seem to [NOISE] want something that -- that's -- I mean, their leaders --
R:  Right.
L:  -- insisting on getting [NOISE] something that is probably not best for them and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- leaders would just sort of step aside.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's true, yeah.
L:  Whole Arafat thing, you know, if the -- you know, if -- if the leaders would just -- if they had different leadership in there who maybe were willing to look at it and say, "Hey, you know, this is a pretty good deal, you know, and we won't get blown up all the time and, ah --"
R:  Right, yeah.  I -- I know.  But, you know, um, I think after we get out of there things will go right back pretty well like they were.  I- I'm -- it's just according to who gets in there and -- and, ah, in their leadership and -- and takes over.
L:  Oh, I think, you know, maybe -- you know, maybe people will be less willing to, you know, blow themselves up now that -- now that they don't have, ah --
R:  Right, that's just --
L:  -- to -- to pay them, you know, to pay their family for doing it.  But I -- I'm sure that somebody else will step up and, ah, you know, carry on the trust fund and stuff like that so ...
R:  Right, I'm sure, yeah.  It's just a shame that -- that they're brought up like that and had a lead- leadership that -- that taught them that they had to do these things, you know, in order to survive.  And i- it's just sad. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yep.  Um, [NOISE] one second here.
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] I'm telling my daughter how to burn a CD.  Um, let's see, so what else l- -- um, I think that, um -- [MN] and the interesting thing of course is that the US having gone in after old -- after, you know, Bin Laden and now after Hussein.  I think that, you know, it sort of gives the Israelis credibility in terms of whatever they want to do.
R:  Right, yes.
L:  Because they can't -- they can no longer turn to them and say, you know, "This is bad, don't -- don't do this".
R:  Right, yeah, I know.  Yeah.
L:  I had that read that -- I- I've heard that proportionally if you take, you know, the number of Israelis killed by the suicide bombers as opposed -- you know, compared to the full population, it -- it would be much higher than anything, you know, that was ever -- you know, that were -- you know, that happened on September eleventh.
R:  Right.  I'm just --
L:  It's, like, a high percentage.
R:  Right.  I just hate that -- that we did lose some of our -- our boys over there.  And at least we got the POWs back that -- that they had.  Which, God, I just didn't really think that we would.  I really, really didn't think we would.
L:  Yup.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I was so scared for 'em.
L:  Yeah, that -- that was kind of strange that --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- they all -- that they found them, um --
R:  I was terrified.
L:  But m- maybe there's still hope, right?  You know, for [NOISE] -- for --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- ah, for some of the people in -- in -- in Iraq.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  And of course now they're not happy with the US being there so --
R:  No, no, not at all.  Not at all, hm hm, no, they don't like that.  So [SIGH] I'm just hoping that --
L:  The good news is that they claim that Syria says that they're [NOISE] seeing, you know, that they're going to, ah, stop screwing around.
R:  Right, yeah.  I just [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] oh, yeah.
L:  What else shall we talk about?  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I -- it's good, you know, they said they'll come on and tell us when our ten minutes is up.  Now, before they never --
L:  Well, I've been on -- I have a -- I have a timer on my phone here at work so I've been on for six minutes and twenty seconds, of which probably a minute, so probably we figure we've got about five minutes or so.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, on the conversation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what else shall be talk about?  Um --
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  Ah, let's see, well, let's see.  I don't -- I -- I wonder if they'll ever get rid of Arafat.  I guess since we should go back to talking about the topic at hand, right?  I guess we don't have to, I mean --
R:  No, I don't think so.  As long as it's on, you know, ah, with --
L:  [inaudible] right?
R:  -- what had to do with Iraq and stuff over there so, um --
L:  Your second call for them?
R:  Huh?
L:  This is your second call on this system?
R:  Yeah, mhm, yeah.  So is this your second one or have you had more?
L:  Uh, this is my second call also.  So it's interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had one a couple of months ago and I just go paid last week, the week before and then I got the --
R:  Oh, well see, I've never even got paid yet.  But --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, I seen on there where they said some of 'em was getting paid and stuff and --
L:  Did you --
R:  So --
L:  When did you sign up?  Recently or ...?
R:  Ah, no, it's been a while.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  Yeah, it was a good little while.  So, it was a good little while before you ever got paid too, right?
L:  Yes, yes, a couple of months or so.
R:  Yeah, see, that's the way with me too, so --
L:  But, I mean, ten bucks, you can't argue with it.  I wonder -- I wonder if it's our tax dollars at work, you know, that's paying --
R:  Right.
L:  Got to figure that somebody is.
R:  That's right, it --
L:  Has to be.  So it's got to be a grant from somewhere.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I actually, ah -- I actually run a mailing list with a few hundred people on it so I sent out the r- -- link last week and I said, you know, "Why don't you sign up and, you know, and put my name down, put my number down as the referral code".  Well, we'll see if I get any money out of it.
R:  Right, yeah.  That's right, because there is.  They -- they pa-
L:  Lists where people are supposed to post great deals and, you know, good, you know, deals on line.  And we haven't really had any.  It's -- it's been sort of weak, you know, on the list.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And plus I had told people that they couldn't post things with referral codes in them.  And then all of a sudden, you know, I'm posting this, so I felt a little guilty.  But nobody complained which probably means that nobody reads it anymore.
R:  Yeah.  Do you get on, ah, the computer --
L:  If somebody read it maybe I'll get ten bucks out of it.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Do you get on the computer and do any surveys on there?
L:  Sure.
R:  Oh, I do too, yeah.  Lots of 'em.  I spent -- that's what I'm doing on there.  I do on there -- any way to -- you got to make a dollar now to --
L:  Might as well, right?
R:  [LAUGH] You aint a kidding.
L:  Where do you make your -- where do you make your money on- on- -- ah, online?  Do you go to Greenfield, I guess, and, ah --
R:  Oh, I do that, yeah.  I do that.  Do you do Savvy?
L:  Yeah, I think so, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I do that one and I do, ah, Consumers' Corner and I do, ah, the contractor surveys and, ah, all the executive, ah, advisory boards and --
L:  Oh.
R:  I do, ah, everything that I --
L:  I- is there a site that has the links to all of these places?  You know the problem with some of them are --
R:  Yeah, if you go on -- have you ever been on that Big, Big Savings, ah, dotcom?
L:  No, but I'll go look.
R:  [MN] Okay.  And, um -- and it's a -- um, it has a freebies site on there that then a lot of -- most of the time they'll, ah, put a big list of all the, ah, survey sites.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE] So -- so have you ever won any big bucks on these things?  I mean, other than the five bucks or so?
R:  I've got pretty good dollars off of, ah, some of those, ah, surveys, yeah.
L:  We-
R:  Some of 'em you can make up to three hundred dollars off each survey.
L:  Really?  Wh- -- I -- do you actually tell the truth?
R:  Ah, well, we won't say [LAUGH] if we do that.  I think it's just --
L:  This is really very kind of depressing because, you know, these companies are paying big bucks for these things.
R:  I know they are, honestly they are.
L:  And the result of -- of -- you know, nothing personal, I mean, I have lied on a couple of surveys too, you know, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the- the- they're getting bogus -- they're getting bogus information.  Right, yeah.
R:  Most of the time I do a lot of the -- like for the, ah, Proctor and Gamble and your shampoo and all that.  Now, you can just about tell the truth because y- y- you know, you -- you use the product so ...
L:  Wh- where are the Proctor and Gamble sa- -- surveys?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  On their site or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And do they -- and they pay?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  Mhm.  And then they'll send you products to try also and then pay you for doing 'em.
L:  That?  What was that?  What was the second one you said?
R:  [NOISE] Pardon?
L:  What was the one after Proctor and Gamble?
R:  Ah, I do -- I, ah -- well, let's see, I don't [NOISE] know whether I said anything after Proctor and Gamble because there is -- I probably got, ah, forty or fifty survey sites that I go to to do surveys.
L:  Oh, okay.  So Big, Big Savings dotcom --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has the links to 'em?
R:  Yeah.  If you go, there, ah, on their forum --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- ah, there's all kind of surveys that you can get there.
L:  Are you signed up at Pinecone?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Pinecone Research?
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  They're -- they're pretty good.  They -- they send you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the [inaudible].
R:  H- have you got on there?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, they'll -- I -- I do theirs too.  Yeah, I do that.  They send products out too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to try.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] I haven't gotten anything from them I --
R:  Haven't you?  Oh, yeah, I did, ah, you know, like new products is coming up and stuff.  I've done a lot of their Pepsi and peanuts and all things like that.  Deodorant, everything, you know, all of new things that's coming out they'll --
L:  I -- I've gotten a few small surveys
