L:  Hello --
R:  Hello.
L:  -- call partner. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, my name is Wanda.
R:  Hi, Wanda.  My name's Debbie.
L:  Hello.  Where are you at?
R:  California.
L:  Really, I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, my gosh, it's late for you. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's eleven o'clock. [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I told 'em I was available until midnight.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, today we're talking about airline security, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Do you fly a lot?
L:  No, not as much as I'd like to, but [SIGH], I don't know, I've -- I've flown a few times in the last couple of years and, I don't know, I don't find the security all that tight anyway.
R:  Now, I ac- -- I fly almost every month.
L:  Oh, lucky you.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and right after nine eleven in October, um, I actually flew to Mexico --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was, you know, like two weeks after --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- two weeks later --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- the first week of October.
L:  -- the end of September -- two weeks later, I flew to Canada. [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- I thought the security in Mexico was better than ours, um ... and I was really surprised at that point how -- how lax it was, and then when we got to Mexico coming home, they opened our suitcases that were being checked in before we even checked 'em in and went through every piece --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- of whatever in your suitcase --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything before you could even check it in and they weren't doing that here at all, um --
L:  No.
R:  They inspected every inch of your purse -- everything, um --
R:  Gee.
L:  They took it all out and -- and I, as much as I fly, never see anything like that here.
R:  No.  I -- I don't know, you know, I think that if -- if terrorists really want to get at us through the airports I -- I don't think it's gonna be that difficult.  So, [SIGH] I don't know, you know.  I don't want it to be so incredibly tight that it's, you know, awkward to fly, but still it would be nice to feel kind of secure. [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's getting a little bit better now, um, they've got their routine down.  When they first started having heightened security the lines at the airport were so ridiculous. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  They would wrap around the ribbons and go down the corridor [SIGH] to the, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- exit of the airport and it just took so long to get through it, um ...  I was lucky 'cause I was in a wheelchair last year, so I got to bypass all that [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was the only -- it was the only good thing I had going for me, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm -- I'm not in a wheelchair now.  I had surgery on my spine, so I'm okay now, but, um -- but I just would look back at those people and think, "Oh, my gosh" [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, n- now when I go to the airports the lines aren't that long and they move pretty quickly.
R:  Right.  Now you're just stuck with all those extra hours of being trapped on the other side of the gate and nothing to do.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] Arrive two hours early, and then what? [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  I -- I think that, um, they say that, but -- since I fly so much I know, depending on what hour I'm flying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I really don't have to.  You know, if I'm leaving at eleven o'clock in the morning and it's not that busy at the airport because the business travellers are gone, I can get there an hour, forty five minutes even, and not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and have plenty of time.  There's --
R:  Yeah, everybody else has gone through already.
L:  --  no reason to get there two hours early.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I don't know.  I wish everything could go back to the way it used to be [LAUGH] when it was easy and we didn't have to worry about anything.
R:  I just think it's really ridiculous when they're pulling people out of line for the, um, extra inspections that don't fit profiles of terrorists.
L:  Right, yeah.  My sister gets pulled out every single time.  She is -- she's in her thirties, she's a white American woman, but every single time they manage to pull her out and go through her stuff and check her and it's like, I don't get it, you know, but I think they're --
R:  I never have and -- and you really -- you have to stereotype in this situation and profile because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- terrorists all look a certain way, usually.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's always wacko -- wacko caucasian people, but right now the people that are causing terrorism are from a certain group.
L:  Right, yeah, but I think they're try- --
R:  They're -- they're males -- they're males eighteen to thirty five, you know, they're -- and they really have to profile because that's who the terrorists are.
L:  Right, yeah, but they're trying so hard to show that they're fair.
R:  Not eighty year old caucasian women. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  And when you see a little grandma being pulled out of line it's just so ridiculous because --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they're not always thinking so clearly.  Although, now I was at --
R:  Well, they're trying to be politically correct, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- in this situation you can't be politically correct and worry about people's feelings. [SIGH]
L:  Right.  I was really surprised -- I was at the airport last week 'cause I was doing some shopping at the airport and, um, a s- -- a person from the -- the company that -- that does all the -- that runs all of the stores and stuff, had to take me through security and stay with my while I was in all of the areas, but he just -- you know, he had me following behind him, we'd walk up to the security thing, he'd show his badge and say, "She's with me", and we'd walk on through and, you know, he stayed with me -- he had to, but had he not been, you know, a reliable person, any employee could walk someone else through the gate and just leave 'em over there.  So, you know, [SIGH] I don't know.  There's just lots of other ways to get into trouble there.
R:  Yeah, that's kinda scary, um, 'cause they could, you know, if they were getting paid off by a terrorist [LAUGH] to get 'em in --
L:  Yeah, yeah, you know, and --and we went -- we went past the security because it was icky outside.  He said when the weather is nice he doesn't even bother, he goes outside and then goes around the outside of the airport so that he doesn't have to bother with the security people at all.  And it's like, [SIGH] it would be so easy to be trailing somebody through there, you know, and -- and [SIGH], I don't know, it just, I don't know.  If they're asking us whether or not we think that terrorists could still cause trouble -- yeah, I do [LAUGH].  I -- I just -- it looked to me like it would be too easy for somebody to get in there.  But --
R:  And I'm flying again next week. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you'll be fine.  It just --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- doesn't it seem to you though that there have to be people out there still who support Saddam and wanna get even with us now for causing trouble?
R:  Oh, I'm sure there's wackos.
L:  You know, I mean, they were mad at us before.  There -- there have to be a few people still working on their own.
R:  But -- but our borders need to be tightened so they don't get in -- they're already here --
L:  I know.
R:  So, it's too late, but they're -- they let everybody in the borders.  It doesn't matter, you know, what country they're coming from.  They need to tighten the borders because, you know, in California our -- our State is just upside down as far as the deficit and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of it is because of illegal immigration into California --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and our taxes have to pay for services for these people.  And it's -- it's lots of different ethnic groups.  It's just not one in particular.  You know, there's a majority that have immigrated here illegally, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they need to tighten our borders for security reasons as well as --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the economy.
L:  Well we -- yeah, we have the problem with 'em too and you get the illegal immigrants, or even just people emigrating here from other countries, legally.  They not only come into the country but then they start insisting that all of the public services be available to them in their languages and -- and we bend over backwards to help absolutely everybody.  It's like, "Why in the world am I paying, you know, for you to be able to have everything done in your language and I didn't ask you to come here?" [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, but if they -- if they stop that, if they just shut down the borders and didn't let 'em in, we could monitor the tourists [LAUGH] more.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- but they could sneak in through Mexico because the borders aren't very tight and -- or sneak in from Canada and they're here, and once they're here we can't --
L:  I know.
R:  -- monitor their movements.
L:  No.  I don't --
R:  If they come through legally and they have visas or green cards, or whatever, it's easier to monitor their activity.
L:  Right.  And it's gonna -- it's gonna be harder for them to get cards and stuff now to come in legally --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause there's -- there's no government for them to apply for them any more.  I don't know.  I just -- I get really frustrated sometimes with our -- our open door policy, you know, it's just like a- let every- -- absolutely everybody in and we'll deal with it, you know, you've too many people and no control and -- and you always feel like the government knows more about what's going on than we do and that even though we're not aware of it, they're taking care of us.  Well, kinda it was proven that they're not.  That they don't know what's going on and they're not out there stopping problems.
R:  It's -- it's -- it's very frustrating being a citizen and -- and not having services available for you when you need 'em --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but somebody who comes in illegally gets more benefits from the government than we do.
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, and even, you know, when I was out doing those shops at the airport it was like, counter after counter, "Is there anybody here ...
