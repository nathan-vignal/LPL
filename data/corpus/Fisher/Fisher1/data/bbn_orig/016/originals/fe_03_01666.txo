L:  Laurie.
R:  Hi, my name's Janet.  I'm from Mid West.
L:  Hi, I'm from Fort Meyers, Florida.
R:  Oh.  Okay, well, this is almost a scary topic.
L:  Yeah, it is.  H- have you done this before?
R:  Ah, yeah, this is my third time.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, it's -- is this y- -- how many times have you done it?
L:  I just did it once and that was about a month ago.
R:  I did it about a month ago and then I didn't hear any more from 'em and I got an email a couple of days ago.
L:  Me too.
R:  And then I got a call, I believe Friday.  And then I got one today.  Like wow.
L:  Oh, well, yeah.  I think I got a call Friday.  Or, well, I'm not sure if it was Friday or not.  But I had the computer on and therefore I missed the call.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, huh.
R:  But, no, I don't think we'll ever has peace in the Middle East.
L:  Mm, I don't it.  I --
R:  I think we should get out.  I don't th- -- well, I- I'm against us having been there so ...
L:  Are you?  Well, I kind of think that we needed to do something because if we don't do anything we look like we're gonna be walked ov- all over and so we had to do something.  But ...
R:  We gave him the -- we helped set him up and the thing that I find very upsetting is we saved the Ministry of Oil --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But we let people -- we let people loot the, ah, Baghdad Museum and around --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Babylonia.
L:  Oh.
R:  And [NOISE] so, I mean, I -- I -- but I'm not in favor of the pr- -- ah, the current person in the White House so it's like --
L:  Oh, you're not in favor of Bush?
R:  I heard that and I thought, "Oh, man, I -- should I reject the call or not?"
L:  Oh.
R:  No, and you're in Florida too, I mean, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that probably -- I mean, that thing they did with the election I think is really --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  In fact my husband had a f- we nea- -- we had n- not an argument but we were exchanging words over Donald Rumsfeld.  When he came home from work this evening he was on the news.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's like I -- I don't expect there to be a Presidential election in two thousand and four.  If it looks like Bush is gonna lose he's going to suspend the elections.  And that Patriot Act, ah, is horrible.  I can't believe the Senate did that and people just don't realize what we've given up.  They're trying to m- wrap it around, um, the flag and, you know, that you have to support the President or you're not patriotic.  And it's like, that's never been -- the President has never been the symbol of patriotism in our country.  And I just -- I find this astounding and I hope that -- hope that I'm wrong but, ah, [MN] you know.  I think we're gonna go into Syria or Iran next.
L:  Yeah.  We -- I'm -- that's --
R:  We want that oil.  And, I mean, they -- they lied.  They had to -- I mean, it's all proven when they -- when they saved the oil ministry.  Not one thing got hurt in that place.
L:  Hm.
R:  But, um, they let them loot the Baghdad Museum of priceless artifacts, of the, um, hist- -- where the world as we know it, where our civilization began seven, eight thousand years ago.
L:  Oh, really.  Ah, see I don't -- I don't even -- I'm not following it that well.
R:  Oh.
L:  I have two small children so I didn't even know about that.
R:  Well, see, that's my problem.  I [LAUGH] -- I cho- -- I actually broke my war porn habit a couple of --
L:  Your what?
R:  We call it war porn.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't where I heard that from.  It's like, you know, the twenty four hours it's always on.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I broke that a couple of weeks ago when I went to a retreat for the weekend and, um, I vo- -- but I still read a lot online about it.  I need to stop.
L:  Oh, do ya?
R:  I need to stop rea- reading the British papers.  They just upset me.
L:  Well, I was watching it pretty closely, you know, when it f- the war first started.  But then, you know, I just got busy and I just didn't feel like watching it every day.  But I know there are people out there like you who just are glued to it and, you know, internet or --
R:  I was, yeah.
L:  Or the t- the news.  And, you know, people can't think unless they know what's going on and stuff.  But since I've got distractions, two of 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got one, but I still -- I still get caught up in it [NOISE] and ...
L:  Oh, how old's your one?
R:  Ah, five and a half.
L:  Oh, really?  Hm.
R:  How old's yours?
L:  Mine's four.
R:  Four?
L:  He's four, he'll be five in August, and the other one's nine.
R:  Really?  My birthd- my daughter's birthday's in August, it's August ninth.
L:  Oh, hers is the seventh.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  [inaudible].
L:  She in kindergarten?
R:  Ah, yeah, she'll be in first grade -- well, she's actually doing some first grade work.  We home school her.
L:  Oh, do ya?
R:  And, um, but she's bas- basically kindergarten.  I don't want her to get too far ahead.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've heard of people that will let their kids, I guess, work year round and keep going ahead so they can graduate from high school when they're nine.  And it's, like, no, I don't want that.
L:  No.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think that --
L:  There's a lot of people home schooling nowadays I guess.
R:  Yeah, it's like a --
L:  I've met so many of 'em
R:  Well, it's amazing.  Ah, when I first started looking at this online back in, like ninety eight --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I was kind of saying, "Oh, this is kinda cool" and like what do -- but I'm thinking, "Oh, I couldn't do it".  And when you see how many people are doing it and how many resources there are for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, wow.
L:  Well, I go to garage sales a lot and I find a lot of home school books and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and I bring 'em home and show 'em to my kids and then they get bored with 'em so I'll sell 'em on eBay. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I was gonna say.  There's, ah, there's a couple of Yahoo groups that have home school, um, that are +feeless.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, where you don't have to pay the eBay fee.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And, um, oh, what's the name of the one?  Um, I've bought, like, some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stuff on there and, ah, you can buy and sell and, ah, then you don't have the eBay, ah --
L:  The fee and --
R:  -- markup.  Yeah, it's -- if you go to -- are you familiar with Yahoo groups?
L:  Um, I -- I was on one of their groups a while back.
R:  If you look up groups dot Yahoo dot com --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And get to the homepage of the groups and put in home school fleamail, F.L.E.A.M.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, F.L.E.A.M.A.I.L.  There's, like, ah [NOISE] groups and they're broken down from miscellaneous, first, you know, ah, primary school, um, high school, middle school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, I mean, there's a lot of people that do that now instead of eBay because they don't have to worry about the fee.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  And --
L:  -- eBay charges thirty cents to list and then they get five percent of the listing and -- or what you sell, I mean, and ...
R:  And this way there's also, like, bad trader lists.  If you join -- if you look at the list you'll find it where there's a few people that, you know, have to be -- ah, they either say they're selling something they don't have --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Or they, um, don't e- don't ever buy.  And what happens is if people do th- do bad, they get -- we have our own eBay feedback system sort of.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, where people get their name and email gets posted and --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  So that can be a good deal because there's so many people that -- if you find it at yard sales, ah, so many people want it and --
L:  Oh, that's true.  What -- what, um, books do you use?
R:  Ah, I'm using Saxon Math.
L:  Ah, I just sold a Saxon Math book.
R:  Really?  I've got k- I got k- kindergarten and I've got to get the first grade one, she's ready to go into that.  But my mom and I are going to a home school, um, confere- or exhibition tomorrow.  It's the first time I've ever been to one.
L:  Oh.
R:  We're going tomorrow night or Wednesday, we haven't decided yet.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they're gonna have all the -- they've got, like, thirty five textbook vendors.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And so I said, "Well" I said, "Either that or there is a lady I know from eBay that's wh-" actually I think got the Saxon Math off eBay, I take it back.  Because she's a distributor for them.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  And -- and she sells brand new but a -- a -- a third off retail.
L:  Oh, gosh, well, that's good.
R:  Yeah, so I thought, well, I could just do that.  And I said I -- you know, phonics, I've pretty well got a phonics program, um, online and working with her.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  I don't know if I really want to invest in a phonics program.
L:  Yeah, that Hooked on Phonics is kind of expensive I hear.
R:  I heard it's good though.  I wouldn't -- I mean, yeah, I've been holding back.  I don't know if I want to pay three hundred bucks if I could find it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- used.
L:  That much, huh?
R:  It's -- yeah, it's three hundred brand new --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- the version they're selling today.  If I could find one -- I've bid a few times on eBay and I've always gotten bid out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I d- I don't really think I need it.  I've got these, ah, reading rods.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  The phonics program I bought and different other work books.  And so far she's doing well.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  And, um --
L:  My daughter does, ah -- my -- the older one, she's in a -- she has a Saxon book at her school too so they must be pretty popular.
R:  Well, that's what I've heard.  And I -- I like the math.  Um, they don't really have a workbook, per se.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They kind of [NOISE] have to write and they do different things where -- and I -- and i- it's kind of nice in a way.  I mean, she likes workbooks but at the same time I think some people can get too caught up in workbooks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This way the child has to write.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, think and, um -- or they do a lot -- in the little grades they do a lot of, um, manipulatives and stuff [NOISE] that, ah --
L:  I see.
R:  -- keep 'em busy.
L:  I had thought about doing that but I don't think I have the patience, I don't know. [MN]
R:  Yeah, y- you'd be amazed.  I mean, it's s- -- I think it's good.
L:  I -- well, I think it's a good idea, I really do.
R:  And I have more than I ever thought I'd have, so ...
L:  Do you just have one child?
R:  Yeah.  And I have more -- and she's a pistol.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She's everything -- she's me in spades and my husband in spades and it's like, "Oh, boy".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm like I know if I had her in school they'd be saying, "Mrs. Schmitt, you need to put your daughter on Ritalin".
L:  Oh, they do that so much with kids.
R:  That's my biggest -- that's my biggest reason.  My stepson, um, I'm convinced that that was unnecessary in his behalf.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where I don't -- I th- I don't think it's right where a teacher with a four year degree --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in education should be the one saying, "Put your kid on Ritalin".
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  And, um, they do that because they've got too many kids and they, um, they want 'em to be real quiet.  And, ah, she's -- I don't think she's hyperactive.  I think she's a normal full spirited kid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I don't wanna discourage that.  And that's one [NOISE] thing with home school, you can tailor it to them.
L:  Well, that's true, yeah.
R:  And I've -- a- a lot of people say that about the patience but I -- I've found I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- far more than I ever dreamed.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, check out Yahoo groups, there's a whole bunch of home school lists.  I know there's a big one for Florida --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- because some of the Florida ladies are on other groups I'm on.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, like, there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one called Kindergarten at Home.
L:  Kindergarten at Home?
R:  Uh-huh.  And this lady, ah, that runs it, she runs a bunch of lists for, like, first grade at home, second grade and so forth.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you will get so much great advice and just ideas to test it out and se- you know, even practice a little bit and see if you're -- you know, if you like it.
L:  Hm.
R:  And, ah, there's so many options, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I -- I just -- I just don't w- -- and it's s- secondly I like having her home.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Ah, she's only going to be little for so long and --
L:  I know, they grow up so fast and, like you said about the Ritalin.  I -- I think at my daughter's school a half of the children are on th- Ritalin, so I've heard.
