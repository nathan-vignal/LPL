R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Pam.
R:  Who?
L:  Pam.
R:  Pam?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm Bev -- I'm Bev --
L:  Hi, Bev.
R:  -- from Iowa.
L:  Glad to meet ya.  I'm from Illinois.
R:  Illinois?  Oh, that's not too far away.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the topic.  What do ya think about it?
R:  Well, [SIGH] I guess like if you go to foreign countries they say that -- that -- that's just a common thing -- that people are around there, you know, and the security is very, very high.  So, I don't know, I guess we're used to being at -- being low, I don't know.  We don't travel that much by airplane, but we did go to Boise for the Iowa State football game and of course got caught up in, oh, two or three different times[?] and it was right over the new year too, so the -- the rules had changed.  So, we got -- oh, we got -- oh, we had to go over and they, uh, run our luggage through another thing and then, uh, before we got on the plane we were taken off to the side -- practically everybody was on that plane, and then when we went back they even [COUGH] -- they even went through our stuff.  So, I don't know, you know, I -- I think it probably would catch some, but I don't know if it'd catch all of it.  What do you think?
L:  Well, I went to Tennessee not long ago and [LAUGH] the airports were totally different in what they looked for.  It was weird.  I, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- went in the first one and I didn't realise I had a butane lighter in my purse --
R:  Oh.
L:  Okay?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and I got right through.  I mean, they searched my purse, they searched me, I had to take my shoes off, they felt my seat, under my socks, everything -- in Chicago.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then, I'm coming back -- in Tennessee airport, all of a sudden I'm surrounded by like six guards.
R:  Really?
L:  "Ma'am will you come over here please?"  You know, and it's like, "What'd I do?  What'd I do? --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- You know, and it was a butane lighter [LAUGH].  
R:  Oh.
L:  They confiscated it and everything.  So, then they take me over to the private area to do a search and she doesn't even have me take my shoes off.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know, and they -- they even buzzed because they had metal in 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, that could've been a knife.  That could've been a gun --
R:  Could've been something.
L:  -- that could've been anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I walked right through it.  Now, that doesn't make sense to me.
R:  Yeah, I don't think there's any organized method of what -- what's happening.  You know, I think that they all have to have the same -- sort of the same kind of rules or whatever or -- or it probably isn't going to be as successful as it could be.
L:  Mhm.  But I think it's important that we have the security with --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- all the hijackings.  I've always thought the security was a little lax.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Ya know.
R:  It just seems like we have to have something tragic happen for us to be shaken up a little bit and, you know, change things some.
L:  Yeah, and it's sad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's really sad, but at least I do feel a little bit safer.  But then my girlfriend, um, wasn't even thinking and -- and she bought a sword for her son.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They got it through the airport with it.
R:  She did?
L:  In her -- yeah, in her luggage.
R:  Oh.
L:  It was a sword inside of a case and it was a fancy sword like that you would get like over in India or something, ya know.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  And went right through and she got home and she goes, "I forgot all about that".
R:  Hm.
L:  And she says they never even questioned it.
R:  Well, that seems funny.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They must --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- be looking for -- I don't know, you know, maybe they're looking for certain things that we don't even ... I don't know.  'Cause they searched ours and we didn't -- you know, we got nothing in there.  We had -- well, they messed up the suitcases, you know, [LAUGH] but I mean we had, um -- oh, we had done some shopping.  You know, we had a few stuff but it wasn't anything you know.  I had gotten a nativity scene.  It was a glass or something and they couldn't figure out what that was but they said it was all right.  I said, "Oh it's a ..." you know,  and I told him.  "Oh, okay, that's what that is".  You know, it's like, you know, sort of weird, but --
L:  Well, the way the planes are designed today they can't even get down to the, um, luggage, can they, from inside the plane?
R:  Well, I wouldn't think so.  So, I would think, you know, anything down there should be fine.
L:  Yeah, maybe that's why she got through with a sword.  I don't know.
R:  Although they do -- they do -- you know, they check that stuff too though before they take it in, but --
L:  Uh-huh, [MN] I don't know.  
R:  Mm.
L:  I have no clue. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  So, you --
L:  -- but that -- that was about my only experience and -- and I sit there too and I wonder -- that's just getting on the plane.  How much danger is there right in the airport?  And I think maybe they should have -- I don't like the fact that you can't go to see your people off any more.  Like when I took my grandson and my daughter -- they were going back to Arizona and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to be there an hour or two beforehand --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it would've been nice to have been able to be down there with them until they got on the plane and seen them off and everything.  I miss that.  
R:  Oh, you -- you can't do that any more?
L:  Mm, mm, you can't do that any more.
R:  Hm.
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  As I say we don't -- we don't travel as much by plane that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Every time we go it's gonna be new, it seems like, you know, because ... but --
L:  They wouldn't let me in and like the shops and all that are suffering.  You can't get in there.  But yet the people that are travelling, they go back there and I don't -- well, yeah, I guess you are searched before you get back to that part.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I -- I think maybe it's a little overboard in some areas and then other areas it's probably a little lax.
R:  Right, right.  Just like -- well like going in the sporting events too.  We go to like Iowa State football and, you know, there was supposedly be, you know, more security and this and that but I don't know, you know.  I know you're not supposed to take water in or something, you know, and you stick it in your coat and it goes in, you know.  They don't check it that much, but ... I don't know.  And you know there's booze and stuff in it bec- -- people get that in there 'cause you see the bottles [SIGH] when you go to leave [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And I don't think they have any metal detectors there.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  You know, but ...
L:  Well, do you feel safe flying?
R:  Huh?
L:  Do you feel safe flying now?
R:  Well, yeah, I guess, uh, probably no diff- -- not a whole lot of difference than before.  You know, it's just that it seems to be more -- more of a hassle but I -- that's all right, you know, as long as it's gonna -- if it's gonna be safer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  But I think -- I think they have to iron out some of the bugs and stuff as to, you know, so it doesn't take so long and all that stuff [MN].
L:  Well, while you're waiting around in the airport, I mean, there's still opportunities for terrorists.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, in the airport and I would think, well, if you really had a terrorist gonna attach, um -- sure, so far, they've always attacked a plane, but what's to keep them from attacking the whole airport?
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, and I don't really feel there's enough security that way, um -- yeah, they limit 'em from getting back to where they -- aboard, but there's still a majority of the airport that's open to everybody.
R:  Right, I mean you hear--
L:  I think maybe --
R:  -- isolated incidents of, you know, so and so got through the security with a gun, or it got through, you know, and you're wondering, "Well, how is this happening", [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I have to wonder too how many people that work there, um, aren't involved.  That these people [inaudible] through --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  I mean, it's just like those pilots and that, you know, they had a pilot license and everything and, you know, got on those planes and nobody knew any different.
L:  And how well are they checked --
R:  Right --
L:  -- by their coworkers? 
R:  -- right.  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  Mm.
L:  I think maybe they should have something -- just anybody who enters the building should be checked before they go in the building instead of half way through the building.
R:  Right.
L:  If they're -- if they're gonna do it.
R:  Right, as you come in the doors, you know, that's the first check --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah.  Because --
L:  And as you're --
R:  -- otherwise you get it in there, you could put it somewhere and, you know, go back --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- for it or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know, I -- I feel if they're gonna do security, let's do a whole security thing, check everybody with a metal detector when they walk in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and very possibly have the employees checked by a minimum of two other employees.
R:  Right, they should be able to -- or should b- go through something too before they go in.
L:  And they may.  They maybe --
R:  They may, yeah.
L:  -- have to be checked by one, but there could be two that are working together, so I really think it should be randomly selecting two other ...
