R:  Hi, my name is Monique.
L:  My name is Lana.
R:  Hi.  Um, [NOISE] this is my second time so [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- bear with me.  Um, so, the -- what do you think of the issue in the Middle East?
L:  Is it the peace on- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that they're doing a lo- -- a lot better now, since the -- I mean, I think now that the people over there are happy.
R:  Ah, when -- you're talking about the Iraqi people?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] Um, well, hopefully that's the case.  Ah, there's still [LIPSMACK] news about them, um, well, some of them I guess, ah, that are not satisfied with the current situation.  I think maybe some of them there are not just being patient enough because after all the war has just finished, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, they should give the Americans to, ah -- some time to, um, to put things back in order.  Things cannot be, um, obtained with- within just, ah, a matter of, ah, weeks or even months sometimes.  So ...
L:  Right.
R:  But what do you think?  Um, do you think, ah, it was right for us to go to war with Iraq just to, [MN] you know, what the -- the -- the problem they have over there?  Do you agree with that?
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah.  So, um --
L:  Do you?
R:  Ah, I think so.  [LAUGH] I'm like -- I'm -- I'm really supporting that, you know.
L:  Yeah, I am too.  I mean, [NOISE] Saddam, there's no telling what he would have done.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  I mean, it may not have happened recently --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But with giving him time.
R:  Right.  [MN] But do you think that, um, with this, ah, war winding there will be any other problem arises?  You know, may- -- we -- for example, right now, um, [MN] there have been, um, warnings that we've been giving to Syria.  Um, and there are talks about pe- perhaps there might be some, ah -- maybe we might be going to war with Syria.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, why do you -- what do you think of that?
L:  I think there's -- there's going to be continuous bouts of it.  I mean --
R:  Problem over there?
L:  Mhm.  I mean, I think different countries are going to start --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- start voicing their opinions on --
R:  Mhm.  [MN] Well, I -- I just think that th- th- the problem with -- in the Middle East just -- is a continuing problem.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's not going to ease out, um, even after the war in Iraq.  Maybe just a little bit there will be some, um, [LIPSMACK] positive come out of it in term of, um, peace in Middle East but I don't think it will be much.  I don't think this will be the answer to the peace in Middle East, e- especially if -- between Israel and the other Middle East countries.
L:  I don't either.  I think --
R:  Yeah.  Unfortunately, um, [MN] you know, this is some -- an issue that has been going on for decades.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even, I don't know, maybe even century.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I mean, I -- I know history a little bit, you know, back to the bible age, you know.  How the problems in the Middle East between Israel -- Israel and the Arab countries.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's going to be unfortunately a continuing issue.
L:  I agree with that.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, some people think it's a religion issue but I think it's more than that.  It's, ah, you know -- a- a lot of it is -- have something to do with, ah, the fight over land.
L:  Mm.
R:  And that started all of it.  So ...  [MN] But how -- how has this, ah, Middle -- have this Middle East issue have affected your life at all in a way?
L:  In a way, I guess.
R:  Yeah?  Wh- -- have you been watching, um, the news a lot --
L:  Yes, I have.
R:  -- because of this?
L:  Yup.
R:  Yeah.  Before that did you have any interest in this?
L:  Not really.
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  I mean. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, th- -- did it just started because of the war, or what?
L:  Well --
R:  The interest in it?
L:  Well, I mean, on TV they really wouldn't really show anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about it.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- until there was a threat of war --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  But before that when there were problem with the, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, the suicide bombers in -- in, ah, Israel?  Were you in- into it at all?  I mean, did you follow the news on that too?
L:  No.
R:  Not really?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Yeah.  That's an unfortunate thing.  I -- I was following the news on that and it's just heartbreaking, every time you hear the news about, you know, how innocent people got killed for -- ah, well, [MN] to the Arabs maybe it's something that they really believe.  Unfortunately a lot of the suicide bombers there sort of, [LIPSMACK] um, I would say got fooled by the -- their leaders, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They were promised a lot of money and, um, what they're going to get in heaven.  [LAUGH] That's kind of --
L:  Huh.
R:  That's kind of weird but that's what they believe that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they die doing -- carrying the mission, you know, as a suic- suicide bomber, they said they -- they can get, um, a lot of, ah, things when they get to heaven.  And a lot of it too, they do it in motiv- motivation of, um -- for their -- their living relatives or family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're -- they are promised a lot of, um, [LIPSMACK] money and a lot of fame, I guess.  They're --
L:  [MN] They may be scared of their leader.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Or --
R:  But, you know, they -- they get some kind of f- fame if they're, um, they die [LAUGH] as a suicide bomber.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Weird as it is but that's -- that's what's going on over there.  [MN] So, um, um, are you a student or ...?
L:  No.
R:  Ah, a- --
L:  Um, I'm a stay at home mom right now.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  So, um, do you read news from the internet or just --
L:  Mostly from the internet.
R:  -- from TV?  Yeah, [MN] that's good.  Well --
L:  What do -- what do you do?
R:  I, um, I work.  I, ah, I work only part time so I have quite a bit of time to [LAUGH] go on it and kind of follow the news, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I- the problem in the Middle East it -- wasn't really my -- my interest but because of, um, a lot of turmoil there, I guess, that's what got Bush on the -- on TV and on n- newspaper a lot.  So, most of the time it's the main headline everywhere.
L:  Yeah, I m- --
R:  So we're just gonna --
L:   I mostly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mostly follow things that's going on around in the United States.
R:  Mhm, [MN] yeah.  So, unfortunately you're kind of sucked into it whether you want it or not because it -- that's just a main headline, [LAUGH] you know, on the news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or on TV and everything.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, but hopefully it'll [MN] all slow down a little bit with, um, the problems over there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the war winding down and everything.  [MN] But, ah, it's interesting how, um, the news just [MN] um, telling us about how the regime in Iraq had lived, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How they lived, um, lavishly and a lot of items they found in their homes are la- really American items.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, ah, um, they drink a lot of, ah, alcohol and, um, they -- they have a lot of, um, kind of like just American stuff in there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  While they're continually telling their people over there how they ha- they hate the Americans.
L:  Yup.
R:  And it's really [MN] [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] thei- their people probably just now really finding out the truth, you know.  They probably haven't -- they have a -- a -- a little bit of a -- the idea of these leaders, you know, what kind of money they're taking from their people.  But now that's really unfolding they're really seeing t- the extent of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  I mean, like, some of them were scared because if they even supported our troops that they would be killed.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Did you read the news about how, um, a couple of American, um, [LIPSMACK] soldiers found, like, six hundred and fifty million dollars hi- hidden in one of the Iraqi leaders home?
L:  No, I haven't heard that one.
R:  Yeah, that was on the -- on the papers the other day.  That's six hundred and fifty million dollars in cash.
L:  God.
R:  Cash, [LAUGH] yeah.  And that's just from one -- from one, um, of the leaders home.  [MN] Ah, that's not even Saddam's home. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] No wonder all these people were taking things.
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's ridiculous.
L:  I mean --
R:  Tha- that- that's a lot of
