R:  Hello.
L:  H- Hi, I'm Kathy.
R:  Hi, I'm Brad.
L:  Okay, and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- out topic is airport security.
R:  Correct.
L:  Um, I guess th- they had asked wh- -- um, do we think that -- do I think that airport security lessens terrorist actions in the air?  And I guess, I don't think it'll eliminate it but I guess there's a small chance that it probably does, uh, lessen it to some extent so I don't mind waiting in long lines and all the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the stuff that's going on in airports.  How about --
R:  Yeah, I definitely agree with that.  I've actually not really flown a lot, but I've flown quite a few times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- recently within the past few years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And some of the security measures I think are really good like how they check all the checked luggage now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean there's nothing that I think they should've done a long time ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just because -- I mean, granted, we pay a little more to fly and have a little more time invested in flying process now, but if they don't have any security measures I think that it'd be too big of an opportunity for something to happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If that makes any sense.
L:  Yeah, no, I agree.  I think that -- I -- I've -- I don't fly a lot for business any more, um, I used to, but I know that people that fly like every day or every week day, they -- they're -- they didn't like the airport security measures, they were -- it took too long to stand in line and so forth --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but their attitude's changed a little bit, especially after September eleventh when -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when that happened and people are like, "I don't mind the security issues", um, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- having to wait in line and stuff as much, so [MN], I think that helps us realise how the -- the need for security and helped us not really mind so much, uh, standing in line and all the [SIGH] -- the stuff that goes on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know, I was at the airport, uh, about a year or so ago.  I saw someone, uh -- one woman was wearing like high heeled boots or something and they w- -- she had to take off her shoes because they -- they -- I guess they had a m- metal plate in the soles or something and, you know, she was wearing boots and tight pants and she practically -- you know, you she had to go into the bathroom and take the pants off so that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she could get the long boots off and all that.  You know, and so she was complaining about that, but I -- I think that's just -- she just wasn't dressed appropriately.  If you know that that's potentially going to happen you don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- dress in that manner.  So, I think as long as they let us know what the security measures are and what we can do to make things easier at the checkpoints, that that's -- you know, I don't have a problem with that.
R:  Yep.  And they do -- I think they do a pretty good job telling people what they can and can't bring on --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- checked luggage and through the metal detectors.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think if everybody followed those, the process would be a lot quicker too because they wouldn't have so many people they'd have to be checking bags for and --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's -- that's true, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Although I guess they still do, um -- there was a news story recently that I saw where they talked about the number of things that are confiscated at the airport checkpoints and people would just forgot -- forget that in their purse or in their bag that they were carrying like a fingernail file or something that they didn't realise was prohibitive that -- but that -- that was considered a sharp object or a metal object that was potentially bad and they were saying they just, you know, collected tons of stuff and they were donating --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it to charity [LAUGH]. Be- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, because people -- I mean, I guess people could have it mailed to them but the- -- you have to pay for the postage and people didn't want to wait around and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- fill out forms and all that stuff.
R:  Yeah, a lot of times it's probably like a fingernail clipper, it's probably cheaper just to go to the store and buy a new one.
L:  Well, that's true.  That's very true, yeah, yeah.  Um, I can't think -- when they say airport security -- I can't think of other stuff.  Oh, I guess one thing is if when -- if I pick -- if I'm picking someone up at the airport, one of the things they're doing is they're not letting you like p- pull up and park next to the curb.  So, if I -- if I know someone's coming and I s- -- you know, I say -- rather than having to park and pay the parking lot fee and all that and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I can say, "Just meet -- I'll -- I'll be there around three thirty", and if they -- they get off the plane and they call and say, "I'm here", and -- and I go to the airport and I say, "I'll pick you up in front of like the south west gate", um, I -- I -- sometimes it's blocked off and they -- they -- they have police out in front and they don't want cars stopping there and they won't really let you stop even for a minute to l- -- to let someone jump in the car with you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kind of annoying.  I like the idea of being able to pick someone up at -- you know, not having to park and go into the building.  I like being able to just meet someone at the curb and so I still think they should allow people to kind of like hang out at the curb.  Not for a long period of time, but for a -- a minute or two so that someone can see that you're there and get in the car, but that was --
R:  Yeah, I think as long as you're at the car I think you should be okay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, if someone like were to leave their car and go inside the airport and try to find someone then --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- yeah, 'cause I could see how --
L:  Yeah, no, that's not --
R:  -- that would be a problem.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But just stopping and having somebody help get in baggage or something's kinda --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Doesn't make much sense.
L:  What city are you in?  What airport -- what city are you in?
R:  I'm right now in Spokane, Washington --
L:  Okay --
R:  -- for college --
L:  -- is -- is there --
R:  -- but Portland, Oregon for home.
L:  Okay, so is there like a large airport in Spokane?
R:  Um, Spokane has an airport that -- it's an international one but it's pretty small --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- but the Portland airport's my home airport, I call it, and --
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  -- it's pretty big international airport, so --
L:  It is, okay.  'Cause I live in Phoenix and we have a fairly large airport with --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- something like three --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- separate terminals and things, but, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you -- you can get in and out pretty quickly and, uh -- and it seems like, um, the security precautions that -- right after September eleventh they were a little stricter.  Now, people seem to be get- -- be able to get on and off the plane, um, and it doesn't like take quite as long but they -- they still recommend going early and so forth --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, y- y- you hope that it -- it -- it does something to prevent terrorism.  You know, you hope that the people -- I guess there's a way of getting around an- anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, y- you hope that all the extra effort -- you know, now they're paying federal marshals instead of regular employees to be --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the -- the -- the, uh, people that stand there at the -- at the stations to monitor people through and you hope that all the extra expense is gonna make some deterrent, but I think like if there's a -- a determined terrorist he can have like a plastic knife or something that he could actually use if he wanted to, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  As a -- as a weapon that would -- that would bypass metal detectors, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I also think it's interesting 'cause this is something fairly recent within the past few months.  It's our airline, so no longer -- like actually on the flight you can't have a line forming from the bathroom any more.
L:  Oh, is that true?  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.  So, like if there's somebody in the lavatory they have that little light on the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ceiling and --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- you can't stand up unless you need to just stretch or something.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that, so you can't go back --
R:  You they're getting -- you can't just walk around like you used to if you need to stretch or anything any more.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, I didn't --
R:  Makes it bad for long flights. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah.  Well, and some people -- you know if y- -- some people have medical conditions and need to get up and walk around and stuff, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, that's inter- --
R:  Yeah, maybe if you let the airline know in advance for medical they might allow it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, not sure about if you don't let them know.
L:  I didn't know that.  Is -- was that just across the board or is that just in certain airlines?
R:  Um, it's an FAA thing.
L:  Oh --
R:  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  'Cause I've flown Southwest quite a few times and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- every time they say, "Due to new like FAA regulations we are no longer allowed to people do this".
L:  Oh, wow, see I haven't flown recently so -- sin- since they've done that, so I'd never heard that before.  That's interesting.  I guess they don't want people loitering in the isle way, huh?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, o- okay, uh ...
R:  And then like inside the airport, um -- I go into the Salt Lake one for a connecting flight and they had one of those [inaudible] diners there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I was kinda surprised 'cause they gave you plastic silverware 'cause they're not allowed to give out metal silverware any more.
L:  In -- on the plane, or in the actual, uh --
R:  Um, in the airport.  So --
L:  Oh, in the airplane, so they don't want you -- oh, oh that makes sense.
R:  So, like you went there and ordered like -- somebody in my group ordered like a mini steak --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then they got plastic silverware and they were kinda like, "How am I supposed to cut this?" Like, "Well, we don't have any sharp knives in the back either, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  "-- we can't really help you".
L:  That's interesting. No wonder --
R:  So ...
L:  -- they've got lots of fast food stuff in the hallway. [LAUGH] Huh.  I never thought about that, but that makes sense too, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's kind of weird 'cause I guess before September eleventh all those restaurants could have like big knives and stuff that were never allowed in the airport to --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- begin with.
R:  Sure, yeah.
L:  But, I mean, of course any fast food people could easily pass that off to someone if they knew someone --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- so I just think it's kinda weird that that was something that was allowed for so long that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- seems like something that n- never should've been allowed.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Well, I think September eleventh really opened up a lot of eyes to -- for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people in a lot of areas.  You wouldn't think that that would be something to look at, um -- th- the restaurants and stuff but I -- you know, after the fact like you said, now that you think about it, it really probably shouldn't have ever been allowed but wh-, you know, who knew?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Oh, I'm trying to think of other security things that -- the parking in front of the airport, the security gates, um -- I know, I -- I -- went and met my, uh, brother.  He came to visit and I have a -- a young -- a young baby in a -- in a stroller and I asked if I could bring -- you know, go to -- to meet him at the gate rather than having to wait, you know when they come out -- you know how you can't go to the gate if you're not a passenger?
R:  Correct.
L:  And -- and, um, at the America West counter I was able to go ahead and get a pass to get down there to meet him at the -- at the gate which I thought was kind of nice, but I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I did -- I did have to go through special stuff and they did want a picture ID and so forth, so it's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- nice they kind of make allowances.  They're not being real hard nosed about, "No, you can't.  It's an absolute rule", I m-, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  Pardon?
R:  Oh, um, I go to Eastern Washington when our basketball team went to a national conference --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we had some agreement with the airport that if our team did win --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anyone with a scorer[?] ID card could go past the checkpoint and they would have like the band and cheerleaders meet them at the actual terminal too.
L:  Oh, to be able to actually greet them and they were going to allow that?
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we didn't win, so that didn't happen, but [LAUGH] --
L:   Oh, well --
R:  -- that's a different story.
L:  It's nice though they would make allowances for stuff like that.  That -- that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is nice.  But, I'm -- I'm sure they wanted IDs and stuff and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm -- as a flyer I would comfortable with that, you know.
R:  Mhm.  And then of course it's one of those -- you had to directly to that south west gate and couldn't just walk ...
