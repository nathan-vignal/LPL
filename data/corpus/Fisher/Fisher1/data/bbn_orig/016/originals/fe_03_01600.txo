L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, uh, my name is Taio[?].
R:  My name is Terra.  I'm --
L:  I --
R:  I'm in Saint Louis, Missouri.  Where are you from?
L:  Um, uh, I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia?  
L:  Yeah --
R:  Oh, okay, cool --
L:  Mm.
R:  We're talking about airport security.
L:  Yeah, I guess so [LAUGH].
R:  So, uh, what do ya think?
L:  Um, [COUGH] well, I -- I mean -- I mean I guess it's -- it's good, I -- I mean --
R:  Do you travel much?
L:  Um, I -- I -- a little bit, I guess, like but not so much, um, since the, uh, since -- since the September eleventh attacks when all the --
R:  Yeah, me too [LAUGH].
L:  -- airport -- yeah --
R:  Kinda put a little scare in us, didn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am a little apprehensive and I -- and I do think that the added security is a good thing --
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, you know, I think we need to protect ourselves but, um, sometimes I wonder, um, if we're screening the right people, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then how do we know?  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how do we know?  You know, how do we know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, uh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I've been travelling a long time.  I'm -- I'm forty one.  You would sound a lot younger than me [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Ye- --
R:  I don't know how old you are, but I mean I've been travelling a long time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and -- and -- you know, on a l- -- you know, not that I travel frequently, I mean, it's not business, it's strictly pleasure, but I've been to Hawaii and -- and, um, Mexico and places a- away from, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where we're at, um, and I just think that, um, I don't know, I just -- it's -- it's a scary thing, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  We need to protect ourselves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I don't know.  What do you think?
L:  Oh --
R:  You sound a lot younger.  You're young- --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean I'm -- I'm, uh, twenty one --
R:  Oh, that's good -- that's good [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But you know it's like funny, like, how will that affect you?  You know, you're younger.  Will that affect how you travel with your family when you --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- get married and have children?  It might.
L:  That -- like the thing is like after the attacks I wasn't really, um -- I don't know 'cause I just thought of it like as a one in a million chance, you know?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's why like when a- after -- after the attacks like and after they beefed up security and everything, I didn't really feel like, "Oh, my goodness, my life is going to be next", so I didn't really change my, um, you know, m- my, m- my schedule as far as like flying and stuff --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- like that, so, um -- but yeah, but, more security is -- is, I mean, I guess, a good precaution --
R:  But you know wasn't it scary to think that like, um, you know, here you and I are, normal, obviously --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- normal American people.  They might be twenty years apart in age --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, we're just normal people and we want to go on about our lives, but yet, if we want to come visit each other, we might like be, you know, raked through the coals, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, a- and that's good, but -- and I don't know how they sort out you and I are good people, you know, good --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- American citizen people --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- that just want to go and visit each other.  You know, imagine, you know next weekend you want to come visit me and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the bullshit you're gonna go through to get out, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's so scary and -- and -- we want to be safe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know.  You know, we all want to be safe and we don't want to be scared, but I don't know where they draw the line or how do they decide?  I guess that's national security. 
L:  [MN] Y- --
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah --
R:  What do you think?
L:  I -- a- yeah, I -- I mean, I -- I -- w- well I don't know, um, mm ...
R:  [NOISE] Scary isn't it?
L:  Yeah, yeah, a little bit, like, w- yeah, when you think about it.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you know --
L:  It really is.
R:  -- it's like, where do we draw the line?  You know, where does our safety, you know, and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and the safety of a- -- where's that fine line and how does the government decide and how does security decide?  I -- we want to be s- -- I want to be safe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know about you, but I want to be safe --
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] I know.
R:  -- and I have travelled, I mean, every summer.  I mean, I've been married sixteen, s- oh, seventeen years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Every summer I've travelled by air with my children, um -- since I had children, that's been fifteen years since with my children --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- but, um -- and I've never felt scared, but I actually -- and this is good that they're recording this -- cancelled a trip next week.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh, because, um, all the schools -- the catholic schools in my area, um, are off for Spring Break --
L:  Right.
R:  And we were supposed to go on vacation and we cancelled it when the war started because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- we were afraid.  We did.  We cancelled it.
L:  I see.
R:  And -- the ec- -- the economy's not good and that was another reason, but it was mainly because I was too afraid.  My husband said, "Oh my god, well you know we're in war, you're not gonna travel by air".  You know, and I'm --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- so grateful that they're careful, but I was afraid.  So, I am a perfect person for them to be calling for this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, it did.  It caused us to cancel.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  No, I mean, I also think that it's like -- yeah, like c- 'cause I do think, uh, the -- well, I mean, I don't know if it's like the government or whatever they are, like, instilling fear in the -- in the -- in the, um, people and I really think, I don't know ... I -- I --
R:  I know.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's --
R:  I could talk about the government thing, but --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  I won't.
L:  Yeah, no, [LAUGH] I'm sure you could.
R:  It's funny that we have a President that was not elected by the popular people --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- and he's taken us to war.
L:  Exactly, now it's crazy.
R:  And that bothers me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You too?  Oh, good. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know, he is not our popular choice and now we're in one war and now he's talking about getting us into another war.
L:  Yeah, I -- I know.
R:  That's kind of a bother something to me and I, you know, I believe in my political party and I'm not going to get this into political things, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I don't know.  I just think, you know, he -- he strived on how he was so pro life for one thing --
L:  Mhm, Mhm.
R:  -- and yet then he goes into war and he kills all these people and all of our little --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- innocent boys -- I mean, you're twenty.  You said you were twenty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're twenty.  People your age --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- went to war and were killed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, it just --
L:  N- --
R:  -- bothers me.
L:  Yeah, it's hard to think about.
R:  It just bothers me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know and I listen to you and I think, you know, you're young and -- and I -- I don't feel that much older than you but I am and I think, "Oh, dear lord, it's just not right to do to people your age".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I me- -- you know, I just -- I don't know.  After September eleventh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we gotta figure something out but to make you and I live like we're slaves to getting on an airplane to see each other --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I don't know, but god, I don't want to see people your age going to war and getting killed.
L:  No, n- yeah, no, me neither.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  
L:  Yeah, it's really --
R:  I guess there's no easy way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, look at the age you are and I'm sure you know people that have gone over there.  I do, I know people and -- believe me, I'm forty one --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I know people who have kids that are there.
L:  Really?  I actually don't know anyone who's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- who's -- who's been over there.
R:  I -- I know a few and, uh, god it --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- kills me.  I just kills me.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It kills me.
L:  Wow.
R:  It just kills me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just -- I don't know.
L:  Mhm.  No, I know.  Yeah, so I guess -- yeah, and I think about -- yeah, like the whole thing of like s- airport security and like the whole homeland security with the red and the blue and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all -- you know, those, um, where they -- alert factors whatever, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they all serve a purpose, you know, to just keep us, um, you know -- and especially like, oh, lots of the people who probably think that the war is -- is needed, you know, 'cause ev- -- 'cause we're like -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, I know.
L:  -- now we're all like [inaudible] yeah.  So, that's how I feel about it when I'm like going through it and, um --
R:  I know, and I just -- I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  You know, I want the airlines to be safe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Dear lord, I want 'em to be safe because that's why I didn't actually go on vacation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't wanna not be a free country either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It puts us in a funny predicament.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, oh, I don't know --
L:  Yeah, really --
R:  -- this whole thing just, oh [SIGH], I just want things to get back to normal [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH], no.
R:  You know, and I just, huh -- and I just, I don't know.  I just ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, Clinton -- Clinton had his Monica Lewinski --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- scandals --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it was bad [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but you know what?  He might've been like an -- an ass of a person [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but at least he ran our country well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the economy was good and people worked --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and people weren't so worried.  God, the economy's horrible --
L:  It really is, I know --
R:  -- and nobody's working and things are horrible --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm like, you know, Mr Bush, I mean, I -- I don't know what's gonna happen, but he's never gonna gi- -- like he's gonna be like his daddy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  He didn't even win the popular vote to begin with --
L:  No.
R:  -- but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he should've tried to -- I don't know.
L:  Exactly, exactly -- like yeah, he just came --
R:  I mean, honestly to god, I'm a -- I'm a [LAUGH]-- I'm a Democrat so, [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I didn't want him to begin with.
L:  Me too, yeah --
R:  You too?  Okay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well me too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too.
