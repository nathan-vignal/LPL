R:  Hi, I'm Sarah, and I'm a nineteen year old college student and I just woke up.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, I'm Jennifer.  I'm, uh, twenty six.  I'm a graduate student.
R:  Okay, where do you go?
L:  Uh, the University of Michigan.
R:  Oh, I'm up in Michigan too.
L:  Oh, yeah?  Where --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where do you go?
R:  I go to Oakland Community College [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, how do you like that?
R:  It's okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- mostly because I'm like really poor and yeah -- 
L:  Well --
R:  I'm probably going to transfer down to Massachussetts next year.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] but it's okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But yeah, so what do you think about...  Are you for one thing or the other with the -- I'm gonna open my window.  Hang on.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Okay, but --
L:  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, personally, I think that we can get peace in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that area and I -- I think that the -- but the only way to do is to make a Palestinian State and really separate the groups who obviously can't get along when they're sharing space.
R:  [COUGH] What do you mean -- I'm kind of caught up on this but not as much as I should -- what do you mean, make a Palestinian State?
L:  Um, well just make -- take some of the land that's now Israel and make it a separate nation.  Just like we originally made Israel by just taking some land --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and saying, "Okay, here's a country for you".
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Let's see, what are my thoughts on [NOISE] it? 
L:  Hm.
R:  Do you know what?  Gee, what a great topic.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, my friends and I always talk about it but I can't seem to ... hm, let's see.  Well, I know that my friend is totally against the war 'cause he -- he's kind of like an extreme Christian and thinks that, you know, we shouldn't interfere with that stuff and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's okay that he thinks that but, I don't know.  I personally think that action does need to be taken to get done and although no one really likes war, sometimes it's -- as cliche as this is, sometimes it is necessary and I think in this case the risks outweighed the benefit of just staying uninvolved. 
L:  Yeah.  And do y- -- would you feel that way even if it turns out like we don't find any weapons, after we've been there for a while?
R:  Well, let's see, I don't know.  I think maybe that, mm, just the chance of there being weapons there would make it worth it, I suppose.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But he seems like a pretty dangerous guy anyways and I guess, you know, I can understand why Bush would wanna go in and just -- I guess this is one of the motives he used because he s- -- he said several things why he wanted to go over there and pull him out of his regime or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  But he seemed like he was a pretty bad dude and did a lot of terrible things to his people and stuff.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  [COUGH] And I -- I don't like that and I can see why he would wanna go over there and, you know, kind of interfere 'cause I guess it's a humane thing to do, to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- help out but, I don't know.
L:  Well, the thing that bothered me about it is I felt like that was just an excuse because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's, you know, things going on all over the world all the time where people could use our help and where we could help without violence and by spending no money whatsoever or, I mean, not -- you know, a lot less than we're spending on a war and remaking the country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like health crises in Africa and all these kind of things, so if he really just was saying, "Hey, I need to get rid of bad leaders and help people live better lives", then this is not what he would've chosen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I feel like he doesn't actually care about that, he's just using that to kinda bring some more people on board who wouldn't have been on board otherwise.
R:  Yeah, that's -- you know what, that is a good thought that I haven't thought about.  That if one of his reasons for going over there is because they live a bad life and we wanna, you know, help make it better.  But I don't know.  How much -- a lot of people are using the -- the excuse that he wants the oil from that area, but doesn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- France get most of their oil from that area and we get most of it from Canada, so that's not really much of a factor?
L:  Yeah, I think that's true, um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I don't -- you know, I don't really follow that aspect of it that much so I don't know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- all the facts behind that, but -- but, yeah, so that might -- that seemed like it was a -- even a bigger argument when his father went.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That they -- so maybe like after that war we changed where we got most of our oil perhaps.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  And what do you think about Bush's, "He tried to kill my daddy".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that just doesn't ...
R:  I think that was a bad move, uh, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with public relationsly[?]. 
L:  Definitely.  I mean, you know, he really like tries to be that kind of Texas guy where -- like when we were looking for Osama Bin Laden at first --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and he was saying, you know, "There's this old poster in the West that says, 'Wanted Dead or Alive'".  That's not how Presidents should talk I don't think.  I know he's from Texas and that's how --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Texans talk, but that just seems to me now very Presidential to say things like that.
R:  I know.  I definitely should get with the big like diplomatic mess because I think, just from what I know, in the wake of trying to get the, uh, UN to come on with us --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to fight in Iraq or, you know, to at least aggressively press Saddam for whether or not he had weapons --
L:  Mhm.
R:  We kind of like insulted the UN by saying that we don't need their help and that even if they don't comply with us we're going to, you know, go against what they say and go into Iraq and, you know, aggressively take action or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  But, like, you know, that kind of scared me because, I don't know, it's -- what's the UN for?  I mean, it was created so we can have like a global -- I don't know what I want to say here.
L:  No, I totally know what you mean.  If -- you know, what's the point of having such an organisation if you're not going to abide by its wishes and agree with the group consensus about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's the right thing to do?
R:  Yeah, and I think it's good that we have, you know, a place where we can all send somebody and, you know, we can all talk about it.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I don't know.  I just -- we kind of didn't even think twice about it [COUGH].  About just going against what they said, or what they advised.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  And we've been doing that for a while, like refusing to go with international rules about environmental standards and about getting rid of land mines.  Like we wouldn't sign onto the anti landmine bill and, you know, all these kind of things that we're just kind of getting more and more estranged from the international community.  It's really kinda scary, I think.
R:  Yeah, that is true. [COUGH] What other things about this were there?  Hm, you know what?  What's the -- what's the situation over there right now?
L:  Uh, in Iraq?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [MN] I -- well, the person who's -- who Bush chose to be the -- the civil commander until we get an actual Iraqi government in place --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just arrived like yesterday so, I guess --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- the first thing is he's gonna be -- he said he was trying to, you know, get the water and electricity back on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and get food distributed was his first priority and -- and then move onto, uh, you know, more complicated things I guess in getting the government set up, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he's already getting criticized for something or other.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, uh -- oh, one thing is that he just took so long to get there.  Like why did he -- why wasn't he there weeks ago?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  But, [LAUGH] I guess he had other things to do.  I don't know.
R:  Mhm.  Hm.
L:  That's the last thing I heard.
R:  [COUGH] Well, that's okay.  And they haven't found any like weapons of mass +destruction or anything, right?
L:  No, I mean, they found like, you know, a few of those torture looking rooms --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but they haven't found anything -- any weapons as far as I've heard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  [SIGH] So, I don't know, was it worth it, if we don't find anything?  I guess it was good that we freed the people from his regime.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know if -- we didn't satisfy the, uh, going in there to, you know, disarm him.
L:  Right.
R:  And that means he wasn't breaking his side of the treaty then.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, that's -- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  If he had been I think that would be a good -- yeah, this is one of my reasons for, you know, thinking that taking aggressive action against him was justified.  If he did break his end of the treaty I think that, you know, he should pay for it, you know, just -- just like if we broke our end they'd probably make us pay, I guess.
L:  Right, definitely.
R:  But I don't even know what our end of the deal was, so --
L:  I don't think we really had -- there was anything required of us like it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of like in Japan after World War Two, you know, they were defeated by us and so they just basically had to do whatever we said.  If we said, "Get rid of your military", they had to do it and we --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- didn't have to do anything.
R:  [LAUGH] [COUGH]
L:  But, uh -- or like Germany the same thing.
R:  Poor other countries.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you ever been to another country?
L:  I haven't actually.
R:  Okay, 'cause I've been to Japan before.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Just for a -- like a summer as an exchange student but it's so cool and, you know what, I really wanna -- I think it would be really cool to get involved in, uh, just something that would allow me to travel to different places.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm thinking about going into politics, but I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And for saying that I really should be more like well buffed on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the Middle East situation, but I guess it just didn't click well [LAUGH].
L:  Well, you know -- I mean, some -- some issues rile you up more than others and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you pay attention to them better.
R:  [COUGH] [SIGH] Definitely.
L:  Well, I actually just thought, you know, speaking about the weapons and whether or not we found any --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I thought something pretty scary and I don't think they have any evidence of this but it's just sort of the journalists speculating --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That with all the looting and everything, it's possible that people took, you know, canisters of anthrax and all these kind of things and that they're now sort of distributed amongst the population and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- are actually more dangerous now because they can ...
