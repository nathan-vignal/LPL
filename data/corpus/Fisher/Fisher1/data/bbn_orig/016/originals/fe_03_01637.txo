L:  Hi, my name is Jay.
R:  Hi, my name is Amy. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, Amy, how are you? 
R:  I'm fine, how are you? 
L:  Oh, pretty good.  So, ah, this is an interesting topic. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  A little bit of a hot topic there.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, ah, --
R:  To start you off with. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, ah, what's -- so, ah, --
R:  I don't know, I disagree with it [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I -- pretty much myself as well.  It's funny though, I did get a, um, an email this morning from a family friend, she's actually a -- a pilot in the -- for the marines.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And she had a really long email, pretty interesting account of -- of a lot of the runs that she was doing and she had this one account where this one soldier came up and thanked her --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- apparently they were pinned down in one area and they -- and they managed to, ah, -- I mean, they -- they -- she essentially dropped a bomb on this shack where they're being fired from.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] And, um, you know, so it's kind of -- it's -- it's a tough call, you know, between the troops.
R:  It is just, you know, I mean, you don't want to not -- I mean, the people that are doing that, you know, are putting their lives at risk and stuff, you have to respect that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, so it's tough, you know, to -- at least for -- for myself.  I -- I don't really support Bush but it seems --
R:  Bush, on the other hand, I have no respect for. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't have to respect him. [LAUGH]
L:  Right on, yeah.  It's funny, we -- we call him shrub.
R:  Yeah, I think a lot of people are calling, that's one of the nicer things I hear him called. [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, let's see, what else.  What -- in regards to, ah, peace, do you ever think it will end up happening in the Middle East? 
R:  I don't know, it's a pretty scary situation, you know.  I don't know that -- how much people in the Middle East really want it.
L:  Can you hear that noise in the background? 
R:  It's a fuzzy noise.
L:  Okay, I'm not sure.  Um, yeah, it is a pretty interesting situation.  I'm not sure that, um, -- I'm not sure that it's gonna take someth- -- I -- I guess, um, the Israeli Palestinian conflict is -- is a bit more --
R:  Yeah, I mean -- 
L:  In depth.  I'm not sure that's ever gonna be resolved.
R:  I mean, you could -- one would always hope for peace and a happy resolution but the way things are going now, I just don't see it headed that way.
L:  I think -- I think the Israelis would have to give back the Palestinian lands to Palestinians and, um, it's funny --
R:  If they ever want to have peace I think that's the only way that it will ever happen.
L:  Yeah.  Because that --
R:  They're not gonna just go away. [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's almost as if the Palestinians don't have anything to lose at this point.  I mean, if you don't --
R:  Well, they've locked everything already.
L:  Right.  It's funny how the US hasn't in- intervened on that situation yet.
R:  Well, there's no money in it for us, you know.
L:  Yeah, well I -- I -- there's quite a bit of it, the Israeli lobby -- 
R:  That too.
L:  Um, and --
R:  Definitely.
L:  So, which part of the country are you from?
R:  Um, I live just outside Seattle.
L:  Oh, okay, so do we -- so do I.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's probably -- that's probably why we have similar opinions. [LAUGH]
R:  Could be.  Not exactly your most, ah, right wing area.
L:  No.  It's -- it's odd to listen to those opinion polls in regards to the whole war and the Middle East.  It doesn't seem like, um, that, ah, -- yeah, it doesn't seem that, like that could actually be true, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Say like eighty, seventy per cent of the people support the war and, you know, what does that mean?  No one ever gives any statistics.
R:  I don't know but people -- of the people I know it's not seventy per cent. [LAUGH] It's kind of strange.  I guess it depends on where you are -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  Although I have a lot of relatives in Texas and they're -- they're very behind Bush.
L:  They're very what? 
R:  They're very behind Bush, they love him.
L:  Oh, that's scary.
R:  I try to -- [LAUGH] try to talk to them. [LAUGH]
L:  You don't want to ru- ruin your relationship with them.
R:  Exactly.  It's like "Oh, merry Christmas, [LAUGH] let's not talk about anything else".
L:  Um, interesting.  So -- so, you wouldn't vote for Bush? 
R:  Oh, I -- yeah, definitely not.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I did not vote for him. 
L:  Did you --
R:  Would not vote for him. 
L:  Did you vote for --
R:  Couldn't have voted for his Dad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Did you vote for Nader? 
R:  No, I didn't vote for Nader because I kind of felt like he split the vote of, ah, other side and made it so that there's no way that Gore could win, although Gore's an idiot, too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just didn't think -- we didn't have a very good opponent, you know.
L:  Yeah.  It wa- -- I -- I voted for Nader and I don't -- I wouldn't do it again at the Presidential level just because, um, I think there was a lot of talk about how the two were, um, -- ah, so, there wasn't much difference between Gore and Bush but I think that there -- Bush is really, really a whole lot worse. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I don't think that Gore would have had us a war like this over the Middle East.  I don't think he would have handled the whole September eleven thing the same way.
L:  Yeah, yeah, the p- patriot act and the whole dep- department of homeland security.
R:  I mean, especially I don't actually want people to be able to bug my phone without my permission for no reason, you know.  I actually thought my civil liberties were important but I guess, you know, [LAUGH] I guess I was mistaken.
L:  Yeah.  And so --
R:  It's still -- still disturbing to me.
L:  So do you know anyone whose been sent over to the Middle East? 
R:  Um, no, actually, all my friends are, you know, older.  I'm thirty but most of the people I know are, you know, they're too old to be drafted and -- 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- have kids and --
L:  So what about any -- do you have any friends from the Middle East? 
R:  Um, I have -- in New York I have a lot of friends who are, ah, Arabic.  Not around here, I don't know any Arabic people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Pretty -- I don't know, maybe because I live on the east side, you know [inaudible].
L:  Well, I work at the university and, um, th- there are --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- quite a few, um, people here.  There's a Turkish girl I work with and she was saying that all the Turkish men between the ages of like seventeen and like thirty five have had to register with -- with, ah, the INS.
R:  Well, see, I mean that to me, I mean that's totally not right.  You know, I mean, what, because you're Turkish, you're -- you know, I mean, are we going to start putting them in camps like we did with the Japanese in World War Two?  I mean --
L:  Well, th- -- a lot of them have been -- I guess -- I mean, her concern is a lot of them have been called on [NOISE] specific, ah, like, violations or, you know, they are just paying a lot more attention to their immigrant status and, um, -- 
R:  See, I mean, I think that's not really fair.  I mean, it's not -- it's -- it would be one thing if -- if they have some reason to investigate people but just to do it just for the sake of doing it, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I wonder if they actually get anything out of it or if it's just sort of a front to try to cover their bases so they can tell people they're investigating terrorist activities, which is ki- -- now it's been the sort of defensive catch phrase to allow people to -- to, ah, -- you know, essentially it's -- you know, like, in the name of terrorism now you can get away with anything.  It's just sort of what Israel has been doing.
R:  Hello?
L:  I'm sorry? 
R:  Oh, sorry. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  Stupid cell phone signal.
L:  Oh, you're on a cell phone? 
R:  Yeah.  I am calling [inaudible] but [inaudible]. 
L:  Um, let's see, what else.  We are supposed to talk for ten minutes, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's like, no, no, you know, I don't even talk to my friends for ten minutes. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, yeah, I mean, I don't know, I think it's just the whole world situation, it's just a scary thing.
L:  It was funny, they had a -- a sh- -- a discussion on NPR.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  With actually Rick Steves.  Have you -- have you heard of Rick Steves through the back door? 
R:  Oh, no, I haven't.
L:  He's kind of this, ah, let's go guide but he kind of does his own deal, he gets people over -- students over to Europe, how to travel Europe chea- cheaply, but he's a pretty interesting guy and he was on NPR, they interviewed him and -- and he was talking about how he, um, [LIPSMACK] -- how in Turkey it's a -- a very different, um, sort of scene, it's a very, um, sort of very -- very well educated population.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  And they're very secular, there's -- there's this -- there's a conscientious and, um, legal separation between church and state there, even though it's, like, ninety nine per cent Muslim. 
R:  I mean, you wish they'd have that here.
L:  Yeah, there's -- there's that too. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I thought we did -- we're -- legally we are suppose to but we really just don't any more.
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of -- yeah, fuzzy, fuzzy lines.
R:  Getting fuzzier every day it seems like.  I know this thing for me was that my brother, who, um, he was in the army during the last Gulf War.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When he went in the army he had gotten out but, you know, for, like, a couple of years they can still call you up and he [inaudible] for consciousness status but he wouldn't [inaudible] he spent [inaudible] fighting with the government [inaudible] for it but now he is saying that he thinks it's good that they're over there fighting now that he doesn't have to go.
L:  Ha, that's weird.
R:  I thought that was a -- really a little bit [LAUGH] messed up of him.
L:  Well, it's -- 
R:  Awfully easy to be, ah, pro war when you are no longer, you know, on the line.
L:  Yeah, there's -- there's that --
