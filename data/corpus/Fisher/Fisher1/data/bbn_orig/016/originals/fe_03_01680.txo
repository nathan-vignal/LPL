R:  [NOISE] Hi.  My name's PJ. 
L:  Hi.  My name is Donna.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you want to start or would you like me to start? 
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] you can.
L:  Um, I actually am really bad about following current events.  I watch a lot of cartoons, unfortunately.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But what I do know is actually from my boyfriend who is from Palestine --  
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- so I guess it may be a little biased. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that must be like an interesting slant on it [LAUGH] because [MN] [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, I know.  It's very interesting, actually.
R:  Does he relate, like, the events to Palestine with events to Iraq?
L:  Um, a little bit.  I mean, he just mainly talks about, like, more like, you know, the religion in the area and just the fact, that, um, -- he doesn't really talk much about Iraq.  I guess he is more like about Palestine and Jordan -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but he does talk a lot about, like, the people that live in that area and he was giving me, like, a whole history lesson, like who exactly is considered Arab and, like, the different religions in the area and stuff.
R:  Oh, wow, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So far -- 
L:  I don't like war.  I'm very anti war. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So am I.  I think maybe it had to be done, but I'm, like, really glad it's over and -- 
L:  I'm not -- yeah, I'm with you.  I'm just not sure what exactly they thought that they were going to accomplish.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, but ... I guess -- I guess the regime change is the main thing, though, because now, like, the Iraqi people have a chance to start over, to at least, you know, -- I don't think they necessarily need to be free, like, have a -- [inaudible] be -- be free, but I don't think they necessarily have to have like an American democracy.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  I mean, just [MN] so they're not tortured and stuff.
L:  I know.  I don't -- see, I mean, everybody does things differently and I just feel that, you know, that America shouldn't go in and, like, you know, change because they -- they'd definitely want to change it to like capitalism or some type of government -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- where, like, we could control in trade and -- and [inaudible] like and everybody benefit and to me that's just wrong.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, not to say, like, I'm pro Saddam, but -- 
R:  No, I -- 
L:  -- hopefully something good will come out of it.
R:  Yeah, I know what you mean because, like, in Afghanistan right now people are having a fit because they're, like, the Afghani government doesn't want them to watch eastern TV or whatever -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and stuff and it's, like, whoa, okay, [LAUGH] they're allowed to be different from us, they don't have to be little America clones, you know.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I --
R:  I mean, I love America and I'm glad I'm here.  I wouldn't want to live in one of those countries, but that doesn't mean they have to be just like us.
L:  Yeah, I know, I definitely agree with you.  I'm kind of pissed off at America, though, for the simple fact that if you -- if you're trying to travel or go outside of America, it's so hard now -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, to leave the country if you want to travel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a pain.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I wonder what type of government they're going to put in.  I'm sure they have, like, ideas already about who they want.
R:  Yeah.  I hope they -- I hope they let the Iraqi people actually choose, though, because we really don't want America to appoint someone to go in there, 'cause that would make no sense.
L:  I know.  
R:  That -- 
L:  That would be awful.
R:  If we, like, put [inaudible] the army or something in charge, that would -- it would sort of defeat the purpose of us going over there, but -- 
L:  I know.  I'm kind of mad, like, I feel, like, we weren't given the whole story either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I feel, like, we were fed, like, a lot of propaganda and it's just, like, we don't really know, like, what, you know, what hap- -- not what happened, but I guess, like, -- I'm a bit of a skeptic so I'm, like, I never quite believe anything that I hear.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I'm, like, wondering, like, exactly -- there has to be something else because the war was kind of quick, like, it was all hyped up but then, like, now it's over.
R:  Yeah.  And if you watch, like, either, like, the different networks on television, you will have, like, a totally different story and so it's, like, "Okay, someone's not telling us the truth".
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  And it's -- and it's probably stuff like that they don't even know that they couldn't tell us that our government's just, like, concealing stuff just because that's the way it works in war, you know, there's propaganda and stuff.  Like, all the other wars that we have had, like years later they'll say, "Oh, and now we've found out that this happened in the war" and no-one knew at the time, so I have a feeling there's going to be stuff like that about this war, too.
L:  I know.  I wonder what happens when, like, -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like, our kids or whatever are reading about this, like, what the books will say, because you know when you read about, like, other wars y- you wonder, like, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with wars, like, how much of the truth that is or -- I think it would be very interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hope it -- I hope there's no more, like, I hope they got their oil or whatever they wanted and we don't have to do this again. 
R:  [SIGH] Yes, I hope so too.  What [inaudible]
L:  And I blame Florida for this. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If they -- if Gore had been elected this probably wouldn't have happened.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this the first time that you've done this phone thing?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Yeah, I just [several inaudible words] or something.  I don't know, like three days ago I guess it [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  Where are you from? 
L:  Saint Thomas.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool.  I'm from Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  What part?  I just bought ferrets like outside of Philadelphia, [LAUGH] so I know --
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] it's, like, I'm more interested in -- 
R:  I'm more of -- I'm more of a [several inaudible words] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Like [several inaudible words] and everything's related to that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Like, what else?  I don't know, I wish I knew more about, like, the war, but I really do not pay attention.
R:  [LAUGH].  It's hard not to.  I like [several inaudible words] where I go to school they have it on everywhere, like, -- like, [inaudible] everybody has the TVs and radios on, too, [several inaudible words] find it hard to avoid.  I'm, like, deliberately [inaudible] like, "Okay, this is enough war stuff, I've got to stop watching it" because it -- it just gets overwhelming, you know.
L:  Yeah, it -- yeah, I guess so.
R:  And it gets --
L:  I don't know, I just feel, uh, it's unfortunate that, um, I guess because I wasn't, like, directly, directly affected, like, you know, there weren't any drafts and there weren't -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, so I didn't -- I tried not to pay attention.  I was very successful. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah.  I'm more, like, I guess because of my boyfriend, I'm more, like, interested in what's going on in, like, Palestine and Israel and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, [several inaudible words].  It's weird because you are hearing about [several inaudible words] so involved with themselves they are [inaudible] -- 
L:  Yeah, I know, it's so bad.  It was so sad, he, um, his grandmother died and he tried to go home to Palestine and they, like, wouldn't, like, let him into the country.
R:  Really?
L:  So he just had to, like, turn around and come back.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  Yeah.  So it really [inaudible]. 
R:  Just because, like, the US Palestine relations or -- 
L:  Well, more because, like, um, [MN] see, his mum is from Jordan, his dad is from Palestine and, like, apparently there's three check points and, like, his dad is actually one of the ministers of Palestine, so it was more because of that -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- that they were, like, -- yeah, they were, like, "No, go back". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ... [several inaudible words] 
R:  Does he ever -- 
L:  Wow, I'm, like, is it not ten minutes yet? [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Does he ever think there will be peace over there, with Palestine and Israel?
L:  I don't know.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't know.  Religion is so funny, like, [MN] my friends say religion has killed more people than, like, all diseases combined or something and -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't -- I don't know. [several inaudible words]  
R:  [inaudible] It's so weird because religion really does, like, even, like, in, um, Ireland, it's, like, Protestants and Catholics fighting [inaudible].  Over here you don't even think about that.
L:  I know.
R:  It seems so weird to have -- 
L:  People still fighting over religion.
R:  Yeah.  And that's, like, crusades, that's, like, ancient history. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  That's how it feels.  [several inaudible words] I don't -- I don't know.  It's a lot of, like, I don't know, religion and racism and everything else, it's just, like, stuff like that will never go away, so I just wonder --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what will happen.
R:  I'm afraid this war has sparked more, like, racism and, like, September eleventh and stuff, like people see someone who is Arabic and get all paranoid and stuff just because they're Arabic.
L:  I know.
R:  [several inaudible words] it just seems like wrong [LAUGH], just, like.  "No".
L:  It was so sad.  I remember, like, um, a month after September eleventh I got in a taxi cab -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, the guy had a thing that was like, "I am not", like, "I am not from such and such, I am, like, something else", you know, just trying to explain it, like, "I am a peaceful people" or, "If you're curious about my religion" and put like a link up. 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And that's like really sad that you have to, like, justify who you are -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so it's, like, people were -- I felt so bad, it was, like, it almost made me want to cry when I, like, got in the cab.  I was, like, absolutely [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, it is, [NOISE] probably in reaction to stuff people said, though, which is awful.
L:  Yeah.  It is bad.  I guess everyone kind of felt that initial like, you know, anger and, like, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hatred, but it shouldn't, like, -- I mean of course everyone got mad but then for people to just, you know, act on it, it's awful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, ah, what is your name again?  Bridget[?]?
R:  PJ.
L:  Oh.  What's your name?
R:  PJ.  
L:  Oh, PJ.  Oh, I'm sorry.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was, like, I couldn't hear it at first.
R:  Oh, that's okay.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I was sort of surprised.  I didn't know how they were going to, like, start it or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Well, it's interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  What school do you go to? 
R:  Penn State.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  How far is that from Philadelphia? 
R:  Um, I think it's about four hours.
L:  Four hours.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it really -- it's really big, isn't it? 
R:  What, Penn State?
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Or -- um, it's not that b- -- it's pretty big, but, I don't know, it's not -- it's not all that big.  I went to other schools and they are like hu- -- a lot bigger [LAUGH] but ... I've never been to Philadelphia, though.  That seems like a huge city [LAUGH] compared to anything around here. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't -- to me it's kind of sma- --
