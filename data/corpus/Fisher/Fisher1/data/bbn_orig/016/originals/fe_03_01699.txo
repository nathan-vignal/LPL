L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm fine.  My name's Portia.
R:  I'm Markie.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Well, what do you think?
L:  Well, I think that, ah, some people think that the United States shouldn't have go- gotten involved, but I think that we may be the only country who can take care of things and help people out, and we're a better country -- um, as far as democracies, at least at -- we tend to be, and if, just like if somebody needed help here, we would tr- we should try to help them out.
R:  Right.  I would agree with you on that.  Yeah, definitely.  I, ah, I'm like you.  I think we're the ones who have the, the power, I guess, and it seemed to me, like, we were using it responsibly by, you know, going in -- I guess we view it as Americans as a rescue [LAUGH] or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, I don't know.
L:  And I know -- I don't know, it -- it seems, like, um -- it makes me feel good to see the people over there rejoicing and feeling better.  I mean, not everybody is, but the majority of the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- citizens are.  And they seem happy, so I mean, if, if we're making -- if we're helping to make their lives better, then I'd think -- I mean, if anything, that's some good, you know?
R:  Yeah, for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't know if there'll ever be peace over there, though.
L:  No, I don't know either.
R:  That's just -- I just --
L:  It may take a long time before that happens. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, for sure.  I just -- oh, it goes so far back, and, ah, just -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- thousands of years.
L:  I know.
R:  And, ah, --
L:  So, of course, um, -- ah, somebody that my husband works with said that, "They didn't know if we did the right thing because they haven't -- they supposedly haven't found any weapons of mass destruction yet" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, and both my husband and I were like, "Well -- but if, if we help their lives be better, then, you know, at least we did something".
R:  Exactly.
L:  But --
R:  Well, we stopped all the, ah, I guess, you know, all the torturing and everything.  I think --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that was the thing that just --
L:  Exactly.  We got a tyrant leader out of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- out of leadership.
R:  And, ah, --
L:  And who -- I mean, we haven't even hardly even touched the search on the weapons anyway.
R:  Oh, right. [inaudible]
L:  There's all sorts of hidden little places, and --
R:  You know, I think it's gonna have to be people there telling us where it is.  I mean, it'll be, like, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- looking for a needle in a haystack, you know.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, they'd have -- 'cause there's all sorts of underground things, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, so I mean, you'd have to know where it is, otherwise you're gonna tear up the whole land -- 
R:  Right.  I think --
L:  -- looking for them.
R:  -- the only thing that has bothered me so far is all those cluster bombs that they -- that we used.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I wish that somehow we could go clean those up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So so many of the little kids wouldn't get hurt.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  But, ah, maybe they will address that at some point.
L:  I'm sure they will.
R:  Yeah.  So, where are you from?
L:  I live in Oklahoma.
R:  Oh, neat.  I'm Tennessee.
L:  Where do you live -- Tennessee?
R:  Yeah.  Everybody else has been from the north, so it's been nice to get -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- somebody that's -- it's like, "Ew, you talk funny", you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, --
L:  No, you sound fine to me. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you do to me too.  It's like, "Oh, this is nice", you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  I know it.  Oh.
L:  So, we're just supposed to keep talking until they tell us to stop? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It'll beep or something.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, um, -- okay, what else?  Okay, what do you think about Israel, 'cause that's probably something they're interested in.
L:  Well, like, what do you mean about that?
R:  Like, ah, the Israel and all the Arab nations about peace with that, 'cause a lot of the Arab countries think that this is trying to weaken their position against Israel, that the US is coming in to back up Israel and all.  Um, --
L:  Well --
R:  I don't really think this had anything to do with it.  I may be naive, but, ah, I think Israel's a separate issue --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think they keep trying to bring it in, but --
L:  Well, everyone likes to tie everything to something else.
R:  Oh, ain't that the truth.  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean, [LAUGH] --
R:  I think they're both pigheaded myself. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it's like, "Can't you all just work together", yeah.  Of course --
L:  No.
R:  -- I feel that way about Republicans and Democrats, so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, I know.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's kind of crazy.
R:  It is.
L:  And all the -- the, um, the, um, actors and actresses.
R:  Oh.
L:  They're about to drive me crazy.
R:  Ain't it the truth.
L:  It's ridiculous.
R:  I know it.
L:  And --
R:  I --
L:  -- it --
R:  -- you know, they have such unreal lives, you know, I just [SIGH] --
L:  They -- it's -- I don't know.  They're -- and, and I don't think that they're -- they should -- it's not their place to talk about it, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  I mean, they can talk about it in their own personal lives, but not getting everybody --
R:  Not to use that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their fame or whatever as a, I don't know, trying to influence everybody.
L:  The thing is that, ah, um, they don't seem to realize -- well, a lot of them are surprised that the general public -- the majority of the general public are not agreeing with them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because -- yeah, and 'cause they expected everyone to be like, "Oh, well yeah", but instead, well the majority of the general public are saying, "What is wrong with you?", you know, and they don't -- they're not get- they don't understand why.
R:  I know.
L:  And, um, I just think that's kinda funny.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they think -- they're so used to being made stars of that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know [LAUGH] I guess they expect everybody to think like they do too.  I don't know.  It's ...
L:  But I don't think it's very smart.  I know that if I was an entertainer that relied on the public's view of me, I would not take sides on anything in as, as far as [NOISE] voicing my opinions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because you alienate so many people when you do that.
R:  Well, that's true.  But then you can't just not stand for anything.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think there's a time and a place for it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  I mean, I don't know, I think that there's just, um, -- I don't know.  It just seems, like, I would wanna -- so many of them are always saying that they want to keep their personal lives personal --
R:  Oh, yeah right. [LAUGH]
L:  But then, but then their personal opinions, they want to tell everyone else to feel that way.
R:  That's exactly right.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I mean --
R:  Like, --
L:  -- you can't have both sides.
R:  I like that --
L:  Pick one or the other.
R:  -- yeah, I hadn't thought about that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Really.  That's the truth.
L:  So --
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'll be glad when we get a lot of aid into Iraq, you know, be able to get them fed and everything.  I think that will help a lot, when we can get that taken care of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- and settled.
L:  It was -- um, I did like, um, -- I know some people didn't like a lot of the stuff being, um, being able to see the stuff on TV --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I liked being able to see exactly what goes on in a war.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  I loved that.
L:  Um, 'cause my i- my idea of it was -- of course it's a different kind of war --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it -- there weren't -- there were not as many casualties of war as, um, in other wars.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, I think it was very planned out.  I -- planned well as far as r- keeping that from happening.
R:  Right.
L:  But at the same time, you know, my idea, and, you know, when you think about war you have a picture in your head of what that's like, and it -- all sorts of -- you're -- from education, from learning about wars and all this kind of stuff, 'cause you never -- and -- or the depiction of it on movies and stuff.
R:  TV, right.
