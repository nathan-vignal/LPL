L:  [NOISE] Hi, my name is Linda.
R:  Hi, I'm Sarah.
L:  Hi.
R:  How're you?
L:  Good, good.  It's been a while since I did one of these. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, oh, I don't know.  Um, I think --
R:  Yeah, it's a pretty -- pretty, ah, heavy topic. [LAUGH]
L:  I [LAUGH] know.  Usually they're easier.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  I think yes, um, we need to stay involved --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- now that we're in there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We need to help them rebuild, um, and get bac- get their lives back together.
R:  Right, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Um, [MN] I don't know how I feel about going in.
R:  Right.
L:  I certainly feel bad about --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all our poor boys that have died.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  And girls, right. [MN]
L:  Yes, right.  Ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I -- I don't know.  This -- this one's tough.  Ah --
R:  It is really tough.  I mean, I -- I feel like I -- I really don't know e- enough about anything that goes on over there.  Ah, I just, you know, I mean, I don't think I -- I don't think I read enough about it.  But, um, [MN] you know, it just -- it's -- it's just such a different world and it's, ah, it's hard to know what ex- what exactly you can do, you know?
L:  I know.
R:  An- and what's gonna happen.  Ah, you know, I mean, right now it seems like a big mess and, um, you know, [MN] there's so many different ethnic groups and religious groups and, I mean, h- how do you, ah, set up a government now in this -- in this, ah -- entering all this turmoil?  So ...
L:  I know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I know.  I think that's why, ah, ah, those nations always have such a hard time is because their beliefs are so different.
R:  Right.
L:  And um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- this -- this -- I think this is why they're always fighting over there.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I also agree.  I -- I pay some attention and I do some reading --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on it but, um, my husband probably knows a lot more than I do.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I was against going in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I -- I wanted t- to wait for the UN to give the okay.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I just think it would have been better to have everybody back us.
R:  Yeah.  I fe- I feel like it's sort of a -- it only solidifies the -- the rest of the world's feelings about us, you know, in -- in that we're sort of [NOISE] bullies and, you know, just going in and doing whatever we want anyway, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, just why did -- why even bother asking if you're gonna go do it anyway, sort of thing.
L:  Ah, I agree.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  I agree.  And I certainly feel bad for all the families that have lost their -- their sons and daughters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, all the poor families that are doing without because their -- their husbands and wives are other there.
R:  Right, yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.  But -- and I feel bad for all the poor people over there that got killed.
R:  Right.
L:  So many innocent people got hurt.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  And I wish there was a better way we could have done this but --
R:  Yeah.  And, I mean, there's still -- a- an- and it doesn't seem like any- anything has really been accomplished.  I mean, wh- what's re- -- you know, they -- they really haven't, like, captured Saddam for one.  I mean, obviously it seems like his regime has been taken down but -- but there's no clear, ah, person or group that can step up and clearly take the place and -- and not be a dictator or, um, you know.  Or -- or not be, ah, prejudiced against someone.
L:  Right.
R:  So it's sort of -- it's sort of scary wha- what happens next.  And, I mean, all these people -- I was listening to the radio today and they said, um, you know, things do seem to be getting back, well, not to normal but getting back to the way they were, and people are lined up at gas stations and people are going to the market.  But -- but then still at night they all go inside and lock their doors because of all the looting that's still taking place.
L:  Right.
R:  So ... [MN]
L:  Right, yeah.  Yeah, I -- I [LAUGH] -- I know.  Um --
R:  So, I mean, yeah, I guess it definitely seems like somebody needs to stay there and sort of try and help sort things out.  But [MN] how --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- how long can you stay, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  I -- well, there -- the -- I -- I think they were -- when did they say, like five years --
R:  Oh, jeez.
L:  -- it's gonna take to rebuild.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, I think we need, um -- they need to set up as soon as possible a form of government that can take over the, you know, the -- the police force and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, start to get back, you know, their own lives and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- govern their own lives.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, um, it's gonna take a long time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's hard 'cause, I mean, like, we don't really understand their -- their traditions, their culture, you know.  So, w- w- what -- what do they want, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, yeah.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Um, I think they plan on putting, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what's his name?  Ah, the one that -- that was exiled to England.  Um --
R:  Oh, I can't remember his name.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know who you're talking about.
L:  They're gonna put him -- they're gonna -- I think they were gonna put him in and he's gonna do basically what the US want him to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that hope- hopefully that'll work for a while until these people can understand what democracy's all about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause they don't even have a clue.
R:  Right.  I mean, how could they?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And hopefully he's been in England long enough to, um, to realize he's got to treat these people right.
R:  Right.
L:  He's got to be fair.
R:  [MN] Yeah, we can -- we can hope.  I mean, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it just seems like, oh, can you just keep going in and -- and taking out all these, you know, all these, ah, people you don't like, you know, and ...
L:  I know.  An- and that doesn't work because we don't even know if any of 'em are dead.
R:  Right.
L:  Bin Laden's still alive.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Ah, the Atti- Ayatollah, you know, we never got at him. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  So, I do- I don't know.  And like, ah, Saddam, who knows?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, he's got so many look-alikes who knows if he's alive. [LAUGH]
R:  I know that's [LAUGH] -- that's the thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I love that.  A- a- all these people have had plastic surgery so they can look like him.
L:  I know.  They gotta be desperate.
R:  I think that's crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  And y- you hear so many conflicting things.  Like, I mean, you h- you see things on the news where all the people are rejoicing and saying, "We love Bush".  And then -- and then other people say, "Well, we don't -- we didn't want you here in the first place" and [inaudible].
L:  I think they say, "We love Bush" only because, um, [MN] the marines are handing out, ah, pictures of Bush and everything.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know.  A- and I think they're just saying --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that for now.  I don't think any of 'em mean it. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no. [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  And they're just happy to get rid of Saddam.
R:  Yeah, that's exactly it, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But, ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  [LIPSMACK] I d- I -- I don't know.  Ah, they -- they seem to prey on their own, you know, with all the looters and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You just don't know -- like you say, you don't know how they think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For their cultures are way, way different.
R:  And I g- I guess as a soldier you just have to really, you know, believe that you're -- you're helping, you know, and y- you could possibly die but it's gonna help these people, you know.  And [MN] I can't im-
L:  But they --
R:  I can't imagine being in the military and, ah, going over there and not, you know, believing it, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  [MN]
L:  I know.  And I think they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, yeah.  Um, I hope they do.
R:  I know. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so ...  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.
R:  [MN] So --
L:  It's a tough one.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  [MN] And then, I mean, [MN] well, I -- I love what happened when, ah, you know, when -- when [MN] you know, France and Germany and the other countries wouldn't, you know, wouldn't back it right away, um, [MN] then all of a sudden they're our enemies too, you know?  [LAUGH] And so [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's pretty ridiculous but ...
L:  I think they were saying not too long ago on the news that France is really trying now to be our buddies.
R:  Right.
L:  They're -- they're going overboard --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to be nice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, but, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't think they've ever liked the Americans.
R:  Yeah, well, that's not true. [LAUGH]
L:  No?
R:  'Cause, I mean, I lived there for a little while and I was, ah, you know, I was, ah, pretty famous in the town I was in because I was the one American and they loved me, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Well, that's good to know.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I think that -- that that's one of the problems, is that, you know, you have these stereotypes of all these different countries and [MN] so immediately when somebody, y- you know, says no to the US, they're gonna all of a sudden -- ah, I mean, I think it's definitely true that they still want to be, you know, a world power and they aren't but [MN] -- an- and pretty much nobody is but, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  Except for us, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Um, so it's -- it's kinda hard, I guess, to stand up to the US and then -- yeah, and then after -- after all this happens, what can you do?
L:  Right.
R:  So ... [MN]
L:  And England.  They're pretty strong too in, um --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they've got us and England.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um --
R:  I mean, I can -- I can understand not wanting to send in any of your, ah -- your people to fight, you know, and  [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- possibly get killed if everyone's not behind it.  And, I mean, [MN] you know, everyone was not behind it here so --
L:  No, no.
R:  It's very, very divided so ...
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, I -- I don't -- yeah, I -- I wasn't for it but, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know any other way they could have done it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, if they wanted for the UN wh- who knows how long they --
R:  Right, how --
L:  -- would've taken.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  There's no good answer on that one.
R:  No. [MN]
L:  No, not really.
R:  And, so, I mean, yeah.  So any of these soldiers who have gone over there, will they be there for a long time or ...? [MN]
L:  Ah, I think that, ah, [MN] they- they'll probably, you know, do tours of so long --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I would think.  How else could you do it?
R:  Yeah.  I can't im- I can't imagine, yeah.
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  They could- they couldn't stay there for -- for years. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I think -- I think it's like, [MN] um -- I know when my brother was in the army he did --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a three year tour over in Germany.  But I don't think they -- I -- I think that's way too long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  That would be. [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I think -- I think, you know, um, it would be nice if they could do, like, six months, you know, it
