R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Lance.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I'm Nana[?].  How are you, Lance?
L:  Okay.
R:  Good.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I guess let's get this conversation started.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  This is so weird.
L:  That enough?
R:  Yeah, um, I guess as far as what's going on in the Middle East, from day one I've been extremely opposed to it.  Um, [LIPSMACK] it's actually kind of confusing to me as to exactly what Bush was intending, you know, to do in the Middle East, if it's as far as overthrowing Saddam.  I personally just felt as though that's something that the people of Iraq should have, you know, taken into their own hands, if they felt as though he needed to be overthrown, that's something they should have dealt with.  I don't think we should have moved in, you know, into the country to overthrow their leader, um --
L:  Okay, okay.  Uh, I didn't take the question that way at all.  Uh, Iraq and Iran are not considered the Middle East by my reckoning of geopolitics, uh, the -- by the Middle East they're referring to, uh, uh, the Palestinian, uh, Israeli conflict.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry, I'm --
L:  In -- in -- in my understanding.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, from my understanding I thought we were --
L:  Now, of course, they don't give us any guidance --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I can't say one way or the other.
R:  Yeah, I guess, um --
L:  Uh, my inclination, w- w- when people refer to the unrest in the Middle East, that's not referring, I don't think, to, uh, Iraq and, uh, the, uh, ongoing conflict there [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, my inclination is, uh, that it's -- that -- that it's the other thing, th- th- that w- when they refer to growing unrest, that's what I -- or continuing unrest, rather, uh, that's the way that I took that one.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well --
L:  So, um, the a- I don't care which side you want -- w- w- which segment you want to continue on, if you want to continue i- in your interpretation or, uh, work with mine, that's -- that's -- the -- I can go either way.
R:  Oh, okay, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess I'm more well versed in what's go- -- I see -- well, Iraq and -- Iraq is, um, part of the Middle East.
L:  Um, well, [SIGH] n- not exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, maybe you know [LAUGH] more about this than I do.  I just --
L:  Yeah, it -- it's -- it's -- it's -- it's -- it's actually considered central Asia, um, a- or Persia --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- uh, which, uh, predates a lot of the other stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  By quite a bit, so, um -- and anyway, if you -- if you want to talk on that one and stuff, uh, you know, I -- I have tended to be a pacifist for thirty plus years.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mm.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, not so much, uh, um, based -- not -- not so much basing it on any kind of philosophical issues, but just, uh, practicality, uh, and, uh, granted, part of that may be the fact that I grew up during the Vietnam era.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, and I thought it was a horrendous waste.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But at that point, it was recognized as a waste as opposed to, uh, ten years before that, when it was recognized as, uh, a, "Them or us" and that was the only way to survive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was to -- w- was to eliminate the, uh, the -- the communist menace, so to speak.  Um, you know, in this particular case, my own personal gut feel for it was, "Why did they waste all that time and resources and materials?".  All it would have taken was a single, uh, presidential finding, uh, by W. to, uh, say, "Okay, fine.  We're going to ignore what previous administrations have considered --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- illegal --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- and just send in, uh, s- send in some assassination squads --"
R:  Exactly.
L:  "-- and take care of it, nip it at the top".  Uh, but, you know, my -- my own gut feel on this is that, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- we have a little boy there who loves to play with his big toys.
R:  Yeah, that's [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's exactly what it boils down to.
L:  Uh, and had a personal, uh, vendetta.
R:  Vendetta, exactly.
L:  Uh, so, you know, and -- and that really wasn't appropriate for foreign policy, but then again, from the outset, we didn't expect anything, [SIGH] uh, of any great intelligence from the foreign policy that was going to be put into place by that administration, so -- uh, not that previous administrations for the past several, uh, oh, decades, had really had an intelligent foreign policy.  Everything for years and years and years has been, "We the greatest -- "
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- uh, and we will impose our will" and at the same time, claim opposition to anybody else who's doing something so bad as to impose their own will.  Um, so [LAUGH] it's, like, I'm just glad that right now I'm too old and my kids are too young [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  -- to be -- to be physically drawn into that.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  I guess, um, for me it's more -- it's almost even a -- a personal issue, because I was affected personally through both, uh, [NOISE] the first Persian Gulf War and now, the unrest that's happening now, because I use- I grew up in Kuwait actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, as a result of the first war of father Bush, I wound up coming to America --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and my Dad currently still resides in Kuwait even as we speak.  So 
L:  Your English is very good.
R:  [LAUGH] thank you.
L:  [LAUGH] There's --
R:  Well, my -- my parents are Nigerian actually.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Um --
L:  Oh, well [LAUGH] --
R:  So Ibo was my first language --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, your -- your -- your -- your -- your --
R:  -- and then English my second.
L:  -- your English accent is, uh, remarkably American.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It i- -- it is.  It's --
L:  [LAUGH] You've done quite well in that regard --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you're probably throwing the linguistics study off -- off the [LAUGH] --
R:  I know, [LAUGH] I'm sure I am.
L:  [LAUGH] That's not our problem though.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so, um, it's even more so a personal thing to me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't understand it the first time, I still don't understand it this time as to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, why this is going on.  It's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just crazy, I mean, millions -- not millions, but so many people are -- so many civilians are getting hurt over there.  So, I mean, when you turn on the news, you constantly see, you know, innocent children, mothers, men, families being torn apart, being hurt, being wounded over, as you said, Bush being a child, being a boy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- playing with these toys, you know --
L:   Well, it's a --
R:  -- trying to avenge --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whatever between his father and Saddam.
L:  Right, so, um, you know, a lot -- a lot of this, uh, you know, this game, h- h- having -- having had US military in the family for all generations prior --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to mine, uh, I -- I do think I understand a little bit about the -- the military outlook on the things as well, and, uh, [SIGH] to some extent  a lot of the stuff that we see media wise is so orchestrated.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Um, and, you know, a- a- and all parties are orchestrating, uh, you know, and both sides are providing propaganda in the extreme.  Um, I do have my doubts as to the extreme level of civilian casualties, uh, primarily because an awful lot of regular forces on the, uh -- on the opposing side, uh, quickly doffed their uniforms, uh, you know, they're not following the, [LIPSMACK] oh, the accepted procedures.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, such that an awful lot of the civilian personnel that are crying in the hospitals are not necessarily civilian personnel, certainly the adult males, the vast majority are not civilians.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, the -- the others, that's, in a lot of respects, that's because of the -- one, th- the methods that are used by the opposition, uh, you know, the, uh, if you look back at some of the, uh, some of the coverage that was provided of -- of the prior, uh, conflict with, uh, um, European citizens who did not get out soon enough --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- being play -- being used as human shields, uh, of course there's none of those any more, so what else has he got to use but his own people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as -- as shields, and you know, uh, you know, vast efforts were obvious to me that there's a lot of things they could have done that would have been a whole lot worse, but they pulled the punches, so to speak.  Um, but, uh, I still think that the best way to do it would have been to use as high tech as possible and uh, um, you know, a couple of -- a couple more of the -- of the delta force type of folks would have taken care of a lot.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, now I'm simply waiting to see whether or not all the, uh, all the, uh, things that they swear they were going after --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- uh, if those are going to ever materialize.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, in a lot of cases, a -- a lot of this has to do with, uh -- the -- the American culture seems to think that it can push a button and solve a problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, we know that that is not the way --
R:  That's not the case, that's not --
L:  It's not -- y- y- you cannot solve that, uh, if -- i- if someone -- b- basically I'm going to wish hard enough and solve it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, if wishes could solve things, if wishes could solve things and stuff, there'd be a whole lot of other things that were solved.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A whole lot of other problems that are solved, so 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anyhow ...  So [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH]  Let's see --
L:  I'll le- I'll -- I'll let you proceed for a while.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, as you said, um, as you started to mention, you're curious just to see what's going to become of all of this, um, I feel the exact same way.  Now you turn on the news and it's constant talk about, "Saddam is dead.  Is he alive, is he --", you know, what -- so what hap-
