L:  Hi, my name is Charlotte.
R:  H- Hi, I'm Nakil[?].
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good thanks.
L:  Um, I understand that the topic is the Middle East.
R:  That's right.
L:  Um, are -- do you -- where do you live in the country?
R:  I'm in Columbus, Ohio.
L:  Okay.  That's where my fa- -- that's where my husband's from -- up in that area.  I live in Florida.
R:  I see.
L:  Um, well, I'm -- I'm kind of, uh, mixed on this issue a little bit, um, um, I -- I didn't -- I don't know if I -- if I agree with the whole issue or not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that some intervention was necessary to help the people there.
R:  Mhm [MN].
L:  Um, what do you -- how do you feel about that part of it?
R:  Well, uh, how I feel about the whole issue is, uh, terribly sad, obviously.
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  Um, there is, uh, no other way to react to it as, uh, [several inaudible words] new civilization that we are in America, because the guys who are fighting there are obviously [SIGH] ancient, uh, civilizations, right?
L:  Yes, very much.
R:  So, our local standards really on the matters are -- are, you know, is rather limited, uh, because we don't really think back as many centuries as they can.  But, uh, ironically that is -- seem to +exacerbate the problem rather than go towards solving it.
L:  Yeah, I s- -- I see that --
R:  But, um --
L:  -- especially they were -- the -- especially when the looting and everything and the destruction --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of all the property --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they were -- I hear- heard on the news they were talking about that.  This was just their way to unwind, or to, um, you know, they had been held repressed for so long.  But I'm really concerned, especially for the antiquities that were destroyed or that were --
R:  But are -- are you talking of Iraq or, uh, the Middle East?
L:  Well, [MN] I was talking about Iraq --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um, a little bit, um -- as far as the Middle East, are you talking about, um, say, Israel and wh- which --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anything in particular that you're referring to?
R:  Yeah, I was talking of, uh, [LAUGH] you know, the fact that Jerusalem is a holy city for these --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- three really old religions, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, uh, I think, uh, but that's something -- that's a fact that a lot of debates actually leave out, uh, the fact of the, you know, the oldness of these civilizations really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think they are [SIGH], uh, the very fact that they are so old should be a -- a reason for them to be more wise in resolving these kinds of conflicts --
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I would -- I would imagine a country like America, for example, if we were directly involved in a conflict like this, uh, would tend to prolong[?] for, uh, you know, long because we don't have a -- a base really to operate from, whereas these guys do.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, unless it's actually working against, uh, for each of them really on the ground, so that's what I expect.  I -- I think that's a very important, uh, uh, point in, you know, in diplomacy in that region really.  We have to consider that these people come from very, uh, deep rooted traditions of, uh, religious part.
L:  Yes.  I was married to a -- to a Muslim.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes, I was, but -- when I was very young, so I know -- I know a little bit about --
R:  What do you mean, when you very young [LAUGH].
L:  Well, when I was in my twenties.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.
L:  Um, when I was in my early twenties I was married to a Muslim for a short time.  He was from Libya.
R:  I see.
L:  So, I -- so, I do -- I do know about, you know, about the faith and everything and -- but I -- I think that, um, as far as we're talking about Middle East and Jerusalem and everything.  Uh, it's sort of, uh, a double edged sword because we have to sort of be there to protect, but I -- I'm not sure if we're helping or if we're hurting it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I think we're interfering in something that maybe we shouldn't be interfering in.  Maybe it has to run its course.  Maybe it has to work its way out.  I don't really, you know -- but the people that are there -- there's -- I mean, there's innocents too that are involved in it, but I don't believe that it's gonna stop.  I think it's just gonna go to its conclusion whatever that is --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I don't think there's -- I don't think there's too much that's gonna change that.
R:  That's right, uh, see personally a lot of people when I talk about, um, the Middle East, uh, I mean, I live in a University community so we have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- these kinds of discussions every now and then.  And they say, "Okay, what's your opinion?  Who do your sympathies lie with?"  And, uh, [SIGH], uh, you know, I [LAUGH] -- that's a hard question really because when both sides are dying you really can't sympathize with one at, uh [LAUGH], you know.
L:  Right.
R:  At, uh, you know, the expense of the other really.  So, but, but, uh, I mean, the real, uh, the first thing I answered to that question obviously that I sympathize with, uh, uh, the occupied people --
L:  Yes, right.
R:  -- obviously, I mean, isn't it?  I mean, they have had that land and -- for so many centuries before the, um, the, present day Israeli.  It's more than that and, uh -- my c- -- my -- I always wonder why it could not be a question of immigration.  I mean, why could not, uh, uh, current day Jews actually have immigrated and become citizens of, say, Palestine or, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wherever.  But, other than, you know -- just as America, for example.
L:  Well, there's a lot of people in America that wanna go back.
R:  Right, well, but the folks who came here are now Americans, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, they are Jewish Americans.  When why could not, uh, people who went there be, uh, Jewish Palestinians and, uh, have immi- -- uh, apply for immigration.  I mean, why could not immigration be a -- a policy that the United Nations [inaudible] rather than, uh, allowing America to recognize Israel and then perpetuating the invasion in, um, you know, history.
L:  Right, I agree.  I agree with that.
R:  Uh, I --
L:  I think that's, um --
R:  I think that could be a possible solution to, uh, you know, this, uh -- I mean, it's never too late to go back to these, um, kind of, you know, possible solutions [LAUGH] really.  [several inaudible words]  But I don't know what you would say about that.
L:  Well, I -- I think -- I think that might be, um -- that might be a good solution to try,  um -- certainly what's happened right now hasn't -- hasn't worked.  It's not working.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and as far as I -- I -- I'm a -- I kind of -- I mean, obviously I'm American citizen.  I've been born and raised here, but I also think that -- that sometimes America tends to get too much into other people's and other countries' business.  
R:  [NOISE] Mhm [SIGH].
L:  I r- really think they do.  Um, even as far as this thing with, um, you know, with Iraq, um, I -- I mean that's sort of a mixed subject with me too.  I know -- I knew that something was needed, but I'm not sure that we de- -- that our President chose it for the right reason at this time and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm concerned -- I mean, I have two children that live in the household with me and they're both teenagers.  My younger one is very disturbed about all this.
R:  I see.
L:  She's very disturbed about -- about all the innocents that died.  She doesn't understand, um -- even just things like car bombings or something like that.  She just doesn't ...  She's like, "But they shouldn't do it anyway.  It doesn't matter".  And, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm trying to explain to her, you know, and I can't and it's kinda hard for me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to explain to her because I don't -- you know, like I told her I said -- she goes, "Well, if you don't know, then how am I supposed to know?"  And I'm like, "You know, you're -- that's -- that's entirely correct but I -- I'm not gonna tell you that I understand it if I don't".  I mean it's -- and I'm not -- and I told her, I said, "A lot of that is political.  It's politically, um, done".
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, you know, what are you gonna do?  I mean, they're -- everyone -- we're not in control of those things, you know --
R:  Indeed.
L:  -- I told her.  I said, "You know, we're not.  We can vote for who we wanna vote and we can do these things, but as far as -- I -- I don't really think that, um --"
R:  W- W- What is your view of, uh, the perceived, uh, economic, uh, power of the Jewish community in America?  Do you think they are really so powerful, financially, that they control --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- these major policy decisions?
L:  Mm, um, to a point, yeah, in certain areas, yes.  I -- I don't think, um -- I don't think it's -- I think that they -- I think they're very smart business people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay?  And I don't really think that -- I don't think that, you know, that they're -- that they're -- I mean, like I said, I live in a smaller town in a s- -- in a suburb in Florida --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Central Florida.  So, I'm not really into a b- -- they don't have a big Jewish community here, so I don't see a lot of -- a lot of the business.  A lot of it is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- probably more behind the scenes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that I don't know about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Although I did work for a Jewish gentlemen up until recently.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my op- -- I mean, my opinion of him is not very good because --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- he doesn't -- I mean, well, he believes in making money at any cost.  He doesn't care who --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he hurts to do it.
R:  [LAUGH] It's like --
L:  Who he takes advantage of, who he lies to.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Who he does out of money, and I finally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- decided I couldn't work for him any more just because of that fact.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He's a multimillionaire b- -- and being a multimillionaire you'd think that he wouldn't even need to be involved, you know, anywhere in the business as far as being around it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  but he's not.  He can't stay away from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it sort of drives everybody a little bit nuts.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, because he's just -- he doesn't have any m- -- he -- he has no morals as far as what -- what he will do in order to be successful in his business and he -- that was my first, um, real -- having any real experience with, you know, anyone that I really worked with that closely.  I mean, like I said, I've been -- I've been behind, um, you know, I've been behind the scenes --
R:  I see.
L:  You know, where I -- where I know that people have owned these businesses but I didn't have contact with them.  Um, but having contact I would -- you know, I -- I -- I had a real bad, you know, real bad thing from him, you know, I didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I didn't care for his business practices and, uh, not to say that -- that's all the Jewish community, it certainly isn't --
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.
L:  -- but it gave me a bad f- -- you know, g- kinda gave me kind of a bad -- a bad image.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so, um [MN]...  I mean, I think they're very industrious people.  I think if they came over here after, you know, being -- you know, coming over after the w- -- you know after the war and everything and I think they've set their families up and I think -- I commend them for their hard work.
R:  Right.
L:  I think they work very hard --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in a lot of places.  But, like I said, I -- as far as me knowing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, what this, you know, what this would do as far as a large community, I don't know.  What do you think about that?  How -- what do you ...
