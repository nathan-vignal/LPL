L:  How're you doing?  My name is Carlton Ingram.
R:  Hi, this is Margaret.
L:  [PAUSE] Hello?
R:  Hello, can you hear me?
L:  Oh, so how do feel about the Middle East?
R:  Oh, I think we're doing the right thing. [NOISE]
L:  [MN] See me, I'm -- I'm, like, totally against it.
R:  I'm -- I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
L:  [MN] I said I'm totally against it.
R:  Why? [LAUGH]
L:  Because I [MN] -- I -- I think that it goes back in to, like, back in the day where people just tried to destroy and conquer [MN] and I think that's pretty much --
R:  Yeah, but we have to work -- you have to work for freedom also.
L:  I think -- I mean, that's -- that's true in a sense but [MN] it's still a lot --
R:  If our --
L:  -- lives are going to be lost.
R:  If our grandfathers and great grandfathers didn't fight for us we wouldn't have freedom right now.
L:  But you got to look at what type of --
R:  Well, it ta- -- it takes --
L:  -- freedom you're talking about.
R:  It takes a loss of life to get what you need sometimes and we can't take the chance of having terrorists in our country.
L:  [MN] But I -- I don't think that you go out and just bomb a country becau- -- out of fear.  And I think that's what we did.  Like, we had, like, nothing --
R:  Yeah, but they have --
L:  -- was substantiated.
R:  They have, ah, weapons of mass destruction.
L:  They haven't been able to prove they have weapons of mass destruction.  They're still searching areas for the, um, weapons.  Last I checked they -- they found pesticide and thought it was chemical weapons.
R:  No, they found some, um, two days ago.
L:  Where was this at?
R:  Ah, somewhere in Iraq.
L:  See, I haven't heard anything about that and I watch the news --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- basically every day.
R:  Yeah, so do I.  [PAUSE] We have to fight for freedom for other people too.  You're not going to get it unless to fight for it.
L:  I think that a lot of -- I think that's v- very hypocritical for our nation to do, simply because there's so money countries that we are allies with that do a lot of the same things that Iraq does as far as torturing their own -- their own people.  I mean, like, South Korea.  They -- they torture their own people.  You've got China, they torture their own people.  But for some reason we're singl- singling out Iraq.  And I think --
R:  Yeah, but Iraq is worse than any other country.
L:  You can't really sa- -- you really don't know how bad Iraq is.
R:  Well, [several inaudible words].
L:  You what?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.
L:  I -- I can't hear what you said.
R:  [NOISE] I -- [NOISE] uh, I said Iraq is worse than any country around here.
L:  I mean, I don't -- I don't really see how, like, we can say anyone is wor- -- like, if someone kills someone and tortures them, I don't see how you can put --
R:  Yeah, but they do it for --
L:  -- more into that --
R:  They do it for no means at all though.  Their country is known for that.
L:  I mean, I think, like, their -- their justice system is different than ours.  Like --
R:  They don't have any.  You have a bunch of guys that are doing what they want and having all the money in the country while their other people are starving.
L:  But, I mean, we have people over here that are starving as well.
R:  Yeah, but we're not torturing our people for looking at us in different wa- -- wrong ways [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as they have over there.
L:  [PAUSE] I don't know.  I mean, I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't think this -- this is right.  'Cause I don't think that, I mean --
R:  Do you like your religious freedom?
L:  Am I what?
R:  Do you like your religious freedom that you have here?
L:  I mean, yeah.
R:  Well, they don't have --
L:  But I think they have --
R:  They don't have that choice there.
L:  But I think we've taken it too far.  I mean, when you hear George Bush say that this war is in the name of God --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And that's basically what he said.  God came to him and said that this war was the right thing to do.
R:  We got to turn that down. [NOISE]
L:  I think that --
R:   Go ahead, I'm listening.
L:  I mean, I think that when you put it into those terms then you're not doing anything different than what Saddam Hussein would be doing.  If he's ruling the country based on his religious beliefs and then you have George Bush say that God came to him and said that this is the right thing to do --
R:  See, I didn't hear -- I -- I never heard that part. [MN]
L:  It's on --
R:  I've never heard that.
L:  It's on a, um, what is it?  It's either US News or Time and you -- you see George Bush on the front and it says, "Bush and God".  And if you read the article it gives you some of the, um, some of the quotes as far as him saying, like, about the story behind what I'm talking to you about.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  I -- I never heard that part though.
L:  Yeah, check it out.  I mean, it's interesting to read.
R:  Yeah, it would be, it would be.  I -- I totally agree with you on that.
L:  I mean, like I said -- like I'm-- like, I believe in, like, the freedom of speech and everything like that so, I mean, I respect your opinion.  But at the same time I don't feel like us going to Iraq is really going to solve a lot of their problems.  Because, I mean, if you just look at it from what's happened in the last couple of weeks, we've taken away the stability of their country.  So wh- --
R:  And they'll get it back twice and strong as it ever was.
L:  But, I mean, when you se- --
R:  We- we'll rebuild their country like it's never been before.  Ou- our people here will suffer because money will go to them to rebuild.
L:  And I -- I mean, I -- that's w- --
R:  Did you see their hospitals?
L:  I don't think that's right either, like.  Yeah, I mean, like --
R:  Have you -- have you -- have you seen their hospitals?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're -- they're not -- I wouldn't put my dog in their hospitals.  They're so dirty.  You think it's going to be like that in a couple of years after we get in there?  There's no way in hell.  It'll be like ours.
L:  I don't think it'll be like -- I don't think it'd be like America.
R:  Yes, it will.
L:  I don't --
R:  It'll be much better than what it is now.
L:  And I think that [MN] if we're giving them a lot -- like, a lot of stimulus packages, I mean, that's just going to [MN] bring our debt even further into the whole -- like since -- since George Bush has been in the Presidency [NOISE] the debt has just -- just keeps amounting.  And I don't think that with him as President it's ever going to [NOISE] be back to the plus.  But I guess that's a --
R:  I don't -- I -- I like him.  I --
L:  -- totally different issue.
R:  I like him.  I think he did the right thing.  The only thing I disagree with is telling them step by step when we were going to attack instead of it being a surprise.  We should have went in there and bombed them the day after September eleventh.
L:  [NOISE] But the day after September eleventh, I mean, they still had nothing to do with it.  Like --
R:  Yeah, they most certainly did.
L:  Like, bombing Iraq when they had nothing to do with -- with September eleventh, that doesn't solve anything.  You -- you don't solve anything --
R:  I wo- -- I would've taken the whole -- I would've blown the whole place off the face of the earth.
L:  Well, what about the five million people that stay in Baghdad?
R:  That's -- that's the consequences.
L:  Consequences of what?  You're going to take --
R:  Of living where you live.
L:  Twenty peop- --
R:  They allow these -- they allow these --
L:  Listen to this.
R:  -- idiots to run the country over there.
L:  Well, listen to this.  [MN] You have -- you hear George Bush talking about, "We're going to kill the people that harbor terrorists".
R:  Right.
L:  The terrorists were living Florida for, like, a year before they actually committed the crime.
R:  Yeah, we should've known that, okay?  We should've known that they were here.  I [several inaudible words].
L:  But I'm saying, if we're going to go out and bomb Baghdad because they had terrorists living in their country, then why shouldn't we be bombing Washington DC if [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, we should've known where they were.
L:  -- they're living in our country?
R:  We should've known where those gentlemen were.
L:  [MN] That's true.  I know w- we should've --
R:  I mean, I -- we -- we should've known a lot more than, you know.
L:  But I -- like, for me I don't think that it's right to say to somebody, "We're going to bomb your country and basically kill you because we don't agree with the things you say".  I mean, [MN] Iraq didn't bomb us.  If they had people living in that country that had something to do with it, [MN] that's -- they really don't have any evidence, uh, to prove that.  But they do have evidence to prove that th- the members that were on the planes that killed many people during September eleventh did stay in the United States.
R:  Correct, they were.  They were here for a while.
L:  A long time.
R:  We taught -- well, we taught them how to fly the planes.
L:  They paid taxes here.  I mean, you know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They learned everything from here.
R:  And we taught them how the -- we taught them that.  We taught them how to fly those planes.  They went to school here and we showed them how to do it.
L:  I think that they should take every individual on a case by case basis instead of trying to lump everybody together.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But [MN] I don't know.  I just keep -- just keep watching the news.
R:  Yeah.  It's a shame though.  I mean, there's a lot of innocent loss of life there.  And we've killed more of our own guys with friendly fire than they killed our guys.
L:  Mhm.  [PAUSE] [MN] I mean, I'm just waiting to see when they're actually going to, like, have substantial proof [NOISE] to show that Saddam is actually dead.
R:  I don't think he is.
L:  I don't think he is either.
R:  Yeah, I don't think he is.  I think he got out.  He's not that stupid.
