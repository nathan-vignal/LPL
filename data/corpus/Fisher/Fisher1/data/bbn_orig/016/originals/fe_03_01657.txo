R:  Hi.  This is Francine from New York.
L:  Hi.  This is Jane in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  [LAUGH] We -- I've been talking to people from all over the country.
R:  Yeah.  You're way over on the other side of the world, [LAUGH] --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the country from us, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I guess our topic today is issues in the Middle East.
R:  Yes.  Well, certainly a -- a current and, um, important topic.
L:  Um, no doubt, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you have anyone that you know or any relatives that are serving over in the Middle East?
L:  Um, no, I do not.  Um, [LIPSMACK] we are in a military community here with the air force base and NORAD and -- 
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- um, we have Fort Carson army facility here also, but, um, I don't know anybody personally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but our community has been affected tremendously -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- through the kids in the school that have parents involved and so forth.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] -- but, ah, I guess I feel quite strongly that the United States did the right thing by going in there, um, to try to, um, [LIPSMACK] let the world know we don't put up with terrorism. [MN]
R:  Right, and to try and bring about peace even in a -- in -- in this way.  I'm no- -- I don't -- I don't like the idea of war, um, but there are some situations that just -- I mean they were given so many opportunities, um, Iraq was -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to come up with the weapons of mass destruction and -- and now it's not -- it -- it's even more than that and -- and in watching all the news it's -- it's [SIGH] almost impossible to keep current with everything because now we're looking at Syria because they were harboring some of the terrorists or aiding them and [LIPSMACK] and just -- so there's so much more work to be done in -- over there or in the Middle East, so I have a feeling that, um, although it looks as if they're, you know, putting in a -- a, er, interim government for Iraq, we've got so much more work to do and it just saddens me because we've got so many military men and women over there who, uh, will obviously be there for quite some time and I do have a friend, um, he was in our wedding as a matter of fact -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he was serving over in Kuwait, he's with the air force and he's with the refueling wing and he's over there and of course he has no idea when he'll be back.
L:  Yes.
R:  So it's -- it's very difficult for his family and -- and friends to, uh, to see all of this happening.
L:  Right.  I agree, and I do agree that war -- I mean, I don't think anybody is for war, but this seemed to be the only solution and, as you say, we gave them every opportunity to cooperate and we got nowhere.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I truly believe that Saddam Hussein was involved and has been for many years in the terrorism and probably had his connections with Mr Osama bin Laden --
R:  Mhm, probably.  Yes.
L:  -- in the September eleventh issues as well and, um, I -- I don't know how much longer we'll be there but I think we'll be there for a while yet -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I hope that the United States will [LIPSMACK] continue to monitor their, um, reaching for a democratic society.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I mean I don't feel it's our fault that they're looting their own facilities -- 
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and banks and things like that.  
R:  No.
L:  I mean, we cannot be responsible for that.
R:  No.
L:  And -- 
R:  And I don't feel like we've occupied their country.  I think that we went in and -- and we're helping and -- and [MN] the way that -- that some of the media and of course some people in the mid- middle East are looking at it is that we've occupied their country and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and almost as if, you know, they're going to become another state of ours.  Well, of course we don't [LAUGH] no way.
L:  We don't want 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  No way. [LAUGH] No way.
L:  We don't want 'em and I -- I don't see that twisted way of thinking either -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- but, you know, it's an excuse on their behalf -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not to have to 'fess up to their own mistakes and -- and that's the way evil works, you know.
R:  I just wish we would know, um, where Saddam Hussein is, if he's alive, if he's not.  Um, I mean we went into Afghanistan and did all kinds of searching for Osama bin Laden and -- and in my opinion looked a little foolish because we couldn't come up with one s- -- one man.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now it seems as if, uh, we're in the same boat with, uh, Saddam Hussein.  We don't know whether he's [MN] is out there any more.
L:  I think he's -- 
R:  Too bad.  I think it would put -- 
L:  -- still alive. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you?  
L:  Yes.
R:  Is that your opinion?  Yeah.  I mean, I think it would put a lot of things to rest if we knew one way or the other -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but unfortunately that's not the case right now.  I think that the -- the United States is always, for ever and ever going to play a major role in peace [MN] throughout the world.
L:  Well, I agree and we always have.  I mean, look how many countries we have aided in past situations and we've always been the forerunner to try to help people put things back together -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm just pleased with some of the countries that we have supported in the past and they are not supporting us in this issue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, we're fighting for not only the freedom of the United States, but the freedom of the world here, from terrorism.
R:  That's for sure.  What happened i- -- um, in New York city could have happened anywhere.
L:  Exactly, but they hit us because we were one of the leaders in the world and ... 
R:  Make the most impact, I think.
L:  Yes.  And while they certainly did and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, financially our country has taken a big dive.
R:  Sure.  We haven't rebounded yet.
L:  Oh, and I think it will be another couple of years before we come even close to -- to regaining some of that ground we lost.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I agree, I -- there was no other option but for us to go in there and I hope that we do stay there for a while to help them get back on their feet and I know that there are probably leaders there that we don't hear much about that are wanting to step forward and get the democracy going, where their people are not suppressed and can take a hand in running their country, you know? 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  We get a distorted view from the news. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like you say, one [MN]-- you know, one thing happens and then another thing happens and then you don't know which is true and which is not true and from what they said the day before, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, ... but I do think we will be there for a while yet.
R:  I do, too.  Um, although it was nice to see on the news tonight that some of the, um, local troops of our, um, air fueling wing did come home today.
L:  Oh, did they?
R:  Uh, yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't -- it was just a small number of maybe one plane load or bus load, it seemed -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- but at least some of them came home, so some things are wrapping up, although I have a feeling that, you know, it could -- they could be deployed again at any time -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, were anything else to come up, but, uh, ... 
L:  Well, I think there probably will, like you say with Syria -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they're harboring terrorists as well and, who knows, maybe that's where Saddam Hussein is hiding out, you know.  If he did escape, that's probably the place he would all -- he could go.
R:  Right.
L:  That's close by.
R:  It is pretty amazing all the things that -- that, uh, I guess I never considered before, like, um, the -- the questioning of all of the, um, or as many of the scientists that they could find and -- uh, about where they would -- if they would tell us where the -- the weapons or even the, um, [LIPSMACK] the, uh, parts to them, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the chemicals needed for them, where they're stashing them or where they were, um, producing them, so hopefully they can get some answers.  Um, --
L:  They will probably convince somebody to talk somewhere along the line.
R:  I think so.
L:  You know, if -- if they know that they may get some asylum or something like that and -- and them as well as their family, because I'm sure that's how Saddam --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- put it, you know -- 
R:  Yeah.  Just your own --
L:  -- "If you don't do what I tell you, I'm going to kill your kids".
R:  Right.
L:  And so they do what they can at the point in time, even though it may not be right, but their lives are in danger, their family's in danger and I can see why they did what they did.
R:  Sure.  Now, you said you've talked with other people tonight about the same subject?  
L:  Um, not tonight.
R:  Oh.
L:  I talked with people last week on the -- the nine eleven issue.
R:  Oh, yes, so did I.
L:  Um, but I haven't talked with anyone else today -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, regarding the current situation -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, I -- and I also -- I don't know, somehow no matter what the topic is it always keeps coming back to this current thing -- 
R:  Sure does.
L:  -- either nine eleven or the war, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's easy to get back -- get right to it, actually.  
L:  Ah.
R:  It affects everything we do.
L:  No -- yes, no doubt.  Um, I -- I just -- I feel bad for those that have lost their lives over there -- 
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- and -- and those that were held prisoner, you know.  They've been able to free them, um, but, [MN] I don't know, I still think Saddam is hiding out somewhere, I don't think that he's dead.  I wish he were dead and [LAUGH] -- and I think a lot of people wish he were dead.
R:  Yeah.  Ahah.
L:  Um, if he isn't dead, I hope maybe he's severely injured, I don't know, because --
