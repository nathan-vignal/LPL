L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Rochelle.
R:  Hi, this is Patty Moore.  I was not able to understand the topics, uh, clearly, uh.
L:  It's basically like, how do you feel, like -- well, what are your thoughts on, um, the current situation in the Middle East?  
R:  Okay, are we talking about the war, or, uh, the problems with Israel and Palestine?
L:  I think it's, um, both.  I mean, they said, um, one of the questions was, do you feel like peace will ever be obtained?
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, kind of icky topic.  I mean, how do you feel, um, with the whole war?  How -- like are you comfortable with the decisions that Bush has made?
R:  Um, I am.  I'm sorry we had to go to war, but, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I think we had to [LAUGH].  Um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think we've established ourselves as, uh, the power now pretty much [SIGH] in the world, um, and we'll get respect, I think, from other countries, although I'm disappointed that we haven't from Canada and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, the French countries and, uh, the --
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] uh, Russia --
L:  I -- yeah, see I don't really understand why we're at war.  Like, I honestly don't know what we're gonna get out of it.  Like --
R:  We're acting like we're giving more, um,  I mean we- we're liberating people that have been oppressed and, um, and it's gonna be hard.  I mean, I don't know that we're, um, we're -- I think we're, uh, seen as, you know, the savior [LAUGH] to the world and -- and so we're -- we're stopping a, um, maniac from killing, uh, his people.
L:  True.  But who are we to say, like, that they're uncomfortable or they're not happy with their current situation?
R:  Who are we to say that?
L:  Yeah, 'cause I mean we're going in there and Bush's whole thing is he want to liberate and it seems like he wants to create a democracy, but in the Middle East it doesn't seem like democracy could ever be something that would thrive just because their basis is so strong in religion [NOISE].
R:  Yeah, I -- that's one thing I -- I wonder about.  I've been to, um, Egypt.  I was there for three weeks and I've also been to, um, Jerusalem, uh, several cities in, um -- I've got a brain cloud [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- right now, but in Israel --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, um, and I've seen the way people live --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in Egypt, um, and yeah and I've seen -- ev- even -- this is like twenty years ago that I was there or fifteen --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- and -- and they were hating each other then, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the Palestinians and, um, the Jewish people, um --
L:  That's the thing like, it seems like it's so deeply rooted, like in the way they think, in the way they live their lives that I don't think by us intervening that it's gonna change any of the hostility towards each other.
R:  Yeah, I don't understand why they, uh -- just because somebody's religion is different, why you have to hate that person.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think all religions are good, you know, as long as y- -- uh, I think they make people more civilized and, you know, more -- make people better people and I just don't see, you know, hating somebody because of their religion or because they have different beliefs.  I mean, can you understand that? [LAUGH]
L:  I really can't.  I mean, I -- I -- I just -- I really don't understand why they can't like save themselves if it has to come down to that, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like why does there have to be any kind of like intervention between the two, um, countries?  You know.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I think, you know, what they're gonna attempt to do is to get -- well, they're gonna get 'em [SIGH] to try not to have that kind of, um, you know hate -- hate the different sects.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sects of the religion, you know, the Sheiks and the Baath Party and all the different, uh --
L:  Like when you think about it, there's so many people there that believe in what Saddam Hussein is doing and have such a respect for that -- for him, so that what -- it seems like even when this war is over, if it ever does finish, that, um, I think people'll just go back to having a, sort of like, dictatorship.  Because I don't think they --
R:  Well, that's why the United States --
L:  -- will embrace anything else.
R:  Well, that's why the United States is intervening, um, and they have people over there to -- and they're gonna get people from -- you have to understand that, um -- I don't know if you've ever been to any of the Arab countries, but they --
L:  Mm mm, no I haven't.
R:  -- they [SIGH] -- it's just unreal the way they live.  When I was in Egypt, um, well they were Muslim, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they are too and -- but it's a very backwards, you know, society.  I mean, you know, they just -- they still, you know, ride donkeys and carry [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  When I was there it was like, uh -- I really was reminded of, um, bible school and Sunday School when I was a child --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and all the pictures and the -- and the books, uh, that showed the, um, donkeys and, you know, the women carrying the food on their heads and all that -- that -- and it was really like that and the people lived in caves.  I mean, I was amazed but that's the way -- that's the way --
L:  Huh, well --
R:  -- they lived and, uh, you know, dirt roads, sand.  So, I was, you know, things have advanced but, um, I think if they believe in -- believed in Saddam Hussein -- although I don't think they r- -- that many of 'em did.  I think they did because they had to because he --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was a dictator.  I'm -- I just hope, you know, that's all anybody can do, is just hope that, um, you know, that they can live together like -- like we do and, you know, with the different divisions in the religions --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like they would have one basic belief.  I mean, they all believe in Allah [SIGH].
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  Um, but yeah -- it's like, you know, in England, uh, I never have understood all the conflict there but it's still -- there still is some between the Catholics and the Protestants [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's very true.
R:  And -- and they're certainly, I would think, you know, people that are educated and [SIGH] know better [SIGH], but --
L:  Right.
R:  I think the United States is just more, um -- we're a more sophisticated society and, um --
L:  I mean, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  Like I think in order for the world to go around you need some societies that are a little bit more advanced than others, you know --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- kinda like give and take and that's what makes the world go around.  I just don't understand like what the outcome is gonna be of this war.  Like I understand what -- why they're going there, but I don't really see it happening, you know.  I just think we're kinda like blindly going in and targeting a man just because he's the easiest target right now.
R:  Oh, I don't think that.  I think, you know, how many -- eight hundred thousand people he killed?  Uh, I think we're -- I -- I don't understand why he wouldn't cooperate with the, um, UN.  I don't -- I don't understand that.  It's almost like he has a death wish or something.  Or maybe he was just gonna dare us, you know, and didn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- think it would ever happen.  It's just ...  I think, you know, there was the dare.  He -- he apparently did just -- and maybe -- and maybe he didn't think we would act.  I don't know.
L:  Mhm.  So, then, in that case like why aren't we going after like North Korea, if we're gonna be consistent with the --
R:  Well -- well they're -- they're gonna have talks with them, um -- Lord I hope we don't have to go after them.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  Oh, but I -- I think we have established supremacy.  You know, um, by the way we've taken, um, Iraq.
L:  Well, that's true and they -- I mean, it's obvious that they're threatened by that and they don't want to, um, acknowledge that.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think that's where the stubbornness comes in on Saddam Hussein's part.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that's men, you know [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If he wasn't a man, he just [LAUGH] ...  I don't know, I -- I think my husband would, um, [SIGH] acquiesce before he would, you know, be killed. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.  But when you think about it, I mean, everything that they do is, you know, based on Allah and everything happens for a reason.  So, like they're not gonna just back down because some political power is saying so, you know.  'Cause to them there's something -- there's something much more than just international relations and that's, you know, religion.
R:  Yeah, that -- that when you play that into it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, that, you know, I think Catholics in Rome and all they -- they, uh -- I don't know if you're Catholic, or you [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, I'm Catholic.
R:  Oh, are y-.  Well, but th-, you know, they seem to be ruled by the Pope, pretty much.
L:  Mm
R:  Uh, I would never want, um, religious beliefs to dictate, you know, whether I was gonna abort a child or not or, you know, if I was raped.  I -- I just, you know, I guess they --
L:  Yeah.  But I think those are technicalities that come into play.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you have to be more of an i- individual as opposed to listening to just manmade doctrine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think there's a big difference between that, but, um, that definitely is a lifestyle.
