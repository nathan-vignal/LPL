R:  Hello, this is Nancy.
L:  Hi -- hi, this is Kimberley.
R:  Kimberley?
L:  Yeah.  At least I got a hello this time.  L- last night they called [LAUGH] and I kept saying, "Hello?  Hello?  Hello?" [LAUGH] and nobody --
R:  Oh my.  Well, you know what?  I couldn't hardly understand what we're supposed to be discussing.
L:  Oh, the, ah, conflict in the Middle East --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and whether or not we're, ah, w- whether we think that the US should stay there and whether, u- uh, if we think that peace will ever be resolved there, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I think that's about all that she said. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, I've -- I couldn't hear her, you know, it was like, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah" and [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I'm Kimberley, and I'm in Los Angeles.  Where are you from?
R:  Uh, I'm in Texas.
L:  Oh good, I'm from Texas. [LAUGH]
R:  You are?  From where?
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, originally Dallas.
R:  Well, this is, uh, do you know where a little town called McKinney is?
L:  Yes, I do know where McKinney is. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, then it's, uh, it's, uh, east of there --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and then a little north, in a little community called Verona.
L:  Oh my goodness.  Now, I haven't heard of Verona, but, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my parents live in Dallas --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so does my sister and brother and his wife, and then my other sister lives in Amarillo, so --
R:  Hey.
L:  -- um, and I lived in south Texas, down by Austin, ca- -- i- in a place called San Marcos for six years, so --
R:  Ah, yep, know where --
L:  -- ah --
R: -- that's at.
L:  -- lived in Carville and lived in Lubbock.  Basically, I've covered the gamut. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you sure have.  I've got a son that lives out in Lubbock, which is -- well, it's really Sw- -- Shallowater.
L:  Yeah, I -- I can't stand, uh, I -- I -- I didn't like Lubbock.  It was the most boring three months of my life. [LAUGH]
R:  It's too sandy out there.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Nothing's out there.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- too -- too windy and too boring, but, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of course I didn't have a car that summer either, so that made it worse.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, and I was e- eighteen years old, so that was really bad. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I say, yeah --
L:  But, uh --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  But, uh, anyhow, as far as the Middle East, I -- I -- n- n- -- I don't know how you feel, but I'm glad we're there and I'm hoping they'll stay there till they get something r- -- at least some part of it resolved.
R:  You're -- you said a mouthful.  I -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I believe that too because, I mean, I -- I believe that, uh, oh, sometime back when, um, oh, there was a general over there, and he was close to, I believe, Hussein --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he -- he asked, uh, the President at the time was President Bush --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- could he go in and get him, and President Bush told him, "No".
L:  [NOISE].  He didn't --
R:  He believed --
L:  -- have the congressional authorization, that was the problem.
R:  Mm.
L:  He didn't have the, uh, but now that we've got it, let's use it.  Let's go. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, yeah.
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  But -- but the thing of it is, if we had of gone in at that time, we wouldn't be bothered with old Hussein now, see?
L:  Oh, I know, but, uh, unfortunately, uh, I -- I think it took nine eleven to really wake people up enough to -- to get them to the point that they understood, I -- I mean, most of America is in support of Bush, and I'm real grateful for that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- even though we've got a few idiots out here who -- in Hollywood [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, of --
L:  -- who don't comprehend that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  But, uh, I think most of us who live in the real world do understand that there are some people who are just evil and you have to deal with that and --
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  -- if you don't -- and I'm so glad they put me on w- -- this had to have been God all the way around. [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause I was, like, you know, I -- I -- when she gave me the topic I said, "I sure hope I don't get one of those people who's against the war 'cause I'm gonna [LAUGH] --"
R:  Well, I tell you, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I just wouldn't --
R:  Well, [COUGH] I -- I tell you, you know, I -- I'm -- I am glad that we're over there, yes, and I think that we needed to do something to -- to show them over there that we mean business, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't come over here and kill, you know, three or four thousand people and then not expect us to do anything.
L:  Exactly, it just --
R:  I mean, they murdered 'em --
L:  Then --
R:  -- that -- that's the only thing I can say, they murdered 'em --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and when we went over there with -- with -- with airplanes and bombed over there, we -- sure, we -- we killed some innocent people, but not as many as they have killed.
L:  Yeah, and we were doing our best not to kill, uh, the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- innoc- -- we were t- -- I mean, President Bush, in their pla- -- the military's plan was very well thought out, and they've done their best at trying to keep this to a minimum, uh, to hurting the -- the civilians, but, you know, in any kind of war, you're going to have civilian lives lost.
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  That's just the way it is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, there's been very little life lost overall --
R:  Right, uh-huh. [COUGH]
L:  -- and, uh, you know, and -- and as far as there being real peace over there ever --
R:  No, there never will be.
L:  -- until Jesus comes back it's not going to happen. [LAUGH]
R:  They're not -- no, not until Jesus comes back, there will --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- never be peace over there.
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  Because, you know --
L:  -- that's what the Bible says, and, uh --
R:  That's true, because it's -- it's between the two sons, and I can't remember their --
L:  Cain and Abel.  N- no, actually --
R:  No.
L:  -- it was -- no, it was, uh, Esau and Jacob.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they -- they've always been --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- [inaudible] one another, and -- and the Lord says --
L:  It's so nice to --
R:  -- that they'll always be there.  It'll always --
L:  It's just so nice to talk to somebody who knows this.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It just, you know, e- e- especially -- I've such a day -- e- evening this evening with this woman who has been blackmailing me, 'cause I have fourteen cats and she's trying to force me to do what she wants me to do --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and so I'm having to try and deal with finding a way to get her out of my life, [SIGH] and, uh --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and so you're a welcome breath of fresh air. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just to not have to -- 'cause I was going, "I just am not up for another argument tonight [LAUGH] --"
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I don't need any more hassle", but, uh --"
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- anyhow, no, I'm, uh, uh, but --
R:  I know that some of our -- our guys have been, you know, killed, some of 'em accidentally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but then there were some that -- that Hussein had captured that they just -- I -- I know they just shot 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just -- just out and out --
L:  Well, I mean, you --
R:  -- shot 'em.
L:  -- uh, you see what they did to Jessica and the others --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that were held captive and, uh, you know th- --
R:  Yeah, they didn't do what was right, like in the -- I don't know what you call it, the -- the -- the Geneva Convention?
L:  The -- yeah, the, um, whatever, I -- I can't think of it either at the moment but, yeah, I know what you're talking about. 
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Um --
R:  Rules of war, something like that.
L:  Mm, yeah, something like -- yeah, it's a -- the -- the agreement of some sort.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I can't remember the name of it --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- but, um, they --
R:  [COUGH] When they flashed 'em on TV and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people saw 'em --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then sh- -- and, you know, just, uh, walked them, oh, oh.  I didn't see any of that, but I got, you know, little words and things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on my computer, and from different ti- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when I heard on, you know, the news and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I was like, "Oh, you know, my gosh".  But you know --
L:  Well, you've got a computer?
R:  Th- yes ma'am, mhm.
L:  Okay, let me give you my website.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that way, [MN] 'cause they're not going to give us much time.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH].  It's W.W.W.
R:  W.W.W.
L:  Dot whimsyway, W.H.I.M.S.Y.
R:  Do that again.  W.?
L:  W.H.I.M.S.Y.
R:  W.H.I.M.S.Y.
L:  W.A.Y.
R:  Whim- whimsyway?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.
L:  Dot com.
R:  Dot com.
L:  But -- you can email me through that.  But anyway, i- I had designed a, um, a card for our troops --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's on the site, um, that, uh, I -- somebody had asked m- --a friend had asked me to design, because they were doing care packages going over to our troops.
R:  Right.
L:  And I had written a poem for them to let them know that th- the majority of us over here do appreciate what they're doing.
R:  Correct.
L:  And that we are behind them a hundred percent.  We're not just saying we support our troops but not our president kind of garbage.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, how can you support the troops if you're not supporting their le- -- Commander in Chief?
R:  Right.  That's true.
L:  That makes no sense. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, um, but anyway, we're just -- i- it just, um, yeah, I -- I write children's stories and I'm starting my own line of greeting cards, so I'm [MN] involved with all that but, uh --
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  But I'm just so glad to hear somebody e- -- it was so nice to get somebody from --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- Texas on the phone. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Somebody from my home state, at least, that --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- knows what they're talking about.  But, um, it's just -- it's hard to -- to get, uh, t- to help some of these other people understand, and what's really sad is that they're just so -- i- i- it's selfish.  I'm sorry -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but that's basically what it amounts to, is that they don't want to go over there 'cause they don't want to lose any lives.  Well, you know, freedom costs.
R:  Yeah, yes.
L:  It's -- there's a price to be paid for it, and they don't want to pay any price.  They just want to have the -- the freedoms, but they've gotten spoiled, is what it amounts to.
R:  They want their cake and eat it too.
L:  Huh?
R:  They want their cake and eat it too.
L:  Yeah, and you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- can't do that.  Y- -- I mean --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- not in this lifetime at least --
R:  And --
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  -- some of those, you know, p- -- like you said, some of those movie stars out there, you know, they don't like some of the stuff, but you know what?  It -- somebody ought to send them over there and let them fight a little while.
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, uh, one of the things that -- whenever I was praying about it, God showed me was that the reason we're over there right now, because a friend of mine and I have gone through this, because she's against the [MN] war and stuff and I said -- we got into an argument about three weeks ago and I finally, you know, I wrote her a letter and I said, "You know, the reason we're over there is because there is a lot of those people over there who've gotten saved from watching Trinity broadcasting and --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- they have been praying to get delivered from Saddam Hussein".
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  And I said, "That's why we're there.  It's because God is answering those prayers, and he's trying to help these people and --"
R:  Yes.
L:  "-- you know, quite honestly, anybody who says they don't want to go over and help these people is just flat out selfish" --
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  -- you know?  They don't to --
R:  Do you think that Hussein has been killed or captured or --
L:  Oh, [SIGH] wh- who knows?  I mean, uh, uh, th- the fact that they h- haven't found his body makes me question that he's dead, but --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- you know, uh, he could be lying in wait some place or he could have escaped to a different country by now, you just don't --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- know.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And, uh, I mean, I don't think that he'll ever gain back the power that he has had, because I don't think anybody would ever give him that opportunity --
R:  That power over there.
L:  Yeah, I don't think --
R:  I think they don't like him now.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, they didn't -- I -- I don't think a lot of the people liked him to begin with.  The problem was is that they didn't have a way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to talk against him without --
