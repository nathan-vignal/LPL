L:  Hi.
R:  H- hi, this is Debbie.
L:  Hi, Debbie, this is Nancy.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you this evening?
L:  Good.  Where are --
R:  G- --
L:  -- you calling from?
R:  From, ah, Pennsylvania.
L:  Whereabouts?
R:  Near Pittsburgh.
L:  Oh.  I went to school in York.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I live in New Jersey.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, have you done this before?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Um --
R:  Have you?
L:  Yeah, but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's very, like, I don't know if we're doing it right or, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  They don't give you much feedback so --
R:  No, they don't.
L:  Yeah.  Um, so we're just supposed to talk about, ah, the Middle East.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, do y- -- I mean, I think I th- -- one question was do we think that, ah, the United States should stay involved?  And I think that we should because when -- with Desert Storm we pulled out and, you know, pretty much left it up to them to take care of it and we were right back where we started from.  So, I mean, I'm not that politically, ah, educated but from what I gather, that's what happened.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I'm not politically educated either but --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I agree with you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think -- I -- I think we did, that's what happened.  They --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pulled out too soon and I think they should stay this time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although the people seem to be against us now.  At first they were all for us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now they want us out of there.
L:  Well, I think that they want their land back probably.  But, I mean, I think we have to -- we have to stay somewhat involved.  I mean, our troops are still there and we still have -- th- -- aren't there still prisoners of war even, ar- right?  I mean, I think we got some of them back but I think there's still some prisoners there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, ah --
R:  And I think they have to look for tho- -- those weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Y- yeah.  And then with Syria, if we ha- -- you know, is -- is Saddam Hussein in Syria and -- or is he dead?  You know.  I think he's probably dead at this point but, um, you know, I -- I don't know.  [MN] I don't know that much.  This is a difficult topic for them to talk about. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is a little bit.
L:  For ten minutes.  What if you don't know that much about it?
R:  Right.  I don't either.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  But I -- I don't know.  As much as they fight over there, I don't think that peace will ever be attained over there.
L:  I don't think there's going to be world wide peace ever, anywhere.
R:  [MN] Uh-uh.
L:  But, ah, I mean, it's just -- I think -- I think they've been capturing -- I heard something on the radio about there's like, they have a -- a deck of playing cards with fifty two, like, top, um, you know, like evil [LAUGH] Iraqi powerful, you know, whatever they are, you know, leaders.  And I think they've ha- -- they have, like, seven of them in -- in -- in, ah, in capture right now.
R:  Oh.
L:  So that's a lot of, ah, a lot of people left, you know --
R:  Yeah, to ge- -- to get.
L:  -- that they haven't caught.  And -- yeah.
R:  And I think some of those probably are involved in this terrorist thing that went on in the US too so --
L:  Ah, yeah, I definitely think so.  I mean --
R:  That's another reason I think we should stay and monitor what's going on and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have our presence felt over there.
L:  And find those, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- find the -- see if they -- if they do have the weapons that they, you know, they keep saying they don't have and we keep saying they do have.  And I heard today also that they think that they destroyed them days before the attack, which I don't buy.  I mean, it has to be -- has to be somewhere, so.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah, I don't know if he destroyed 'em either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I think he thought he was going to win.
L:  Yeah, definitel- -- well, I mean, it's silly tha- that people are, like, thinking that he's still alive but there's so many -- there's -- there's st- -- there's footage of him, like, you know, walking around town.  And our -- our ability to know what's going on there and -- and know if there was such an uproar of, you know, supporters and what not, we would -- we would know that.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're saying we're -- that we're like two days behind or something like that.  But I don't know.  I don't d- -- I don't necessarily think that he's still alive.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  But, ah, I mean, his sons may be.  I don't -- I don't know, but -- [SIGH] so.  I don't know.
R:  I don't know.  I think the people will probably kill him if he does come up anyhow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- his own people.
L:  But you said that they're saying that -- that they're -- they're showing that they don't want us there anymore?  I haven't heard that.  What -- w- --
R:  [COUGH] Over the weekend they were showing that they wanted the Americans out of there now.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I don't know.  I'm thinking, "Well, here we come over and we rescued you and --"
L:  Well, they made such a -- they made such a big deal about -- remember the guy who put the American flag over -- over the statue?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they made him take it down.  So, I think that -- I think that the American troops and the British troops made a very valiant effort not to claim control but just to help and -- and give aid.  So, I -- I don't know.  There must be a lot of controversy there too because there's -- there's -- these people are raised, you know, brainwashed --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to believe that this guy was, you know, the best thing in the world.  And -- and then my dad was telling me over the weekend that they found, like, billions of dollars, um, in -- in some -- in one of, um, like one of his houses or something.  There was, like, a fake wall and they found, like, I think it was, like five hundred thousand dollar -- eh, five hundred thousand dollars in, like, boxes.  Like, maybe it was like a, you know, ten by -- ten by ten, ah, like, box.  And they found, like, you know, ten -- a hundred thousand dolla- -- or five hundred thousand dollars in each of these boxes and there's like hundreds of them.  So there's like --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- billions of dollars that was just recovered.  So -- but now they're wondering what to do with all this money.  Do w- -- do they give it to the -- do they give it to the Iraqis?  Do they give some -- like, they were saying, like, seventy percent to the Iraqis and then, you know, like, ten percent to the British and American, um, you know, casualties, like the families that were killed.  And then the -- the rest go into, like, the oil fields and all that.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, I don't know.  This is all things that my father tells me.  I don't know if it's right or not but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it probably is.  My goodness.
L:  It just gives us something to talk about though.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Do you -- do you think they're going to be capable of, um, keeping peace over there themselves, if they're --
L:  Um, themselves?  I mean, it depends on -- they have to have leaders, so it depends on who becomes the leader.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  It depends on -- on who -- if it's -- if it's just the guys that are there now, you know, that didn't have as much of a play -- that they couldn't have had any play, you know.  [MN] I don't know.  It's like, you know, when -- when the President goes it's the Vice President kind of thing.  And then the Secretary --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like, I don't know.  I don't know how that would work --
R:  Right, and w- --
L:  -- unless the peop- --
R:  We know that's how it goes and everything.  And over there they haven't had anybody stand out but him.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I don't know [COUGH] if it's something that the people would even be capable of -- of legislating --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they don't know any better.  They don't know how -- they don't know that the- -- that they can have rights and ... you know, and as far as history goes [COUGH] when other countries were liberated I don't know, you know, when -- when, like when France was liberated from, ah, from Hitler, like what happened then?  Like, who took over?  Do you know any of that?
R:  [MN] No, I don't.
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know how that would work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah --
R:  And I haven't heard anybody -- any name come up or anything stand out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I think --
L:  Just people right now --
R:  -- most of their political prisoners were dead so that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anybody that --
L:  And a lot of people are just turning themselves in right now too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I don't know -- I don't know if it could even be one of them because they were -- they were with -- with Saddam Hussein for so long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  And they might --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- want to take it back the way it was.
L:  And they all seem to be related at that p- -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They're all, like, cousins and brothers and in laws and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's sick. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, yeah, I think that's gonna be hard one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I think Syria's gonna be there [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trying to push in too.
L:  Yeah, but it seems like we h- -- we need to go to Syria now because they're -- you know, they're -- they're supporting -- they've been supporting Iraq and giving Jerusalem or, you know, Israel a hard time and, you know, you can't just -- we just, like -- you have to, you know, chip away at this.  You can't just go one place and then it's over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kind of what happened with, ah, with Desert Storm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  And I- and Iran was so bad there for a while and they've been quiet for a while.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you wonder if they're going to come back in the mix of things again.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now, ah -- but now France and, ah, who was the other one?  Germany, that didn't want to help us?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now they're saying like, you know, that it was good that we did it and -- you know, and like now that after it -- after it's all over, you know, they're -- they're applauding us.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  But, um ...
R:  [MN] And I don't know if sending the UN in will help that much either because the UN doesn't seem to --
L:  Yeah, they weren't helpful in the beginning, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Th- they were the ones that didn't want to go through with all this and -- and Bush was saying, you know, "I'm going to do with it without you".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  But, I mean, they've been over there and the people know that those inspectors have been over there and didn't do anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't know if that'll help keep the peace or not.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  That's a tough one.
L:  Yeah, and I [COUGH] I was really, ah, watching a lot in the beginning but it just, like, it seems like the same thing over and over and over and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- at this point and I'm just like, I've had enough.  That is terrible, I'm like ashamed to even say that but --
R:  Yeah, me too --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it is, yeah.
L:  I don't know enough to even understand what, you know, even th- th- the icing of this, let alone, you know, the whole -- the whole mix of everything that's going on.
R:  I agree with you.  And then when they explain it they're way over my head.  [COUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's why I get the footno- -- the footnotes from my dad.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause they get these generals on there and they say all this stuff and you have no clue what they're talking about.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I try to listen to talk radio and I'm like, okay.  And you hear the callers call in and I'm like, okay.  And you hear all these different opinions but I -- I don't know.  [SIGH] So --
R:  I do- -- maybe some of the people that have taken refuge
