R:  Hi.  This is Dianne.
L:  This is Debbie.
R:  Hi, Debbie.
L:  Hi.
R:  Um, Middle East. [SIGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  What a mess, uh?
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [MN] And the question of whether or not peace will ever be obtained over there, I don't know anybody that can answer that one.
L:  I don't think it ever will be.
R:  Well, it's -- it's been a way of life for them for so terribly long -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and if you look at what's happening in Afghanistan, that's anything but stable.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, --  
L:  Well, the Middle East has been horrible for years.
R:  For ever and ever.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'd -- I would think that the show of force that we presented would cause them to at least pull back and have some second thoughts about their behaviours if George Bush threatens them.
L:  Who's that?
R:  The various Middle Eastern countries, such as -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  Syria -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with, uh, potential things going on there, and, um, I know if I was one of those countries around Iraqi I would certainly think twice about irritating or doing anything to -- 
L:  Upset us. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  I know.   
R:  Right.  
L:  Yes, they should and -- and I think the Iraqis decided to give up altogether.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they pretty much have.  We've just got a few pockets here and there -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, I don't know.  Those --  those people are really -- they don't know how to behave under freedom.
L:  Well, no, they don't.  That's why they're hoping that new person that's coming in -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe, but they still have to get rid of Saddam Hussein.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They still don't know if he's around or if he isn't around.  They have no proof yet.
R:  Well, I -- hopefully they can at some point prove that, but it could be a -- could be a while.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know if they'll ever be able to prove if he's a- -- well, if he's alive, he'll show up again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Obviously.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they're starting to capture a bunch of the people that are close to him, including brothers in law and sons in law.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  They just got someone today I heard.
R:  Did they?  What did they get today?  
L:  Er, someone that's like eighteenth on the list.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Great.  I didn't hear that one.  I haven't had the news on for a while.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] So, yeah, they are starting to get them, but, uh, you know, they have to get the main guys.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, you know, it could be another Gadhafi where you, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for a while we didn't know what happened to him.
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, and, um, the other guy, bin Laden.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Who knows about him?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, he could surface again, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, --  
R:  I think the whole thing is very frightening and I think that the Muslims per se are getting a bad rap.  I don't think the Muslim religion itself is a bad religion.  I think it basically is the religion of love and peace -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  But I think that a huge, huge per cent of it has -- has gone wacko on the thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's -- you can't hardly fight a crazy religious belief.
L:  No, no, you can't -- 
R:  You know -- 
L:  You can't -- 
R:  -- there are just no -- no way -- 
L:  The politics is what they [several inaudible words] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, it's just a shame over there, er, you know.  It's, uh, you know, they're not educated enough to know what what's happening -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- too, you know.  I mean they don't -- they don't even know what's going on in their own country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, I don't think they were allowed to know for a long time.
L:  Right.
R:  The thing that really, really disgusted me was when they went into some of those storage warehouses and found all this food that had been sent over under the food for oil -- 
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- thing rotting -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and not distributed to the people.
L:  Right.
R:  All taken by the, the, um, army and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It's just really, really sad.
L:  Well, I don't think there'll ever be, you know, real peace over there.
R:  No, look at Israel and Palestine.
L:  Right, yeah.  There'll never be peace there.
R:  No.  
L:  No.
R:  I don't know how they could ever accomplish it.
L:  No.  I don't think there ever will be because Israel wants certain pieces of land -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and Palestine wants land and nobody is going to give up what they have.
R:  Right.
L:  So I don't think there's going to be peace over there ever.
R:  No.
L:  Which is a shame, too, because they're not large countries.
R:  Did you watch much of the war?
L:  Parts of it.
R:  I tell you some of the equipment we had over there just blew me away.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
R:  I had no idea we had such equipment.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Such -- so sophisticated and -- and when they were in that square and that tank came up and unloaded that crane to topple that statue I thought who would ever think of a tank having a crane.
L:  Right, yeah.  That's true.
R:  Just -- I tell you, I -- I don't think I would want to be an enemy of the United States right now.
L:  No, I certainly wouldn't, but then, on the other hand, I wouldn't want my son there either. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, isn't that sad.  We've really had a remarkably low number of casualties considering.
L:  We've had quite a few in --  in my area.
R:  Have you?  Where's your area?
L:  In Ohio.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  Yeah.  There's been quite a few young men -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- who haven't come back.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So sad.
L:  Yes, it's very sad.  I mean, there were, er, quite a few groups from here that went -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- you know, reserve units.
R:  See, out here in Arizona I mostly know retired people, so unless somebody has a grandson or something. 
L:  Yeah, but you've got those air for -- you've got an air force base out there.
R:  Yes, but that's, uh, -- 
L:  Army.
R:  -- that's far enough west of where we are.  That's probably an hour and a half from us -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so we don't really have contact with people connected there either.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  I mean, you know it's there, but it doesn't -- we don't hear the stories of the connections and the people and things, you know.
L:  Yeah.  It's just scary for the people that live around that area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, which might daughter and my sister live right there. [LAUGH]
R:  Do they?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Out by Luke?
L:  Not far from there.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Yeah, so ... 
R:  Huh. 
L:  But anything within miles from there, you know, if something were to happen.
R:  Well, we've got that huge -- in fact it's the biggest nuclear -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- power plant around -- 
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- out here and I figure that would certainly make a good target.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I frankly have been extremely surprised by the lack of retaliatory terrorism.
L:  Well, yeah, me too, but I'm thrilled by it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It doesn't make me comfortable, though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I think they wait for to us let our guard down.  I -- I just can't believe we've split them up that badly, although I think we have done some damage -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to the chain of command.
L:  Well, that's the important thing, is to get to the top there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The top people, the one giving, you know, the ones giving the orders -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and you know, hopefully we've hurt them enough -- 
R:  Aha.
L:  -- that either if he's alive he doesn't have his men under him or he's not alive.
R:  I'd -- I'd like to see -- see somebody capture bin Laden.
L:  Oh.
R:  I would feel so much more comfortable.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But he's got so many young men under him that are just as violent.
L:  And I thought the Israel- -- yeah, I thought the Israelis would go in and get him.
R:  Did you? 
L:  I did.  
R:  Ahah.
L:  I did.  If anybody could really get him, I think it would be them -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they have an excellent secret service --
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and I really thought they would go get him.
R:  I've been amazed at the number of, uh, terrorist attacks, suicide attacks, etcetera, that Israeli has been able to thwart.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I guess that's probably been going on over there but we really didn't hear about it as much.
L:  Well, for a time there was, there was a lot of them -- 
R:  Yes, there was.
L:  -- a lot of suicide bombings -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- over there.
R:  I just can't imagine a religion that promotes that.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Everything is so totally foreign to our way of thinking -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that you can't even imagine it and, by the same token, they can't imagine anything like we have.
L:  No.  No.  I'm sure they can't. [LAUGH] I'm sure they can't.
R:  It's really crazy.
L:  It is.  Uh, I, you know, --
R:  It will be interesting to see what happens now to the oil on the reconstruction and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I was quite proud of the army when they came up with all those millions and millions in cash and have it stashed for the people -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then when they took, um, a large amount of money here, like, was it six hundred million, and sent over for reconstruction and -- and getting aid to the people -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's from the Iraqi frozen funds.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, there is -- there's money -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to be had if they can just find it all.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think they need to finish up and get our guys out of there.
R:  Mhm.  I don't think you they will, though, for a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think you'll be peace keeping and -- and things for a while.
L:  Right.
R:  But at least they won't be fighting.
L:  Yeah.  I hope not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I hope not.  Er, you know, i- it's not fun to see, it's scary, you don't know what type of, uh, equipment they're going to use.
R:  You -- you can't trust anybody.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  The pregnant woman that came screaming out of the car.
L:  Yeah.
