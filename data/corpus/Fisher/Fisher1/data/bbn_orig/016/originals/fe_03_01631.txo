L:  Hello, my name is Brigitte Sneck.
R:  Hi, I'm Stacey Charles.
L:  Hi, where are you located?
R:  I'm in Chatsworth, Georgia.  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  Okay.  I'm in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I guess we're supposed to talk about, um, th- -- what's going on with the war and everything.
R:  I guess.  O- or all the things in the Middle East. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, what do you think about happened over there?
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Well, I think it's a great thing to get him out of power, you know, because he is nothing but [MN] evil. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, for sure.  Gosh, isn't it amazing how fast it happened?
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I- I'd like to know for sure that they got him [inaudible].
L:  Oh, for sure, for sure.  'Cause that's the still the question.  It seems like h- -- apparently he keeps popping up everywhere.
R:  [MN] [NOISE] Right, or  we'll relive what we went through [MN] with the Gulf War. [inaudible]
L:  Right, exactly. [MN]
R:  He could still come back if all of his --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, sons and [NOISE] everything are still there, some of 'em.  Or what not.  He could still take power over again.
L:  [NOISE] Right, exactly.  Well, he could intimidate the people the way he did last time and scare them and get them all [NOISE] [MN] thinking that this is, you know, that he's going to take over again and scare them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, it's a -- kind of a frightening situation when you really think about it.
R:  Yes, [NOISE] true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, [MN] you know, [NOISE] he'd use any means necessary.
L:  Exactly.  It's just -- I remember when they first sa- said they bombed him, you know, 'cause I w- -- I was at a friend's house and I was house sitting and I got up and I turned on the TV and it said we'd just bombed [NOISE] -- hit wherever he's at or whatever.  I was so surprised.
R:  Yeah, me too when I first -- when I seen it on the news. W- well, I think a lot of people were.  The -- the-- the troops didn't even know [LAUGH] it was going to happen so ...
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  It was so [inaudible] [NOISE].  And of course my mind went immediately, like, how lucky could we get --
R:  Really.
L:  -- to get him on the first shot? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, really. [NOISE]
R:  I was hoping that would have happened but ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  It just -- I mean, [MN] I -- I support our troops and President and everything he's doing but [SIGH] i- -- like, if they don't get him it's like [MN] useless to me, in a way --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- you know, that --
L:  Well, of course they -- the people are apparently +free.  I mean, the- they're starting to feel free at least.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Without that bondage of him being around.  So that's one good thing.
R:  Yeah.  Well, there's still -- if you see some of 'em Arabs you [inaudible] say, "How's it feel to be free?"  Or you think -- [MN] they won't comment 'cause they're still scared.
L:  Right.
R:  So, he may be somewhere. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you can just imagine.  I mean, and every once and a while he probably [NOISE] pops out on one of their Iraqi TV stations and saying, "I'm still here" whether he really is or not.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  I just can't imagine living like that myself.  Course we live in the United States, how could we imagine.
R:  Really, that's true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  W- we've got every freedom there is but ...
L:  Exactly. [NOISE]  Well, what do you think about these people that were protesting the war?  Do you think that that was a bunch of nonsense [NOISE] or do you think they should have just [MN] took it and shut up? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, honestly I think they should just shut up but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, like, that's their right.  I mean, that's one of the freedoms we have over here so ...
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, we had 'em here in --
R:  [inaudible] I don't want war no more 'n anybody else but ...
L:  [MN] Well, exactly.  I mean, my son could be c- -- I mean, if they -- if this had gone on and there was a draft my son could have been called up 'cause he's only twenty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He could have been drafted.
R:  Right.
L:  And so it's -- it really scared me to think that he might be drafted into something [NOISE] that I necessarily wouldn't want to happen.  But by the same token I wouldn't want him not go defend our country, whatever way the President said that that's what he wanted.
R:  [MN] Right, yeah.  Y- yeah, my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I had family serve and everything and, like I said, I support 'em a hundred percent.  I -- you can't just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- support 'em ten percent and say, "Well, that's okay" and, you know, agree with some things.  You have to go all the way. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  I mean, not to say that -- that's their right and everything but if they're going -- I think people, if they're going to live in the United States, they need to stand behind it.  It's just, you know -- they got a choice, they don't have to live here either. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, that's true.  I mean, they can go some place and see what's it really like to be oppressed and to be afraid.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  And wasn't it exciting about the way they got, um, that -- that PFC Lynch out?  [NOISE] I mean, was that just a miracle or what?
R:  Oh, I think it was a miracle.
L:  Gosh.
R:  We had said prayers for all of 'em and --
L:  Oh, definitely.  [NOISE] That was just --
R:  I'm surprised he got home.
L:  I mean, that was incredible.
R:  Yeah.  I've seen some videos the day of the other seven getting home and that was good.
L:  Yeah, that was really good.  I was glad they got that other girl.  It was too bad that one girl died though.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  I hate it, girls going to war, personally.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I do too but that's something that women have fought for t- -- they're just as good as a man so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  If that's what they want to do, more power to 'em I guess.
L:  Yeah.  L- like I'm glad I was never in a position [NOISE] to be young enough that if there was a draft and they started drafting girls that I'd be one of the ones to get drafted.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I never had any desire to go in the military.
R:  Me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Too much work for me. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Golly.  [MN] Well, do you think we're going to have peace now?
R:  [MN] I don't think it'll be quick.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't think.  'Cause Palestine and all them are uprising, you know, against us.  Th- they don't like it because --
L:  Yeah, exactly. [MN]
R:  You know, he has power over them too, whether they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- admit it or not.  But ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  [inaudible] so [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know what your beliefs are but I go by bible too and I put that into perspective too.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, totally.  I totally agree.
R:  And --
L:  I -- I mean, I totally see scripturally what's happening and what's going to happen now, because this is it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we're getting down to the last [MN] -- to the end.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So we may never see peace again on [NOISE] -- on this side of heaven anyway.
R:  That's true.  I know, um, the only thing is if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we get in there and try to [SIGH] break, ah, Palestine and Israel up, that's -- you know, I just hope we stand behind Israel because that's what we're supposed to do, I think.  But they've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They've got to show some people. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  So.  But ...
L:  Gosh, I totally agree with you.  I'm just [NOISE] -- it's kind of scary to think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, fortunately we have a Godly President --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so it's going to work out [NOISE] well because he's made the decision that he's going to do what's right.
R:  Right.
L:  Hopefully he won't be swayed.
R:  That's true.  I -- I'm thinking abo- -- too, what, um, we were talking Korea and all that, the uprising over there and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- keep putting it in the news with this and, I'm like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I wish that we'd concentrate on our efforts over there first, Afghanistan and Iraq, and get them under control, what we need to do and get them idiots out of there. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Before we move on to somebody else [inaudible].
L:  Oh, for sure.  'Cause, I mean, we've got to -- I heard that -- that retired general that's going in today for the administration.  He's [MN] -- you know, he's going to be the administrator over there.  And it seems like he's got some good plans, [MN] you know.  I don't know if you heard the news today but he's going to go in and restore the water and he was in a hospital already and so he really wants to turn things around.
R:  Yeah.  Well [inaudible].
L:  So, that was a good thing.
R:  I didn't see that, I missed that.
L:  That was o- -- I was driving to work this morning and I heard it on the radio about [MN] b- -- [MN] whoever this guy is, this retired general that's going to be the administrator over there, until they can put somebody in.  'Cause that's going to be the key.  It's who are they go- -- how are they going to decide who they're going to put into office --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to run it now that Saddam is out, that Saddam can't come in and intimidate or assassinate.
R:  Right.  I mean, the ones that were in there before he moved up the ladder took him at his word and, what, the first day he called them in and was talking to them and he took 'em all out and hung 'em.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so, I mean -- they -- it's what I -- it goes back to what I was saying.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They need to make sure they have him and all his little twelve down the line descendents I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  It would be [inaudible] too.
L:  Well, and I also did hear -- well, I -- I'm -- I also heard today too that they got one of his son in laws or -- one of Saddam Hussein son in laws too today, that they've arrested.  And I think he was like, [MN] I don't know, number forty or something on the top fifty five wanted list or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it seems like they're starting to, you know, pick 'em out and get 'em a little bit at a time.
R:  Right.  I [inaudible] the -- you know, if it takes a while to do that I think that's what their goal needs to be, just to make sure.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because if, I think, they rush and put somebody in power and start doing everything. it could be a mistake if they do it too quickly.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  [inaudible] that, you know, that aint for sure if they got everybody. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, what did you think about all that looting?  I was surprised when they -- when they were [inaudible] let them loot the capital and stuff.  I wasn't expecting that.
R:  Oh, I wasn't either.  But, I mean, once again I can't imagine being that suppressed, not having water and watch him, at his homes, have all these fountains and everything and swimming pools going and not have anything, you know.  [NOISE] And they think he's dead and they're going to rebuild and all this.  It may be their only --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- chance to get anything.  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I was surprised that -- [MN] I guess though we didn't have the manpower --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to sit there and keep that under control and fight too at the same time.
L:  Yeah, probably not.
R:  I don't know but [MN] --
L:  And maybe you shoul-
R:  It was shocking but still, I can kind of see if -- I don't know.  I think that I wouldn't react the same way if I'd been, you know, liberated and stuff.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know and th- -- I'm sure probably some of the soldiers were probably even thinking, "Hey, you know, this is the government buildings, why not?"
R:  Yeah, really.
L:  That's what my friend said.  She said, "It's a government building, why not?"
R:  [inaudible].
L:  You know, he took it from them, it's their stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that could be.  [LAUGH] I mean, they kept it from them for so long. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, but, like --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  What was it, that pr- -- that prison he has for boys --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and he goes to their family.  And if they won't turn 'em over at, what is it, like age twelve to fight in his army, they refuse to go he throws in that prison to work for him.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  Did you see all that?  All those --
L:  I didn't.  I s- -- is that the torture chamber that you're talking about?
R:  It's, ah -- well, there's a building that he had over like, so many thousand I think, kids.  Boys, all boys.  And if they refused to fight in his army, train for his army, they to -- took 'em away from the parents and threw 'em in there.
