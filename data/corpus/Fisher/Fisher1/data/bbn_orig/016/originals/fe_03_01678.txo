L:  Hi.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Yeah, uh, who are you?
R:  Uh, hi, um, my name is Don.
L:  Hi, what's up Don?  I'm John.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where you from?
R:  Uh, well, from, uh, New York State.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I'm from, uh, Michigan State, actually.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's where I'm at school.  So, what do you think about this whole, uh, Middle East conflict, huh?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I think that, uh, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's something that we've gotten way too involved in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know, I think that there's a lot of, uh, expense that the, uh, country isn't prepared for in the Middle East.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh, I think we've -- you know, I mean, I think we've left a mess in Afghanistan and we're -- if we're not careful, we'll be leaving a similar mess over in Iraq.
L:  Mhm.  Huh.  So, you don't feel that we should have gotten involved in this war, even though it's turned out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so positively?
R:  No, no.
L:  Not at all?  Well, I mean, um, I had this discussion with my roommate earlier, don't you feel that Saddam Hussein was some sort of threat at all, or no?
R:  Um, possibly, but I -- I -- just not enough, I didn't feel strongly enough that, uh, we needed to take the action that we did.
L:  Really?  Well, I guess I kinda have to question that because, you know, I mean, we saw Saddam gas the Kurds to the north and, I mean, does -- isn't that extreme enough of an action for you to make, uh -- to, uh, justify s- -- the, uh, the course of action we took?  Or -- I mean, I -- I guess I'm failing to understand why you wouldn't think that's enough, uh, justification.
R:  Well, now, I -- I felt that, um, the, uh -- I thought that our motives would be questioned from the start --
L:  Mm.  Of course, yeah, mhm.
R:  -- and I think they'll continue to be questioned.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, uh, I think that, uh, we're going to be, uh, held responsible now for a- an awful lot more than we ever bargained for.
L:  Well, what do you mean?
R:  Uh, in terms of curing the ills of Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, there's a lot of problems over there, and it -- it -- it's an incredible -- there's incredible needs over there that, um, you know, we're not, you know, basic needs here in this country that we shouldn't be overextending ourselves --
L:  Oh, I see what you're saying.
R:  -- in another country.
L:  Yeah, okay.  Well, I mean, don't you feel to a certain extent being that we are as rich as we are that we have a certain responsibility to, uh, to those other countries in curing their ills, as you said?
R:  Well, it -- you know, we do.  But I think that, uh, we need to -- if we're having a -- a responsibility to other countries I think we need to work with other countries in that responsibility --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to -- to just, uh, overstep the UN and arbitrarily do our own thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- irrespective of, uh -- you know, I mean, we -- we had very little support, really.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, I mean, they may have listed a lot of two bit countries in support of us but, uh, among major countries we really didn't have very much support to move ahead with this war.
L:  Well, I mean -- but why do you think that is?
R:  Uh, a lot of reasons go into that but, uh, and -- and you know, I'm sure a lot of self interest goes into --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, when, uh, France has a lot of, uh, uh, debt to Iraq and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they of course want to be repaid, they know that the odds of that are pretty slim if Iraq is, uh, blown to smithereens.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, you know, there's a lot of self interest, certainly.  
L:  Right.
R:  But nonetheless, uh, to -- for us to move ahead without the, uh, UN sanction I think puts us immediately in the, um, in a negative light among the Arab w- world, and I think we continue to be in a negative light among the A- Arab nations.
L:  Hm.  I see.  But, I mean, earlier, weren't you just saying that we should be more concerned about our -- our troubles at home and that we're overextending ourselves --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- so, I mean, it seems like you question France's motives in, uh, not supporting us because, you know, they were very self interested, but isn't that very much the same thing that's occurring with us, you know?  If, uh -- according to you, at least.  I'm -- I'm just -- I'm just asking, I'm curious.
R:  Y- no, I'm not sure I follow the line.  [MN]
L:  Mm-kay.  Well, basically just, like, you questioned France's -- you questioned the fact that France didn't support us in the war, correct?
R:  Right, that they have their own self interest at heart.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Right.  So, I mean, if you question that, then why would -- why would you suggest that we should be, uh, interested in ourselves first, instead of, uh, uh, helping out these other countries or protecting ourselves, you know?
R:  Okay, okay.  I see what you mean.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, oh, well, I -- you know, I -- I guess I don't necessarily question or say that that's wrong --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I just say that their motivations for w- why they choose to support or not support a war in Iraq are complicated --
L:  Right.
R:  -- are complex.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know, I -- I think that there is also a large sentiment too, that, uh, many of the problems in Iraq, uh, we had a -- a major role in -- in developing.
L:  Really?  What do you mean by that?
R:  In -- in -- our past support of -- of Saddam --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in his war against Iran --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, you know, we, um, the -- uh, what was it?  The  a lot of impact of -- yu- -- one heard quite a bit about how if we ever found m- -- weapons of mass destruction, they'd probably would largely say, "Made in the USA" on them.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Uh, that we supported them i- i- in terms of even arms, providing arms to Iraq.  And, uh, you know, in a -- in a sense I couldn't blame other countries for saying we made the problem, we can deal with the problem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We're on our own.
L:  Hm.
R:  I -- I think that there's a lot of history there that, uh, you know, [inaudible] used to be the ambassador to Iraq and, uh --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, a lot of -- there's this whole, uh, reparation thing with, uh, Bectal[?] Corporation moving right in and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- taking over, uh, with, uh, uh, what's his name?  Ronnie[?] Bectal that, uh, used to be Reagan's, uh, Secretary of State, I think he was?
L:  Can't -- I can't say I honestly remember.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Um, Bectal [several inaudible words] for all sorts of money after being one of the largest campaign contributors to the Republican party and President Bush.
L:  [SIGH] So, you view this war as, uh, solely -- I -- I don't know, like --
R:  I -- I view it -- don't view it solely as anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just see a whole lot of negative motivations going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and from all different sorts of angles here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, uh, I just see very little truly good coming from it --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, and -- and I can't say that I blame the average Iraqi sitting over there without electric, without water, without much of anything, being really pleased that they're free now of Saddam.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  They may have had it --
L:  W- Well -- oh well, but I mean, isn't that a positive -- positive result of this war, and I mean --
R:  Maybe --
L:  -- even -- even --
R:  -- maybe not.
L:  -- that there may have been some negative motives?
R:  Maybe, maybe not.  Now, in Afghanistan, we got the warlords moving right in and taking over, and they're running things, uh, probably not too far afield from what the Taliban were doing.  How do we know the same isn't going to happen in Iraq?
L:  Um, you know, I -- I really don't know.  But, I mean, um, as I've seen, it seems like that in -- we've -- we've kept a certain responsibility, maybe because of Afghanistan, in our endeavors in Iraq in that we have to establish some sort of, uh, some sort of, I guess, law system over there, some sort of justice at this time.  So, I mean, w- -- from what I've --
R:  I think the magnitude of change that's needed requires so much more than anything that we as one nation can offer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, in -- in one effort, um, a culture that's so radically different --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that to -- to expect that, uh, Iraqis are going to, uh, bow down in gratitude for the, uh, honor of democracy being whisked upon them or -- or whatever, you know, I just think that that's a -- that's a real fantasy that -- that the Republicans had, that the, uh, Iraqis were going to be so grateful for --
L:  Well, I mean -- but, in all honesty, do you b- -- do you believe that that's -- that's the kind of viewpoint that we've taken, that we were gonna -- some sort of cultural imperialism, just come over there and just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- assume that that -- that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's how you feel?
R:  Yeah.
L:  In all honesty?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I mean, haven't you -- haven't you listened --
R:  I think -- I think it's very, very, uh, egocentric for us to assume that, uh, you know, the way we run the show is -- is, uh, the best way for a totally different culture to run their operation.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I -- I guess I have to disagree with you there, just because, you know, I can't -- I can't honestly believe that we would, um, just throw our system on top of theirs.  I mean, it seems like we've been trying to work with their people in order to establish some sort of working government, because we understand that.  Should we -- I mean, we're under a lot of -- under a lot of kind, uh, under a lot of -- what word am I looking for here?  Just, um  [LIPSMACK] uh, we're -- we're being -- we -- we're being watched by everyone, you know?
R:  Of course, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so I mean, I don't think that our government is stupid enough to, like, try to enforce our -- our way of life on them because, you know, it -- that's going to be seen as a very imperialistic move by the rest of the world.  I think that we have a certain responsibility to the rest of the world, and people are -- and --
