R:  They are trying to get rid of a bad man.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hello, call partner.  I was -- started talking and I wasn't sure whether anybody was there or not.
L:  I'm here.  Yeah, I was still listening to the recording and then I heard you as they were going off.  My name is Karen, I live in the state of Washington.
R:  Karen, it's nice to talk to you.  I'm over here in Philadelphia.  I've never been -- I've never been in the state of Washington.  Maybe I will be some day.
L:  It's beautiful and green here, everything that it's not in the Middle East. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, we'll get back to the topic, then.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know what you've heard, so I will try to rephrase myself.  I think peace will only come when people want peace.  Governments can't mandate it, lawyers can't decree it.  Nobody can decree it until two groups of people say, "You know what?  We're tired of killing you and hope you're tired of killing us".
L:  I agree, but the problem with that is that these people unfortunately with the government that they have had, have been taught from birth so much different than what reality is that they don't even know what they would truly be fighting for. You know.  They've all been so brainwashed in their idiocy and the thought processes against the imperialists and everything, you know, and it's really sad.  I mean, I'm glad that we went in and did what we did, even though it did cost some of our soldiers' lives.  I think it was necessary.
R:  But misfortunately[?] that's why they call -- it sounds clicheish, I know, but that's why they call it war.
L:  Right.
R:  People have to -- people have to fight and people have to die.
L:  Yes, and unfortunately a lot of people -- like, I have this argument with my mother every time we see her because she thinks we have no business there and, I'm sorry, after nine one one I think that it was really important that we sent out a message that no more of this terrorist attitude will be tolerated at all.
R:  Just think of Neville Chamberlain.  Uh-oh, I could be dating myself now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Neville Chamberlain had done that all those many years ago -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [MN] that -- that could have saved a whole lot of hassle back then.
L:  Yeah.  Think of how many people would still be around.
R:  Yes.
L:  If they had made the move then and I think that that's our problem, they have always perceived us as being weak, because we're pacifists as we try to be, but, you know, that doesn't necessarily mean weakness tha- -- and I know -- that's the whole thing, that's the problem.  It's the way that the men have been raised in the Middle East.  The only thing that they do understand is power and you can't have everybody trying to have this immense amount of power without having to have the struggles that go with it.
R:  That's true.  With every --  with every right comes responsibility.
L:  [NOISE] Right, and unfortunately, as we -- as we've seen in the rule of Hussein, there was no responsibility to the people.
R:  No, there was only the responsibility of not getting caught.
L:  Only the res- responsibility of amassing as much immense wealth as he possibly could at the cost of the people and now we've got all this stuff still going on with Israel and -- I mean, every entity over there is fighting amongst themselves.  I don't -- I -- do you really think that they will ever achieve peace?
R:  [SIGH] That -- if I could give you that straight answer to that, ma'am, I would be -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  I don't think so.
R:  I -- I would -- I would be in -- I would be in Washington or in some think tank or something like that.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
R:  I think peace will only come, like I -- like I said, when people -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get tired of killing -- get tired of killing each other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, there is a sort of peace, you could say, in Northern Ireland now.
L:  Right.
R:  I can remember back as a kid hearing all about Northern Ireland and all this stuff that had happened o- -- that had happened over there.
L:  [NOISE] Right, but then we achieved [NOISE] this peace here in the United States and then look what happened to our peace on nine eleven.
R:  I -- that's an interesting premise.  I'm not sure if we've -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if as Americans we've ever been at peace with ourselves, but I don't want to get too metaphysical -- 
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- regard- regarding this.
L:  Right.  I think we're looking at more for an overall peace picture of getting along with each other in a society, not necessarily our turmoi- -- our in- inner turmoils.  Otherwise we can say, "Absolutely not, we are too human to ever resolve all of our issues".
R:  Well spoken.  Well said.  I like that.  I'm going -- I'm going to use that in some other conversations down the line.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know.  I just -- I was, you know, a little shocked when they went in and heard some of the things they found with the [NOISE] torture sites [NOISE] and the decomposing bodies [NOISE] and -- and you have to figure, you know, if it takes a few lives to end as much of that kind of inhumane treatment that was going onto these people, then you have to agree to some level that you can't say, "It's not my problem".  It is our world.
R:  Yes, it is -- it is our world and one of the other questions they brought along in this introduction was that do we [MN] --  do we continue the role of policeman -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to which I say, "Heck, yeah", because nobody else is stepping up -- 
L:  That's right, until they can -- 
R:  -- stepping up to the bat.
L:  Right.  I agree with that. 
R:  I mean are we -- are we going to count on the French for anything?
L:  Heck, no, [NOISE] and we shouldn't allow the French to step in for anything.  They didn't want to be involved in it.  Now the only reason they'd want to be involved in anything is for the financial gain they might perceive coming their way from it. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, most definitely, I -- most definitely.  I agree with you there, but now -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we'll see how --
L:  But we're too diplomatic and we'll have to say, "Well, we need, you know, our NATO friends --" 
R:  Yes, we -- 
L:  "-- we need to get everything back intact again", so we'll have to bury the hatchet and of course allow them to get back involved. 
R:  We -- we -- we have the overwhelming urge, as I'll put it, in this country, the overwhelming urge and need to be nice -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- which is prob- -- which raises a lot of questions with me because over the years I'm not sure how nice I've been in various encounters, but I find myself less nice as we go along.
L:  Right.  Hardened through life, though, unfortunately.  It's the experiences that create it, not the attitude, not the willingness to [MN] -- you know, our less willingness, shall we say, to maintain the niceties. [NOISE]
R:  Sometimes even in the raising of our own children -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sometimes someone just has to say no.
L:  Right, but those are boundaries and I think that that pertains to all society.  When we raise our children it's necessary for us to give them boundaries for their own safety --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and that's why I think that until an entity gets involved with the situation that's capable of policing the situation, it is our responsibility to those people to not do as we did in Kuwait and just back out and leave them hanging.
R:  Oh, yes.  In fact -- well, I don't know if it played out on the west coast there, but over the news this weekend there was talk of a -- of a rally in -- a rally in Baghdad by the -- the Islamic -- by the Islamic militants about [LIPSMACK] about time -- telling us it's time -- telling us it's time to leave.
L:  "Time to go home".  Hm.  Yeah, okay.  Well, "Just a few days before that we had an incident in Baghdad but we're supposed to leave and think that everything will be okay and let you guys kill it -- um, fight it out amongst yourselves now" and there's obviously still militia around at some point, so you lay your bat -- you lay down your gun for a week and we're supposed to say "Okay, we're done" and walk off?  I'm sorry, I don't agree.
R:  I -- and -- and I basically -- I basically agree with you.  We're probably going to be there for a while -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how long a while is -- 
L:  However long it takes them to get -- because I don't think we should appoint a new government.  I agree to the point that, you know, now it has to be their government created by them, but in the meantime if they can't --
R:  If they can't -- if they -- 
L:  -- step up to the task --
R:  -- or if they can't find --
L:  -- we may have to --
R:  Yeah, right.  If they -- it's just like in Pakistan.  If they can't find a Hamid Kazai[?], um, somebody's got to find a Hamid Kazai for them.
L:  Right, or at least a temporary fulfillment of that need, you know, uh, but the problem is, I don't know how much our government believes that anybody will step in there on a temporary basis and be willing to give up the rule when it's time to allow them to put in their own government.
R:  Well, -- 
L:  That's why I think that, yes, you know, we don't need to be in as strong of a force as we have been, but I do believe we're going to need to be involved in it for some time to come.
R:  Uh, I -- I agree, and how does --
