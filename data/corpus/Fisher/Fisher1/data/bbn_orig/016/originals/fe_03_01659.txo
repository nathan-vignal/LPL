L:  Hi, I'm Gail.
R:  Hi, my name's Anne.
L:  Hi, Anne.
R:  Hey, what's going on?
L:  Oh, [NOISE] I'm thinking about this issue.  Um, civil unrest in the Middle East. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, as far as I think they said, do you think peace will ever be obtained?  And I'm going to have to say no, just because the source of all -- [MN] the source of all of this and where it started -- [MN] um, I'm not sure what your particular religious background is, if you even want to share that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, being a Christian myself and studying the Bible and knowing that this whole thing comes from the birthright of Ishmael and Isaac, and the Bible even says that those two will never have peace, but I don't know if it's to the point where, you know, they need to keep blowing each other up.  And, you know, I mean, the way that they're going about it.  Do you remember when they used to just throw rocks?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, sorry, I -- I'm only twenty six so ... [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, well, that was only, like, three years ago.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, it would be on the news and me and my husband would be laughing.  It's like, look, I mean, you know.  Israel would have weapons and, you know, these poor Palestinians would only have like rocks.  Well, now it's like all of a sudden there -- you know, they is like strapped.  You know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- bombs, knives, guns, heavy machinery.  And I- I'm like, man.
R:  Well, what do you think about -- I mean, what do you think about us being the only people who get to decide anything in the world?  Do you think that's fair?
L:  I think that, um -- I know it seems like we stick our nose in a lot of things but I wonder -- and that's my other line which I'm not answering by the way.
R:  Yeah, same here. [NOISE]
L:  But, um, I really feel like if we pulled out of that situation in, um, less than a month's time, Israel will be annihilated.  They are so outnumbered.
R:  You think?  Because they -- I know they have a -- a lot stronger [NOISE] military than any --
L:  Yeah, they- they're stronger.
R:  -- of the other countries down there.
L:  They're stronger.  But what makes them that much more stronger is that we back them up.
R:  Yeah, that's very true.
L:  You know?  And we keep the rest of the p- um, Muslim world, Arab world at bay.  You know --
R:  But do Israel --
L:  -- it's like a localized.  But if we pull out, man, they got it all.  Syria, Lebanon, Beirut, they're all coming after them.
R:  But should Israel even be there?  I mean, we created Israel as a state, we put people there who weren't there to begin with.
L:  And then --
R:  I mean --
L:  You know, like I said, to me, you know, I know modern day politics says, you know, "Yes, they should, no, they shouldn't".  But going back to what I study in the Bible is they have the right to be there and, I mean, I can't argue with that. [NOISE]
R:  Well, wha- what would you say if, ah, we said the native Americans had the right to take back over all our lands here?
L:  I would say they do.  Ask me --
R:  Then we should just all move back to, you know, wherever we came from so --
L:  Um, no.
R:  -- we could let the native Americans have America again?
L:  But, you know, I mean, it's not like moving back to where you came from.  But, you know, it -- it's a fact of, um, just recognizing that, you know?  That you are in -- it's like, you know, let's say a group of us decided to go move to, I don't know, Mexico.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, we're in Mexico now and that's not our native land.  But, you know, they need to recognize us as citizens and we need to recognize that we are in their territory, [NOISE] you know.  And it's -- I'm sure it wouldn't take violence to settle that issue.
R:  Yeah.  I- it just seems really difficult when it all happened so long ago.  I mean, if, yeah, the -- you know, the people from Israel were there a long time ago but there's such a big change in between, so many generations.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So who says that those people really deserve, you know, to come and move other people off their land?  Um, it seems like that's where all the problems come from, that the Palestinians got shoveled off to the ghettos and then, ah, Israel became Israel.
L:  [several inaudible words] enough.  That's definitely the problem with the Palestinians.  But -- an- and, you know, in a way, I mean, it looks like everybody just blames them for doing -- doing this, doing this, doing this.  But, you know, lately I've read in the paper like where, [LIPSMACK] Israel does stuff, you know, militarily, and I'm like, okay, what was the point of that?  You know, like, I think the other day I read that they moved their tanks in on some, um, settlement over there.  Ended up killing like fifteen people, a couple young, young, kids and, you know, and -- and I never did see in the paper why they did it.
R:  Yeah, it seems like they just can't stop fighting and --
L:  And they don't want to.  I don't believe they want to.
R:  Yeah, I -- I think the only hope there would be [NOISE] -- this is -- this is one of my little pet projects that, um, if we could just get them to sort of intermarry [LAUGH] then --
L:  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  -- then everybody would be happy.
L:  You know, that's just what I say.  You know, everybody gets upset when they see biracial couples out.  I'm like, yeah, if everybody intermarries then what you gonna do?  You don't --
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  -- have any choice, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, both -- both families have to go with that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Then they'll deal with it.  But, you know, [MN] just sometimes I tell my husband, "You know what?  I think we should just either surround the whole situation and back off, let 'em duke it out, winner take all, 'cause I'm about sick of them". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like, this is ridiculous.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm about sick of their fighting, you know, and I -- like I was telling some lady at church, I say if women were in power none of this would happen.
R:  You know, I totally agree with that.
L:  None of this would happen.
R:  It does seem like that's --
L:  This is nothing but testosterone.
R:  -- where a lot of the problems come from.
L:  Nothing but testosterone.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] You know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But my n-
R:  Seems like most wars have to do with that.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  I- um, not both but all.  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.
L:  "No, mine is bigger let me show you".  Okay, well, we're over that, you know.  I'm so over that by now.
R:  Yeah, it makes me feel very dis- um, disconnected from the government just 'cause I -- I can't understand why you would have to go to war all the time, you know?  [NOISE] W- wh- why would we make -- why would we make, ah, decisions to, you know, have people I know or people my age go die for something I just don't even care about?  I mean --
L:  Mm, I mean, I understand that this man, you know, soon as somebody says something against him he imprisons them and -- but, you know, how about this, how about we teach the people over there who want to, to rise up against him, you know?  Instead of us doing it, why don't we let the people handle it their selves, those that want to do it?
R:  Yeah.  [MN] Yeah.  And it seems -- I read somewhere that, um, [LIPSMACK] something like eighty five percent of Americans now believe, mistakenly, but they believe that Iraq had something to do with the World Trade Center.  Which it just kind of shocked me 'cause, I mean, I'm not saying they're not bad people but a- but, you know, that wasn't them.  But everything thinks, you know, we're getting them back now for the World Trade Center.  Well, that's not the right people.  It wasn't Saddam Hussein.  Those people -- they wouldn't even like Sadda- -- the -- Osama bin Laden wouldn't like Saddam Hussein because Saddam Hussein doesn't believe in fundamentalist --
L:  No
R:  -- religious practice.
L:  Yeah, there's -- I mean, two different, um, sects and, I mean, you know --
R:  That would be like saying the -- the Pope, ah -- Po- -- the Pope is on the side of, I don't know, a Pentecostal. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  Just --
L:  Kind of not the same thing.
R:  Yeah, they're both Christians but ...
L:  But yeah, kind of not the same thing.  I don't know.  This is -- is, um, tough to say but I know one thing about it, I'm sick of everybody else hating us because of the Middle East.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I mean, that gets old real fast too.  When you go over-
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Georgia.
R:  Oh, me too, I'm in Atlanta.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Snow Mountain.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Up in Snow Mountain.
R:  Yeah, I'm in [several inaudible words] right now.
L:  You know, and -- I mean, you -- it's like you read the news, you hear the paper, more anti American this, more anti American that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, you know, sometimes I just think, "Let's pull all our troops out of every country.  Let us surround --"
R:  Yeah, and you know --
L:  -- our border like, you know, keep people out of our country.  If you don't belong here, deport 'em. [NOISE]
R:  It seemed li- it seemed like everybody was on our side right after September eleventh and now everybody hates us again.
L:  Yeah.  And it's like, okay, so what?  You know, we weren't -- we're not allowed to defend ourselves?  Or, you know, I don't know.  [NOISE] I guess, you know, we were supposed to wait until something happened to us before we acted again.  [NOISE] But, you know, they -- I mean, he seems -- they seem to think they have a strong case with what they just found for his developing weapons of mass destruction, as far as chemicals --
R:  Oh, I haven't read anything about that.
L:  -- and biological. [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, it was a scientist, I think, who had actually buried evidence of the program.  And had actually given, um, a statement to the fact that when [NOISE] Bush told him that he need to destroy his weapons or, you know, get out of town, that basically that speech he gave like forty eight hours before we went over there, and that's when they actually did the destroying of much of the things.  So they set, like, one of the, um, factories or labs on fire and then they buried a lot of stuff.
R:  Yeah, I did hear --
L:  You know.
R:  I've heard a pretty funny joke about, um, about Bush doing that.  They said everybody makes fun of, ah, Bush for being dumb but he, ah, got Saddam Hussein to disarm before he attacked him. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is true.
R:  Like, hey, get rid of all your weapons.  Now I'm going to invade your country.
L:  No, but now it's just a matter of -- it's not really going to be over until we find 'em. [NOISE]
R:  I know.  It doesn't seem like it, does it?
L:  You know, I mean --
R:  Kind of stretching out.
L:  It's just September eleventh.  You real- you never can really stop looking over your shoulder until you find this man.  Unti- --
R:  Well, we still never found him.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, and, you know?  And until they do that, you know, you're never actually going to have the closure you need for that incident, you know, because he's always gonna be out there.  He's like that person who can always just sneak up on you any minute.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.
