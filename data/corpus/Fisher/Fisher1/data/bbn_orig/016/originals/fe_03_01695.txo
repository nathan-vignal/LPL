R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Ah, hi, ah, I'm Anne, um, -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  And your name?
L:  Candice.
R:  Amanda?
L:  Candice.
R:  Panda?
L:  Candice, C.A.N.D.I.C.E.
R:  Oh, Candice.
L:  Candice.  Like candy, but a little bit longer.
R:  Right, right, right.  So what do you think about the topic we're supposed to talk about?
L:  Oh, it, it's definitely a hot topic right now -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is an understatement. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I mean, I, I personally am glad that the US stepped in, um, and I, I just don't know if, if Saddam is really gone.  I don't think he is.
R:  Well, I don't think so either.
L:  I think, you know, I don't think that he was that, um, stupid to, to put himself, you know, in that position, I guess.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  I think he, he's smarter than that.  But I don't know where he would be. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, somebody's hiding him.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Some of these surrounding countries that he's been aiding -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- all this time.
L:  Yep.
R:  And, yes, I think it was a good thing we went over there, and I think it's gonna be quite a while before all that mess is cleaned up.
L:  Right.
R:  And as long as the religious leaders continue to teach the people to hate us, it's not ever gonna be over.
L:  That's true.  I, I agree.
R:  So, I don't know.  I mean, this is something that's been going on for two thousand years.
L:  Right.  How is it -- how is it going to end now?  I don't see that it can.
R:  Well, I don't either.  I haven't -- I mean, I don't know what the answer is.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, I'm -- I think we have done what we needed to do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just hope that we stay there long enough to take care of it.
L:  Right.  And how do you think they -- they'll rebuild or, you know, how do -- how does the rebuilding process begin if in fact they, you know, they do kill Saddam, and, I guess, the top leaders?
R:  Ah, I don't know, you know.  These people kinda act like, oh -- it's very understandable -- teenagers that Mom and Dad kept their thumb on them until they were old enough to get out of the house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they don't really know how to act, so they try everything.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that was the cause of -- most of the cause of the looting.
L:  Yep.
R:  Because, ah, one thing when you call it -- looting is a nice word for stealing.
L:  Mhm.  That's it.
R:  [LAUGH] And, ah, -- but I, I, I don't think we can imagine how poverty stricken most of these people are.
L:  Right.
R:  I, I think the worst slums and whatevers that we have here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, are no comparison.
L:  To what's over there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yep.  I mean, I live, um, about three hours from New Orleans, and, you know, we visit there sometimes, and, um, you know, see part of that -- I'm -- not the majority part, but I can just imagine what it -- what it's like over there.
R:  I can't really even fathom how --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, I mean, I, I think the, the, ah, people where, say, on the border towns, even in Mexico, are in better shape than these people are.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I don't know, we went to El Paso three or four years ago, and the conditions are just horrible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Horrible.  I live just, just south of Nashville.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, I know you go down in some of the -- you know, where you see the homeless people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- under the bridges and this kind of stuff, we have that too, and I think they're in better shape than a lot of the people you see over there.
L:  Yep.  And what about for the children?  Like, I have a seven year old, and I, I have control -- you know, my husband, whenever it was really hot, he just had it on all the time, and you know, we talked about it and I said I'd prefer -- you know, he knows enough that he needs to know about it, and he doesn't need to see any more.  But how to control, you know, what they see and what, I guess teachers tell them, and, you know, kids tell them at school.  So it's kind of a hard subject for them to understand but not get scared, and 'cause, you know, they may not understand that it's away -- that something could happen here, which I know it could --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- but the action right now is over there.  So how do you think, you know -- what kids see?
R:  I, I, I wonder if they really comprehend what's going on, because it's on television and so is so much other --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, crime, punishment, whatever you want to call it, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wars -- war movies, um, desert epics, all this kind of stuff.  I mean, I wonder if they really -- if -- if a seven year old really has a clue as to what's going on.
L:  What's going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause then he started coming home asking, you know, "Put it on, put it on Fox news channel". [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  He wanted to see it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was like, "No, no, we'll watch something else", you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, honey, I really hadn't ain't thought about that.  My children, of course, are grown, and, um, we just got back from visiting our, our children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- over the weekend in -- in Kansas City.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, the youngest one is, like, eleven, and she didn't even mention it.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And I know she's old enough to comprehend -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- what's going on, you know.  In fact, neither one of them did.
L:  Hm.  And how old's the other one?
R:  He's fifteen.
L:  Fifteen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, and, and neither one of them either really, ah, commented on the war one way --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or another.  I didn't really think about it, but it's kinda strange that they didn't.
L:  Right, that they didn't mention it.  Well, you know, with the holidays had other things, um, other things on their minds.
R:  Right.  So ...
L:  But next month my husband and I are taking a cruise, and so, you know, we, um, we booked it of course before the war started, um, so it was just -- it's kind of, you know, that pops up into my mind.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, just travelling, and a cruise is maybe a possi- --
R:  Where you going?
L:  Ah, we're going to Saint Thomas, Saint Martin, and Saint Croix out of Miami.
R:  I have been there, you will love it.
L:  Oh, good. [LAUGH]
R:  Best trip I ever took.
L:  Wow.  That's awesome.
R:  We took -- we did that, um, [LIPSMACK] I believe it was for our, like, fifteenth wedding anniversary.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I've just had my fortieth one.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  About a month ago, so --
L:  Well, congratulations.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, best, best trip we ever took.
L:  Well good, I'm so excited.  Of course we have to fly, you know, we have to fly to Miami, we're leaving out of Miami.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  That's where, that's where we left from.
L:  Yep.  Well, good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm ex- more excited now.
R:  You'll have a really really good time.
L:  Good.
R:  Well now we flew to Kansas City, and the security, um, was -- I went twice, I guess, last year.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it was really tight last year, but it was very relaxed today.
L:  Really?
R:  Very.
L:  Mm.  Interes- 
R:  Coming and going it was.
L:  It was just relaxed?
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, I mean, they still checked everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but, um, they were not -- I don't know if they've quit doing it, but when I had a friend that just went to Michigan and back, and -- now they did search her -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on her trip.  Now, I didn't see them search anybody -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this time.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And last year when I went both times, I mean, they picked people out, you know, like, every tenth or twelfth perf- person in line --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they picked them out to search them, but they didn't do that, I didn't see them do that this time.
L:  Huh.
R:  And, ah, I know, now in Nashville they looked in the trunk of the car.
L:  Oh.
R:  They did not do that in Kansas City.
L:  Not in Kansas City.
R:  Mm.  But when I went last year they didn't look in the car in Nashville and they did in Kansas City, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, maybe it's a random thing.  I don't know.
L:  Maybe so.
R:  I don't know.  But, um, I've flown three or four times since nine one one --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and have not had any problems.
L:  Oh, well good.
R:  We went to the Bahamas, um, in the, ah, in the fall, and, um, it was a piece of cake.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Good.  That's encouraging then.
R:  You shouldn't have any problem --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I wouldn't, I wouldn't think.  Now I'll tell you that and you'll be the ones they'll pick out. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, that's like saying, "Go to this restaurant, it's fabulous", and it -- and you take somebody and everything's terrible.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's just the way it goes.
R:  Oh, me.  But I mean, you know, we have to -- we have to go on with our day
