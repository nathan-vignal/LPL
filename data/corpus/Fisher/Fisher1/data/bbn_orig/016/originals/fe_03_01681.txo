L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  How you doing?
R:  Good.  
L:  My name -- 
R:  How are you?  Huh?
L:  I'm pretty good.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  Where you from?
R:  I am from Japan.
L:  You're from Japan?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You go to school out there?
R:  Wha- -- Could you say it again?
L:  Hello?  Can you hear me?
R:  What? [MN]
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, so what do you -- 
R:  Could you -- could you say it again?
L:  Say what?
R:  Uh, okay.
L:  My fault.  So, what do you think about the whole peace issue in the Middle East? 
R:  Hm, I think we very -- [MN] America is a kind of too pushy.
L:  They're pushy? 
R:  Yeah. [MN] Yes, [several inaudible words] attack isn't bad, but it does not mean [MN] Iraq [inaudible] Iraq people did [MN] these attacks, so, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I mean I think -- I think -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're a little pushy in a way, like, they should kind of let people settle -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their own issues.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the other thing is -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's, like, America operates with their own agenda -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I mean they claim they're freeing the Iraq people but they make all these accusations -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's almost, like, a lot of them are unfounded, like they talk about the weapons of mass destruction -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they've never found them.  It's almost, like, they have their own reasons to go in, so -- I mean I can see where you say that they're pushy, because -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's almost, like, -- it's almost, like, they're forcing their own way -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on everybody else just because they think it's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you think it will be peace?  You think they'll get a peaceful situation out there?
R:  Um, now?  Yes, probably.  The [several inaudible words] would be better way, but, [LAUGH] okay, how about this -- or do you think there are -- hm, it is better way?  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, it is better than [inaudible] you just does nothing?  I mean --
L:  Do I think it's better if they don't do anything? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I mean, I don't know.  I mean, like, the whole government was kind -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the whole government was messed up, but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, it's just the way America went about things.  They could have gone about it a better way.  Whether it would be better off -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, it depends on how they resolve issues.  I mean, it depends on if they force their own government in there -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or how much the Iraqi people are allowed to settle their own issues -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then it depends on if they try to fight serious, because a lot of people talk about problems with Syria, problems with Israel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it's really a lot that has to go on.  I mean, I don't see it being peaceful for a while, simply because if so many issues and countries that that have to be tackled --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause it's -- it's Jordan, Syria -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Iran -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Israel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's a lot of issues over there.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, another issue is, uh, if [MN] there is a dictator.
L:  There's a who?
R:  Dictator, such as [MN] Saddam Hussein -- 
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- in some country, then the US government should do, er, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- free the people, all the countries.  US government should fr- free all the country people from the dictator.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  That is my question.
L:  You're wondering if they are going to? 
R:  For -- for example, North Korea [MN] has a dic- dic- dictator ruler there North Korea -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- so the -- then the US government should free the North Korean people?
L:  Well, hey, that is another issue -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause, if -- like, if they're being choosey, that's why I think that they have their own agenda, like.  They didn't pull Iraq out of a hat if they're not going to attack everyone that has a dictator -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, I mean maybe they will, maybe they just decided to start with Iraq -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, I mean, whether they're going to North Korea remains to be seen.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just that they have a lot of [NOISE] issues with North Korea -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- because, I mean -- 'cause, you know, North Korea made all those threats.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean you think that's going to be -- you think that's going to be next?  I mean what do you think they are going to do next, though?  What do you think the US is going to do next?
R:  Oh.  My question is if someone says [inaudible] "Okay, this is, uh, country to country", so there is [MN] -- North Korea made a threat on the people -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- US or other country.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  And [inaudible] my question is if someone says, "I am going to kill you", does it equal to the mother or threatening is equal to mother, or, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand.  Like, if they say that they're going to do it, is that equal to them doing it.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  And I don't think it is.  I mean, I think it is necessary to protect yourself, but I think you can go over the limit and -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and I mean if you go just attack them like this because they make a threat -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's almost, I don't know, it's kind of borderline 'cause, I mean, it's necessary to protect yourself, but on the other hand they claim that, you know, the US was being threatened and all this, but they never found any weapons.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So it's, like, you know, their claim that they're under threat -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is -- is really questionable now.
R:  Ahah. 
L:  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's -- I mean, that's what I think it looks like.
R:  Yeah.  And [inaudible] --
L:  What do you think will happen with, um, -- 
R:  Ugh.
L:  -- with -- what do you think with happen with Saddam Hussein?  Do you think he's still alive?
R:  What?  Could you say it again? [LAUGH]
L:  Er, do you think that Saddam is still alive? 
R:  Oh, Saddam Hussein?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Uh, it is very weird because, uh, US [MN] -- they said, the US government said that [MN] Saddam Hussein -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- went to the Syria and Syria government said, uh, if the Saddam Hussein came, then they would expi- -- exterm[?] him or something, you know.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Exter- -- uh, get him out of the country.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so, oh, uh, I don't know -- 
L:  I mean do you think -- what do you --
R:  -- [inaudible] where he can go, you know.
L:  Ahah. Well, where do you think he is? 
R:  He -- where he -- he is?  Oh, one hand in the, uh, in Middle East there are lots big desert -- 
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- so, oh, he can go everywhere and that [inaudible] even he -- he does not show his face -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he may be hiding somewhere.
L:  Right.
R:  How about, er, you?  What do you think?
L:  I don't know.  I mean, I think he's still alive somewhere.  I just don't know where.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where at.  I mean, it's a lot of places to go -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- like it- -- there -- it's other places, there's other countries that he could go to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they may not necessarily know that he's there, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean he could be anywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For all you know, he could be in the United States.
R:  Mm, I don't think so bec-  -- 
L:  So, I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  -- I mean not that he -- I mean he -- I'm just saying he could be anywhere, you know what I'm saying? 
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.
L:  I mean they found terrorists all over the place -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people that they claim to be terrorists in a lot of different places, so ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's a big world so there's a lot of places that he could be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean they claim he's got a lot of wealth and everything, so he's probably got the resources to get from one place to another -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if he wanted to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... 
R:  Yeah.  Probably he still has a lot of money.
L:  Yes.  I mean, they say he's got -- he's worth like billions.  He's just got his money -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, invested in other things or -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or under the control of other people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean he's got access to it.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  So he's probably still around.
R:  I think so.
L:  You think Iraq is tied for the terrorists, like al Qaeda?
R:  Yeah, probably.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think so.  Yeah.
L:  So, would you say the US is -- like, I know you said the United States is pushy, but do you think they're right for targeting Iraq?
R:  [SIGH] Okay.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean -- I mean, the way they went about it might be a bad thing, but do you think that they at least had the right intention?
R:  Um, uh, I have a [MN] -- I have a question about their [inaudible] motivation ove- -- about the attack to the Iraq.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Uh, they say that Saddam Hussein cared only their oil.
