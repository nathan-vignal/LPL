R:  Hello
L:  Hi.
R:  Hey.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] I'm Theresa.
R:  I -- l- -- my name's James.
L:  It's nice to --
R:  How are you doing?
L:  Oh, pretty good.
R:  Oh, well, the topic is the Middle East.  
L:  Ye- --
R:  What do you think about it?
L:  [LAUGH] Um, well, actually I guess I'm pretty glad that everything so far has worked out the way that it has.  I don't know about you.
R:  Yeah, well, I still -- like they haven't really found any weapons of mass destruction.  I mean, I kinda --
L:  Well, I just hear- -- oh, go ahead.
R:  Uh, I kind of -- I'm kind of suspicious of the government because sometimes I feel like the media and all that's controlled by rich and powerful people and I wonder sometimes if it wasn't more about the oil than anything else.
L:  Well, I'm sort of on the opposite end of you, I guess, 'cause, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I kind of think that, um, if it was for oil it was mostly for France and Germany's benefit and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Russia, because it seems like they were the ones [NOISE] that had most invested in their time with that --
R:  He's still[?] on the chair.  I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  That's okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, uh, we basically just, um, went in there because I think we thought that if we didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eventually they were gonna try to pull another nine eleven --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on us.
R:  Right, yeah.  I -- I -- I -- I agree with that because I [NOISE] -- I thought about -- I thought about that also and I also thought about [NOISE] too that Korea, uh, maybe got a message by [NOISE] us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going over there taking care of this.
L:  I do too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I totally agree with you with that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I -- I think that --
R:  I --
L:  And Syria did too it looks like.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause now they're saying --
R:  I --
L:  -- that they're turning over some people that they needed to turn over.
R:  Right.  Yeah, 'cause I -- I did think that was a good result that it showed that the United States was willing to go to war, you know, and willing to stand up because I -- I really did think that nine eleven we went too long before we actually took any kind of real action.
L:  Yeah, and I think we're still --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not resolved in Afghanistan really.  We could figure out what's going on with Osama Bin Laden a little better, I think.  But [LAUGH] as far as peace in the Middle East, do you ever think there's gonna be peace over there, or ... 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What's your thoughts on that?
R:  Uh, I don't really think there's gonna ever be peace over there because [NOISE] it -- it's, uh, religious turmoil.  They'd have to be -- it would -- if it did come it would have to be over the next fifteen years.  It would not be quickly, um --
L:  Oh, I agree with you. [LAUGH]
R:  It would -- it hav-  -- yeah, it's gonna have to take some time for people to, um, become more informed.  I think that, you know, maybe -- I don't know.  Our presence over there, you know, 'cause see we -- we look at ourselves as having good intentions, but other people in other countries see us as an, uh, as intruders.
L:  I agree with that.  I think they do, um, especially I -- I've had another conversation with someone about this and we were talking about it and just how much -- I don't think we even realise how much they hate us over there until stuff like this happens -- until nine eleven happened really, and then, um, now I've heard that some of these people were like in Mosques and stuff and they heard one of their Clerics talking about hating America and the guy got up and walked out.  The young people were like, "We don't believe this any more", and I think it's gonna have to come to that kind of an understanding before they ever resolve their issues with us.
R:  Right, and a lot of things too is like, uh, France.  I mean, I don't know -- you know, I heard from a lot of people that they're [NOISE] jealous of the United States.  There's a lot of jealousy issues with them.
L:  I wouldn't doubt that and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's weird because we never even --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- knew that they were jealous of us.  At least, I had no clue, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and then you think about that and -- and I think a lot of times too, um, the Middle Eastern people are afraid that we're gonna come over and just, you know, like what they thought we were gonna do in Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  I think that kinda helped them see, no we just wanted to help these people get free form this idiot dictator and to -- because we knew he was --
R:  Yes --
L:  You know, like --
R:  Right, that wa- -- yeah, what we do, um, as far as, you know, how we handle this will reflect our true intentions, yeah.
L:  That's true.  But I think we've done pretty good so far with -- with kinda holding back and letting them kinda start to take over stuff that belongs to them.  Their police are now, you know, in charge of a lot of the stuff that's going on.  We're just kinda overseeing it all.
R:  Right.
L:  So, let's hope for the rest of the Middle East that at least starts to look towards our favor.
R:  Right, I think that that will do more to reflect the true nature of our intentions as a nation.
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think that we've, um, done pretty good with, um, you know, we didn't even realise this guy's like Hitler.  I don't think we realised the --
R:  Yeah, I didn't realise that either.
L:  Yeah, we didn't know the extent to which he was doing this with all -- I -- I heard he like imprisoned children and stuff like that and it's like, you know, when you really stop and think about it, we didn't really wanna get involved in World War Two at first either and then when it became our business because, you know, Pearl Harbor and all that and then we absolutely had to do something about it 'cause it was our -- our duty to protect ourselves, and a- they -- a lot of people talk about the pre emptive strike and all that and oh, we shouldn't do that.  I think we almost have to now because it's -- we're at a point where we can't not --
R:  Wait until the disaster occurs.
L:  Yeah, we -- yeah, because then it's gonna happen to us and do we really wanna do that?
R:  Right, 'cause we've already been struck any- -- really, you know, we've already been struck in a way, if you think about it.  I mean, all that came, or originated, from the Middle East.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Because their hatred for us was dwelling somewhere in this remote little place and they came over here and then they just destroyed what we had, and tried to at least, and then I believe that a lot of those countries over there are harboring terrorists that they're not talking about.  Even -- I think even Saudi Arabia is big time --
R:  W- --
L:  -- into the mess.
R:  One thing is that really shocked me was that we trained Bin Laden.  I -- I thought that was strange that we -- we trained -- trained him to fight in Afghanistan, is what I heard.
L:  Yeah, probably against the Russians when they had that whole thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- going on with them.
R:  And then he turned on us.  He used our knowledge and every- -- see that's what made, uh, nine one one so bad was that they used our own working knowledge and -- and a- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- against us.  We actually -- it was like t- taking your own fist and -- someone taking your fist and hitting you in your own face with your own fist.  That's what I felt like.
L:  Yeah, I can understand that.
R:  And -- and --
L:  I know, it almost feels like a double edged sword because in one point you're training people to help themselves, as a country.  And I don't doubt that there's still gonna be Iraqi people who hate us.  I mean, and that could come back to haunt us too.  I'm not saying that it won't but, you know, sometimes for the good of what's going on at the moment, I think sometimes you have to absolutely do what is necessary.  And I think that's -- we've even helped Saddam before, if I remember correctly.
R:  Right, yep.
L:  And just different things and when it served our purpose we did what we had to do, you know.  I think that's true with any country though and I don't ever see that changing with anybody.
R:  No, that's -- it's, you know, you know, people are gonna serve their interests, but we are a f- -- pretty much a fair country --
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  -- and we -- matter of fact I think our nai- -- we're kinda nai- -- we're naive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in that we thought that we were creating goodwill but a lot of the times people really just don't -- they don't know that we've done good 'cause they lie to the people, like you said earlier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They send out negative messages and the people are being influenced by their media, which is not an honest -- honest m- media.
L:  We know that's true 'cause the day they pulled that statue down they were saying, "We saw Saddam Hussein", you know [LAUGH].  And I'm like, "Give me a break people", you know [LAUGH].  I think they never tell their people the truth.  I don't ever see it happening.  I think if there's some way we can bootleg it in there, maybe it'll be a different place.
R:  Right.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Like, uh, radio free Europe and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, sort of kinda stuff like where they can get true -- true facts.
L:  Yeah, I agree with you there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think you have to be --
R:  Where are you located at?
L:  I'm in Ohio.  Where you at?
R:  In Columbia, South Carolina.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I can tell.
R:  Is this your third -- third call, or your first.
L:  This is my third.
R:  Really?  Does that mean -- does that mean we're finished?
L:  I don't know.  I heard they -- they actually do it sometimes even more, so [LAUGH].  You like doing it?
R:  Yeah, I do.  I -- I really l- --
L:  It's fun.
R:  -- I've gotten -- Yeah, it is fun talking to people from all over the -- the country and everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and getting ideas and stuff and I'm sure it helps them, whatever they're doing, you know, learning from this.
L:  Hey, it worked for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Now, um, did you call in and, i- -- or -- or did you just get the call automatic?
L:  I got a call.
R:  Well, 'cause you can call in when you get your, um, password.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  'Cause I ca- -- I called in this time 'cause I wanted to get my third call out the way --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to see if I get -- to see if I get the money.
L:  Yeah, there you go. [LAUGH]
R:  Have you -- have you got -- have you got any money yet?
L:  Mm mm.
R:  Well, it's supposed to b- --
L:  No, but it's been fun, so [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, even if we don't get it, it was fun, but --
L:  Lots of --
R:  And plus you get a chance to win a thousand dollars.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- how'd you find out about it?
L:  One of my friends on the internet told me.
R:  Yeah, they get a dollar for referring you.  Did you --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- know that?
L:  Well --
R:  Yeah.  If you refer ten people, you get te- -- you get ten dollars, plus you get a bonus once you get ten people --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  You get a bonus of five dollars for -- that means fifteen people --
L:  Mm.
