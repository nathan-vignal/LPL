R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, hi.  My name is Colin Chericho.
R:  Ah, hi, I'm Joan Erseck.
L:  Joan?
R:  Joan.
L:  Joan, how're you?
R:  I'm good, how're you? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm doing great.  I, ah, think I got all th- -- I -- I couldn't understand the first category or couldn't hear it and then I -- I heard the part about, um, [LIPSMACK] should the United States be involved in the peace process and will peace ever, ah, break out in the area.  Do y-
R:  Right.  I- it- it's supposed to be on, um, [SIGH] peace in general in the Middle East.
L:  Peace in general in the Middle East.
R:  You know, will there ever be peace, ah, should the United States be involved.
L:  Okay.  Well, I think, ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- before we begin any lengthy discussion on this, ah, I -- I guess what do they mean by peace?  What do y- you know, like, I mean, I guess we have to agree on a kind of a working definition of it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or at least --
R:  Yo- you're right.  That's a -- a good, um, comment.  [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] you know, honestly, I don't think there ever will be peace so it's hard to define what it is, [LAUGH] [SIGH] you know?
L:  You don't think there can ever be peace?  Well, all right, let's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] If we, ah -- i- if --
R:  [SIGH] I mean, if -- if -- if -- if peace being people disagreeing and, ah, taking action because they disagree then, um, I think there will always be disagreement. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Well, I agree that there's always go- -- [LAUGH] all right, I think we can agree --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that there'll always be +disagreements between people.  How about -- I mean, a- and you know what I mean.  But i- it's a difficult thing because, I mean, the question they ask i- is so open ended.  I mean, I -- I, you know -- I mean, the world is not going to become a perfect place --
R:  Correct.
L:  -- you know, depending on an agreement, you know , that -- o- or, you know, some kind of peace treaty that's signed.  [MN] Um, but i- i- if -- I- I'd be interested, you know, maybe if we could start from the point of view of like will there, you know, no active wars meaning, ah, invasions, ah, you know, of --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- of other countries.  And -- and, you know, greatly diminish -- like, all right, for example, I would not say that there's peace in the Palestine Israel.  Now, whether there's a war going on there or not, you know, there's -- there's fairly regular violence, you know, and people dying.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  So, ah --
R:  So, i- if we can agree that peace means no violence, how about -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, I mean, no -- you know, there's still going to be robberies and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, [MN] right.  I meant, ah --
L:  Yeah, right, okay.  All right, yeah we're talking about, like, no --
R:  Terrorism.
L:  Yes, all right.  There we go.  All right.  Um, well, you know, I mean, I don't know.  I mean, [MN] I think as long as people are taught that, you know, it's acceptable to kill, [NOISE] you know, because you're, ah, because you feel you have a grievance, um, then I think, you know, I think you're right.  I think that -- that -- that the- there's a strain of thought and it's not just in the Middle East, um, but it's -- i- it's very strong there and it's -- it's active in other parts of the world, that, you know, when you disagree with someone, when you feel like you've been treated shabbily by them, i- it's okay to kill their, you know, women and children.  Um, you know, then we're going to have a hard time.  And, ah, I -- I don't know if that situation's going to improve.  That being said, [MN] um, I think democracy -- ah, certainly we don't get along --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, we don't all get along here --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in this country.  But -- or in democracies in general.  But there's -- there's more of a [MN] -- there's a less of a -- a willingness to go to violence, um, in order to work out those disagreements.  Um, clearly it's been done but -- maybe you've heard this that, like, there's no, ah -- there's no recorded instance of, ah, democracies going to war with each other?  I don't know if that's absolutely accurate but that's the theory.  And it's -- it's interesting to think about 'cause it's -- it's at least on the surface true.  [MN] Um, and then I think that's the -- that's the, you know, the biggest hope for the -- for us in the Middle East.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I- I'm -- I'm not sure how to comment on that.  Um, you know --
L:  Just let it ride.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Let it ride.
R:  No, no.  I'm -- I'm thinking, do I go into, ah, [SIGH] ah, historical inaccuracies in this statement, such as w- we're not a democracy.  We're a -- a republic because we vote for representative government.
L:  Okay, fair enough.
R:  And -- and secondly, you could say that Hitler was elected, so --
L:  Ah, he was.
R:  -- you know, it isn't like -- it was the same type system that we have now.
L:  Well --
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, true enough, but Hitler was elected.  Hitler was elected.
R:  R -- right.
L:  But at the time that he launched his invasion it was not a democr- -- ah, it was not a representative government.
R:  Right.
L:  I- it was an autocracy or a, you know, a oligarchy or whatever they call it.
R:  And, um, well, I guess in my household, I could stay that about the United States right now, [LAUGH] since our rights are being taken away constantly and, um, you know, because of, um, [SIGH] the government says because of people are afraid.  I'm not afraid of anything.  [SIGH] I mean, I don't really think someone's going to, ah, have a bomb, um, in their purse at a baseball game and so --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I'm mo-
R:  You know, I mean, I'm just using that as an example.
L:  Well, I agree with you on that.  I think -- 
R:  You know and so when --
L:  I think a lot of these things are crazy.
R:  When these, you know, when I get searched, um, I think my rights have been, um, voided and have been voided without an electoral process, um, you know, more by our dictator in power right now.  But anyhow, let's back to the Middle East. [LAUGH]
L:  Let's get back to it, let's get back to it.  Well, i- if -- l- let me just [several inaudible words] is that I agree with you on the issue of, you know, that certain of these rights are being done.  But the problem is, you know, there's no dictator in power.  That wa- -- you know, there were elections, these are elected -- we don't like the decisions that our government does but the fact is --
R:  Right.
L:  You know --
R:  Um, I -- I --
L:  -- in [NOISE] -- in two years or f- -- one year you can elect someone else and --
R:  I sure hope so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of course, ah, you know, well, my husband would joke that, ah, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was a -- a -- a coup through, um, a brother in Florida. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah, you kn- -- you know what?  You tell your husband to get over it.  He's got to -- he's got to -- got to grow up.  All right.
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  Now, let's get back to the Middle East --
R:  Middle East. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and solve their problems, all right?  So, you think, um --
R:  Um, you know, I --
L:  Do you Arab Israelis -- do you think, ah ...?
R:  [MN] I don't think there will ever be peace.  Um, well, let's say in my lifetime.  Um, I -- I could hope for it, ah, but, you know, [MN] you go back to the Middle Ages, I mean, the reason, you know, w- we say they were knights in, ah, honor and all this.  I mean, what we were invading and killing were, um, you know, [LAUGH] Arabs.  Um, and so, you know, they have always been picked on and, um --
L:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What happened l- l- -- you know, since you're big on historical accuracy, w- w- -- the people that took over the holy land, h- how did that happen?
R:  At what time period?
L:  D- d -- did it happen through, ah, peaceful m- maneuver?  Did those Muslims just take over nice and peacefully?
R:  Ah, they lived there first.  The Romans took over.
L:  Exactly.  Bu-
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But in that area those people throughout the Middle East, throughout those -- the area, you know, Syria, Lebanon, ah, [MN] wha- what's now Israel, right, they were Christians for a while.  For a long time, right?  So, I mean, w- we don't have to say everything that, you know, that the Crusaders did w- was, you know, correct.  I'm not going to defend them in all ways.
R:  Mhm.
L:  All right, I'm not going to defend them even in many ways.  But the fact was that was not about walking in and taking over.  Tha- that was fighting against, you know, warlike people that had slaughtered.  I- it was a defensive struggle there.  It was a defensive, ah, well, whatever.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is the thing.  Wh- what do you think is the biggest obstacle to Middle East peace?  [MN] Since you don't think it's going to happen, wh- what's your primary reason for thinking so?  [LIPSMACK] Do you think it's western involvement or conditions in the Middle East, ah, separate from?
R:  Ah, [SIGH] you know, I -- after World War Two I think it was a quick solution to try to, um, form a country to solve the Jewish issue.  Um, I'm just using that term I don't necessarily mean, you know.
L:  Sure, sure, sure.  I know what you're saying.
R:  And, um, you know, so, say it was your home and your thing and all of a sudden it was -- because of actions somewhere else in the world and all of a sudden you had to give up your -- you know, your home in suburbia.  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  I -- I live in the city.
R:  I- I'm just using that, you know.
L:  Oh, okay, all right.
R:  I mean, so say you lived in the Palestinian region and because of, um, Jews getting killed in Germany, [LAUGH] Poland, etc, um, you know, you had to give up your home.  And so, yes, it's fifty years later, um, you know, but there's still hurt feelings about it and --
L:  Well, absolutely, absolutely.
R:  They -- they didn't get to --
L:  But, you know, I mean --
R:  They didn't get to make the decision.  It was their home, it wasn't -- it was taken over from them.
L:  But do- -- I mean -- I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- th- th- th- these are -- they're -- now look, I'm not here to defend all Israel and --
R:  No, and -- and, you know --
L:  -- all it's way too.  No, no, but --
R:  -- I would think --
L:  But what about the -- I mean, you know, a lot of those Pales
