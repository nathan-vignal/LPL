L:  Hi, my name is Donna Dawson and I live in Cleveland, Ohio.
R:  Hi, I'm Barb Gaylord and I live in North Hampton, Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay, we're not too far away.  So, what do you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] -- what do you think about what's going on over there with the war in Iraq?
R:  Ah, well, um, I- I'm a little undecided about it.  I'm glad that it's, um, you know, winding down.  I -- it seems that way anyway.  Um, I'm just, you know, I -- I don't know if there's ever going to be peace there.  It seems like there's always going to be problems there.  I don't know though.  How about you?
L:  [MN] Well, I'm glad that it's winding down too.  It lasted longer than I thought.  But I definitely think there will be peace but I think it'll take some doing.  I mean, because after Saddam Hussein that's all they know and they'll have to get a whole new form of government.  But I still think there'll always be some people over there who will resent us.
R:  Right, right.  I agree there.
L:  Ri- right.  Did you think it would take this long?
R:  I thought -- I -- I actually thought it would be longer.
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah.  I di- -- I didn't think it was [NOISE] -- the way they were talking it sounded like it was going to be, um, a longer thing.  But I don't know.  It's -- I don't know if it's -- they haven't officially said that it's over though, correct?
L:  Right.  There's still some fighting from what I understand --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going on over there a little bit.
R:  You say you didn't really think it was going to last this long?
L:  No.  Actually my husband and I both thought that we would come -- go in there and we would scare 'em and they would kind of realize that we meant business and then give up.
R:  Right.
L:  But I didn't realize that they -- you know, that they would offer that much resistance.  I mean, they were -- obviously there are a lot of people who think Saddam is almost God.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Do you think he's dead?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I've been watching the news today and -- and they're sounding more and more like, you know, it- it's a possibility he's still around and just hiding somewhere so, [NOISE] I mean, it could -- I mean, I -- I hope that he is.  I know it's a terrible thing to say but, um, I don't know if he is.  I mean, do you?
L:  Well, you know, I did at first.  And then I th- -- kind of thought to myself, "Wouldn't this be just like him to make everybody think he is and then all of a sudden think that we've won and everything is going our way, and then they come back and get us when our resistance is down?"
R:  Exactly.  That's what I'm thinking too.  [NOISE] I'm -- I -- I just -- unless they have, like, proof that he's dead, I am not going to believe he's dead, you know what I mean?  I hope that he is but -- a- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it seems like he would be if their intelligence is right but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, it's hard to tell.  So ...
L:  I mean, h- h- h- he's a cl- -- he's a clever man.  I -- I -- I -- I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it seems to me we thought there was all those ch- -- that chemical weapons and warfare over there and we haven't found anything there and that's what baffles me.  If we were so sure there was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- why haven't we found it?
R:  Yeah, where is it, exactly.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, ah, that's what I'm wondering if maybe that's what he thinks, "Aha, I'll use that on you".
R:  Right, right.  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  [MN] So, do you think that -- I mean, if we settle this over here then there's going to be other countries that are going to feel the same as Saddam and then we'll have to go to war with them?  Or it's going to end here?
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know.  I -- I think there's, like, a lot [NOISE] of, um -- [NOISE] I'm sorry.  There's like a lot of unrest out there so I don't what's -- what's, um, [NOISE] going to happen.  I don't know, it's hard to say.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this whole thing for me started with nine eleven and I never thought anything like this would happen during my lifetime.  I don't think anybody did.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, before there was, um, Osama Bin Laden and that war and now there's this.  And it just leads me to think there might be more and maybe this is just going to keep going.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I wish -- yeah, there's l- -- i- it seems like it's g- -- that's the case.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To me anyway.  It -- [NOISE] it's like if it's not one pers- -- um, if it's not one country it's going to be another one or -- or if it's gon- -- it's just going to be cells of terrorists and -- I don't know, it's pretty scary.
L:  Yeah, 'cause they said these terrorists --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- there's bands of them in all these other countries, so that's what makes me think that, okay, so you get one country settled and you're just going to have to keep going on.  I mean, then what's the answer?
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  I don't know.  I just -- I mean, just think about it though.  If it were our country and we were being bombed and innocent people being killed, even though this other country was stepping in for us, I don't know if I'd feel that this other country was my friend if they killed my children.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I can understand that.  You're right, I guess I have mixed feelings too.
R:  Yeah, I -- i- it's, you know, like, I don't think anybody wants a war, you know.  But I think it's all a matter of, like, you know, how much you're going to put up with until, you know, until you're just going to lose it and -- and you're going to have to get rid of the bad guy or, you know, try to anyway.  Yeah.
L:  Doesn't it strike you though, for our generation as sophisticated as what we're supposed to me, that we're still going out there killing the bad guy?  I mean, like, cowboys, you know what I mean?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't believe that we still do that to settle ...
R:  I know.  I know it seems barbaric, it does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know.
L:  Th- that's something they did World War One, World War Two, but not now.
R:  Yeah, mm.
L:  I don't know, it just -- very, very sad.  I was just so happy when the -- the prisoners were all released, because I think we all thought they were going to be dead.
R:  [MN] I know.  That was the best, wasn't it?
L:  Mhm, yes.
R:  Um, yeah, I -- I was just, like -- well -- well, the one girl -- I mean, I thought that was the miracle itself --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause she was all by herself and then they said that there was oth- -- but those other -- like, five of those other people that were rescued too, they were with her, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  So, I mean, I thought, "Oh my God, you know, they only found her, what about the rest of 'em?"  But then, you know, that's -- yeah, that was really good.  That's one nice thing that came out of this.
L:  Did you -- did you happen to hear how these people are mentally, if they're okay or ...?  I mean, I haven't heard too much on that.
R:  Yeah, I really haven't either.  Um, I heard that the o- -- the one woman, the black woman, Sh- -- I think her name is Shoshana --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Johnson.  I heard that, um, when they found out like -- I guess after, like, they captured 'em and they found out she was a woman, she said that they treated her really well.  They, you know, they didn't seem to bother her too much.  But, um --
L:  Well, they do kind of hold women in high regard over there, don't they?
R:  I -- ah, I -- I think so.  I think -- well, I don't know.
L:  Although they're not allowed to do a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  Do anything, yeah, exactly.  I was just going to say, you know, they're not allowed to do anything and they have to hide their faces all the time but -- [LAUGH] So, I don't know.  But, um -- but I don't, as far as the other guys I don't know, but I thought it was kind of weird how when they were on -- you know, they showed that video?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, of them being c- -- they looked like they were terrified, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And -- and I'm sure that they would be.  But it -- I -- I don't know.  It seems like they're all happy an- -- maybe they're just happy to be out right now and don't want to have to deal with everything that happened to 'em then.  I don't know.
L:  And all those bodies they found.  Where were they from?  [several inaudible words]
R:  Yep, yeah.
L:  Ooh.
R:  I don't -- yeah, it- it's sad.  I can't imagine like, you know, all the parents and young wives and stuff, like, to have people out there.  It's got to be a scary thing, not knowing.
L:  I know.  [MN] My husband and I were talking and we wonder if stuff like this keeps on if they'll bring the draft back and young men, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because nobody's going to wanna -- wanna go over there.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  You know, my nephew, um, he, ah -- he's going to be graduating from high school this year but before all this started he was -- he, um, was recruited by the army.  And -- and, you know, they gave him this big bonus, you know, fourteen thousand dollars --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, when you join now.  And -- and now he's, you know, having second thoughts about it.  And, like, [MN] you know, nobody wants him to go in but I don't know if there's anything he can really do to get out of it.
L:  I think once you're signed up, you're signed up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] It just --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH] I mean, you know, all he had to do was just show us where those weapons were, stop it, and all this could have been avoided.  It seems to me he never really loved his country if he was willing to let all these people die.  Because he said in his one speech, "We'll die with dignity".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I don't know either.  I -- I mean, I -- I -- that's -- that's the one thing that's really bothering me too is, like, where are these things, you know?  Um --
L:  Yeah.  That's what I -- I'd like to know, ah, finally.  I mean, this -- that was the whole point why we did this.  I'd like them to find them 'cause if all this ends I don't know -- what was your name again?
R:  Barb.
L:  That's what I thought.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If all this ends, Barb, and we don't find them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are people going to be thinking, "All this for nothing"?
R:  I know.  An- and what's it going to s- say for our country too?  Like, are we going to just go in and, you know ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because people -- you know, like we have weapon of mass destruction, do you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I know this is all, you know, this is kind of different because I think that was a whole part of the first Gulf War was that, um, Saddam -- Saddam Hussein was saying he was- wasn't going to produce weapons of mass destruction and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that was all part of the UN pact or whatever but, um -- or the peace treaty.  And, I don't know.  I -- I just think it's funny that it's okay that, you know, we have 'em but yet --
L:  Yeah, but we -- we expect them not to have 'em?
R:  E- exactly.  [NOISE] I -- I don't get that.  That's what's a little crazy about the whole thing too but --
L:  And then if they don't have 'em, why are they all equipped with gas masks?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, [LAUGH] why would they be issuing them, ah, if they weren't there?
R:  Right.
L:  There's so many conflicts I just don't understand.
R:  Yeah.  Don't you wish you could just go over, you know, be a fly on the wall and find out like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] -- where this guy is and if there really is something, you know, out there that --
L:  Yeah.  And do you think that him and what's his name, Osama?  They are [MN] you know, I mean, related to ea- -- not related physically --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, connected and this is all Al Qaeda and all this?
R:  I don't know, you know.  I'd
