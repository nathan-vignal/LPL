R:  Hi, I'm Steve.
L:  Hi, Steve, I'm Larry.
R:  Hello, Larry.
L:  So, ah, are you, ah, -- have you got a, a, ah, a down pat answer to all these questions they've given us?
R:  They gave a, ah, tumult of questions --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, ah, I don't know, um, I usually, ah, I'm a member of a debate forum, ah, --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- and it's, ah, it's a common subject that we talk about.  Um, [LAUGH] I don't know, ah, I don't know where to start on it.  What do you think?
L:  Well, I think we've pretty much created the problem over there, they, they don't hate our guts because we've been nice to them, and, ah, when you have families that rule countries, and Saudi Arabia's a good example of the house of Sayid[?] over there is worth billions of dollars, most of it not because of oil, it's because of money that we give them so that they will make sure that we get oil.  And the other people that aren't in on this money are kinda upset at us, and, ah, and I think they've been upsad- upset at us for a long time.  And we've done the same thing basically with Egypt, we buy off the royal heir, the, the ruling families, and ah, and leave.  Everybody else goes flat broke.  So, I think they want American influence out, and, ah, they can't declare war on us and invade us, so they, ah, they wind up with a bunch of people that are madder than the other part of the people and they come over here and fly into our buildings.
R:  [LAUGH] You seem more informed than just about everyone that I've talked to on this subject.  That, ah, --
L:  Oh, I've been --
R:  That's just -- oh, [SIGH] that's kinda refreshing.
L:  Well that's good.
R:  Um, most of what I hear around here's, you know, some -- some sort of patriotic diatribe about how we're ridding the world of evil and how we're --
L:  Well we --
R:  -- and how we're, a, how we're a mor- a super moral America.  I mean, it's, it's okay to be -- you know, to do good things like that, but yeah, I think they are upset about, ah, our imperialism.
L:  The peop- the people of America are no more righteous than the people of any other country.  They are all about the same.  It's a very small ruling, elitist, money banker clique that rules any and each country, and America has been keeping little countries in line for years and years and years by buying their elitists.  That's what foreign aid is. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  I think that's, ah, probably what we're doing here, is there's, ah, I don't know, an instability in oil prices from, ah, from terrorism, which, ah, [SIGH] we can't put our oil supplier or oil bandwidth in jeopardy, so I guess that's worth, ah, some people's lives to go over there and set up a, ah, a new government that will sell us oil at a cheaper price, and, ah, give us stability in that market, if we can't get it from whoever the current leaders are.
L:  Well, we, we did punch a bully in the nose, and I'm always happy to see a bully get punched in the nose, but other countries are happy to see a bully get punched in the nose too.  And it happened to be us and they did it to the Trade Center.  And that's a sad --
R:  Well they --
L:  -- that's a sad commentary.  They can't punch the way we do, so they have to be sneaky about it. [LAUGH] But we bully with money.
R:  I agree.  I agree.  We've got a, ah, we've got a lot of weight to throw around, and, ah, I'm not sure that the problems will ever be resolved, although as much, ah, quote unquote headways we're making with the, ah, [LAUGH] liberation of these different countries, um, it seems we go pick off the Middle Eastern countries one by one and set things, ah, set up US governments there, ah, will likely, you know, kill our own wars, and, ah, --
L:  Puppet government, puppet government, puppet governments. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everywhere.  If we can set up --
L:  Or the United Nations.
R:  -- enough of them.
L:  I, I, ah, --
R:  Or the United Nations, is that what you said? 
L:  Yeah, the United Nations is just a, a bunch of crummy stupid countries that -- that two thirds of which are on our foreign money bail out scheme anyway, so that's --
R:  Yeah, I think, ah, a, ah, did -- a, ah, billion dollar developer, Zachendorf --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- built the UN building, and, ah, seventy, ah, per cent of the funding for the UN comes from the US, and, ah, I heard that there's some rumor that, ah, ah, it -- surely it's a joke that, ah, the US wants to form it's own UN [LAUGH] and call it the UN two -- 
L:  Well --
R:  -- where the cabinet is the chief members.
L:  If we did what we were supposed to every screaming bloody liberal in the whole world would say we were becoming isolationist.  What we should do is say, "We'd be willing to talk to you about anything you want to, but, ah, from now on, ah, the building is ours, our money is ours, you can do whatever you want to, please stay in touch", then they would call us isolationist, even though we have the largest adversarial staff in the world and we do more commerce with other countries than all the other countries in the world combined, they would still try and label us as becoming isolationist, and that's exactly what we should do.  Let the am- ambassadors take care of it, and let our business people take care of it.
R:  Yeah, we could sustain ourselves for a while, I'm not sure how long, but, ah, I'm -- I agree.  I think trade would, ah, would still go on and resume, and --
L:  Of course it would.
R:  -- I, I think the almighty dollar would, ah, overpower their, ah, their hatred.
L:  Tr- -- tr- -- try this for, for a theory, if not fact.  In nineteen thirteen we came up with the federal reserve system which is neither federal, nor has there ever been any reserves.
R:  Right, it's a private bank and it's, ah, run by --
L:  It's a bunch of inter- international private bankers.
R:  Yeah, it's called the, ah -- it's, ah, it has another secret organization called the IMF whose members we're not, ah, aware of, and, ah, are privately elected, and control, ah, the world markets.
L:  Right.  Every country has a similar system, the treasury department bil- ah, prints treasury notes, they sell the tre- the feds sell the treasury notes and they sell them, sell them to whoever wants to buy them and loan the money, loan the money out and they keep all the interest.  And if a little country doesn't do everything they're supposed to, they loan them money until they start doing what they're supposed to.  And if the little country can't pay it back again, then they, ah, tell the little country, "Well, here's some more money, as long as we keep our interest, ah, we're doing fine".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, do you think it'll, ah, -- we'll ever get an end to, ah, the war?
L:  Um, --
R:  Or do you see ongoing wars?
L:  No, I think there will be well planned continuous wars for the rest of mankind's time on earth.  I think most of them have planned -- been planned by the -- basically the same family of people, and I think until they're exposed it will continue to happen.  And there's not a thing we can do about it because if you vote for a Republican or vote for a Democrat, they're both being controlled by the same group of people.  They're the ones in upper pincer, the other one is a lower pincer, and we're in the middle being pinched.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So teach your kids that this is a republic and it has a constitution, and the federal government has no authority to give or loan money to anybody.
R:  It's funny, ah, that most people think that this is, ah, a democracy, and I agree, I'd say, ah, that both, ah, both Democrats and Republicans do serve the same master, and, ah, --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- it's, it's very upsetting to learn what, ah, what little we can do about it and how complacent we are in our own lives, just as Americans, to sit home and watch TV and buy the latest products and see what comes on --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- I mean, what we're complaining about is our sitcoms while the rest of the world is complaining about where their next meal's coming from.  And, ah, --
L:  I don't watch sitcoms, but I understand.
R:  Yeah, and the entire time, you know, we get to subjugate other countries and hold them under, ah, you know, economic duress, and see who we can bully and see if we can stay on top and control all the resour- resources.  It's a -- it's interesting.  Would you rather live in another country, like, ah, if you had the option?
L:  Absolutely not.
R:  So, um, see -- do you agree with, ah, with our actions?  Maybe not our, ah, our reasoning, or maybe not what we say we're doing it for, but do you agree with, ah, us going to -- planning all these little strategic wars and going after oil and resources?
L:  Um, I think that America has enough oil reserves to last us for another thirty, forty -- or forty years, and after that oil will be a -- something that you tell your kids we used to use.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There is enough oil in the north slope to keep this country going with sweet good oil for a long time, and it's not a pit person that's afraid of insulting a Caribou that's keeping us from pumping it.
R:  [LAUGH] What do you think's keeping it from us?  Do we want to consume the mid east's oil supply?  First?
L:  Well, no, we have those countries in control, and we control them by buying their product.  And I don't think that's the, the complete picture to it, but I have a -- the -- I spent some time in Alaska and I know Caribous aren't much different than a cow is, and cows don't mind watching people saw logs or set topers[?] or anything else, they're pretty aloof to the whole thing, but there's a, there's a bunch of land up there that the feds illegally owned, and it's called a, a -- I forget what it's called
