L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  This is Laura.
R:  Laura, hi.  This is Edetia[?].
L:  Hi, Edetia.  How are you tonight?
R:  I'm well.  How about you?
L:  Oh, I'm good.
R:  [MN]
L:  I can't believe they have -- they called on Easter though, it surprised me.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH] Guess they're trying to get all their calls in.
R:  Defin- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Okay, so we're supposed to talk about airforce security tonight, huh?
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  How many other topics have you had?
R:  Um, this is actually my first call.
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Yes.
L:  This is my third one. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] so you only get three, right?  I think.
L:  Well, it -- you know, I was reading on the thing and it's like -- I don't know.  It's like I think there's three, but then there's like -- they said, "Are you willing to --" 
R:  Option of getting more.
L:  "-- take more?"
R:  Right.
L:  So, I have no idea.  I guess I'll find out if I get another one after I talk to you. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, so -- so, do you think that the airforce security helps lessen terrorist attacks?
R:  Um, yes and no.  Uh, I guess terrorist attacks in this case they -- they mean by, you know, hijacking airplanes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, et cetera, but I always felt that, you know, if -- if someone wants to do it then they'll find a way around it, um, in any case, uh, it just makes it a little bit more harder, maybe a little bit more costly for terrorist, um, if they're funded well then, you know, what's to stop them from getting their own plane and doing the same thing? 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I was actually, um -- I had been to the airport a- about a month ago, um, and, you know, I got searched and everything like that and the searchers -- searchers are pretty thorough, so, um, I'm not worried about people trying to sneak, uh, past, you know, with anything metal but then again, you know, there's -- there's plastic, um, you know -- people can make guns out of plastic.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things like that could easily get by, um, so I think the -- the best way to -- for something like this to -- to be under control would be just more heightened awareness by people in general.
L:  That's a -- I would -- I would definitely agree with you on that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because there are a l- -- I mean, and I -- and I do have to say though that the security though -- we, you know, as civilians we really have no idea how many things have been caught, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that are just not advertised.  I have, uh -- I have several friends who are pilots in the civilian air world and then also pilots in the military world --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it -- it really is amazing how much -- that it's just, you know, it's -- because they don't want to scare everybody to death --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that they'll never fly again.  You know the stuff just isn't advertised.  It's like, "Oh, they've taken care of it" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know and that type deal.
R:  Everything is always ri- put under, you know.
L:  Right, and so I mean I d- -- I do think it helps but I'm -- I would also have to agree with you that, you know, there's just so many times that people continually try and try and try --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that eventually --
R:  Something happens and gets through.
L:  That's it.  Yeah --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- eventually something will happen and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- get through.  And I think it's -- you know, I think, you know, we're so much more aware now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than we were before.
R:  Right.
L:  You know and I think that makes all the difference in the world.  You know, you talk to people who fly nowadays and, I mean, you know they're really more aware of their --
R:  Right --
L:  -- surroundings.
R:  -- I mean, n- no one's like, you know, always -- it's not always good just to mind your own business.  I mean, uh, some sense of awareness is definitely necessary.
L:  Exactly, whereas you know before on an airplane it would just be like, you know, "Oh, who cares?"
R:  Whatever, --
L:  I used to --
R:  -- yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.  I used to travel a lot and I would --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- never speak to anybody, I could be asleep before we even taxied, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then I would sleep all the way until we got at the gate, you know.  I don't do that so much --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- any more. [LAUGH] You know.  So, uh, you know, I -- but I mean I do think -- I do think that it -- that it helps but I don't think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that we can protect ourselves.
R:  Right, right --
L:  You know.
R:  -- no, I com- -- I completely agree.  I mean, I guess, in a sense like there's a larger issue at hand here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, and that's something that isn't gonna go away any time soon.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, as long as there are su- -- there is such a strong, uh, opposition out there then, you know, they'll find a way.  I mean, this -- this sort of thing has been going on in the Middle East for centuries, you know, you could say.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Uh, you know, it's not --
L:  Yeah, and -- and it's just something we're not used to.
R:  Right.  It's not something new, but it's just something that hasn't, um --
L:  It --
R:  -- so deeply affect us.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's new in our country here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, yeah, we -- we went to Israel a number of years ago and we were amazed that when the kids were on, uh, field trips --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the chaperones had -- had automatic weapons.
R:  Right, I mean it's defin- --
L:  You know -- yeah, you're just --
R:  But --
L:  -- w- and it's like -- course the kids didn't misbehave either.  I -- I thought --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was a form of discipline [LAUGH] you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] but -- but, yes, exactly.  See other countries have just -- they've always lived with this --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it's a way of life.  You know, we've just kinda been very sheltered --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and -- and then of course had a very rude awakening, you know, to what the rest of the world --
R:  Yes, definitely.
L:  -- deals with, you know, on a normal basis.  With that said it drives me absolutely bonkers that they will not let me take my pocketknife on the airplane. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, and -- and little things, I mean, like a pair of scissors --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and like sometimes nail clippers, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they --
L:  I have a girlfriend, she's a pilot for a major airline --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it absolutely drives her nuts.  They are -- she does needlework --
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, when she's on a layover and they're al- constantly taking her needlepoint scissors --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- away. [LAUGH] You know, they're just constantly doing it and it just irritates her to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- no end.
R:  Oh, I can imagine.
L:  You know, she's like, "Do you realise I have a crash axe right behind me in the cockpit --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- if I wanted to do something?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, for a -- a -- exactly, I mean, for pilots and, um, you know people who have to go through it every single day it just -- it must be like, you know, something just -- such a pain I guess to do it, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a necessary evil, nonetheless.
L:  Well, I was reading the thing about, you know, one of the -- the national guard or whoever they are, you know, --
R:  Secret Ser- --
L:  -- who are at the airport.
R:  Secret Service, I -- I --
L:  Ye- and they -- they made them put their gun through the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- x-ray machine.
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Come on, honestly.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Some of the people like -- but, you know then again if s- -- if something -- if a terrorist were to go over there and say he was a Secret Service agent you don't want him to, you know --
L:  Well, --
R:  -- easily get through --
L:  -- be that --
R:  I mean there has to be some kind of --
L:  That's -- that's --
R:  -- check.
L:  -- exactly it.  You know, it's like they're just -- you know, they don't really know that -- you know, you may have ID but they don't know that you're truly a pilot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or that you're -- you know, or that you're anything else that -- that you say you are.
R:  Right.  I mean, y- yeah.
L:  Yeah, I got caught -- oh, just a couple of months ago.  Uh, my husband and I both put the buzzers off and we had two small children with us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they -- and one of them's a two year old girl and they kept telling my daughter, "Don't touch your mother".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm like, "Okay, you guys get a grip on reality here!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know. [LAUGH] "My shoes set off the beeper, take my shoes away" --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  You know.  Oh, yeah --
R:  Boy.
L:  -- it was just my -- I g- -- I had new boots and they had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- buckles on 'em and it set --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- off the beeper and I wasn't smart enough -- now I know, I always take my shoes off now and I just put 'em through the x-ray.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you might as well -- I think I was, um, flying out of Newark airport and they make everybody do that now.
L:  Do they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's just -- it's phenomenal, you know, what -- I mean, it's like you know so by the time you take off your jewellery, you take off your belt, --
R:  I know, and then -- then there's a big backup.
L:  -- you take off your shoes. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I was -- I was actually very surprised, I had set aside about three hours before my flight was to leave for me to like, you know, leave my house, get to the airport and go through all security.  I figured it would take, you know, forever but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it actually -- it went through pretty smoothly.  I mean, yeah, there was a little bit of a delay but it -- you know, five, ten minutes here and there.  It wasn't too bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wasn't that disappointed in --
L:  I really -- I haven't had any major security delays.  I think it was like, you know, probably not too long after September eleventh that I flew --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that was -- let's see at that point I was flying out of San Diego and, uh, I did get caught and -- but that -- and that took like two hours --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- but that was the long- -- but that was the longest one and it's never -- I've never had that problem since.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Do you fly often?
L:  I -- well, I mean, just casual flying.  I mean it-- I mean, to hear me it sounds like I fly a lot, but I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- didn't really think I do --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, uh, you know, I -- I don't know every few months we, you know, might go some place --
R:  Go somewhere, right.
L:  -- or, you know, I might meet a girlfriend for the weekend or something, um, I don't fly too much international any more. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's just like --
R:  Yeah, I haven't left the country since -- for a few years now, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm actually planning on, uh, going up to Canada soon, so I -- I'm interested to see how the, um, security up there across the boarder is working.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I had -- see I haven't crossed any like -- that type of local boarders --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- recently.
R:  I mean, I -- I -- I'm pretty sure it's completely different, um, in terms of getting across the Mexican or Canadian boarder.
L:  Oh, yeah, and unfortunately I'm afraid if you don't look it like a typical caucasian American --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they think of what a typical caucasian American should look like --
R:  Right, I mean, there's definite- -- there's definitely some profiling involved and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I -- I guess, you know, in order to save time in all aspects, I -- I mean it's kind of necessary, but to what point?  You know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- is -- is legal in fact, you know?
L:  Yeah, I know, and I -- and I have to say I feel -- I'm the classic caucasian person, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I can -- I look like everybody else, you know, so I don't have any trouble --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I have to say if I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I was a third or fourth generation, you know, Arab American --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or Middle East American, it -- I mean, even though you know that has to be done --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I would still have a hard time --
R:  It's -- it's still back in your mind.
L:  It would.  I would have a hard time, you know.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, um, I mean I'm Indian and, uh -- but I was born here --
L:  Right, so, yeah --
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  So, you're American.
R:  -- and it's com- -- yeah, it's completely -- and then -- see and then like you go to the airport and then, you know, you get randomly screened, um, and then you wonder -- always in the back of your mind, you know, "Were you randomly chosen, or was --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- there some kind of process?"  So -- so things like that are always gonna stick with you and it's just the way it -- it works.
L:  Yeah, now my husband he's -- he's funny.  He's been randomly caught several times and he's like, "What is it?" you know.  And again he looks like your typical, you know, white guy going through the airport --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- you know, and you know, but -- so, at least he knows that his is random.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know.
R:  But then, there's always the other people who --
L:  Exactly, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I have to say it would ...
