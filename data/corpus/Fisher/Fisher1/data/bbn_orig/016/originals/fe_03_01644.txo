R:  Hi, this is Ben Goodman.
L:  Hi, this is Matt Roberts.
R:  Matt Roberts, how are you? 
L:  Good, how are you doing? 
R:  Good, where are you calling from? 
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia, excellent.
L:  What about you? 
R:  Boston.
L:  Boston.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How about that.
R:  Say again.
L:  How about that.
R:  Oh.  How did you get roped into this Fisher thing?
L:  Oh, it's a great deal, you talk on the phone and get paid.
R:  But, ah, who connected you? 
L:  Um, I go to school at Penn so I saw a flyer for it and signed up.
R:  So, you are currently a student? 
L:  Yes.
R:  Undergrad or grad? 
L:  Undergrad. 
R:  Excellent, what year? 
L:  Senior, I'm graduating in a few weeks.
R:  Oh.  Any, ah, jobs out there?
L:  Oh, God, no, [LAUGH] none at all.
R:  Kind of -- kind of a scary time to be graduating.
L:  Yeah, it is, it's really difficult.  It's frustrating, um, but I'll see what -- you know. [inaudible] 
R:  What are you -- what are you looking to do?
L:  Well, I major in computer science.
R:  Okay.
L:  I thought I would be able to find work with that.  Unfortunately I timed that a little poorly so [LIPSMACK] I hope to, you know, work in, ah, software development, ah, sort of IT and it will be okay.
R:  Where do you want to work? 
L:  Well, I'd like to work in maybe Boston, New York or Philadelphia or possibly Chicago, I'm pretty open, um. 
R:  Okay.
L:  But probably my top -- my top choice would be New York or Philly.
R:  Mhm.  What kind of stuff do you do?
L:  Let's see, I -- I concentrated in graphics and digital media, so, sort of my dream job would be working for a video game company or some sort of, ah, [LIPSMACK] graphics intensive simulation or visualization type software.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, so what about you, what are you gonna do? 
R:  Um, I'm a little bit older, thirty one. 
L:  That's not old. 
R:  But I've been in the tech industry for nine years.
L:  Oh, wow, [inaudible]. 
R:  And, um, I used to work for the New York New Media Association. I've done --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- web development stuff but more from a business side than from a technical side.
L:  That's cool.  I, ah, -- I do a lot of freelance web design and I'd love to work for a design firm or some sort of new media group, ah, multi media.  Of course that's the absolute hardest field to try and find a position in now.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty brutal. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you -- if you're serious about New York you should check out N.Y.N.M.A. dot org.
L:  N.Y.N.M.A.? 
R:  Dot org.
L:  That's the, ah, ... 
R:  New York New Media Association.  
L:  N.Y.M.N. -- [several inaudible words]
R:  New York New Media Association. 
L:  Okay, we'll check that out, there's job postings, mhm? 
R:  Good job postings and, um, lots of events tech specific, um, you know, and it's not -- it's not too bad to trek up there from Philly.
L:  Yeah, I'll have to -- I got -- well, my girlfriend lives there so I -- I go up almost every other weekend.  So, if there's and event I'd love to check it out.
R:  I'm just looking to see find a job, what do they have these days.
L:  I look at like the A.I.G.A., they sometimes have, ah, multi [inaudible] -- I've done freelance, like, print designs and stuff like that too so --
R:  Freelance what design? 
L:  Freelance print and, like, magazine, ad design, things like that.  So, it wouldn't even have to be [NOISE] software based.  I got into -- I got into the computing end of it from a -- from a sort of design standpoint and found this program that let me do -- continue doing design and actually get a fine arts minor -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in conjunction with a computer science degree.  It's pretty cool.
R:  Excellent.
L:  Um, yeah, it's called a -- it's a new -- well, it's about four years old now.  I was -- I was one of the first groups of students to enroll in the program, ah, -- 
R:  Back when it was -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, back when it, back when, ah, --
R:  Back when it looked like there was no end to, ah, --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- demand for this stuff.
L:  Exactly.  I wonder if it's working against me now because it's -- the, ah, program is called digital media design and I think that sort of hides -- well, it's not indicative of the fact that you really are a computer science major.
R:  You are a hard core programmer.
L:  Right, I mean I've done the bulk of my credits in computer science.  I -- I work for a freelance software developer right now.  So, with a title of your -- your degree like that I don't know if it makes it through those automatic sifters from a tech company.  You know, you format it and put it on a website.
R:  You're gonna have to go network.  In this --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- environment people --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- are getting two hundred resumes per job.
L:  Mhm, mhm. 
R:  And the only way you're gonna find something is if you meet the person and, you know, and then they check out a portfolio of your work.
L:  Mhm, yeah. 
R:  It's not gonna be -- I mean, your chances are only thirty per cent that it's gonna come to an online posting.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You've got to get out there, you got to go to the event, you got to schmooze[?]. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ... 
L:  I'm still learning the ropes with that.
R:  So check out N.Y.M.A.  In Boston it's, um, -- have you heard of M.I.M.C.? 
L:  No.
R:  M.I.M.C. dot org.
L:  That's a, ah, new media -- 
R:  Yeah, it's a new media --
L:  -- press group? 
R:  -- organisation.
L:  Dot org, okay.  Um, yeah, I've been looking -- well, I look at -- I look at monster and those kind of workloads and I look at -- there's some crew services work at school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's job postings and that's still a little -- still a little vague.
R:  Especially people don't go to Penn for --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not what they do if you are from finance.
L:  Right, exactly, and --
R:  Have you checked out -- 
L:  I'm sorry, what did you say? 
R:  There's one more association you should check out, it's R.Y.Z.E.
L:  R.I.S.E? 
R:  R.Y.Z.E.
L:  R.Y.Z.E. dot -- com -- 
R:  Dot com.  And it's a -- it's a nationwide network of tech professionals.
L:  Mhm. [MN] So what did you do that you -- you know about all these, these groups?  You worked in -- you said that you worked -- 
R:  I worked at the New York New Media Association.
L:  Right.
R:  I was at the centre of the -- the whirlpool watching everything go down the tank. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That was the one, what, three years ago that was really -- I mean, did you guys start getting inklings of the -- of the way things were going long before it was, you know, front -- front page news or was it something that really shocked you even at some place like -- 
R:  I started there in -- in May of two thousand. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, it was really -- in hindsight it was after the bubble had burst.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, [MN] -- and I was there until March of two thousand and two when, you know, it just looked bleak.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, my entire experience there was sort of watching things.
L:  Wow.
R:  Slowly, you know, slowly decline.
L:  Mhm.  And, ah, what did you do before you went there? 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, before there I was doing web development stuff for, um, a company called The Renegade Marketing, produced Seekrems[?] Coolers dot com --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- amongst other very exciting web sites.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, ah, um, you know, I was at TEFA [inaudible] media so I was doing the agency thing which was just fine but, um, I talked to one client who had endless discussions about shades of pink.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] She decided I needed some --
L:  I guess that's important though when you're talking about wine coolers. it's a real  --
R:  It's very important.
L:  A real science, your, ah, pastels -- 
R:  Berry this versus berry that and God forbid you get the wrong berry because ... this client was so fussy that, you know, when she was sixteen she got a nose job and she wasn't happy with it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so she made -- she went back to the doctor to get them to redo her nose job. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. It's like, ah, ... 
R:  You can imagine she was fun to work for.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, I got out of that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, it -- it can be fun and interesting depending on the projects you get to work on, ah, ... 
L:  Yeah, I -- I wouldn't -- you know, I would love to work for -- I've been looking -- looking at some of these smaller design groups, um, a few in Philadelphia, of course there's a bunch in New York.  It's just very, very difficult.  I mean they want you to intern for no salary for a year before they, you know, would probably even consider a salaried position, um, and pretty much a lot -- there -- there is one firm I interned at really briefly in Philadelphia called One Six Zero Ninety and when I was there they had ten full time employees and twenty interns.
R:  Oh man, that's -- that's just abusive.
L:  It's criminal, yeah.
R:  It's criminal.
L:  And they weren't even -- I mean, and then they would hire somebody and didn't even hire one of their interns.  They hired a full time interactive guy [several inaudible words].  I thought that was really low.  And I was doing interactive work there, it was actually on my fourth day, ah, interning there, I was going in, like, one or two days a week and I saw this new guy, it was, like oh, yeah, he was their new hire for interactive and there were, like, two other interactive guys there who were -- 
R:  Interning.
L:  -- really talented decent interactive guys and they didn't hire them.  They took a -- a -- a guy and he wasn't even that much older, he was, like, twenty five compared to twenty three, twenty two. So ...
R:  [MN]
L:  Yes, I got out of there with that warning sign.
R:  Yeah, yeah, don't -- don't let yourself get abused.
L:  [LAUGH] But I guess that's the only way they are able to produce work, ah, for -- to keep their salaries.
