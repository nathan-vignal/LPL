R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  My --
R:  Hi.  This is -- huh?  Go ahead.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  [LAUGH] This is Alba.
L:  I'm sorry, what was your name? 
R:  Alba.
L:  Alba? 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  Oh, that's a pretty name.  My name is Barbara.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How did you get your name?  
R:  Um, -- 
L:  It's unusual.
R:  -- it means dawn in Spanish, so I guess my mum was on some kind of Spanish kick at the time.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All the rest of my family has, uh, regular names.
L:  Ahah. Um, so, I guess I'll let you start off on our topics.
R:  Mm, the Middle East.  Well, I -- I think it's a shame that we have to send people over there, um, I -- I guess, um, -- I don't know.  I -- I don't really know too much about it, but in general I'd prefer that, uh, we didn't have to send our troops over there to be in danger.
L:  Well, I agree.  I probably would prefer we didn't have to.  I think we did have to.  Do you think we did have to?
R:  Well, we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction but, um, I'm sure that there can be some good that it can come out of it.  Um, I -- it looks like the Iraqis are rather happy that Saddam Hussein is not in power any more, so that looks like one good thing that did come out of it.
L:  That's true. [LAUGH] Now if we can keep the peace.
R:  Yes, that would be good, but I think that's going to be rather difficult.  It looks like there's -- that's just a hot bed of activity right now.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I sure hope we can or -- or that someone can, anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  You didn't have any family that, uh, went over, did you, or did you know any troops who went over?
L:  No, not any.  Do you?
R:  No.  I was just checking and I -- I'm so horrible with names.  I know there was one, um, private that was, um, taken hostage for a while.  Was it Jessica Lynch or am I totally wrong?
L:  Jessica Lynch was -- 
R:  I'm thinking that's the name but, um, one of the -- the -- I was thinking of one of the female prisoners of war.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  [NOISE] And --
L:  And you think she's one of your relatives?
R:  No, no, no, she's not related to me but I had heard a lot about her at the news and, uh, she had gotten her leg broken, so it -- or -- or something, some torture technique being used over there, so -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think there is a little bit more to investigate in the way that, uh, our troops over there have been, um, coming into contact with stuff.
L:  Yes.  I think they don't tell us everything.
R:  That's true.  I guess that's kind of good because sometimes I get worried that, um, maybe they're giving out too much information.  I just have this vision of the Iraqis tuning into CNN and to find out what's going on.
L:  I know.  I've got the same thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And then Geraldo[?], you know, giving away our game plans.
R:  Oh, I didn't know about that.  I'm just so behind on everything.
L:  Well, I don't see too much but that's one of the things I happened to see.  He kneeled down in the sand and was drawing little pictures and everything and -- 
R:  Oh, that's horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's just the kind of thing they don't need to know. 
L:  No.  No.
R:  But from what I know right about now, I think we just -- have we done everything we needed to do, because I -- it looked like the battle part is over, but that's just -- it's like I -- I catch it when I -- it comes on the news.  I don't actively seek out the information on it, [NOISE] so ... it looks -- 
L:  Well, I do about the same thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] But from what I understand, the battle part -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seems to be over but we keep getting more people, you know, more of the high ranking people on that deck of cards that they made.
R:  Oh, yeah, I think that was a great idea.  That was a great idea.
L:  Yeah, I think so too and -- and it seems like every day you hear they got another person out of there.
R:  [NOISE] It's working.  Yeah, I think that would be one thing to do, like take the people in power out and then maybe things will start changing from there because it doesn't seem to be just the general people over there, it's like a- an abuse of power by, um, the ruling party, the whoever's in power.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So do you think --
R:  And -- uh-huh?
L:  Well, one of the things that they said on our little recording was do you think that they'll be able to have peace there.  Does it seem to you that they will?
R:  I don't think so, because it's like [NOISE] there's so much contention over even [NOISE] the land itself and, um, and there's -- there's oil over there, then there's, uh, controversy about the Holy Land and the Jewish and, um, Muslim conflict over there so i- if they do, it's going to take a really long time.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it seems like to me, too, although I hope you and I are both wrong. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that would be great if they can achieve something over there and -- and everyone can come to an agreement and they could achieve some kind of stability at least over there. [NOISE]  If they couldn't get total peace, maybe at least an agreement and some kind of way that they could work together on a common solution.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  This is really hard to talk for ten minutes on a topic, isn't it?
R:  It is.  It is.  Oh, goodness and then it's one that I don't feel like I'm all that knowledgeable about it and I'm sure there's people who have followed it from the beginning and know probably everything there is to know, but I just get bits and pieces.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we- [LAUGH] we're too much alike in that regard.  Um, ...  
R:  But there's been coverage out there right now.  I was in the post office today and I -- I think there were some Iraqis talking about how, um, [NOISE] they were upset to find out how many things Saddam had in his, uh, palace and apparently they were over there struggling and living in poverty and he's drinking out of gold cups.
L:  They didn't know that?
R:  Uh, not according to the CNN report.  They were surprised at [NOISE] -- at what they found because, um, from what I got out of the report, they saw the outside of the palace but they had no idea that it was just so lavish inside -- 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- and all the things they had.
L:  Well, it's good for them to find out.
R:  It is, and it's really a shame when someone [NOISE] just takes all the resources of the country for themselves and has -- the person who's supposed to be ruling has everything and the people have basically nothing.
L:  Mhm, and that's not good.
R:  And hopefully they will find him because, um, from what I last heard they were still looking for him or they weren't sure whether he was dead or not. 
L:  I know.  I sure hope they find him, too.  I don't care if they find him dead or alive, just find him. 
R:  Right.  That will be one of the things I think they will have to do [several inaudible words] kind of take him out of the equation. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  They seem to be getting his family right and left.
R:  Yeah.  I heard that they had gotten his, uh, half brother.  I -- I think that's what I heard, and then I guess everything is cleared up with Afghanistan or [NOISE] maybe even starting to get cleared up because I haven't heard any more about that.
L:  Well, that's good.  Uh, we -- we keep -- I keep forgetting about that because we're so busy thinking about Iraq and then if there are any, uh, you know, does it connect anywhere with, you know, with, uh, al Qaeda and Saddam.
R:  Right.  I think there -- I think there is and I'm hoping that ... it -- it's going to be really terrible if we don't find either Saddam or Osama because [MN] we need to think of the two of them, uh, ganging up in some kind of way.
L:  Mhm.  That's right.  Yeah.
R:  But, um, they have had a long history of conflict over there from what I -- I don't know how long it's been going on but I know I've heard about the suicide bombers even before all the conflict started with, um, Afghanistan and Iraq.
L:  Oh, yeah.  The ones in, um, Israel?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they -- I don't know.  So, not -- and then my geography is horrible, too [LAUGH] so it's kind of hard.  I'm like, "Okay, Middle East.  I know there's Iraq over there and Afghanistan" and, um, -- 
L:  All those places seem like just a hot bed.
R:  Right.
L:  Mm.  That's one place I would never be interested, if I travelled much.  I would not want to go there. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, not -- not on my list of places to go either.
L:  No, it would be too dangerous.
R:  And then I heard they looted the museum there, which that's always a shame because I'm sure they lost a lot of things that were, like, really ancient.
L:  That's really sad, because, gee, where in the world would you find stuff as old as there?
R:  Right.  That was one of the really sad things about it, but, um, I guess they have everything under control.
L:  Well, good, so -- so I guess they stopped em. 
R:  [MN] 
L:  [SIGH] I feel so dumb. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] If I had known [inaudible] I would have read up on it a little bit, like, "Okay, now, I can -- I can talk about this".
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, I got a lady the other day who said, "I don't like this topic" and she hung up.
R:  Hm.
L:  So ... 
R:  But I think we're -- we're ki- -- we're doing a good job.  We're -- I think we're doing everything that can be done and I'm happy to hear that, uh, there weren't any acts of terrorism over here while they were [inaudible] because I was worried about that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of thought that that might pick up during that time.  Fortunately it didn't.
R:  I think we have some good security in place.
L:  I hope so.  Have you done any travelling during this time?
R:  Um, actually no, not during this, er, last one.  I went to -- I flew to Mexico, um, and --
