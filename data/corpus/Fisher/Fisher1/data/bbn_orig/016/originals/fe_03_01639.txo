L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  With whom am I speaking? 
L:  Ah, this is Joan.
R:  Dawn?
L:  Joan.
R:  Oh, Joan.  How are you doing Joan, I'm Joe.
L:  How are you doing? 
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, Ill- Illinois.
R:  Oh, Illinois.
L:  Yep.
R:  Well, what's the topic, about the unrest in the Middle East? 
L:  Yes, that's what -- that's what it's up to.
R:  Well, it seems like they've been having trouble over there as long as I can remember and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  It doesn't seem like anything takes, so I don't know.  How do you feel about it?
L:  I -- I -- I'm kind of in between because it's, you know, I mean, I know it should be done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's, like, why do -- why does it always have to be, you know, the United States going to somebody, you know, helping somebody out.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  It seems like we're involved all over the place. 
L:  Right, right. I mean what is -- what does anybody do for us, like, you know. 
R:  [LAUGH] True.
L:  When there's any problems, you know.
R:  True, true.
L:  Not that they can.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, that's what I feel, that it's kind of -- you know, we're always helping everybody else out, so ...
R:  And we're --
L:  And it would be nice if somebody reciprocates and does it for us.
R:  That's it.  And it seems like with this current situation over there in Iraq and economy being as bad as it is, who knows how long it will be before they rebuild Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  First they're saying, ah, -- well this guy that once is fairly friendly with the, ah, Pentagon, this Iraqi, I forget his name, he says, "Two and a half years", the Pentagon is saying, "Five years now". [NOISE] So, I mean it -- it's, ah, ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the economy the way it is, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, just as long as we don't help them, you know, the United States itself doesn't.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, go in there and say, "Okay, we're -- we're gonna help you" and, you know, yeah, so, you know, you can help in a way but, you know, it's not -- it shouldn't be up to the United States to -- for them to do it.  You know, they want- -- they wanted to get him out ever there, you know.  They should be the ones to, you know, rebuild themselves now that he's, you know, he's out of there.  
R:  Well -- [NOISE]
L:  It shouldn't be up to us.
R:  We're gonna wind up doing most of the work, I believe.
L:  Oh, probably, probably.
R:  Rebuild that and, ah, everybody's suffering over here because of the economy situation.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they still don't have a figure what it's gonna take to do all that work and actually how long it will take.  It's up in the air.  One person says, "Two and a half", another one says, "Five", who knows.
L:  Oh, yeah, you never know.  I mean, you know, they didn't -- I mean, with the war itself, you know, I mean, you know, it could have gone on for a lot longer than it did and, you know, -- 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Thank goodness it really wasn't that long but, I mean, it's still not totally over.
R:  Which is true, which is true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know, I mean, I don't know, I'm somewhere in the middle.  I mean, I could see he was a bad guy, you know, [NOISE] and people are suffering, but, ah, they still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't know if we went over there for that, for oil or for what, I don't know.  Do you Joan?  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I don't under- -- I mean, you know, I don't know why we got involved in it totally, you know, in the first place really, you know. [inaudible]
R:  It's supposed to be over weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Yeah. [several inaudible words]
R:  They still haven't found anything yet.
L:  Yeah. So ...
R:  I mean, I, -- you know, I just don't get it.  I hope, you know, it turns out well but, ah, I have a feeling that as much as we are disliked over there and with the situation over there being what -- what it is, they don't know who they want to run the place now, I feel like we're gonna e- even have more people against us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They sell the Arabs, enough.  Now we are threatening Syria and this and that.
L:  Yeah, you never know.
R:  It's just been sad all over.
L:  Right.
R:  With North Korea, China, all of this, ah.  It seems like we just get out of one thing and into another.
L:  Yeah, I think we should just, you know --
R:  Mind our own business. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly, exactly.  You know, that we have our own country to -- to worry about and let's not worry about anyone else, and, you know, ...
R:  That's right.
L:  But you can't tell 'em that, you know.
R:  I mean Bush gets up there, he's all tied up with the -- the Middle East and he doesn't seem to have a plan how to get us out of this current economic mess.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  How is the weather over there?
L:  Ah, it's not too bad. It's kind of like --
R:  Are you near Chicago?
L:  Yeah, I'm just -- just south of Chi- Chicago.  I'm in the suburbs.
R:  It's not too bad today? 
L:  It's just kind of -- kind of a little bit rainy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But not too bad.
R:  Well, it's a warm front, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You -- 
L:  I mean we --  
R:  You guys have it really cold in the winter, don't you? 
L:  Ah, it depends, some winters we do.
R:  You are used to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I was talking -- 
L:  Some winters it's bad and then other times its, you know, if you, you know, hit fifty or sixty there is, you know, so ... 
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  You never know.
R:  Well, I lived up in Idaho Falls, Idaho, it used to get like twenty below.
L:  Okay.
R:  But it was a dry cold, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  You really didn't feel it that much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is this your first time on this, ah, what's it called, Fisher linguistic thing? 
L:  Oh, this is my second call.
R:  Is it?
L:  Yes, I had one, um, oh, golly, it had to be a good three weeks ago.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And then, you know, then they sent me, you know, an email saying, "Do you still want to participate?"  I said, "Yes".  You know, I said, "This is really interesting 'cause y- -- you talk to someone, you know, all over.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you know, I talked to someone before from Georgia.
R:  Did you? 
L:  So, it was -- so, it was nice, you know, to get a different, you know, all over and, you know, then you talk to them about, you know, you know, their views and, you know, ... 
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, because, I mean, I imagine you -- I don't know how big the city you are in.
R:  Well, I'm close to -- I was born in Philadelphia so I'm -- I'm in New Jersey, a suburb, you know, like about fifteen miles from Philly.
L:  Okay.
R:  For the time being I'm here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Do you -- do you travel? 
R:  Well, I was thinking about going down south, down Virginia  Beach.  Of course, there's not too much opportunity over here.  The company I had worked for went out of business.
L:  Ahah.
R:  And, like, unemployment ran out so ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm starting to feel it now and I hear there's a little bit more opportunity down there.  But it's getting bad all over, by listening to the news.  I mean, every day things are getting worse.
L:  Oh, yeah, that -- well, that -- that doesn't help with the -- the situation how everything is and, you know, the economy and, you know, yes, we're helping out this other country and stuff but, you know, you have to worry about your own country here. You know, it's --
R:  We should start collecting some of them debts from those countries.
L:  Right.
R:  A lot of countries owe us a lot of money.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, you look at it too, how much is being spent, for the, you know, for the war and stuff.
R:  I know.
L:  And was it really worth it.  Did we, you know, -- did we acco- -- what did we accomplish for ourself, for our country.
R:  Right.
L:  Did we accomplish anything.
R:  Well, I don't know what we accomplished so far.  I mean, I'm glad the, ah, soldiers are back.
L:  Right.
R:  And this --
L:  Oh, definitely. 
R:  -- and that, but, ah, I really don't see
