L:  It's just something I do and I got to talk on the phone for like five, ten minutes, come on.  It's something that they pay you to do, it's -- it's a national study, a linguistic study, I'm serious.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Michelle.
L:  Hi, how are you, my name's Gill.
R:  Oh, hi, how are you? 
L:  All right.  You know, we just have one little problem.  I didn't hear the subject because someone else kept trying to talk to me and I'm on a cell phone and I was just coming in the house.
R:  Oh.  It's about the Middle East and what you think about what's going on over there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And if you thi- --
L:  All right, fine.
R:  And if you think there's going to be peace and should the US stay involved.
L:  Ahah.
R:  So, how do you feel about it? 
L:  Well, do you want to start off and I will respond. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I wish -- certainly would like to see peace over there but I'm not so sure, it seems likes it's a pretty volatile area.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it -- it really does.  Um, well, personally the way that I see it, well I -- I think -- I think it's materialistically driven, the whole thing.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, I'm here.
L:  Oh.  And I don't think I'm being narrow minded about it, I just think, you know, a lot of it has been driven by materialism.
R:  Materialism on whose part? 
L:  The United States.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, there are people that are sincere in what they are doing but I think, um, -- I don't think it's really legit, I think it is being driven by a lot of materialism, as far as the oil that they want, because you have other nations that are -- that are -- are just as so called evil and or wicked and that have a lot of arms that are not being documented properly and -- and they're not being gone after.  You know, the same for [inaudible] going after these nations.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  See, I kind of struggle with it because, um, I know that they've made some kind of gruesome finds about what were being done to the people over there.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  And I think if, ah, that kind of stuff's going on and we don't do anything, I mean, I would hate to see another World War Two type thing, you know, with the Nazis and all that.
L:  Right. 
R:  Because they found that warehouse with all those body parts in it.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And you think, man, if that's going on -- 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- then it's like you've got to do something.
L:  Well, you know, with me I have to be completely honest with you, right.
R:  Yes.
L:  I am African American so in my experience of the United States, well, I don't have to go into detail about that so I am a little questionable when any -- any government, anyone in authority states their reasons for doing things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because this country has a -- a history of oppression itself and it's being -- and it's always been done and still being done in such a subtle manner and don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those bitter people and militant and, you know, and flag waving about it but at the same time I'm aware of it.  So, it -- it appears to me that -- it's -- it's always something else, it's not what the public is being told.
R:  Oh.
L:  There's always some -- some [inaudible] then you got the part that it still bothers me the fact [several inaudible words] it's like for what, you know what I mean.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And for me the -- the American public didn't want it [several inaudible words] we live in a constitution, you know, where it says that, you know, for the people, by the people and the American public didn't want it and yet still they proceeded with it regardless of what the public said, you know, and -- and I -- I would say a good ten people I talk to, black, white, whatever race, they really -- they don't -- they oppose the war. So ... 
R:  Oh, yeah. I don't -- as -- as far as my friends go I don't think people oppose it but I don't think they were for it.  Most of the people I know -- 
L:  Right, right, right.  You're right, you're right.
R:  -- kind of middle of the road kind of, well, we don't really know enough to make a decision.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  You're right, maybe oppose is too strong a word but they're not really for it as of yet, I agree with you, I agree with you.
R:  Oh right.
L:  Because I don't like tyrants.  I mean, even though the United States has -- has their -- has their, -- you know, their -- their -- you know, has a lot of bad history, but at the same time I wouldn't want to live in any other place, you know.  They also have the -- the, ah, possibility to be a really great nation.
R:  Right.
L:  They always have because the structure is set up in that way.  It's just that you have so many screwed up people that take advantage of it, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And they pervert it so, I agree with you whole heartedly on that subject, I really do.
R:  But it -- it's -- by the news it sounds like they don't want America to stay there to help them any more either.  That was the other question they asked, do you think that America should stay and help.
L:  I'm sorry, what did you say?
R:  The other question that they asked us was do we think that, um, the U- -- the US should stay there and help. 
L:  Should stay there and help?
R:  Yeah, help them right now, you know, try to get peace and establish the government but it sounds like the sentiment in Iraq is they don't want us there any more.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, that's what I heard on the news today, they're saying they want America to get out now and let them -- let them deal with it themselves.  But I don't know --
L:  Well, in that -- well, in that sense, if -- if -- if the country itself -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  My feeling is if the country itself says they want America out and they want to deal with it themselves, then that's what America should do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They should respect their sovereignty and government and let them deal with their own country as far as repairing it and putting it back together, they have to do that.  That's what I feel.  I think America takes it upon itself to say that we as the peace keepers we spreading democracy across the world but I think that's somewhat arrogant in a way.  You know, like I said, we have our own problems and we have a lot of things that need to be done here so ... and it's not the point of not trying to help another nation but if the people themselves say that we want the responsibility of our own country then you are supposed to let 'em do that, they are not children.  There are children there but you understand what I mean? 
R:  Yeah, I think so but I think they need to make sure that they kind of, you know, that there aren't any bad guys waiting around to take over and just kind of  -- 
L:  I agree, I agree.
R:  -- keep going with everything. 
L:  I agree.  Let me ask you a question.  Where does that end though?
R:  When what?
L:  Where does that end as far as making sure there are not any bad guys taking over, where does that end? 
R:  Well, I think they have to somehow get some kind of government at least set up and established, some kind of authority, um. 
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible] Mhm. 
R:  Put something in place and then once, whatever, you know, structure is in place I think they need to leave.
L:  Right, right.  Once that structure gets into place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right, right, I agree.
R:  And they have got some kind of system set up, something, you know, it doesn't have to be modeled after us by any means.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  But some kind of a system set up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, you know, they could, um, get them back on their feet.
L:  [inaudible] Ahah, I agree.
R:  So -- so, anyway ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It would be nice for it to be over and have everybody back home.
L:  Well, that -- that will be a blessing.  You know, I'm just -- I'm just -- now -- now the main thing is worrying about what do you think is going to happen afterwards as far as the United States, people are worried about terrorism here increasing, what do you think's gonna happen? 
R:  I don't know, I -- I heard that they, ah, arrested somebody in Detroit. 
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  Um, they had some explosives in the back of a car and they were looking at a bridge. 
L:  Right.
R:  And I think, man, I don't know.  I feel like it's never gonna be the same again.
L:  No.
R:  Like there's always gonna be, you know, -- 
L:  Something.
R:  -- suspicion and stuff going on in the background.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So.  Where are you from? 
L:  Me, I'm originally from New York, I live in Philadelphia right now.
R:  Oh, okay, I'm in In- Indiana.
L:  In Indiana? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Never been there. [LAUGH]  Have you ever been to New York? 
R:  Um, once or twice I think.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah --  
L:  Yeah, I'm originally from New York.  I have been here about six years.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Yeah, been in Philadelphia about six years, which I hate. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words]
R:  Oh.  I have -- I have never been there.  Um, I'm trying to think what the other questions were they asked.  It was all about the Middle East stuff.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  Like if we ever think there will be peace.  I think that was the other one.
L:  What do you think? 
R:  I -- I don't know.  It's -- it's so volatile.  I think that, um, -- I'm not trying to put down Islam but they just seem so --
L:  Volatile. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and mil-, you know, so militant in their views, you know and -- 
L:  Right, I agree, I agree.
R:  And I think -- I think it's gonna be hard -- 
L:  I agree.
R:  -- when they always think they need to squash the enemy and ... 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Do you know what I -- 
L:  Do you have religious beliefs? 
R:  What?
L:  You, do you have religious beliefs? 
R:  Do I what?
L:  Do you have religious beliefs? 
R:  Oh, yes, I do.
L:  Okay.  And you are? 
R:  I am a Christian.
L:  You are a Christian.  Well then -- then -- then I have -- I have -- I don't like to put certain titles on things because there's so many names and there's so many people that perverted the name but what I would like -- but what I feel about 'em is this, I feel that -- that I do believe there is definitely a God, there's a supreme being, I think he has [inaudible] and above and beyond all I don't think we are supposed to destroy each other.  And history has shown that man can't do it on his own, you know what I mean? 
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  History doesn't show that.  I mean over thousands of years he has never been able to do it on his own, he cannot do it on his own.  Man is imperfect, he's gonna always do something wrong, he's gonna get haughty, he's gonna get proud, he's gonna get arrogant, you know, and in these societies just like people argue about capital punishment, and to me the strongest argument against it is the fact we have got a society that creates these monsters and then you want to kill them.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean look at [inaudible] the average kid can turn on a video and see all the nakedness and sex and vulgarity that -- that he wants and this is what he [inaudible] every day.  So what type of mentality does it fuel, you know what I mean.
R:  I know.  Oh, I know.
L:  You understand what I'm saying? 
R:  Yeah, we don't let our son play video games or watch TV.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I mean it's really bad.  I have an eighteen year old daughter and I talk to her often and I'm always telling her, you know, "Don't look like a hoochie", you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Or look like these girls, these -- dress different, be a lady and you will be surprised.  You're got a girl that someone is gonna want -- you're the one that someone's going to want to marry, you know, not the one that they just want to see for a few minutes, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  It's just a whole, um, you know [inaudible] ... 
R:  Yeah, it's really too bad but the impression I get of those people, is it just seems that they are so tilted towards violence, you know, and they reward people for doing things, you know.  
L:  I understand.
R:  Like did you hear about how Saddam used to, um, pay off the families of the Palestinian, um, suicide bombers? 
L:  I'm listening.
R:  You -- you know, when -- if a Palestinian blew up somebody in Israel, he -- Saddam Hussein would give money to that -- to the dead guy's family. 
L:  Right, right.
R:  Saying, "Oh, that was a good thing --"
