R:  Good evening.
L:  Good evening. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, my name is Sharon.
L:  My name is Erica, I'm from California. [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm from Oregon.
L:  Cool.
R:  How are you this evening?
L:  Huh, happy Easter. [LAUGH]
R:  Pardon?
L:  I'm pretty good, happy Easter.
R:  Pretty good [COUGH].  Do you do much flying?
L:  Um, well, not really, once every couple of years.
R:  Ah.
L:  What about you? 
R:  No, yeah, that's about the same, about once every couple of years.  Have you flown much since the nine one one?
L:  No, we haven't.  Have you? 
R:  Ah, well, I -- I have a couple of times.  I was scheduled to fly out the day that it happened so -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it was kind of an interesting experience [LAUGH] but we did fly about a month or so after it happened and -- and I know security was really tight at all the airports that we went through.  We flew from -- flew from Oregon back to Washington DC so we had to stop at several different airports and the security was really -- really weird at all the airports so I-- I do know that they have upped all the security and I understand now that it's just about as bad.  I have a friend that lives in -- in Washington area in Maryland and I talked to her a couple of weeks ago and was talking about maybe coming back there later this summer and she didn't -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- suggest it 'cause she said that, ah, "Security was really a mess".  Her husband works at the airport there at BMI Baltimat- Baltim- Baltimore.
L:  She said yesterday because it was that bad with the security. 
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She said "It was really just a real mess".  It wasn't so much the safety end of it, it was just that it's -- the security is so tight and it's just such a long drawn out experience to get in and out of the airport -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Wow.
R:  -- and what not, so she said she wouldn't suggest it so I guess it's just as tight back there, but I don't know.  I personally don't really think that the security really has a lot to do with the terrorism because I really think that the terrorism gets on, you know, they are smart enough to be able to get by -- get -- to bypass the security but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's just my, you know, my own personal [LAUGH] opinion there.
L:  I agree.
R:  For whatever it's worth, I guess.  I don't know that -- and I -- now, the -- the -- a lot of the pilots or some of the pilots anyway are carrying guns and I don't know whether that's, you know, going to be a plus or a minus either, that's just more opportunity to have more people get hurt should they decide to take over the plane so -- 
L:  Right.
R:  Who knows what makes it safe or what doesn't make it safe?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Um, have they caught -- I think they have caught some people though.
R:  They have.
L:  Ah, like, someone with a shoe bomb or [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right.
L:  Something like that.
R:  Right, yeah they have.  The problem is is that so many a times is that the people that are actually doing -- that are the terrorists that are carrying the bombs or carrying the whatever, aren't the ones that are the masterminds, you know.  They've got their-- they're just the people that do it and they just really have a real morbid thought about life and it's not very important to 'em, so consequently that's -- you need to get -- they need to take care of the ones that are instigating it, not the ones that are actually doing it and it's hard to catch them.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, I agree.  But, you know, terrorists I think they are trying to do like, surprise attacks.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They- they already surprised us with the airplanes.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I doubt that they'd, like, strike us twice with that.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, it's hard to tell.  They have some weird -- weird ways of thinking for sure but maybe since we've done all of our -- our damage or done all of our good, whatever you want to call it in Iraq, well, maybe they've -- will decide that we really mean, you know, we're really serious about the terrorists and -- and they will leave us alone for a while, at least that's all we can do is hope, anyway and -- 
L:  Yeah, I hope so. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- But I don't --  I don't think that the tighter security really does make a really big difference to -- to the terrorists.  I think they're going to do whatever they're going to do because like I say they just don't have a real value on life and -- and they get real brainwashed as to what they think is the best for their own personal --
L:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, they do plan out so if there is tighter security they'd make plans for that.
R:  That's true.
L:  Um.
R:  Very true, very, very true.
L:  I am going to get on a plane in San Francisco to go to Hawaii.
R:  Oh.
L:  Ah, in, like, two weeks.
R:  Oh.
L:  Or so, so I'm excited about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have to get there, they say, three hours early.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my mom always used to make us get there, like, two hours early, so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  It won't be too much of a difference but I'll see how tight the security is.
R:  Right, right, yeah, it will be interesting.  I think a lot of it too makes a difference as to where the plane's going.  You know, if it's going, like, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, going to Hawaii I wouldn't think that there would be a real, you know, a real -- too much of a danger anyway.  I hope no danger at all for your sake but -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I wouldn't really think the danger would be too high going to Hawaii, but where they're going, you know, going like into Washington DC or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- into one of the bigger airports, you know, that's probably where your danger really is, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's hard to tell, you know, I just kind of believe that you -- you're going to go when you're going to go, and if it's -- if that's the way you're going to go, well, that's the way you're going to go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think it really makes much difference but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- I -- I -- you know, I -- I know that they are trying to make it safer and so that's all you can do is I guess give 'em a chance to try and make it as safe as possible.
L:  Well -- 
R:  So.
L:  -- but the fact was I'm trying to make it safer.  I think it could be tougher for the terrorists to plan another -- 
R:  True.
L:  -- ah, attack, say, on -- with the airplanes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's good.  
R:  It might -- 
L:  As tougher as we can make it, the better. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They might think twice about it, too, you know, may not -- not be so cocky about what they're going to do and really think seriously about -- about it before they do it, so that would make a -- make a good id- good sense to 'em.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I don't think they have the right, um, perception of what America is. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, they don't, they don't, no.  My son in law is from Turkey and I have -- our ex son in law I should say, but he -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- he has a real different idea on -- on life in general and -- and really on the family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and just on a lot of things and when you have somebody like that that's in -- a member of your family basically, you kinda see where they're -- not really where they're coming from, but you can kinda better understand I think their -- their philosophy.  You know, if they don't -- like, he's been here -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about, oh, God, I guess he's been here about seven years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Almost seven years now and I can see where he's changed a lot but I can still see every now and then his -- his heritage kind of creeps back into his attitudes of -- of life in general, you know, and they just really -- the family and -- and the family especially is just not important to those people.
L:  Really? 
R:  And it's just -- it's really sad that they can just -- life is just not an important thing, you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  And so that's why the terror- that's a lot of times --
L:  I know they have different culture and beliefs.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, like, they serve purposes in their culture but sometimes they don't fit into ours.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's hard to see their point of view.
R:  Right.
L:  I've -- I've talked with some people from, you know, different countries [inaudible] and, yeah, you know, the American guy just don't go with their values.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it's their culture and, like, I guess it provides them with structure in their society and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  --  with their tradition or something so -- 
R:  Right.  Are you a student?
L:  Um, I go to college. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  But you don't -- so do you have -- there in California?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Yeah.  So do you have a lot of other international students in your classes?
L:  Um, we have some.
R:  Do you? [inaudible]
L:  Um, I -- I can't think of many though.  I've, like, one person from China and one person from France, that's all I know.
R:  Mm.  So not really any that are from the -- any of the Arab countries that would have a terrorist -- 
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm just going to a community college.  We do have, um, Arab people at our college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know it's changed for them.  Oh, yeah, just like security, you know, how they get singled out sometimes.
R:  Right.
L:  Or supposedly, but I know -- I know that's wrong with, ah, you know, we have value -- like, our American values are we're not supposed to discriminate based on race and stuff, but I -- I think I can understand where that's coming from because they fit the profile.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, right.  But I know that -- that the one time, like, I say we did fly just right after it and I swear every time I turned around, they were making me stop and take off my shoes and -- 
L:  Really?   
R:  You know, stand up --
L:  It's going to be that bad, huh? 
R:  Yeah, with my arms --
L:  It's going to be tiring.
R:  -- stand, you know, out to my side and, you know, and I'm like sixty years old so it's not -- it's not like [COUGH] I was a typical terrorist that's for sure, you know.
L:  Yes.
R:  And very, very Caucasian and very, you know, definitely no doubt in anybody's mind should be that I definitely was a wholehearted American, so -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I did.  It seemed like every ti- every airport we went through, I had to get the supreme check out, you know, and -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so when you say, you know, you hear about them profiling and you -- you want to make -- you want to think, exactly what profiling are you talking about, you know, but I'm sure that some people feel like that they are, you know, are profiled against or, you know, set into the profile.
L:  Yeah, I've seen some articles about it.
R:  Right.
L:  So, That's what I [inaudible] 
R:  Right, I have too, without any doubt so -- so have you been doing the surveys for a while?
L:  Yes.  Um, well, this is my third phone call.
R:  Oh.
L:  What about you? 
R:  Yeah, I have for a little while.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just -- it's an interesting thing and I -- I do shop the mystery shops and -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, I was doing that too but, oh, my parents were kind of getting upset with me 'cause I was doing so much of it so I quit because they weren't -- weren't supporting me and they wanted me to focus on other things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And now they're like, "Well, next time you go to a Barbeques Galore, can you get me a barbeque grill"? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, "When's our next dinner", you know? 
R:  [LAUGH] And you going, "I was doing that and you didn't want me to".
L:  It's fun, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  That's the way it happens sometimes without any doubt.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] My thing is is I get so many, you know, I sign up-- not for so many because I don't do a lot of 'em -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it seems like when I do sign up for 'em, they're all at one time, you know, and it's then like I have to go here.
