R:  Hi, um, my name is Andrea.
L:  Hi, my name's Stacey.
R:  Um, okay, um, this is my first conversation so I'm not sure.
L:  I know, me too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  So I -- I guess we -- we just discuss what our feelings are about the Middle East.
L:  Okay, I can do that. [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, --
L:  So how do you feel about it? 
R:  Well, I -- I'm not exactly the most knowledgeable person as far as world affairs and foreign diplomacy but, um, I -- I definitely had mixed emotions when I first heard that we were declaring war, especially with all the adversary and, like, the UN and even our own country was split.  Um, it's -- I think that, um, -- I did think that we rushed in a little too much and -- and the whole war was just a product of, like, poor planning from the Gulf War.
L:  I -- I'm kinda -- I have similar thoughts about it, you know.  I thought that it wasn't really necessary for us to go to war.  I guess now that we're there I certainly support the troops that are there -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, do anything I can to help their families and just -- but I think it's just a waste of our resources kinda to be over there and I don't -- I don't think that it's gonna do that much good.  I doubt that we'll ever have -- I mean, I don't think that they're ever gonna think highly of Americans over there because we've just been interfering in their lives for so long.
R:  I think it's just there's so much, like, cultural and religious -- 
L:  Differences.
R:  Yeah, differences and, like, deeply rooted hatred that in their -- in what they've been taught through politics and through education and -- and through religion that -- that, like, this is just fueling further -- further terrorism against us and even though we could -- we're probably going to win the war, [LAUGH] I think we -- we're going to have to watch our backs for a long time.
L:  Yeah, because I think that even though, you know, now they're getting all this humanitarian aid that's going over there and everything, I still think that they hate us.
R:  Yeah, I think Bush -- I think Bush is trying to -- well, I -- I know that Bush really doesn't have a say militarily, I think it's Ron Stone[?] that, you know, like, pulls all the -- the strings but, um, I know, I have speak- spoken to a lot of people and they feel that -- that if we go to war we should go to war completely and we shouldn't give any aid whatsoever and we should -- I know a lot of people feel that we should just run the country, [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Well, and it seems crazy too.  Did you know that -- I just learned this recently, I guess I don't pay that much attention to world affairs either, and I didn't even realise this, but after we're all done we have to pay to rebuild all of their country, all the buildings we blew up and everything, and so it's going to end up costing us a huge amount of money to do that.
R:  Wow. And -- wow, and then what happens, when we -- are we going to have -- are we going to have, like, a temporary government that's controlled by the US just to, like, get them on their way or are we just going to let them try to fend for themselves? 
L:  Yeah, I think we might be there a long time because I think we're staying there until they supposedly get some sort of stable government.
R:  I -- I -- 
L:  And that could take a while, so ... 
R:  Yeah, I think it's gonna end up being, like, the -- the demilitary[?] zone in -- in Korea and we're just gonna have troops stationed there constantly trying to keep the -- the peace and -- and I don't -- I don't know if there's any -- there's, like, there's no specific end point.
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- I don't even think once this is all over Bush has any plans for, like, what's going to happen with our own country and our -- our own problems.
L:  [NOISE] Well, and sometimes I think that maybe it's more that he wanted to go over there to protect the oil that we might be getting from them and things like that instead of really that he just wanted to be rid of Saddam or thought that they were gonna have, you know, weapons of mass destruction against us or something.  Sometimes I think that that was just kind of what they were saying that they were doing over there, even though that might not have really been the agenda.  Sometimes I wonder --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if we're getting the whole truth about the matter.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I really don't think that Bush had any intent on at least saving the people that are in Iraq.  I -- I know that, like, as a -- as a result from a theme there, there are a lot of people who were oppressed by Saddam and who now feel, like, they're politically free but I don't think that -- that was Bush's intention.  I think it was -- it was a lot of -- of, like, financial motivation as far as the oil and -- and just arm- armament security, that we don't have to worry about them building nuclear weapons if they -- if they were designing it to -- to be used against the US.  I don't think he had any, like, humanitarian reasons -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- at all.  And I don't even -- like, once -- if we do find all the -- the top wanted people that are in that deck of cards that they have issued, how do we know that somebody else isn't going to raise to power that -- that is just like Saddam Hussein?
L:  Right, because they have so many years of hatred against us that I'm sure there will be plenty of other people willing to step up and take his place. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and the other thing that I was a little worried about is, like, we went into this war without any sanctions or -- or any support whatsoever except for -- for Britain. 
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and we did what we wanted to.  Do you think, like, the other countries like France and Russia and Germany, they're -- there's gonna somehow keep this in their heads later on and -- and either unite against us or just have this fear of us for the rest of, I don't know, however the United Nations long they may last? 
L:  Well, I think that now we tend to kind of think well why are we even a member of the United Nations if they're not gonna ever back us up or help us, you know, they were so against it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Then on the other hand you think well maybe we should have waited longer and listened more to what they had to say because they obviously didn't think that there was enough reason to go forward with the war.
R:  Right.  So we went to war without their approval.
L:  Right.
R:  Did -- I don't know how, as far as it works, getting the -- the support of the general people in America, does he have to -- -- he has to -- did he go to war even without support of Congress?
L:  Oh, I think that they were behind him, I'm not sure though. 
R:  Right.
L:  Because I didn't really start paying that much attention until we were actually at war because I just thought, "Oh, they're just talking about it but we won't really do it".  That's what I kept thinking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then I was kinda surprised when we did start, you know.
R:  I just feel that, like, a lot of -- we have -- we can -- we can go ahead and -- and run into any country that we feel is a threat, like, um, Afghanistan or -- or Iraq and -- and pull the strings however we want, whether it's, like, covertly or whether we declare an all right -- all out war, and I think that we're just -- we're just gaining so many enemies from doing this, not acting diplomatically and just thinking that because we are a world power we can -- we can do whatever we want.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I agree with that. [NOISE]  Well, now they've been talking about Syria, that maybe we would end up going into Syria because they think -- 
R:  Really? 
L:  -- that they might be harboring some of those people that we're after, you know, that escaped from Iraq, that they might be hiding out in Syria and if they they're protecting them then we -- then, you know, then what will we do, and -- 
R:  Wow.
L:  And it could get to be another mess.
R:  Where's it gonna end?  Do you know if Israel is supporting us in any of this?  I -- I don't think I've heard anything from them.
L:  I don't know what their position is.
R:  It seems strange, like, this is -- I think this is directly related to them because they'd have less of a threat if we're there.
L:  Yeah, you'd think some of those surrounding countries would be glad that we're there.  But I don't know, they might have some more feelings about us, [LAUGH] the people in Iraq do that they just think we should mind our own business, you know, and stay out of their countries.
R:  Yeah, I -- and I'm also -- I'm also wondering if we -- say, we were to -- to invade Iraq and -- and not care about what any other country had to say about it and we take over their land and we -- you run it as a colony or something, who's gonna -- who's gonna stop us?  And -- and I mean, where's the system of checks and balances --  
L:  Right.  
R:  Globally? 
L:  There's not very many countries that could stop us probably.
R:  Yeah, well, I -- I think the only reason why we haven't done that is just the only people that -- that would be a threat to, like, the United States doing this is the United States.  I'm sure, like, a lot of voters would be against that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't see any -- any way of stopping if we -- if we decided to invade any country like China or North Korea, I'm sure North Korea wouldn't put up much of a fight.  It's -- it's kind of scary.
L:  Yeah.
