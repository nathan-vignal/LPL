R:  Hi, my name is Christine.
L:  Yes, hello.  My name is Chris.
R:  [MN] Hey, Chris.  [LAUGH] How're you?
L:  All right.  How're you doing?
R:  Okay.  So, what do you think about over in the Middle East?
L:  Ah, I really think that, ah, we'll probably still be over there af- after the war is over and all --
R:  You don't --
L:  -- to, ah, maintain peace over there and stuff.
R:  [MN] Well, I figure kind of basically for the next ten years --
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  -- um, after the war is officially over kind of thing, because, um, you know, just financial support and food and, you know, education and all kinds of things like that.  I mean, I think we're committed to that.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  That's -- that's what I think too. [MN]
R:  [MN] But, ah, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  [LAUGH] I have some mixed feelings about it, you know?  I mean -- but it isn't just because it's the Middle East.  I mean, in history we've always gotten ourselves into these [SIGH] situations where we're supporting and trying to help educate and bring up third world countries.
L:  Right.
R:  And we have people in our own country, you know, like in Appalachia, that don't have enough food on the table and [SIGH] have dis- diseases and -- and epidemics that for the rest of our country don't even exist anymore.
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  You know, so ...
L:  Yes, I agree with you there, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, if we can go into a country, you know, overseas and -- and take on that challenge, why aren't we taking care of home? [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah.  There's people over here that need [several inaudible words].
R:  [MN] Yeah.  And, you know --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- when I was a kid I used to hear -- [MN] I -- I -- some of it I -- I -- I think back and I remember hearing my parents' different comments and pe- -- adults around me when I was a kid and it's like it hasn't changed.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  I- i- i- it hasn't changed.  So, what are we doing wrong here, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah, that -- yeah, that is true, yeah.  I agree with you there.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I also cannot imagine [MN] living in a country that's been at war like they have been at war.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they're used -- yeah, they're used to fighting over there, long wars and stuff.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  I just, um, [MN] -- I haven't, ah, um -- I haven't, ah, you know, had that kind of experience.  I mean, it's one thing I guess not to have food and to have disease and all that, but another thing to have lived through bombings and shellings and machine gun and air raids and ...
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah, mm.
R:  Th- the psychological [MN] --
L:  Yeah [inaudible].
R:  I -- I guess.  And I think about kids, you know, I mean, how [MN] -- how's that going to affect them and what's going to happen to them as they grow up to become adults?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are they going to hate our country?
L:  Yeah, that's true, yeah.  That's -- that's what I was wondering about too.
R:  Because of it, you know?  I mean, i- -- 'cause it's like [MN] I can see, [MN] ah, well, we've changed their lives permanently w- -- no matter what, but it could be for the worse.  And I know -- you know, they've already started dropping food packages and -- and all that kind of stuff and the Red Cross is in there.  But are they going to address the psychological issues and that sort of thing?  I -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah.  I don't know neither.  I tell ya, it's -- it's really -- it's really been rough over this stuff -- the war and stuff has.
R:   [MN] Well, I've, knock on wood [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I've had family members that have been, like, in World War Two and the Korean war an- and all that kind of stuff.  But I personally have never been on a- -- you like, either end of it.  I've not been in the military and I've not been, like a said, live in the country where that has been war.  And I don't think I'm -- [MN] we see a lot of it on TV and stuff and I don't think we grasp --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- the reality of it.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's true, yeah.  That's very true, yeah.
R:  You know.  It used to, you know, [MN] people would come back and tell stories of their experiences --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- what they saw and all that.  And I think that impacted you more --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- than seeing it on TV.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I see it on TV and it's almost like it's not r- -- there's something that detaches you, it's like it's not real or whatever, that kind of thing.  And, um, [SIGH] I -- I don't know.  I don't think we belong over there but I think now that we're there, we're committed.
L:  Yeah, that's true --
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, I agree with you, yeah.
R:  And it's -- it's kind of like, um, yes, I was against the war, I didn't think we should --
L:  Well, they --
R:  -- do it.
L:  They say he had, ah, mass -- ah, weapons of mass destruction over there so ...
R:  [MN] I think they --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- knew that, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they've known that all along.  [LAUGH] What was really, a friend and I were talking about this, was really bizarre.  A f- -- a few weeks ago there was a movie on TV.  It was one of these series movies like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and th- the storyline was that the United States had sold chemical warfare [MN] to Iraq way back when we weren't at war with them [MN] and they in turn had sold it to Iran or some other place.  And then thi- this platoon, like, was in -- in Desert Storm --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- went to check out a bunker and one of the canisters leaked and these guys -- there were s- -- three guys that died from this rare form of cancer that was, like, really rare and so why would three people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the same company, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- die from it if it's so rare?  [MN] And when they -- you know, this lawyer was trying to figure out what was going on, that was the bottom line.  What they found out was that the United States was manufacturing chemical warfare after we signed a treaty that said we wouldn't do it anymore.  Then we sold it someone that turned out to be our enemy later on down the road.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  And then we wanted to go back in there and get it back. [MN]
L:  Right, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And I -- and then [LAUGH] -- and I -- I thought about that.  And then, you know, a week or two later then they announce how they found all this -- these chemical warheads and all this stuff and I'm, like, was that just coincidence, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or -- or was that the government's way of maybe preparing us [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- or something.  I don't know, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's what I always wonder too, yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause I was thinking how can they -- you know, I know there's, you know, freedom of speech and TV and all that but, man, they can't put stuff out there that if the government didn't want 'em to air it, it would not be aired, you know, kind of thing.
L:  Right, yeah, [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] And so I called a couple of friends.  I said, "Did you remember [LAUGH] watching this and now do you hear what they're saying on the news?"  It's almost like it desensitizes to you so y- you're not alarmed.  You're not like, "I knew it, I just knew it" but you're not outraged by it.
L:  Right, yeah.  That's true, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that kind of thing.  And I'm like, "Well, [MN] I don't know".  I -- I don't think -- I don't think -- you know, like anything else, we know half the truth. [MN]
L:  Yeah, that's -- I believe --
R:  And never will.
L:  Yeah, uh -- yeah, that's true.  They -- they want to keep everything kind of hush, hush and that's it.
R:  Well, you know, [COUGH] I don't what'd happen if people ever knew the truth.  I don't know that, ah, you know, half of the people in this country could handle whatever the truth really is.
L:  Yeah, that's true, yeah.
R:  I -- I -- you know, I mean, I don't know.  We've been so protected [MN] all our lives, kind of thing.  And, um, [MN] I don't know, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I guess it's kind of like, you know, [MN] w- we feel like as a people that it's better to ke- -- as long as it's in another country [MN] it's acceptable.  [MN] And [MN] of course because we're there, you know, w- we -- I think we like to see ourselves as the humanitarians anyways [SIGH] at -- at any cost, you know.  Like, [MN] matter how much money we lose or how bad it is for our economy or anything like that, we're --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- we're going to support them. [MN]
L:  Yeah, that's true, yeah, mm.
R:  So ... so taxes will be going up. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes, definitely. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Count on it. [MN]
L:  Yeah, we'll definitely -- yes, we'll definitely be paying more taxes.
R:  Don't be looking for that little refund. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No, that's true, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, like they did there a couple of years ago [LAUGH] where everybody got a little bit back?  They're going to be taking twice as much.  I don't know. [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  We'll be paying, that's true, more taxes.
R:  But [MN] -- but it's kind of like too -- I mean, [MN] it's almost, like, you just know.  It's like it's g- -- they're going to bite the hand that feeds 'em.
L:  Well, yeah, that's true, yeah.
R:  I mean, i- -- you know, you can't impose -- you can't impose your lifestyle and your beliefs and whatnot [MN] on someone else.
L:  That's true, yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, you just [MN] --
L:  That's true, yeah, very true, mm.
R:  You know and like, it's like, we'll [MN] -- people will probably put up with so much for so long, until they start to get on their feet a little bit and feel a little safer.  And, [SIGH] you know, the [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- getting back to more like whatever their normal life kind of thing is. [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then they're going to turn around and say, "You know, we don't need you anymore and, you know --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- we're not going to pay you back" like has happened to us before.  [LAUGH] And --"
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- all that kind of stuff.  So, [MN] I -- I have mixed feeli- -- I sti- -- I will probably always have mixed feelings but I think I -- I'm -- I accept that we're going to be there, you know.  I mean [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's the way it is kind of thing so ... [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  A- -- but, you know, just been praying for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of it and all over there, to get better and stuff.  That's about what I've been doing.
R:  [MN] Well, I -- [MN] I was really surprised.  I guess I didn't realize.  I -- I saw something on TV, some expose or something, [MN] and they were showing all the carriages and all the wealth, the chandeliers and all the stuff in one of the palaces or something that they're gua- -- we're guarding now.
L:  Yeah, right.  Yeah, I seen that on T-
R:  [MN] And, um --
L:  Yeah, I seen that on television too.
R:  [MN] And -- and then they s- -- one of the guys that they interviewed, one of the soldiers, said, "But you wouldn't believe the every day people".  He says, "In our country you have different degrees of poverty and different degrees of richness".
L:  Right.
R:  And he said, "In that country you're either rich
