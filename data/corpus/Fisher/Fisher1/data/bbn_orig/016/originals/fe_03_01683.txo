L:  Hi, I'm Cynthia.
R:  Hi, Cynthia, I'm Alan.  I'm from Portland, Oregon.
L:  I'm from, uh, New York.  Well, right now I'm living in Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, let me tell you a little bit how I feel about this particular thing.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, I am a -- a very big peace advocate.  I'm not a confrontational person at all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm a very staunch Democrat, even Liber- Libertarian.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, so I -- I firmly believe that we did not pursue enough peace as- -- peaceful aspects involved in the conflict.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but in the same respects, we've had some huge anti war demonstrations here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where the people who are involved in it broke the laws in order to -- to protest the war --
L:  Right.
R: -- and I don't believe in that.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, once we're there -- once we were -- once we're there, we're there, you know?  There -- there's kinda really not a whole lot of choice once it's decided.
L:  See, the funny thing, I understood the question to be not just about -- or not focused on the war, this war, so much as the whole sort of unrest in the region.  Did you get that or no?
R:  Um, well, yeah, kind of.  I just started it out with that.
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  [LAUGH] I mean it is sort of, you know, it is obviously what's on the top of the mind, ah --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- in terms of right now, you know?  But I guess, in my mind, you see, I -- my background, I guess I would say, politically, I sound similar to you.  Um, [LIPSMACK] but I also lived in the Middle East for a little while, um, [NOISE] I was studying the Palestinian Israeli conflict, so I tend to have a kind of -- I guess that's where my mind goes first, is to sort of that part of the region and what's going on there, um -- but I -- I think I have a -- I don't know.  I agree, I had very mixed feelings about all the protests.  Um, I sort of had the attitude of, you know, okay, m- well maybe I don't support the war, but I do support the -- the people who are there are, our troops even, are just doing their job at a certain point.  They're there because, you know, they're trying to feed their families, a lot of them.  And a lot of them themselves, they're unsure if they want to be there.
R:  Right.
L:  And protesting doesn't necessarily -- I mean, if that's the sort of image that they're getting of what's going on here, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] it doesn't really make them feel,  like, good about themselves putting their lives on the line [LAUGH] which maybe we -- is not our responsibility but, um, I think it -- you know, it's sort of -- it's already a hard place for them to be in, especially those soldiers that were in a kind of -- themselves in a morally questioning place.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I feel like, when I lived there, I kind of became pretty sceptical about, um -- I mean, I sort of went, you know, in terms of looking at dialogging and all this stuff, and -- and the longer I spent, um, there, the kind of less I felt -- I felt like there were -- have been moments in history where the pe- -- the -- a lot of these techniques could have been very useful, [LIPSMACK] but I don't have a lot of, um, faith that in the next, you know, ten to twenty years at least, um, there's going to be the possibility for a real and lasting peace in that region, personally, um, which maybe sounds pessimistic, but just from my experiences, talking to people, um, has kind of led me to that belief.
R:  Oh, I -- I firmly agree.  I mean, I -- I look at it and there's no one over there who has a -- who would r- -- a- -- who's in power in any way who would truly benefit by peace.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, they're all --
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and what are we going to do?  Are we going to go over and beat everybody up and take their place and say, "Okay, now we're going to control it"?
L:  Right.
R:  Well, then we're just bad as the guy that was there beforehand.
L:  Absolutely, absolutely.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, I mean -- and that's the thing is -- I mean, now we put ourselves -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I -- you know, whether or not we had a -- a moral obligation to go into Iraq is certainly very questionable on -- on lots of sides, but we definitely put ourself in, um -- ourselves, the US, in a -- in a really very morally compromising situation now, I think, because, um, we're sort of damned no matter what we do, pretty much.  I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, unless we somehow magically s- -- you know, set up from behind the scene, you know, without having, uh, [NOISE] too much influence, the most, uh, democratic and -- and the happiest, uh, [NOISE] government the Middle East [NOISE] has ever seen.  There's going to be a lot of backlash from the fact that we are in there and that we are having a lot of influence, um, I think.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I would -- I would agree very much.  I mean, you know, we put Saddam Hussein in power in the first place.  Twenty years later, we're taking him out.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]  Right, I mean it's similar -- unfortunately it's similar to the fact that, you know, we had trained Osama bin Laden, um, and many others in that -- in that region, in many of the techniques that they were then able to use to kind of invade us, um --
R:  Right.
L:  It just has to do with who we -- what side we happen to be on at the moment, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Kind of fickle that way.  So I don't know, I think, um, my problem is I just get so overwhelmed.  I just get -- I sort of come back at a certain point, I'm like, "I can't watch news any more.  I can't think about it any more because I'm here" [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Right.
L:  In a way, the best thing I can do maybe is just to try and live my daily life in a peaceful way, you know, as you were saying, like just trying not to be a aggressive person.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Seems almost the most helpful thing that one can do, or not even not just aggressive, but sort of, uh, move- -- someone who moves towards peace.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  But that's hard to do, you know?  It's hard to actualize in a -- in the --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- smallest ways.
R:  Yeah, it definitely is.  I mean, I -- I have friends who are over there right now, and I'm really concerned that they're -- you know, they may never come home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and yet I -- you know, a- as much as I disagree with the war, that's why I wouldn't protest it, because they're there, you know?  I don't want --
L:  Right.
R:  -- me to happen to get filmed and see one of my -- and my -- one of my buddies just catch it and think that I'm, you know, trying to get him -- you know, not supporting him --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but in the s- -- you know?  And in the same respects, they didn't want to be there, I mean, they're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- National Guard, they're not army m- -- you -- you know, they're not career military people so, you know, out --
L:  And even --
R:  -- here in Oregon --
L:  Sorry, go ahead, "Out here in Oregon --".
R:  Out -- out here in Oregon, the National Guard went before the -- the career military people did.
L:  Huh.  Wow.
R:  So, we s- -- 'cause we -- you know, we don't have the security alerts that you guys are having back there.
L:  Right.  Right.  Huh, that's interesting.  Yeah, I mean, here it's like, y- you know, all of a sudden you feel like you're living in an armed city.  I mean, if we walk around, I literally have -- like, the subway station when I go to work, I have soldiers with, you know, huge guns [LAUGH] in my subway station.  I mean --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's scary.  It's very scary, because it feels like a kind of militarization, that, you know, if it went corrupt, would be very dangerous.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- these guys have the right to, you know, kind of suppose whatever they want to suppose about you, um, and I'm just -- you know, I'm, like, this little white girl going to work, you know, I'm a teacher, I mean, I'm not -- there's no reason for me particularly to be afraid, but it -- it doesn't matter.  I mean, you have this kind of atmosphere of fear, I think -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, here, particularly here, you know, obviously.  But, um, yeah, I -- I know what you mean, I think that even with the career military, there's so many people now that are going into military because they're single parents or because they -- you know, it's just that it's almost -- it's so much more for the steady job for most people [LAUGH] than it even has to do with -- you know, they're just hoping that they can serve their time, you know, be in the reserves or whatever and get a tuition break or college or whatever, and get out without getting killed.  I mean, I think a lot of people now who are in the armed services aren't there necessarily because they want to be, you know, in battle.
R:  Oh yeah, I -- I would have to agree.  I mean, like I was saying, the people that I knew, the -- uh, one of them, he wanted to get away from all of his friends who were winding up in jail for drugs.  He didn't want --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to go down that road, and the military was a way to, you know, to make a living, to -- to help support, you know, his family, 'cause he comes from a very, uh, hi- hierarchy family where, you know, the family lives together or lives within a couple of blocks of each other, and that way he could send money to his family, and still be producing something and, you know, not -- not wind up in jail like half of his friends did.
L:  Absolutely.  No, I know, I mean, um, I had a friend who went into the military, you know, he w-  -- he got [NOISE] [MN] kicked out of some schools and then just sort of dropped out and -- and, um, you know, it was really like the last sort of option that was legal, [LAUGH] you know? 
R:  Right.
L:  In terms of figuring out what he was going to do with himself.  And in his case, you know, he was lucky, and he got out before this war and he actually started going, you know, finishing his high school degree or whatever on -- on the boats when -- when he was -- [MN] you know, they would let them take history classes or something [LAUGH] on the boats that he was serving on and, you know, and it -- it served him really well, and I think that's why people do it, because it can work.
R:  Oh yeah.  It's a great way for people to straighten themselves out or to get ahead in life and stuff like that, if that's what works for you, and unfortunately, a -- a lot of people who'd looked at it that way are now stuck in a place where they got guns aimed at their heads. 
L:  [NOISE]
