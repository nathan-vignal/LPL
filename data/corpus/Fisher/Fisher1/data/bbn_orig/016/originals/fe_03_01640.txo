L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Mandy.
R:  I'm Susan.
L:  Susan, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.
L:  So, we have to talk about issues in the Middle East.
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  Okay.  So, what do you think, where shall we start? 
R:  Ah, well, I was all for it.
L:  Yeah, was? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Until? 
R:  No, I'm still here.
L:  You're still all for it? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, do you know anybody who's over there? 
R:  No.
L:  No. I don't either, um, but, you know, you hear about people all the time, we've had a couple of people in our area that have died fighting and it's pretty sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, do you think that they can ever solve all the problems and bring peace back? 
R:  Ah, now that I hear about what's going on, I don't think they'll ever have a -- a -- the kind of government we think they should, you know.
L:  Like a democratic, like we have.
R:  Because they live in kind of tribes.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  And it's -- it's almost like they -- they don't know how to have freedom.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like when, with all the looting and everything that's been going on, the, -- you know, their religious beliefs, you know, don't comply with that but, you know, they're still doing it 'cause they can, like, ah, its all their leaders, ah, you know, the religious leaders are calling for them to stop and behave and they just don't really know how to govern themselves.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, do you think we should stay over there for a while?
R:  Well, I heard that we might be getting some -- ah, having bases over there.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah, but I think, ah, in three of the big towns.
L:  Oh.
R:  One up north, one in his home town and then another one.
L:  Ha.
R:  And if they do that, that's good I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would help but I'm -- I'm afraid that if we stay too long we might get into it with Syria, or -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [MN] 
L:  And -- and Kuwait and all those places that we have already had problems with.  I just, um, -- and people over there seem to hate us.  I mean, they -- they like what we've done for them but they want us to get out and they, you know, expressed concern that they don't want us to control their government, so I don't know how that would hap- -- 
R:  Well, would not -- I don't think we're supposed to control it, we're just supposed to help set it up.
L:  Yeah, but if we have a -- a presence there forever, I don't know, I -- I guess it's kind of scary just that such a -- that we're walking on thin ice with the people because they want us -- we want them to respect us, in other words, we're there to help them but it seems like we are kind of suspicious.
R:  But if -- if we just up and left -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think a lot of people there would die.
L:  I -- probably.
R:  So we have to stay long enough to, um, you know, make sure the people aren't gonna die when we pull out. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, make sure everything is somewhat solid.
R:  Their hospitals are up and running and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they, you know, -- do they grow food at all there?
L:  You know, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or if -- is it -- I know they have that -- that oil for food program to the -- I think it's the UN that set it up, that, you know, they sell their oil for -- for, you know, produce and all that kind of stuff but I don't know if they have any that they can rely on without that, I don't know.  I can't imagine it being a very fertile area.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Morally just -- and they -- they rely so heavily on outside sources.
R:  Well, I think +Baghdad is like a oasis but -- 
L:  Oh, really. 
R:  -- they -- they've got so many homes there, you know.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  In the town and all that, then they have used up all of it, you know.
L:  Right, they've -- any of the fertile land they might have is covered up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, I don't know.  I hope that, ah, that something happens quickly.  I -- and I haven't -- I haven't seen on the news lately if they have gotten the looting and everything under control but ... have you heard anything?
R:  Well, I heard that there's still a little bit going on.
L:  Is there? 
R:  But -- but -- 
L:  A little bit of unrest.
R:  I think the marines pulled out and now -- 
L:  Oh, did they.
R:  -- it's just the army.
L:  Oh, okay.  I don't know, it -- it seemed to go a lot faster, a lot more simple than I expected.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  It's -- it's almost, like, it's been too easy, I just -- I'm waiting for something real catastrophic to happen.
R:  Yeah, I'm the same way, I'm, like, [MN] something's gonna happen. [LAUGH]
L:  A little apprehensive about it.
R:  They're gonna find the -- the chemicals and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's gonna be too late and somebody's gonna spill 'em and ... 
L:  Yeah, or Saddam is out there somewhere with his finger on a button somewhere waiting.
R:  Yeah, you're quite --
L:  What for, I don't know. 
R:  Blow up the whole country.
L:  [LAUGH] He probably would, including himself.  As long as it made him look good.
R:  I kind of think he's gone.
L:  Do you? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  'Cause they haven't -- they don't have any evidence of that but they don't have any evidence that he's alive either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't know.  I kind of -- I kind of like the hard evidence.
R:  I think all the pictures you seen of him were -- were -- it either wasn't him or it was, ah, [MN] --
L:  Yeah, yeah, things that -- the misidentification.
R:  And last time he was in the news a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And this time he just wasn't.
L:  That's true.  That's very true.  I don't know.  And they seem to have gotten a lot of his -- his supporters and -- and his sons and a lot of those people have been killed, a lot of his, you know, his Cabinet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it could very well be. 
R:  But they might have got him the first time.
L:  That's tr- but haven't -- didn't they have video of him since then? 
R:  Yeah, but he's got a lot of doubles.
L:  Oh, that's true, that's true.  I heard an interview on MTR[?] with a guy who was a double for him but it's not -- he doesn't live in Iraq, he lives here, he just does it for -- actually, he has done it for Saddam but he was pretty funny.  He usually -- he -- now he does it for entertainment purposes.
R:  But those people over there, they could, ah, have a -- a good government because the ones that are living in this country are living under our government.
L:  Yeah, they have a good example.
R:  But there's just -- they're -- they didn't start this government either, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, this is true.  And I don- -- the culture is so different, it's so different, the way they view, um, every- and the way they view the -- the roles of men and women and -- and education and -- and all those things are so -- so different, I don't know if they could make a democratic government work, because, you know, for however many years it's been of dictatorship. 
R:  How many calls have you got on this study? 
L:  Um, just this one.
R:  Oh, this is my fourth one.
L:  Is it?  So you've been getting paid for it? 
R:  Well, I was in the one before but my cheque ain't come from it yet but I know that a lot of other people got paid so I'm not worried.
L:  Oh, okay, well, yeah, I just barely found out about it.
R:  And they had a lot of glitches in the other one.
L:  Oh, did they.
R:  And they fixed 'em all so ... 
L:  Oh, good. 
R:  This one's running smoother.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm just wondering, it said three calls and this is my fourth one, so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know if I am going to get paid for this one.
L:  Oh, yeah, or maybe the one with glitches they weren't counting but that's odd they didn't communicate anything with you. 
R:  Well, it said you could, -- ah, you could get three and they could call you back up to twenty.
L:  Oh, gee.  Well, hey, that's good, that's two hundred bucks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You like that.
R:  I'll just keep going, just see. 
L:  Oh, yeah.  The money is good.
R:  But this is the best talk that I've had that I could say something about. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, [LAUGH] really.  What other topics have you had? 
R:  I had, ah, airport security.
L:  Oh, gee.
R:  September eleventh, censorship in schools. 
L:  Oh, yeah, that's -- yeah, there's a lot more news coverage about Iraq, a lot more to find out about. 
R:  Where do you live, what state? 
L:  I live in Utah.
R:  I live in Colorado.
L:  You live in Colorado? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you're not originally from there, you have a southern accent.
R:  Ah, I was born in Arkansas and raised in Texas.
L:  Oh, okay.  I have a brother that just moved to Texas.  Um, his little boy, I am wondering if he will grow up with an accent.  He'll be very cute.
