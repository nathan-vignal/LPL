R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Lynette.
L:  Hi.  I'm G- I'm Lisa from Michigan.
R:  Hi, I'm -- I'm from Pennsylvania.
L:  [LIPSMACK] All right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  What, do we belie- do we agree what's going on?  Is that what the question was?
L:  Yeah, I think so.  What do we, um, think about it.
R:  [MN] Well, I think something had to be done. [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.
R:  And I think, um, that we sh- that we did the right thing.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I wasn't a big supporter until we actually went in there.  And then, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- supported the troops, definitely.
R:  Right.  And I believe that US should be involved in setting up the country then.
L:  Definitely.  I mean, somebody had to do it, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  And I don't believe the UN should be involved in it since h- they didn't want to do anything from the start.
L:  Right, [NOISE] yeah.  I think it's pretty much [NOISE] in our hands.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  All right.  Well, ten minutes is a long time, isn't it?
R:  Yeah.  Is this your first one?
L:  No, actually I've -- um, I've done it a couple of times.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I haven't really, um, [NOISE] paid that much attention to the war covera- coverage or anything like that.  I mean --
R:  Right.  Now, I did when I -- it first started.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I haven't been glued to the TV lately.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  It's been -- it's been really sad and, [MN] I mean, it's just kind of depressing to watch.  So, I turn it on every once in a while but ...
R:  Right.  I just read into the paper where, um, [MN] anybody that was leaving Baghdad, the marines were ordered to shoot if they didn't stop at the warning shots.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, apparently they shot a lady which [NOISE] I can see where they're coming from because they're afraid of the suicide bombers --
L:  Right.
R:  But, oh my.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot -- a lot of in- innocent people are going to be killed.
L:  Right.  I mean, [MN] yeah.  They should understand that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We're not really doing it, you know, against them.  It's kind of for them.  But, I mean, I can understand how that would be a hard situation to be in because, you know, I -- I can see myself wanting to leave.
R:  Right, exactly.  Exactly.  Now, I understand there's problems with S- -- um, [LIPSMACK] oh, Syra?
L:  SARS?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I understand there's problems there now too.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hadn't heard that.
R:  Yeah, so, we'll see.  I don't know.  As long as it doesn't come over here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  But, I mean, they're going to have a hard time because if the soldiers are around that then ...
R:  Right, right.
L:  They'll have to come home [LAUGH] some time.
R:  Right.  [MN] Um, t- -- we lost two more marines it said in the paper, when, um, [MN] ah, one of the weapons -- they -- the Iraqi had shot the -- went through the top of their, um, [LIPSMACK] war vehicle.
L:  Oh.
R:  So we lost two more marines. [COUGH]
L:  Well, we haven't lost too many.
R:  No, fortunately we haven't.  And then we did find those seven, which was --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- wonderful.  As long as we can keep finding 'em, which I don't know about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think we've been really lucky though.  I mean, we found a lot of them and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's good for them and good for their families.  It was heart breaking to see all that on T- -- you know, their families just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wanted them to come home.
R:  Right.  But, um, [COUGH] we -- I think we were a hundred percent right going over there an- and, um, intervening [COUGH] with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in getting Saddam out of there.  [MN] Hopefully he's in the rubble somewhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That's not nice to say or anything but --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- something like that.
L:  Well, have you see on, um, [LIPSMACK] TV, all the looting [NOISE] of the --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- museums and everything?
R:  Yes.  Ah --
L:  Can you believe that?
R:  Well, I guess they're so --
L:  Ah.
R:  They're so free they don't know what they're doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I see wh- I heard where the marines are even taking over because the police couldn't even handle it, the Baghdad police.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The marines had to take charge.
L:  Well, I can imagine.  I mean, those people were scared to death to do anything before and now --
R:  They got, yeah, freedom.
L:  Yeah, they -- they can [LAUGH] -- they're on top of the world right now.
R:  Yeah, I think they're going to have problems there for a while until they have enough of taste of freedom.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  'Cause this is a whole new concept for them.
L:  Yeah.  But, I mean, it's good for 'em, you know.
R:  Right, right.  [COUGH] I just couldn't imagine.  We're so used to living free.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then having to go to a country like that, you know, it's d- [MN] phew, that would be [LIPSMACK] -- I think that'd kill me, you know what I mean?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They have to live like that, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, I mean, it's almost over, you kn- [LAUGH] I -- I mean, it sounds to me like it's almost over so ...
R:  Well, I'm hoping it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  You don't have any family members over there?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  No, I don't either.
L:  God. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I couldn't eve- even imagine.
L:  I know.  And you never know, you know what I mean?  It's just --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  You never know if they're okay or not.
R:  Right, right.  Now -- but this sh- this war, they had a lot of communications, you know what I mean?  They had --
L:  Did they?
R:  The reporters had cell ph- -- cellar -- cell phones that they were going to allow them to use and --
L:  Oh.
R:  You can, you know, you had cameras up front on the front line.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, the other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- war we didn't have at all.  [COUGH]
L:  Right.  The David Bloom thing was really sad too.
R:  Oh my, yes.
L:  Those poor little kids.
R:  Mhm.  I really -- I really liked David +Bloom, he was really nice.
L:  He was.  He was a -- he was a great reporter.
R:  Right.  [COUGH] So ...
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Now, are you married?
L:  [MN] No, I'm not.  I'm actually a student.
R:  Oh, okay.  My last survey I took I had a student from California.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, you're a student from Michigan.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And now is it warm where you are?
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] it was but it's cloudy now and it's getting a little cooler.
L:  Yeah, we had some awesome days during spring break.
R:  Did ya?
L:  Yeah, we had some seventy, eighty degree days and now --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's just kinda [MN] gone and we're back down to forty again. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, wh- --
L:  I'm kind like, where's summer?
R:  [LAUGH] We're low f- fifties so ...
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] [inaudible]
R:  But --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that your phone beeping?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Low battery?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm just trying to hang in there until we [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- get done.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I can't seem to be responsible enough to hang the phone up.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  It's a hard concept for me to learn.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, but, um, hm.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I guess you're not married?
L:  Nope, nope.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How about you?
R:  Um, yes, I'm married and I have four kids.
L:  Wow.
R:  I've got two of my own and two step children so ...
L:  Are they all older or younger?
R:  Um, my son's fifteen, my daughter's ten and the two step twins are, um, [NOISE] seven.  They'll be -- ah, the boys, they'll be eight in a couple of weeks.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You've got a handful, a little Brady Bunch over there.
R:  Oh, oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, keeps -- keeps you going.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So.
L:  I bet.  I can't imagine ever having kids.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you have to be ready.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ooh.
L:  Ah.
R:  But -- but, um -- now, you said this isn't your first interview?
L:  No, it's not.  I've talked about, um [SIGH] --
R:  +Censorship?
L:  Yeah, for the schools.
R:  Right.  And there was something else.
L:  That was the only other one I've done.
R:  Oh, really?  Now, this is my third so, I- I'll be done then.  [COUGH] And I -- did you sign up -- is this your first you've signed up or did you sign up before?
L:  This is the first.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, yeah.  What did you think on the censorship for the schools?
R:  Um, [MN] I was in between.  I mean, I -- I think they should be able to read what they want to read.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the people that have the problems with the books they read, then they should go to pub- private schools, you know what I mean?
L:  Mhm, [NOISE] yeah.
R:  But, um -- [MN] but then I don't think they should be to w- read, you know, gory murder cases or, you know, something like that.  It should be age appropriate.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I said, you know, why don't we just leave it up to the parents?  What right do the schools have to tell kids what to read?
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  You know.
R:  But I know --
L:  I mean, there's -- I can remember, you know, being younger and my parents would say -- I can't remember, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, war stories or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or Sophie's Choice --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was reading --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  My parents said, you know, that is [MN] -- they were just like, "Honey, that's a really sad book" you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- but I can't image school telling --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what --
R:  What to read.
L:  -- to not read, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, do your sc- -- do your kids go to private or public?
R:  Public.
L:  Public?
R:  M
