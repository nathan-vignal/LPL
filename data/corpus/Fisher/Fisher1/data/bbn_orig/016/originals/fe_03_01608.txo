L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm doing good.
R:  Good.
L:  What's your name?
R:  My name is Debbie.  What's your name?
L:  I'm Michelle.  And where are you from?
R:  I'm, uh, in Gig Harbour, Washington.
L:  Oh, wow, I'm in San Diego.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  So --
R:  -- just up the hill from us [LAUGH], or down.  You're down the street from us I guess, huh?
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so, um, is this your first call, or ...?
R:  No, actually, this is my second one that I've done.
L:  Oh, this is my fourth.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [SIGH] I didn't think they would let you do more than three, so I was surprised that I got another one [LAUGH].
R:  Have you gotten paid yet?  I have- -- I haven't received anything yet.
L:  I haven't either --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I've t- -- I -- I do talk to people that have.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, my very first call was about a month ago, so --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- it was weird.
R:  -- I think mine was about three weeks ago.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I keep track of mine 'cause I do other independent contracting things and so --
R:  Oh.
L:  I would, you know -- the spreadsheet that I already have up and I've kept a track of 'em --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and, you know ...
R:  Yeah, I was just kinda curious, I -- somebody had sent me the link in the email that this was through the University --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what is it in Pittsburgh or something?
L:  Mm, I think so, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Anyway, what was the topic again?
L:  Um, something about airport security and, you know, if it prevents anything [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't -- I don't know that I really think it does.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  You know, I mean, I've only travelled once since September eleventh and that was the December like, ri- -- a week before Christmas right after that and, I mean, it didn't seem like they were doing much to me.
R:  That's what -- that's what -- somebody else I was talking to was telling me that too, that they had, uh, travelled, uh, from Fiji up to Seattle and, uh, um, they didn't notice a thing.  Even internationally --
L:  Oh, yeah, I mean --
R:  Could you tell them to hang up the phone downstairs please? [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Is that your children.  [LAUGH]
R:  What was that?
L:  Is that your children?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I understand.
R:  Yeah, they love to pick up the phone when I'm on the phone.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, luckily enough mine -- we only have two phones in the house and one's in the living room and it's the phone I'm talking on, and then the other one's in my bedroom and they don't go in there, so --
R:  Oh, good.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, um, I don't know.  When I travelled, um, it just seemed -- I mean, yeah, I waited in a lot longer line --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it didn't seem -- like that was about the only thing that seemed to, you know, be a difference.  I mean, again like I said it was like, you know, over a year and a half ago almost --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But [SIGH] -- trying --
R:  Well, my hus- --
L:  -- to remember because it was so long ago, but it was just kind of, you know, ridiculous.  I thought, you know, "Why am I waiting in this l- long line" and I get up there and, you know, you're going through in like three seconds.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, where you were before --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then you get up to the -- the ticket gate where -- right where you're, you know, about ready to board the plane and they r- randomly were, um, you know, choosing people -- and they think they had predetermined the people that they were gonna --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, pull -- pull out.  You know, predetermined as in, you know, half hour before we were boarding or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, my husband did a lot of travelling during that time.  He started a job in October of that year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and travelled until, um, I think, February.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, he was travelling almost weekly and he said, you know, even then he d- -- he never got pulled aside as much as he thought he should have tr- basing that he was travelling weekly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, he said he got pulled like twice.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know, because he started getting known 'cause he was taking[?] the same flights every week.
R:  Oh, yeah, well then they probably saw a familiar face there and --
L:  Well, that's -- 
R:  -- weren't so worried.
L:  -- that's -- that's a good thing in my -- my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for my husband but, I mean, what if it wasn't?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I mean, what if it was someone trying to stake out, you know [NOISE].  I'll be in in a few minutes, okay?  Sorry, my six year old is ready to go to bed and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, he wants me -- only me to tuck him in.  [LAUGH]
R:  Of course.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  How many kids do you have?
L:  Um, I have a six year old and a four year old.
R:  Oh, cute.
L:  What about you?
R:  I have a ten, a nine, a five and a four.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, we've got a house full.
L:  Um, do you have three, or just two kids that are in school?
R:  Just two that are in school.
L:  Oh, so your five year old's not in kindergarten yet?
R:  No, huh-uh, not yet.
L:  My daughter will be in kindergarten, um, when school starts.  My son's in there right now, so --
R:  How do you guys like San Diego?
L:  I'm not too sure if I -- we've only lived down here since, uh, February or March of last year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, lived here about fifteen months [NOISE].  Good night Ashleigh, I'll come in and tuck you in in a minute.  But, um, it's -- it's a lot different than Denver.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, is that where you're really -- originally from?
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my husband -- like when he started travelling he had gotten a job out here but we couldn't move out here quite that quick [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, we waited about, you know, six months or something and then moved out here.
R:  Mhm.  Are the people a lot different -- more different than --
L:  Well, the whole culture's different.  I mean, down here, um, ninety nine percent of the people I run into, I swear, [SIGH] speak Spanish.
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  I mean, it was -- you know, so -- it's just very different.  I mean, a lot of 'em do speak English, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, most of the people speak Spanish and I don't hardly speak any.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I -- I'm sure you'll pick it up pretty quickly.  [LAUGH]
L:  I did -- I -- I did take like four years in High School --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, can't remember it that well.
R:  It's not like that in Western Washington where I'm at, but in, um, Eastern Washington I'm -- my phone sounds so funny.  In Eastern Washington there's a lot of, uh, farming communities and a lot of -- oh, I'd say a lot of the population over there are migrant workers from California --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- you know, Mexican and -- 
L:  We're about --
R:  -- from Mexico.
L:  -- we're about five minutes from the boarder anyway.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, I mean, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the big thing.  I mean, we live almost the fartherest South that you can go --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but even my grandmother who lives up near San Luis Obispo, California which is --
R:  Oh, that's beautiful, yeah.
L:  -- about, you know, almost the most north you can go in what they consider Southern California --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's still a lot of people that speak Spanish.  I mean, she runs into probably about ten percent of the people though that speak Spanish --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but compared to where I'm from, where you know, half of a percent [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- speak Spanish [SIGH].  It's -- it's a big difference.
R:  Oh, it must be kind of -- I -- I've never lived in a -- in California, so -- but I've heard that.  I've heard, you know, and it -- all the signs are in Spanish and --
L:  Oh, well it's not so much that --
R:  -- everything is --
L:  -- I mean, there's a couple of billboards that my husband are like, "We're in America, why are they in Spanish?"
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I mean, we can understand that's catering to them.  They -- they have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yes, they have to learn the language but it gets to be monotonous when you're driving around and you're like, "Why am I reading something in Spanish?"
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  You know, or that's only in Spanish.  It's not like, you know, it says, "Hello" and then says, "Hello" in Spanish, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's -- it's just the whole thing in Spanish and you're thinking, "Huh" --
R:  Yeah, we're --
L:  But it's just kind of so- --
R:  -- American and you need to learn to speak English, yeah.
L:  It's kind of different, but I don't know --
R:  [MN]
L:  But we've -- we've only been out here for a while --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, we're only gonna be out here for, hopefully, another like two, three years.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, and then are you gonna move back to Colorado?
L:  Yeah, we hope.  [SIGH]
R:  Do you like it in Colorado quite a bit, or --
L:  Oh, if it didn't snow and it had a beach it would be much better --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- but my family is there and his family is there, so --
R:  Oh, yeah, that kinda makes it difficult to be away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we lived in Iowa for five years while my husband was in school and that was really different.  I didn't -- I didn't enjoy that at all.  I really --
L:  Yeah, well, my husband's a native Colorado and he was born there and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- other than a year when he was out here when we first got married and he was in the military, he --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- didn't ever live anywhere else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Me, on the other hand, I didn't move to Colorado until I was almost eleven.  It was a couple of months before I turned eleven and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I remember living somewhere else, although, you know, Colorado's my home.  I mean, I went to high school there, you know, I -- we got married there, you know, all that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of stuff, but, you know -- so I'm used to living somewhere else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But he -- he's not and so it's really a lot di- more difficult for him than it is for me.  [SIGH]
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  You know, I mean my family is, you know -- not here but, you know, I get along.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  [SIGH]
L:  But, uh --
R:  Um, I'm trying to think more about airport stuff.  I mean, it's pretty --
L:  I know, those topics that are -- there's nothing --
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- to talk about.  I did --
R:  I had -- I had one about fitness, I think, was one of the topics --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- and that was even harder.  [LAUGH]
L:  My -- my very first topic was, what would you change about your life?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah --
L:  You know.
R:  -- I got that one too.
L:  And so it was, um, it was -- it was hard because both of us were like, "Oh, well we're pretty happy with our life".
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, we sat there and did a lot of chit chat and w- which was nice, but you never talk to the person again, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you don't know what else to talk about.  Then the other two topics I had -- one was on nine eleven, so that one was -- you know, you had so much to say that our -- we got cut off in the middle --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I did another one on something about sports.  I can't remember exactly.  It was like, you know, do you think that they should be able to go on strike?  And like basically, do they get paid too much?  You know ty- I --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  I can't remember the exact question they asked us but the lady and I just kinda talked about all these different things --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and we never really talked -- 
R:  Every --
L:  -- I mean, we talked about the -- the topic but not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- exactly what they asked us.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, we were kinda close and you know.
R:  I wonder what they're stutter- studying?  I wonder what they're studying ab- --
L:  I think they're -- I think they're studying communication.  I don't think they're studying what we ask about the top- -- or what the topic is.  Otherwise they'd specifically say, "Stay on the topic".
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, I -- I think they're talk- -- they're trying to figure out how strangers communicate and, you know --
R:  That's probably what it is.
L:  You know, um, different people -- 'cause I mean they asked where you're from, so --
R:  Yeah, I was wondering if -- if they were trying to do, um, different like, uh, speech patterns of different areas --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the US.  You know, is -- 'cause a lot of different areas have different --
L:  They ha- --
R:  -- accents in a way.
L:  'Cause the people I've talked to -- I talked to one person from California --
R:  I've talked to California too --
L:  Who else did I talk to?
R:  -- and, uh, Texas I think.
L:  Let's see, California, Iowa ... now, where was the other lady from?  You and then -- I can't remember now where the other lady was from.  But, I mean, I've talked to pretty much people that have the same speech pattern as I do.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  I haven't talked to like anybody from Texas, or I mean that has like this big old, you know, southern drawl.
R:  Southern drawl.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, which is ironic because I was born there and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- spent like five years there when I was little.
