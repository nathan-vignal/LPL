R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Jackie.
R:  Hi Jackie, my name is Thomas.
L:  Hi.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Washington State.
R:  Washington State, I'm in Cal- -- Southern California.
L:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Did you hear the topic?
L:  Yes, I did.
R:  The topic I believe I heard was -- says, um, regarding peace in the Middle East?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it sounded more, like, they were trying to be specific to Iraq.
L:  Probably, since that's what's going on.
R:  Yeah, and they had mentioned do they feel that the US should be involved still.  As far as I can tell it only seems like that would be with Iraq at this point.
L:  Mhm.  Yes, I, um, I don't watch news and I don't read the paper, and I have no idea of what's going on.
R:  For -- really?
L:  Really.
R:  I'm surprised.
L:  I, ah, I went to my girlfriend's one day, and, you know, she was going, "Oh, the war, the war", and I just looked at her and I was like, "What are you even talking about?"  I'm just --
R:  That's -- I'm surprised. [LAUGH]
L:  I, ah, I just don't -- I don't watch TV.  I, you know, I don't, ah -- I guess I'm in my own little world. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, there's nothing wrong with that by any means.
L:  Um, I think if it's -- I mean, from the -- what happened in New York --
R:  With September eleven?
L:  Yeah.  If the war is because of, of that or that is involved, I think we need to be involved and do whatever it takes so that it doesn't hopefully happen again.
R:  I would agree with that.
L:  But, um, I just -- I don't know what's going on.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the, the latest happenings is that after about four weeks of being at war in Iraq, um, the governing party there has been toppled.  So after four weeks we've already, s- so to speak, liberated Iraq, and we're now trying to install a new government for them.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Okay, well, that's -- that's probably going [LAUGH] in the right direction.
R:  Yeah.  That -- at least we hope so.
L:  Yeah.  Are -- who are they putting in?
R:  Um, they've taken one of our former lieutenant generals, I guess, from the United States, and he's there to work as the main person to mediate instituting the new government.
L:  Mm.  So, this guy is going to find people over there to be the new government --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- or run the new government? 
R:  Well yeah, that's the idea.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then, I guess the, the next main topic is whether or not we stay involved in it after that new government is put in place or not, you know, ideally thinking, will they be able to keep peace for themselves or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do we set up bases like we had in Germany, or, you know -- as we still do, I should say, in Germany after, like, World War Two, do we have that kind of involvement still where we keep bases there and keep our presence in the country or not.  I think that's the next biggest question the press is raising at this point.
L:  Oh, huh.
R:  And I guess that would fall right in line with what we're thinking about, and our topic tonight is whether or not peace will --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- come about or not.
L:  Well, I wouldn't -- I would think that we should stay for a while at least, just to make sure the other guys don't get back in.
R:  Yeah.  Well, not knowing where they are at this point is also a big --
L:  Right.
R:  -- concern as well, 'cause they, they've only found a couple of people on the list, list of fifty or so people the want to capture, or find the whereabouts of, and that, that leaves an outstanding presence of knowing, okay, is peace going to prevail or not if we leave and don't have these people in custody.
L:  Yeah.  So they're saying that there's fifty people that are running Iraq --
R:  No, they -- there are [MN] at least fifty people that were running the old --
L:  Oh, okay.  Were. [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  -- Iraq that they were looking for.
L:  Huh.
R:  That they've been looking for.
L:  That's kind of amazing that only fifty -- that's not very many people.
R:  Well, well if you -- 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- there's been a lot of things that are coming out now that make you sort of wonder how they controlled what they did, and it was -- they worked like sort of a, and old Italian mob is what they worked like, because some of the things that we're finding out.  I mean, the country was in ruins while they lived in the lap of luxury, just like sorta gangsters did back in the old New York days.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  It's pretty funny to read some of the articles they found, and the things that they did, or tried to do at least.
L:  Huh.  Wow.  I guess [LAUGH] I should be paying attention to the news.  Hm.  Hm. Oh, that's interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Do you live near a metropolitan area, or are you in a rural area up in Washington?
L:  No, I, I'm, ah, about an hour north of Seattle.
R:  Okay.
L:  I used to work for Boeing, but because of September eleventh I got laid off because nobody's buying airplanes anymore.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely not at the rate they were --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if at all.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, we -- we were, ah, putting airplanes down in Arizona in the desert to mothball them, because that's -- the air down there doesn't rot them.
R:  Oh, that's interesting to know.  I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We -- well, we were building them and then all of a sudden people says, "Oh, we're not buying them".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they backed out of their deal and the planes are built.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- they put, put this white paint on them and stick them down in the desert.
R:  Interesting.
L:  You know, it like preserves them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The dry air.
R:  And the heat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The constant heat.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's funny.
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm without a job. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  Therefore, I have no contact with anything anymore.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I sit home and play with my animals and let the world go by.  In fact --
R:  That's pretty --
L:  -- I talked to a lady last week with this, um, and she's in Iowa, and it was something about, you know, has anything changed since the September eleventh, and she's in Iowa.  Nothing is different.  She's on the farm, she has no idea that the -- what the world is going through, she doesn't know anything about going security checks, and you know, and it was like, "Wow, that's really amazing".  And yet I'm [LAUGH] pretty naive right now too.
R:  That's interesting.  Well, I guess we're -- I guess it all depends on where you are and what you -- what the, the life situations you are involved in could, ah, give you an idea as to what you may surround yourself with.
L:  Right.
R:  I know here in Southern California that's all we deal with, is what's going on in the world, so to speak.
L:  Wow.
R:  So we, ah, we're pretty involved with -- are pretty surrounded by trying to figure out what's going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and always keeping a tab on what's going on.
L:  Are you in it as, as a living, or just that that's what's going on?
R:  Um, basically that's just what's going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I know quite a few people who are over and involved in the conflict in Iraq, so it makes it sorta more personal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to a sense of knowing somebody who's over there and they may not come back and I may never see them again.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And all for the process of hopefully providing a stable country to the people who live there, and hopefully finding what they originally went in for, which was weapons of mass destruction, and proving that they had them and, and disposing of them.
L:  Mhm, yeah.  I, I believe that the weapons are there.  I've heard people talking about that, and I, I think that they're there.  Somewhere.
R:  Well, I, I hope for the fact of, of giving, you know, substantial reason for us to go in and, and not follow along in what was believed in the UN, saying, "We're just gonna not agree with you and go in anyways because we know they're there and we want to stop them from using them".  And, I hope that they find them for just that purpose alone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As well as, you know, for the whole pre- peace process and knowing -- letting other countries in the surrounding area know the, the situation as it is, you shouldn't -- you shouldn't be harboring people --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- who are involved with these things.
L:  Right, right.  Well, that's so true.  Hm.  Yeah, I don't, ah -- I don't know anybody that's over there.  In fact, any- you know, the people that I used to work with, I don't think there's anybody in my, in my surrounding area that we know anybody that's over.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's interesting too.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure there are, it's just people that we don't know.
R:  Yes.  Nobody that you know.
L:  Uh-huh.  Hm.  I feel, like, I -- when she was saying the -- what the subject was, it was, like, -- I almost hung up, because I'm so out of the loop.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I just don't, ah -- I mean, I, I know a long time ago when they were talking about the, the weapons that were over there, and -- I mean, it's just -- where I -- I live in a small town, I think we have one stop light now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's farm -- it's a farm community, and um, I mean the newspaper, our, our local newspaper has nothing on anything outside of our town.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  There's no, no, um, government, no federal government, there's nothing.  It's just local, you know, it's maybe six or seven pages [LAUGH] and, ah, so I just -- I don't -- I'm out of the loop.
R:  Well, like I said --
L:  And I don't get the big paper. [LAUGH]
R:  Like I said, there's nothing wrong with that by any means.  I mean, you have a life that you live and that's probably one of the more protected areas in life of what we know as America to be, so I
