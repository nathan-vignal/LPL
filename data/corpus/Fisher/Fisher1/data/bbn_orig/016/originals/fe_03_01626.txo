L:  Hello, this is Angela.
R:  Hi, this is Sherrie.  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm fine.
L:  Good.
R:  Yeah, great.  Well, I guess our topic of the day is the Middle East. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, did you hear some of the suggestions that they mentioned?  I have my opinion.  I think --
L:  Well, yeah, I heard a couple of the things.  Do you wanna go ahead and start?
R:  No, you go ahead to start.
L:  Okay, well, um, personally I think at this point -- I think it was necessary for the United States to go in, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think they needed -- we needed to -- I -- I think we're gonna ultimately find out that, um, there were a number of issues not o- -- not only weapons that were being hidden, but I think a lot of the -- like the graves that were uncovered -- a lot of, uh, humanitarian issues that really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- needed to be uncovered and brought out in order to help the people.  Um, however, at this point I think that at the same time we need to allow the -- their country to set up the type of democracy that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they want and kind of go over there and kind of be the -- sounding board and -- kinda like mum and dad and just kinda watch, but we have to let the kids go at that point.
R:  Okay.  Well, I disagree.  Um, you know, I -- I think we needed to be over there, but I think we in there for the wrong reasons and I don't see any proof of any weapons of mass destruction yet.  I think we can ar- -- you know, we can be a little overpowering.  I think there were some, um, human rights issues with, um, Saddam Hussein and things like that and so you -- you probably need to get tyrants out, but as far as coming over and occupying the country and -- and doing the whole, um -- just the way that we did it, um, I think it's -- I think it's wrong.  I think -- [LAUGH] we- well, you know, we threatened them first with what they call a preemptive strike.
L:  Right.
R:  We're trying to prevent something worse from happening, or, you know, or we're giving uh, um -- getting, um, what is that?  Um ... those chemical weapons --
L:  Right, weapons of mass --
R:  -- being --
L:  -- destruction.
R:  -- yeah, over here and -- and things like that.  But, you know, we said, "Look, you know, we're gonna come over there and if you don't turn over all these weapons, we're gonna do X, Y and Z".  And I'm thinking, "You know, if I was this person, I wouldn't give up my weapons, you know, I -- I'm being threatened".  But I don't really think they have the capability to have as much as we are hearing that they have, so -- and I'm pretty sure a lot of this, you know, it's media and we probably don't know everything that's going on.  We're only told a little bit about, you know, everything that happens in -- even in the Middle East or any other kind of, um, you know, international issues.
L:  I don't think it's just international.  I think --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's also in this country that everything's not told also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah.  I mean, to a certain extent I think we -- I think we did allow, you know -- we gave 'em fair -- the way I look at it, we gave 'em fair warning that, you know, basically, if you don't, you know -- Saddam, turn yourself in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Let us come in, you know, you take out -- kinda one of those things of when I ask my kids a question and they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- don't really wanna answer and they don't wanna open up their room --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Kinda thinking, "Okay, there's something in there you don't want me seeing".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, at the same time there's some human rights.  I mean, the women over there were just being --
R:  I -- I agree with you on that score.
L:  Oh, my gosh, there's --
R:  You know, well -- well just the killing people and they did find evidence of -- of mass graves, so --
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  And evidently the sons were, especially one of 'em, was just a real --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- twit.
R:  Yeah, and he was torturing people and -- and the like, but so did -- you know, we've got Idi Amin, we've got Castro, we've got, you know, everybody and, you know, there's the whole situation in Africa where they're cutting off people's arms and legs and, um --
L:  Well, that's what -- I mean, I don't --
R:  -- and we don't --
L:  Of course, Middle East is not the only place it's happening --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's what -- at the same time I think you know, maybe we need to go back and say, "Okay, now we let you guys go, now where else do we need to look at and see?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because especially with the women, and that's what's sad about the Middle East is that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at least in Iraq the women were allowed to hold positions of -- and learn -- get education and have --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- their own positions.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Whereas, in other instances, in other countries in the Middle East, the women are simply --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to be seen, take care of the children, cook, clean --
R:  I don't know if they could be seen, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, okay, they're little --
R:  -- probably more like heard.
L:  -- black forms that are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- walking around that can be seen by, you know, husbands --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- type of, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- type of thing and I think that -- that maybe we -- our country isn't one hundred percent --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- right all the time, but at least we have a right to say to our government, "We think you're wrong", whereas, you know, the women aren't even allowed, in many parts of the Middle East to even say, you know, "You're wrong".
R:  Right, or vote, or express an opinion, b- b- --
L:  Right, in other parts of the Middle East, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --such as Pakistan, I mean, people are simply going into places and blowing themselves up because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the religious issue --
R:  Right, if you come t- --  
L:  -- which is terrifying.
R:  Well that's -- which -- which brings us to the next point.  Now that we've come over there -- now, you see how the clerics are fighting amongst each other --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so now it's gonna be like, are the +Shiites -- Shiites are gonna rule, um, Iraq --
L:  [MN]
R:  Is it gonna be the Kurds?  Turkey wants a little piece of this and I'm gonna say, "How do ya -- how ya gonna pick a -- a democratic leader now for this country?  How they gonna restore, you know, order?"  
L:  That's what --
R:  Are they gonna have free elections? [LAUGH] 
L:  And who's gonna say they are? [SIGH]
R:  When you have a -- in -- with a religious country.
L:  Yep, and who's gonna say that they're the free elections because no matter who loses --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're gonna say it was set up just like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Gee, just like Florida[?]
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] You think election was a set up?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean, it'll be one of those things of whoever loses is gonna -- is probably --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gonna say, "Oh, well, this wasn't fair".
R:  They -- right they didn't get a fair deal, uh --
L:  But then at the same time, I would much rather have those issues being debated openly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than someone saying, "I don't like this".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And not knowing if the next time they get into their car if it's gonna blow up, or --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, if their spouse is gonna turn them in for being a traitor and I think that's -- was what a lot of the current situation --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was.
R:  Right, and they were m- -- [inaudible] elected general topic, "Are we ever gonna see peace in the Middle East?"  And you've got to look at Israel and the way they treating the Palestinians, or --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Or, so, you know, I --
L:  Well, and that's --
R:  And in a sort[?] of way we're just doing this because, you know, we're siding with Israel and -- and so they really --
L:  A- --
R:  -- kinda, you know, really put down the whole Arab world and, you know, we should -- I really just personally think, "That's their country.  We really should stay out of their politics on this --"
L:  Well, but what --
R:  On that issue.
L:  What I think we need to go in right now and do with our military is to restore order --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Quit the looting --
R:  Oh, q- -- okay.
L:  I mean, I don't want a Military Police situation, but at the same time --
R:  I think they're gonna have to have that to begin with.
L:  Yeah, well [LAUGH] --
R:  I -- I --
L:  I -- I have a real problem with our country having -- Museums having --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, pieces of history --
R:  Being looted, right.
L:  -- that as far as I'm concerned, belong -- especially Egyptian pieces, belong back in Egypt.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, there are African nations that we have, historical art pieces that I think belong to those nations.  They don't belong in our Museums.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But at the same time, I wanna see -- I don't want Joe Blow out there having a piece of ancient history.
R:  Yeah, they had a lot of pieces were like before Christ and like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- two[?] hundred BC and things like that.
L:  And I think those need to be retained.  Hey, I'm all for it.  You know what?  I have no problem with them going in and, you know, getting chairs from the palaces that their --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that were bought on their backs --
R:  Money, mhm -- well, did --
L:  You know.
R:  Did you read, or did you see where a lot of the, um, Muslims had returned some of the things?
L:  Oh, good.
R:  They had -- they had brought some of the things back.
L:  I knew --
R:  So -- that's like in their religion -- that's like the worst thing that --
L:  W- --
R:  -- they can do is like to steal -- that's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get your hand cut off.
L:  That's what -- well, that's what -- I knew a lot of the Mosque have said that, you know, "If you return 'em back to us --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- then nothing else will be done", and I think that's what, hopefully, and I'm trying to look at the best side of it, is that people were taking 'em to make sure they didn't get destroyed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But on the other hand there were -- I mean, there were items that were just destroyed.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's what's sad, because that's something that will never be able to be replaced, but at the same time how much --
R:  Exactly[?] their feelings and that they were so oppressed this whole time --
L:  Oh, y- --
R:  -- you know, they're -- they're acting out. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's just like -- it's just like our kids when we --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, go away for the weekend.
R:  In a way. [LAUGH]
L:  They go, "All right!  There's no body watch us --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- let's go into mum and dad's room and jump on the bed".
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, so I think it's -- some of it's very understandable and I really hope that we can -- I don't want to go in and have our government look like we're the Military Police.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  But at the same time you can't -- you can't just having people run wild.  I think they almost have to sit up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The same type of thing as what was done in New York.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're saying, "Okay, look we have a curfew" in -- in -- LA during the riots.
R:  Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
L:  Saying, "Okay, we have a curfew.  You need to adhere to this curfew.  That way you're safe, everyone else is safe, your family's safe, now let's go in there.  Because --"
R:  Y- --
L:  -- until some order is restored we're not going to be able --
R:  But they need a -- they gonna have to define a leader.  They gonna have to pick a leader to run their country.
L:  Yep.
R:  And -- and -- and run it the way -- I'm not -- you know, I'm -- I'm -- I consider myself very patriotic, but when it comes to other countries not everybody's a democratic society and some societies work, some socialisms work, you know, too much communism or socialized medicine and things like that, but, you know, I don't know if it's -- who are we to say that democracy is the best way to run a country, you know, depending on the country, and so --
L:  Well -- and if they can -- if that's the government that they chose to have just like --
R:  If they chose to have it that's what I mean.
L:  Then -- then it becomes a democratic society that that's how they've chosen to have it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When someone comes in and says, "Well, you vote for me or I'm gonna kill you" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's not a choice and that's what I feel like a lot of the Middle East, not just Iraq, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- quite a few of the Middle Eastern countries are doing and it's all based on who has the money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Who's controlling the oil fields --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- because that's -- that's ninety percent of their economy.
R:  Yeah, well you'd think we had a vested ...
