L:  [MN]  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how're you doing?
R:  Hi, I'm Pat.
L:  I'm Garren.
R:  Darren?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Darren, oh, hi.
L:  Kinda like guarantee. [LAUGH]
R:  A- oh Garren with a G?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I've never heard of any -- a name like that.  Very interesting.  Well, that's an easy way to remember it. [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, do you have an opinion on our topic?
L:  Ah, I -- I really -- I haven't a -- I -- I really don't care for it that much.  Ah, um, I was opposed of the war to begin with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, i- i- it just -- I don't know, it -- it -- it has too many ulterior motives for me and --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, you suspect our government's -- why we're there, huh?
L:  Well, ah, i- it's pretty obvious it's about the money.
R:  Oh, it's about the money?  Well, I've --
L:  The money or the --
R:  -- heard it's about the oil.  What's -- what- what's the money you mean?  You mean --
L:  Well -- or the o- -- the oil in particular, yeah.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.
L:  So ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I can understand a lot of people feel that way.  I really don't know if that's the case.  I mean, I guess we'll see if, ah, what happens there.  But it's -- it's -- [MN] she -- I think they asked about, you know, do you think we should be there and are we -- I mean, I'm afraid we're going to be stuck there for a long time, even if --
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Even if they had good intentions, which I'm not sure they did, ah, I agree with you.  I mean, it's very suspect.  And I guess my -- as far as the war, I mean, I was very upset that we didn't use the UN and -- and follow that process out more.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, and we sort of made +ourselves an outlaw in the world community, it seems to me so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Basically.
R:  Yeah, you know.
L:  I th- I think that they're gonna -- I mean, right now we're too strong.  [LAUGH] Ah, and --
R:  We're very strong and --
L:  I- i- it's --
R:  -- we're the only -- we're really the only superpower now, that's for sure.
L:  Exactly.  And -- and that -- that can be very dangerous.
R:  Absolutely, absolutely.
L:  And, um, I don't know.  The whole thing is crazy to me.  But I -- I -- I --
R:  You sound like you're --
L:  Huh?
R:  I was going to say, you sound like somebody who'd be about the age group to be over there?
L:  Oh, y- exact- --
R:  You sound young.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm twenty.
R:  You sound like you might be college.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes?
L:  Yes.
R:  And do you h- do you know anybody in the military?
L:  I know a few people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, th- the reason why I didn't join the military, ah, I'm very much so into, ah, into my religion.  And I hate to say religion but, ah, I -- I just can't see s- killing somebody for a reason I --
R:  Mhm, well good for you.
L:  -- truly don't stand for.
R:  That's good for you.  Fortunately, ah, we don't have a draft right now so you don't have to even officially do anything about that, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So -- I grew up in the sixties, I remember, ah, h- how that was played out, you know.  It was a really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hard time.  And kids having to make very difficult decisions so ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  I guess we ought to get back to our topic about the Middle East.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  I could get off on -- on that easily.  Um, [MN] well, what about, ah, you know in the long term?  Do you think that even though we got in there for, ah, you know, yo- you suspected for money or for oil money, whatever, do you think now that we're there we can help those people?
L:  I -- I think so.  But, ah -- and I think that goes onto the peace subject they were talking about.  There's a lot of people over there that resent us. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Boy that is scary.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't it scary?
L:  They -- a- a- and, ah, and not only there but, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- i- i- it's hard to -- to imagine, you know, if -- if you passionately hate some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- h- hate a certain person, a country, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or a type of people, for them to just, you know, all of a sudden surrender.  And they've proven without a doubt that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, once they believe in something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're willing to go at all cost.
R:  I -- that's --
L:  And --
R:  I agree with you.  That to me is the scariest proposition.  All those people who are willing to die for Allah and just come up and set themselves off as a bomb.  I mean, that is -- that's just outside our way of thinking, I think.  Ah, to me anyhow.  I just don't get it, you know?
L:  Well I --
R:  And I think our -- our military people who are over there, I mean, not too many of them, thank God, died in the war --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think an awful lot them could die in --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- those kinds of things.  You know, for what?  You know, it's sad.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And [MN] I -- I was born just before the Korean war and we're still in Korea fifty years later.  So, I mean --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I don't -- I really don't know why.  So I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's what I'm afraid of.  It's -- we're either gonna be there so long to keep it down.  Or being Irish, I know how the Irish people resented the British people com- -- the Brits coming in to Northern Ireland and so forth so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it could be really awful.  Really could be a horrible situation and -- and a lot of people could die over there I think.  That's what I'm afraid of.  You know, whatever got us in there, we're there now.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, I was brought up to believe -- believe [MN] nothing you hear and half of what you see.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, you're ab- -- I -- see, now that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's kinda scary.  I mean --
L:  And -- and --
R:  I'm -- I'm ju- now, I'm just -- I'm surprised.  You sound young and that seems like a, you know, to me that's like s- an older pe- person's opinion, you know.
L:  Well, I -- I --
R:  But maybe that's the way your parents looked at it.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm --
L:  I'm -- I'm from the country so ... [LAUGH]
R:  You're what?
L:  I'm from the country.  I still have --
R:  You're from the country.  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe that's a good way to be.  Maybe that's a very good way to be, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Don't -- don't -- because today, God knows, ah, there are people out there are gonna hurt you and they're lying to us.  We've seen it, you know.
L:  Exactly and --
R:  You've seen people -- we've seen people [LAUGH] lie to our faces and swear up and down so ...
L:  [inaudible].
R:  You know, it's -- it wouldn't be anything new, that's for sure.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  But I don't know, you know.  It's -- it's, ah -- a- and I don't know if we're ever gonna change people's hearts and minds.  I guess it is their hearts --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that we probably have to change, you know.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  But what about that?  It sounds like you're a pretty religious person, um, do you think that, you know -- [MN] now they want a -- they want a relig- some people over there anyhow, I saw them there demonstrating, they want a religious government.
L:  I -- a- and that -- that -- that's the thing.  What kind of government can you set up there?  Because it is so diverse over there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not -- you know -- [MN] and you can read up anywhere that it is diverse over there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can't have one set religious government without somebody [LAUGH] not being happy with it.
R:  Well, I'll you wh- --
L:  And --
R:  I wouldn't be happy if I was a woman over there right now because most of those religious governments don't do much for women.  I mean --
L:  Mm, true.
R:  Put them down, cover them up and keep them quiet, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, I mean, th- -- I mean, they -- it could end up being worse in Iraq.  Well, I don't know if it was -- how bad it was.  It sounds like some of the bad stuff is coming out now, the torture chambers and stuff, but I don't know.  I don't know.  I just -- as a woman that part of the world, ah, certainly it's not a very inviting place.
L:  Well, they --
R:  I feel sorry for those people.
L:  Well -- well, looking at that -- that point, they are -- I mean, they're -- they're extremely ol- old fashioned.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I believe that that transition --
R:  Yeah, like the fourteenth century. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  That's pretty old fashioned. [LAUGH]
L:  Well -- well, I'll tell you what though, I -- I tell you one thing.  I -- I mean, there are certain goods and there's certain bads.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, people always say be mindful of your past.  And I- I'm -- I'm thinking, you know, you got certain things that you wouldn't do nowadays that that was back then, or things was going on over there.  But they have some aspects that we can learn from.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because the patriotism, although it mind be, you know, harmful to us --
R:  Misguided.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's --
L:  I mean --
R:  Well, I think you'd call it zealotry.  I mean, it -- they're zealots for their -- and sometimes you do th- -- people like that are a little scary, don't you think?
L:  Exactly.  Well --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- their pride --
R:  I don't know whether or not that's good really.
L:  I --
R:  Because you know what?  In their country you wouldn't be able to say, "I'm not -- I wasn't for this war before it happened" you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You could -- you can say that and -- and you should be able to say that and you should be able to go out and protest.  I wasn't for it but I didn't go and protest, you know --
L:  W- w- w- --
R:  But I think people should be able to express their views.  That's what w- this country is all about.
L:  An- an- and -- and -- and it's funny you say that because to me I feel that we have a conditional freedom of speech.
R:  [LIPSMACK] A conditional freedom of speech?
L:  And I say that because, ah, the people that opposed this war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I listened to Bill O'Reilly and --
R:  Mm, oh you [LAUGH] --
L:  -- and all these --
R:  We don't want to -- you don't want to go against some of those guys, huh?
L:  We- exac- well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, see, the thing is, is that if you're opposed of what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the majority, the masses --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are saying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's almost as if yo- your freedom of speech really don't mean anything. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.
L:  And you- you're actually being condemned for what you're saying.
R:  Well, and I think that's what's wrong.  I -- I agree with you.  And I -- but I think a lot of people also agree with you that, you know, we didn't, you know, didn't necessarily want this war.
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  And just because we disagree doesn't mean we're no less patriots or don't love this country or whatever.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  And th- that is important.  It's important to keep reminding people of that.  That, you know, we're allowed to disagree.  I'm not -- I can't remember which famous statesman said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Ah, y- I may not agree with your views but I'll defend to the death your right to say them".
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And so that's what really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we have to be able --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, we may not agree but we have the right to say, you know, to voice our opinion.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Well, at least we can say it on this phone call. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Let's hope they're not -- let's hope they're not sending it off to some horrible place [LAUGH] for it to be transcribed.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they'll put us on the li
