R:  Hi, my name is Samantha.
L:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
R:  Hi, Jennifer.
L:  So the topic is, um, the Middle East.
R:  Right.  I really feel that going in there right now was a wise idea but staying there throughout the peace process is really out of the question.  Um, a lot of our soldiers have been over there so long already, some have been stationed over there for up to six months and I think it's time for them to come home.
L:  I don't have too much of a -- an opinion on it.  Um, I do agree that we should have had the war, I was all for it.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I don't -- I don't really know what to say on this topic.  I'm kind of, you know, I really don't know what I think about it fully, you know.
R:  Yeah, well, being a military girlfriend it's kind of one of these things where I'm ready for him to come home. And --
L:  You have somebody -- a family member back there? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And knowing that they could have to stay there through a peace process just doesn't seem fair.
L:  It doesn't.
R:  It's time for them to come home as soon as the war is over.  I don't think we should have to stay there and become diplomats because of the fact that we wanted the war.  Britain wanted the war but they're ready to pull out and I see no reason for us to stay there and try to sort out their issues.  We went there to do what we said we were gonna do so -- and then come back.
L:  Um, I was under the impression that the war was over.  Am I wrong? [MN]
R:  No, not really.
L:  It's not over? 
R:  Its semi over in some areas but there's still some active fighting.  The biggest part of the war is over but as for -- I know they sent two carrier ships home but there are still tonnes of soldiers over there and there are active street fights just, I guess, from protesters or pro Saddam, pro Iraqi kind of people that are still out there.
L:  Um, I have, um, a question, I don't know if it's off topic, but how well were you able to stay in contact with, um, your family members that are over there? 
R:  None.
L:  None?
R:  None. Um, --
L:  Are you serious, wow.
R:  [NOISE] My boyfriend left, let's see, a month ago and I have not talked to him one time since.
L:  [NOISE] Really.
R:  And the worse part is tomorrow is his birthday, so ... 
L:  That's hard.
R:  It's gonna be a long day.  But we have friends there and we are very supportive of them and knowing that they could have to stay and sort out problems that they did not cause or stay over there and try and form a new government just doesn't seem right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I say they need elections, just as we have, pick people fairly and then call it a day because it's just been too much.
L:  So why are they still over there?  I don't -- I mean --
R:  For a start the peace keeping deal, from what I understand.  A lot -- with them having active street fights and things like that they're staying there almost as armored guards to protect, I guess, just normal civilization.
L:  So has, ah, nobody been able to come back yet? 
R:  Two carrier ships were sent home.  I guess it's been about a week and a half ago and that's it.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  And they have been out there the longest so yeah, it was time for them to come home but all of the new people that were just sent or otherwise are still there.
L:  Wow, you don't hear a lot of this on the news.  I mean, I watch the news quite frequently but, I mean, um, I live in Oregon and, um, the news here is -- it all pretty much says that the war is over. I mean --
R:  Well, I am in Virginia and we are surrounded by a lot of military installations and of course being not that far from Washington we get a lot of their news so I guess we would hear a little more but I'm not sure how much.  I rely on the Internet a lot to kind of sort things out and figure out what's going on.
L:  When should you get word that, um, you know, they might be sending people back?
R:  It's hard to say.  I'm just one of these people that when he knocks on the door then he's home because I really don't expect to hear anything else.
L:  That's really tough.  I mean, you can send things over there, right, but can they not respond or -- 
R:  I haven't even sent anything because he was stationed away from here actually in Kentucky and he had a friend tell me that he was leaving.  It was just one of these things, he did not feel, like, he could say his goodbyes properly so I found out two days after he left and as for any contact, it has been nothing.
L:  Wow.
R:  And we went through an adopt a soldier program and we actually got this guy that drives a tank and I guess we wrote to him three weeks ago and we still haven't heard anything back so I'm thinking that contact is little to none.  But it's really hard for the families.
L:  This has gone on a lot longer than I thought it would.
R:  Oh, me too.  But I think it should have been finished the first time.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They went over there and just kind of said, "Oh, we're done" when they were nowhere near.  So, I can't foresee having to go back five years from now, ten years from now to do this all over again.
L:  Wow.
R:  But it has been an interesting war, having a lot of the news media people over there right in the middle which sometimes is fair and sometimes it's not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we've seen firsthand exactly what's going on where we didn't have that with Desert Storm.  We know.
L:  Yeah, I know some people in the military, but I used to live in California --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- and, um, I moved to Oregon so I lost contact with them all but I know a lot, that was my main group of friends, so I'm sure they're all back there and I don't know anything about what's going on with any of them.
R:  Yeah. That  --
L:  I don't know what ships are over there.  They were in the navy, so I don't know what ships are over there or anything.
R:  I have tried to keep up but a lot of the times I just give up.  It's one of these things where I don't want to know but I'm still curious so I look, sort of frequently, sometimes I wait a day or two before I look at any news.
L:  Do you think, um, they are -- like, withholding any information from us, you know --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- maybe the President or the media and --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Really? 
R:  Because I think that it's more than them just going over there doing peace keeping right now.  It's bound to be something more than that because I think they would have sent more than just two ships home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I really think they are.  They must be, there's no way that they could go through all of this without having any secrets for just protection reasons.
L:  Um, do you know if they ever did find Saddam? 
R:  No.
L:  They did not find him? 
R:  No, they did not.  There's no hard core evidence to prove that he's alive or dead or anything.  It's just pretty much up in the air.  People have said, "He was wounded" or someone had reported he was dead but that was never confirmed and they -- 
L:  I -- I personally think he's still alive.  I mean it's hard to tell but it's just my own little theory.  I think he is.
R:  Oh, I think he is too because they were talking about how he has underground living quarters and whatever else so he's bound to be.  They said, "He has living quarters that stretch out for miles underground" so there's no way that he could have just magically disappeared.
L:  Yeah, I mean there would have been a trace of him so I think he's alive.
R:  And the videos that they show on TV I think were pre recorded.  I'm not too certain that they were right then.
L:  Yeah, I heard about that from the beginning, ever since the very beginning of the war because they said, "That he had doubles" and then they got people in there to try and analyze it and maybe see if it was one of his doubles and it's pretty complicated.
R:  Yeah, and tough for the media too because they are trying to report but yet not give away too much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I know they sent several reporters out for giving away information.
L:  Yeah, Geraldo[?]. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know why he was there to begin with, but okay and then that other --
