L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Just fine.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Bookham[?], Washington.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, I have a sister that's visiting me here from Walla Walla.
R:  Cool.  So somewhat close.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm in, uh, Chicago suburbs.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- but I've been out there, I've been into Bookham, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh --
L:  So, what do you think about what's going on?
R:  Um ... [NOISE] I agree that they need peace --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  -- but being college student, we've kind of talked about this in some classes, and their lifestyles in the Middle East are different than what we have in America.
L:  True.
R:  And they kind of have, like, different traditions and values.  And one of the reasons we think there's so much conflict is because Americans are going there with their traditions and values that we have and not understanding they have different values, mainly like on the religious level --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if that makes any sense?
L:  Well, yeah, I -- I think -- yeah, I -- I think probably even the government leaders, you know, i- it's pretty obvious they have different traditions and values.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That -- that's really true.
R:  So -- and I don't that either side really understands what values the other one has and I think that's creating some conflict, because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's more, kinda, I think, the Middle East are like, "Why are you here?" to the Americans and not, l- like, I think there's a communication barrier that's causing a lot of problems.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure it would have to.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, they probably -- well, they've lived under tyranny for so long over there that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they're used to perhaps more violence than we prefer to put up with. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, nine eleven being the major, um, example. [LAUGH]
R:  Correct.
L:  You know, we're -- we don't want that to happen to us and, [SIGH] you know, I guess supposedly that was the reason we went over there, was because of [SIGH] potential problems that could come to us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as a result, you know?  So, [LAUGH] it -- it -- it certainly was a strange feeling to have the Americans be the aggressors this time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I --
R:  'Cause that's normally not the case. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  Normally we wait 'til we get hit first, and then we go after 'em --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [SIGH] I guess this time nine eleven was ... that was probably the d- -- the hit we took, and we're just not going to put up with it any more.  I guess that's the idea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, yeah, I -- I can see the -- I can see the point to that, you know, because regardless of whether or not they understand, you know, we don't want to get [LAUGH] creamed. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:   But, yeah, I mean they -- they, you know, they had other reasons too.  You know, since they were going over there to try to take care of potential terrorism on our soil, you know, they might as well -- in -- in the American opinion, might as well to try to, you know, free these people too, if they're going to have to take out S- Saddam anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, you can see why there would a lot of misunderstandings between the two groups.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  I think too they've done a good job, the soldiers are trying to only target the, kind of, government and the people who are making the choices we don't agree with in Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  Rather than just going and blowing up buildings that any innocent, like, resident of their country could be in that really doesn't have a say on what happens.
L:  Right.  And -- uh, you know, if they're going to use their own people for human shields [LAUGH] people are going to die.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  'Cause in order for us to accomplish the objective of taking out the -- the bad guys, if they're going to put innocent people, you know, as shields, those innocent people are going to get hurt --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unfortunately.  And, uh, awful lot of grief over there right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is really heartbreaking to think about.
R:  Do you think that there will ever be peace in that area or --
L:  Well, no, I don't really.  Until God himself intervenes.  I -- I believe that the Creator does have a plan for that area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that the Creator is going to bring peace, but I think he will be the only who can.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think, until then, there will be no peace.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it's just not a possible situation.  But, I think when he intervenes, then there will be.
R:  Yeah, I agree too.
L:  So --
R:  But it's kind of, like, I mean, obviously he has a plan that of course nobody understands, but --
L:  Well, actually, he has laid it out fairly well.  I mean, we don't understand all of it, but we understand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the basic parts, you know?  He has communicated enough to us to -- to give us a basic idea of what he's up to, but certainly not all the details. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  And, um, so that's the important thing, is to get what he -- what he has r- -- been willing to communicate to us.  It's very important, I think, to get that message --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- very firmly fixed.  Um, so ... uh, you know, it's been very good of him to -- to tell us what, you know, the important parts. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm happy he did that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, what year of school are you in?
R:  I'm a freshman this year.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So just starting off.
L:  Just got in there, huh?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah, I've got a daughter that's a -- a junior and a son --
R:  Uh, what school?
L:  -- that's a sophomore.  North Park University in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Oak Park -- I mean, in, uh --
R:  Illinois?
L:  Chicago.  In Chicago, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, in the city.  It's a --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- Swedish Covenant, um, private college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, and then I have a -- a son who's going to College of Dupage, which is a very large junior college in suburban Chicago.  I think --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's the second largest in the nation.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then I have a son who just graduated, uh, a yea- -- almost two years ago now from, uh, SAU Carbondale in Illinois, a- as a cop.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He's a cop now.  So, what are you --
R:  Oh, so you have a lot of college bills coming in, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, they have to pay their own bills, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we haven't been hit too hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So what college are you going to?
R:  Um, Eastern Washington University.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and you're a freshman there, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you staying in the dorms, then?
R:  I am.
L:  Yeah, very good.
R:  So ...
L:  So, I guess a lot of people have been watching the news a lot, huh, lately?
R:  Yeah, and we have, like, I'm in a world regional geography class, so we're studying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that quite a bit in the class and --
L:  That would be interesting.
R:  -- kind of how, like, even the landscape and kind of weather affects their lifestyles.
L:  Uh, right.  Oh, it would --
R:  So --
L:  -- absolutely would affect their lifestyle.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, no question, no question.  I don't know how they put up with all that sand. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that -- that would be really aggravating. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I guess they just get used to it, but --
R:  And I don't know if it's really that hot in Chicago or not, but it never really gets too hot in [inaudible].  So I don't how the heat -- 
L:  W- w- --
R:  -- how I could deal with the heat.
L:  What's hot -- what's hot to you?
R:  Like, in the hundreds.
L:  Yeah, well, that would be the same in Chicago.
R:  Cool. [LAUGH]
L:  But we -- we can get pretty humid.  I don't know if you guys get --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- humid.
R:  No, we get lots of rain.  Huh.
L:  But we get fairly humid.  Oh, do you?  So you have a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of humidity too?
R:  Well, not really.  'Cause it never gets hot enough to be humid.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  We just get the rain all year round, so --
L:  Oh, [LAUGH].  Well, we don't get rain all year round, we -- we get --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- well, actually, we get a pretty good mix of the four seasons.
R:  Cool.
L:  And, um, yeah, that's -- that works out pretty well.  We get some cold weather and we get some spring, and then we get some really hot weather --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then nice long falls.
R:  Cool.
L:  So, if you like four seasons Chicago's a good place to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, they say, you know, "If you don't like the weather, wait a minute, it'll change". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- so what's your major?
R:  Uh, marketing and business education.
L:  Oh, well, okay.
R:  So, basically I'll teach, like, marketing and business at the high school level.
L:  You want to teach it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's interesting.  So you just graduated from high school and you wanna go back there and teach the kids, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] While you still understand 'em, huh?
R:  In the same high school too. [LAUGH]
L:  Cool.  Cool.  Well, that's great.  So, do you have any siblings in college?
R:  Um, not in college.  I have one who's still in high school.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So, she's a junior.
L:  Oh, I see.  Well, that's good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, do you like dorm life?
R:  For the most part.  I mean, it can be loud at night.  But, overall I think it's a good way to meet people rather than just if you went to an apartment or something.
L:  Right, right, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, I like it.
L:  Well, that's good.  So how many of these, ah, studies have you done?
R:  Um, I think this is my fifth.
L:  Fifth?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I think this is my f- -- oh, it's my third or fourth.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm not sure.  I think it's my fourth actually, 'cause I was a little surprised the phone rang.
R:  I know, I was too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so they said three at first, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they keep calling, so that's fine with me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, have you got paid yet for any of them?
L:  No, I haven't yet.
R:  Okay, neither have I, so --
L:  So, I'll be happy to get the check.
R:  Oh yeah, ha.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I wonder what they're doing with this study?  That -- that would be real interesting.  How did you find out about it?  Through the college?
R:  Um, actually, I was just online one day and saw an advertisement on yahoo and clicked it, and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, I -- I got it on a mystery shopping message board.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I do that too for, um, different stores, um, Jan- -- I don't if it's, like, Jantzen Group, if you've ever heard of that one?
L:  Probably I have, yeah.
R:  Okay, I don't know how to pronounce it though, but they do, like, Ross and T.J. Max and Marshalls and a lot of stores like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I, um, don't think I've worked for Jantzen, but I think I might have signed up for 'em.
R:  Cool.
L:  But, uh, yeah, I just started about, I don't know, nine months ago, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's been kind of fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [SIGH] so, anyway, so what do you think about the rebuilding, should we --
