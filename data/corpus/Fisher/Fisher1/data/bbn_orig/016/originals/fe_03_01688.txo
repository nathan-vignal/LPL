L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Ryan.
L:  Pardon?
R:  I'm Ryan.
L:  Hi, I'm Deborah.  Glad to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.
L:  Well, we're supposed to talk about issues in the Middle East.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.  Do you think that this war or any soon coming war [LAUGH] is going to bring about peace in the Middle East?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't think it'll bring peace.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I did support the war when Bush first started because Saddam Hussein, in my eyes, he's a lot like Hitler was back during in World War Two --
L:  Right.
R:  -- killing his own people and causing just pain and suffering.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the United States, for the most part, supported their involvement in World War Two, and now they're complaining about the war in Iraq, but it's the same sort of situation.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I -- I think, um, I'm pretty much anti war, but I can't say that, um, I think our government did a terrible thing or anything, um, Hussein is an idiot and, you know, a -- a -- a true dictator and needs to be removed from power and I'm not sure they've accomplished it, but hopefully [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, hopefully.
L:  As far as long term peace, I don't think so.  I don't think we're ever going to see it our lifetimes in the Middle East.
R:  I don't think so either.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even if Saddam is put out of power, they're -- this whole generation of Iraqis has been raised in a dictatorship and I don't think they're going to be able to revert to democracy.
L:  Right, and a -- a lot of the Arab nations are still -- just cannot tolerate the existence of Israel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, that's -- you know, they just -- [LAUGH] I don't know why exactly, but I mean, I have my ideas, but they -- they just will not tolerate that little country there, so as long as they're there, there can't be peace among them.
R:  Yeah, and -- and I just don't know how that's going to end up working out, and I don't know how long, uh, the United States should take involvement in that.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I don't know either.  But I think -- it doesn't seem like they've quite mopped up, you know, the war totally, but once they do, I -- I can see where we have to be involved somewhat, or Hussein or somebody else is going to pop right up.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:   And I know that the, uh, Iraqis don't want to say -- well, they don't -- they just don't like us [LAUGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- even if we've helped them.  You know, they think -- they think of us as the great Satan and all, and, ah, I don't know, it seems as though, um, [LIPSMACK] they're going to fight us the whole way.  But I think, in the long run, we have to stay around at least a couple of months.  What do you think?
R:  Yeah, and see wh- -- see what we can, uh, try to accomplish, if anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Get some sort of peace making troops, see if they can do anything at all.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think that -- or, you know, maybe, I mean i- if the UN is finally willing to get involved, maybe the US should back out, let them handle it.
R:  I, uh, definitely agree about that.  The United Nations was created exactly for situations like this --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when there's large at world problems --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the countries were to unite and solve it.  And United States has gone over the UN boundaries in what they've done so far --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so if the UN is finally to cooperate, then we should definitely hand it over to them.
L:  I think so, for -- for a number of reasons, partly 'cause the Iraqis might be able to accept that better, because there are other Arab nations in the UN --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and also because, um, it won't be just the US, you know, they have an ugly face for us, and, um, I think until some other countries are involved, they're always going to feel like it's this imperialistic move by the US.
R:  Right.
L:  I wish we could somehow -- I -- I don't know to get this through to them, I- I think they think that we want Iraq, and we don't want Iraq [LAUGH] --
R:  We just want peace over there.
L:  -- we just don't want Iraq killing people.
R:  Right.
L:  I honestly think that they -- they feel like we want to conquer and have them as like, another state.  I can't think of anything worse.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I wouldn't -- I would not see the point in that either. [LAUGH]
L:  No, and I -- I guess, um, they -- they just don't trust us.  I think they hear so much propaganda that they -- they just don't trust Americans.
R:  Well, I guess I wouldn't really blame them.  I mean, it has been a long haul for them against us, and t- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't see how liberating them from Saddam Hussein is really going to change that at all. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah. Yeah, I [SIGH] -- they need some sort of democracy, and they are not trained for that, and I don't know how they'll manage.  They're used to doing everything by the bully method. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  But I think that even just having someone there for a little while, they might go along with it, let's say, but as soon as we --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pull out, they're going to somehow resort back to what they've been trained to do.
L:  That's what I'm afraid of.  But maybe the other Arab nations could have some input because they understand their mindset in a way that we cannot.
R:  Yes, 'cause we've never been exposed to this [MN] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kind of dictatorship.
L:  And, you know, and another Islamic nation that -- too, they need to hear from.  Um, I -- I -- I think they just cannot hear us, beca- -- I mean, because they don't want to, but they really, honestly cannot hear us.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So [LIPSMACK] well, I don't know.  How soon do you think the war will wrap up?
R:  Oh, gosh, I d- -- really don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  The more stuff seems to be coming up, and is Saddam gone, or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all this kind of stuff.  I mean, looking in probably a couple more months anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do you think about that?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know, I -- I think a couple of weeks could maybe do it, but, ah, maybe I'm just being too optimistic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I don't know that they'll tolerate us for months there, still fighting.  Uh, of course they can't stop us, but they can make a big outcry.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I don't know.  Y- you're right though, if they can find Hussein and his sons and whoever the -- his top leaders are, they'll wrap it up real fast.
R:  I had heard that, uh, Saddam had murdered his own sons, but I don't know if that was just a rumor, or -- 'cause I had heard it secondhand, not off the news --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and I don't know if this is true or not.
L:  That's interesting.  Why would he have, did they say?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] my source [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is just a manager at work, so not too reliable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but all the same, said, uh, they were doing something like, um, drinking American beverage or something, just, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a ridiculous reason.
L:  Oh.  And so it was just retribution?
R:  Right.
L:  That does sound like an urban legend, I'm afraid. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It could have happened, though.  Oh --
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH] I haven't watched the news in the last few days, so 
L:  Yeah.  I didn't, 'cause, um, I get so tired of it, and my husband was away fishing, but he's back now, so I'm sure I'll get all caught up. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But I saw enough of it to, you know, see that they felt we were nearly done, but then last night a young woman reporter was there, and I don't know if you happened to see that, but I mean, she kept looking behind her and finally she just said, "That's too close" and she kind of ducked down. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, I didn't catch that.
L:  So, they're still fighting. [LAUGH]. So  I think, by and large, the real thing is all done, the real fighting.
R:  I hope so, 'cause [MN] I -- I don't think that we went about it the right way, in Bush making such a large deal out of it --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and the -- the whole United Nations --
L:  What do you think would have been better?
R:  I really don't know. [LAUGH] I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how it would have been handled better, or how it could of, or if it --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- would have been different under Gore, or an- any of these other declarations by the people.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know, um, I tend to think that Gore, frankly, is kind of wimpy, so I don't think [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think -- I don't think he would have known what to do, and he'd have just followed advisors, but, um, as far as whether -- I -- it did seem like Bush just -- this was just -- he was itching to do this.
R:  I know, it did seem like he was just ready to get out there whenever he could and any reason.
L:  Yeah, and I'm -- and I'm -- but I'm not sure that he wasn't right [NOISE] you know?  I -- I mean, he -- he knows more information than we do and I think he was just feeling like, we have to do something and now is the best time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- so I -- I don't know, I don't know if he was right or wrong, but I -- I don't feel like it was an evil choice, anything like that.
R:  Oh no, I don't think so either.  Like I said, uh, it's been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- going on for such a long time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's been murdering his own people et cetera, et cetera, so 
L:  Right.
R:  It's about time someone stepped in.  And we tried the diplomatic method.
L:  Yeah, and who else could, really?  Pardon?
R:  Uh, we tried the diplomatic methods for years and years and years, ever since George's dad was president --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it did not work.  And --
L:  No, they don't respond.
R:  No, they don't at all, and I think the only way is to have them be bullied.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  By someone even larger than, uh, [LIPSMACK] Saddam himself.
L:  Yeah.  And I think that they honestly thought we would not do it.  And -- and so we might have had the advantage on that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they just -- he would talk about having these huge massive forces, well where are they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and, um, I think he just figured if he could convince us that he could actually fight us and if he could convince his own --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people that they cou- -- they would win and we would never win, that's all he needed to do, really.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then once the war started he couldn't hide behind that any more.  His -- his reputation is shot.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think so, yes.
L:  In that country.  Because those who hated him are now not afraid to say so.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And those who are kind of on the fence now s- they have to see that he was lying and saying, you know, "Oh, we could take the US" and all that.  A- and he would also have to see that, the people see that the Americans coming over there aren't harming them.  They're not, you know [LAUGH], they're not trying to bring in this loose morals or whatever they thought --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And none of that's happening.  So, his word is pretty much worthless and I -- I think they maybe actually know that now.
R:  Well, this is good.  It -- it is about time he gets out of power, and even if a dictatorship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- maybe just less of a destructive one.
L:  That's true, you can have --
R:  But that's a [several inaudible words].
L:  -- a benign dictatorship.  He's not benign though!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I'm -- I'm afraid they're so used to this that -- that somebody else with a lot of money and a very persuasive personality could lead them down a very similar path.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um
