R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Art.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm from New Jersey.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you are?  
L:  Uh, Wayne.  Last name is W.O.F.S.E.Y.
R:  Mhm.  Where you from Wayne?
L:  Uh, Stanford, Connecticut.
R:  Oh, okay, we're not too far away.  So, the topic of the day is the Middle East, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, do you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, at least it's -- at least it's, uh, timely, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, well, I guess we're supposed to talk on the subject, uh --
L:  Yeah, um, you -- you wanna ask me questions, or you wanna just hear how I feel?
R:  Sure.  What've you got to say?
L:  Oh, I'm -- I don't -- I'm not happy that we s- got into this, but I guess since we're there, might as well stick around and clean it up, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that, uh, Bush is kinda opening up a -- getting the US in a l- lot of -- uh, what's -- what's the next country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm not in favor of the war, but since we're there, [NOISE] I guess we've got to deal with it. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I kinda feel similar.  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I wasn't happy about it.  You know, I grew up during the Vietnam conflict, so I knew what that was like and, um, I'm, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not too crazy about war.  But, like you said, now that we're there we might as well finish the job --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and do it right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, I don't know what that means. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I guess it --
R:  I mean, I don't --
L:  -- means not -- not, uh turning[?] -- and I'm a c- -- a little concerned that the US has got political reasons to -- to put, uh, our -- our companies in there and -- and it's gonna get a lot of the other [LAUGH] countries angry, but who knows what's gonna happen? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, well, I -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my biggest concern is that they're sitting there thinking --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that -- they wanna put in a democratic regime.
L:  Yeah, but I don't think these people want that. [NOISE]
R:  I don't disagree with you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't -- I don't think that they know what democracy is.
L:  No, no, and then --
R:  I mean, uh, they don't have a history --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- of democracy.  They have never lived under a democracy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, they don't seem to be -- they don't seem to be open to new ideas and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and let's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- face it, uh, there was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- an interesting article --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in my local paper today that said, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, they're all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- arguing that they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they wanna blend --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  -- religion with politics.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And democracy, unfortunately --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seems to -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- requires just the opposite.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- strong about the idea that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, you know there should be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a jep- -- a separation between --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- Church and State and, uh --
L:  Oh, [NOISE] --
R:  So --
L:  I think, um, that we got -- that -- I think a lot of this has to do with Israel [NOISE], um, oil [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, [NOISE] probab- -- to me the -- the way they should've gone about it is sitting down and trying to discuss this instead of --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- coming on the way they did, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] --
R:  No.
L:  -- who knows if Bush didn't do this so that he stays in office longer, you know?
R:  You never [LAUGH] --
L:  I think he's making a mess of our economy.
R:  Yeah, you never know what their, uh, motivations --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Except that, uh, unfortunately, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, a hundred and fifty young folks have lost their lives because of this and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we don't think about that much, do we?  Except that, uh, ca- -- even --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- even the, uh, the television stations aren't talking about that much any more, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In the beginning it was, "Well, we -- you know, four -- you know, four Marines were shot today" and now, you're not even hearing that.  And then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I heard today that what, the Marines moved out of Baghdad?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's been taken over by the Army and, uh -- and if the, um -- the -- the protests that are going on over there are any indication, they don't want us there a- either.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's -- that's probably right.
R:  [LAUGH] But we're there and I guess we've gotta finish the job.  Looks like some of the, uh, the language towards Syria has kinda calmed down a little bit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, but then again that's the same way it started with Iraq, you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, they didn't do -- you know, I -- obviously the UN didn't feel that they did a very good ca- -- uh, d- a very good job of building their case.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  'Cause it would've been nice had we had the UN backing --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I agree. [NOISE]
R:  -- to go in there and -- maybe that's what we oughta do.  Let's let the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- UN -- 'cause the UN is good at --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that kinda stuff, you know.  And -- and did you see the other thing in there that they -- they wanna -- there's five bases that they want to have access to in Iraq?
L:  Uh-huh.  That -- that the US wants, or --
R:  Yeah.  I think that's what this is all about.  I think -- as much as anything else, I think they want a presence in the Middle East where they can go in and, you know, and have a base there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which means we're gonna have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  Military there --
R:  -- thirty thousand, forty thousand troops there for who knows how long.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I don't know if they'll ever achieve their final goal of -- of -- of getting a democratic State.  You know, as much as I -- Saddam Hussein was not a very nice man --
L:  Yeah.
R:  He did make one very interesting comment.  He said that Ir- [LAUGH] -- Iraq is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a country made up of -- of various tribes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the only way you can control them is with a strong hand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, if you think about it and I've said this to other people.  I don't know how you feel about this, but maybe the worst thing that ever happened was the breakup of the Soviet Union.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems they -- for some reason they were able to control all this stuff by --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by keeping it tightly under control.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, it's like a lot of people in the Soviet Union are not happy [NOISE].  That they liked it before -- better before.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, look --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you're not used to democracy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you're not used to a free market system --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and someone has essentially, [SIGH] you know, created a welfare state, where you're given food, you're given shelter, you're essentially given a job --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Why would you wanna go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- under some other system?  And -- and, you know, I mean --
L:  Well, it's just like within the US.  Every State has different, uh, you know, governments and setup, so they do things differently.  In California, does that mean we need to change, you know? [NOISE]
R:  That's right.  Does it need to be --
L:  Same -- same idea.
R:  -- different in Connecticut?  R- Right, you're, you know, you're north of us, you do things --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- you have different laws than we have.  I mean --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  What --
L:  [NOISE] The other -- the other thing [NOISE] that bothered me is when -- I don't know if you remember [NOISE] when, um, Giuliani -- the Prince of Saudi Arabia came to give a check --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, Giuliani rejected it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was kind of the -- the US made it sound like he was trying to give us dirty money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I thought that was his way of saying that we need to look at our position in the Middle East and that's why [NOISE] everything happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the US just totally ignored that and turned it around that, uh, he was -- he was -- almost like what he did was a bad thing and I -- I was kinda of disgraced at that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I think that was an important moment.
R:  Yeah, I hear you.  Mm.
L:  A lot of people didn't -- didn't perceive it that way, but that's the way I saw it.
R:  Well, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, sort of --
L:  'Cause obviously these people attacked us because they had a -- they -- they felt they had a reason to.  You know, I don't think that what they did was right --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I don't think what we turned around and did is any better and I think for, uh, adults to try to tell their children, uh, "Don't go hit -- hit somebody 'cause they hit you", wh- what are we doing?  
R:  Mm, yeah --
L:  You know.
R:  -- it's an interesting thought.  I hadn't thought about it that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh -- well, you know, w- we -- we do tend to have a little bit of a bad habit of not listening to other people.  We think our way is the y- -- is the right way and the only way and, uh, um, if someone does come up with an idea sometimes if it isn't -- you know, it's sort of like, uh, not invented here --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- syndrome, if you know what I'm talking about?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it -- you know, well, if we didn't invent it then it must not be right, so, but, uh -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- you know, I don't know --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I mean, y- -- I don't know.  The Iraqis -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I -- let's li- -- you know, if we keep it at the best level and we say, "Okay, the reason that we went in there was to give these people freedom" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They didn't ask for it though.
L:  I -- I -- that's BS because that's not why we went in there.  That's what we had to say because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because what if we got in there and didn't find anything?
R:  Well, we still haven't found anything.
L:  Well, we're trying everything to pull these scientists out and -- and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- get them to admit that there was stuff there -- and maybe there was, but I think they had plenty of time to get rid of whatever they had.
R:  Yeah, exactly, or it's underground, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Syria, or who knows were, or something --
L:  Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry, can you hang on one second?  I'm getting a phone call.  I'll be right back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  [several inaudible words] Ugh.  Ooh. [PAUSE]
L:  Okay, I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH] It's all right.  But, uh, I don't know.  I -- I -- you know, I don't know -- I mean, there is -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what, there is a couple of countries there, uh, that have some sense of democracy.  I guess what?  Turkey and, uh, what is it, Qatar?  Is that how it's pronounced?
L:  Yeah, Qatar.
R:  Qatar --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, they have some semblance of a, uh -- but even Kuwait.  I mean, you know, we went in and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- got Saddam out the first time and I'm not so sure -- I mean, I know they let us put our ...
