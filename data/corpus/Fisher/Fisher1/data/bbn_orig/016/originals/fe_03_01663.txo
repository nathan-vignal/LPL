L:  Hi.
R:  Um, hi.  Ah, my name's Molly.
L:  Hi, my name is Marlene. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, Marlene.
L:  Right.  And I -- and I live in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, ah, I live in New York originally but I'm schooling in Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about the Middle East today.
R:  Yeah, fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, it's better than nine eleven, I think. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That one was a hard one for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I guess my feelings are I'm not sure if we should even be involved with the military there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, I don't know.  Like, what do you think?  Do you -- because I'm -- I have my own theory about it but when I talk about it people start getting very, very angry.
L:  Yeah, well, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just -- I'm wondering if -- if our true reason for going in was because of Saddam Hussein --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or if it was because of the oil --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and Saddam's mistreatment of people, you know, and it was sort of like being a bully.
R:  Right.
L:  "You don't, um, do it the way we want, we'll crush you" that type of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that -- and I -- I just have some feelings about that.  I'm not sure what we should have done or what we should do.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, how do you feel?
R:  I think we got really, really lucky that the war went by very quickly, that the people were very willing to put their arms down and not get killed for it, and that now this, like, reconstruction is coming through relatively smoothly.  We're also very lucky that it's starting to slowly get the economy and so people are starting to focus on the right things now.  But I think we -- also think we should not have gone in in the first place.  This is just like, okay, you may have won the battle but you haven't won the war kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because of the initial reasons that Bush was even saying that we were going to go into the war was for terrorism, and he still has not made any link that puts terrorism with Iraq or even Saddam.
L:  E- exactly.  An- my feelings exactly.  Um, yeah, [LAUGH] that's what I -- that's what I said, you know, sort of like a bully because -- I just -- I [NOISE] -- yeah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I agree with you.
R:  It's j- just really lucky that he has very intelligent people behind him because this is basically other than a boy's whim turned into, ah, like oil.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Which I totally cannot stand that.  But, like, a- we're here we are now and we're here at the point where the so called war is over, although he cannot find Saddam.  Chances are he's probably been, like, retired in some island somewhere.  Be like, "Oh, thanks, you've done your job".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] But, like, I think once of that, now that you've started your process it's also good to finish it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So now that they're here I think, yes, they should do their best with helping the Iraqi people instill their own kind of rule and law the way they want it, and then leave.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  I agree.  Um, I think we need to do some help but I think we need to get out of there in a timely fashion as well.
R:  Agreed. 
L:  We don't have to push democracy or our --
R:  Right.
L:  -- our thing of living on -- on this country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think, um -- I think, you know, the Middle East -- well, he -- he -- he -- he was an evil man, I think you'll agree with me there.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  But, um, let the Iraqi people deal with this as best as they can.
R:  I know.
L:  And, um, the- --
R:  I mean --
L:  They're sitting on this oil and I think w- they maybe need to be educated but I -- I think, you know, they were doing just fine before Saddam took power and I think there's educated people over there.
R:  Right.
L:  Most of them have probably been educated in the United States,
R:  Ha, just like Saddam. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.  So we don't have to think that th- these bumbling backwards people.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I know.  Like, even just to go on -- I remember when the war was going on where people like, "Will they make it?  Will they not make it?"  And then how they were just hitting on Iraqis like they were animals who jus- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, even I think I hear over there some stories of, ah, Iraqis getting shot up when people are looting, or trying to like get some together, or there was some kind of guerilla warfare going on in between there.  But I think, ah, it's important to note that even though we've come in and we've helped these people who have been under oppression for quite a while +now.  Like, every third world country, although they've been under a certain condition, these people still have minds and feelings.
L:  E- right, right.
R:  So you can't go around, like, treating them like animals.  We're like, "Okay, we're going to come up here and save you and do whatever we want".
L:  Right and --
R:  Which I think --
L:  You know, even as far as the looting, it should not have been done.  We both, ah, agree on that.
R:  Mm.
L:  But would that not have happened in the United States as well?
R:  [LAUGH] Good point.
L:  A- a- you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  That is true.
L:  Y- we don't have -- you know, we don't have to portray the whole country as being looters --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and all this but I think it would have happened here.  Look what happened at the riots.  And how many times hasn't it happened around --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the United States.
R:  Right.  I mean --
L:  So.
R:  People are no different.  Even though, like, we have thankfully more technology and a better period of living and many Americans think, "Oh, my life is this and that" but compared to other countries and the people that live there, it's actually pretty well off.
L:  Right.
R:  And then when you start, like, thinking, "Oh, we're much better than them" in reality you're not because a human person is a human person.  You can say whatever you want but you're not going to change.
L:  I think that's part of the reason the United States is not well liked, is our ego.  We go overseas, we go to another country and we kind of, ah, quote unquote, throw our weight around and think --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- "I'm from the United States, bow down to me" or --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  Or, um, you know, "I deserve preferential treatment".
R:  Right.  I'm sort of an international person myself.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] So, um, I -- I see both sides 'cause I've lived --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- outside America for a long time and I've lived inside America for a long time.
L:  Okay.
R:  Actually eight years each to be exact.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  But, I mean, like, just looking -- you're right, what you're saying.  Like, there are Americans who are intelligent, they see what's going on.  Like they're -- they're of the p- the point of view that, like, "Okay, this is who we are but there are also other people who have their other cultures and understandings and we should respect them for it".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  This is really funny 'cause when I first came here, like, a lot of people were all about, "Respect me, respect me, respect me, respect me".  It was like a catchphrase.  Every single TV show h- had the words respect in it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, like, over here right now, the actions that they're doing, that the government is saying and how the government is representative of the population, what they're doing is not respectful.
L:  No, I agree.  Ah, they're kind of forcing, aren't they?
R:  Mm.  I mean, it's just, I don't know.  Like d- -- ah, well, spoils my point.  I mean, like, just coming from the outside and coming from the inside, there have been some Americans who are just like, "Oh, this is who I am".  And 'specially, unfortunately before September eleventh that was on the rise.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They were totally there, like, going, "Oh, we don't care, this, that".  I mean, there's sort of less now.
L:  Right.
R:  B- but with this, like, um, war being, like, successful and everything, I really hope people won't make the mistake of starting to -- start being big again.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because those terrorist groups are still out there.  Although they're not doing anything right now, they might get irked into doing something else.
L:  You think they've kind of gone underground?
R:  Oh yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, I don't know what else they're doing, nor do I want to, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they're probably gonna wait 'til things have calmed down and everyone's, like, going, "Nah, nah, nah" again, then they'll probably --
L:  Right.
R:  -- find some other way of doing it.
L:  Do you think nine eleven alerted us to the fact that these people are out -- are out there and hate the US as much as they do?
R:  Yes, but in the wrong way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In the beginning it was -- it was like -- it was sort of decent in that we were all thinking, "Why?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, and then once we found the answer it seems that half of us didn't accept it and went the other way, while the other were like, "Oh" and stopped to think about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If only we had kind of like stopped to think about it more and be like, "Well, maybe we should see why as -- and as -- as we've been preaching of democracy and everything and started talking about it --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then maybe that won't -- there would have been such a rush.  But at the same time, with all that bloodshed going on, I even spoke to someone next to me who had seen -- who was so close to the building that they saw the color of the shoes of the person falling off of the building.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yes, it was, like, that bad.  I mean, f- for that kind of thing to happen, yes, they had to be punished.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But by God.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Like, i- it would -- it will happen to them, believe me.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, but the way we went around it, it wasn't that good.
L:  Right.  So, anyway.  I c- [MN] it's unreal to me that I found someone who -- who agrees with my views because out here I think -- I'm almost scared to admit some of these things because it's so totally --
R:  Really.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, in Minnesota I could imagine.
L:  Well, [LAUGH] and, you know, a lot of these things don't really -- ah, where we live, I'm in rural Minnesota, have -- have no -- they- they- they're honest but we are [MN] relatively out of danger.
R:  Mm.
L:  If you can understand.  I mean, who wants to come and bomb something here?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's nothing here to -- you know, [LAUGH] really.
R:  Yeah, that's true. 
L:  So I think that has put us -- some people out of touch with reality.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, anyway.  Have you --
R:  That's true.
L:  Um, [MN] so what else were we supposed to talk about?  I forgot already.
R:  Mm, that's true.  Oh, my.  But, I mean, oh no, it's kind of hard since you've -- since you're in the place where, like, it's supposed to be really safe and you have your communities and everyone kind of thinks along, like, a similar fashion.  And just trying to, like, think different from other people.  I think, yeah, I -- I definitely understand that.
L:  Mm [LAUGH] yeah.  It's -- it's a small rural community and I think that makes a difference.  But, you know, I -- I still think of this thing about the war that maybe we nee- needn't have gone in.  I'm glad it's over with so.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I'm +glad -- glad the loss of life was +minimal.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm glad the technology was there that, um, loss of life could be minimized an- and, you know, this really was a seven, eight day war.
R:  Mm.
L:  Instead of four years, like the previous world wars have been.
R:  True.
L:  And, um, I wasn't real pleased with the media being almost there before the rest of the people were there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that also bothered me, [LAUGH] very much so.
L:  Um, [MN] I thought they could have kept some things separate and we didn't need to know as much as we knew.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I mean, like, if it was something in terms of the media that was kind of unfair and bad, tha- that's what the media's supposed to be for, to make sure things are equalized.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But then to go out and exploit every single angle just to get more ratings, I think was actually disgusting.
L:  Right, right.  And, you know, I- I'm also one
