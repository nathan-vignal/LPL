L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hey, this is Neil Patel.
R:  Neil?
L:  Yes.
R:  This is Sharon from Minnesota.
L:  Oh, hi, Sharon.  I'm, uh, here in Texas.
R:  In Texas?  Oh, great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, what is the topic?  I didn't catch that real quick.
L:  It was about airport security.  Does, uh, increasing airport security lessen the chance of terr- a terrorist attack or a hijacking or something like that.  Yeah, I didn't get it too.
R:  Okay, that's what I kind of thought it was but I wasn't real positive.  How do you feel about that?
L:  Well, I mean, I -- I like -- I like the -- I like at least most of the effects.  I mean, I -- I don't like some of the effects that it's taken on 'cause really the whole -- the whole airline industry has gone down 'cause of all this heightened security and increased fares and, you know, all this -- all these taxes that've been added on for the nine eleven fees and -- and such, so ... but I think -- I think it -- in the end it does make us safer, so I mean, I g- --
R:  And I think it does -- I think it does scare some of 'em. [NOISE]
L:  It does scare some of 'em off, exactly and it just shows 'em, but I guess that just gives them more time to plan maybe, so, um, I guess I -- it's -- it's a good thing actually.  I mean, all these -- all these steps that are -- I -- I'm willing to pay a small price for -- for my safety, especially in -- in -- in an airplane.
R:  Evidently, right, because there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] We understand that [LAUGH].  There's no way of fleeing that.  Uh, you're right, except that one time when we went on the plane, all they searched our luggage and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and when we got to our destination, um, my husband looked in the side pocket and here was a little tiny jack knife that they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- hadn't even found and so sometimes -- but then that's --
L:  Well --
R:  -- been like two years ago, so I think since then that their security has been, uh, upgraded a whole lot --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I mean they've got people now that are -- know what they're doing and looking for and then --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Before that you had people that -- I could do a better job if you [LAUGH] -- if you just give me the right training, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and [inaudible].  Most -- half of 'em don't even speak english, so I mean, you know, they're -- I mean at least --
R:  It was whoever they could hire and now I think it's -- it's stepped up a whole lot more.
L:  And definitely higher standards now and I mean that's a good thing.  I mean the whole [inaudible] security department I think it's a -- it's -- it might not be the -- it might not be, you know --
R:  Convenient.
L:  Convenient, but --
R:  It's not convenient for a person and it's more expensive.
L:  Definitely, and I think that's -- that might be a little -- that might be a prob- -- I think that's the big problem right now on all these airli- -- airli- -- yeah, yeah, these big airlines like American, Delta, United, they're filing -- filing for bankruptcy 'cause of just heightened security measures.  You don't -- people don't want to wait two hours [MN] in the airport terminal just to -- just to get strip searched or, you know, or the bag xrayed or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and -- it's sad that a lot of these -- a lot of these --
R:  We had to go to these extent --
L:  'Scuse me?
R:  It's sad that we had to go to this extent.
L:  Yeah, and that we do have -- sometimes have to profile and, I mean -- I mean that's -- that's kind of sad but I think -- I think it's -- they're not doing the wrong thing [LAUGH].
R:  No.
L:  Profiling people but --
R:  I appreciate the --
L:  I just --
R:  -- precautions and you just have to --
L:  I just hope it doesn't -- yeah.
R:  Pardon me?  You have to what?
L:  I just hope it doesn't, it doesn't go too far with people's -- people's individual rights, you know.  But other than that I think you -- you might have to -- you might have to discriminate just a bit to help us out -- [LAUGH] help -- help the general cause out [LAUGH].
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe.
R:  And -- 
L:  It's a sad thing.
R:  -- and I notice they make a lot more people take their shoes off now and just check their shoes and --
L:  Oh, yeah, mhm, especially --
R:  -- their computers and everything and, uh, it's -- like I say it's inconvenient but I just appreciate the precaution and at least ... and they're searching -- here in Minnesota they search a lot of cars when you come into the airport, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's -- that's not really convenient so it's, you know, it takes longer so you -- you have to plan so much further ahead, you know.
L:  Definitely -- definitely --
R:  More time, but --
L:  I give myself at least two hours and I'm just flying from Dallas to Houston or Dallas to Austin and I give myself two hours, so it is getting -- before I used to have to, you know  just go thirty minutes before, you know, just to make sure that if I run into traffic or anything.  Huh.
R:  Now, I've been to Houston quite a few times to the airport there and that's really huge.  Do they do a lot of precautions there?
L:  [COUGH] Um, actually Dallas is I think -- I think is worse [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  'Cause Dallas is -- I think it's like it's a really busy airport and so like -- so that you have a lot of -- you have a lot of, uh, transfers and incoming flights more than, you know, more than, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- flights leaving so, [COUGH] I think -- I think -- I don't know they -- they just make sure -- they just make sure that -- that -- I don't know there's -- I heard something that their -- the safety record is really bad Dallas Fort Worth, so I think they've -- they've really stepped it up.  So, but, yeah, Dallas is, I think, much worse than Houston [LAUGH].
R:  Right, I -- I -- I do think they could be a lot [MN], you know, check a lot better than they do, but then I guess we pay a bigger price again too. [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah, all these fares are going up [MN].  I mean, I -- I remember I bought a ticket and it's like nine dollars for nine eleven fee and it's expensive [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Pretty -- so, it's a pretty heavy tax [LAUGH] right there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I mean, if, I mean, I guess -- I don't know where that money goes, so [LAUGH], I just hope it's going in the right hands so, it's just --
R:  Well, they're laying so many people off at North West I was -- you know, I don't know if -- but then I suppose there aren't that many people flying like they used to be either.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Oh, I -- it's -- it's -- it's pretty bad --
R:  But I suppo- I suppose that nine dollars is going to pay for all this extra security, so --
L:  Let's just hope it does. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  The government doesn't always have the best track record in accounting --
R:  And how do you -- how do you feel about the pilots now?  They were showing last night on the TV here in Minnesota that -- uh, they were showing 'em how to, um, target shoot and carry guns and --
L:  Well, I think, I, well -- from what I hear a good majority of the pilots are navy trained -- are from the navy.
R:  Oh, they are.
L:  So, yeah, that's what it -- that's w- it's something -- it's a really big number actually.  It's -- it's most of the pilots a- actually and so like -- I mean, I -- I mean they've -- they've had the training.  They've -- they've had the field tr- training in the navy or -- or airforce or something like that, so -- I mean, I can -- I can trust them.  I can trust the pilots, you know, they're s- they're soldiers, they're ex soldiers, I guess, I mean if you want to call 'em that, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they've been trained in this kind of stuff, in killing, so I mean -- let's just hope they don't miss [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, they don't shoot a window out.  Let's just hope that, but other than that I -- I mean I trust them.  I trust them with guns.  I mean, [SIGH] let's just -- let's hope they n- never have to use it, but --
R:  Right.  Oh, I don't know what they -- what else they could do to step up this security, um ...
L:  I think -- I think right now is the safest time to travel, but [SIGH] especially --
R:  Oh, you do think --
L:  Especially, I mean, especially after all -- after we -- what we saw in nine eleven [LAUGH].  I mean, this is -- it just -- I think -- I think in- including all this heightened security and -- and, uh, and just overall awareness, I think it just makes us safer -- a little bit more safer in the air than we were ni- September tenth, two thousand and one, I think, but I mean there's always a chance.  There's al- there are people out there that believe in their cause and they -- they really don't care how they get their job done but they just get it done, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that's a bigger problem [LAUGH], not the --
R:  They're just showing on the TV here right now the pilots, um, target ...
L:  Oh, really?  What -- is it ABC?  CNN?
R:  What is channel four here?  I don't even know -- no, it's -- it's our local station, so --
L:  Oh, it's a local station?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay. [NOISE] That would've been interesting.
R:  But the pilot's union is -- what are they saying about us? [NOISE] Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, forty five pilot- [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Only forty five pilots are certified to, um, carry guns for North West.
L:  Oh, really?  And it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- out of how many pilots?  Do you -- if you know?
R:  It [NOISE] -- It doesn't say --
L:  Doesn't say?
R:  -- or I mean I can barely hear it 'cause I've got it turned on so low. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  So, uh --
L:  But that's surprises me .  I think -- I think more pilots would have gun training at least if they were trained in the navy, but -- I mean, I trust -- I trust them.  I mean, that's just another -- that's just another addition to one of their jobs, so -- the job, so, I'm willing to pay a little extra just to feel a little -- just have that peace of mind, I guess.
R:  Like I said in the beginning --
L:  In that --
R:  -- I think they probably make who's ever going to do it think twice before they, uh, hijack or whatever and --
L:  Exactly, definitely.  Air marshalls.  I think air marshalls is a very good thing to have too.  That'd be -- that'd make me feel -- that'd give me at least some really, really big sense of security I guess, but I think that -- that costs way too much if you had it on every flight, so I think they need a -- maybe like cross country flight, you know, cross continent continental flights maybe that -- that'd be wise but maybe little flights from Dallas to Austin, you know, thirty minutes, I don't think that'd be wise.
R:  But I guess the sad thing is when -- when we used to go to the airport your family could go to the -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right to the terminal with you practically --
L:  [NOISE] Inside the terminal, yeah.
R:  Yes, and now it's --
L:  Yeah, we can't even park --
R:  -- leave you at the door and that's it.
L:  -- you know, within a hundred feet of the terminal, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really inconvenient now, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Let's just hope these airlines can get it together and --
R:  Well, I don't know much --
L:  -- help our economy out there.
R:  Yeah, I mean if they start going ...
