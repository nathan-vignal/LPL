R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, my name's Linda.
L:  I'm Carol.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, Carol.  I'm in Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Brigham City, Utah. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Whoa, long way away. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [COUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Boy that -- they gave us a pretty good subject, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, they did. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, do I think peace will ever be achieved?  Probably not in our lifetime.
L:  [MN] And I hadn't really thought about it.  I think you're right.
R:  I think it will --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- someday.  I hopefully think someday it will be.  But, I mean, how do you solve something that's been going on for, what, three thousand years?
L:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.  You're right. [LAUGH]
R:  I think we're -- I think we're on the right road to it.
L:  Yeah, I -- I know.  I th- it's definitely better than it was. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think, you know, standing up against --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- terrorism is -- is -- is pretty -- a pretty big thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I don't know.  I think a lot of it depends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- upon too also on how the situation is going on right now resolves itself and is turned o- and turns out.
L:  Yes.
R:  I think that's gonna make a big difference.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [MN] boy, [LAUGH] I don't know [inaudible] --
R:  I know, they overwhelmed us. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, there's not --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Not a whole lot to, you know, to -- to say on this.  There's so -- so much -- I don't know.  I haven't even heard if they've figured out how they're gonna set the government over there. [NOISE]
R:  Well -- well they -- apparently they want to guide.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  Give me the book.
R:  -- not take over the government.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] Get me the book you're using.
R:  I think they -- they want the country to develop its own government.
L:  Right.
R:  Which I think is the best way to go.
L:  Yes.  Yes, I [NOISE] -- otherwise they'll [COUGH] resent the United States. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, their fundamental beliefs are totally different than -- than ours.  Look at the different fundamental beliefs that we have here.
L:  Right.
R:  And they have basically one belief there.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's true.
R:  And we have many.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And we can't push --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- our beliefs on them.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  Oh.
R:  You have a little one.
L:  I [LAUGH] -- yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A couple of 'em.
R:  Well, we have a brand new we- three week, ah, [MN] well, be four weeks the twenty fifth.
L:  Oh my word.
R:  Grandson, grandson.
L:  Oh.
R:  Our first. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, how exciting. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] We are in love. [LAUGH]
L:  I bet, I bet.
R:  So ...
L:  Ah, my oldest is soon to be twenty two next month. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And my youngest is five. [LAUGH]
R:  Whoa.  [LAUGH] You have a -- yeah, you got a big spread there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least you'd have some help. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I had some breaks in between.  I have five kids.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, you got your hands full.
L:  But I only have three left at home now so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Their -- they grow up too fast.
L:  They do, they do.
R:  Yep, they're there and they're gone.  But, you know what, the joys that we have with our children and the things we can do with our children, they can't do over there.
L:  That's true. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Wouldn't it be nice if the whole world had the freedoms to do th- the things that we do?  And, you know, we can stand up and we can say what we believe in and unless we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- threaten somebody's life or do something illegal, we're not going to jail for it.
L:  That's true, yeah.
R:  They die for it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So ...  And I hope Sa-
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I hope Saddam Hussein is gone.
L:  [NOISE] I'm sorry I can't hear your last statement. [LAUGH]
R:  I said I hope S- Saddam Hussein is gone.
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH] I think -- I don't know.  I'm --
R:  Oh my God, the more I hear about him and his sons, the more it's -- they're -- oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Did you see that special that Oprah Winfrey had about a month ago?
R:  I've seen -- yeah, I've seen several that she's had.
L:  But did you see the one of Saddam Hussein?  It was really interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Was it showing the castles and --
L:  [MN] Um, yeah.
R:  -- his palaces and --
L:  Yeah.  And she talked about how he really thought Hitler was [MN] a great person. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH] It was, ah, you know, when I was watching this I thought, "Oh, my word".  I had -- had absolutely no idea. [LAUGH]
R:  He describes the word masochist [MN] and +sadist.
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  And a few other things.  Ah, I don't think the man or his sons, any of 'em, I think they were loony tunes [LAUGH] actually.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  And it's -- it's, I don't know.  It's hard to say how they got that way. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  His -- his -- even his -- the one wife was saying what a horrible person he was and stuff and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  So it's -- it's -- you know, the people lived in fear of him.  And, oh my God, every t- every place you looked there was a picture of the man.
L:  Yes, [LAUGH] that was -- that was a little bit of a --
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, didn't he get tired of looking at himself? [LAUGH]
L:  He apparently had, um, a TV -- the TV station had to have his favorite things on every day.  They'd have to have either his favorite kinds of music or, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, different cultural art things that he enjoyed.  It had to be on, um, [NOISE] yeah, every day.  [MN] And he had to have his picture on the front page of the paper every day.
R:  Isn't that sad?
L:  And it, you know, m- makes you wonder how somebody gets to be like that, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  And, you know, you se- -- the kids -- how many generation- -- you know, he's been in power, what, forty years?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How many generations have been raised to believe that this is okay and worshipping him is -- is okay?  And th- that's because they don't know any better.  They don't know they don't have to.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  So, it's just, mm, just makes my skin crawl.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, how lucky --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we are to be raised here.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] Yes, we are, definitely lucky.
R:  Yeah, very lucky.  When you see something like that we know how lucky we are.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So -- and I just -- I don't know, I think George Bush is doing a good job of it.
L:  [NOISE] He is, he is.  I -- I, ah, wasn't real sure how he was going to handle things but I think he's -- [NOISE] he's doing good things [inaudible].
R:  He's cleaning up his daddy's mess.  I mean, I think the world of his daddy, I liked his daddy.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I loved his mother. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think Barbara Bush is one of the neatest --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- people in the world.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, I just, ah -- you know, a lot of people don't agree with me but I said I'd love to sit down and have coffee with that woman. [LAUGH]
L:  She's -- she seems like a really down to earth person. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Neat lady, yeah, yeah.  Really neat.
L:  Sh- she would have been a good President. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know what?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think Laura would be too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  I like Laura.
L:  I do too.  I do --
R:  I like Barbara and I like Laura.  Now, if we hadn't of had Hillary in between. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I was just going to say, you know, if we --
R:  I don't care for --
L:  -- just could forget the last presidency. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't care for her too much. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.
R:  No.  And I hope she doesn't decide to run for President. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, well ... [LAUGH]
R:  We don't need another Clinton in the White House.
L:  No, no.
R:  So ...  But no I -- I -- you know, it's not his dad's fault.  He did not -- he did not real- -- I mean, what -- if he had hindsight it would be a different, you know --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- d- different thing.  But, you know, a lot of people lost their lives because he didn't go -- keep going through Baghdad and onto the Turkish border.
L:  Ah huh.
R:  And he let an awful lot of people down and then they wonder why they don't trust Americans at this point in time.  Well, we're gonna have to earn their trust.  We lost it.  We left them to hang out and dry.
L:  Yeah. [MN] [NOISE]
R:  So ...  We're not liked in a lot of places.  Well, that's the way the old cookie crumbles.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They like our money.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and any help we can do. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  They like our money, they like ou- -- they like all our aid, they like all of our medicine, our -- our -- our farming help.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They like all of that but they don't like us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, what else do we come up with on this subject?
L:  [MN] I don't know.  Have you done one of these before?
R:  Yes, this is my third one.
L:  Oh, this is my third one too.  I think --
R:  Is it?
L:  I think the main thing is they just want us to keep talking. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I did -- my other ones were on sports.
L:  Oh, that- that's what my last one was.  And I can't remember what my first one was.
R:  Both of mine were on sports.
L:  Oh.
R:  One was on the strikes and one was on the pay.
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  So ...
L:  So have you gotten any checks from doing this?
R:  Not yet, but I've only signed up for less than a week.
L:  Oh.  I, um [MN] -- I just did one the other day but my first one was quite a while ago.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But, um
