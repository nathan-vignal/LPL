R:  Hi, my name's Linda.  I'm from St Angelo, Texas.
L:  Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
R:  Nice to meet you, Sarah.
L:  Nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
R:  I think that we need to stay involved in the Middle East until the situation settles out.  Ah, [MN] what do you think?
L:  Um, I have mixed feelings about it.  I kind of think that it's important for us to play a role but I worry about charging in and trying to do too much, rather than having more of a guidance role in terms of going in with military action and things like that.
R:  Well, I think that -- that, um, the military action was needed at the time that -- that we went in.  I think now we need to have less of, um, a military stance.  I think the military still needs to be involved like they are, but I don't think that, um, [MN] we need to -- to make it -- make them feel as if we are a military force in the situation.  I don't think we need to be trying to -- to be a force of any kind.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think we need to let them, um, make a lot of their own decisions. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But there's still a lot of things that -- that are not resolved yet.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and that's where I think our military needs to be there.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] Yeah, I -- I do think it's important to be letting local people take more of a role in terms of being, you know, being involved at this point, now that we're there.  But, you know, really trying to build up and not have us be, you know, an occupying type force.  But instead having the US just serve more as providing resources that are needed, I guess.
R:  Yup.  I -- I agree with that wholeheartedly.  It -- it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it upsets me a little bit that they are already, um, wanting us out of there.  Um, but I think that, [NOISE] um, part of that -- part of the reason may be [NOISE] because they, um, they fear, ah, our intentions and don't really, um, trust.  I -- I think that, um, they've -- they've been told so much how bad we are that they -- they're fearful, um, you know, [MN] to trust us.
L:  Right.
R:  They -- they're afraid to trust us. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I agree with that.  I think -- and I think that's why it's -- it's good to be, you know, making it really obvious that, you know, "We're not here to tell you what to do and to take over your country.  And we're --"
R:  Right.
L:  -- not here just to get your oil or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  "-- the case may be.  But really showing that we're here to do humanitarian things and to get rid of people who are oppressing you and then to let you have your country back".
R:  Right.  And I think it's very, very important at this point that we, ah, um, we do go on and -- and help them get the water back on, the electricity and all of those things, and help them rebuild and for them to realize that that is our purpose there.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, as I think that -- that we really need to, ah, to get that -- that -- those things started for them. [MN]
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  And, ah, and really get things going on -- on that, um, that note.  I think they -- we need to create the trust.
L:  Right, yeah.  [MN] And I think this is a good place where we can start to bring in the UN and some of the other countries to try to rebuild some of those bonds with the rest of the world that -- that had problems over the decision to go to war in the first place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And really, you know, trying to have it be more of a uniting to help them get back on their feet.
R:  Oh, I agree.  I think that, ah, um, I -- I don't think that that's something that [MN] -- I know that we're, you know, one of the major countries in the world as far as advancement and, um, ah, resources.  But, um, there are so many others that are just as advanced as us and are much smaller countries --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that could, ah, could go in and offer a whole lot too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I feel -- I- I'd agree with you.  I think that they -- we need to make this a joint effort.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] So -- so do you think that things will really ever be peaceful in the Middle East at large?
R:  I don't think so.  I don't think that we will -- I don't think that they're a peaceful people.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think they have, um, so much, um [MN] -- th- they've got a very different way of life [LAUGH] and -- and I feel like, um, you know -- I think long before we even went to war I think it was an area that I was afraid to go to, simply from stories, horror stories of personal -- of a personal nature that I had heard.
L:  Mm.
R:  Ah, such as how women are treated and how, um, [MN] um, [MN] they act as if they own, um, you know, a woman or a child.
L:  Right.
R:  Those sort of things.  I think those are things that -- that are going to be very, very difficult for them to overcome and I don't know that they ever will.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] Yeah, I have such mixed feelings about the roles of women in thinking, you know, that we should go in there and nobody should be allowed to, you know, force women to cover their faces and not allow women to drive cars and ...  And then at the same time I think but there are women there who are saying, "Well, really, not being able to drive a car is not a huge deal for me --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I can, you know, do other things".  And that -- so is it my place to say, "Well, you just don't know how bad you have it"?
R:  Right.
L:  Or -- so I find myself between, you know, thinking, [MN] "We have to change this because it's not right" and thinking that --
R:  But yet that's fair.
L:  -- it's not my place --
R:  Right, that's their way of life, right. [MN]
L:  -- to go in and tell them.
R:  Yeah, you're -- you're absolutely right.  You know, how do you go in and make someone else change, and yet those changes are, um, part of what keeps them, um, in a lot of turmoil because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] groups, different groups such as women, ah, um, th- that's the one that o- obviously comes to -- comes to mind the most.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, they -- they see the way the rest of the world reacts and, um, not just reacts but gets to act, um, in their own countries and, um, it creates an unrest for them.  So I feel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, you know, there's -- there's just a lot of issues there that -- that I don't know that they can overcome.
L:  Yeah.  Or it's definitely going to take a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, and I also think that being in countries where the government is based on a religious group and everybody in the country's not from that religious group --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that that's definitely a basis for lots of the unrest.
R:  Agreed.
L:  And that, you know, if you're going to -- going to base your government on your moral beliefs and things like that, then you're definitely going to have people disagreeing with you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah, I've -- just in --
R:  So that'll cau- --
L:  -- hearing --
R:  It'll cause unrest also, right.
L:  Yeah, yeah, just hearing in the past few days how in Iraq they're talking about wanting to set up a new Muslim government --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and where does that leave anybody who's not.
R:  Yeah, but who isn't Muslim, right.
L:  Right.  I mean, and I guess there are some countries like Turkey is a Muslim country but has a sec- secular government --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so that's possible.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I guess it is.  But like you say, ah, you know, I -- they're -- and -- and of course [MN] so many factors go into, um, how a -- a country is, um, um, what their resources are and everything else, you know.  They're such a, um, a desert country --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, um, they've got a lot of -- o- of issues that they have to face every day that we don't know anything about, that we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can't [MN] fathom.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And i- you know, it- it's -- it's very difficult for someone sitting over here to make judgments upon them.
L:  Right.
R:  Just as it would be very difficult for them to sit over there and say, "Well, ah, you know, the United States is such a rich country and yet w- -- you know, we have our own problems right here at home.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, you know, in different areas, in different ways.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whether it be the jobs in different areas, joblessness.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or whether it be, um, a water problem in different areas or whatever it might be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have our -- our own, ah, kind of problems that we have to deal with as -- and we have to deal with them as a people and as a nation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, [MN] we know ourselves [MN] how hard it is to keep that fine line between religion and government. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  Because right here in this country we are fighting our own battle over that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, still.  [MN] Um, and so I feel like, you know, they
