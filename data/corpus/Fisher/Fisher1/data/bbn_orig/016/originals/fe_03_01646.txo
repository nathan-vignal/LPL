R:  Hi, I'm Nerida.
L:  Hi, my name is Vora.  How are you doing?
R:  Okay.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  Um, well, I guess the topic was about peace, am I right?
R:  Yes, peace in the Middle East.
L:  In Middle East, okay.  [MN] This is a hot topic nowadays. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, absolutely. [MN]
L:  [MN] So, um, where are you from, I mean, in terms of location?
R:  I'm -- I live in Philadelphia now.  Um, I'm from New York.  Um --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How about yourself?
L:  [MN] Um, I'm in State College at Central Pennsylvania, next to Penn State University.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] in fact one of my friends from, um, [LIPSMACK] Philadelphia, he -- he talked about this research on the phone and this is why I am participating right now.  Um --
R:  Okay.  So, how do you feel --
L:  Well [MN] --
R:  What -- [MN] first of all, do you have any, um, ethnic ties to the Middle East?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm from Turkey --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- originally and, ah, I'm a student here, international student --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- at Penn State and I'm trying to finish my, um, doc- -- PhD study. [MN]
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  And in fact I was like studying.  I -- I got a little surprised when I got the phone, um --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- this phone call.
R:  Yes, me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Kind of we're about to -- we're about to start finals here so it's a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's a crazy time.  But, um --
L:  Yeah, I can imagine.
R:  So --
L:  [MN] Yes.
R:  So -- so being originally from Turkey, does it -- does it -- do you follow it more closely what's going on in the Middle East?
L:  Yeah, in fact, I mean, especially, um, [MN] the Iraq situation. [MN]
R:  Mm.
L:  I was, like, always, um, reading the news from Turkey and comparing how different they are from the USA.  And, um, yeah, I mean, [MN] of course I- I don't have like particular, ah, ideology in terms of USA or Iraq or any other, ah, countries.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] in general I think everything is a complete play, ah, on the media --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's somehow being, um, directed by the politics around the world.  Like, even in Turkey, I guess.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, not only in USA.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But even in Turk- -- ah, in -- even in Turkey I guess it's more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, kind of a play.  I don't know.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is my view in general so I don't have really particularly like, "Oh, we should do this in order to that and this will be better and this will turn to be a peace or something like that".
R:  Mhm.
L:  What about you? [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, well, [MN] I'm -- I have some relatives in Israel so it's --
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, I see.
R:  It's a very -- you know, it's a very precarious situation.  And --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- actually, um, I have wanted to go to Israel for some time but ever since I've been old enough that I would --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- make the decision to travel there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just -- it's been so, um -- such a frightening place --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to go that I haven't had the chance to go and visit relatives.  And it's -- it's very distressing in a way because, you know, when they talk about -- when they talk about peace it just doesn't seem like anybody truly wants peace, that they just want --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They just want --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to destroy each other and annihilate each other.  And, um, I mean, I have a -- a very dear friend who's in the -- the army in Israel and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she says that, um, that the goal is t- to -- is not to negotiate anything at this point, not to settle anything, not to, you know, give up land or make some kind of arrangement.  But rather to -- simply for every, um, every person killed in Israel to retaliate and kill another person, another Palestinian.  And it's -- it's this mentality of, you know, back and forth that it --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- just -- it's just very scary.  And the more I read about it, it -- it just -- today's -- today's news about the Middle East is reminiscent of last year's news, which is reminiscent of the year bef- -- I mean, it just seems like nothing is ever really changing.
L:  Yeah, you are right, you are right.  Um, I do understand that.  I mean, in Turkey we are a little bit far away, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- from the war, even though we are close to these countries.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, a- -- but I can understand you.  I'm, ah -- I'm -- I'm in the -- in the place of -- we're a little bit like I'm looking to all that you want --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from the theoretical perspective, rather than like a- -- the real situation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, like for instance in your case, if you want to travel to Israel and, um -- like, this affects you, I mean, directly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Rather than my situation here.  So, I mean, I can understand your concern really.  Um --
R:  Now, Tur- Turkey has played a role in -- in -- in what's going on with Iraq now, right?  In terms of, um --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- being a base for inte- -- they've been very, um -- they've been allies with the United States in offering them, ah --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- space an- and help like that, right?
L:  Yes, yes.  They were, um -- first they said -- I -- I guess -- I mean, they were into, +especially the government, our new government, they were into opening the bases on Northern Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But later on somehow they couldn't pass the, um, what -- what is called?  I don't know.  But, I mean, the +Senate, i- -- they do not pa- -- ah, let the American troops to use the Turkish, ah, land --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on Northern Iraq.  And this was kind of like an u- unexpected result.  And the government was so upset.  But on the other hand, um, the majority of the people living in Turkey, like at that point, they were against any kind of war, um, toward any country.  So somehow it represented the, ah, the voices of people living in the country --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- by like rejecting, um, I mean, the US troops to use the lands of Turkey in the war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, somehow that government was trying to argue with the, ah, people and they couldn't manage it.  But, ah, of course, I mean, later on they said, "Oh, we are in the coalition too" and, um, Turkey let the USA -- airbases, to use the -- the airspace.
R:  There must be just so much pressure on these countries from -- because of France and Germany being, you know, so polarized from --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- the United States efforts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There just --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- there just much be so much pressure within Europe itself.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, the pressure is always there though in any way.  Ah, [LAUGH] I mean -- and I guess in terms of, like, France and Germany, I guess they were -- they like [MN] aga- -- they were kind of against the war because they recognized that they were not going to gain anything.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, they thought they will be excluded from what is going on.  And of course from their perspective it was kind of weird, what they thought.  And I guess this is why they forced, um -- like, they forced this perspective being against the war.
R:  How do you --
L:  Because they changed their minds right now, as I know.
R:  Yeah.  How do you --
L:  It is kind of weird. [LAUGH]
R:  How do -- how do you personally feel about the war?  I'm always curious to hear how other people feel about it?
L:  Well, in fact we were all against Saddam in any kind of regime like that, that is going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So in some manner, ah, right now I feel a little bit comfortable with the situation because the war is ended.  And somehow I guess -- I mean, I'm hoping that the people are not dying after all and, um -- [MN] well, this is kind of a like a good, um, improvement.  But on the other hand, I mean, I -- I -- it's kind of obvious that, um, even though USA pretends that they want the peace for everyone, I think basically everything is, um, related to money and, ah, the oil in Middle East.
R:  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
L:  I mean, even like [MN] -- I don't know, this is kind of really too obvious.
R:  Yeah.  No, it's -- it's -- it's funny that you say that because it -- it seems like there's always economic self interest involved wherever we, you know, we go to, ah, to s- start something so to speak.  But it just -- I mean, I -- personally I've reversed myself.  I was very opposed to the idea of going to war because I thought it would be so divisive among so many --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- countries that it would begin just a sea of retaliation against the United States for getting involved where, um -- you know, basically just to protect their own economic interests and not understanding the way of life in other countries and trying to impose American values upon countries that maybe were not, um, amenable to it.  [MN] However now seeing just the -- the CNN reports on how -- how the pe- -- so many of the people in Iraq, now I don't know if it's -- if it's, you know, bias, like you were saying with the media, to present it to Americans in a certain way, because I wouldn't put it past the media, but it does seem like there is a significant amount of the population is glad that -- that this is happening, that their government is -- you know, that Saddam is coming -- you know, is -- is out of power.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I mean, it's -- it just -- it -- it's amazing to me that we haven't seen more of a fight from -- and, I mean, the whole suggestion that we killed Saddam, it -- it seems kind of -- it seems viable in a way because we haven't seen any kind of hostile retaliation against us.  I mean, thank God, but I was expecting more of a, ah, of some type of fight.
L:  Mhm.  Yes, yes.  I agree to that.
R:  And -- and, I mean -- I- I'm not a -- I don't know if you're a big George W fan or not.  I'm not particularly and I -- I thought that he was trying to use the opportunity to go to war like, you know, to get the approval ratings like his father got after the Persian Gulf War.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  How do you feel about President Bush?
L:  President Bush?  Um
