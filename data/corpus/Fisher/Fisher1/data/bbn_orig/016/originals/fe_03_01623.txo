L:  Hi, I'm Beverley Schwartz. 
R:  Hi, this is Jay Pulley[?] 
L:  Hi, Jay.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  All right.  Well, at least we got a good topic today.
R:  [LAUGH] Why, what was it before?
L:  Ah, ah, strikes in professional sports.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, hey, where are you located? 
L:  I'm in Boston, Mass and you? 
R:  Okay, so I'm in Washington, so let's see, I'm trying to figure out if the marathon is over.  I've got a two oh eight pm --
L:  I have no idea.
R:  No, okay.
L:  I'm not a big marathon fan.
R:  Oh, all right.
L:  So the Middle East.  Now, I don't know whether they're thinking Iraq or Israel or what, um, but I have opinions on all of it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So let's see, how does this work?  Um, they're going to record -- 
L:  They're recording us right now.
R:  Um.
L:  And we talk for ten minutes on these selected -- on the topic of the day.
R:  Okay, you want to start?
L:  Sure, um, ... 
R:  Shoot.
L:  So, do you want to talk about Iraq or -- or Israel?
R:  Let's do Iraq.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's probably less controversial. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's for sure.  Well, um, ah, my feeling on Iraq is I feel that the, ah, I'm very cynical about our current administration.  Um, I think that they've done a big Bayton[?] switch on us.  I was almost at the point of supporting the war when they were talking about weapons of mass destruction but, you know, then they go in and, you know, they start talking about, ah, getting -- getting rid of the, you know, Hussein, ah, reign of power and it's like, "Wait a second, we just had a Bayton switch here, what happened to weapons of mass destruction?" 
R:  Yeah, I -- I hear you.  I don't feel so bad about that though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it's almost to me a case of they probably know more than what they're saying.  Um, if there's any cynicism upon me, it might be a little bit towards Mr Chaney.  I think, at least down here in Washington, he's probably the least credible out of the gang of -- who's running things, but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I think, um, you know, I think they're sending a message over there and I think so far it's gone a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to go in the first week.
L:  That I have to agree.  Um, it -- it definitely has gone, um, much faster.
R:  You know, I was looking at this thing as -- as, you know, it's easy to win a war, it's very hard to win a clash of cultures unless you just wipe somebody out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  --  and we certainly weren't going to do that, and I thought it was going to be a complete cl- clash of cultures in the beginning but it doesn't seem to have gone to that and, um, [LIPSMACK] maybe it won't.  I mean, it's still a little early to tell, but who knows where any of the leadership is and where they've gone and so, we'll just have to see.
L:  Well, it's still very early.  I mean, we're s- -- we're talking about a culture that's got probably seven different, um, ethnicities at least, each with their own values and their own agendas.
R:  Yeah, but, I mean, in general, my kind of -- US centric view is that it's almost like everybody is sort of five hundred years in the past with a very possible minority of -- who -- who aren't and, um, ah, that makes things very difficult.  You know, people are living in -- with value systems and beliefs that the US hasn't held to if not ever, at least for a couple -- a couple of hundred years.
L:  Um, well, one -- I -- I agree with you, it is a very US centric view.  Um, you know, an interesting thing for me is when the war started, I was, ah, travelling from Vietnam to Cambodia so it was very interesting being in a country which was completely devastated by, ah, American forces, um, while listening to all this discussion about going to Iraq and, um, you know, it's -- the thing is is our way is not necessarily the right way.  And I think that it is arrogant to say -- this whole attitude of making the world safe for democracy which was the attitude they had in the Vietnam era, um, it's -- it's crazy.  Um, you know, in Vietnam now there's a lot of changes.  It's -- it's a very positive up beat place right now and they're not, um, rallying for democracy at this point.
R:  Well, I -- I haven't been there, I've been to the Middle East but, ah, my understanding of what's going on in South East Asia is that it's going more towards economic democracy.
L:  Yes.
R:  So in that sense, maybe it is becoming more like the US. I don't know if -- I don't know if that's benefiting everybody or just a small minority of people or what.
L:  It's benefiting some.  Um, it hasn't really worked its way into the -- the, ah, hinterlands yet, um, although I think everybody in general is better off than they were twenty years ago.  Um, but the thing that I lear- I did a lot of reading on Vietnam before I went, and the -- the thing that I learned from that experience is that, you know, the attitude of the United States is, "Oh, they're so backward and, you know, we're, you know, how can we possibly lose to them" and we had not a clue as to what their value systems were and, um, that they themselves were split about the direction that they wanted to go in.  And, you know, I hope that our administration is a little more sophisticated this time around in understanding, ah, these different folks and, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, what they're wanting out of their government.  It's not going to work if we go in and say, "Okay, here's democracy modeled as it is in the United States, um, go ahead, let's -- let's put in this place and this is what you guys are going to live by", it's not going to work.
R:  Yeah, maybe.  Um, I think probably the administration is certainly more savvy and -- and understanding of the world than it was thirty years ago when, ah, we went into Vietnam but, um, [LIPSMACK] um, like I say, I think hopefully everything will turn out.  Um, will it have an effect on the rest of the Middle East?  It might.  I mean, it looks like maybe Syria is starting to come over to our side and not be confrontational right now.  Um, maybe they're willing to work with us, ah, maybe this will, um, maybe it may disrupt some of the nontheologically, um, centered governments in the Middle East and maybe that will be a good thing.  We'll see.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, well -- I -- I guess there's two parts.  Will -- will the -- the area overall, um, improve?  Probably.  There will probably be more stability that comes out of this because the United States is going to enforce stability and certainly the economic life in the United States is going to improve because we're going to have control of the oilfields in Iraq, at least for a short while.  Um, the question to me is whether the ends justified the means.  Um, should we have gone into this in the first place?  I'm not sure.  You know, it's -- the only thing that -- that, um, [LIPSMACK] would swing me at all was one of self protection which is there may be these weapons of mass destruction and th- we need to go in to deal with this.  But beyond that, it's as -- as evil as Saddam Hussein is, as soon as we walk in and say, "This is a bad government, we're going to do something about it, ah, we're going to impose something else on you", we're walking into trouble.
R:  Yeah.  Um, maybe if, ah, the, ah, regime is kicked out as it apparently is and then we let everybody else take over, maybe they will sort of revert to a better system, not necessarily ours or anybody else's, ah.  You know, you could always argue that, ah, all of their dissent has been, ah, squashed over the past eight years, um, and maybe they will [NOISE] form their own system that will benefit their people.  I don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They certainly have the resources to do it and to make life a hell of a lot better for all of their [NOISE] -- all of their people.  I mean -- they have the -- the, you know, they certainly have the oil, they're what, the third largest, ah -- 
L:  Second.
R:  Second.
L:  Yeah, even better.  They're potentially the second largest oil producer.
R:  Yeah, so, you know, if the US is smart and can get those fields producing without UN sanctions and get the money back in there quickly to refinance the rebuilding and to make it better for all of the citizens and, um, maybe it will come out okay, you know.  I think one of the best things they could do would be the same thing that Douglas McArthur did in, ah, in occupied Japan.  [NOISE] One -- one of the first things he did was give women the right to vote in Japan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if they do that, most of the time women vote for things that they feel will improve their family and make the future better for their kids.
