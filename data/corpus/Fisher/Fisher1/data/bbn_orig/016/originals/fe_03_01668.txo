R:  Hi, are you there? [NOISE]
L:  Yes, hi.
R:  Hi. [NOISE]
L:  Um, I guess we're just supposed to talk about the Middle East?
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  My favorite topic.  No, it's not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, um, well, what do you think about it, about the war and everything?  
R:  Um, I think --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Well, I was just listening the radio not too long ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, earlier this afternoon.  And they said something like -- oh, i- it was one of the Iraqi citizens and he said that it's better than it could be with, um, Saddam.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's not -- it's not good now.
L:  Right, but I think it's definitely improving with --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, we didn't know going into it, we couldn't predict the future.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that's why the UN was hesitant to get into it.
L:  Mhm.  Um, but I think that the majority of the Iraqi citizens are very supportive of us being over there.  Um --
R:  Yeah, they were talking about a demonstration that happened today and it was like two thousand people or something in --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- the Muslim state, I think they said.  I'm not really [LAUGH] -- my husband knows a lot more about this than I do but anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, and that before Saddam would require [NOISE] -- I don't know, he would just get millions of people to -- to demonstrate in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in his favor, of course.
L:  Right.
R:  So this the US was really excited about 'cause it s- showed, "Hey, look, freedom of speech".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that's good.
L:  Yeah.  Um, [MN] I saw -- I was reading, um, on the internet earlier today and I think they're -- they've caught several, um, people on their most wanted list.  I think they caught Saddam's brother in law --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- maybe.  Um, I'm not really sure.  [MN] I don't know, um ...
R:  I heard about the trading card, that they had playing cards and then on the back were different faces of the different people that they were showing around to try and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and see if the Iraqis could help us find them.
L:  Did you, um -- a couple of days ago did you hear they found all that money, um, in these --
R:  No.
L:  -- hidden -- they found something like millions of dollars, um, in US money, hidden in these --
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  -- um, houses, like, kinda out just in the woods somewhere.
R:  Huh.
L:  I think that the, um, some of the Baath -- the people of the Baath party, Saddam's party, had, um, abandoned the houses.  And they were just these little cottages and, um, some of the troops found it and they went in and there was just all these boxes of just hundreds of thousands of dollars.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, I -- I don't know exactly what [MN] -- I'm not sure if they ever figured out exactly what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the deal with it was but, um.
R:  Well, and that just reminds me, you know, while we were bombing Iraq I would hear reports of, you know, different members spotted fleeing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Iraqi money.  And I just thought, "Wh- wh- what good is that gonna be?" [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  I mean, I suppose they use the same currency.  I don't know if they use it in other places or not.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't know.  Um, [MN] but I think that it sounds like it's kinda --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- winding down a lot faster than I thought it --
R:  Yeah, I'm glad too.
L:  -- was.  I mean, I'm definitely happy about that.  But I thought it was going to be something that would last longer.  I mean, obviously --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- the conflicts aren't over but I thought that the actual combat would last longer than it sounds like it's going to.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Um, I did so that, um, that Saddam is -- they are almost positive he's still alive.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I saw that today.  Um, I'm not sure how they knew that or what, um -- where they got that from.  But [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think they're pretty sure that he's still alive somewhere.
R:  Well, I enjoy late night comics and I probably hear more about Iraq from there than any --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, they were comparing Saddam to, um, bin Laden.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And just, you know, bin Laden hides out in caves, he's used to that.
L:  Right.
R:  Whereas here's Saddam and he's lost his palace. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  How long can he last?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So hopefully not long.
L:  Yeah.  I don't -- I think that -- I don't know.  You hea- I've heard so much about all these, um, like, imposter Saddams.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Guys that look just like him --
R:  Doubles, yeah.
L:  -- you know, that they've got running around.  So I don't know if they'll ever really know if they --
R:  True.
L:  -- catch him.  I mean, I'm -- I'm sure they'll --
R:  It's not like they have DNA or anything.  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Um, so I don't -- I don't know.  But I hope they catch him and --
R: Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.
R:  Let's see, what else did I hear?
L:  Um.  [MN] [LAUGH] Gosh.  Um --
R:  Oh, about the museums being looted and --
L:  [MN] Oh, I didn't hear about any of that.
R:  I mean, I believe that it's Iraqi citizens that are going in and doing it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And yet they're blaming the US.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yes, we took out who was in power so that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the museums were not guarded but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN] I don't know.  And they even were saying that the US was, like, in the, what did they call it?  They were like on the grounds of the museum fighting resistance --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- when this happened.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, I mean, they weren't -- [LIPSMACK] they weren't positioned to protect.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, they were still trying to win it over.
L:  Hm.
R:  Crazy.
L:  Yeah.  Gosh.
R:  But, I mean, it's a shame.  It's horrible when, you know, cultural things like that are -- are lost.
L:  Yeah [inaudible].
R:  But freedom is far more important and -- and getting someone as evil as Saddam out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that people can be protected, I think is far more important.
L:  Yes, me too.  Um --
R:  Well, we're about half way there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Has it been five minutes?  I haven't been looking at the clock.  Um, this is random but it's about the war.  [LAUGH] Um, a friend of mine was telling me a story that he read in the newspaper or something.  This is several weeks ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, he said that there was some US troops who they -- I think they were -- it was when they were trying to get to Baghdad, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they had to go through this other town or something on the way.  And, um, when they went through this town there was -- all the citizens, like, kind of started to, um, protest against them 'cause they thought they were there to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hurt them.  But they really weren't, they were just passing through.  [LAUGH] Um, and so one of the commanders or General, I don't know, one of the leaders of the troops that were there told all his men -- like, the, um, protestors or the citizens were kind of in a big group and they were, like, advancing at the troops.  Um, so the, um, General told all the men to take a knee, so they all got down and, like, the citizens kind of stopped.  And then, um, he told them to put their guns down and smile and so all the US guys were, like, sitting on the ground smiling and then they realized that they weren't there to hurt 'em and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they started smiling back and they were just like, "Okay, it's all okay".  I thought that was a neat story.
R:  Ah, yeah, that's pretty weird.
L:  Um --
R:  That instead of saying, you know, "Oh, they're just taking up arms against us let's shoot them".
L:  Right.  'Cause, I mean, they -- they couldn't communicate so I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thought it was just neat that by doing that they were able to let them know that, "Hey, we're not here to hurt you, we're trying to help you".  [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Back when that was all happening, you know, before they had captured Baghdad of course.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I had heard on the news too just how the citizens were being threatened.  That --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know who, but they were going to the homes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- saying, you know, "Your sons are going to come and fight and if you don't we're gonna shoot you and ..."  I mean, I just thought, "How horrible, how scary".
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  And [MN] the other sickening part was when the POWs were taken.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, that just made me sick.  I mean, I know that's all part of war but ...
L:  But still it's ...
R:  I don't -- yeah, that I couldn't handle. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-uh.  No, that was horrible.
R:  I mean, I know a lot of lives were lost but --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- it's hard.
L:  That just kind of makes it even more [inaudible].
R:  [LIPSMACK] 'Cause, like, I guess because now I know people that are, you know, serving in the reserves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or called up to active duty [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are over there and, yeah, it's a little closer to home.  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely, definitely.  [NOISE] Um --
R:  We didn't really introduce ourselves.
L:  [MN] 
R:  You must be from the East Coast?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Am I right?  Are you fr- --
L:  Yes.
R:  Like, Boston?
L:  Um, actually North Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What about you?
R:  I'm from Idaho.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm, um -- I'm in school in North Carolina.
R:  Oh.
L:  At Chapel Hill.  Um, but I -- I live in Charlotte so ... [MN]
R:  What's your major?
L:  Ah, biology.
R:  Oh, what do -- what do you think you'll do?
L:  Um, I'm interested in genetic counseling.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, who knows if that's und- what I'll end up doing but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it really interests me, um.
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  So ...
R:  I am a newly stay at home mom.
L:  Oh.
R:  She's four weeks old.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  And I have a two year old so I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I know about -- I'd --
L:  You've got the mom thing down?
R:  I'd made the decision -- well, 'cause she is so much easier than my --
L:  Really?
R:  -- two year old [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was and is.  He's horrible.
L:  Oh.
R:  But he's taking a nap at the moment --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's great, congratulations. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, thank you.
L:  Mm.  [NOISE] Yeah.  Let's see, I'm trying to think what else.  Do you know how much longer?  [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  It's hard to ta- -- I don't -- I'm not that informed about the -- I mean, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I kinda know the basic what's going on over there but I don't -- I- I wish I were a little more educated --
R:  You know --
L:  -- on it so I could ...
R:  September eleventh I watched the news for three straight days --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I was like in a fog.  And finally I was like, "You know what?  I have got to get on". [MN] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I stopped watching the news and I really haven't gone back to it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, when they started the bombing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then I was watching more.  But [MN] like I said, it made me sick. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, no, I don't follow the news as closely.
L:  Yeah.  I just try to, um, you know, like the main headlines on the internet.
R:  Right.
L:  I look at those ev
