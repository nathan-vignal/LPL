L:  [PAUSE] [NOISE] Shh, I'm on the phone. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  Did they ever hook us up?
L:  Yeah.  I'm here.
R:  Okay.  Hi, how are you?
L:  Pretty good.  How are you doing?
R:  Oh, pretty good.  So we're supposed to talk about the Middle East. 
L:  I guess. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  What do you think abou- -- 
L:  My name is -- my name is Shannon. 
R:  I'm Hope.
L:  I didn't hear no tone, so that's what I was waiting for, but -- 
R:  I didn't, either.  I didn't hear anything ever start recording, so -- so what do you think?  Are we ever going to get done with this war?
L:  Well, I -- I don't think so.  I think we're going to stay over there a long time to straighten it out, to rebuild it and I have -- I actually have a nephew over there that, um, they said they're going to be over there a whole 'nother year, so -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, at least until the end of the year and into the following year, so I think it's going to be a very long process.
R:  Well, I have several friends that over there have husbands that are over there, so it is this really bad thing, a lot of people missing a lot of family.
L:  Yeah, they really are.  I mean I -- [MN] I guess I can see why we went over there, but sometimes it's kind of confusing and then it's confusing for kids.  I have a sixteen year old that's really, um, was uptight over the whole thing because, you know, they started writing all those warnings and she was afraid we were going to get bombed and, you know, it was, like, -- it was hard to explain, you know -- 
R:  Yeah, it really is.  They did -- 
L:  -- becau- --
R:  -- all the procedures at school here, too.
L:  Well, see, they didn't do nothing at our school, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you just heard it on CNN and they blasted CNN in every class, you know, but they didn't prepare them for it, you know, and so they thought we were probably, you know -- they were, you know, they really didn't know what to expect, so, I mean you hate to tell them no, nothing like that can happen, because it could, you know --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you don't want to misguide your kids, but she was a little confused, so ... I don't know.  But did you hear that -- I asked my sister about this yesterday.  Um, did you hear about that, when they posted or hung the United States flag over, uh, Saddam when they pulled him over -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it was hung upside down?  Did you hear that? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I haven't heard nothing more about it.  
R:  No, they --  
L:  I mean he was on Larry King, that kid was, and he was ordered to do that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he was never reprimanded for it because it's, like, his captain told him to do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Bu- but, you know, I wonder.  I mean, that means they are in dire need, they're in need of help, send more help.  What is that all about?  Have you heard any more or ...  
R:  No, I haven't heard anything.  The only thing I've seen on that is them pulling it down.  That's all they showed here.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That was -- that was about all I got out of it.
L:  Yeah, 'cause they put -- he put it up and he took a lot of time putting it up and put it upside down, stars side down, and then took it down, left it there for a few seconds, took it down and then put up, I guess, like, the new Iraqi flag or something -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or the old one, because there was a new one made when, I don't know, Saddam came in or something, so he put that one back up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, th- the older one, so I wondered about that because that was just really weird.
R:  Yeah, it was.  It was really strange.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought the same thing.  Yeah, and --
L:  I just wondered if they felt, like, they were in danger, you know, so maybe they thought there was bigger cells there than there really was, you know, of those militants and stuff, but it sounds like they got everything under control.  I mean it's, like, the war is over now and now on -- on CNN it's -- it's called, like, rebuilding in -- rebuilding, what is it now, they're saying rebuilding Iraq or something like that, but nothing, hardly anything with the war now, it's all about rebuilding and so ... I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And --  and I tell you, have you sign the POW thing that was on the other night from Texas?
L:  Oh, where they -- [inaudible] got to come home?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that was really touching, I tell you what.
R:  Tha- -- yeah, that was really nice.  I thought that was real sweet.
L:  Yeah, it was and now, um, it was -- it was kind of, um, -- I -- I didn't realize it, but I got thinking about it after I'd seen it, you know, heard about this, but I went to school for psychology and I never gave it any thought but, you know, they said when them POWs are together, like, that for a long time they get so trusting of each other they don't want to separate -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, there was a problem when they were in the hospital, you know, they didn't want to be separated, they wanted to be with one another and it -- I would see it being hard to separate because you're thinking you're going to die and they're the last people, you know, faces that you can trust with you and so I was, like, "Wow", you know, I never gave that a thought that they would bond so strongly, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I bet that was hard for them to go home and leave them because they kept one another safe and kept one another going and then going home to your family would be tough.
R:  Yeah, it would be tough.  It'd be -- it'd be a mental strain.  The -- 
L:  Yeah, it really would.
R:  -- just like the girl, Jessica, that got all that stuff done to her, can you imagine having to come back over here and trying to deal with all this?
L:  Oh, my goodness, no.  No.
R:  And they're just -- they're just over bundling her with stuff, you know, people are writing, I'm sure, and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and all kinds of stuff coming in the mail, you know.  She's getting just a bunch of stuff and I mean she deserves it.
L:  Yeah.  W- -- that's where, um, you know, they've been discussing this bit and I listen to Coast to Coast and they got it on there quite a little bit, the AM radio, you know, they've been talking about having -- even that's the problem, they say, about putting women on the front line, because the men get really protective of the women because they know the dangers of being in these kind of countries, like, you know, w- where we're at right now.  It's because they're savages, you know, Saddam's boys himself -- themselves were, you know, horrible guys.  I mean they kill and rape and everything and that's the problem they're getting into now, is actually putting these women in harm's way like this because, um, so much more can happen to them psychologically --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think, than guys, you know, is what they're saying.  I don't know.  I know I wouldn't be the same, ever the same.  Uh, I mean, er, you know, when you get your dignity taken from you like she did, I'm sure, you know. 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, it wasn't just being beat on and stuff.  I'm -- I'm sure they went, you know, further than that and that's where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they get this deal where they're afraid of putting women up there any more because of this problem, so -- but, I don't know.  It's --
R:  It ain't easy being a mama.  I couldn't see them do the children and the women and stuff, like they're doing over there. 
L:  Oh.
R:  You know -- you know, just pulling the kids out in front of them to -- to keep from having to get shot themselves and -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I just -- I don't think the -- I don't think the mental strain on me would be enough for them to pay me a billion dollars to deal with it.
L:  No.  No.  I don't think so.
R:  I couldn't handle the children thing and it -- [NOISE] it -- it would just kill me.
L:  Yeah, it would.
R:  It wou- -- I couldn't handle seeing a little baby shot or even an older child.
L:  No, no, a- anybody 'cause I've always been a reactor, so, um, [NOISE] uh, y- -- that's the deal [NOISE] and I -- I would probably get killed myself before, you know what I mean? 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  'Cause it would just be horrible because I've heard that, where they -- they'll actually kill the kid in front of them and then kill the parent, you know.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And then I heard they run them through wood choppers or something like that -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some of these people and then did you see where they actually found all those, um, coffins and stuff -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in that one, uh, what is -- what was it?  Like a warehouse or something? 
R:  Mhm.
L:  They were lined, like, five high, all the way across.  I was, like, "Boy, you'd think they could at least bury the poor souls", you know.
R:  It's almost like Hitler.
L:  Yeah, like they were keeping them for trophies or something.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's so sickening to think that, uh, you know, at least we haven't had to bring it over here, we're just really lucky.
L:  Yeah, exactly. 
R:  I think that Americans haven't had to deal with that on their own soil.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're just -- we've been really lucky all these years.  God knows that it might not keep happening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But hopefully we will be able to keep them over there.
L:  Well, that's the deal I- I've mixed feelings about is, um, these people -- I can understand why people didn't want us to invade, but, on the other hand, I understand why we did it.  First of all, it's inhumane to allow people -- that's how I feel, this is how I feel, I guess I should say -- inhumane to allow people to continue to be treated like that, just -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on that basis alone, not including the fact that we were in danger because of the possible chemical weapons and everything, you know, that was going on and the links to al Qaeda but, you know, that alone, but then you have these people who are, like, wasting their time picketing and parading against this war, even after it was going on, still doing this -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I was like, "What is going on here?  There is nothing you can do now, it's started, it's done, it's a done deal, it's just wa- -- quit wasting your energy doing this, let's support these people", you know.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Now they wonder -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how they figure out how they got the freedom --
