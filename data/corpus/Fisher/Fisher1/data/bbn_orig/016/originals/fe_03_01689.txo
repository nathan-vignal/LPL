L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello. [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Dan.
L:  Yes, Dan.  [NOISE] This is, um, Shannon in Minnesota.
R:  Hi -- hi, I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Here, you wanna talk to him.
R:  So what do you think about the Middle East?
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello? 
L:  Hello, this is Jim Quarst[?]. [NOISE]
R:  Yes, this is Dan Horowitz from Philadelphia.
L:  Yes.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  How many people am I talking to?
L:  Just one.
R:  Jim, you said your name is?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  So what do you think about the Middle East, Jim?
L:  Well, I think it's a problem that's gonna be drawn out for many years and many years, and I'm not sure it's gonna be solved a hundred percent fashion.
R:  Right, I, I tend to agree with that.  I think that, ah, right now we're not in a good situation to solve things.  I think that nothing's gonna get done as long as, um, Sharon's in power in Israel and as long as Bush is in power here.
L:  I got a similar feeling about it, very -- nearly identical.
R:  Right.  I mean, yeah, I, I was, um, [LIPSMACK] in Israel, I guess, about nineteen ninety four ninety five, um, everything was looking good over there, you know, I mean, ah, Sharon -- I mean, Rabin had been assassinated, but, ah, yeah, it was during the Clinton administration and they were, they were talking peace at least, and ah, they didn't have all the suicide bombers and everything going on, on there, and of course it was before nine eleven, and um, there was a much more peaceful time, I think, that, ah, yeah, I think if Clinton had had some more time, and, and the Israelis had stuck with Barak I think, um, we might have gotten somewhere. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I believe it would have been a better situation than we're facing now, for sure.  It's, like, a lot of these countries are taking advantage of the US too, where they wanna get as much out of us as they possibly can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, and you know, give us little in return if we need anything that would really help us, financially or whatever way, they're not there to help us in return.
R:  Right.  [NOISE] Yeah, I, I don't know what's gonna happen there, um, yeah, it's never been a stable situation, I just -- I think it's unfortunately gotten more unstable the past couple of years, um, I don't know what, um, the whole Iraqi situation is going to add to the mix.  I mean, I guess it's better that we're in charge for now than, ah, Saddam Hussein, but, um, I think that can cause more, um, resentment and terrorist attacks over here, and ah, [LIPSMACK] you know, and who knows what else over there.  Ah, ... so, I don't know.  And, and, you know, if Bush is as crazy as he is, and, you know, he was talking about going into Syria, I think that's a mistake.
L:  That's right.  You know, it's all -- if he decides to go into Syria, where does that end and what other country's gonna be causing uprisings that, that we will have to think, or Bush will think that we need to control and he'll keep going into one country after another without end, is what I'm afraid of.
R:  Right.  And I -- and, um, part of the reason why [LAUGH] the Palestinians hate the Israelis, is because they think they're in their land, well, you know, what are we doing over there?
L:  Right.  Yeah, I guess that's -- that kinda would really sum it up too.  Why we're kinda intruding in their form of government, I mean, there's a lot of people -- of Iraqi people that don't -- didn't like Saddam, but then he had a lot of supporters too again that would fight for him 'til the dying end.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- it's just -- to me it's a no win situation.
R:  Right.  I mean, I'm -- I'm a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, and ah, Michael Moore was here speaking on campus last week, and one of the things he pointed out was that, you know, here, [LIPSMACK] when we got out independence back in the revolutionary war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we did that ourselves.  You know, I mean, it wouldn't have been the same, he said, if, you know, for example, Spain, who hated the British, came in and said, "Okay, well, you know, we don't like the British so we're gonna take them out and then give you a country to -- to run, you know, to have for yourself".  I mean, we got our independence ourself, you know, it wasn't handed to us by, by someone else, and I don't know, the, ah, -- I mean, I'm sure the Iraqi people are better off under this system than under Saddam Hussein, but, ah, you know, giving them, um, -- throwing out their dictator to bring in democracy, I don't think it's gonna work.  Democracy has to come in, you know, from the grass roots up, you know, start at the ground level and, ah, and rise up from the people.  It can't be, ah, forced upon people, especially when they don't know what to do with it.
L:  Right.  Right, that's exactly what my thinking is too, it's not something that they've really been asking for, then they don't know how our system operates -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's gonna take a lot of time to indoctrinate them that they do realise what we're trying to do there, and how we're trying to help them.
R:  Mm.  But then again, I don't know how compatible the, the form of Islam they practice, I mean, a lot of the people there practices, with democracy, you know, when, when you have rules about, um, a woman's place in society and, and how she has to have her head covered, and, and the place of religion in society, I mean, it's, it's a different ball game.
L:  Right.  Entirely different than anything we're accustomed to.
R:  Right.  So, you know, I don't -- I don't know what's gonna -- what's gonna happen over there.  Ah, it's complicated, it, it'll -- it'll stay that way for a long time I guess, I don't, I don't see, see an end, but I, I do know that, ah, if any, any progress is gonna be made, ah, some regimes have to change over here and, and over in Israel, you know.
L:  Right.  Yeah, and this -- so this doesn't leave an opening for, ah, bin Laden to come in here and do all kind of terroristic acts maybe that he's been just waiting just for the right day and the right situation to pull off that we will be having our guard completely left down again because of all our soldiers, many of our soldiers --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- are in the far east right now, and --
R:  And the thing --
L:  -- not here to help.
R:  -- about that is, is not, not that -- not like we should be listening to bin Laden or anything, but I mean, his whole point was that, ah, you know, Americans are taking over the world, they're taking over the Middle East, they're -- you know, they have their nose in, in a bunch of other stuff, and so what do we go do in response, we stick our nose in more stuff.
L:  Right.  Yeah, that's -- that's gonna be -- lead to some far fetching troubles, is my thinking right now of it.
R:  Right.
L:  It'll be something that they'll wanna come back on us, and on to everything that we're trying to do.
R:  Right.  I guess part, part of my frustration, I think, is that, ah, yeah, the country is asleep to some degree, you know, they're letting Bush say what he wants to say, do what he wants to do, and, ah, you know, there, there's no end in sight.  I mean, he still has a very high approval rating, and, ah, you know, it seems like the Democrats are just folding their tents and they're gonna kinda let two thousand and four go by, you know, hope -- I mean, I don't hope there's gonna be another, another terrorist attack, but I mean, if it does, I hope the timing of it is right, it opens up enough people's eyes to, ah, make them think that we need a new direction in this country.
L:  Right.  But ah, I think, you know, a lot of this is really -- it seems to be a personal battle of Bush's because his father was kinda all --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- done when what we -- what his -- his regime was trying to do, and now it's taking --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I, I agree.  I --
L:  -- Junior Bush is trying to, ah, make up for what his father failed in, and --
R:  Don't get me wrong, because Saddam Hussein's not a good guy, and, you know, I don't mind seeing, ah, -- you know, his government taken by force, but there's really no logical explanation as to why now is the time or the place, he just kind of -- you know, it's cowboy George trying to avenge, ah, you know, his father's [LAUGH] presidency, basically. 
L:  Right.  [MN]
R:  But yeah, I mean, I, I still don't understand the answer to the question, why Iraq, why now, you know.  I mean, under -- Afghanistan I can kind of understand, although, I mean, though the problem with terrorism is that it's not run by government, it's run by, you know, groups of terrorist cells.  You know, we don't -- we don't bomb the United States because you have Timothy McVeigh blowing up the Oklahoma City federal building where he's an American -- 
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- but the United States government's not responsible for his actions. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, if you're gonna go by the theory, government should be bombing Saudi Arabia at this moment, 'cause, ah, a lot of the hijackers came from there.  So, it's an interesting kind of war to fight.  But, ah, I don't think we're making any headway by going into, um, you know, um, ah, Iraq or -- and -- and certainly not Syria.
L:  And then what -- if we happen to go into Syria, then what might happen to, ah, North Korea?  I mean, are they gonna be next in line then, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you're gonna feel, like, -- you're feeling, like, we're gonna be intruding in their territory eventually and wanna take action against us, and before that happens --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- they want to be on the defensive.
R:  Yeah, it's, it's a difficult situation, I don't know where it's going.  But, ah, ... [SIGH] who knows. 
L:  I just hope it comes out fairly decent the end -- in the end, not that we're much worse off than we've been before any of the terroristic action started here with nine eleven --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- and everything since then.
R:  Yeah.  One, one of the things that, that's a bit frustrating is that in -- I don't know how to address this, but, ah, it seems all the action that's taken in response to nine eleven and everything, it's always, it's always, um, ret-
