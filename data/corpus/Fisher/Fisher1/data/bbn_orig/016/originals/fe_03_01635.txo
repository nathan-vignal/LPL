R:  Hi, I'm Evelyn.
L:  Excuse me? 
R:  Hi, I'm Evelyn.
L:  Oh, I'm Christian.
R:  And what do you feel about what's going on over there? [NOISE]
L:  Um, Ah, at -- at first I really didn't -- I really wasn't for it but I guess we have to support our President, so, you know.
R:  Pardon, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, well, at first I wasn't for it but I guess we have to support our President and back him up.  What about you? 
R:  I don't think we -- we should support the President.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  No.  I think we should impeach his arse. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Would you shut up.  Man.  I don't think what's going on right now is right.
L:  Yeah, I mean neither do I.  I think though --
R:  I don't believe we should pay -- be paying for something that they should be paying for.  I mean, we don't have the resources they have.
L:  True.  It doesn't really make sense.
R:  We are going to pay billions of dollars to rebuild their country, yet -- what about, you know, the problems in our own country.
L:  True, true. [COUGH] So you agree to the Dixie Chicks and all that? 
R:  Yes, I don't think they should be ostracized for what they believe in.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, I don't really think war is the answer, but ... 
R:  We show a big gun, they're gonna show an even bigger gun.
L:  Yeah.  Do you think, um, Saddam Hussein is still alive? 
R:  I don't know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think they'd tell us.
L:  Yeah, tr- 
R:  I think the government lies to us.
L:  You think so? 
R:  Yes.  I think they're like the Mafia. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  They are the Mafia. Shut up.
L:  Who's that in the background? 
R:  Oh, my friend.
L:  Oh.  Yeah ... 
R:  [NOISE] No, you can't.  [NOISE] I don't know, they might not give us our ten dollars then.
L:  Do you know anyone that went to war? 
R:  Yeah, I know someone who's been over there.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Do you know anyone?
L:  No, I don't know anyone. [PAUSE]
R:  How old are you?
L:  Um, Eighteen.  What about you? 
R:  Twenty four. 
L:  Oh.  Where are you from?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You sound like you have a northern accent? 
R:  Pardon? 
L:  You sound like you're from the north.
R:  [NOISE] Chicago.
L:  Oh, from Texas. [PAUSE] 
R:  So ... when do you think they're gonna send our boys home? 
L:  Um, good question.  I really don't know.  I haven't really been keeping up with the war coverage.  When do you think they're coming back? 
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Do you keep up with it every day? 
R:  I keep up with it somewhat.  I don't watch it a lot but I do keep up with it.  [NOISE] Um, who exactly, I'm just a little sick of listening to it and now that, you know, they're going after other countries now, when is it gonna stop? 
L:  Yeah, after this one it's North Korea.
R:  No, now they're after Syria.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yes.
L:  I didn't even know that.
R:  Now they're saying they have chemical weapons and everything like that and now they want to start a war with Syria.
L:  Oh.  Wh- where's Syria? 
R:  I think Syr- -- it's in the same region. [NOISE] It's in the northern sector above Iraq.
L:  Do they have oil too or something? 
R:  Pardon?
L:  Do they have weapons? 
R:  I -- I wouldn't know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I think war's pointless right now.
R:  I think Bush is just trying to figure, -- you know, just finish what Daddy's doing, wh- what Daddy did.
L:  Yes.
R:  Daddy couldn't do it and he's trying to make Daddy proud.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not to mention he's money hungry and he wants the oil.
L:  Yeah, I think the oil's a big thing.
R:  We're paying taxes, you know, to send people over there.  We're paying for this war.  They're not paying for it.  We're paying -- we're paying to liberate another country.  What about the people that are in the streets right now starving that we have here? 
L:  True.
R:  We got, you know, homeless people.
L:  He just wants the oil.
R:  We have, you know, people struggling to make ends meet and here he is spending how many billions of dollars on this war to go over there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do -- what do we get in return from it?
L:  I don't think we get anything.  We got cheap gas, I think that's it.
R:  [NOISE] And what about North Korea?
L:  Um, are you asking me? 
R:  Yeah, what do you think of North Korea? 
L:  I mean, just because they have weapons, I mean, if we can trust them, I guess, I don't know.  I --
R:  I think Bush, I think Bush is, you know, opening his mouth too far.  I think if we get into anything with North Korea we're fucked. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Seriously.  You know what, have you seen their military? 
L:  Yeah, they have a lot of people. 
R:  Have you seen how they look though, it's like Hitler, it's very --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- scary.
L:  They have a -- they're pretty disciplined and organized over there.
R:  Exactly and ooh, yeah, we're really gonna do something with them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [NOISE] So what do you think of the Dixie Chicks and the whole -- against the President.
L:  Um, I -- I really don't care.  I'm not a Dixie Chicks fan or anything but, I mean, I guess they shouldn't have said that in public.
R:  They shouldn't have said it in public?
L:  If they feel that way then I guess it's cool.
R:  Pardon?
L:  I guess if they feel that way then they can say what they want, it's a free country.
R:  Exactly, just like Bush says what he wants. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I didn't vote for him, I didn't want him there.
L:  Oh, you didn't? 
R:  No --
L:  Did you vote for Gore?
R:  -- and you know what, and I think we need to really do away with the Electoral College.  He didn't get voted into office by the people.
L:  Yeah, that's true, just Electoral College.
R:  He only got it because his brother lost some ballots and changed them.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's just a little too --  his brother's governor of Florida and that was a whole conspiracy there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's fixed.
L:  So you voted for Gore? 
R:  I voted for Gore, yes.  I think Bush -- Bush doesn't care about the people.  He doesn't care about anybody but himself and filling his [PAUSE] are you just not -- you don't just -- you don't get into this?
L:  Who me? 
R:  Yeah, you don't watch -- 
L:  No, not really.
R:  -- anything like that?
L:  No.  I can't -- I think you're going -- I can't hear you. 
R:  [NOISE] We have ten minutes, shut up guys.
L:  How much more time do we have? 
R:  I have no idea.  I have no idea, I didn't pay attention to the clock.  Oh, actually, I think there's only like a minute or two left. [NOISE]
L:  Oh. 
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hey, I got into my end of the deal. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Would you -- would you join the military? 
L:  Yeah, I'd go fight.
R:  You'd go fight?
L:  Yeah. [COUGH] If they asked me to I'd go.
R:  Oh, only if they asked you to? 
L:  Yeah. I wouldn't do it voluntarily.
R:  So only if you were drafted basically.
L:  Yeah, pretty much.  I just turned eighteen so ... 
R:  Oh, you just turned eighteen? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you're still in high school?
L:  Yeah, I am graduating this year.  [PAUSE] Yeah. [MN] So you want him impeached? 
R:  Yeah, I think Bush -- we should be down with Bush man.  I think he should just, -- you know, it's like God bless the US, to hell with Bush.
L:  [LAUGH]  Pretty interesting phase -- phrase.  How many more years does he have, like one year left --
R:  Um, -- 
L:  -- or two years?  I think he's got two years left.
R:  Yes, yeah.  Two thousand and four would be the next election.
L:  If Gore was in then I don't think we would have gone to war.
R:  I think Gore would have found alternative ways.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think if anything, if we did go to war he would make sure we had UN backing.
L:  I don't think Bush had any patience or anything.  He just wanted to get into it.
R:  He just wants to jump the gun.  Him and Tony Blair, I think they're both butt buddies.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But Gore would have made sure we had the UN backing.  Bush on the other hand, he didn't give a fuck if they were behind us or not.
L:  Yeah, just went for it. [COUGH]
R:  And who's fronting the bill, we are.
L:  How much is it? 
R:  I think sixty billion.
