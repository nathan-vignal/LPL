R:  Yeah. 
L:  Hi. 
R:  How are you doing?
L:  Fine.  What's your name?  
R:  Jocelyn. 
L:  Jocelyn?
R:  Ahah. 
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Philadelphia. 
L:  Oh, okay, I am in California.  So, I guess we are talking about the Middle East peace process and all that stuff. 
R:  Ahah.  Can you --
L:  Ahah? 
R:  Can you talk louder?
L:  Um, yeah, how's this? 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  So, what do you think about the Middle East?
R:  I have no comment. 
L:  You don't have no comment?
R:  Mhm. 
L:  How are we going to talk for ten minutes on it?
R:  I don't know. 
L:  Were you -- were you, like, -- like watching the war on TV or anything?
R:  Ahah. 
L:  You were?
R:  Ahah. 
L:  What did you think about what happened?
R:  I don't think there should have been a war. 
L:  You don't think so?
R:  No. 
L:  Mhm. What about the -- the guy Saddam, though, you know, his bombs and things. 
R:  Huh? 
L:  What about Saddam and his -- in his -- in his, um, the things he was doing wrong every -- over there. 
R:  I don't think it was necessary. 
L:  You don't? 
R:  No. 
L:  You know, I -- I was at that way too myself and then someone sent me an email. 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  It was a guy -- it was from a guy that was like eighty years old and -- and he was, um, he was telling, talking about World War Two and how the, um, the -- the United Nations just sat on their hands and didn't do anything while all those, you know, Jewish people got killed by Hitler. 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  And he was saying that, you know, the reason, the only reason why we have friends is because we beat them in war. 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  That's all, and he -- I mean, he made a good point, he made a really good point about, you know, how things go.  Saddam Hussein was doing -- he was doing some pretty bad things over there to his people.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So, I don't know. 
R:  Mhm, what -- um, what do you think about the money they found?
L:  What money?
R:  [inaudible] on the news today, the money they found in the house. 
L:  They found money where?
R:  In the house. 
L:  In one of his houses?
R:  Ahah. 
L:  How much did they find?
R:  Ah, I think it was forty thousand and eighty bucks -- four thousand and eighty bucks or something like that. 
L:  Wow.  That was Saddam in one of his palaces. 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  [LAUGH] He's -- he's hoarding out his money.  Do you think he's dead or do you think he's alive?
R:  Alive. 
L:  You think he's alive? 
R:  Ahah.
L:  Yeah, I think he's in Syria myself too.  I bet you anything he is. 
R:  Yeah, I think so.  He has a whole bunch of look-alikes. 
L:  Yeah, I know.  He's probably been gone ... 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't know, I -- did -- man, we came over there, we came over there really -- really hard core.  I was looking at -- I was reading Time magazine -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and they were talking about the -- one of their, one of the helicopters or something we were using over there. 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  And this helicopter's bad.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Did you know about any of the -- of the -- the machines we were using?
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Did you hear about 'em at all?
R:  Uh-uh. 
L:  This thing, wait, let me find it, this thing was bad.  I was, like, oh my goodness, they didn't have a chance, poor things.  It was this helicopter, it's called, um, I think it's a Tomahawk. 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  And this helicopter can -- it can fly into an area, right. 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  It can find -- it can find and classify one hundred and twenty targets, it can, um, tell you which of those one hundred and twenty are the sixteen most dangerous, start an attack, that means launch its bombs it has, and then tell everyone in their -- and then transfer the data to other planes in the area all within thirty seconds.  Can you believe that?
R:  Uh-uh. 
L:  I was like whoa.  I mean, it's like, we have -- we have the technology going on for it. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I heard about this one guy [inaudible] the last time we were in the Gulf War, he was missing in action and they were wondering what happened to him, and it's been like ten years.  I didn't even know anyone was missing out of that first one.  
R:  Ah --
L:  The first Gulf War, you remember?
R:  Ahah.  You think they gonna find, ah, Saddam Hussein?
L:  I don't know, they can't find [NOISE] Osama Bin Laden, I don't know makes them think they're gonna find, um -- 
R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Oh. I don't know, they couldn't find in -- Osama Bin Laden.  I don't think they're really looking for him, I just think that they wanted him out of power and they wanted to get rid -- get off all -- get all of his weapons away from him. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  They just -- you know, they just wanted him out of there.  Because we can't be having no one having anthrax and smallpox. You could, you know, he could mail it to us or something, anything.  You know, I know he's got people -- 
R:  Ah.
L:  -- that -- that are in the United States right now probably that are waiting or, you know, the word to do some more terrorist activities against us. 
R:  Yeah, I think so too. 
L:  But see, I think that Saddam is the one that -- that -- that -- is the one that -- that made -- I mean, that ha- -- was helping Osama Bin Laden do what they did to the -- to the World Trade Centre. 
R:  Oh, yeah, I think so too. 
L:  So, you know, for that, I mean, I think somebody needs to pay for that because that was wrong.  They -- that hurt me, that hurt.  Anyway, I have never been to the World Trade Centre, I've never been in Europe but that hurt me real bad.  I mean it -- it was real personal to me and I was really -- I mean, if I could have gone to war I would have gone myself. 
R:  True? 
L:  Yeah, because, I mean, that's the way -- that's the way I felt about it.  I'm all the way in California and it was, like, I couldn't believe it, I could not believe it.  I sat there, I cried, I cried for those people. 
R:  Yeah, that was a shame. 
L:  Yeah, I really did and it was, like, that was so sad to me.  Anyway I -- I sent money over and I -- I did everything.  While I'm over here, you know, there's not much I can do but or- offer moral support, you know.  It's like it was just wrong, it was just -- there was no way I think that we should let that go. 
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  Hello. 
R:  Yeah, I hear you. 
L:  Oh, what's going on with that noise, it keeps clicking.
R:  Oh, no, that's the phone -- 
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- me pressing the button by accident. 
L:  Oh.  So how old are you?
R:  How old am I? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sixteen. 
L:  Are you?
R:  Ahah. 
L:  Oh, wow, okay.  You soun- -- you sound older. 
R:  Oh. 
L:  Did you sign up for -- for this, um, thing or your Mom did?
R:  My Mom.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  She just told me about it not so long ago. 
L:  Oh, okay. I have a sixteen year old daughter too. 
R:  Oh.  How old are you?
L:  I'm thirty nine. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  [LAUGH] Hear my kid crying? 
R:  Uh-huh.  What is the program about? 
L:  It's, um, I don't know, they are doing some kind of phone study and they record us talking about whatever the subject is.  The subject today was -- was -- was Baghdad --
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and -- and Iraq and we have to talk for ten minutes and then they pay us ten dollars a call. 
R:  Oh, she didn't tell me all that.  She didn't say it. 
L:  Pardon? 
R:  She didn't tell me that.  She just told me that a program was gonna call. 
L:  Oh, okay.  Yep.  Yeah, we -- we bombed all of his stuff.  I guess we had better stay on topic though.  We bombed -- we -- I'm looking at this, the Time magazine, it's like showing us all these pictures and it's, like, totally cool.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, it's like the way we went in there, we went in there like -- like we weren't gonna take no -- no, nothing for granted now. [PAUSE]  Hello. 
R:  Mhm. I hear you. 
L:  Okay, I don't know, I can probably -- 'cause it goes -- it goes dead and makes a dead sound. 
R:  No, 'cause the phone -- I think the phone button did that. 
L:  Oh, okay. Yep. 
R:  This, um, -- the program just started today. 
L:  No, it's been going on for a while.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It's been going on for a while.  This is my first call today though.  I just started last night. 
R:  Oh, over -- over the Internet?
L:  Yeah, Mhm. 
R:  Is your daughter signed up, you signed your daughter up? 
L:  No, I just signed me up with -- I was just saying I have a sixteen year old daughter too.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  If I'm not here she'd probably be answering -- she'd be probably doing it like you are. [PAUSE] Yep. [several inaudible words]
R:  Are you saying they should kill Saddam Hussein? 
L:  No, not nec- necessarily kill him but, you know, I'm just glad he's out of power.  Because, you know, it makes me kind of worried that -- knowing that he had smallpox and anthrax and, you know, all the things that he could just, you know, try to put up -- put on us.  I'm glad he's not in -- in control of those weapons any more because he doesn't have any sense.  I mean, he -- he's put -- he's killed his own people. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  You know, he -- they have, like, -- they have, like, rape squads over there, did you know that?
R:  Mhm. 
L:  They have rape squads.  Well, if they want information out of you and you won't give it, they will send a rape squad over there to rape your daughter and your wife. 
R:  Oh, that's a shame. 
L:  That's sad.  Isn't that sad?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like "Oh, my God."
R:  His own people?
L:  His own people, yeah, yeah.  He had -- he had all these statues of himself everywhere, he has pictures up everywhere.  He had every street was almost was named Saddam Street, Saddam Avenue, Saddam Lane, everything.  The people, they were scared.  They even thought about thinking, you know, like over here we can say our government is this, our government is that, --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- over there you die if you say something like that.  They would just kill you straight out fair.  Those people, they were scared, they were scared to death.  He just, -- you know, he didn't -- he didn't take no mess.  He just, like, you're doing it my way or you're gonna die.  That's the only way he did that -- that's what -- that's what he did.  They were living, -- you know, they were living in terror over there.  It's like, well, he's, you know, he's got his own people hostage but, you know, and now he's gonna come over -- and -- and -- and kill our trade centre and kill all our -- our people.  You know that's like three thousand people. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I couldn't believe that.  When I saw that, I thought it was a movie, when I saw it on TV.  It's like, "Is this a movie."   I kept seeing it live and it couldn't -- wouldn't register.  And I went "Oh, my God", I couldn't believe it. 
R:  It's a shame. 
L:  Yeah, it was just like -- it hurt my heart, it's like someone came into my own house and -- and did something like that to my own house.  That's how I felt about it even though I've never been in New York. 
R:  I wonder if he had wife and kids. 
L:  Huh?
R:  I said I wonder if he had wife and kids.
L:  He's got -- yeah, he's got a bunch of wives. 
R:  How do they feel?
L:  How do they feel? 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, we -- we can't -- don't talk to them.  That's what they -- over there they have -- they have more than one wife over there. 
R:  Ah. 
L:  His wife and kids.  But they -- they saw -- they said they saw him -- him and his sons going into this one building but I don't know if it's really him or one of his look-alikes.  Because if I'd been a look alike of him I would have been, like, out of town.
