R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Lynn.
L:  I'm Dorinda.
R:  Hello [LAUGH], um --
L:  Hello.
R:  -- d- do you wanna go first?
L:  Oh, I don't care.
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you want me to go first?
R:  Sure.
L:  Okay, um, well, I, um, I'm not sure that it does that much because I -- I'm not real sure that they, um -- well, I -- I flew, um, last month and -- well, I flew actually end of February, March and, um, they check your bags and sometimes it doesn't seem like they -- they check 'em really, really that good.  Like they see all the -- maybe the littler things you could put in 'em.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, like, they were saying that some people are being stopped for, you know, nail files and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that kinda stuff and I had stuff like that in some of my luggage and they didn't get any of that.  They didn't even stop it at the metal detector.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't --
L:  So, I'm not --
R:  -- flown -- I haven't flown in, well, a few years at least and, uh -- so, I haven't been through the checkout since they've changed things --
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I think that we need to have marshalls -- armed marshalls on the planes if they really want to secure the flights, like they do --
L:  Oh, r- --
R:  -- in Israel.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, just have security there, armed, ready, because even with the pilots having guns, I mean, I -- I hate the thought of the guy driving the plane up there in a gun fight --
L:  Right, while you're --
R:  You know -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- while you're riding on his airplane.  That's a little bit scary.
R:  Isn't it though?  I know, and, uh, [SIGH] so I [SIGH] -- I don't like the idea of flying.  I think it might be a hair safer, but I -- I think about all the people who work at the airports who have access to baggage and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, how many planted terrorists are still working with airlines?
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  And not only that, but how many people making that little bit of money couldn't be bought off?
R:  Oh, completely.
L:  That's -- that's what I worry about.  That they -- you know, they don't pay those guys so much and someone comes and maybe offers them fifty thousand dollars --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and it would be really, really hard to trace who put it actually on the plane.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, they've gotta -- to me there's gotta be something, you know, they could do --
R:  Something better.
L:  -- maybe ev- -- maybe more than one person loading it on the plane, or watching it at all times, or, it's --
R:  Yeah, I think El Al -- ever since they started having armed guards I don't think they've had a hijacking or an incident in years, since they've done that and, um, I mean, you hate to think of it being like that, but boy [SIGH] after nine eleven --
L:  Y- --
R:  I mean, my god.
L:  Yeah, I think I would feel a lot safer knowing that there was somebody sitting in the front of the plane that had a gun.
R:  Mhm.  Who was hired just to patrol the airplane.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's -- I mean, it's just not like a bus, it's just, you know, once you're up there you're [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, you don't want the pilot coming out and start --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, like you said, exchanging gunfire with somebody.
R:  Exactly, and I feel like, you know, it really puts the flight attendants in such a weird position.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, how many times have you flown since nine eleven?
L:  Um, one, two -- twice, I think.
R:  Oh, really?  Where -- 
L:  Yeah, not very much.  
R:  -- where do ou live?
L:  I live in California.
R:  Oh, do you?  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm up in Washington.  Where did you fly to?
L:  I -- I just flew from Southern California to Northern California.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I didn't fly real far, but still, uh, it -- you know, it gave me that uneasy feeling in my stomach when we were going through security and, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you see people and -- and, um, you know, you just, you're really -- it makes you really look at the people who are getting on your [LAUGH] flight.
R:  Right.  I'll bet it does.  I --
L:  And you know, you don't -- go ahead.
R:  Oh no, I -- oh no, you go ahead. [LAUGH]
L:  I was just going to say, you know, you don't wanna be racist or anything, but it's kinda scary, you're like, okay, you know.
R:  Oh, I know, it's [LAUGH] -- you can't help but do the little racial profiling [SIGH] thing --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, we know who, generally, we're kinda looking for.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think that if a private company was in charge of security, rather than the government, I'd feel better.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Because at least it would be competitive and, you know, they'd have to do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, instead of, you know, just the typical gov- -- you don't work for the government, do you?
L:  No.
R:  Government worker [LAUGH].  You know what I mean?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in that way, I don't know how much safer it really is, ex- unless, you know, it's just been a deterrent because they've already done the big airplane incident and now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're gonna look for other ways to do something horrible.
L:  Right, and it's -- and it's hard because they have all this security as far as whether you, uh, you know, could pull up to the curb or not and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  When we, uh, flew -- when I flew, um, late February, early March, they were on high alert, so you couldn't even pull up to the curb.  They were checking cars as you drove into the airport --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, I mean, before you ever even stepped, you know, a foot onto where the terminals were you were -- they were searching cars and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- that kinda stuff, so that -- that made me feel a little secure.  At least they were searching the cars so that nobody could --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, just drive a car up there and just leave it.
R:  Right.  
L:  And they get really --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- yeah, they get really, really, um, up tight if you park too long when you're -- even when you're just picking people up --
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know -- I don't know if they figure, you know, that somebody's gonna sit there for a while and, you know, have a car bomb or whatever, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I -- I don't know.  I -- I still think that, uh, like you said the marshalls would be the best idea.
R:  I do too.  I mean --
L:  B- --
R:  -- they're there.  You know, it's just if the world's come to that then -- I mean, with all these international flights and people who can connect from here to there --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, especially that.
L:  Right, and all the disguises they could use to get on the plane.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, I mean, look what they did to -- I mean, look what they're doing to Iraq -- in -- some of our military where they're, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- c- coming at 'em like they're friendly and then --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- shooting 'em down so, I mean, it's not like you could just trust that they're --
R:  Nope.  It's -- they're sneaky [LAUGH] and they're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I think -- and fe- -- you know, how many people are looking for women suicide bombers?
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Probably -- probably not very many and that's probably what they're gonna use next.
R:  Right.  Some woman dressed in a business suit, you know.  Yeah, it's pretty creepy.  The whole thing's pretty bad.  I -- I don't -- you know, we're taking vacations, we're gonna drive to California.  I'd rather drive [LAUGH] than fly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- right now.  I guess if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had to fly I'd do it, but I sure don't -- that -- I -- I didn't like to fly much before and now --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Right, and then, you know, especially like for someone like me who lives in California, the -- that's like a huge target.
R:  I know.
L:  You know, it's --
R:  Isn't LAX --
L:  -- you know, they think -- 
R:  -- like the targeted airport, or ...
L:  That's what they say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what they say.  It'll be the next target if there's a major thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it'll probably be LAX, or Chicago, so --
R:  Mhm.  Which is really --
L:  You know.
R:  -- scary, you know.
L:  Right.  So, I'm not -- I'm not convinced that all the extra stuff is extra enough. [LAUGH]
R:  Right [LAUGH], right.  I --
L:  Might need a little bit more --
R:  -- agree with you.  I'd rather have a --
L:  Might need a -- sh- might need a little more extra.
R:  Mhm.  I know, I wonder what it would take for marshalls, another incident?  You know, I mean --
L:  Yeah.  Well, I thought they were putting them -- I heard that they were putting them on some flights --
R:  Oh, really, I won- --
L:  But I don't know if it --
R:  Mm, I wonder which ones, like the --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- postal ones from coast to coast, or ...
L:  I don't know because, you know, people have to get into our country some way too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, are they watching the ones who c- -- is airport security watching the ones who are coming in, you know, internationally?
R:  Right, well look at that guy they let in from London.  I think his name was something like Richard Smith, but not only did he look completely crazy, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- deranged, and he only had a one way ticket, he was -- I mean, and I just -- this is where people start screaming about racial profiling but I don't care --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm sorry.  He looked like he was from the Middle East and he looked --
L:  Right, with that kind of name. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, Richard Smith, from the Middle East and he looked completely deranged, a one way ticket and, you know, [LAUGH] that --
L:  Was he the shoe bomber guy?
R:  What's that?
L:  Was he the shoe bomber guy?
R:  Um, I don't remember if he was the shoe guy, but he was one of 'em a while back that they -- they did get and he had something on him.  It might've been the shoe guy who was lighting his shoe  on -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, my god.  It's just crazy.
L:  Right, and they got in a -- you'd think that'd be your first tip off, you got somebody who looks ...
