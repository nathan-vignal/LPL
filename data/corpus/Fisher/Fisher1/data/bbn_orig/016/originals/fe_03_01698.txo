R:  Hello?
L:  H- hi, I'm Caroline.
R:  Hi Caroline, this is Julie from Washington.
L:  You're in Washington State?
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  I'm i- -- I'm in Reno right now, but we're from California.
R:  Oh, okay.  So are we. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you?
R: [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Yeah, we're up -- we're up here doing some merchandising.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you a shopper?
R:  I am, which is --
L:  You are?
R:  -- p- pretty interesting, yeah.
L:  Are you on [inaudible] list?
R:  I am, but, oh, we better not --
L:  I --
R:  -- we better not risk our anonymity here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Good, we know each other then.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, probably, [SIGH] possibly.
L:  Yeah, we're best team -- we're -- we're the best team shoppers.  You'll know who I am.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah. [LAUGH] Hi, Alden[?]. [LAUGH]
L:  She said, "Hi". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  Hey.
L:  Anyway, Middle East. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, the Middle East.  Um, you wanna --
L:  I --
R:  -- start, or --
L:  Yeah, I don't care.
R:  Let me think about it.
L:  But, uh, I was going to say, I was thinking, I -- I think it was necessary, and I think that a lot of the -- the people demonstrating, like in Baghdad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's a city of two and half million people, and there's only a thousand people demonstrating.  You know, that's not even one percent, and I --
R:  And it's all the m- -- and it's all men.  I don't see any women and children demonstrating, which makes me think --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that it's a set up.
L:  Yeah.  It -- and I think it's the, um, [inaudible] or whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I think that -- I think it's Saddam's men still in there, trying to cause trouble --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- doing it and -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] not the, um, regular everyday citizens of [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  You know?
R:  -- I completely agree with you.  It was [SIGH] something we had to do.  I have a lot of family members that -- that are over there right now, um --
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah, my sister in law's in Baghdad, so, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, no, it's okay, she's a Marine and she's happy to be there, [SIGH] um --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  My h- -- yeah.  And she's just, you know, they're p- -- [MN] they, um, CNN and stuff showing people that aren't happy, well, that's a big lie. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, she says --
L:  It's just like a minority of the people?
R:  Yeah, she says she doesn't know where they're finding these people, because what she sees is completely opposite of that.
L:  This should go down on a list.  Everybody would love to hear that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That would make -- I've got to tell -- my girlfriend's son is over somewhere --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she just knows he was sent to Kuwait, but she has no idea where he is.
R:  Oh, she's -- she --
L:  He's, like, twenty one.
R:  -- doesn't hear from him?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he's married, and before he went, she thought he was gone for about three weeks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and his wife didn't tell him, and so she's, like, you know, I think they changed it so they'd notify the family if something happens too, but he hasn't called or anything and --
R:  Oh, well, maybe he's in an area where he doesn't have the ability to do that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, or working --
L:  But she'll -- that'll make her feel better, to tell her -- to hear that.
R:  Yeah, well, h- --
L:  That's everything's good over there.
R:  Yeah.  How long do you think they're going to be there?
L:  I feel -- we're still in Afghanistan.  I -- I can't -- I -- I think it would be a miracle to get out for under a year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, we're going to have to have Americans over there, w- -- not just to keep the peace, but I think they're going to need people over there to, um, to advise in peace, you know, 'cause they don't how to do a democracy and -- and all this stuff, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all that, but a- a- as, you know, probably more the advisors or, you know, I think it's going to take a while to get everybody out.  Like, they're still finding, um, what do they call those people, um, Bin Laden is -- Al Qaeda.
R:  Al Qaeda, yes.
L:  They're still finding them in Afghanistan, you know?  At least they tell us more what's going on over there too.
R:  Yeah, a- --
L:  But they're still -- they're still there, and, um, I think it's going to take a while to get 'em, and -- and, you know, they might not ever get 'em all.
R:  No, no.  They won't.
L:  But -- but it's gonna -- I think it -- I think we're going to be there a while, but not, you know, the force that they have.  But I did find it interesting that they bought two carriers home and then somebody said they thought they were shipping out [LAUGH] a- another, you know, somebody they knew was -- just got shipped out over there from --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- Washington, you know?
R:  Well, uh, they always rotate 'em because, you know some of the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the guys on the Lincoln, they'd been out for over nine months --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they all have families, so -- it mi- --
L:  But they didn't -- they didn't say that they were rotating, they said they were bringing 'em home.
R:  Oh, well, they are bringing them ho- -- they're bringing some home, um, the Carl Vincent's supposed to be coming home.  Uh, they're over in Korea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and then -- s- shoot, we live near a Navy base, so I'm trying [LAUGH] to figure out what else.
L:  Really?
R:  But there were, um, there are people coming home, b- but they're -- they're going to be on a rotation for a while and it -- I kind of feel sorry for all the people who were forward deployed because they're going to be out a lot more than I think they had planned to be. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but, um, it's k- --
L:  M- -- we were kind of scared.  My son in law's in the -- in the, um, Reserves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he -- he was, you know, we were afraid he was going to get called up, 'cause he's got young children too.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, and I was just, ah ... really concerned about, uh, him going, because when he went to boot camp, his son wasn't even e- eighteen months old --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he just -- he would not talk, you know, he just -- it -- it affected him so much that he refused to even try to talk --
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  -- and, um, he still -- his speech -- he's five now and his speech isn't normal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now -- now there -- there might be something wrong with him, but -- but -- and then on top of it, Terry got hurt.
R:  Oh, that's hard for a kid to understand.
L:  And -- yeah, and so, um, he's got -- he hurt his back, so I don't think they will take him anyway, but we're kind of glad to see it spe- w- winding down.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, I don't know --
L:  So --
R:  -- my brother's a Reserve.  He got called up, but he works -- they called him up to take a place in Penalton so somebody else could go, and he was kind of raring to go, he was, like, you know, wanted to be over there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but of course his wife's there, so that might have do -- [LAUGH] make some difference, but --
L:  Oh yeah, I'm sure. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but, um --
L:  Yeah, it's the separation from family that's hard.  Terry would go, he wouldn't, you know, he wouldn't question it -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's just, you know, 'cause of the kids, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause that's what he signed up for, and then he got hurt and he's got this thing wrong with his back now.  I c- -- I don't even know how he's working.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, um --
R:  That's rough, that's rough.  Well, uh, like you said though, it did have to be done, you know --
L:  Yeah, I think so, I think so.  
R:  -- and -- and it's got to be --
L:  Because if -- if we didn't go get him, we -- the -- the Twin Towers was just the start --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- you know?
R:  The ones that they --
L:  And if they don't get -- it's, like, now I'm -- I'm kind of concerned about Syria, are we going to have to do the same thing?
R:  Oh yeah, we are. [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Because we're going to have -- because they've got the terrorists over there too --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and they know that.  And -- and I'm, like, "Okay.  This is -- it looks like -- like, um Bush is globe trotting kind of".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it, you know, it -- it's hard to say, you know?  Of course, Syria hasn't really done anything really bad against us like Iraq was, you know?
R:  Well, I think they'll find 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  I think they'll find it, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think if -- I think if Syria's smart, they'll just let people in and get rid of their stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think so too, but I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think that we're going after 'em anyway.  A- --
L:  But I liked the way Bush did it.  You know, I --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- like the idea that he tried to, you know, pinpoint things, and it's like the Russians, I thought it was funny when they left, because they said, um ... um, what was it?  Oh, they said that war was getting too close to them, and somebody says, "Yeah, like what was -- was there, uh, uh, weapons parked outside your door?" and they're, like, "Yeah", [LAUGH] you know?  Well, what do you expect?
R:  [MN] Well, Pu- --
L:  And then one of the neighborhoods where they found that missile, did you see that picture?
R:  Huh-uh.
L:  Right in the middle of a housing area, they found -- there was a missile there and they said it -- they were so scared that they'd get bombed, because that --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- missile was there.
R:  Well, Putin's evil, so I mean, [LAUGH] he just is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's an evil guy, so [LAUGH] it's a --
L:  Oh, who is that?
R:  Vladimir Putin, the head guy over in Russia.
L:  Oh, that's Russia, yeah.
R:  Yeah, he's evil.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I'm really glad Bush is in office.  It's just --
L:  I don't know a whole lot about him, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- yeah, and I've got more confidence in him than I have in a president in a long time.
R:  Yeah, that's exactly it.
L:  You know?
R:  I can't remember ever, in my lifetime, trusting a president.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I certainly --
L:  I think I kind of trusted Carter a little bit.
R:  W- well, but Carter was so --
L:  But he was --
R:  -- naive and the people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he surrounded himself with were -- did not have the purest of intentions. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  But, I mean --
L:  -- that's true.
R:  Car- Carter himself was smart, you know, you -- you figure a nuclear physicist --
L:  Uh-huh, and Ford was okay --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but [LAUGH] -- but I didn't have -- Bush, you just -- I just got a lot of confidence in him.
R:  Yeah, me too.  And it -- it --
L:  You know, I think he knows -- he seems to know what he's doing.
R:  -- it's kind of scary to actually trust somebody, you know? [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Oh, when I heard this thing on the radio, this blurb, and it was a story about this guy that -- that in World War Two he was, um, his plane was shot down
