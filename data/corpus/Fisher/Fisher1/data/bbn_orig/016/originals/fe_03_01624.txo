L:  Hello, my name is Jeffery White.  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my name is Jeffery White.
R:  Oh, hello, my name is Toni Henley.
L:  Oh, they were speaking of -- of peace, uh, in the -- in the West.
R:  Uh, in the -- in the Middle East, isn't it?
L:  Y- uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I really think that there's gonna be peace because this will grow[?] at once.  I'm a spiritual person.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think that god is gonna have peace everywhere soon as we de- decide to have peace -- peace in ourselves.
R:  I certainly hope that you're right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, hon- honestly I don't feel that we -- we're gonna have peace over there, simply because from my own personal knowledge, I think that those countries have been warring with each other for as far back as there's been recorded history.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I don't see 'em stopping now. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, but I -- I believe -- I believe -- and I understand where you coming from too --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I accept your opinion --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I do think that, as I said, god is peace --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he is -- he's -- he's gonna make peace one day and as soon as they stop fighting and hurting one another and accept Christ as their personal savior into their country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that things going to change.
R:  I tend to believe you -- believe in that if they would in fact accept Jesus Christ, but I don't think those people in that country believe in god and Chri- Christ and -- they have their own funicular[?] religion.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they do -- they do --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they really do and I --
R:  An- and I think a lot of their problems is -- has to do with relig- -- I mean, a lot of their warring is, in their eyes, is for religion.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which I totally don't understand. [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- I totally don't understand either, but I continuously pray that -- I -- I pray and I do believe that one day things gonna get better.
R:  I hope so.
L:  I -- I may not see it, uh, but, uh, I mean, it may happen fifty, sixty years from now.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I hope and pray to --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- god that, uh, something will happen that there will be peace.
R:  Right, I think there is a better chance --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for it with, um, that regime gone over there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, if they try to bring democracy -- I -- I think there's a better chance for peace now than there was maybe ten years ago.
L:  Mhm, right, right.
R:  Um, but I don't see it happening in the near future.  I mean, because of the fact that you already have so many of the other countries over there; Iran --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and some of the other ones that are already saying, "No, we're not gonna recognize an American --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- leadership in Iraq".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, but I -- I do think -- now, it -- I don't mean it's gonna happen next week.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's gonna happen.
R:  I believe it will eventually.
L:  Yeah, eventually it will happen.
R:  I mean, surely to goodness you can't have [LAUGH] --
L:  I hope that, uh --
R:  Right, I -- I don't think it can be like the Hatfields and McCoys for ever. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  
R:  So --
L:  And -- and that's exactly what it is.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's -- y- you -- y- you -- y- you put it right on the spot.  That's exactly what it is.
R:  Just, um -- I don't know.  Personally I think it's -- I think everybody would be a lot better off if there wasn't a feuding over property anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's -- basically what it boils down to is the State saying, "No, everything here belongs to us and the people can't have anything --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- but what we allow".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and that's just -- I don't know.  I believe every person should have their own opportunities.
L:  Right, right.  I do believe that.  I don't think that -- it's -- it's -- it's more so mind controlling, uh, s- one -- one man, who I call a demon --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, is, uh taking over minds.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and -- and -- and that's what he's doing and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, the people are afraid to -- to do what they supposed to do the right way.
R:  Right.
L:  Because he -- he tells them the right way and the wrong way.  They have no minds of their own.
R:  Exactly.  I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it'll probably take several generations --
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
R:  -- for that country to overcome that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, because you've got people over there that for their whole lives have lived this way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I can't imagine how it's gonna be for them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to try to change their whole way of thinking.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um --
L:  But -- but w- once -- once -- I believe once they allow the man upstairs to come into their country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It'll be straightened because --
R:  Do you think that'll happen?
L:  I -- I hope and pray it does.  I can't say --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I do believe it will.
R:  Right, I mean, we're just talking opinions, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and thoughts and I just really wonder as -- as religious as the -- the people seem to be over there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  With, you know, stopping and going to the temple several times a day and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things like that.  I -- I just wonder if they will ever -- what it would take for them to accept --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- god, rather than -- 
R:  You know --
L:  -- than the --
R:  [NOISE] Well, the- --
L:  What is it they believe in, Allah?
R:  I -- they -- that's what I was gonna say.  They don't believe in -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't know 'cause I never been there and I don't knock nobody's religion or beliefs --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, I don't think they serve the same god that we serve.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] You know, I think they just serve this man or statue, or whatever, [NOISE] but god is not a statue.
R:  Right, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, as a matter of fact my husband and I had this debate the other day, um, about -- because I was trying to explain to him what I had read about how, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they -- they believe that everybody over here in America is evil.
L:  Uh, yeah, oh yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That we're just -- we're evil, terrible people.
L:  We -- we evil people, but they wanna come over here.  
R:  [LAUGH] It's hard to --
L:  You know, I -- why you wanna come we so evil?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but I thank god that they come over here and receive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Christ as their personal savior, but why are we so evil?  What have we done that was -- that's so evil to them?  Bec- because we don't believe what they believe in?
R:  That's all I can imagine.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's all I can imagine that it could --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- well, and -- and -- what was it, Osama Bin Laden?
L:  Mhm.
R:  He basically said that.
L:  Mm.
R:  That, um, we were the infidels because, um, we didn't worship their god.
L:  Right. [NOISE] [MN] I -- I mean, the word -- the -- the -- the word that I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- live by is, one god, one face, one belief.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's he [NOISE], himself. 
R:  Right.
L:  That's what I believe.  If -- if -- if -- if the bible tells me that and I read it [NOISE], it's gotta be true.
R:  Right.  Well, and I don't think I've ever read in the bible where --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it says, "Go out and slaughter an entire country".
L:  No, it d- d- does not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It does not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It definitely doesn't say that.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It does not say that.
R:  So, um, I think -- on -- back onto the topic though, I think possibly peace can be achieved eventually, but I don't think it'll happen probably not even in my lifetime.
L:  [NOISE] No, no it won't happen in my lifetime.  I'm almost fifty years old and I don't think that it will happen --
R:  Well, I'm --
L:  -- during my lifetime.
R:  -- I'm almost thirty [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I don't think it's gonna happen in mine either.
L:  Oh -- Oh you the same age as my daughter. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, okay, but --
R:  So, um --
L:  I really don't, but I hope and pray to god that it will.
R:  Right, and I agree with you on that and I pray for the -- pray for our soldiers every night.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  And the families that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have -- have lost so much from this.
L:  Mhm.  And then -- and what really touched me was a nineteen year old kid who was not able to live a life.  A lifetime of what I've lived.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that showed me how blessed I am [NOISE] that I was able to live and he's ni- -- he was nineteen years old.
R:  Goodness.
L:  Then -- then the, uh, the, uh, uh, POWs, uh, all of that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bothered me, but I -- I praise god that they got back home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All of 'em got back home and -- and -- and the war today is not bec- -- it -- it's unnecessary.
R:  Right.
L:  It's totally unnecessary.
R:  I don't think that it should've ever been started.  I don't think that it was any of our business --
L:  I --
R:  -- really. [SIGH] I think that, as a country, um, if the people were that unhappy with how things were being done, they should've had an uprising against him. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  There was more civilians than there were Army. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, I mean, you know, over here if we don't like our President, guess what?  He goes out of office.
L:  Uh-huh, [LAUGH] right.
R:  If enough people don't like him, we don't keep him.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You know, and it just seems to me like there are a lot of people -- a lot of the civilians over there, who weren't complaining.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I'm sure a lot of 'em were and I'm sure a lot of 'em really were being treated bad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it doesn't se- -- it seems like there were a lot of people who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who were happy with him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, in watching the news and watching all the people that were going up and hugging him and cheering him and stuff --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- with our soldiers right there to protect 'em if they didn't and -- and they still did.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then I saw, um, an aerial photograph --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of where they pulled down the statue of Saddam --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's been in the news so much lately and yet from the aerial photo you could see that it wasn't such a great big crowd like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what we've been led to believe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, from an aerial view it only looked like maybe a hundred people out there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in a city of thousands.
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  So, I mean, I just -- it -- there's a part of me that has to wonder, you know, exactly what was this war supposed to have been about?
L:  Right, and -- and -- and what, uh, what bothers me and puzzles me a lot, uh, is that when they blow up these different places, uh, buildings and [NOISE] hospitals, uh, killing kids -- we killing babies who have not even known life, period.
R:  Yeah, that's exactly right.
L:  I mean, how in the world can they think they can answer to that?
R:  [SIGH] I don't know and I'm glad I ...
