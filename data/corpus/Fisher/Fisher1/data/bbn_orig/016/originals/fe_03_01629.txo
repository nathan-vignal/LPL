L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Angelie[?].
R:  Hi, I'm -- I'm Deb.  How are you? 
L:  How -- I'm okay, how are you? 
R:  Oh, good.  Are you from the States?
L:  Ah, yes, I'm from Philadelphia.  How about you? 
R:  Oh, okay, I'm Mount Joy, Lancaster, you know Lancaster, right outside Lancaster.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, [NOISE] so the Middle East, what a topic -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that could be a -- an easy one to talk about for a change, anyway.  A lot -- lot -- lot you can talk about.  Um, I, ah, I'm one of those for -- I think we've done, you know what -- what has gone on over there has been good.  I think -- I think it's good that we stepped in.
L:  Mm, I definitely agree.
R:  Do you?  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, um. 
R:  I know there's some very much against it.
L:  Well, I just feel as though, I mean, we have to -- I mean, right now I think that, um, that the US and Israel share a common enemy and, I mean, it just makes sense -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- that, you know, we should be allying ourselves with them, you know, ... 
R:  I agree. 
R:  So ...
L:  I agree an- and I think too part I think not only do we have to do it to protect ourselves, um, but I think someone needed to help -- help the people.
L:  I agree.  I mean, an- and if we're supposed to be a big country that's, like -- like, you know, the protector of all the other democracies and supposed to be supporting those countries which are, you know, um, which are part of, you know, the democratic world, then, you know, it just makes sense that we would be supporting them.
R:  I agree, I agree, and I get angry that, you know, the people that say we, you know, because we are big and we're powerful and we take [NOISE] too much, um, too much charge but, you know what, nobody else does.  I mean -- [NOISE] 
L:  Exactly, like, if it's not us, then who? 
R:  Right, right, so, you know, they would have just left a gallon and, of course, we were the ones that had the big nine one one so --
L:  Of course. 
R:  Um, --  
L:  It just shows that it could happen to us, you know, so ... 
R:  Exactly.  Um, and I think, ah, I think th- I think we'll eventually -- I honestly don't -- I think they said do you think there will ever be peace?  Ah, there's always going to be something, you know.  If it's not, ah, Iraq, it will be Afghanistan or, you know, Korea or somebody, um, but I think this is a big step, um, [NOISE] toward -- I think Iraq was huge as far as a problem for us and for everyone really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and -- and there's always going to be somebody, there's always going to be something that -- that, you know, is causing problems but I think this is huge and the fact that we're, you know, gonna keep going until, you know -- until the -- the regime is knocked out or until we find Osama or -- or something, um, is a big thing, although I think that will take a while.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  If we ever find them.
L:  Right. It's just this is a complicated -- been going on, you know, since pretty much the beginning.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah, right. 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  So I just -- I just don't see how it could be resolved any time soon.
R:  No.  
L:  But -- 
R:  No, no, and even, um, you know, organizing Iraq right now.  You know, I think that will take a long time.  I mean, there's a country that has been [NOISE] first under this strong arm and now, now they're tasting freedom and, of course, with freedom comes, like, that deluding and stuff.  I think they're gonna wanna kinda stretch their wings a little bit and -- and I think it will take a little bit to get a democracy or whatever kind of government over there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I can't imagine what that must be like.  Ah, like I said, having been under his, um, charge for so many years -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and now they can kinda do what they want, I think that's gonna be tough.  I think, honestly, you know, the fighting was hard because of the killing and all that, but I think this is going to be a, ah, a tough job for, you know, whoever decides to help out or, you know, put their -- what do you think as far as -- do you think we should, ah, you know, this whole United States versus the UN, you know, organizing the government?
L:  Um, I -- I kinda think that it's the only way but I'm not sure if it's gonna be effective, you know. 
R:  Right, right.  I mean, it's hard.  And -- and -- and getting -- part of me thinks, okay, you know, France, for example.  Oh, the United States isn't going to have the Seine, I'm thinking, you know what, we're the one who freed them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think everybody needs to jump in and add their two cents but I think we need to lead it.  I think we should be kind of the -- the in charge ones and let everybody else, you know, give their opinions and -- and input and stuff but, um, like that, like, you know, like, the ones that have really opposed us and really put us down, um, I don't know, I don't think they should have a lead role in it, that's for sure.
L:  Mhm, mhm, yeah. 
R:  Not that I know a whole lot about government people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't.  I think I've learned more this past three weeks than -- that I've known my whole life.
L:  Right.  I just -- I try to avoid it, you know, because I find it pretty depressing.
R:  It's get- -- yeah, you know what, at first I was glued, I was absolutely glued to the TV, um, and now I don't -- I don't even watch it every, you know, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- besides little bits and pieces I hear on the station or something, I don't even really know what's going on.  Although it would be interesting to see how they organize, you know, a country that has been so, you know, maintained by one man, um, it -- it seems like an overwhelming job to me.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Um, but I think we can do it.  I mean, we've done it I think before somewhat.  Um, like I said, I just -- I worry about, you know, Syria now and -- and whoever else, um, that it will continue and I hope, you know, I hope that they see how quickly we -- we took over Iraq and -- and cleared that, that they won't do anything stupid or anything.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Well, there's -- there's no telling, right? 
R:  Right, exactly.  And the whole thing with him, you know, possibly being alive, who -- who knows what's up with that but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It would be easier if we knew for sure obviously but, yeah, I mean, I do think -- I think there will be a much more sense of peace.  I don't think -- I don't think in our lifetime there's ever going to be a total worldly peace, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it can -- it can be much better but unfortunately I think there's gonna be always those Saddam type followers and -- and Osama foll- followers and stuff that are going to cause more problems than, you know, but --
L:  So it's fanatics, right? 
R:  Right, right, exactly.  And I'm sure there's some left in this country too, I'm sure, you know, whether or not they're just laying low or what, but I can't believe we have ridded them all from here too.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, mm. [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I always love these stands.  Have you -- have you done many of these calls? 
L:  Yeah, about, ah, I guess five maybe.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can you do more than three?
L:  Um, a day? 
R:  No, I thought you could only do three total.
L:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I think, um, I think it's maybe three a day, I'm not sure.
R:  Oh, okay, okay, all right, because this is my third.  This is only my third but I've -- I've actually had to call this time, I've called all three of them.
L:  Oh, really? 
R:  Yeah.  No- nobody ever calls me.
L:  Yeah.  There was one day where I think I received, like, four calls. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But, then -- since then it hasn't -- it hasn't been like that.
R:  Yeah.  That was a lot.  Now, how many did you, um, or how did you find out about this place?
L:  Um, a friend of mine, um, just told me.  She's involved with it, so ... 
R:  Yeah.  I was on, like, an on line forum type thing.  I, ah, was posted.
L:  Okay.
R:  Which is how I did but they're -- they're kind of fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- my last call actually was from a guy from Philly.
L:  Okay.
R:  So that was kinda -- kinda weird that, you know, of the -- as many states that two of my calls have been from Pennsylvania.
L:  Yes, that's a little strange.
R:  I can't remember where the third one was from.  But it is hard to stay on topic I think for ten minutes.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Very hard.  And the other bizarre thing is my -- my girlfriend and I, we both signed up together and one of my calls -- actually all three of my calls were from there -- one of my calls was to her.  Now, what is the chance of that? 
L:  Yeah, that seems to be --
R:  We actually were both on -- we were both talking on the phone together and I got the beep in and it was them.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, ah, when they put the other person on it was her and I was just like wow, we laughed half -- half the time.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  We were, like, laughing.  But anyway, ah, I don't really know what else to talk about the Middle East except that it was a good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, you know, I don't know.  Any other suggestions? [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] Um, -- 
R:  I don't know what else they said. I know they said, "Do you ever think there will be rest?" and, ah, I can't remember what they said at the beginning when they told us our topic.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But I do, ah, I do agree with it.
L:  Yeah.  So what, um, what kind of work do you do in Lancaster? 
R:  I work, ah, you know, QBC? 
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  I work, um, in a -- just packing.  I work in a -- not the TV, you know. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Not the TV place but just, ah, packing.  How about you? 
L:  Um, I'm a research assistant.
R:  Oh, wow, this is kind of up your ally.
L:  [LAUGH] Sort of, yeah.
R:  The whole research thing.
L:  Yep.
R:  Are you, ah, married or anything?  You sound young.
L:  No, no, I just graduated University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.  Oh, you're from there, huh?  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  How funny.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah. 
R:  No wonder you know about this thing.
L:  Well, yeah, I mean I didn't -- I didn't hear about it --
R:  Through there, yeah.
L:  -- through, like, the department that I work for but -- 
R:  Right, right.  Oh, that's kind of neat though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of work do you do then?
L:  Um, I work with the Weight and Eating Disorders Programme, it's in the Department of Psychiatry.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  So.
R:  That's great.  Yeah, I thought you sounded younger.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I'm the old married -- I'm the old married one here.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, ah, in fact, my children keep coming and bugging me as I'm on this phone call. [LAUGH]
L:  So do you know how the payment works, like, -- [LAUGH]  
R:  Um, I did this before.  They did this one other time --
