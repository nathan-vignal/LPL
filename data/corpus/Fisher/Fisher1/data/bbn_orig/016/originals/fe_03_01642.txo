L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is my first one so you'll have to bear with me.
R:  Me too, this is my first one also.
L:  Oh, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  So we're both newbies.
L:  My name is Maryanne.
R:  Hi, I'm Kwanisha.
L:  [NOISE] And I'm from Massachusetts.
R:  Um, I'm from New York.  I mean, I'm from New York but I go to school in Pennsylvania.
L:  Good for you.
R:  Thank you.
L:  So, the topic is the Middle East -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you can go ahead.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I guess they asked us if we think that there should be peace in the Middle East or --
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  -- the US should be involved.  And I personally think that we have no place there.  I think that something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that the people sort it out with themselves and that we should learn from history.  And us always getting involved and putting in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- proper governments, usually that don't work out in the long run.  And I really don't think, um -- I think, one, Bush is using this and the whole nine eleven incident as a way to kind of go in there, and I really think it's all about oil or some other reason, some other economic reason.  I don't really think it's for -- I don't think he really cares about the people there and the way the government system is working.  So, I think that we should mind our own business [LAUGH] 'cause no one asked us to be there.  A lot of people are definitely against it and, as you see, there's a lot of antiwar sentiment in the country itself.  [NOISE] So we -- Bush shouldn't act like a tyrant in the first place and we should just really [MN] keep our place in the United States and worry about more domestic problems than anything else.
L:  [MN] You know, I have to tell you, when I heard the topic I was a little concerned because, ah, [MN] I -- I -- I feel exactly as you do.  And I -- I feel that it's -- it's not popular to speak out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about it.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- y- you know, I- I'm probably a little older than you are [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, so I kinda keep my opinions to myself.  When people talk about it I kind just go, "Yeah".  I feel exactly -- I have -- it has to do with Israel, it has to with the oil.  They're not going to find any weapons --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of mass destruction.  He -- he kind has [MN] glossed over that part of it, that we just wanted to take them over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not in -- in -- [MN] there's many other people that a- are tyrants in other countries and he hasn't done a thing about those.
R:  And, like, where's it our place to go around?  Like, this is on it -- the whole globalization issue --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all that.  Like, where is it our place, you know, to go around to other countries?  Like, okay, we don't like your -- your, um, leader so --
L:  Right.
R:  --we're gonna get rid of him.  [LAUGH]
L:  I agree completely.
R:  You know, let's go.
L:  And this is shocking to me.  [LAUGH]
R:  And you know -- and, you know, I understand, like -- like I -- I still wasn't for it but the whole Afghanistan thing and the whole, you know, all that stuff where like, you know, they attacked our country so we want to attack theirs.
L:  Mm.
R:  That, I guess, is easier.  [LIPSMACK] I still don't agree with it but it's easier to, um, I guess --
L:  Right.
R: -- rationalize, like, okay, we're looking for Al Qaeda, we're trying to find, you know, all that stuff and, you know, we're gonna -- we want to get them back, whatever.  Like that, you know.  Like, they took down our Trade Center, [NOISE] they attacked us whatever, like that.  But to go on this kind of global anti --
L:  Right.
R:  -- terrorist.  Like, let's get all the terrorists out -- out of the country.  Like --
L:  Right.
R:  That's not right.  And we also have weapons of mass destruction but I guess --
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  -- we're gonna it for good use and they wouldn't use it for good use.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's like wh- -- like, you know, if -- if anything other countries -- England could be like, "You know what?  We're gonna attack the United States because have global weapons --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they might use it on Iraq and they might destroy that portion of the country, I mean, of the world.  So let's, you know, come and bomb America".  Like --"
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it can work both ways and a lot of times it don't is because, like, [MN] I guess you could say we have more political, um, slash economic power in that sense.  And I -- I think we just wanna bully these smaller nations.  And I -- I think he's just really trying to get, like, payback daddy.  [LAUGH] He'd like --
L:  Oh, I agree with you completely.
R:  -- this or whatever, like that.  I -- it's really --
L:  His father messed it up by not taking him out ten years ago.
R:  Mhm.
L: [NOISE] And now he's gonna -- he's trying to do it.  But they're gonna leave the whole country in turmoil.  There is no one.  They don't have a leader to take it over. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  And then especially with limited media coverage.
L:  Right.
R:  And those kind of things.  Like, Americans really don't see what's going on.  I think it was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- like, what, Vietnam, ah, where you had Life magazine.  And the media really there, like, "Look, look --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- what we're doing to these people".
L:  Yeah.
R:  So there was a outcry, even from our people, like, you know, "We need to stop --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- there's no reason for this, no reason".
L:  Yeah.
R:  But now they're like -- it seems like that's the only part they learned from history, like, "Oh, we can't let the people know what's going on because then, you know, they'll see that we're wrong, they'll see that we're making a mistake and they'll see that there's no reason for this to be occurring".  And they'll, like, you know -- but I think that already there's a lot of antiwar sentiment.  The only thing is I think the more, like -- the people that I see that's really out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there marching are, like, are the college students. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But it -- and, like, I don't think until a lot of adults and people who are in, um, these corporate -- corporations who have, like, I guess you could say a larger public voice come out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and speak against it, nothing's really going to happen.  I mean, a lot of celebrities are speaking out against it but I think they're still trying to disregard them.  It's like, "Oh, they're celebrities, whatever, whatever".  Like --
L:  Like they don't have a voice that they shouldn't, ah, voice their own opinions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everybody should be able to.  Ah, ah, I really don't.  I have to say that because I just -- I don't want to get in- into it with people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, [MN] I was totally against 'em going in.  My future son in law is in the Marines and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] it's kind a  me- messing up my daughter's wedding and, um, [MN] I just wish all these guys could just come home, be with their families and raise their kids and have a happy life.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  And not, ah, try to be the policemen for the world. [MN]
R:  Mhm.  And another thing I believe is that [LIPSMACK] I think the way they set up the whole thing, like, the whole war thing, like the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you either with us or against us.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, that -- that strategy is so f- -- I mean, that just shows how a big bully h- he is.
L:  Right.
R:  It's like there's no -- he's not -- he's leaving no room for, like, a healthy opposition.  Like, 'cause I think no --
L:  Right.
R:  -- matter what you do or not matter, like, what type of leader you are, you always have to understand that there are always going to be -- whether it be a minority or a majority, that there's going to be people who don't agree with you.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  And he's setting it up that whoever doesn't agree they're gonna feel like they're anti-American, like, anti -- they -- oh, like, not antiterrorist but they're pro-terrorist.  And, like --
L:  Right.
R:  All this kind of thing like that.  And, you know, even with all these antiwar rallies and, you know, you have 'em on the East Coast and the West Coast and all the things.  But mostly what [several inaudible word] and the walk in Wa- -- um -- [MN] and the walk in DC, um, he's still like, "Okay, thank you.  I hear your voice but, um, we're still gonna go on with the war".  It's like [LAUGH] -- he- he's like really disregarding, like, the people who are actually out there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- protesting at -- when they're, like, you know, the capital and things like that, he's not really paying attention to us.  And think the thing that really, really disturbed me [LIPSMACK] was I was listening to MPR the day that the first bombing --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and it was like, um, "Yeah, you know, President Bush was inside and he was waving his fist in the air --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- and he's really -- he's really confident about this decision for war".  I'm, like, how could anyone ever say that they're confident about a decision to go to war?
L:  Right.
R:  If anything that should always be a last option after negotiations.  I don't think anyone will ever feel comfortable with going to war.  It should be like, "Okay, I have to do this because there's nothing else to do".
L:  Right.
R:  But I still feel like I really wish that we could have done more.  Like, I wanted -- like, to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to -- even that picture in my head of him going around celebrating this --
L:  Right.
R:  -- means that, you know, y- you don't feel like there's a consequence to this.  Like, millions of people.  I mean, not millions but, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- thousands of men or hundreds are going to die, like, people who belong to this country.  And I think, you know, maybe that's not hitting him because his children are not -- you know, his daughters are not --
L:  His daughters would never go.
R:  You know, it's not his daughters and it's not the congressmen's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, sons and daughters who are probably in college or in occupations where they wouldn't even -- if they were, say, to reinforce the draft that they wouldn't even have to go --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, ah, um, to Iraq or whatever other country he's thinking about going to next, you know.  So, like, really they have this comfort and the security that, you know, they don't have to worry about this.  So they're like, "Okay, yeah, let's go to war".  I'm just like you're war +mongers out there.  They don't see how it affects, you know, people of color, people pov- -- like, people near the poverty line.  'Cause these are people who will -- will either be drafted if there is a draft --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or have to go off to war or +whose only option is military service for, you know, a set income and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- benefits for their family.  And, you know, these are individuals who are going to war.  And I just think, like, no one -- like, those who would think about it, but the people who actually make these decisions and the congressmen, don't really see how it influences maybe the [MN] -- you could say the lower tiers of American --
L:  Right.
R:  -- society --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- economically.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] You can see them, some of them are so young.  And they're -- they're really -- I think they just joined up to try to get an education out of it.
R:  Yeah, yeah, 'cause you get the education from it.
L:  On- once their four years are over.
R:  Yeah, even I, like -- and I go -- like, I go to an Ivy League college.  I go to University of Penn.  I was like [MN] before this -- all this happened, I was like, maybe I should join ROTC.  They'll help me, like, pay for my education.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Because, like, to go to a good college there's the tuition it's forty thousand dollars --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, a year.  And, like, every year the tuition rises and rises --
L:  Of course.
R:  -- and rises due to inflation.  So, like, those little programs like that were, like, you say -- you can say maybe eighteen to twenty four year olds are joining ROTC or going into the reserves just for the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- extra educational benefits.  Like, even some of the health benefits.  They give full medical coverage, dental coverage.
L:  Right.
R:  And your family gets insurance so that if you're married and things like that, so people marry young and those things like that.  So -- but even the POWs that came back, I was like, "Wow, he looks like he's sixteen".  Like -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How did --
L:  They looked like young boys.
R:  Well, I know he's not sixteen, like, so he must be eighteen 'cause you have to be at least eighteen --
L:  Right, you have to be eighteen.
R:  -- to go over to the war.  And I'm just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, "Wow" like -- and I -- and I'm just thinking about, you know, all the homeless people I see in the street.  And, like, not all are veterans but some of them are.  And I'm just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like thinking, like, you know, you ones who are, what, eighteen, like, you've probably seen things that, you know, no one at ho
