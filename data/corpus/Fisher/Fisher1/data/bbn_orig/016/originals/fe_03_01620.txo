R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Rich.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Jen.
L:  Hi, Jen, how are you?
R:  Fine, how are you?  What State are you in?  I like to ask.
L:  I'm in Massachussetts --
R:  Okay [NOISE].
L:  What about you?
R:  Pennsylvania [NOISE].
L:  I see.
R:  Okay, [NOISE] so, for the topic.  God, [NOISE] you can start.
L:  Quite an a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- quite a -- big topic to try to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- talk about.
R:  Right, uh [NOISE].
L:  Um, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we can talk about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whether or not, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll -- we'll ever --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- see peace in that area of the world --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What do you think?
R:  [NOISE] I don't think so at all [LAUGH], um [NOISE].
L:  I don't -- I don't think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so either.
R:  [NOISE] I think it's a lost cause.  I think it was a waste of time in a way [NOISE] to go over there.  I think that -- well, to go over [NOISE] there I think that should've happened, [NOISE] but I think they should've just bombed it and been done with it [SIGH] [NOISE].  In a way I feel [NOISE] -- I would feel bad for, you know, the [NOISE] civilians that don't [NOISE] care either way, but then in another way I wouldn't care [LAUGH].  I don't know, maybe I'm cold.  
L:  No, I understand.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I had mixed feelings about it as well.  I didn't see what could really be achieved and I w- -- I questioned what the motives were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to begin with.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  When they talk about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- these weapons of mass destruction, I don't even know what that is.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Um, and as far as peace in that area, it looks as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to me that even within any country --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there are so many different factions all based on different religion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I don't think they'll ever get along --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- no matter what's done.
R:  Right, I think they should've just [NOISE] -- well, I guess they can't --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- just bomb everything and be done with it 'cause I guess we want their oil [LAUGH] [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  I guess that's a big factor too [NOISE].
L:  I think maybe the -- the press makes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the rest of the world looks at us as going over there for that one reason but I -- I -- I don't have any belief in that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- only because I think the gas prices will just do one thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they'll continue to go up.
R:  Yeah, now somewhere on AOL I saw -- they said that the US only take seventeen percent of oil from 'em anyway.
L:  Yeah, it's n- --
R:  I forget where the majority came from, but --
L:  I think it's Mexico and Canada.
R:  Yeah, I don't remember but I was surprised to see that.  I thought, you know, like ninety percent came from there.  So, that was surprising.
L:  Yeah, it's -- I -- I bet there was a time, you know, a few years ago when that was probably the case but I think after going through a couple of those, um, [MN] shortages that the US were smart to start looking in different areas -- try to get --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that resource.
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know, this -- this peace that they look for in that part of the world, they haven't had it in two thousand years and -- and longer.  Why do they think that it's ever gonna happen now?  I mean, even a few weeks after it looks as if this war has come to somewhat of an ending and they're still fighting amongst themselves about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- how to go about --
R:  I couldn't believe the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- looting I saw on the news.  I thought, "If they want to be, you know, free +liberated --"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- whatever the word was, you know, why are they then hurting themselves by looting their own stuff, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- the government offices, or whatever, you know".  They even went into the Museum.  Did you see that?
L:  Yeah, terrible.
R:  And they took all that stuff and I thought, "Well..." [SIGH].  I don't know.  I just don't understand.  You would think they would want that stuff to stay protected.  
L:  Well, even some people -- even some Iraqis themselves questioning to the newsmen, "Why would our own people do this?"  Well, that's a good question.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I s- -- I bet it had something to do with being so oppressed for so long and so poor that maybe they thought -- I mean, I could see them going into the palaces and grabbing that stuff and feeling as if they --
R:  Right, yeah, I could see that, yeah.
L:  -- but not go into the Museums --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and pillaging them.  That was terrible.
R:  Right, that's their culture, or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you would think they would want that to ... I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  And it could be gone forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, it's really sad, um --
R:  They're probably now selling it on eBay [LAUGH].
L:  [SIGH] That's the truth --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- What isn't [LAUGH].
R:  Right, exactly [LAUGH].
L:  [SIGH] Oh, my, it's unbelievable.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, how many of these have you participated in already?
R:  This is only my second one.
L:  Yeah, it's only my second one as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, they just go on maybe two or three?  Is that -- is -- is three the maximum, or will it just --
R:  Well, initially I thought it was just three the maximum, but then on one of the forums that I belong to, they said there were a few people that said they've gotten, you know, quite a few, like up to ten.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, so maybe they have more times available on their, you know --
L:  I see.  I see.
R:  -- their profile
L:  W- What was your first topic that you had to talk about --
R:  Um.
L:  -- do you remember?
R:  Oh, it was if you wanted to open up your own business, what would it be?
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mine had something to do with, uh, uh, sports figures and how much they get paid and whether they -- whether they should go on strike.  It was kind of a weird conversation and I didn't really know where to take it.
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't know what to say about that either --
L:  And --
R:  -- 'cause I'm not into sports.
L:  -- this one's kinda the same thing.  I mean, you know, peace in the Middle East.  My god, if we had those answers [LAUGH] --
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  -- we'd be in a different job than, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or doing something else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [MN] the -- did -- when this is all done d- d- -- is there any questions that they ask you or anything like that?  Or you just -- they just say, "You can hang up now", or something"
R:  It said, um -- it'll come on --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and say, "You have thirty seconds left to complete your call".
L:  I see.
R:  And then you just say, "Goodbye" and then that's it.
L:  And do you just specify what time of day?  Did you pick two o'clock as the time for th- -- for th- -- for you to get the call?
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in b- -- I think it was like in between two and five or something.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So, then you don't know.  You could get it at any time in between --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- that timeframe.
L:  I see.  And you are paid for this, I hope?
R:  Yeah, did you get your pay check yet?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Okay, my first one I got a check already.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think that I opted out of being paid because I think it has something to do with the company that I work for --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and instead they asked us to waive being paid, but they would put us into a pool --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and maybe select some winners for something or other.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I just thought it would be the right thing to do, um ...  Do the right thing for the company and just get involved.  But, when the phone rings, my first reaction is, "You know, this is a weird phone number, who's calling me?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I hear the topic and I go, "Oh, I just feel like hanging up.  I don't wanna [LAUGH] do this".
R:  I know, that's what I was thinking --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- until they called.  'Cause the first call actually was like two months ago and then I haven't had any since.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, it was really odd.
L:  Huh --
R:  Huh.
L:  Well, I did get a phone call, um, on Friday, so I thought maybe -- and then I forgot all about it today until I looked at the phone number and it dawned on me this had to be the same number.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And as far as talking ten minutes on the subject is concerned, it almost seems like too long a time for strangers to have to talk about something like that.  There's only so much you can say about it.
R:  Right, exactly --
L:  I --
R:  -- I mean, I don't know what else really to say about --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- over there except for -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- oh, one thing would be, why is that, you know, our people that they have, you know, had captured, they were torturing, they've killed, you know, some and yet supposedly -- I mean, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I don't know all of it, but supposedly from what I heard on the news, you know, everybody that we have captured of which -- I think they said over six thousand people from over there --
L:  Mhm.  [MN] That sounds right.
R:  Supposedly, you know, they're going by some kind of guidelines where they're, you know, the US is not abusing these people at all and they're trying to -- they -- they take care of them.  Maybe we're not.  Maybe our people aren't.  I don't know.  I think -- I don't know.
L:  Well, I was surprised to find out that those seven POWs were still alive.  I didn't --
R:  I kn- -- I was too.
L:  -- have any faith.  I just didn't think they would be.
R:  I was very surprised.
L:  I'm very pleased that they were, but I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I didn't -- I didn't expect that.  Yeah, I think in the case of the six thousand prisoners that we have of theirs; they were barely being fed, barely being clothed and the situation that they're in, as long as they remain prisoners, is probably even a better situation that they were in prior to being captured.
R:  Probably, but another thing that irritates me is now our US dollars is gonna feed those six thousand people.
L:  Oh, that's the -- that's the tip of the iceberg.  Do you know how much money it's gonna cost us to rebuild that country?
R:  And that too!  Right, my ten year old daughter keeps saying to me, you know, she listens to the news a little bit and she'll say, "Why are we rebuilding their country?  We just bombed their butts.  Why are we paying --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- to rebuild it?"  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a tough question.
R:  I don't know how to answer her question --
L:  Now, that's the truth.
R:  -- um, I don't know.  I told her to ask her teacher.  Let them think about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's -- that's a good ques- -- that -- put it on them.  They spend a lot more time having to come up with that kind of answer than --
R:  Right, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  It's a tough question to be answering to your children.  No doubt about it.  How many kids do you have?
R:  Three.
L:  Good for you.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Good for you.
R:  You don't have any?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, nephews and nieces, but -- but no -- no children of our own.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'm getting a little long in the tooth, a little long in years at this point, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I suspect that I'll stay that way and if wanna see kids I either go to my nieces and nephews or -- or I visit some friends and I say, "Yeah, that's why I don't want kids.  Now I remember" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, golly, yeah, that's --
L:  That's not really true, but --
R:  -- the truth.  Oh, boy.
L:  -- there's some truth to it.
R:  Yeah, there is a lot of truth to it.  The kids they -- oh god, they run through the house and they trash the house and they -- oh, geez.
L:  That's the truth.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
L:  Well, it's nice talking to you.  I suspect that, um --
R:  Well it should go -- but if -- if y- --
L:  -- any second now they should probably --
R:  Yeah, any second it should be.
L:  -- should be kicking in.  So, it looks as if they must put some sort of a timer on it and then it comes on and tells us you have X number of seconds just to end the phone call, or something.
R:  Yeah, 'cause a r- -- a recording will come on.
L:  I see, I see.  Um, were you watching CNN during this -- this time when the -- when the war was on, or were you trying to avoid it as much as you could?
R:  I was watching it as much as I could.
L:  I see.
R:  You know, as much as possible.  I actually -- I don't know -- I actually wanted to, you know, see -- you know what I mean?  A lot -- even now like I have CNN on a lot and my husband's like, "Why do you keep putting that on.  Who cares?"  Not like who cares, but he's just getting so -- you know, there's just so much information ...
