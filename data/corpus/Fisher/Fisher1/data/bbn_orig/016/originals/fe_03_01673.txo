R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Sharlene.
L:  I'm Rick.
R:  Hi, Rick.  All right, so, ah, what do you think of, ah, Middle East issues?
L:  Ah [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, I just -- this is like the first one I'm doing so it s- seems a little weird.
R:  Oh, okay, it's my first one too. [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This is very strange but, hey. [LAUGH]
L:  Um.
R:  Are you, ah, into politics at all?
L:  Ye- yeah.
R:  You follow 'em in general?  Okay.  Um, interesting.  Um, well, mm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a little awkward. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I- th- you feel weird trying to be the one, you know -- you don't want to be the one to g- start first but at some point someone's going to have to. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  That's true.  Um, well, um, I'm a anti war person in general.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I guess I'll say that [NOISE] off the bat.  I don't like conflict.  Um, and I think in general that, um, I don't know, we should go through more peaceful means of getting things done.
L:  [MN] Well, that -- that also presumes that your opponent also wants that same strategy.  If that's not the case, if they aren't willing to go through peaceful means, then really peaceful means won't work.
R:  Very true.  [LAUGH] Very, very true, can't dispute that.  Um, [SIGH] but, I don't know.  I'm also for, um, heavy procedure eve- -- like, I like procedural things.  I think that if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  If, mm, maybe [SIGH] -- well, again you can also say that, ah, a lot of UN strategy was pretty much ineffective, so you can criticize it and say that procedural matters weren't -- procedural means weren't.
L:  [MN] Well, see, once again it comes down to procedural means, you know, have a worth if the parties, you know, concede to the substantive part.
R:  [LIPSMACK] True.
L:  Um, if they don't concede to the sub- substantive part then you could have all the procedure in the world, it won't change things.
R:  Mm.
L:  Ah, that's -- you know, that's the regrettable thing.
R:  Right.  I guess you will just have to decide at that point whether, um, your departing from procedure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is -- well, whether in your departing procedure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:   -- um, you in yourself are doing an evil --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just by doing that and if that evil is greater or less than what you want to curtail, so ...
L:  And tha- that's pretty much how, you know, the application of force always is.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, you know, [MN] well, at least from the perspective, I guess, of the western ideal is that i- it is seen as a last resort.  But where people differ is, you know, when does that last resort start.
R:  Right.  [NOISE] So, um, [NOISE] I don't -- mm, I haven't been completely abreast of everything that's been go- -- I -- like I didn't follow it until like pr- probably, mm, when my mom said -- when I called my mom to find out that, um, ah, statues were being brought down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so and so forth.  So that's when I kinda, ah, looked in and see -- to, ah, really see what was going on on TV.  Um, but, um, I don't know if I, ah -- I ca- -- [MN] how familiar are -- [MN] how familiar are you with how much support the US got for its initiative?
L:  Um, it certainly got a lot more than was portrayed in the press.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Ah, well definitely I know Britain.  Um, Canada, I'm not sure of even though I'm Canadian.  I should now. [LAUGH]
L:  Well Ca- Canada is interesting because when you -- if you go outside of Montreal --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or Quebec, the majority of Canadians of support it.  It's just that Quebec is so adamantly opposed --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that the polls would actually show Canada was being more opposed to action --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- than not.
R:  But it reflects basically Quebec?
L:  Yeah, it reflects basically the differences in Canada itself.
R:  Right.  Um, course I'm a Quebecer.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  [LAUGH] Okay, okay.  I wasn't too sure that you --
L:  Um, yeah, there was something like -- there were over forty some nations that supported the US in this.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and, you know, the two big ones bei- -- well, the three big ones being --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] ah, Britain, Australia and Japan.  And Japan's even more interesting because they've, um, as a country they're the only country in the world that's basically, um, has given up its sovereign right to protect itself.
R:  Right, okay, right.
L:  So that -- that makes their position in this very interesting.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.  Um, what was I gonna say?  Ah, what was w- what -- what were one of the other little prompts that the ...?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I -- I think there was just this vague thing about, like, peace in the Middle East so, you know, I -- I'm guessing they're seeing where people go with that.
R:  Right, right.  Um, what do you think about, um, possibility right now for, like, them to actually implement a stable regime and how long it's gonna take and ...?
L:  I think it's possible but it's gonna take, you know, a few years.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And, you know, we have to go through with that.
R:  Hm.  I d- I also think, um, I don't know.  I feel like, ah, it's more effective wh- if, ah, a country within itself actually overthrows an unpopular regime.
L:  Well, I -- I would point to the two probably most successful changes in the, you know, in the past hundred years have actually been in Germany and Japan.
R:  Germany and Japan.
L:  And in those cases they were, ah --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, those were changes forced from the outside.
R:  Mm, that's true.  [LAUGH] That is true.  Mm, I don't know.  Um, also I'm trying to, like, gauge how much actual -- how much, ah, of the country itself was anti Saddam.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  That's -- that's a hard guess, um, and --
R:  A very hard guess.
L:  -- I -- I think i- if anything these are where the tribal differences are coming in because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it really seemed to be his power base was limited to his tribe.
R:  Okay.
L:  And as the farther out you get from that, you know, the more hostile --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you got.  I mean, the- there --
R:  Obviously Kurds and Sunnis and not going to be ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, the real big question is whether or not, you know, to get a good stable regime in the area we really should try and keep it as Iraq or, you know, be willing to break it up into smaller nations.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  Um, you know.  I per- I personally would love to see a Kurdistan, but that would really tick off a lot of the neighboring nations. [LAUGH]
R:  Kurdistan, okay.  Um, wait, are the Kurds in the north and the Sunnis in the south or vice?
L:  The Kurds are in the north, the Sunnis are in the south --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the Shiites sort of, I guess, have that middle band.
R:  Okay.  Hm, interesting.  Um, let me see, what else do I have to say on the subject?  Um, [MN] so you do think, ah, there is a very good possibility for a peaceful regime to be set up, just it's gonna take a while?
L:  [MN] Yeah.  I mean, like anything it's gonna take time because, you know, you can't just have a democratic regime overnight.  You need to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sort of build up the infrastructure of democracy.  You have to be able to -- you know, they have to get used to having a completely free press, which is going to be something completely new for the region.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, they have to get used to, you know, political dissent.  They have to get used to a lot of things.  And, you know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- if that happens ...
R:  [MN] Also another thing is when, ah, when you kind of go into another country and try to set stuff up, h- like, what model or what specific type of democracy is going to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- implemented there?  Like who decides all that?  Like is it, like, ah, gonna be kinda --
L:  [MN] 
R:  'Cause I feel -- like, there was a guy speaking, I think he was -- he was educated here, I think MIT if I'm correct, I'm not even sure.  And, um, he had left Iraq way back when and just, ah, went back and, um, I feel like I don't know if him and his group of people are going to be involved with, like, Americans to try to ...
L:  [MN] It i- -- I mean, it can go all over the place, um, you know.  I mean, following World War Two in Japan it was basically everything was decided by the US with the sort of rubber stamp approval of the Japanese.
R:  Right, okay.
L:  Um, you know, presumably this one will be a little bit different where it's going to be, you know, feedback from all sides.  And, you know, we really are a part of that so we're probably going to have some input.  But I would expect that a lot of it will be guided, or they will try and make it as soon as possible guided by Iraqis themselves.
R:  [NOISE] Right. [MN]

L:  Um.  [MN] [PAUSE] But, yeah, th- you know, these are the nitty gritty questions, you know.  And [NOISE] honestly, I hope they try and avoid a parliamentary system.  I hope they try and go for more of a federal republic system that we have here because that seems to be a good way to counterbalance the tensions that you might have because of ethnic differences.
R:  Okay.  Hm, yeah.  [PAUSE] Hm.  Trying to think of what else I want to say. [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or ask.  Um, oh, can I ask what, um, major you are or what do you do, or whatever?
L:  Well, my background is I have an advanced degree in mathematics and I'm currently in law school.
R:  [MN] Oh, okay, okay.  Interesting, all right.
L:  And what about you on this?
R:  Um, politics, philosophy and economics, P.P.E. person. [MN] 
L:  P -- what's the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You said politics and then?
R:  Philosophy and economics.
L:  Okay.
R:  With a concentration in economics, so ...
L:  Okay.  Well, yeah, I mean --
R:  And looking to go to law school.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I haven't heard from everybody yet so [inaudible].
L:  Ah, where have you heard from?
R:  I've been waitlisted at Northwestern and Emery.
L:  You don't want to go to Northwestern.
R:  I don't?  Ah, what do you have to say about that.
L:  Ah, I -- I know a psycho person there. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] May I ask where you are now?
L:  I'm at Penn.
R:  Oh, you're at Penn Law School, okay.  Oh, I did apply to them but I feel like they took so many people last year --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if I haven't heard from them now I'm probably going to be, at best, waitlisted.
L:  Don't worry about it 'cause one of the things Penn's doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is they have hold priorities.
R:  Okay.
L:  Which basically means they -- yes, they accepted way more than they did las- -- you know, than they -- they needed last year and so they kinda got screwed over with that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Everyone did in our financial aide.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, oh, the two [inaudible] next year are going to have a tough time looking for jobs, trust me on that. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, now the thing is though
