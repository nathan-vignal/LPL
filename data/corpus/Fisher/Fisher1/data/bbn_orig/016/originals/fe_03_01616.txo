R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, ah, my name's Hunter Provin[?].
L:  Hi, my name is Rita.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I'm good, I'm in Florida.  Where are you? 
R:  I'm in, ah, Columbia, Maryland.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ... 
R:  Have you done any of these before?
L:  No, I haven't, have you?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  It's my first one.
R:  It seems pretty straightforward.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] We got a hard topic though.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What -- do you know what, it's a very conflicting topic for people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, a lot of people are not happy with us being over there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  I have a problem with Americans being for or against it.  But I don't know, I think we should chop away France for their disagreements with us. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, what do you think we can do?
L:  Huh?
R:  What do you think we could do with them?  
L:  France, ah, I don't really -- don't know, um, because -- not -- not buy their products, that's -- that's the big thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's why they're pretty much being quiet now because Americans were not buying their products, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they lose money.  There's not a lot you can do with France though, it's not like a small country where you supply so much aid.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, I think it's, ah, -- I think it's, ah, too bad that, um, that a lot of these European countries seems like they're -- their judgment is clouded by personal feelings of feeling, um, inadequate because the United States has a aggressive foreign policy and it makes them -- it makes them feel sensitive that they're not as strong I think.  I mean, I think that's what's most of it stems from, most of their opposition.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  And I think it's -- it's hard for them.  I mean, obviously we have some sort of interest in trying to protect ourselves, um, by going into Iraq and it's obvious that our main interests isn't just 'cause we want to save people but I think that -- that, ah, anybody who's looking at it objectively would have to agree that it will be for the better of the Iraqi people in the long run I think.
L:  I think so too.  I think it's amazing to see Iraqi people just even demonstrating on television.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You don't see that on any, you know, in -- in -- in Iraq, in Syria, in none of the places do you see people demonstrating.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They'd be shot and I think that's -- I think that right there is -- justifies what, you know, us being there and taking over like that.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  You know, I just think that justifies it because I think everybody has the right to -- to protest.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  So I -- I think that -- I think that's good.  Um, I hope we don't stay there much longer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I hope they set up a government and we get out of there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I do believe that the longer we're there, the longer the other Arab nations won't tolerate us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which could cause a -- a lot of trouble for us I think.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.  Yeah, I'm sure that there's a lot of [COUGH] -- I'm sure there's a lot of politicians and clerics in Iraq that are hoping to get -- hoping to -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, um, ride a popular wave of anti Americanism to -- to power --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and hopefully if we get out of there quick enough, then that won't happen.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I'm sure they're all ready, like a lot of 'em are just -- they're already giving, ah, giving sermons about trying to rile people up.
L:  Yeah. I don't like the -- what goes on with the soldiers.  I mean, I, you know, I hate the suicide bombers and they think they're brave.  I think they're cowards, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't have enough nerve to face our -- our boys one on -- one on one with guns.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They are going to try ways to trick 'em and I just -- I have two brothers who are over there right now.
R:  Oh, they're still there?
L:  Yeah.  They're over there right -- yeah, they're over there now.
R:  How long were -- had they have been there?
L:  One's in the marines, one's in the air force.  Um, well, the marine has been out there since, oh, my gosh, like three weeks before it started.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my brother in the air force, about three or four days before it started.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  He's a flier so ... 
R:  How much longer could it be that they have to stay?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I think my brother in the air force will be coming home sooner than the one in the marines.  The one in the marines, he just -- they dismantle landmines and stuff so -- and stuff like that and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- clear the area of -- of dangerous materials and stuff like that so I think they'll be there a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, and then I don't know, I -- I have a feeling that this isn't quite all -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't think they're -- they're quite done.  I got, you know, unless Syria starts listening to us, ah, we may be going into their back door now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just kind of have that feeling. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, I heard them talking about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that -- 
L:  So maybe that's why they haven't declared victory yet.
R:  What kind of government do they have?  
L:  Syria?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, their -- their president -- he just -- it's hard to -- it's kind of -- it's a dictatorship.  His father was horrible.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The one in charge now they really don't know a lot about him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, he's -- he was -- you know, pretty close with Iraq and the other na- Arab nations but also had a lot of ties with our government and the French government too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And Russia and everybody. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So it's really hard to tell, you know, where their loyalties lie.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I think they're defiant against us anyway in th- -- You see, even with the Iraqi people, I know they're glad that, you know, we got rid of Saddam Hussein for 'em, but they don't want us there, you can see that.
R:  Mhm. They'd feel better.
L:  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
R:  What about, ah, -- what about Afghanistan?  I heard that it's getting -- it's still, like, pretty dangerous?
L:  Yeah, I saw that last -- on -- last night on Fox news that some of the, like, suicide bombers are -- are trying to attack soldiers there and, but maybe that's just remnants of what's been going on in Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I think for the most part Afghanistan -- I think the Afghan- Afghanistan people are much more happy with what -- the change in their government and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Than what's going on with Iraq right now.  I don't know if they really have any particular group of people that really want to run Iraq. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lot of them want to but I don't know if they -- if much of 'em know what it's like, especially to have a democratic society.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I think that's the big i- -- the big thing there.
R:  But at least they have a lot of, ah, cities, people live in cities.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they're used to that and -- and they're not as poor as Afghanistan, or as totally destroyed.
L:  Yeah, [PAUSE] yeah.  But they -- they're not quite -- they're not as -- as poor as Afghanistan.  I think that, um, Iraq, if they do build a democratic society, it will be a very rich country with all the oil.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, if -- if the money that the country makes, I mean, actually benefits the people there, it will be a very rich country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- 
R:  It definitely has a lot of potential.
L:  Yeah, it does.  I just hope we're careful about who we put in -- in charge there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, because, I mean, Hussein was there because we put -- made the blessing of him being there when he first took over too.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, back, you know, if we had only known. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- 
R:  It seemed like a good idea at the time.
L:  Exactly.  [PAUSE] Ah, I guess there's a lot over there to control, a lot of billions and billions of dollars coming in for the oil, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  These people become greedy, they have a lot of ulterior motives.
R:  Mhm.
