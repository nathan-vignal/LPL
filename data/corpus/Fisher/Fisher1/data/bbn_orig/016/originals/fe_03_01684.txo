R:  Hello.
L:  Hi [LAUGH].
R:  Hi.
L:  Uh, my name's Teresa.  I'm in -- in Virginia.
R:  My name is Gail, I'm in Mississippi.
L:  Oh.  Have you done calls before?
R:  Uh, this is my second one.
L:  This is my second.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess maybe they started it up again and changed the rules a little bit.
R:  Oh, I'm assuming they did, because I got the email a few days ago and I'm, like, "Yes!"
L:  Yeah, I did too.
R:  [SIGH] I was so happy.
L:  You don't have to remember your PIN number. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I have no idea what my PIN is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I was doing, [inaudible] look to see if like, could find it.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Well, I guess we're supposed to talk about the Middle East, huh?
R:  Uh-huh, that's what she said it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH] Okay, well, I'll [SIGH] I really don't know what my opinion is.  I'm not too sure about the situation over there.
L:  Yeah, I don't know either.  I -- I know I feel bad for those poor people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, what they've lived under and what torture they've gone through and oppression, you know?
R:  I know it, and it's just, oh, I -- I could not imagine living in a situation like that.
L:  Oh, I can't either.  And, yeah, th- just the stories that keep coming out about the torture chambers and murders and, ugh! [SIGH]  Oh, I guess my overall opinion would be then that they -- they've got to be better off down the line, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- can't be any worse.
R:  Uh, I have to agree with you.  I mean, it -- it definitely can't be no worse unless they do get someone worse than Saddam, which hopefully that will not happen.
L:  Yeah, let's hope.  Because it looks like new supplies are getting in, so they're at least getting food and water and 
R:  Right.
L:  Which they didn't even have before.
R:  I know, I had been keeping up with a lot on the news but the last couple of weeks it was like, oh, it's the same thing every day, I'm tired of watching it.
L:  Yeah, sometimes it's too much.  But my husband told me today there was a story that they found a stash of -- I don't even know, like, sixty million or some -- American dollars.
R:  Oh, I hadn't heard anything about that.
L:  No, I hadn't heard.  He said it was all, you know, bundled up and it was all US currency.
R:  Well, I -- if I'm not mistaken, I'd heard on the news the other day they were going to, uh, ship plane loads of cash over there for them.
L:  Oh, I didn't hear that.
R:  And then again, I could be wrong, which would be a real good possibility.  I'm a stay at home mom with two kids so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's a lot I hear and then by the time I think about it again, it's only half of what I thought it was. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know what you mean.  And sometimes it's just too much information.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you just have to change the subject. [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah, I hadn't heard that though.  I g- -- I don't know how they're going establish, you know, currency and a new government and police, [MN].
R:  It's, uh, and then with all the looting going on over there.
L:  Oh yeah, that's just -- that's crazy.  But, you know, but they do it here when they have riots, they tear up their own stores and cities, y- you know, like in LA and things.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] But, you know, they're destroying their own culture, their -- [SIGH] they've destroyed all the shops and [SIGH] I just don't understand why [SIGH] they went that crazy. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, in a way, I suppose I could.  I mean, under -- after what they've been through, and I mean, not even being able to do anything without  someone coming down on you.  I mean, in a way, I guess I could understand that.
L:  Okay, I can understand destroying, you know, the government building --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the palaces and things.
R:  They're probably so happy for the freedom, they're not even worried about the long term effect of it.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  But that's just my opinion too, so [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And you know what they say about opinions.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's one of my favorite sayings. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, I don't know.  What else did it say?  Um, will there ever be peace?
R:  Uh, yeah, and so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I think she said something about the US being over there.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, I think somebody had to do it, and I still think they're going to find w- weapons of mass destruction somewhere.
R:  Mm.  And I -- I -- I honestly think they'll find Saddam eventually.  I don't think he's dead.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I'm just -- I'm torn.  Some of these pictures you see of, uh, it's not him, you know?
R:  Oh, and some of them are so obvious.
L:  Mhm.  Like a whole extra chin on the one guy and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?
R:  Well, it is just so obvious it isn't him.
L:  But I think he was a chicken and he got out.
R:  I would.  I would get -- I would run.  I would put my tail between my legs and take off.
L:  Course I hate the idea that, uh, some other country, Syria maybe, is harboring him.
R:  Mm, that's true too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I did hear on the news today that Syria was cooperating.
L:  Well.
R:  [SIGH] But I don't know how much truth there is to it.
L:  Iraq said they were cooperating too.
R:  Sure, I know.
L:  [LAUGH] And it's unbelievable seeing these mansions that he had, and yet his people are starving to death, and look what he does.  And then they found like, all the children's supplies, and the Unicef supplies in the son's palace.
R:  Oh, I hadn't heard that.
L:  Yeah, it was last week one day.  One of his sons, they found all kinds of school supplies for children --
R:  [SIGH].
L:  -- Unicef packages.  So, he didn't even give things to the kids.
R:  I mean, that's -- that's just wrong.
L:  [SIGH] This -- this is the son that had all the pictures of the naked women.
R:  What-- what their name, Uday and something else?
L:  Yeah, I don't remember the other one's name.
R:  Me neither.  And the only reason I can remember that one's name is because they were talking about how mean he was and everything.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, there was an article on the guy who was kidnapped to be his double, and they threatened to kill his sister and mother or something if he didn't do it.
R:  And I'm sure they would not have h- have hesitated one second to do it.
L:  Oh, I'm sure, huh.  But I just [SIGH] well, I guess, you know, I just wish there were more countries behind us, but I'm glad Britain is.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I was --
L:  Tony Blair seems like a cool guy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But -- 'cause I'm really surprised that Britain did come behind us.  I figured they wouldn't, and I figured maybe France would.  But, I'm glad it's Great Britain instead of France.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Tell Daddy I'm on the phone doing a survey. [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH] [SIGH]  Um 
R:  Uh, my husband, [NOISE] he hates me being on the computer. 
L:  Oh, mine too, I'm always on there.
R:  He hates me being on the phone, but whenever he sees me getting those little checks in, he don't say too much.
L:  Well, that's right.  Yeah, all the, you know, points programs and things like that?
R:  Mhm.  Exactly, 'cause, uh, m- [SIGH] I know I'm getting off the subject, but my husband is, like, "You're always on the computer", but look what I can get, I mean I've got tons of stuff from --
L:  Yeah, me too. [COUGH]
R:  -- being on here, from contests and stuff, and he's finally realising that she's not just wasting all her time on the computer.
L:  Right.  Yeah, mine likes when we get to the Home Depot and it's like, "Look, I got a free gift certificate for Andy though". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, I've looked at -- I've got [SIGH] mouse and keyboard combo.  I've got all kind of different -- full size of make up, uh, things from contests and all, and he's, like, "Where are you getting that stuff from?"  "The computer".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I have about thirty dollars worth of survey checks in my purse now, but 
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  [SIGH] I'm just saving them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know I'll need the money eventually.
L:  I been trying to find more survey sites.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, yeah, I don't know if they want us to stay on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess they do want us to stay on the subject! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh well, the first time I done it, uh, we changed subjects a lot, me and the guy I was talking to the first time.
L:  Yeah, the woman I had the first time, we did too, because she is in a town near where I grew up in Pennsylvania, [LAUGH] so we were talking about [LAUGH] stuff from there [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then we started talking about all the different points programs and which ones she does and which ones I do and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well, if I had your email address, I could send you a long list of survey sites.
L:  Oh, well, that would be great, if you wouldn't mind.
R:  Okay, that'd work.
L:  Okay, it's T. --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for Theresa and McRoberts, M.C. Roberts.
R:  Okay, what is it again?
L:  M.C.
R:  M.C.
L:  Mhm. R.O.B. --
R:  Ro- --
L:  -- E.R.T.S.
R:  Okay.
L:  At AOL
R:  T.M.C.?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At what?
L:  aol dot com.
R:  Okay.  Okay, I'll get that out to you.  It will come from honeybear three nine four two nine at yahoo.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, whenever you see it, don't worry about it, it's not a strange email, I promise.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I delete a lot of stuff if I don't who it's from, and -- do you post on big big forms?
R:  B- BBS?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  Okay, 'cause I've seen honeybear posts on there.
R:  Yeah, do you post on there?
L:  [SIGH] I look at it sometimes, I just haven't registered yet.
R:  Yes, oh, I'm the same --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with honeybear.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Oh, I've got recognition, oh. [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  I know your name now.
R:  Oh, this is so cool. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I keep saying I'm going to register, just --
R:  Oh, you should, it's worth -- it's fun.
L:  Yes.
R:  I've been a member a little over two years, but I really just starting posting in October. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, yeah --
L:  Yeah, I see your name on there a lot.
R:  -- it's tons of fun.
L:  Well, that'll be cool, now I'll know somebody's name. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, yep, it'll be me. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I'll have to figure out a name for on there.  Most of the time I'm just -- you're so rushed and doing programming stuff and then I don't have any more time, you know? [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  But, yeah, I'm [SIGH] I'm a BBS addict.  I am so hooked on it.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's great.  It looks like we only have one more minute, so what can we talk about?
R:  Oh, let me see.  We've covered the war, we've covered [inaudible] --
L:  Well, I'm glad that the POWs were rescued --
R:  Yeah, so am I.
L:  -- certainly.  That was so nice to have good news.
R:  I know.
L:  [MN] You know, I was just looking at the paper today, they have a tribute and they have a picture, the hundred and fifty eight that have been killed as of Sunday.
R:  Oh.  I think there's been two or three from Mississippi killed, not very many, but I mean --
L:  Yeah, any are --
R:  -- that -- that's still too many.
L:  Right.  I looked -- because I'm originally from Pennsylvania and there are five or six from Pennsylvania, and, uh, I believe only one or two from Virginia now, couple from Maryland.
R:  Makes you sad. 
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  And I'm lucky enough not to have anyone close over there.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, knock on wood, I don't know anyone either.
R:  And I have a friend who is in the National Guard, but he didn't --
