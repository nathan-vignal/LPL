L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, hi.
L:  Hi.  My name's Crystal.
R:  Um, my name's Manny --
L:  Hi.
R:  Nice to meet you [NOISE].  I think we're supposed to talk about, um -- what is it, airport security?
L:  If -- if we think heightened airport security is -- lessens the threat of terrorism.
R:  Oh, what do you think?
L:  Uh, I guess so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  Usually -- I used to hear the topic beforehand --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then I could decide if I wanted to stay on the line, but -- so, oh my gosh, I don't know [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What do you think?
R:  Um, well, I mean, I guess it does a little bit.  Um, I mean, it's -- it's l- more than --more than it does that it kinda like prevents people from trying.  It's sorta like, uh -- the way I see it I guess it's sorta like a gated community.  Like, I mean, the gate doesn't really stop you from, you know --
L:  But it's kind of a hindrance.
R:  -- getting into the community.  What's that?
L:  I said, "But it's kind of a hindrance".
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I guess that's the way I see it.  I mean, I think more can be done and I think it's still pretty easily -- I think somebody can easily still, you know, carry a bomb onto an airplane and proceed with it, but, I mean, I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  But, you know, they didn't carry a bomb on the n- -- on the nine eleven thing.
R:  Yeah, they didn't, so you mean it doesn't even take --
L:  You know, they used the plane as a bomb.
R:  Yeah, so it doesn't even take that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I guess it helps a little bit but there's still a long way to go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, it -- I guess it's a step in the right direction.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what else do we say, huh?
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's a pretty short topic.  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  I know, like th- that's a tough one, um, huh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, --
L:  Um --
R:  -- that's great.
L:  Uh --
R:  Yeah, so when was the last time you flew?
L:  Last time I flew was probably about maybe three years ago, four years ago.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so I haven't had --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- to fly or anything like that since then.
R:  No, I flew out of the country like recently, like about last December.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and they didn't really give me any trouble.  I didn't see any different and, um -- the way the treated anybody, um --
L:  What was security like?  Did they like search you and search all your stuff, or ...
R:  No, they didn't.  They just put me through the regular thing and we were done.
L:  That was it?
R:  Yeah, they sear- -- I think they randomly select different people and, uh, asked them to like, you know, put their hands up and, you know, search -- searched them thoroughly, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but until they like random people, they don't do everybody or anything like that 'cause they don't have time to.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  So, I mean, if you don't get randomly picked and if you're a terrorist I guess you can still get away with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  I guess maybe they go by gender, like -- like profiling kind of like.
R:  Yeah, I think they do racial profiling, um, but I guess they have to.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  Um, so, uh, is this your first time doing this, or what?
L:  No, this'll be my third one.
R:  Oh, really?  Okay.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  No, this is --
L:  Yeah, a couple of days ago we had to talk about how the nine eleven thing has, uh, affected how you, like look at life, like --
R:  Yeah, that's what I talked about last time too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  This is my second time doing it, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was a little easier topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess it was a little bit easier.  [SIGH]
L:  You just kinda make it up as you go along.
R:  Yeah.  This ones just -- I don't know, it just seems like a yes or no kinda answer.  There's not much to it.  Yes, it does help a little bit and that's the end of the story.
L:  Yeah, every -- every little bit helps, but --
R:  Yeah, but I don't really know how to expand on that too much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  Kinda stuck.  I mean I know that like airplane security would be like a big thing because of what happened at nine eleven but I -- I don't know, but with my imagination I think of like all these other possibilities that they could do --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- like -- like a terroristic threat.  You know, like blowing up a major dam or something.  
R:  Yeah, they can -- there's a lot of things that they can do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not only that, like the airplane companies are, you know, like losing a lot of money 'cause --
L:  Yeah, they're like almost going bankrupt.
R:  -- it's expensive to do all this stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know if there is -- I mean, I don't know if it's worth it for the -- I'm sure the companies are suffering a lot because of all the extra added protec- protection or surveillance, or whatever.
L:  I -- I saw a thing on -- on something on like one of those like twenty twenty or forty eight hours programme the other day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they were talking about how like -- I guess in another country -- I forget where.  I wasn't paying that -- that sort of attention, I guess.  But in another country they were having like, um, some of their planes equipped with these like, um, bomb detecting laser thingies --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and 'cause the bombs are kinda like heat seeking or -- or whatever, and they would seek out the plane and follow it and they had these like laser things on the bottom of the plane and it would detect this, uh -- a bomb or something and it would like throw a laser beam at it and that would throw off the targeting device of the bomb.  So, the --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- so the plane wouldn't get hit.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  And I thought -- but they were talking about how, you know, it would cost like so many millions of dollars.  It would cost like a couple of million dollars per plane.  
R:  Oh, well see that's not even --
L:  To do this.
R:  -- worth it 'cause, I mean, how many times has a plane been bombed with like a --
L:  Yeah, how many times is a plane itself a target?  I mean, like the nine eleven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thing.  The plane was the bomb.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  So, I g- -- I don't know if that's worth it.  [COUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah that -- 
R:  I think -- I think any way out of it is really expensive.
L:  -- that seems a bit -- a bit expensive for what it's worth.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, there's no way of like r- measuring the w- worth of the lives that would be lost, but then, I mean, some of the -- some of the ways to protect yourself is just not worth it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just not gonna have much of an impact, so ...  I don't know, um -- they want[?] let you talk for like ten minutes, right?
L:  Yeah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- yeah, a thing will come on and tell us.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right [COUGH].  Where are you -- where are you t- -- where are you calling from?  
L:  I'm in Fallbrook, California.
R:  Oh, okay, I'm in Texas.
L:  Oh, really?  Where abouts?
R:  Uh, Austin, Texas.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  Uh, do you like it over there in California?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's pretty good [NOISE].  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Huh.  Well, yeah, I guess the answer's, yeah, and, huh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't really know what to say.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I just found out now that you can't actually use, uh, call waiting, like while you're on the phone.  I think the last time I did it --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- I had to use call waiting.  Yeah, so I guess that voids my call from the last time.
L:  Oh, yeah, you can't -- yeah, it's gotta be like the full ten minutes or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or you're out.  [LAUGH]
R:  Great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I wasn't aware of that, but I just read the rules today and I don't know -- and every time they usually call, they called like the most inconvenient times for me, so --
L:  Yeah, that's why I put down like from ten to twelve, because then I know that there's only a two hour period they're gonna call me.
R:  Oh, see I left a lot of places open.
L:  A lot of -- yeah, I -- I thought about that and I thought, "No, I don't want 'em calling any old time", then that way I know that  -- between ten and twelve they're gonna call me.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that's the best thing.
R:  That's probably a better idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I should've done it like that.  Did you refer a lot of people and stuff, or what?
L:  No, huh-uh.
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] refer a lot of people.  I know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of people that actually do this.
L:  So, do you have their website address?  For the --
R:  Do I have their webs- -- um, yeah, I do.  It's, um --
L:  'Cause I -- I deleted that mail I got and I totally forgot what it was.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, let's see, let me go to my computer real quick and try --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to bring 'em back up.
L:  Okay, hurry --
R:  Um --
L:  -- we're almost out of time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay [LAUGH].  All right, just if I can ...  So, is there anything else you wanna put in for this airport security thing?
L:  Uh, no, not really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- actually I think like the best security they could have would be like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more, like security security.  You know, like physical people security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like -- like having police officers, or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, just people scoping out what people are doing --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I think would be the best kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- security.  
R:  Okay, I'm, uh, looking at the thing.  It has the email address -- has the email address and, uh --
L:  So, I wanna find out --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- when and how we get paid.
R:  Oh, well I guess you can, um, email them and ask them and think they'll reply.
L:  Okay, what is it?
R:  It's D.A.
L:  D.A.
R:  M.I.
