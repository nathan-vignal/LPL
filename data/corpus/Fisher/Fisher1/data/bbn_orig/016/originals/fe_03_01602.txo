L:  Hi, I'm Pamela in Atlanta.
R:  Hi, I'm Lisa in New Jersey.
L:  Hi.  I didn't -- wasn't paid for my last one of these.  Were you by chance?
R:  My first one was only a few days ago, so I don't know.  This is --
L:  Yeah, it's been a couple of months --
R:  -- only my second time. 
L:  I don't know what their deal is.  I think heigh- -- I think airport security's, um, being heightened has helped us because I think it puts terrorists thinking that [NOISE] we're double checking a little bit more and makes them a little more paranoid. [NOISE] It can't hurt in my opinion.
R:  Well, I -- I think it's helped a little bit, but I don't think that it's gonna prevent terrorism.
L:  Me either. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, no, I still think there's gonna be ways for them to get stuff on a plane, or --
L:  Especially now they know what we do. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they probably know everything we do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and how we do it and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know what?  I don't think there could ever be enough --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- security to prevent that.
L:  Yeah, back in nineteen fifty seven was when the Israelis ended up putting the -- the armored, um, people there -- two armored guards behind a bulletproof door and then there's another door past them to the pilot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they've never been hijacked [NOISE], so I don't know I guess it's [NOISE] -- we should've been kinda following their lead --
R:  We defin- --
L:  -- since we're allies. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, the doors to the -- to the cockpit should definitely be bulletproof and not be -- nobody be able to get in.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'm so glad on TV today [NOISE] they said something about them having [NOISE] -- the pilots being armed now.  I think that's great. [NOISE]
R:  Yes, I was just reading that on the computer.
L:  Were you?
R:  They're gonna have guns.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and they're ex military most of them anyway, so I'm hoping that'll help because, you know, that's kinda what prevented 'em before [NOISE] from -- they were killed and stuff 'cause they weren't allowed to have a gun.  I have a friend that's a pilot.  He told me that most of 'em are ex military anyway, so they know how to use a gun.  They're not just gonna randomly shoot through the plane.  I mean, they don't want to kill anybody, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- so, I don't understand why they didn't let 'em have it before, but that's all really heightened, I guess with the -- the level of the airport --
R:  Yeah, but you know what?  If those doors aren't locked or bulletproof --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what is a gun gonna do if they're grabbed from behind?  Are they gonna have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- enough time to get that gun?  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, you're right and then also if they, uh, basically have a hostage outside and they say, "Hey, you know, we're gonna kill her if you don't open the doors", [NOISE] what do they do?  Let him -- her be killed and keep flying the plane or what?
R:  [LAUGH] Right, and you know what?  Th- The public shouldn't even know that those guys -- the pilots are gonna have guns because now the terrorists know they have guns and they're gonna be prepared for that too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] That should've been kept confidential.
L:  I know, they really -- yeah, it was on CNN -- yeah, I know what you mean.  But I'm kinda -- [COUGH] it's kind of a pain in the butt during the holidays having to go through the lines 'cause [COUGH] I used to buddy pass in October and when you use the buddy pass they always like triple, double check you, I guess, 'cause employees' friends have brought drugs and stuff on before and --
R:  Oh.
L:  I was just grateful to get the flight.  I wasn't mad or anything [MN] but a lot of people were making big scenes on it, especially the people that paid first class [COUGH].  They thought 'cause they paid first class they should just be pushed through the lines and [SIGH] you know --
R:  Hey, anybody could pay for pr- --
L:  Like, I'm sorry, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pe- terrorists don't have anything to waste their money on, so --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- they could probably afford first class. [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not me [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.  I tell you, you know, um, a friend of mine, her husband works for IBM, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a -- a -- a white guy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he travels a lot and he travels with one of his, uh, partners at IBM --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's, um, like, you know, looks Middle Eastern --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or is Middle Eastern, I'm not sure exactly what --
L:  Does he get checked a lot?
R:  No, not the Middle Easterner.  My friend's husband!  
L:  Isn't that weird?
R:  Every time they travel together he gets stopped and the other guy doesn't.
L:  My goodness.
R:  Is that unbelievable?
L:  Is that something? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, 'cause they do them randomly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- okay, one, two, three.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Okay, the third one gets checked.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But it shouldn't be like that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it should be --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- who looks like what.
L:  You're right.  
R:  Ya know?
L:  -- if I was one of them I wouldn't mind being targeted because I'd figure people would feel safer if they knew I'd been checked out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ya know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I'd understand.
R:  We were cracking up when he tells the story.  It's just so funny.  And he says to his friend, he goes, "Me, me the white guy, what about you?  You look like the terrorist". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Really?  I know.  I know, they always check us and we're like the buddy pass people that -- you know, we're American -- I've got blond hair and so has my boyfriend.  Ya know -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  W- We're like white and pasty --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we're not even -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- ya know?  Looks -- we need to go somewhere to get a tan and they've --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- really checked us, like thoroughly -- [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Where you from again, again?
L:  I'm in Atlanta right now --
R:  Atlanta.
L:  -- but we went to Hawaii in October and they had us take our shoes off and everything.  We [LAUGH] were like, "All right".  You know, we were just grateful to get the cheap seats and [NOISE] didn't care really --
R:  Yeah, you know my cousin and my aunt came in from Florida the same way and their feet were checked too.
L:  Yeah, we were like, wow, you know there are people that really looked a lot more terroristic than we did. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  We weren't gonna complain.  We were grateful to get those buddy passes at cheap seats, you know, but --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- it was kinda weird how they didn't really target what they looked like and what do those people expect?  If I looked like that I'd think -- you know, I don't know.  It seems to me like if they really wanna live in our country and they wanna do right by us they wouldn't mind us checking 'em a little more thoroughly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  B- I guess the heightened airport security and it's cost -- it costs like on the buddy pass thing it costs five dollars extra per thing.  I don't know if I'm really getting my value for my dollar on that because it seems like they had a lot of people in Atlanta on TV that, um, have taken a lot of different, like, you know, Q -- um, like not Q tips but the, um, tweezers and stuff like that on the plane, so, it seems like they're still getting through a lot of stuff like just some of those people, I guess --
R:  That's what I'm saying, there can never be enough security.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Well, there's always -- 
L:  Do you feel s- --
R:  -- they'll figure out a way around anything.  That's why --
L:  Do you feel safe flying?  I mean, how do you feel about it?
R:  Um, it's not like I feel safe or not safe, I just don't let it bother me and I -- I -- I would get on a plane in a -- in a second.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that doesn't bother me at all.  That doesn't bother me at all.
L:  I'm glad they have some security there, but --
R:  [MN] Yeah, I --
L:  -- it doesn't seem like they've caught anybody yet, you know?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, if it's just so great how come they haven't caught anyone?
R:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It seems like [SIGH] -- but then, uh, maybe they're targeting the little airports now and stuff.
R:  Hey, there was the -- you know, they had film of, uh, [MN] you know the World Trade Center with, um, [MN] the guy that planned the whole thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they actually went back to tapes, I guess, because you know there's monitors --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that -- that were in that building --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they saw him, like, with a -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a video camera and he was taping --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like all certain spots.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How come they didn't catch this a few [LAUGH] years ago --
L:  I know, I mean like --
R:  -- before it happened. [LAUGH]
L:  -- what tourist is gonna be going and taking pictures like he was?  They were -- a tourist would be going on the top floor and taking pictures of the sights 'cause I was in that restaurant -- the World Trade Center -- I've been in there before.  It's like -- it had -- it was called Windows of the World and it rotated --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it turned and you would, you know, take pictures of like the different parts of New York --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you wouldn't take pictures of what he was doing, like the structures and stuff.
R:  Yes, he was.
L:  It was real obvious to me when they showed the video. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you saw it too right?
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah, I was like, "Wait a minute, ya know, he's not taking pictures of sexy women, gay men --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he -- taking pictures of the sights --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- he's taking pictures of the fucking bottom of the building".
R:  I know.
L:  I thought that was pretty, you know, kinda --
R:  I know, I was like watching this on TV --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and going, "Holy shit, I don't believe it".
L:  Me too.  I thought, you know, they had cameras in there -- I know they did because they had 'em on the elevators and stuff when you went in because -- I remember 'cause there was security guards when you went in.  Ya didn't have to sign in or anything, but you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as long as you had -- like you were going to the restaurant and if you weren't going to the restaurant you had to pay a fee to get in or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] But, um --
R:  I just think, you know, no matter how much heightened security they have at the airport the best thing is to have those -- those --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- those bulletproof doors --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just like, um --
L:  Oh, yeah -- [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, um, the --
L:  Like the Israelis.
R:  -- Israeli planes.  The --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Israeli airlines because they haven't had one incident since they did that.
L:  Yeah, they haven't and their pilots don't have to worry about having guns 'cause they've got two expert marksmen behind 'em with guns, so they just worry about flying the plane, what they should do, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then they've [NOISE] got these two guys that just sit there with their armored stuff and their guns on.  They haven't even made it through to the first set of doors, as far as I'm -- as I've heard --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the Israelis, you know, so you'd think that obviously, as paranoid as we are about everything else going on, it seems like we would've followed their lead on that.
R:  You know what, American Airlines don't wanna spend the money, but you know what?  Maybe the government should back them and do it for them.
L:  Yeah, it's true too.  I mean, you know they're gonna probably [NOISE] -- they're gonna target anybody it's gonna be somebody called American Airlines. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  The name, but -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's sad that that happened to those people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Really 'cause a lot of people --
R:  And we'll still let all of them, you know, people come here and live.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah --
R:  You know?
L:  I don't understand that at all, do you?
R:  No.
L:  You feel like, you know, why don't they do -- instead of heightened security, why don't they do heightened measures of people getting in the damn country and staying.  
R:  That's right.
L:  I'm sorry, but I don't think we need more foreigners here.  I'm not trying to be a bitch of anything, but I know a lot of people that can't get good jobs.  I wouldn't be doing this for ten bucks if I had a great job, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, so --
R:  No, they took over a lot of our jobs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And our businesses --
L:  [NOISE] Yep.
R:  -- Seven Elevens, gas stations --
L:  Yep, and then you know they'll -- they'll basically work for so much cheaper and under the table and not pay taxes so they're not really benefiting [NOISE] us being here.
R:  Not at all 'cause they're still m- -- they're still making more money here than they made in their country.
L:  Yeah, and they don't pay taxes and it's all tax free.  They're [NOISE] illegal and stuff -- [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  It doesn't seem fair.
R:  Yep.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know, I resent it 'cause I don't have -- I'm not a Rockefeller or anything but [LAUGH] you know, I'm not [inaudible] --
R:  No, but ya -- the -- the point is we help everybody else and not our own.
L:  Yeah, and we're probably the ones -- the more poor ones, [NOISE] like I'm the one that like I donated blood and money to the Red Cross and things when this happened -- nine eleven --
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I know, thinking a lot of those people -- if I was a foreigner I would've like wanted people to know how pro American I was and --
R:  Yeah, no, half of them were standing out on the streets and cheering, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, Saddam. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know it.
R:  Right in front of Americans on TV.
L:  They make you sick.
R:  It does, it makes you really sick.
L:  They bitch so much about our country, why don't they move back to theirs?
R:  Yeah, why are they here?  They bad mouth us but they're still here.
L:  Uh, I wish that -- I wish they would hire like folk -- Americans to do the security checks too 'cause a lot of those foreigners, if they see someone that looks like them, do you really think they're gonna target themself?  I don't think so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  As far as the heightened security --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I always see like Hatam[?] or Abdul.  They're fucking checking me out and I'm going through airport security.  I'm thinking, "You look more like a damn terrorist than I do".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My family -- you have a New York accent, by the way, are you from up there?
R:  What?  Yeah --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- I'm originally from Brooklyn but I live in Jersey --
L:  Are you?  My dad lives up in Brooklyn.  So, you know, someone with an accent like yours, you know, it shouldn't -- it se- sounds so damn American they shouldn't target you.  Why not target Hateem who speaks broken English, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] I know --
L:  [LAUGH] I'll get this stuff at the airport --
R:  I hear ya.
L:  -- and half of them are foreigners -- I just don't -- I don't know in Atlanta there are like a lot of foreigners checking us and I kinda think it's odd they're checking us and they always target me and I'm like a fat, white, blond, ya know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't even look the last thing like a fucking terrorist --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ya know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just don't [LAUGH] understand why they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- target me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess, 'cause I look so different than them.
R:  [LAUGH] You couldn't be any more American looking, right?
L:  I know, it's like shit I've got apple pie, pizza, everything on my body, ya know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm American --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all the way. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, seriously --
R:  [LAUGH] You're a riot!
L:  [LAUGH]
