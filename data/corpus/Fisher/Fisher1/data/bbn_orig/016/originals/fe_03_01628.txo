R:  Hi, this is Joyce Munro.
L:  [MN] Hi, this Denise Ettnoyer[?].
R:  Hi, Denise, how are you?
L:  I'm good.  And you?
R:  Good.  I don't know if this is the first one that you've done of these?
L:  Um, I've done -- I -- I've done one other one, but it's been a couple of months since I've done one.
R:  Oh, well, gre- -- this is my first one so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, maybe if you want to start off, that would be great.
L:  Oh.  Well, I know the last time when I did it and we just kind of, you know, talked for a couple of minutes about ourselves, you know, where we're from and so forth and I --
R:  Sure.
L:  I'm from Lancaster, Pennsy- -- well, Newmanstown, Pennsylvania. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  We moved recently [LAUGH] in the past year.  [SIGH] But, um -- um, are you familiar with the area at all?
R:  That's really interesting.  Actually I grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, you're kidding me?
R:   So, ah -- no, isn't that amazing?  It's a small world.  But I don't live there now, I actually live, um, [SIGH] live outside of, um, excuse me, Boston, Massachusetts --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in, um, [LIPSMACK] Lexington.
L:  Okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Okay.  Oh, very interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, that's funny.  [LAUGH] Never --
R:  [MN]
L:  Never would have thought.  'Cause people, you know, you say places and you have no idea. [MN]
R:  That's right.  So, what high school did you go to?
L:  A- Lan- Lancaster Catholic.
R:  Oh, I went to, um, excuse me, I went to, um, McCaskey.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, right around the corner.
L:  Can I ask how old you are?
R:  Sure, I'm thirty three.
L:  Okay, I'm tr- -- I have some cousins who went there --
R:  Oh.
L:  But I think they're a little bit older.  Um, my maiden name's Brubaker.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah --
R:  Which is a very, very --
L:  Very common name.
R:  -- common name [LAUGH] in Lancaster.
L:  Yeah.  But -- but you would have graduated probably -- well, if you would've -- I have some brothers and sisters who went to Lancaster Catholic around your age too.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ... [SIGH] But anyway, I guess we should get on the topic.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  So, th- the question was about the Middle East, about peace, correct?
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN] Um, I personally feel -- like, I'm not big into war.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- but I really feel something needed to be done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I personally feel the conditions over there are terrible.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And Saddam Hussein, I just think is crazy and needed to be stopped.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] How about you?
R:  [MN] Well, I'll tell you, I am -- [NOISE] [MN] I'm a relatively new mom.  I mean, I have a three year old.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, I find that because I'm working full time as well that I don't have h- -- time to really make sure that I have the full range of news and information that I need to kind of make what I consider to be a very well informed decision or -- or thought about this issue.
L:  That's a very good point.
R:  And, um, because I spent a couple of years in the, um, [MN] excuse me.  Because I spent a couple of years in the Air Force [MN] I really, um, h- have this kind of bigger picture perspective of things, of kind of relying on our elected officials and the political process to really bring about, um, a situation that is, for the time, perhaps the most positive.  And, ah, [MN] although it will all kind of take time to kind of see how it plays out, um, I guess I have faith in our political system to be leading us in a direction that is, um, that is right.  And if it's not right then the political process will make a change.  So, I -- I guess it's not very specific to the peace process specifically, but I -- um, and to the war that we're currently involved in right now, um, but I guess I put a lot of trust and faith into our system.  Not necessarily Bush, because I'm not necessary supportive of him personally.  I didn't vote for him.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, just the system as a whole.  Do you -- a- -- do you have some thoughts --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Actually I'm real curious about your thoughts about, um, not just Iraq but the, um, Israeli --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- excuse me, the Israeli Palestinian conflict?  Which I think is even more difficult of an issue to see that it can possibly be resolved.
L:  [SIGH] I -- I really don't know.  Like, I -- I -- I have to agree with you, ah -- well, I'm a new mom myself.  I --
R:  Uh-huh, oh, congratulations.
L:  I have a twenty two month old and I also have a nine week old.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, it's very difficult to sit down and read a paper.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And just very busy.  So, I have to agree with you as far as not knowing -- like, sitting down and knowing all the facts.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] I -- I agree with you there.  Um, and it is very hard.  But you -- you on the other hand, can -- you said you were in the Air Force?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That, to me -- you -- you get to see what's happening.  Like, in the military and yo- you've had that experience and everything that you kind of know what's happening and [MN] -- not fully but, you know, you've had that experience.
R:  Well, right.  Well, I w- -- I was in a long time ago and it was actually kind of curious.  I was in during the Gulf War.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, um, I actually felt very connected to, um, to what was going on there because it just seemed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more real, it seemed more present.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it was actually very surreal to me when the Iraq war began.  Um, and the work that I'm doing now, which is completely different, um, from my Air Force experience, um, I -- I work for a town, I'm the Assistant Town Administrator for a small town outside of Boston and I was in a staff meeting righ- right after the war broke out.  And [MN] I was just sitting there as a discussion came up about how many reservists we have working for the town.  Turned out no one.  No one works for the town --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, no one who works for the town is a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  reservist, which really shocked me.
L:  [NOISE] Hm.
R:  And it was just amazing sitting in that meeting thinking, "Oh, my god, this is so surreal".  There's -- there's no connection.  There's no connection whatsoever to this war.  Whereas before, during the last war, there was such a strong connection because of the work that I was doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um ...
L:  Yeah.  [MN] But I -- I mean, it's a very scary thought, raising a child in today's age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I would like to think peace could come out of this but I seriously doubt it will.  Um, you have many people over there right now who just object to the US forces being in Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I -- you know, you just -- who knows [NOISE] who -- that their, um, their government, who is still alive, who is dead.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, will we ever know?  Who knows?
R:  Right.
L:  And I really feel that there's going to be some retaliation somehow against us.
R:  Right.
L:  Whether it's like th- the nine eleven attacks or, you know, s- s- some way I think something's going to happen.  Hopefully not as horrible as that, but you just don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I mean, I know one thing, um, [LIPSMACK] the US is trying to do over there is find -- find their weapons.
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, has that been done yet, do you know?
R:  Well --
L:  Have they found any of the ma- -- the weapons of mass destruction --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- that we've been searching for?
R:  I think it depends how you define weapons of mass destruction.  I think that -- that the typical way that it's defined as far as, um, nukes and things like that, haven't been found.  But significant, um, excuse me, some significant chemical weapons and chemicals, I suppose, have been -- have been found.  Um, but not a huge, huge smoking gun yet, so ...
L:  I -- I mean, my -- my uncle -- we were talking about this briefly yesterday.  My uncle was saying about -- he -- it's not that he's not in favor of the war but he's not in complete agreement with it.  But he [LAUGH] -- he said that he wouldn't be surprised if at some point weapons of mass destruction are found, whether they're found legitimately or we plant them and find them.  [MN] But just so we can put people's mind at ease type of thing.
R:  Hm.
L:  But I -- I don't w- -- I don't know.  Do you think the US would ever do something like that?
R:  I would certainly hope not.  I think that, um, the testimony that we're beginning to get back from, um, people about the way life was in Iraq under Saddam's merg- -- regime are kind of significant enough for a lot of people at least, to recognize that, um, that life for a great number of people of Iraqis wasn't truly free.  And, um, that to me is perhaps an even more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- important issue that what bombs, um, they may have had.
L:  True, true.  That's true.  But I know -- I mean, it's just [LIPSMACK] -- I just don't know about peace though.  Th- that's my [LIPSMACK] -- I just don't know if -- if that will happen or not.  And [NOISE] I'm sure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people didn't think this war would probably be even lasting this long.  And, I mean, is there really -- is there -- I haven't been watching the news lately.  Is there even bombing going on right now or anything?
R:  No. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  No, there's not.  Um, we're hearing now of occasional sni- -- occasional, um, sniper attacks --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- on individual troops.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, but, um, it seems to be pretty more or less over, the significant portion --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- of the war.  I think there was actually, um, ah, surprise from a lot of people's parts that it did actually conclude, or seem to wrap up this quickly as it has, gi- given [SIGH] -- given how, ah, this is probably one of the first times that we as a country have invaded another country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- without defen- -- [MN] without defending, ah, friends, if that makes sense.  I mean, the last time with the Iraqi war was involved with Kuwait --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and defending Kuwait.  Um, but to aggressively
