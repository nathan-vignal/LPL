R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Cindy.
L:  Hi, Cindy.
R:  Um, what's your name?
L:  Elizabeth.
R:  Hi, Elizabeth.  I'm pleased to meet -- ah, pleased to talk to you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, this is my second call. [LAUGH]
L:  Me too.
R:  And they've called me a couple of times today and then couldn't find anyone.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I, um, [MN] I -- [MN] I really -- I -- I guess, um, I -- we need to really finish up in the Middle East as far as I'm concerned.  We're there now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, [MN] um, I -- I think that I -- you know, I -- I -- I'm not a pro war, I don't believe in war.  I don't like, you know, like wa- --
L:  Did you think that we should have gone?
R:  Well, ah, yeah, I do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I think that there's a whole lot of stuff that we don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  Ah, we -- or [MN] -- I know we hear things from the media but I think there is a lot of things that we don't know about that we just have to trust our government I guess eno- enough to know that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that we needed to be there to protect a lot of people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Um, i- it's a shame that it had to be handled by war.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um [NOISE] --
L:  It seems like [COUGH] these Shiite Muslims, who are the majority over there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, that just don't want to cooperate and they want us out, like, I think they're going to make it very difficult.
R:  I think so too.  I think so too.  And I think only time will tell.  I just -- I -- I hope that we f- -- we f- -- we finish bef- -- you know, finish up and to the best of our ability --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to help the -- the-- the -- the common people.
L:  Uh-huh.  Now, who is this guy?  I was just watching the news.  There was this guy that was designated, like, our guy in charge over there.  Have you see that?
R:  No, I haven't, no.
L:  Because th- -- he just -- he -- I -- I just turned on the news like kind of late and, um, and I didn't recognize his name or recognize him to look at him.  And he just arrived in Baghdad today.  And everybody was saying, you know, "Why wasn't he there earlier?" and all this stuff.  And they said he has a staff of four hundred and fifty people and so on and so forth.  And, um --
R:  Um, I don't -- I don't know.  Ah, is he -- is he a -- is he from -- from I- Iraq or?
L:  No, no.  He didn't look like it.  He just looked like some, you know, regular old, ah, white guy. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm, oh, I don't know.
L:  Walking down the street --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- waving to everybody.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't h- -- I don't know.  I -- I haven't seen the news today so ...
L:  [MN] Okay.  I -- I just -- I just flipped it on and I thought, "Wow, this is a new development.  'Cause -- 'cause -- well, there was some guy who was supposed to be designated as the one being in charge of implementing the government.  Maybe it was that same guy, 'cause he wasn't involved in the war itself at all.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, he must be somebody they carefully selected.  And certainly a lot of research has gone into it, so I hope they know what they're doing.
R:  Yeah, ah, th- there's been -- I- I've heard several reports of who we're going to send to try to get things together and I -- I -- I -- but I haven't heard that they've sent anybody.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I knew they were kinda -- Tony Blair and -- and President Bush were mulling over who they would be the best person to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- send to try to get, you know, get -- to get Iraq back on its feet and --
L:  Oh, right.  But this -- this is the interim guy.
R:  Oh, I don't --
L:  This is like the American guy who's supposed to be, you know, the temporary thing.
R:  Oh, okay.  I don't -- I don't know who that is.
L:  So, you know.
R:  How did you find out about doing the, um, doing the survey?  I, ah --
L:  Ah, my girlfriend sent me an email and --
R:  Oh, okay, I just wondered.  I -- I go on a website that -- tha- -- where I read about it.  Um, it's called Big Big Savings and I -- people were talking about it there and I -- I just --
L:  Big Big Savings?
R:  Yeah, [MN] it's a -- it's a, ah -- [MN] their mess- -- I go onto their message boards and read it.  Th- there's things, you can take surveys and do all different kinds of things.
L:  Oh, ways to make money with --
R:  Yeah, if yo- --
L:  -- email and ways to save money and stuff like that?
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Special deals that are going on at stores and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and things like that.  And I just thought maybe you were from there.  They have quite a large, ah, ah, population on that -- that website and I just thought maybe you --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- were from there.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll have to check that out.
R:  Yeah, it's Big Big Savings dot com and then you can go into the forums and they different categories, I mean, you know, for shopping and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all kinds of things.
L:  Now, wh- -- ah, ah, what do you think this study is about?
R:  Ah, you know, I'm not sure.  I take, ah, surveys from Doctor John Barren also from University of Pennsylvania on Thursdays.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, his is always -- i- it's the Psychology Department so his are always really thought provoking.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, s- and I would imagine Fisher is from the same department.
L:  Oh.
R:  And that's what I fi- -- ah, but I can't figure out what all the -- y- they ask you if you have the different telephones.
L:  All this telephone business.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  I was wondering if they were monitoring like the quality of --
R:  I- --
L:  -- of, um, the transmission of -- of the conversation or something.
R:  It very well could be, I don't know.  Ah, I don't know but I -- I feel that it comes from the Psychology Department somewhere.
L:  Oh.
R:  'Cause that's really -- really a strong force at the University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I --
L:  But it -- it is kind of interesting [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  -- focus on the mode of, ah -- plus you could make an extra fifty dollars if you were, ah, able to call from five different phones or something.
R:  Well, but it's a --
L:  Did you see that?
R:  Yeah, yeah, but it's more -- it's more than that because it would be twenty five calls.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  So that's ten dollars a call.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So it'd be two hundred and fifty dollars.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But if -- if you like to do surveys and things like that and want to know different ones, um, I -- as a matter of fact the last person I disc- -- I talked with over a -- on a topic, I emailed him, it was a young fella from the University of Utah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I emailed him.  I've got a list of all kind of surveys -- of companies if you want to make extra money.
L:  Really?
R:  And it doesn't cost you anything, yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  If you'd like me to send it to you I would.
L:  I would like it. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, what's your email address?
L:  E -- E.B.E.T.H., ebeth.
R:  Okay. E.B.E.T.H., ebeth.
L:  R -- R.D.
R:  R.D.
L:  Registered dietitian, that's what I am.
R:  O- oh, okay.
L:  And that's at AOL.
R:  At AOL, okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I would really appreciate that.
R:  Yeah, I've got a big list.  And you just sign up and then -- I'm -- I'm doing pretty well [LAUGH] wi- --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  A lot of people are.  It's just a -- I'm, um, [MN] sort of -- I've -- I- I worked in the mental health field for --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- many years and I'm staying at home now and it's -- you know, it's a little shopping money for here and there, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My husband's still working and he's getting ready to retire in about seven years so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, yeah, that's -- and I -- I -- I do quite well.  Some of the, um, some of the group, ah, like group discussions and stuff you can get in, you can make two hundred dollars.
L:  [MN] Y- -- like a focus group kind of thing?
R:  Yeah, focus group but over the internet, yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  And there's -- I'll -- I'll type you a little letter, ah, or I'll -- I'll type a little something on there and explain more of it to ya and tell you which ones are the best.  But I'll give you the -- I've probably got two hundred different companies you can sign up for and take surveys with.
L:  I'd really appreciate that 'cause I love doing these little things.
R:  Mm, oh, I do too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I do too.  It gives me -- it's kind of a hobby for me now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And plus I make money with my hobby.  And most hobbies cost you money so ... [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- that's true.  That's true.
R:  But I'll -- yes, I'll more than be happy to send that to you.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I haven't the young man, whether he's, ah, done any surveys or not.  He's getting ready to go to Brazil.  He's a, uh, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] i- it's sort of a -- he's with the J- ah, Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints Church and he's going to Brazil to be a missionary.
L:  Oh, holy smoke.
R:  And he was trying to make money [LAUGH] to go.
L:  And he needs the money. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But, ah -- well, back to topic I guess here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I find, um -- I wish that there was a sports topic. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I know.
L:  I'm like -- I'm like the mi- -- peace in the Middle East, I was like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Oh, man" [LAUGH] what a topic.
R:  I -- I mean, we all want that.  I mean, you know, I can- -- I don't know of one person that doesn't want peace anywhere, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, you [MN] -- you enjoy sports?
L:  Yes.
R:  Wha- what- what's your favorite sport?
L:  All of 'em.  The, ah, football and, ah, basketball.  Right now basketball because it's the playoffs, of course.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  Y- y- so you're an NBA fan?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  I like college basketball.  I'm a -- I love college basketball.  I'm a University of Kentucky fan, even though I live in Ohio.
L:  You live where?
R:  Yep.
L:  I'm from Ohio.
R:  Oh, really?  I'm in West Central Ohio.  Ah, do you know where Dayton is?
L:  I went to college at UD.
R:  UD, okay, well I -- o- obviously I love UD basketball.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I- I- I'm a -- but I'm from the old school.  I remember the old Donny, Don May.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm just north of there, um, between Sydney and Lima.  I live in a little small town.
L:  Ah, wha- what's it called?
R:  Jackson Center.
L:  Oh, no, haven't heard of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I grew up in Columbus.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I lived in Cleveland for a while too.
R:  Okay.  I have a sister in law and brother in law that live in Cleveland.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, actually they live in, ah, Lake Country, they live east of Cleveland.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, around the Willoughby area.
L:  Uh, oh yeah, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, ah, but, um, yeah, I just -- [MN] and you -- do you live in Ohio now?
L:  No, I live in Philadelphia now.
R:  In Philadelphia, oh, okay.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, UD's a good school.  It's a nice school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Small.
L:  I enjoyed it.
R:  Very small and -- and just nice people.
L:  Helped me get on my way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, peace in the Middle East.
R:  Middle East. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] B- back to that topic.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, what do you -- you know, I'll tell you what I think about peace in the Middle East.  I am very upset with our country over our blind support of Israel.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- blind's not really the right word, but I think that is the cause of so much animosity towards us because they are such big bullies.  And they're doing -- they do so many of the things that we tell other people not to do.
R:  To do, uh-huh.
L:  And we just keep supporting them and supporting them.
R:  Well, but you know what the difference is?  They have the Israeli Air Force and that is one of our biggest fears.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The Israeli Air Force is so scary.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because they are so trained because we helped train 'em.
L:  Right.
R:  They -- th- there's so many -- and there's so much money there.
L:  You think it's because we're afraid of them that we --
R:  I think that has a lot --
L:  -- support 'em?
R:  I h- think that has a lot to do with 'em.  We don't want to tangle with them.
L:  Right.
R:  We do not want to tangle with.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they could get support
