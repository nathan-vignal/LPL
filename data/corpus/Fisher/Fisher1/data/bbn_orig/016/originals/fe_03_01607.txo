R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, I'm Cheryl.
R:  Hi, I'm Cathy.
L:  Hi, Cathy.  
R:  So -- 
L:  You said Cathy or Kelly? 
R:  No, Cathy.
L:  Hi, Cathy.  Where are you at? 
R:  I'm in Iowa.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm from -- Id- Idaho.
R:  Idaho? 
L:  I am from Idaho, I was born there.
R:  That's funny.
L:  But I'm in California.
R:  Oh, okay, okay, well, I'm glad to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  So how do you feel about this?
L:  Ah, let's see.  I was running water so [LAUGH] I missed a little bit of it.  It's airport security and -- 
R:  Yeah, on how we feel, do we feel safe enough with the airport security that -- that they have in place now? 
L:  Um, you know, I -- I don't know if I am.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't travel a whole lot anyway.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, [SIGH] you know, I don't know if I would honestly go on the airplane at this point.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause anywhere that I would go, I can drive.
R:  Oh, well, that makes sense.
L:  So it's, like, okay, if I can drive and be safer, then -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- I think I would.
R:  As long as my feet are on the ground, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I would probably say that too except that friends of mine moved from Iowa to Florida and invite -- gave me a birthday present of a ticket to come down there so I was kind of forced to get unscarred because it was either take the ticket and go or, you know, use it, not use it.
L:  Right.
R:  So I did go and so I -- I just -- um, I did that at the end of February so I did kind of see the security that they have in place.
L:  Right.
R:  And believe me, if there's one little tiny thing wrong with you -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you sit in line forever.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I mean, not in line, but you're off, you know, in a -- in a special place.
L:  [NOISE] Could --
R:  Yeah, and what was -- it was funny to me, um, Moline, Illinois which is not -- it's -- it's hundreds of thousands of people in the quad cities, okay -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is west -- I mean, east of me but it's not big like San Diego or Los Angeles or anything like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And believe me, the security there was amazing.  And -- but it was funny because, and I don't mean to be rude or anything, but the three people that were sitting there were all, um, mid- middle eastern people.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and so I'm sure -- I mean, I -- I would think that I knew if I was one that I would be targeted anyway.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, whether you're a bad ga- guy or not, you look like one because you're from there. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, and at this point, sorry to say but -- [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah -- 
L:  That's just part of --
R:  -- I mean, better to be safe than sorry because who in the heck wants to -- I was really, really, really very nervous because I hadn't flown for a long time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, with all this stuff, like you said, if I was going to go somewhere, I'd either drive or I wouldn't go there [LAUGH] but when they sent me this ticket, it was like, "Oh, gosh, what do I do?"
L:  Right.
R:  But the security was really tight and I mean, I -- and I know when I came back it was -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I went to Daytona and when I went to -- caught -- fly back -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I had to ta- take off my shoes even.
L:  I was just going to ask you, did -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you see anything because I was one of my other things, was because after they had all that high security and everything -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they -- somebody got in with -- we- he had something in his shoe.
R:  He had ex- um, um, high powered explosives in his shoes.
L:  Yeah, I'm like, "Hello, okay", that was one of the huge reasons why I'm, like, you know, if that's getting by -- 
R:  Yeah.  Well, they-- they make you put everything, everything out on the, you know, either in those little trays.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or if it's a bag and if they see anything they put that bag back through a whole bunch of times and if there's something that they can't figure out -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they'll take it over to the side and move you and they'll go through the whole bag.
L:  [NOISE] Really? 
R:  'Cause I watched 'em do it, yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, so I was very careful about what I took, you know.
L:  I was going to say I would have a little bit of a --
R:  You can't take razors or anything like that with you, you know.
L:  I've got a titanium rod in my leg now from surgery. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, see I have, um, doc was telling me, my chiro, he's got, you know, lots of rods and stuff in him because he was in a really bad car accident.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, he said it was a little tricky getting out to LA because it took him so long because he kept tripping the thing when he went through.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, it was very obvious because you can tell by the way he's so crippled up that there is, you know, and he told 'em and it didn't -- it didn't take him that long he said, but, you know, if it would have been somebody else that would have looked different maybe it would have been, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, I was really -- I took -- I tell you I really was impressed but --
L:   Get down. 
R:  Um, and that you can't even, you know, like when you're sitting there waiting for your flight -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, you can't even let your bag sit there.
L:  Really?
R:  You know, like, if you were going to get up there's a waste basket, you know, just like three, four, five steps away from you -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- don't leave it sit there because if you do, um, -- 
L:  You go through.
R:  -- the security will be there immediately.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, no because they think somebody's got explosive in their bag and they're trying to leave it.
L:  Oh.
R:  So you can't -- you ha- you can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- leave your bags unattended or -- 
L:  [NOISE] That's good then.
R:  Oh, yes, it's definitely good.
L:  You know, I mean, I -- I obviously -- I have- haven't been to an airport since all this happened so I have no clue.
R:  Right.  Well, see, neither had I and if I hadn't gone on this trip, I wouldn't have known but, um, but I felt, you know, by the time, I mean, the -- the -- when I first was going on in Moline [LAUGH] I was scared to death 'cause I kept saying -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm never going to make [inaudible] I know I'm going to get blown up or something, you know.  
L:  Oh, you know, that's -- I did ha- my mom had to come out last year when I fell and broke my leg and my foot.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because I've got three little ones and so, yeah, you know, I do remember that I couldn't go in, like, -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can only so far and this is in, um, Burbank airport.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is a very tiny airport.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, because, I mean, it's a largish --
R:  You can't even in Moline either.  I mean, once you say goodbye -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then they go on through period.  You can't -- I mean, it used to be you could go in and wait for 'em right there at the door where they come out of the plane, you know.
L:  Right, yeah, I know -- 
R:  No more.
L:  -- we couldn't do that.  We actually had to wait outside next to the luggage area.
R:  Right.
L:  And even then, it was very, you know, they were really watching everybody and stuff so but, ah, yeah, I -- I do remember [NOISE] that and, and, ah, my mom, I remember her saying because, you know, she's, oh gosh, what is she, sixty seven, sixty eight, something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they kept pulling her aside.  I'm, like, "Come on, she's a little old lady". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but, you know, it doesn't matter.  I mean, they just, you know, randomly pick people.
L:  Right, well she -- 
R:  And when you stop --
L:  -- kept getting picked.
R:  -- and think about it, anybody, um, could be paid money to do something.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  But really what you look like doesn't really matter.  I mean, you -- you -- you might pick some little old lady because they wouldn't look -- they wouldn't look like anybody was going to -- they were going to do anything to anybody.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that would be a perfect cover for somebody.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- 
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  I do have to say, that, you know, thinking about just getting back on a plane, I don't know if I would do it or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel a lot better now that I went.  I was -- I was so scared my girlfriend went the week after nine eleven and I told her she was out of her mind. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, because then the security was probably so high that there's, you know --
R:  Oh heavens.  It was -- well, and the worst part about it is  that, see, her daughter -- they lived out in Maryland and her daughter is back out there and they were in Washington DC the day it happened.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no.
R:  Yeah.  And so they couldn't even get back in their car because they were only about three blocks parked from the Capitol.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they weren't letting anybody out of there after the Pentagon got hit.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And she was scared to death because she thought, "Oh my God, what if they were anywhere near there, you know", and --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she was flipping out, and two weeks later she's flying out there, I said, "Are you out of your mind"?
L:  Yeah, see, I -- 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Even with everything that they've got in place now, I mean, even LAX, they've actually -- they, um, when the war started they started putting in the National Guard.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, what are they going to do?  You know -- [LAUGH]
R:  Shoot somebody if they have to.
L:  Yeah, but -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know what, there's still going to be crossfire, there still could be a bomb.
R:  That's true, that's true.
L:  You know, if they really want to get through, they're going to get through one way or the other -- 
R:  Well --
L:  -- they -- you know, the -- ah, yes, our -- our -- our security right now with the airports is extremely high.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I do think over the years they're going to let it lapse and then we're going to get nailed again and -- 
R:  Well, you know what --
L:  You know.
R:  -- you could be right about that because I notice when they just -- they, you know --  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They get to the fighting in Baghdad, they get -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And what are they doing?  They take it back down to yellow again.  I'm, like, "Well, I don't think that's a good idea just because we're done today we should change it back to yellow".
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's not like we don't have any problems.
R:  Yeah.  Is that a red light to say "Go ahead"? 
L:  Like, we don't have any problems with anybody else.
R:  I know.
L:  And not like a lot of the, um, middle eastern people from Iraq, like, they didn't skip over.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  You know, "Hello?" 
R:  Well, and now I just thought -- I was just reading a little bit ago on Yahoo that they got the guy -- the, um, one of the son in laws, the youngest daughter's husband of Saddam's.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  And he came back over from Syria and turned himself in.  So tell me Syria doesn't have anybody and they are not hiding 'em, you know.
L:  No, I know.
R:  Oh, brother, these people --
L:  Well, see and the thing is, yeah, let's -- let's drop the security at the airports because -- 
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- you know we have no worries.
R:  Well, on Tonight it -- it said on the news that, um, they -- the first group of pilots just got through with their class so they're going to be able to -- they will be carrying -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  If they want to, they can they can carry a gun.
L:  Right.
R:  And they were asking people on TV what they thought about that, you know, and I'm thinking well, the one guy made sense because he said, "Well, you know, if I was up in the air and somebody, you know, was flying the plane in and somebody came in" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "To get him at least, they could protect themselves" --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Yeah, but, yeah, but you blow -- you blow a gun off -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and what's going to happen? 
L:  The -- the cop pit -- the cockpit's going to lose its, ah, window [NOISE] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and you're going to go down anyway.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So that's another one of my -- 
R:  Don't fly, just drive. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's like, yeah, they have a right to protect themselves, I totally can understand it and I can see it, but then in the same sense, you know what, like the middle eastern people, they think they're doing this for Allah, you know. 
R:  Yeah, they think it's right.
L:  And -- and -- and they don't care -- they don't care who they take out, they don't care how many people -- 
R:  No, because that will give them -- it's kind of like what's Christian to get --
L:  It's the honor thing.
R:  -- more crowns by doing the right things.
L:  Right.
R:  They get more -- they get the higher spots with Allah because they are doing something -- 
L:  Took -- took out more people.
R:  Right.
L:  So I don't know if it's necessarily better that they're having the guns in the airplanes because, you know what, [MN] they're -- they have a conscious -- conscience, you know.
R:  Right, that you mean the pilots? 
L:  The --
