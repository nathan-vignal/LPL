L:  Hello? 
R:  Hi, I'm Pamela.
L:  [LAUGH] So am I.
R:  Are you really?
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  My nickname's Major, but, ah, --
L:  That's funny.  That's hard- you don't come across too many Pamelas. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  [LAUGH] Excuse me, I'm really tired today, and, ah, I wasn't gonna take the call, and I'm, like, "Oh, fine, I'll do it." [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, so what do you think -- oh, I see, what do I think of the Middle East.  Let's see.  No, I don't think it's gonna be peaceful over there, even though we intertwined.
L:  Anyways, still got a long ways to go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's a lot of work that needs to be done.
R:  Well, mine has to do with my faith in the Lord, and it, it can't get better until it gets worse, so ...
L:  I agree.  I have the same exact opinion.
R:  So, I don't know if you're -- have a faith in -- 
L:  Yes, I'm Elder, yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  And, ah, where are you calling from?
L:  Utah. [LAUGH]
R:  You're Utah, huh?
L:  We're -- my husband's going to Utah State.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're in Washington.  We're not too far away. [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Next door.
L:  No, I think -- yeah, I think it's gonna get worse before it's gonna get better.  There's gonna be another evil person coming up, and -- I don't know.  I --
R:  There has to be.
L:  Yeah. Yeah.
R:  But I really can't wait 'til Saddam Hussein and his family disappears.
L:  Yeah, that would be nice. [LAUGH]
R:  True.
L:  True, exactly.  I'm sorry, I'm so tired, I haven't had, like, consecutive few hours of sleep in the last couple of weeks. [LAUGH] I have two daughters that are, um, sick.
R:  Oh, jeez.
L:  So ...
R:  That's okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'll do more talking, how's that?
L:  [LAUGH] Well --
R:  Okay --
L:  -- I know -- the last person I talked to, his friend is one of the people that do the studies, and they just come up with the topics just to have people talk, but they're mostly just listening to dialect, so it almost doesn't even matter what people are talking about. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  What are they trying to find out?
L:  I have no idea.  I'm not, I'm not sure at all.
R:  What are they after, a dialect?
L:  It's something with the dia- I don't -- he -- his friend was the one that was one of the people doing the thing, and they do the topic so that they can at least have people to talk about while they study the conversations and their -- how they talk and stuff like that. [LAUGH] So I was, like, --
R:  Oh, so it really has --
L:  -- oh, how interesting.
R:  -- nothing to do with the, with the subject?
L:  Uh-uh, not at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Even though the papers said, or the, the internet thing says that we're to stay on the topic and ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, what else?  Let's see, stay on the topic and don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- don't probe the other person, ask them questions about the topic -- 
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and let them come up with their own answer.
L:  Hm.
R:  Had these guidelines.
L:  My dad was over in the Middle East during the, um, the Gulf War --
R:  Did he have any problems?
L:  No -- um, he was -- but he, um, did the, um, he talked to the airplanes, he was with the weather department.  But, um, it was hard -- it was weird 'cause now, since everything's on TV and you can see everything, like, happening instantaneously, if he was over there now with that same -- with the same technology, I don't think I could watch TV at all.  I would not want to know what was going on.
R:  I wouldn't either.
L:  It, it's way too hard.
R:  It's -- it's just hard, you know, it's -- I'm glad they're doing it, but it's just -- I know the suffering over there's horrible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it, it, you know, if we were in that same boat, we'd want someone to try to help us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the religion part gets in the way with, ah, [NOISE] with, um, over there.  There's so many different ones.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so they clash continually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.  So -- but, ah, -- kind of like over here, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah, they don't have any boundaries or anything, but I agree, there's, ah, we've got to have, ah, we've got to have, ah, one more ev- we've got to have an evil person that's, ah, brings the thirteen states together, thirteen countries together, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do their thing.  So ... it really doesn't matter.  This is just the next step, I think.
L:  I agree.  I -- yeah, I agree exactly.  I'm just on the same wavelength as you are, you know, it's gonna get worse before it gets better, and it's only another stage in the whole process.
R:  Yeah, it is.  Unfortunately if we were over there with our children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  I can't even imagine -- 
R:  -- that's the only thing that I think about, is, is I know that the Lord is, you know, God is -- he knows the bigger picture and I trust him and all ...
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  But if I was over there it would be hard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, we're in luxury.
L:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah, we take so much for granted over here.
R:  We really do, we really do.  And we don't give a lot back.
L:  Mhm.
R:  At least not over there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Of course, we can't even help our -- noone even helps their fellow neighbors these days.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Everyone kinda keeps to themselves.  It's kinda sad.
L:  Well we -- I live on campus in family housing, and it's really nice 'cause we're all just, like, one nice little community here. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:   We're all in the same boat. [LAUGH] We're all poor college students trying to raise families.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, it's fun.  We'll have barbecues and we're, like, okay, "We're barbecuing, come on and join us," you know, it's really nice, you know, we all know what's going on and, you know, whoever has babies they got meals all lined up, and --
R:  Oh my goodness.  So how old are your children?
L:  I have a two and a half year old and a nine month old.
R:  Oh, you're got to be young then.
L:  Yeah, I'm only twenty four. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  You're young.  You're our oldest child's age.
L:  I'm my parents' oldest child. [LAUGH]
R:  Are you really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I am. [LAUGH]
R:  That's kinda weird, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But, you know, they wouldn't change it for the --
R:  So what's your middle name?
L:  Anne.
R:  Mine's Pamela Elaine.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
R:  Usually I hear people call themselves Pam, or something else.
L:  I, ah, -- y- --
R:  People usually call me Pammy Jo.
L:  I always like Pamela, when people call me Pam I'm like, oh, "It's Pamela". [LAUGH]
R:  I like Pamela.  I like that.
L:  I -- well, I was the radio DJ for a couple of years, and I was known by Pamela.  So that was --
R:  You were a radio DJ?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  I loved it.
R:  Talking to a celebrity.
L:  But now I'm a stay at home mom. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yes.  And that takes a lot of work.
L:  Yeah. It is -- oh, my good- especially when they're both sick. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Well, I'll tell you, you'll want 'em both to have chicken pox at the same time.
L:  I hope. [LAUGH]
R:  It's easy to do.
L:  [LAUGH] But it's real hard when they're both sick.
R:  Huh?
L:  It sure is hard when they're both sick.  Because --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- I don't have family nearby.
R:  But it's good to get it done and over with in one swoop.
L:  So, my two year old had her tonsils out, and then a few days later my nine month old, she's been dealing with some really bad reoccurring ear infections, that we're end up in the hospital every day getting them suctioned out and getting a shot for antibiotics.
R:  Wow.
L:  So it's -- I just can't imagine if I wasn't nursing how much worse they might be, that even the doctor said that.  So, poor thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So.  But, yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  So hopefully I'll get some sleep soon. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you will.  You will.  It won't last forever.
L:  I know, I have to tell myself that. [LAUGH]
R:  Trust me.
L:  Then I'm like, well, that's why I want to get the kids over with now and not drag it out.
R:  Oh, I, I love mine.
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  I couldn't get enough of our daughter.
L:  Oh.
R:  Couldn't get enough of her.  She was just -- I don't know.  We only had two.  Tried five times, but we only ended up with two.
L:  Oh.  Do you know what, that's so -- there's so many people here having fertility problems.  My neighbor's been trying for seven years.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.  And [MN] -- oh.  And she's such a sweet person.  She's so helpful and [SIGH] you're just, like, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- oh, you know, you just want to pray and wish that they can, you know, have, have a child.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  They can.  There's many of them out there.
L:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
R:  I'll tell you.  I -- I would adopt in a heartbeat, if I could do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd like a Chinese or an Asian child.
L:  Oh, I -- well there --
R:  A little girl.
L:  They just had a story on a family that went over there and just came back even though of the whole SARS thing.  It was really neat.  There's just, like, yeah, we knew we needed to go, despite the, the warnings, you know, we had prayed and we'd compl- and we, you know, we thought about it and we felt that we still needed to go and get, get her.  So it was a really neat story on the news.
R:  We need to -- we need to help.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  It's horrible.  It's like Romania.  Man, it's just horrible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's worse than the way the Iranians are living, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then if you think about it, there's places in the United States that are living like that.
