R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, hi, this is Roseanne.
R:  Hi, I'm Gina.
L:  Hi, Gina.
R:  How are you tonight?
L:  Um, okay.  I'm surprised because I've already had three phone calls. This is my fourth. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really, this is -- well, this is my second.  I did have two that I was unable to answer.  So this is actually my second that I've only talked on.
L:  Well, I've actually had one that I talked on and another one that noone answered, and then two that I talked on.  So I don't know if they're just gonna --
R:  Well --
L:  -- keep going or what.
R:  I don't know, but I guess it's okay, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  I guess so, it's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I talk to strangers all the time, but -- now what are we supposed to talk on again?  Issues in the Middle East.
R:  Issues in the Middle East.
L:  Boy, that's a good one.
R:  Yeah.  The first thought in my mind was --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- the war. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, me too.  I was like, "Oh, no".  Where are you from?
R:  Yeah.  I'm in Texas.
L:  Oh, so am I.
R:  Are you really?
L:  Yeah, I'm in San Antonio.
R:  Yeah.  Okay, well I'm close to Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I'm about ten miles outside of Dallas.
L:  Well, [LAUGH] I don't know if they're recording this, I'm sure, but my mother's Lebanese and my father was Irish, but she was -- she's Christian Lebanese.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, they, um, -- my grandparents were from Lebanon, but I think those people over there have been killing each other for yea- centuries. [LAUGH]
R:  For so long.
L:  I don't know if there'll ever be peace over there.
R:  I don't think so.  Personally, I don't.
L:  I don't either.  There's too many weird religious sects --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fighting against each other.
R:  There's too many people that's just gone crazy, just -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, my, my personal opinion is like, Saddam.  There's just -- there's too many of those.
L:  Mhm.  There really is.  It's almost beyond our understanding. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- I'm not even capable of relating to that, or how -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- those people have grown -- grown with that all these years.
R:  No, I don't, don't completely understand everything that's going on over there, but --
L:  No, I don't either.
R:  I don't even know if -- I don't know, I'm behind our country, but my father was in the military and my brother was in the military, and I'm totally behind our country --
L:  So am I.  Totally.
R:  -- and our people --
L:  We're from Texas.  Everybody else I've spoken to has been from California, Washington, --
R:  [LAUGH] Really?
L:  Yeah, and they're like, "Well I don't know about this war", and I'm like, "Be very careful okay, 'cause I'm from Texas". [LAUGH] We have four military bases and I work in a military commissary.
R:  Really?
L:  I'm a sales rep, yeah, at the military commissary, so ... 
R:  Yeah.  See, I grew up in the military -- 
L:  Did you?
R:  -- and so it's, like, I'm totally behind our people and our ideas --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't understand their ideas.  I don't exactly understand how, how our thoughts and feelings fit in with theirs, if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that makes any sense at all.
L:  Yeah, it does.  I don't think there is a correlation yet.  My husband tells me I just don't relate to them.  'Cause when I see it on TV I'm, like, "Why don't -- why do we have to do everything?  Can't they do anything for themselves? 
R:  Right.
L:  They, they have all the money and the oil. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  We've already spilt our blood, can't they -- 
R:  Can't they do something". 
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  Yeah.  But I guess it's --
L:  I can't see a Saddam over here.  I mean, the people would all rise up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- he said, "Well, they're born into it, that's all they know".
R:  And that's probably right.
L:  Yeah, I guess it is.
R:  Probably exactly right.
L:  It is, it's --
R:  That's all they know.
L:  I've always had it hard to understand the women over there.  I mean, the men have to sleep some time in the Middle East. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] We'd be after them here.
R:  Yeah.  But I guess your pro- husband probably hit it right on the head.  That's all they know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's been their whole entire life.
L:  Right.  They're raised in it and like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't understand all the hubbub about the museum pieces.  They don't have flushing toilets or water or electricity. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So I'd be worried about that, and food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I don't know what's gonna happen.  But I, I've always felt the Middle East was kind of bizarre and strange.
R:  It's different, yeah.
L:  Very.
R:  I know I saw on CNN one night the, um, where they were passing up a satellite -- the satellite dishes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- did you see that?
L:  No.
R:  Where some guy had, ah, bought them on the black market, I guess, a while back.  Before the war.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And now they're just, like, going crazy with these satellite dishes, everybody wants them.
L:  Oh.
R:  But now they're free to watch TV.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where they weren't even allowed to watch TV before.  And I'm like, "Oh, my gosh". 
L:  Right.  That is weird.
R:  They couldn't even watch TV. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I guess you only know what's available to you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're really lucky.
R:  Very.  Very much so.
L:  Do you listen to country and western music?
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [LAUGH] You're the first one I talked to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that said yes.  I just saw Clint Black tonight on O'Reilly Factor, and I love that song he has.  Have you heard that, Iraq and I Row?
R:  No, I don't guess I have.
L:  Do you have a computer?
R:  Is it a new song, or --
L:  Do you have a computer?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's only available on -- you go to Clint Black dot com, and it's -- ah, you download it free from his website.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's the only place it's available 'cause he doesn't have a, um, a recording contract, and it, it's real real pro troops.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And it's written from the perspective of the troops.  Like, "I'm a high tech GI Joe".  It's really a cool song.  And I saw him --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- yeah, the country and western stars have pretty much been good about it.  With a few exceptions.
R:  Yeah, I guess I haven't heard it.  I'll have to check that out.
L:  Yeah, you'll like it.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, my first conversation was with a graduate student in Washington or somewhere, and I think she was more on the liberal side. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, my first conversation with a -- was with a college student also, and he was, like, talking way over my head. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was try- trying to kind of bring him down to Earth, like, you know, welcome to the real world.
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.  Hello --
R:  Life's not -- it's not --
L:  -- you gotta work some time.
R:  Yeah, it's not all about college, and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, and your text books.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, welcome to the real world, what about, about our boys over there, you know, our --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- our sons our daughters.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- well, do you have yellow ribbons in your yard?
L:  No.
R:  Or anywhere near?
L:  No.  I'm, I'm surprised we don't.  Ah, my husband said, "When he's worked on the others parts of town that whole neighborhoods have them".
R:  Mhm.
L:  They must have someone in that neighborhood, um, overseas.  We -- I don't know why we don't.  But everybody has flags here.  We have huge flags on the street.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  And some businesses.
R:  Well, we have our -- in --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  -- our yard -- that's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was just gonna say, in our yard we have our makeshift flag.  We weren't able to get a flag because they're, like, sold out.
L:  Right.  Same here.
R:  And we, we do have a yellow ribbon, but I guess it's simply -- for me it's because my brother was over in Saudi Arabia back in ninety one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whenever it was, and that all -- it just never clicked with me, what was go- really going on.  You know, my --
L:  I don't think we had as good coverage at -- in that -- during that war.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We didn't really see it like we did this time.
R:  Yeah.  And my kids were so little back then that I guess I was concentrating on feeding the kids --
L:  You were busy.
R:  -- and getting them to day care, and so I could go to work and --
L:  That's a --
R:  -- that whole thing just never ever ever clicked with me.  Where this one has really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, -- thank God for CNN, maybe.
L:  Those kids look so young.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, sorry, what'd you say?
R:  I said I guess I just watch CNN too much nowadays, but --
L:  Yeah, we watch Fox.  My husband likes --
R:  Yeah, Fox Four.
L:  -- to watch it.  Yeah, --
R:  Yeah, we watch --
L:  -- he likes to watch Fox all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then he yells back at them, [LAUGH] he yells back at the anti war protesters.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Loud. [LAUGH] He goes, "We better not see any round here", but we haven't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I think this is a lot better equipped armed services than in -- than like the Vietnam War.
R:  Yeah.
L:  These kids seem to be --
R:  See, my dad was in the Vietnam War.
L:  Was he?  These kids seem to be so well trained, and so young to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, they're such babies.  Now see, that's what I was telling my mom -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I said, these kids -- see, I have a son that's nineteen.  But he's not in the service -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he wasn't called over there, and his name's Josh, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I told my mom, I said, "You know, this is nothing more than just a whole bunch of little Joshes". [LAUGH]
L:  I know, it's unbelievable.
R:  They're just, they're babies.
L:  And they've done really really well.
R:  But -- yes, they have.  Thank God for them -- the babies of our --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- our country.
L:  Yeah, thank God.  Well, I hope --
R:  Well --
L:  -- it all turns out okay.  I don't know if the Middle East ever will myself.  I don't see it.  I can't -- those people's philosophy on life, they're just not on the same planet. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's just so totally different, I guess, and --
L:  It is. 
R:  -- well, like we said before, it's just so totally different than anything we know.
L:  It is.
R:  It's, it's even --
L:  And I guess anything they know.
R:  It just goes beyond anything I can even understand.
L:  Ditto. [LAUGH] I don't understand it at all.  Their -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- their philosophies and that religion I don't understand, so --
R:  No, and the women walking around with the -- these big -- I don't know what you call them, capes or gowns, or --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- something. [LAUGH]
L:  Batgirls, yeah.  Yeah, that's weird.  I can see them telling us to do that, it's like, "Hello". 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Come on now. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think so. 
L:  [LAUGH] I don't think so.
R:  Number one it's too hot. [LAUGH]
L:  Way too hot.  Yeah --
R:  But you know that
