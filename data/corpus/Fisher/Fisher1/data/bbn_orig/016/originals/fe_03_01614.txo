L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Angelie[?]. 
R:  I'm Cynthia.
L:  How are you? 
R:  Good, how are you doing?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Good.  I'm, ah, calling from New York.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm calling from Philadelphia.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So the Middle East?
L:  Mhm.  Um, do you want to start?
R:  Um, [SIGH] I can start.  Um, I have very uneasy feelings on the Middle East.  I -- I very much doubt that peace is -- I mean, that a -- that a kind of constant, a continual state of peace and stability can be created at least in my lifetime or in the foreseeable future there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I lived in the Middle East for a little while.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So I guess I have -- I think when I was living there, got more and more, ah, sceptical. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what capacity were you there in?  Did you -- do you have family there or -- 
R:  Ah, I don't have -- well, I actually do have a little bit of extended family but, no, I was studying there. 
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, and I was actually studying the Palestinian Israeli conflict.
L:  Mm, wow.
R:  So, um, that meant that I ended up, you know, spending a lot [NOISE] of time thinking about the conflict. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I can imagine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, um, -- 
L:  Yeah, well, personally, I mean, I would have to agree.  Like, I just know it's -- it's been going on since basically, you know, the beginning of Israel and even before that.  You know, it's -- it's an ideological conflict so those are typically the ones that are not easily resolved, right? [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I think it's -- it's ideological and there's also a physical piece of land that's very small.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's true and I just don't feel, like, I mean, because it's someth- it's a matter of, um, it's like, you know, it deals with people's beliefs about what's theirs and what was divinely given to them, I -- I just don't see how a [NOISE] compromise could ever be made if someone feels as though the entire land belongs to them and they won't be satisfied with just, you know, a part of it.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I also think there were historical mistakes made.  I mean, I think there was an opportunity in forty eight for, um, for peace.  I mean -- 
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- there were proposals, you know, for a binational state and -- and there was some support for that, but I think I'm -- I'm more on the Israeli side, but on both sides there was also this feeling of, like, not -- there wasn't enough support behind those kinds of plans because everybody thought they could win, you know, [LAUGH] get the whole thing, and, ah, -- 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, right.
R:  And now I think, you know, the realization has been okay, you know, no one is winning and no one predictably is going to win.  I mean, you have the two largest demographics, you know, you have the rise of ultra orthodox Judaism and then you have Palestinian increase and so you have the two gr- predictably Muslim Palestinians, you know, are demographically increasing, so you have these two extreme sides that are going to get more and more demographically, so I think that in the next, you know, twenty years certainly we'll see it get a lot worse before -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there might be, you know, the potential for it to get better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- 
L:  I mean, I just feel like how can you reason with one faction of the people who feels as though Israel has never actually existed?  Like, how can you say, "Okay, well, Israel will get this land and you get this land".  It's, you know, if they're just like, well, we just -- our whole -- the whole idea of Israel is an anathema to our belief system, you know, it just seems to me like, you know, you can't compromise on people's beliefs.
R:  Well, and Palestinian state hu- likewise is -- is kind of a, um, an -- an -- a complete contradiction to what -- what most Israelis feel is their right.  I mean, um -- 
L:  But they're so willing to compromise I feel like Israel has given back so much land, you know.
R:  But there are -- there are, you know, several points on which neither side is willing to compromise.
L:  That's true.
R:  Um, and I think that no matter what, you know, those points are going to be the ones that are -- that are the deciding.  I mean, we have Jerusalem, number one.  Neither side was willing to compromise on Jerusalem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you have the, ah, return of Palestinian refugees.  Neither side is willing to compromise on that one.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, I'm trying to think what the third one, there are three big ones.  Do you know what the third one is?
L:  Um, wasn't it -- well, not the Gaza Strip, um, let's see, well, I know they gave back Sinai.
R:  Right.  Now -- now, there's a third -- there's a third point on which up to this point, it was the three that when -- when Oslo went through, their -- the whole problem [LAUGH] with Oslo was it was like, okay, you know, we're going to do this whole deal land for peace.  We're going to give back a little bit of land and you're going to get a little bit of peace and so back and forth and back and forth and then into Oslo was written that these three issues that basically no one wanted to deal with -- oh, I know what it is, it is the settlers, of course, the, um, Jewish settlers in Palestinian territory.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, and those three issues pr- were written in Oslo that they wouldn't be dealt with until later.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] Because no one wanted to deal with them but the problem is that those are the issues. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  The ones that no one can agree on and that's why in the end Oslo fell apart because, um, you couldn't -- there got to a point where you had to deal with those issues and they were becoming so problematic that you were having more and more unrest and that [inaudible] and then it was over, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I don't know.  I mean, they're talking more about peace talks but I think it's going to be interesting to see how, um, Iraq and what's going on there plays in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Um, because that's -- that's a big unknown.  I mean, it's not -- it's not that it's necessarily -- it's just -- it's a close enough part of the region that whatever happens there will affect the situation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think globally people seem to think of them being very int- maybe even more intertwined than they really are, um, but ... 
L:  Yeah.  I just -- I just find it so hard to tell, like, the Arab leaders, you know, they'll say one thing at the, um, at the diplomacy table and then turn around and, you know, just to save face in front of their people so they don't, you know, get assassinated.
R:  Right.
L:  They'll authorize ten more suicide bombings or, I don't know, yeah, it's just so hard to -- to really take what people say at face value.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I think with the suicide bombings though you have a situation where it really doesn't matter what the leadership says because all it takes is one person strapping some stuff to them. [LAUGH] 
L:  And there are fanatics on both sides.  I mean, I think that -- I mean most people, you know, whose ideology isn't that strong are -- like, they won't compromise.  People who live there don't want to, you know, live, you know, um, fearing for their lives every single day.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but it's just the fanatics who -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- who are just blinded to all reason.
R:  I mean, on both sides most people by far want to just live their lives in peace.
L:  I mean, of course, and I -- I mean, I'm definitely biased towards Israel that I -- I have to say, you know, they're -- they're -- I mean, Israel is not blameless either.  I look at, you know, Rabin got assassinated by one of his own people, you know. 
R:  Absolutely, and there had been -- I mean, you know, Is- Israel for whatever it's done is also a product of Britain's decisions.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and I think that if I look historically at what -- who's really to blame in my mind, it's more Britain than anybody else because Britain basically post World War two is like, "Oops, we're totally, you know, we're in recovery.  We just really can't deal with this situation and we don't have the -- the troops or the money to put into it, so we're just going to sort of let it go its own way now", and [LAUGH] you had wars and you had the creation of Israel.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and I think that, you know, [NOISE] Britain by taking on all its -- all its colonialist, um, [NOISE] actions, it became basically irresponsible.  At that point it was too involved to make that kind of decision.
L:  Mm.
R:  And when they made that kind of decision they basically screwed it up for everyone else because they didn't deal responsibly with the situation they had created and now the whole world is dealing with the results of that.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I think -- I mean, it's interesting because when I, um, was living there, I went with a group of people -- I -- we were -- almost all had some Jewish heritage and I h- I'm half -- half Jewish, and, um, and -- and I would say coming in we're almost all slightly more tending towards more pro Israeli just because -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- we -- that was our background and people had grown up with varying degrees of, you know, um -- 
L:  Involvement.
R:  Involvement, Young Zionists, and etcetera, etcetera.
L:  Right. 
R:  Um, and I think without exception we left pro Palestinian which, you know, it's just -- it's -- it's just one group of people, um, but I think that there is something that is really hard about actually living there and seeing the reality that, yes, it's true, you know, buses blow up, but for the vast majority of Palestinians, their -- their standard of living is so far below the Israeli standard of living.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That it's really hard, after a while, um, to -- to sympathize overly with the majority of Israelis who are living -- and, of course, there are -- there are definitely segments of Israeli society that are quite poor but, um, on the whole, Israeli living conditions are so much better, um ... 
L:  I mean, and -- I -- I definitely agree with you but, I mean, this is probably -- I just -- maybe I haven't done my research -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I just feel as though, I mean, Israel is surrounded by all of these Arab states, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  Israel is such a small piece of land and I feel as though the Palestinians are -- the majority of them are Arab, you know, and they -- they share the same ideologies as the surrounding Arab countries, so it's not as though they don't have any place to go.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, if it is a choice between their life or their homeland -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  --  then, I mean, I would just think that, you know, they would be more willing to run to accepting neighbors rather than stay and fight and lose.
R:  But see, this is the interesting thing because in fact and it's -- that's exactly what a lot of Israeli education says honestly.  I mean, that's exact in line, "Look", you know, "We're a small country, we're surrounded by this Arab" which is true, certainly, I mean, geographically.
L:  Mm.
R:  But in fact the Palestinian people that have gone to surrounding countries have been treated basically you could say it's a form of racism and --
