L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name's Cathy.
R:  Hi.  My name is Ankoor[?] and I'm a student at Penn State.
L:  Oh, great, yeah.  I'm in Massachusetts.  I'm -- I'm older, I'm not a student. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's okay.
L:  Oh, so, what do you think about everything going on in the Middle East?
R:  Um, well, I actually can give an international perspective, you know.  I'm an international student from India and I'm doing my MBA here.
L:  Ahah.
R:  So, the opinion I -- what I feel about the Middle East is that it's probably a legacy of the past, like what the British left behind and they probably left it for the US to sort it out.
L:  Right.  That's probably true.
R:  Because the British just left in a haphazard way, drawing arbitrary lines and I think it's just a question of, you know, being trying to incite religious sentiments because they want to get back at Israel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think that's, uh, that's -- I don't think that's a valid reason for going after the Israelis -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- uh, because I think everybody's entitled to his or their homeland.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  You're probably right. 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, what do you feel about it?
L:  I've a -- I -- well, I kind of feel the same way.  I feel like, you know, that I don't really think there will ever be peace in the Middle East because, like you said, too many people are trying to butt in and change other people's ways.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they -- a lot of people don't want to be bothered, you know, they want to stay with the way they are -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, so I don't think there's really ever going to be peace, because -- 
R:  It's going -- 
L:  -- you're always going to have people that want to step in and change it.
R:  Yeah.  It's going to be tough.  I mean, probably there can be peace but for that everybody, the Israelis as -- as well as the Arab world, they probably have to make so many concessions that -- which probably neither -- neither of the sides are willing to make. 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  We faced the same situation back home in India, like, we have fought three wars with Pakistan over Kashmir, which is essentially the same issue of land -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and, um, I don't see any way that we can resolve it because there is too much ego at stake.  People don't look at the big picture, they only look at, you know, like ego of nationalistic feelings, like, "Will we win the next election if we take this step?" 
L:  Right.  Right.  I think a lot of has to do with politics, too.
R:  It's -- it's too short sighted, that's what I feel.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  And plus the US has -- [MN] I mean, being the only superpower left in the world, you know, it- it's difficult because they have to take that step because, as you saw on September eleventh what happened -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- this -- these things will keep on happening if the US does not take a, you know, positive route.  I mean, President Bush I think has been unfairly criticized for having taken extreme measures as like going after Iraq, but, I mean, if you've got a choice between seeing your own countrymen die and seeing somebody else's countrymen die, I think it preferable for the other people to die, because you don't want your own country to be at danger all the time.
L:  True.  True.
R:  It's -- I see it as simple as that.  I mean I am from India -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I am -- I mean I don't -- I can't take sides.  I mean, I'm here in the US studying.  It's not that I'm saying this, I'm pro US just because I'm here, but I think if I was [several inaudible words] India, I would do the same thing.  I mean, I would attack the other country [inaudible] having seen -- having seen my people die.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, what happened on September eleventh was huge.
L:  Right.  Right.  Something had to be done.
R:  Yes, something had to be done.
L:  If you think [inaudible] something that you can just ignore and say, "Well, you know, it happened and m- maybe something else is going to happen but we don't know and we're not going to do anything", you know.  You have to do -- you have to do something and, like you said, you know, President Bush has been criticized but really what choice does he have?
R:  He doesn't have many -- a lot of choice and that's what, uh, I think -- the Americans I think, [inaudible] the public, the American public at least understands that.  I mean I just go by the support that he has by CNN and all the Gallup polls that they keep on doing, so I -- that's kind of -- I think that should be heartening for them, that at least the American public is supporting him.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And the second issue is probably -- I think the bigger one was the oil that's there, which is important for the world -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And that's a very big issue and I wouldn't fault, again I wouldn't fault President Bush for going after the oil.  I mean, it's -- it's a resource full of oil and somebody got to make use of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH] It's there if you need it.
R:  Because people just -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people just think that, you know, it's, uh, it's just economic and nothing else, but it's gone far beyond economics now when you see so many people die.
L:  Oh, right.  Right.  Yeah.  I think we'll probably be over there for quite a long time just straightening everything out.
R:  Well, I think they should be there for a longer time just so that this [inaudible] doesn't flare up again -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, as you are seeing in Afghanistan, the US is not completely out of it, but they are probably handing it over power a bit too early to the Afghanis and [inaudible] problems and, you know, controlling their own people.
L:  Right.
R:  So, probably the US should -- should stay there in Iraq a little longer -- 
L:  Yes, I think so.
R:  -- and ensure -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ensure that elections are held. [COUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  I think -- I think they'll have to be over there quite a long time, really, at least -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, some, maybe not so many troops, but some of them are going to have to stay there to wait until everything calms down and, like you said, get the elections going and everything straightened out.
R:  Yeah, because you don't want to send your troops again to a place like Iraq.  
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I mean, people have lost focus of the world just because they think that everything is [inaudible], all so hunky dory, but I think there's still some grave danger to the troops out there.
L:  Right.  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Well, I don't know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  What else is there to talk about on this subject, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I mean, that's what they want us to talk about, just talk about the Middle East.
L:  I -- I know.  I -- oh -- I feel, you know, they did a good job going over there and doing what they did.  I think we did the right thing.  I don't think -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- we really had any choice.
R:  Yeah.  And I think the key to the Middle East, I mean the pr- -- the peace or whatever President Bush is striving for, it probably lies in the hands of the Israelis more than himself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean it's probably going to take a lot of convincing on the part of, uh, you know, like going after the Israelis and making them make some huge concessions because they are the ones who really have to make the sacrifices if they want to see lasting peace.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that's why the contribution of President Rabin would have been critical had he been alive today -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but unfortunately [LAUGH] that's the way things go.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It just takes a bullet to, you know, just delay the whole process.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH].  Oh.
R:  I guess we have another two minutes to go. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] oh, you were timing.  I didn't time it. [LAUGH]
R:  Pardon me?  
L:  I -- 
R:  No, I just -- I --  
L:  Were you timing it?  I didn't -- I didn't look at the clock so I didn't know what time it was.
R:  Yeah, I just saw the clock as when it started, so ...
L:  Mm. [MN] No, it's funny because ten minutes is, like, -- is, like, a long time. [MN] After you finish what you want to say, then it's like, "Mhm, [LAUGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- what else do we need to say?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH].  Yeah.  I mean you -- it's -- it's probably saying the same things again and again.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, you know ... 
L:  Yeah.  Well -- 
R:  Like, but the thing is the Middle East has changed.  I mean September the eleventh has changed a lot of things for so many people.  You know, I have so many international, like, people from the Suez and the Middle East who are probably being treated unfairly, but, you know, what happened was not normal and so the consequences of that are not going to be normal.  [MN] I have a friend who is from Lebanon and, uh, he has had to, like, go for finger printing and he has to go to the FBI probably every three months -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and so -- I mean there is some discrimination, but again those people, those nineteen people who committed those horrendous acts, they weren't thinking of all the people that would be affected by it.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, you know, I -- 
L:  I know.  That's what's amazing is how many people in the United States were affected by that that, you know, had nothing to do with it and it affected their whole life. 
R:  It has.  It has.  I mean definitely it's due --
L:  Affected everybody's life, I guess.
R:  Ha.  In some way or the other it has -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- least of all the people who lost their near and dear ones.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean even business or politics or students, I mean every walk of life has been affected in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some way or the other.  I mean take a simple thing as us travelling.  You probably had gone for Easter somewhere and you'd -- you'd think twice about [several inaudible words] I better just drive.
L:  Right.  
R:  You know?
L:  Right.  I know.
R:  It's much safer driving -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- because you never know who the next maniac is going to be out there -- 
L:  Exact- -- 
R:  -- who is going to bomb the plane.
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  So.  Things have been changed ir- irrevocably -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's going to be some time before things get back to pre September eleventh, which I doubt they will ever get back to.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's the sad part.  I don't think it will ever be back to the, you know, [MN] everybody will always have some fear of other people or, like you said, if you are flying not knowing if it's safe, you know.
R:  [SIGH] [several inaudible words] I think that's taking a lot of, uh, toil on the psyche of the common man because -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I saw -- I was seeing these, uh, interviews on, uh, CNN I think and they were just showing this, uh, crowd, the workday crowd walking up to their offices and everybody was like, "I don't know what's in store for me because I never know if somebody is going to bomb my office today".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that -- that [several inaudible words] that says quite a lot about the fear that people have nowadays.  I mean as simple as them going to do grocery shopping or, you know, -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- going for a walk.  You don't know whether there is going to be a bullet whizzing by your ear. [MN]
L:  Right. 
R:  There is such a sense of, uh, you know, panic in the common man that something is going to give and things are not the way they were and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the world has become a lot more unsafe than it was.
L:  But it's almost like you just have to, you know, you can't worry about that, you know.  If something's going to happen, it's going to happen.  There's --
