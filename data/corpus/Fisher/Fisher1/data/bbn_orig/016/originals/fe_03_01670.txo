L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Yes, my name is Jim.
L:  Hi, my name is Hylan[?].
R:  Is what?
L:  Hylan.
R:  Hylan?  Hi, how you doing?
L:  I'm good.  And you?
R:  I'm all right, thanks.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Okay, so we're supposed to -- if I understand this correctly, we're supposed to discuss the Middle East or -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you comfortable with the topic?
R:  Yeah, yeah, totally.  I'm just -- I'm just trying to -- I got this email the other night from a friend about this and I'm just trying to understand the parameters of, ah, -- what they want us to discuss, because it's a pretty big topic.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, uh, -- 
L:  It's a very serious topic, I guess.  I think so.  Mm.  
R:  So, uh, -- 
L:  So what do you think? 
R:  Any -- anything you -- you'd like to begin with or toss out there, or ... 
L:  Um, what -- what do you think about this whole thing? 
R:  Um, it's actually something I'm having a lot of trouble with, trying to sort it all out.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  Um, I wish I were a lot more familiar with the history of the region than I am.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Basically I think, um, ... I haven't always been entirely, uh, -- I haven't always been entirely confident in our decisions as far as, uh, supporting Israel goes -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and how that supports the peace process -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- and I can understand why, um, ... I think -- I think there definitely are some legitimate grievances -- 
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, coming from over there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at the same time there's a very, um, there's a very -- obviously a very fanatical, um, intolerant -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, fact- -- you know, to say the least, faction within the, uh, Muslim world, a legitimate threat that we have, uh, to protect ourselves against because -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, they're not -- they're not going to stop until -- and -- I'm -- I'm talking about for instance, uh, groups like Hamas, uh, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Hezbollah, uh, al Qaeda, whatever.  They're not going to stop until -- they're going to keep fighting, they are not going to stop until either they're dead or they've inflicted lots of damage over there.  That's just the -- and that's -- that climate is constantly supported by the, uh, the culture of, uh, death over there -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- within Islamic fundamentalism as far as, um, promises of martyrdom, uh, children basic- basically being raised -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- with the expect-  with the, um, expectation that they will -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go out and -- and --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and die by killing themselves and meanwhile -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- uh, killing lots of other people, whether -- whether they be Israelis or -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or Americans or whatever.
L:  Right.  I think there's so much hatred in that area.  Um, I'm not sure that, uh, all countries should support Israel completely because I think things -- tha- that land is not com- -- I mean maybe in history that belonged to Israel, but that -- I mean those people have been living there for so long and if you just by law or by rule you just get them out, how can you say it's fair or something like that?
R:  Yeah.  Act- [MN] -- because I, um, I was reading something about the, uh -- thi- this was actually a program I was watching on TV -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- where the, um, the attitude of prominent Zionists were -- was that, "Well, the Arabs, they have, if you look at the entire region, they have all this land. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  We just, we just want this little area" -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is kind of -- it's been buttressed by American foreign policy as well -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but that doesn't change the fact that people are living there -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're getting -- they're getting uprooted, they're getting pushed out of their homes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The ones that -- the ones that are still there, they're having, uh, their own land flooded with, uh, with settlers from all over the world -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who happen to, um, -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- claim the same, um, for our purposes, religious identity -- 
L:  Right.  
R:  -- and -- 
L:  Just imagine that, for example, if a part of -- a part of the United States like New York, um, it belongs to some people in the ancient times and now they want to come back were America just to say, "Yeah, you can come back.  I will give --" 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you this land".  I think it would be so hard to make this decision.  I mean --" 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, so I think, uh-hum, the problem is if you fight with your enemy, you're going to die too.  Your enemy is going to die and you're going to die, too.
R:  Mm.
L:  You just should get ready to -- to dig out two graves -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for both you and your enemy.  I think the thing is to find some peace in that area, not by armed forces but try to think of some other ways to get it done, because if you use armed forces there is no way that there's going to be peace there.  Maybe by force temporarily for ten years or at most for ten, twenty years or thirty years, but the problem is still there.
R:  Yeah, and that's -- and the unfortunate thing is bec- because obviously any- anyone of good faith will realise that, uh, there's, you know, there's -- there's good people and there's -- there's bad people on either side of the, um, on either side, and that there -- 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- there -- there are -- there are people in the -- there -- I mean there are factions in the Arab world, [MN] progressive factions who really want a -- a peaceful solution as -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- as there are factions -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the Israeli -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- um, coming from the Israeli community, but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think those voices are not only being drowned out but I think ignored as far as, um, mainstream media -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- coverage goes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, because there -- there -- I mean there -- there are Israelis that are -- and a lot of, um, a lot of American Jews as well who are obviously -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- very critical of, um, of Israel's territorial expansion.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In fact, historically some of the most, um, outspoken opponents of Zionism were --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, were Jews themselves.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.
R:  But, um, ...  
L:  Right. [SIGH] I know.  It --
R:  And I -- I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm sorry, I know I'm probably going off on a bunch of tangents here.  It's a -- it's a very large, um, topic with a lot of areas to, um, -- 
L:  It's -- it's too large. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  I don't think we can finish in ten minutes, but, anyway, I just wish that, um, there -- there's a better choice than using weapons, but I know it's almost -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- impossible -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at this time.
R:  Yeah, I wish there were, too, it's just I -- I don't see it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't see it happening.
L:  Mhm.  And I hope United States is not becoming another Israel.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I'm just hoping -- 
R:  Say again?
L:  -- U- United States is not becoming another Israel, um, because of the terrorist attacks or ... 
R:  I -- I sure hope not.
L:  I hope -- I hope -- I hope our country will adopt more peaceful policies with other countries and even though we don't agree with their policies, we try not to, um, disagree too much because that will in some way damage our own land, eventually.
R:  Yeah.  I mean it's -- it's -- it's another thing to, uh, -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to keep in mind our -- or what our -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- as far as the -- as far as our current administration goes, what are our -- our true motives over there. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I want to, um, -- I like to think it's a lot more reasonable than [MN] criticisms from the far left that say, "Oh, it's, um, -- oh, it's just -- just for oil" and I [MN] I'd like to think it's a lot more, um, complex than that, but -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I agree.
R:  -- honestly, I don't -- I don't trust the, uh, President Bush.  I seriously doubt his, uh, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- his motives there.  Like, [MN] I think as far -- as far as -- and now we're kind of spilling over into, uh, Iraq, but as far as, uh, our agenda there, it seems like freeing, uh, the Iraqi people from, you -- you know, Saddam Hussein's tyranny was really kind of a footnote -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as why we're going over there.
L:  Ahah.  Mhm.
R:  First it was, um -- first it was the weapons of mass destruction which, uh, whether he does -- whether he does have them or not --
