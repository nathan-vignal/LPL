R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Fine.
L:  Where are you at?
R:  Orlando.
L:  Oh, I'm in Vancouver, Washington.
R:  Oh, you sounded like my aunt for a minute.  I was like, "Huh?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wh- what was the topic?  I could not barely hear her.
L:  Um, the, um, ah, the things that are going --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the Middle East, will there ever be peace or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whether --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, the US should stay involved with, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is that your dog?
R:  Yeah, I'm about to go. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm smoking a cigarette outside.  I'm going to go in the front yard.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Give me a second.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think --
L:  So, have you done one of these before?
R:  Yeah, I done one, [MN] um, about computer games. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.  So we just have to talk for ten minutes?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I -- I already got my check.  It took a while though.
L:  Oh, really?  Was that very long ago?
R:  Um, [MN] I just got it, like, a few days ago.
L:  Oh.
R:  Took about a few weeks.
L:  How long ago did you do your first phone call?
R:  A few weeks ago.
L:  Oh, well [NOISE] that's not bad.
R:  No ...  Okay, well let's got in this topic thing.  They --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- say you have to talk on the topic.  Um ...
L:  [LIPSMACK] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you think about peace in the Middle East?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think it's their problem and not ours --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- honestly.
L:  Yeah, kind of I do too.  I don't know why we have to get involved in everything.
R:  I think we just want their oil.
L:  You think so?
R:  Yes, that's what I think. [LAUGH]
L:  You're probably right.  That's what my husband says.
R:  But if -- if they really wanted peace over there we wouldn't be over there killing their people.
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  [NOISE] So ... [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  No.
R:  And my friend just got shipped off, which he's in the chemical department.  [NOISE] They had him in, um, in -- over in Georgia for a few months.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But he just got shipped off on Friday so obviously they think there's chemicals over there now.
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] So as long as they don't come over here --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or do any more terrorist attacks over here, I'm fine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] So, um ... [MN] 
R:  So, what do you think of it? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't -- I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just don't know what to think.  I think we -- we bet in too much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, in things that aren't our business.
R:  They should've gave us a better topic.
L:  I don't know why -- why it's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we feel like we have to be the babysitters of the whole world or something.
R:  They should've gave us a toci- topic about them saying that they killed -- tha- that guy killed, um, his wife --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- and their baby.
L:  That is so weird.
R:  They should've gave us that topic.
L:  Yeah, maybe next time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, I don't know.  I -- it is hard to say about that.
R:  How much longer do you think the war's going to last?
L:  What?
R:  How much longer do you think the war's going to last?
L:  Ah, well, I bet we'll have troops there for at least a couple of years.
R:  That long, you think?
L:  I think so, just helping to keep the peace.  I mean, look, they've been in Afghanistan already for, what, a year and a half?
R:  [LIPSMACK] See, I don't think it's right that, um -- I just forgot. [LAUGH] [PAUSE] Oh, I don't think it's right that we're going to have to restore Iraq --
L:  Well, no, it's --
R:  -- out of our money.
L:  No.  [MN] No, we've spent --
R:  And our gas prices went up and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think that's right.
L:  No.
R:  I think they should have to do all that.  They have all the oil over there, they should be restoring everything.
L:  Well, that's what they said.  They want to start selling it so they can have the money to --
R:  They -- they need to actually -- they need to take all of that stuff that Saddam has --
L:  Mhm.
R:  All of his personals and all of that, and sell it and use that money.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Instead of having us ship over our money.
L:  That- that's very true.  They should do that.
R:  And they should take some o- some of that money and split it through all the people that they sent over there to fight.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I agree with you.
R:  They should do that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they probably won't 'cause they're greedy.  And I don't like Bush either.
L:  Oh, I don't either.
R:  He seems like a --
L:  We called him --
R:  -- real wussy.
L:  -- a war monger before he ever got elected.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Said he was -- you know, we were going to be at war within a year of him being elected and [MN] here we were in Afghanistan [LAUGH] --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- ten months later.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] So, [MN] anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause of views. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  The views.  We've already went over that and we have to talk for ten minutes about that.
L:  Really, the same subject?
R:  Yep, we have to stay on the subject.
L:  Do they listen to what we say?
R:  Yeah, they record it.
L:  And then they listen to it later and ...?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, wow.  [inaudible] should talk then about that.
R:  [LAUGH] And that's how you get paid which actually I just got a thing, um, [MN] you can refer people and get a dollar for each person you refer.
L:  Yeah, I just got that today too.  Well, I just signed up like Friday or Saturday.
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  And I didn't expect to get a call this soon.
R:  [MN] Well, I actually just called in.  You can call in for a phone call, that's what I just did.
L:  Oh.
R:  I called in 'cause I haven't --
L:  Well, you're my first.
R:  I -- I haven't had a phone call in a while -- [MN] 
L:  Oh.
R:  So I was like, well, ah, you can get three phone calls so I called in today.
L:  Oh, yeah. [MN] 
R:  Can use some more shucks. [MN] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yep.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, um, [LIPSMACK] I wonder h- how do they expect us to talk for ten minutes [LAUGH] on the Middle East?
R:  I know, about that one topic.
L:  I'm not that [MN] -- I'm not that, um, sophisticatedly educated or whatever.
R:  Or that.  [LAUGH] So what have you seen on the news about that topic? [LAUGH]
L:  On the news?  Um, [MN] that they're still looking for all the -- the -- all of Saddam's, you know, head guys and ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think they're in Syria? [MN]
R:  I don't know.
L:  That's what my husband was saying weeks ago.  He's, um, [LIPSMACK] he's studied a lot more on world history than most of us Americans.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's from England and he thinks they're in Syria.  He was saying that long before they ever said that on the news.  He said, "Saddam's in Syria".  [MN] I don't know, I just hope --
R:  They just need to find him and --
L:  And I hope they find him and they find --
R:  And kill him before they come over here and start doing stuff over here.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] And find Osama too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Before he sends more terrorists over here.
R:  Yup.  Th- well, ther- there's already like plenty of terrorists over here.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Ah, you can guarantee that.  They're probably just waiting for the word to s- before they start striking and doing stuff over here.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] I he- --
R:  I heard that they're -- they're watching, like, a few people that they have suspects over here.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I think like over in Miami or something.  But ...
L:  Wow. 
R:  [NOISE] Oh well.  But they -- they need to take all of Saddam's stuff and sell it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I saw like a whole bunch of pictures, like inside his palace and all that stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Instead of destroying his palace, take the stuff and sell it.
L:  Yeah, everything's --
R:  And then use that money, use his money to restore.
L:  Yep.  [MN] Well, it wasn't his to begin with.  It was the people of Iraq's money.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but still.  And then you saw on the news that there was, um, like a whole warehouse fill -- full of, like, dead people?
L:  Yes.  [MN] Wasn't that horrible?
R:  It's all the people he killed.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] And they were showing today on the news a, um, a cemetery where they had -- they had murdered a lot of the people that they had imprisoned.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, political prisoners.  They'd murdered 'em and buried 'em and [MN] the families were just now finding out.  They thought they were still in prison and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- found out that they'd been killed and buried in this cemetery.  And they didn't have names on 'em, they just had numbers on these little wooden sticks on each plot.  [MN] So they had to go by a list and find out what number they were. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] He killed a lot of people.
R:  Oh, what'd I do with my pack of cigarettes?
L:  His own people.
R:  [NOISE] I lost my pack of cigarettes. [LAUGH]
L:  What?
R:  I lost my pack of cigarettes.
L:  Oh no.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know where I put it.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Da, da, da, da, da.  It's gone. [SIGH]
L:  But do you have any relatives? [MN]
R:  Over there? 
L:  Over -- yeah, right.
R:  No, I have, um, my best friend that just got shipped over.
L:  Yeah?
R:  On Friday.
L:  A guy or a girl?
R:  A guy.
L:  A guy, yeah?
R:  And he's married and he has three kids. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that must be hard on his wife.
R:  [NOISE] Well, his wife is a cheater.
L:  Oh no.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, she's cheated on him plenty of times when he's been sent away. [MN] 
L:  Oh, that's not nice.
R:  So she has -- he has somebody watching her or something. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's terrible.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  That's not a very good wife.  My brother had that same problem too.  He was -- he's in the N- -- well, he was in the Navy.  He's out now but [MN] -- thank goodness.  He was over there at the first Gulf War. [MN]
R:  My, um -- well, this lady I work with, her daughter, she's, what, twenty two, twenty three.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she actually enrolled for the Navy just to get education and everything.  [LAUGH] She wasn't expecting to get shipped away but she got shipped away.
L:  [MN] Oh my goodness.
R:  Yep.
L:  Well, it's not even safe to be in the reserves any more now. [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Used to be just a weekend warrior job but now [MN] a lot of 'em have been sent over.
R:  Yeah, I don't think it's right that they're sending over our [NOISE] people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They need to take all of the -- the immigrants and everything [NOISE] out of the US and just ship 'em back.  What, baby? [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] My husband says they should take --
R:  Ah, don't pull my pants.
L:  -- take all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the young people that are in prison, you know, all the young guys and stuff and --
R:  And send them over. [LAUGH]
L:  -- send them over.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Especially the ones who are -- have shot or killed people.  They think they know how to handle guns, send 'em over there.
R:  Mhm.  Get them outta here. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  That'll save us money. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we don't have to feed and clothe 'em over here.  We can send 'em over there and they can fight the war.
R:  It's not like they really feed 'em or clothe 'em too much. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [MN] But [SIGH] [inaudible].
R:  How many minutes has it been?
L:  Yeah?
R:  [NOISE] Has it been ten yet? [LAUGH]
L:  Almost.  I think it's --
R:  Well, the last phone call was on -- we didn't talk until they said to stop.  [NOISE] We just did the conversation and we just ended it and I still got paid.  So I don't know how that worked.
L:  Yeah?  What was your subject last time?
R:  Computer games. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's right, you said that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't play any computer
