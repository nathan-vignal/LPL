L:  Hello. 
R:  Hi.  This is John calling from Boston.
L:  Hi.  I'm Christina and I'm calling from New York.
R:  Hi, Christina.  So what do you think of today's topic? 
L:  [LAUGH] I've never done this before, um, so I guess it's -- it's kind of interesting.
R:  It sure is.  I -- I think the Middle East is a very broad, um, very, very broad subject and I've been -- I have, um, many years in the military so I- I'm probably going to be a little biased on the whole thing right now.
L:  Yeah.  Actually, I think you may even compensate for some of my lack of knowledge.  Um, at first when -- when, uh, the US first entered into conflict over in the Middle East, uh, I was following the news and really staying abreast of a lot of different things, but as time has passed I haven't really stayed as up to date on it as I probably should have but, um, I'm sure you probably have done that, especially with your background.
R:  I -- I have but, I'm -- I, you know, I -- I think it's one of those, um, you know, everything from my -- my religious upbringing as a Catholic as a -- as a child, you -- I -- I've thought about it, but it's -- it's -- I -- I think peace is, um, possible there, I think it's going to take time, I think it's going to take many, um, many, many years with, um, with us helping out.  Uh, I don't think we can stay out of there.  I think it is truly a world economy now and there's a lot of people over there without jobs and I think that's probably, um, the biggest problem that we have in the Middle East.
L:  Yeah.  I think I tend to agree with you, although I don't know that I really believe that peace is possible over there, especially with the alliance the US has with Israel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How do you think that your military background has affected your opinions?  
R:  Wha- -- 
L:  I mean, what -- what is your military background, I guess.
R:  [COUGH] Oh, I -- I've [MN] about twenty two years in the military.
L:  Oh, wow! 
R:  You know, everything from a tank commander, uh, -- 
L:  The army, I guess?
R:  Army, right.
L:  Ahah. 
R:  And always enlisted.  I've been over to the Middle East a couple of times.
L:  Wow! 
R:  And I've never, um, -- y- y- you know, I think they're people just like us and I think given the right opportunity, um, I -- I think peace is possible.  I -- I, you know, I was stationed, my first duty assignment was, uh, on the East German border facing the Russians and, you know, I used to have, um, people tell me that, uh, you know, they -- they said, "You're going to take your grandchildren back --" 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you're still going to be looking at that wall" and that's gone --" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and I was afraid of them.
L:  Yeah, and I guess anything is possible after you experience it yourself first hand.  I don't know. [MN] It's just -- it's hard to believe that there's so much going on over there and I believe that there's probably misinformation on both sides.  Uh, I don't know if you saw any of that [MN] minister of information and how, you know, it almost seemed ridiculous -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- what he was saying on TV.
R:  Yeah, Bag- Baghdad Bob.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] You know, I wonder how much of that you can look at on our side, too, and say, "Well, it's so ridiculous, it's not even the truth".  I mean you wonder what to believe [MN] and -- and that's kind of what made me turn off the TV and just stop listening to a lot.  You know, I'll read an article here and there, but I -- I just -- uh, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
R:  True.  I had, uh, Easter dinner with my father yesterday and -- and he's very much, uh, anti war, we shouldn't be there type of thing, heh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I, you know -- 
L:  So was it controversy at the dinner table?
R:  V- very much so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You -- you know, and -- and he kept saying, "We haven't found any weapons of mass destruction" and I said, "Well, Spielberg isn't done making them yet". [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yes, you never know.  I mean, even if we hear that they did find them.  See, I don't -- I don't know what I believe.  Even if they tell us that they did find them or didn't find them, [MN] you know, they do have to keep certain information confidential, too.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  So I don't really -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I -- I take in the information but I find it really hard to -- to -- I guess define what my opinion is because I don't know what the truth is and what the truth isn't.  So, although I do think that we should be there.  I think that there is definitely a need for US presence there at this time.
R:  Right.  I -- I think yes, but it is very dangerous and I have to, um, -- I -- I -- I think if there -- um, a lot of the people from the Middle East, they can't fight conventionally now.  We've got -- we've got so overwhelming technological superiority, um, they're going to find other ways to fight and we look at it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as barbarism.
L:  It's almost they have to.
R:  Right.  We look at it as barbarism for somebody to, uh, you know, uh, convince a kid to strap a bomb to themselves and go into a place.
L:  But it is almost as though what alternatives do they have.
R:  Right.
L:  They have to resort to almost anything.  With our technology and the number of our troops also, you can't forget about that.  I mean we outnumber them -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- vastly.
R:  And if I was on the other side, you know, how would I be fighting -- 
L:  Mhm, yeah, but it -- 
R:  -- you know, is the other question. 
L:  But I guess with your background again you probably can consider a lot of points that I can't.  Um, you said you've been enlisted for over twenty two years now?
R:  Yeah, well, national gar- -- between the national guard and -- and regular army. 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  You know, I travelled quite extensively all over the world and things like this, but, uh, you know, I wasn't -- everybody -- it seems like everyone you talk to now was, y- -- was, you know, Sergeant York and -- and were fighting and stuff like this.  I -- I never liked firing my gun [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and I -- I probably was, if anything, an average soldier -- 
L:  Ahah. 
R:  -- not -- not any more, not any less.  I was more on the technical side of things.  I didn't like the whole running around in the woods and -- and firing guns and things like that, weapons.
L:  I mean I guess you probably have people on both ends, but what's your training like when you go through something like that?  I mean, um, with this project it sounds like they tried to be very, very humanitarian.  Do you think that that's how they are just in general or do you think that that's something they are trying to -- to portray more heavily on the news as, you know, the image of the US troops just because [MN] the rest of the world was sort of against US involvement? 
R:  Well, I -- I think Americans -- and, you know, I've looked at it from World War Two and -- and, you know, I was stationed over in Germany and I -- and I was, um, worked with a couple of guys who were there in Frankfurt when we bombed ninety seven per cent of Frankfurt into dust and he- he said, "You know, the -- we were afraid of the Americans.  One day you're fighting us and the next day you're feeding us" -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it's -- it's a very -- Americans have always been that way, um, you know, I -- I don't think as a people we hold grudges like other people.  That's why I think we look at the Middle East and we see, um, we see some of these conflicts that go on for centuries.
L:  Yeah, but they're religious conflicts basically.
R:  They're religious conflicts.
L:  And I think in the US with our separation of church and state, I mean everybody has the freedom to do what they want and religion is supposed to be set aside when it comes to government affairs -- 
R:  Yeah.  I [inaudible] --
L:  -- and over there it's -- it's not like that.
R:  But they look at u- -- they look at this as a religious where they look at it as Islam versus Christian -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to some extent and -- and -- and, you know, I think it's not Islam versus Christian, it's modern versus the -- the old way versus the new way and the haves versus the have nots.  We have more -- it -- it's -- it's just we get paid more in a month than most of these people make in a year -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- easily.
L:  Do -- do they hold it against us?
R:  Yes.  They --
L:  Because we are more fortunate just to be here in an economy that's stronger and more resilient?
R:  Yes.  They see our movies and things like this and everything isn't like the movies.  I try to -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- tell people, "You don't get a parking spot out in front of everything and [MN] and high school kids driving Mercedes convertibles and things like that".
L:  It's not the norm.
R:  No, it's not. [NOISE]
L:  But they -- that's what they perceive -- 
R:  That's what they perceive.
L:  -- this culture as what's portrayed in movies?
R:  Yes.
L:  Wow.
R:  And -- and we're exporting.  Remember our biggest export is -- is our -- is our movies and our -- our culture, our television and they're seeing that and they're seeing a very, very distorted view of us and everybody thinks that we're -- we're -- we're very different, it's not just the Middle East, and when you don't have a job and -- and you're -- if you look around there, there's not much there and there's not a chance to grow an economy there and their population rates are huge.  There are a lot of people in the Middle East, um, -- 
L:  Well, do they believe the -- I mean, you know how we see propaganda on TV where, you know, uh, uh, a US cameraman and person from the TV station is over there and as soon as you flick on the camera, you know, there are millions of US flags burning and tonnes of pictures of our -- whoever our president is at the time but, you know, like burned and shredded and everything else.  Is it really like that over there?  I mean, do they really hate the US and think that, you know, we are like the bane of all evil?
R:  Some do.  There's -- there's -- like anything, there's -- there's a -- I would say twenty per cent hate us, twenty per cent love of us and the -- and the sixty per cent in the middle is what we're fighting for, is -- is get the hearts and minds of those people, but then there's the other thing.  Many of these people want to come to the United States and we put up such restrictions on people coming to the United States -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- now, and it's -- it's impossible so it's -- it's tough for them to be able to do anything.
L:  And I guess that that just encourages disgust among the people and, you know, that makes them not like us again for something different.  You know, if they --
R:  Right, and remember it's like talking with someone who is brought up very religiously.  Have you ever met anyone in the United States and they are super religious -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's hard getting anything through. 
L:  Very fervent. 
R:  Yes.  I sit on the train and I sit next to a guy every day and -- and he -- he has the Bible and he sits there and he reads the Bible and he's -- and he's always trying to push it on me.
L:  Like a fundamentalist type?
R:  Oh, yeah, and y- you know, he is asking me every morning, "Have you found Jesus yet?" 
L:  Oh, my gosh, and you sit next to this guy every day?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, because the train is always crowded and he always sits next to me because -- and, you know, I don't mind, he can sit there and read his Bible all he w- -- he wants -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I don't need to hear pushing it on me, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and telling -- making assumptions --
