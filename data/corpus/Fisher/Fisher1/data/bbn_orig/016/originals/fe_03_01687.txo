L:  Hello, my name's Beverley.
R:  Hey, Beverley.  My name is Matt.  How are you?
L:  Oh, pretty good.  How are you doing?
R:  Good.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Indiana.
R:  All right, whereabouts?
L:  Uh, s- southern Indiana, right across the river from Louisville, Kentucky.
R:  All right.  I'm in, uh, in, New Jersey actually.
L:  Really?
R:  Midland Park, in Burden County.
L:  Really?  You don't have a New Jersey accent I'm used to hearing. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm actually from New York, and I -- I don't think I have a New York accent either.
L:  I don't think so either. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Amazing, right?
L:  I would have picked you to be more in the middle ea- -- uh, in the mid west.
R:  Oh, well, then I guess that's good.
L:  Yeah, I think so too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Oh, so we're supposed to be discussing the Middle East, huh?
R:  I guess so.
L:  Okay, well.
R:  So I would guess that you, uh, if -- if I was going to stereotype the mid west I would say you -- you -- you've supported the, uh, Bush initiative.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  No, I do not. 
R:  I -- I -- I would be incorrect?
L:  Yes, you would.  I did not --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- I do not -- I support the troops, but I do not support the President or his reasons for going over there.
R:  Wow.
L:  So --
R:  Are -- do you find that you're in a minority?
L:  Oh yes, and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- work for the federal government, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I am -- I am definitely in the minority. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  And is your -- is your perspective informed by where you work, you know, do you have information that others may not?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  Um, [SIGH] actually, no, it doesn't -- it isn't influenced by my work at all because, how shall I explain this?  I feel like because I work for the federal government I am expected not to have an opinion of my own, but to agree with whatever the administration is doing at the time.
R:  Right.
L:  So I feel like, at times, my first amendment rights of free speech are limited at work.
R:  At work?  So, in other words, you -- you couldn't send an email during work expressing a political opinion?
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  I have f- -- if I like to keep my job, I wouldn't. [LAUGH] 
R:  But can I ask where -- where do you work?
L:  I work for the Census Bureau.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, so I -- I'm on the phone every night with people from all over the country and there's a lot of pe- -- there's a lot of angry people out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a -- a lot of them just simply won't talk to me because I'm with the government.  But, I mean, I'm -- I'm not angry like a lot of these people are ag- a- against what they're doing.  In a sense I can agree with it, [SIGH] I just think a lot -- there's more hidden agenda on us going over there than what the administration is making us lead -- led to believe.
R:  Yes.  I'm, like, my opinion about the whole thing is that I think that Bush and the administration, they're -- they're right for the wrong reasons.  I think that, you know, I support what we're doing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If, for no other reason, than we're in the long run saving thousands of lives and -- and making, you know, the Iraqi people's lives better --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no matter what the intentions are of the administration.  I think they're wrong on just about everything.  I think Bush is a moron.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think, uh, his economic policy is, uh, pretty deceitful, um --
L:  They are, I agree with that.
R:  You know, I think it's pretty -- you know, I -- I -- I think basically it's, you know, administration that's hell bent on crony capitalism and kind of, you know, feeding the --
L:  [SIGH] Well, I'm --
R:  -- the mouths of a very few rich people.  But I -- I think --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- I think he happens to be right for the wrong reason a- and, you know --
L:  [SIGH] Well, I agree, uh, the Iraqi people needed to be freed and needed to have some kind of -- I'm not going to say democracy, because it's still Muslim, I'm not sure you can ever have a democracy there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but at least the right not to be pulled from your home and tortured the way they were.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  And also I think we're more secure because of -- because of --
L:  I- I think so too.
R:  -- what's happened, you know?
L:  And I -- I really wish he'd pay more attention to other threats like North Korea instead of, like, giving them the cold shoulder.
R:  Absolutely.  A--
L:  I think that kind of would make me mad if I was the guy in North Korea. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I -- I mean, I'm all for the freeing the people, but I think what really upsets me about most of this isn't so much the action that we took, was the view that some Americans have that, like, an example is the Iraqi people, some of them are protesting now.  Isn't that what we went over there to give them was freedom, and part of that freedom, isn't that the freedom to speak out?
R:  I think it's great they're speaking out, and I think, you know, the more debate that we have in this country, I think, you know, I -- I personally don't want to go protest against the war, but I'm happy every time I see protestors on TV because I think it sets an example to the world and to Iraq.
L:  Well, I think everybody has the right to voice their opinion, whether they agree or disagree, and it makes --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- it makes me mad when Americans go, "You have the freedom of speech, but you don't have the freedom to protest".  It's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "You have to have my freedom or no freedom".
R:  Yeah, no, I don't agree with the protestors but I think it's great that they're doing it.  I think it sets an example that we have a working democracy where we can handle dissent and disagreement, you know?
L:  I agree, and I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's healthy in a democracy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] but I also tend to wonder [SIGH] about, now that this -- we're going to be over there and bringing peace, I think more countries need to be involved in the peace measure than just us. 
R:  Um, I don't know that I agree with that.  I think --
L:  Not necessarily the UN.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm not saying bring the UN in.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm just saying --
R:  But -- but have partners, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, supposedly we had all these company, uh, countries that supported what we did.
R:  Right.
L:  Have them -- some of them be more visible, I guess --
R:  That's a good point.
L:  -- is what I'm trying to say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not so much as it's just all us, because I think the rest of the world just sees America [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they don't see our -- the people that went in with -- the other countries that went in with us, and they d- -- need to be a little more vocal.
R:  So it sounds like -- it sounds like from what you're saying that you just don't trust the Bush administration, but you're kind of supportive of what we did, just based on your response to what I said, but --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a hard ti- --
R:  So I hear this a lot from -- from -- I don't know if you're a Democrat, or if you consider yourself Liberal, but I hear this from a lot of people on the left y- --
L:  Actually, I'm a registered Republican. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're hard to categorize, as am I.  That's interesting.
L:  Well, I've really [SIGH] -- I did -- okay, I'm a registered Republican, but I did not vote for Bush.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I just didn't think he had the qualifications to run the country. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't think Texas was in that great a shape that he could stand up and go, "Hey, I can run the country", when it seemed to me that Texas was last in education, in medical insurance and  --
R:  And environment as well.
L:  -- in environment, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a bunch of other things.  S- -- and then with -- with the way the election went, it really made me distrust him even more. 
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  And because I felt --
R:  B- but -- but, see, I think people that are protesting the war, I think it's really a protest against the Bush administration, and I think --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- kind of your comment sort of backed that up.
L:  I think so too.
R:  I wonder -- I mean, I would much rather pro- -- m- my fiancee wants to out and protest against the war, and I said I -- there's a million issues of the Bush administration that I would go and protest against but --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- but not this one.
L:  No.
R:  It's kind of lost leader, you know?
L:  You know, granted, I have not participated in any protests because I do support the men and women that are over there that have joined the armed forces and it's --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- their job to over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't want them to -- or their families to think I don't support them, because I do.
R:  Right.
L:  And I agree with you, I think it's just [MN] I don't trust him or the administration.
R:  Right.
L:  They need freedom, but a --
R:  Yeah, I mean, look at the -- look at h- how the Burton and Carlyle Group getting all the -- or not Carlyle, Bechtel just got a huge contract.
L:  Yeah.  And a l- -- it seems like a lot of the companies that are going over there [SIGH] to, like, work on the oil rigs and to build buildings and stuff, they're all from Texas. 
R:  Right.
L:  And it's like, wait a minute, that doesn't seem quite fair.
R:  That's true.
L:  But then I have --
R:  But on the other hand, I mean the -- the other side of that argument might be, well, given that we, you know, put, u- the risk out, shouldn't we -- and given that that work has to be done, why not have it go to American contractors?  I mean, that m- might be the other side --
L:  Oh, I agree with that --
R:  -- of the argument.
L:  -- but it just seems to me like there's pl- -- my husband used to work in the oil field back in the eighties down in Louisiana, so it seems to me there's companies in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, that are experienced at oil +rig -- rig drilling that could go over and handle the problem, that everything doesn't have to be out of Texas. [LAUGH]  
R:  Right.
L:  I guess I'm just anti Texas now because of Bush.
R:  Huh, yeah, I know, and did you --
L:  And I really di- -- I didn't mind his dad, but it just really went through me when he got on TV and they asked him why we were doing this and he said, "Because he tried to kill my daddy".
R:   [NOISE] [MN]
L:  To me it was so unprofessional.
R:  Sorry, I -- I missed the last thing you said.  I just d--
L:  Oh, I was talking about when he got on TV, and one of the reporters asked him why we were doing this, [SIGH] and he got on TV and he said [MN] beca-, "He tried to kill my daddy".
R:  Oh, I know, I know.
L:  And I thought that was so unprofessional --
R:  I know.
L:  -- for a president to say.
R:  We're going to go smoke him out, we're going to go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, all those expressions, yeah, right.
L:  And we're supposed to be the country of peace and we're getting on TV saying we're got a contract out for this guy's life.  Doesn't seem like a really peaceful approach to me. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  No, I think their diplomacy was -- I mean, other than Colin Powell, I think their diplomacy was atrocious and embarrassing.  I -- I mean, I think they're emba- --
L:  It is.  And I like Col- -- I -- I like Colin Powell. [SIGH] 
R:  But I think the one sort of document of the Bush administration that's compelling is this idea of sort of morality clarity, which I don't think that they adhered to their own ideology.  But that's a very powerful idea, the idea that, you know, there's times where you have sort of put the gauntlet down and -- and -- and move forward, and -- and --
L:  That's right.  I agree.
R:  -- and I think that's, you know, in a -- in many ways, that's really the opposite of what Clinton was, and I think that that's very appealing, coming after eight years of -- of -- of, you know, a president that, uh, you know, "We'll just see which way the wind was blowing every day" and it was so poll driven and so kind of on both sides, on all sides of the issue, you know?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I -- well, uh, I agree with that, but there's always been presidents that -- I feel like every president has -- has done some bad and some good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I have to say that I liked Clinton simply because my economy and my way of life got better in those eight years. [SIGH]
R:  We all -- I mean, a lot of us did, I think, you know?
L:  I mean, I -- me and my husband got married and we started out the year Reagan got elected, and I voted for Reagan and I thought he was going to kill me. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  I couldn't get a job, I couldn't go to college, I couldn't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- do half the stuff I wanted to do, and so I didn't mind Clinton.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it seemed -- it -- it -- it like, upset me when they went after him and Monica Lewinsky because it's, like, well, every other presidents did this, but nobody spent fifty million dollars to investigate it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And als--
R:  There was something about Clinton that just -- that a handful of Republicans really found repugnant, I mean, on a very, very deep level, I think.
L:  And I never understood why people a- assumed Gore was just like Bush or just like Clinton.
R:  Right.
L:  And I couldn't understand why you'd -- when he had the election, we can't vote for Gore, because he's just like Clinton.  Well, he's not.
R:  Right.  Right, that's true.  I agree.
L:  He wasn't in the room when it happ- --
