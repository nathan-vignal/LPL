R:  [NOISE] Hello? 
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Pam.
R:  My name is Ruth.
L:  Hi, Ruth. 
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine.  Where are you from? 
R:  New York.
L:  Oh, New York.  I'm from Oregon.
R:  Oh, cool. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, so we are clear across the country. [LAUGH]
R:  Absolutely.  Very neat.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, --
L:  The last lady I talked about -- talked to was from New Jersey, so -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I wonder if they purposely match us up on opposite sides of the -- of the country.
R:  Uh, last time I spoke to someone from Florida.
L:  Oh, so not necessarily.  Ah, interesting.
R:  Right.  Yes.
L:  This has been real fun.
R:  Yes.
L:  Is -- this is just the second time I've been called.  How about you? 
R:  Me, too.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  I was starting to wonder if I was getting called again. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Me, too.  I guess they had some problems, though, from an email I got it, so ... 
R:  Oh, I didn't see that.  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  Yeah, they said that they had had some problems.  They had gotten more response or something than they had planned on, so ... 
R:  Oh.
L:  Did you find out about it from Freebie Fix, or --
R:  No.  Um, where did I hear about it?  No, I heard about it through, uh, uh, money and shopping, uh, mystery shopping, uh, -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ha, yeah, that's kind of interesting.
R:  Yeah, but I think we're supposed to be talking about that thing.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I was just going to say we'd better get on topic.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] Um, so, let's see, uh, so we're supposed to be talking about what's going on over there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [SIGH] I'm not sure that that's, uh, where we -- [MN] if we should have started this whole thing, but it -- 
L:  I don't think so, either. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Um, but we started and we should just finish and get out. [LAUGH]
L:  I agree.  I agree.  Yeah.  Um, I'll support the troops, I -- I -- I -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- firmly believe that, you know, our Vietnam veterans got a raw deal -- 
R:  Right. 
L:  -- so, you know, when the troops come home I think that they should be appreciated for what they're doing, but I don't think they should have been sent there to start with, so ... 
R:  Because there's -- there's so many things going on in the world, uh, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- [MN] it's ironic because, uh, here we're not even sure about the weapons of mass destruction, as they keep calling them, but yet I think there are pretty clear signals that North Korea is doing all sorts of stuff and I think they're taking advantage of the situation that we're focused over -- over where we are and, uh, -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, and yet other stuff is going on just as seriously elsewhere.
L:  I know, and yet we'll v- -- we'll hear very little, if anything, about that, so, -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  And then, um, also about peace being attained over there.  If you -- if you broaden the spectrum of what the Middle East is, I don't think there will ever be complete peace in the whole region because even if this, um, Iran -- I- Iraq -- pardon me, Iraq situation gets resolved, there's still going to be the Israel, Palestine, all of that.  There's going to be war over there all the time, I think.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] It's unfortunately I think just a matter of degrees -- 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- uh, and -- and, uh, -- and I'm not sure that this -- this is a whole different part of it. [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  This is just a whole different part of it and, uh, -- and, uh -- I mean things are bad enough in Israeli.  I mean I don't know if this is making it any better or worse.  It's just bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I know.  I agree, yeah, and -- and I -- I think -- I think whether lasting peace will be attained in Iraq will depend on how the government forms itself after the war's over, really.
R:  Right.  It's interesting we're taking a part in that as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think it's interesting that the part -- they -- that they sometimes say how the outer regions, that, you know, the people are so unconnected, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the media, they're like, "Who are these people?" [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  They're -- they're suspicious even of, you know, offerings of food and whatnot -- 
L:  Ahah. 
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's very interesting.  And did you hear [LAUGH] -- did you hear, I think I -- [MN] I'm not sure if I got this right, uh, uh, I think Geraldo Rivera was kicked out.
L:  Yes.
R:  You did. [LAUGH]
L:  I thought that was -- actually -- I mean it was -- it's not funny but it was funny -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I guess he was giving away strategic information in his reports.
R:  How ridiculous is that.
L:  I know, isn't that funny? 
R:  I mean, what is he thinking?
L:  I know.  Poor guy.  He just can't win, you know.
R:  Yeah, but that's just --
L:  He did Al Capone's [MN] locker.  
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I thought that was -- poor guy. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, come on, I mean there has to be some, uh, uh, in this -- in this day and age of so much information -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that gets out there, er, there's a responsibility to that -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- and -- and he has to realize that, yes, we need to know stuff, but, no, we don't need to know stuff because then if we know, other people know. [LAUGH] It's really --
L:  Right.  I know.  I have -- my great niece and her husband are both in the army -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they are stationed in Germany right now -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but she's a medic, so, you know, [MN] she could be deployed at any time -- 
R:  Right.  Argh.
L:  -- and I know if she was over there I sure wouldn't want -- I wouldn't want to be given information that might -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cost her her life, you know? 
R:  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  Tell me about it when it's over but don't tell me about it when they're still doing it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- cause they're going to be sitting there watching CNN too, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, [LAUGH] I think that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
L:  I know.
R:  Just because you can say it, doesn't mean you should say it.
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  I just -- I just thought -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- that was mind boggling. 
L:  I know.  Free speech is a right and a privilege but, you know, you also have to remember that your rights go only so far as somebody else's n- nose, you know?
R:  Right, and it's also your responsibility, you know.
L:  Right.  Along with rights do come responsibility and if you don't take your responsibility, then you're endangering other people's lives and --
R:  And we'll take away your rights. [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  That's -- that's really ridiculous.  It's actually -- I just heard, uh, a couple of weeks ago, my sister actually called me up and said because it was the first, uh, -- it wasn't a direct connection but it was the first [SIGH] casualty there, [SIGH] a- a death even, that -- that, uh, she had heard in her -- in her community -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of somebody over there, um, which -- which is very hard, unfortunately.  It hit a family that, uh, their daughter, their young daughter had just passed away last year, uh, from cancer and -- like a twelve year old and then, uh, the same woman's -- I think it was niece or nephew, I think nephew, was one of the ones killed over there -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so it really hit.  I mean not that it hits -- it's good in any family but it hit [MN] the wrong family.
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  Yeah.  That- that's -- that's a tough year.  That's not a good thing.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Um ... [LIPSMACK] an- and as -- as -- as disconnected that is for me, so many steps, you know, degrees of separation, it's still is starting to hit too close to home already.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and it, uh, it does seem like it's, um, all the casualties.  Now, we've got -- we've had several from Oregon -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- killed and it just seems to -- it seems to be, you know, one was from a community where I lived four years ago -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and still it's just, even though I'm separated from it, it's like, "Gee, it could have been a neighbor of mine", you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it -- it just seems so close and so much more real, you know, and I know I was a lot younger during Vietnam war but at the same time, um, you know, I -- so I probably felt disconnected from it because I was a teenager, but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but [MN] this just seemed so close that it's -- it's more frightening.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] I think the older you are because your -- your horizons are broader and you know more people.
L:  Mhm.  Yes.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Absolutely.
R:  So it- it's not a good thing.
L:  No.
R:  You say the Vietnam war.  I remember growing up -- um, I didn't understand the day that Walter Cronkite stopped saying, "And now from Saigon".  I thought that's how you started the news.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ahah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And it took me a while to understand that -- that Saigon was a place. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [inaudible] funny what you remember.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] every night, "And now from Saigon".
L:  Yeah.  You sounded young -- you sound young.  I thought, when I said that I [LAUGH] -- when I said that I remembered the Vietnam war, I thought you were going to tell me that you weren't the- here yet.
R:  No, I was here, I was here -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but -- but-- but I was young. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was definitely young, uh, but, uh, it -- it goes to show how young that -- that it took me a while to realize that, uh -- I only realized when it was over what it was. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Uh, it's very interesting.  Um, but, uh, oh, all right, so we agree [MN] we -- we shouldn't have gone but we just should finish and get out. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think so.  I think we should finish and -- and help them get started, but not play much more of a hand in it than that.  I really don't think so.
R:  [MN] You know, I haven't -- it -- it sounds terrible, wi- with all the holidays and everything I haven't even listened to the news for a couple of days.  They're still not sure if they got them, are they?
L:  No.  
R:  [MN]
L:  They're really not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, they've found, um, -- gosh, maybe I shouldn't tell this because I only heard part of the story.  I was on the computer and heard part of the story -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they found a car that belonged to his -- one of his sons -- 
R:  Ahah. 
L:  -- and somebody else was driving it, though, or something -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] -- or they caught it at a check stop but it was being driven by somebody else so they don't know if it was just looted or [NOISE] -- oh, they -- they do believe that's what it was, is that somebody just basically found Saddam's son's car and was driving it around. 
R:  Wow.  I wonder what that's all about. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, but -- but -- 
R:  Yeah.  Maybe he is gone and they are trying to make it like he's still around.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Who knows? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, we might never know.
L:  No, we may never know.  There's a -- all sorts of underground tunnels and all kinds of ways he could escape, so ... 
R:  I mean, I -- I have to wonder, you know, er, are we putting too much store in one person.  I mean, if -- if he's, you know, either physically or not physically out of the picture, um, does that mean that the whole regime necessarily is gone?  Is that -- I mean I always feel like they put so much store by that, you know what I mean?
L:  I know.  I thought that, too, and I can't decide if, with him gone, [MN] you know, if -- if the regime could continue or --
