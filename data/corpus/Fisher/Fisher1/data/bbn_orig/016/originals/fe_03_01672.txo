L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh --
R:  [MN] My name is Carla.
L:  I'm Kristen.
R:  Oh, hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Pennsylvania, how about you?
L:  I'm from North Carolina.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well this -- this is [LAUGH] going to be interesting then, isn't it?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Now, we're supposed to talk about the Middle East?
L:  Yes, I think so [inaudible].
R:  Well, would that -- does that include the war?
L:  I think -- I think that's probably what --
R:  The whole?
L:  Um, I -- I think that it really doesn't matter, as long as we're talking about something [LAUGH] um --
R:  Well, the last thing I got on said you have to stay on the topic because my -- [LAUGH] the last call I made we got pretty much off the topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and this one said please stay on the topic for ten minutes, so [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  Well I se- I think that that's what it, um, wants us to talk about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, 'cause it talked about [MN] peace and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all that.  Um, so what -- what are your thoughts?  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  I d- I think peace is going to be pretty hard to come by over there.
L:  I -- I agree.  Um, I think that we're working towards something better but I don't think that, um, peace is anywhere in the near future.  Um --
R:  No.  I think our idea of better isn't necessarily their idea of better.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  You know, I think we think democracy is -- is the answer for everybody.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And w- not being, you know, w- we just don't understand their culture I don't believe.
L:  Exactly, right.
R:  And they don't understand ours, do you think?
L:  No, I don't think so.  Um, no, I agree with you.  I think -- I think that the cultural differences --
R:  Yes. [MN] 
L:  -- um, really are a big problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  Don't you think that we have so much, you know, an- and we're -- w- we've just had so much all of our lives that we don't even understand, I don't think, how, you know, like how somebody like a dictator can just come in and take over in a country.
L:  Right.  I think that we're very, um, insensitive to --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- the way other people do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think we think that our way is the only way, the best way --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- the right way and we just can't really see how --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, anyone else can feel differently.
R:  Right.  So everybody else should just do what we tell them. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, did it -- did you hear this week all the talk about -- I mean, kind of threatening talk about Syria?
L:  I did.  Um, and their --
R:  Did that not scare you a little? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]  Um, I -- d- did I -- I f- I might be wrong on this but I thought -- aren't they -- um, don't they have a lot of weapons that they found there?
R:  Y- well, they --
L:  Is that --
R:  What they -- they've -- they think that --
L:  And they're --
R:  -- Iraq was, um, selling them weapons --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for one thing.  Like, these weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Right.
R:  And also getting rid of them there kind of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, you know, and hiding people there.
L:  Right.
R:  But my gosh, the way the President was talking it was like, "Well, okay, we're ready to come over there now".  [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm thinking, "I don't think we got into it for that".
L:  No.  Yeah, I -- gosh.
R:  And I think people really didn't support it 'cause -- now th- today they said that he, or somebody, congratulated Syria -- [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R: -- on what a good job they've done. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  So I thought, "Well, that's kind of a turnaround". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Last week we were gonna go in and flatten them too and this week [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Thank you for being such a big help". [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  Huh, gosh.  Um, I read, I -- I don't know if it was today or a few days ago, they've caught several people on their most wanted list.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think they caught hi- Saddam's brother in law.  Did I ...?
R:  Um, I think that was a couple of days ago.
L:  Was it?
R:  Was that the brother in law?  D- I think they might have gotten a --
L:  They caught someone else toda-
R:  -- a son in law -- a son in law today?
L:  Yeah, maybe that was it.  I knew it was some --
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  -- some relation to him that they got today.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [MN] but I d- --
R:  Yeah, they said he, um, actually tried to make a deal with the Americans.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Or wants to or tried to before they caught him or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- something.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] But then, you know, then I saw these huge demonstrations on the news tonight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was thinking, I- if you don't want to hurt this one guy, say -- this kind of amazed me.  It was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They -- they were sort of explaining the difference between the Shiite's and -- and the other, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- religion and the sects and, you know, what they've got, the differences.
L:  Right.
R:  And this one guy just went in and made himself mayor of this one city.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] 
R:  And he was a cl- he was a Shiite cleric.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he just declared himself mayor --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they said they can't get him to leave the city hall. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he's there -- wh- they interviewed him and he said, "Well, we need the Americans to get the water back on and the electricity back on --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- and then they need -- then they should leave".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm thinking, "Well, why should we turn the water and electricity back on then?" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Why is that our job but [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nothing [MN] I -- yo- you know, I don't understand [LAUGH] any of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really don't. [MN] 
L:  I know, yeah.  Well, I think, ah, gosh.  I don't [SIGH] -- I don't know what to think about all of this.  I just --
R:  No, I wasn't real supportive at the beginning.  I kind of thought it was more about oil than anything else.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then as the war went on, you know, and you saw these people that were, you know, pulling down the statues --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all that stuff, it was like, "Well, gosh" you know, "They really are happy to see us".
L:  Yeah.  I -- I really that the majority of them are happy.  I mean, obviously there's a good number that are not pleased at all with us --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being over there but I think that most think that we're there, we're trying to help them and they're supportive of it.
R:  Yeah.  I kinda think the people in the street, you know, they must be glad to be out from under that.
L:  Yeah, I mean, they've just been living under [MN] this horrible --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dictatorship for -- for so long that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think they're just ready for -- I mean, even it -- e- even if they aren't able to do it themselves and have to have the US come in and help them to --
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Do you think we'll get stuck there?
L:  [SIGH] I don't -- I -- I think that this is all go- -- I thought that, you know, when they were first -- when everything first started, um, I thought it was going to take a very long time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for all this to happen.  It seems to be -- I mean, obviously it's nowhere near over but I --
R:  No.
L:  -- think that it seems like the, um, actual combat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is [MN] not la- gonna last as long as I had thought it would.
R:  Me too.
L:  Um, I mean, obviously the conflict is not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- finished but I thought that they would -- there would be more fighting than it sounds likes there's going --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- to be.  'Cause it just --
R:  I thought they would put up a lot more resistance than they did.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I d- I just wondering how long it's going to be before we actually can leave.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I had a -- a son in the Air Force, he's been out for a couple of years now but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he was -- had to rotate over to Saudi Arabia, you know --
L:  Really?
R:  -- every like a couple of times a year --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Twice a year.  And he- you know, I -- w- he told me when he got home one time he said, "You know, you just can't believe how people live over there".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he said, "If we ever left our interests would be, you know, would just be -- we would have no interest there, you know, we would have no oil, we would have no nothing".
L:  Right.
R:  He said, you know, he said, "We really have to be there --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- all the time to keep things even semi settled".
L:  Right, under control.
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, that's [MN] I don't like the thought that we have to be any place in the world other than being helpful.
L:  Right.  I -- I agree.  And you don't really think about that from day to day.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, you just [NOISE] -- i- it doesn't, until you, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Gosh.
R:  And what you think of poor girl that was the POW?
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  Oh my gosh.  I felt so sorry for her.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, you know, it would just -- and to be the only one, [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the only female. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that must have been terrifying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm -- you know, I'm d- I know it'll come out eventually what happened to these people, you know, and maybe they treated 'em real well, I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  But, boy, she sure looked terrified that first time when they showed her on TV, didn't they?
L:  Yeah.  Gosh.  I think that, um, the POWs, that really -- I mean, you know, you know that people are over there and, you know, horrible things are happening --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to Americans.  But when you actually hear about that and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- see these peopl- -- like, see them, you know.
R:  Oh, I know and they showed that on TV.
L:  Right.  It just kinda really hits home and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you realize that this -- this really is real. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And, like, yeah.  Like those two pilots getting shot down and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, my -- my brother was a pilot in the Air Force --
L:  Yeah, that's like --
R:  -- and I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh".
L:  Gosh.
R:  You know, this is [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  This could be him and this could be my son and [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, you just -- did [MN] did you ever see anything like -- well, you sound -- how old are you?  You sound very young. [LAUGH]
L:  Ha, I'm eighteen. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH] Well, okay, you probably don't remember these other wars --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like that, [LAUGH] you know, seeing as you were only about ten.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Don't know about the last one.  But, I mean, it wa- it was just so amazing to have this on television.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, there's just never been --
L:  Well that -- I was --
R:  -- any such thing.
L:  I was talking to someone, um, a few weeks ago and, you know, I was -- obviously I haven't, you know, really experienced any other wars or anything, but it just amazes me that we can turn on CNN and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, see a war.  It's like --
R:  Yeah.  Fox News, you know?
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  That guys on Fox News he was so darned cute. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That one kid that went through the hole with the Hundred and First bat- Marines --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or whatever he was.  Greg, Greg Kelly I think his name was.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know if you saw him or not --
L:  Yeah, n-
R:  -- but, oh my gosh, he was adorable --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you know.
L:  I just --
R:  And they're showing this -- all this stuff going on.
L:  I know.  I just can't -- I mean, I don't -- I don't know how I feel about that, you know, like --
R:  No, I don't ei- -- I can't imagine it's really safe for 'em.
L:  Uh-uh.  I -- I cannot imagine being a, you know, journalist or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [MN] you know, video guy or whatever over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I mean, it just amazes me that we can
