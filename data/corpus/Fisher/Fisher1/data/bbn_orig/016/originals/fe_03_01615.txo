L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE] Hello [NOISE].  
L:  Hi.
R:  This is Tania.
L:  I'm Megan.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are ya?
R:  I'm not too sure how this works.  This is the first time I've used it.
L:  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, so we won't --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I guess we're supposed to talk about the war.  Is that how I'm understanding it?
L:  I guess so.  I didn't really hear --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all the questions --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that they asked.
R:  [NOISE] From what I understand we're supposed to talk about if we feel we'll always be at peace, I guess --
L:  About --
R:  Is that what you understood?
L:  About what?
R:  If we'll ever get peace again.  I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] I guess so.  I don't know if that's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I guess that's what we're --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- supposed to talk about.  If we're ever supposed to get peace again [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] It made no sense to me either.
L:  Um, [MN] [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know what's gonna happen.  I -- I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- follow it that closely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have to be honest --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with you, um --
R:  Okay, so you're like me [NOISE].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm busy during the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- day and Disney channel's on all day [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I have Lifetime on, so I don't watch much of the war -- what's going on with it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't follow it too much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] They just say -- I heard 'em say we're supposed -- it's supposed to be coming to an end soon.
L:  Really?
R:  [NOISE] But is that gonna be like the Vietnam War, you know, where it's gonna be years down the road [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I have no idea.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, what State are you in?
R:  [NOISE] I'm in Ohio [NOISE].
L:  Ohio? --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm in New Jersey.
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] Not too far.
L:  No --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I just wondered, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if you were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a different time zone, or [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what was going on, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm trying to think, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  What do you think of the war?  [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Of all topics, you know [NOISE].
L:  What?
R:  [SIGH] Of all topics they can think of [NOISE].
L:  I know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  We're supposed to talk --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about the war for like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ten minutes [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I know something had to be done, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Do you think Sad- Saddam --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hussein's dead?
R:  I don't know.  It[?] is -- lots of places that man could hide.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Who knows.
R:  Plus, you know, if they -- they [MN] -- they did kill someone, what's to say it wasn't one of his imposters?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You've got that right.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I -- I --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I don't know what's going on --
R:  I mean, you hear them say that, you know, their imposters had surgery to make 'em look like him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Do you think it's --
R:  So --
L:  -- it's pretty much over, how do you figure?  My husband's telling me it's pretty much over.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  -- what I've heard too, it's like -- that's what they say [NOISE].
L:  Oh, I -- I honestly --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I'm a clueless basically --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't pay attention --
L:  Yeah, [SIGH].
R:  It wouldn't surprise me if down the road he comes up alive.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm sure. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  We're going to war with Syria?  Wonderful [LAUGH].  Ooh.
R:  [SIGH] End one start another.
L:  Yep, of course, I guess -- I don't know.  I guess people aren't backing us.  I heard if we go to war with Korea we're basically dead, but [SIGH] -- which is a pleasant thought [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, isn't it?
L:  [SIGH] I'm only like an hour from New York City, so [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  It was nice when, uh, we smelt everything from, uh, World Trade Center.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not pleasant.  You know, it's kinda scary living out here.
R:  Yeah, you're like right in the center of, uh, the area.
L:  Mm hm.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  It's scary living in this --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- day and age, but [MN] [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I don't know.
R:  At least we don't have no threats over here with the war or with, you know, the bombings or nothing like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, at least they're not fighting over -- yeah, like technically, over here.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I mean, could be worse, I guess, if they come over here, but --
R:  [NOISE] It's like we always have some sort of news footage, you know, either the war or -- or the Trade Center [NOISE].
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  They always have some sort of news footage on TV.  Either the War or the Trade Center [NOISE].
L:  Yep.  And, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there's people that just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- got the POWs that just came out.  That's amazing.
R:  Yeah, I -- I was reading a little of that yesterday [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, it wasn't -- I -- I heard a little bit about it too, yeah, not too much --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I don't even know what else to talk about the war because --
R:  I know there was, um --
L:  Bad subject for me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because I'm clueless.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  The only thing I really know about the war was, uh, the, [NOISE] um, that -- oh, whatever group she was in -- that Jessica Lynch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Part of that platoon was from my area.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it was all over the papers about how that Brandon, whatever his name was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He was just down the road from me [NOISE].
L:  Really?
R:  So, it's like, wherever you look you see the yellow ribbons.  You know, before, you know, they found him dead --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to, uh, s- pray for him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  That's sad --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's an awful way to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- come home from the war but at least they're alive [LAUGH].  I mean, you'd think, "Wow". [SIGH]  You know what I mean? -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, you don't wanna --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have to go through this war anyway, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you come home, but unfortunately, you know, you come --
R:  [COUGH]  Mm.
L:  -- with -- this woman, what, had two broken legs?  I heard that they --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- hung her from her knees to --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- torture her.  So --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah, it's unbelievable.
R:  Um, the ones who die, at least they, you know, they did what they wanted to do.  I mean, it sounds cruel, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] You know what I mean.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] They -- they did what they wanted to do [NOISE].  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They went to fight.
L:  Yep, true.  You have kids?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I have two.
L:  Do ya?
R:  [NOISE] One was actually born on nine eleven.
L:  Really?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Wow.
R:  The year date [NOISE].
L:  On what?
R:  The one year later [NOISE].
L:  Oh, one year later?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, so you have a little one, huh?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] My son was only --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- three weeks old when nine eleven happened, so ...
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  Mine -- he'll be two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in August [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Wow, yeah -- I know a lot of people --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- who have nine eleven --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- birthdays.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it was always [NOISE] interesting.  People [NOISE] commenting about it [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Like Tony[?] didn't choose [NOISE] his birthday [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, of course [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Where'd you find out about this --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- project?
R:  I found it from an AOL message board [NOISE].
L:  Did ya?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Like okay, I can [NOISE] talk on the phone for ten minutes about [NOISE] some topic and get [NOISE] paid for it [NOISE].
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like for [NOISE] what was it, [NOISE] ten or twenty bucks?  Sweet, [NOISE] I'll do it [NOISE].
L:  I have no idea --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- how much it even is.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But, yeah, I do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some mystery shopping --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] so I found out from there.  That board.
R:  I've been trying to get into that [NOISE] but I haven't found anything [NOISE] good.
L:  Really?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess you just go- -- I -- I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like that in the beginning --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too, but I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you just have to find like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the right place --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess to go and now I find tons of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] work.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't looked too much into it though either.  I bet you if I went more rub[?] searching I'd find more, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, you, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I did.  I made about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- five hundred dollars last month.
R:  Oh, wow, that's sweet.
L:  Yeah, that's very nice [LAUGH].  After showing an[?] income for going out to dinner and [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing some extra stuff, so --
R:  I think I'm gonna have to go doing some more searching on that.
L:  Yeah, definitely, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Let me think where you could go.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, Violation, um, V.I. -- I'm thinking, "How do you spell it?"  I.L.I.T.O.N. or something dot com.
R:  Violation?
L:  Yeah, Vi -- V.I. -- it's ei- -- it's V.O.I.L.I.T. -- oh, my god I don't even know how -- how to spell it.  I'm not at my computer either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what?  You just do it -- if you have like a [NOISE] place in mind around you, go to a -- a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- MSN dot com, or something and type in -- you know what I mean, whatever what-, uh, search engine you go through --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Yahoo -- and type in mystery shopping and a lot of the companies will --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- just come up.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I haven't done too much looking into it yet.
L:  What you have to do is sign up for like a million companies [LAUGH].  I mean, in the beginning it's a lot --
R:  I just started working part time.  I was full time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right after I had the baby I went to part time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's a lot of, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of work that you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have to put out in the beginning.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Once you get into the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- swing of things, you -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kinda with the company.
R:  [NOISE] I've only done one -- I've done two shops --
L:  Have you?
R:  -- but that was years ago, when [NOISE] -- you know, it was for Kmart.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] And I just stopped doing it 'cause it was paying -- paying pretty pathetic [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, some of them are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not worth it.  I found the ones that are worth it and not worth it [LAUGH], but ... 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Mm, like ten minutes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- should be up soon, but I guess we haven't talked enough about the war [LAUGH].
R:  I guess not [NOISE].
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't know what else to really say about the war.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  If I kept track, you know.
L:  What?
R:  If we both were following it we probably would have lots to talk about a --
L:  I know.
R:  -- the war.
L:  But I don't follow it.  My son's almost two -- I don't watch TV that much during the day [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Maybe[?] so when they listen to our conversation, they'll know we don't [several inaudible words] less about it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Yep, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have no idea --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if it's ever gonna end any time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- soon.  I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- believe much of what they always --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- say.  Like you said, it could be like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Vietnam, where they say it's gonna end and --
R:  And --
L:  -- takes year or so.
R:  I've heard for last week it's coming to an end, but --
L:  [SIGH] But how?
R:  How long is the end gonna take to get here.
L:  But how?  How does it make it -- you know what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, the end?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE].
L:  Like what makes it be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the end of it?  This -- they're not surrendering I'm sure, so ...
R:  [NOISE] Exactly. [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know and Saddam Huss- --
R:  [NOISE] I don't get it.
L:  I don't think he's dead, so ...  That's just my opinion.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] So ... [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] It could be interesting, I guess. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I guess so.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I heard that a lot of the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people don't get a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- another call for a long time.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.  Hey, Brad --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- will you go in the baby's room and get his clothes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or, no?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Never mind.  I'll do it.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I'll be off in a minute -- soon, probably.  I have to go to the laundry.
R:  Yeah, probably we've got two or three minutes left?
L:  Really?
R:  They called at one fifty nine and after the -- you know, they put me on hold for a minute to get a hold of someone else --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think it was two O one.
L:  Was it?
