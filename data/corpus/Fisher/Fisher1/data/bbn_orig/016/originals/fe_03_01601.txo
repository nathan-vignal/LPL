L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't even hear the topic.
L:  You know, I -- I -- I didn't catch it.  It went by so fast.  It was something about, uh, lessening the chance of terrorism or -- like security at airports or something.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I don't know what we do about that if we're not really sure what the topic is.
R:  Well, I don't think that they really care.  I think --
L:  It -- it might not matter too much.
R:  -- they just like to see what kind of do with it but -- 
L:  So, where are you located?
R:  I'm in Salt Lake City.
L:  Salt Lake City?  Ah, and I'm in, uh, Bellingham, Washington.
R:  Oh, so you're not too far away.
L:  Yeah, and, so -- is -- how -- how many times have you done this?
R:  This is my second time.
L:  Oh, this is my second time and, uh, wha- what was your first topic?
R:  Oh, had something to do with families.  It was, uh, uh, children -- what kind of movies you like to watch or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Going out to movies -- wh- yeah, something like how many times do you like to go out to movies and things?  So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It was -- it was -- it was very interesting.  Talked to a lady from San Diego --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it worked out really kinda fun.
L:  Yeah, the first time I talked to a woman from Montana and the topic was like, do you exercise?  Or something like that --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  And it -- and it was pretty interesting, so, um --
R:  So, how about -- how did you find out about this?
L:  Uh, well, I have a friend who's, um, a linguist and, um, she -- a- actually she's a graduate student, um -- she's just getting her PHD and so she emailed me -- well, I think she kinda spammed her friends and told everybody, "Oh, if you want to make ten dollars" -- and actually it wasn't so much the ten dollars, it just sounded pretty strange, so, you know, s- interesting to do, so, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That -- that's how I heard about it.  What about yourself?
R:  Um, actually it was through, uh -- call- mystery shopping.  You ever heard of the mystery shoppers?  This guy- -- people, uh, businesses that, uh, approach stores and say, "How'd you like to know how your training's going, or how your stores are doing or whatever?" and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And, uh, and as a part of that they said, "Hey, you ought to take", uh, an introduction to it says, "Hey, here -- here's something you know there's a linguistic study being done by --" 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is it Penn State?  I think it's, uh, Penn State or something that's --
L:  Right, that's right, uh-huh.
R:  Um, so, yeah, I just called -- you know, I was introduced[?], get on line it's like, uh, here's the information, just call this telephone number and they'll interview you and if they think you can do it then just do it and --
L:  Right.  So, what -- what's mystery shopping?  It -- do you, um --
R:  That's li- like I said, you know, like I said they, uh, do, um, um -- they look for people, certain age bracket or whatever and, for example, I've gone -- I -- I did about seven banks here not too long ago, all from one -- one type of bank --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they just ask you to go in and act like you want to set up a checking account --
L:  I see.
R:  -- and -- and check and see -- make sure that they follow all the right procedures --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh --
L:  So, it's like, um -- it's kinda like market research?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Right.  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  And they just wanna make sure that, uh, th- -- and then a lot of 'em they wanna make sure that the people are, you know, are following their training -- what they're supposed to be doing.
L:  Uh-huh, oh, I see, I see, uh-huh.
R:  I'm -- I'm -- 
L:  And so -- so do you get paid to do that? 
R:  -- hoping to get some of the fun ones -- the fun ones like golf, you know, go hit golf shops and go do a golf [LAUGH].
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they have some -- restaurants --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I haven't done any of the eating ones yet 'cause I'm on a diet with my wife, so I haven't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- haven't been able to pick any of those ones things up yet.
L:  Uh-huh, oh, that's interesting.
R:  So, what do you do for a living?
L:  Um, well, I'm being laid off actually [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  But, yeah, I know, I've got four months but, um, the economy in Washington's very bad and I w- work for the State, so three people in my department are being laid off, but, um, basically I'm a, um, I'm a web designer, so I'm kind of hit, uh, late by the dotcom crash --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and also, uh, taxes going down and so there's like massive layoffs at the agency I'm at, but otherwise, um -- let's see for about fifteen years I was a teacher and then I worked at -- I've been working for a -- a state education agency, but I've been, uh, doing web development for them, so it's kind of -- so, I'll probably go back to teaching.
R:  Well, uh, yeah, I mean, I w- -- I just know, you know, here in Utah they're just begging for teachers all the time.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, maybe I'll move out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Trouble is my wife won't let me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, wh- wh- and what do you do?
R:  I'm, uh, I'm a purchasing agent. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I work for the -- uh, for the LDS church, the Mormon Church --
L:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, we -- I actually do all the purchasing for all the chapels and all the brand new buildings being built and then the chapels from -- in Washington, Oregon, uh, Idaho, all the way up through, uh, British Columbia and Alaska.  
L:  Wow!
R:  And we prob- -- I have probably about twenty five hundred buildings that, uh, I work with, uh, um, the facility maintenance guys that take care of the buildings --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, do all the purchasing, all the, you know, the things that they use, uh, in the chapel.
L:  It sounds like a lot of ordering.
R:  It -- it is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, there's a lot of contract work too we -- we try to, you know, we set up con- -- national -- try to set up national contracts.  We have probably in the United States and Canada, between nine and ten thousand chapels.
L:  Uh-huh, wow.
R:  And so, there's a group of about -- our group that handles all those buildings, we have one -- oh, about twelve, fifteen of us that handle all those buildings.
L:  Wow, incredible.
R:  So -- and that includes building the new ones.  They -- they build about, oh, between two hundred and fifty and three hundred new chapels every year.
L:  So, when you say chapel, do you mean like a church?  Like a --
R:  Yeah, a church, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  Yeah, a church building.
L:  -- and -- and you said there's nine thousand in North America?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Wow.  Well, y- as a matter of fact my father was born in Salt Lake City.
R:  Was he really?
L:  Yes, and, um, my -- let's see, um, my great grandparents, uh, were Mormons that came over from like Wales, I think.
R:  Wow.
L:  They were Welsh miners who were converts who came over -- oh, gosh, and I -- I can't remember my genealogy too much, but it must've been around like the turn of the century or something, you know, and, um, they, uh, they -- they settled in Salt Lake City and actually my father was born in Bingham Canyon up --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There's a big copper mine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, and then they immigrated out to California during the depression because there was like no work.
R:  Wow.
L:  And so they immigrated out to, uh, California, so -- a- and I've actually been to, yeah, Salt Lake City a couple of times and saw where my fa- -- before the copper mine, um, uh, made the city disappear I actually saw the -- the city where he was born --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so, um, yeah.
R:  Yeah, my, uh, yeah, Kennicutt Copper is the one --
L:  That was it.
R:  -- owns it -- owns it now, yeah.  In fact my brother in law works -- he works in the treasury office for 'em [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, all these, I mean, all these -- I'm originally from Idaho.  I'm from Blackford.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Up Idaho way stuff[?], but --
L:  And then you moved out to Salt Lake?
R:  Well, I -- I went to school at Brigham Young University and then --
L:  Uh-huh.  BYU, right.
R:  -- got my masters degree in business and -- and my first job was actually New Jersey, uh, worked for a large real estate development company in New Jersey and stuff and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um -- but my wife's from here in Salt Lake and we ended up coming back here because of, you know, being basically laid off and it sounds like -- like y- at the time maybe just didn't have enough -- they were growing so fast they didn't ha- -- it was kind of an opposite one I've never y- -- they were growing so fast they needed experienced people.  They didn't feel that they had time to train people and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, uh --
L:  Well, it sounds like it was a good move for you anyway 'cause --
R:  Oh, it -- it -- it's worked out all right.  I -- we really miss being out there.  I mean, we lived -- I just lived -- we lived thirty minutes out of -- out of New York, you know --
L:  Oh, that would be fun.
R:  -- I mean, we could hop on -- you know, we'd only been married like four or five months before --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we moved out there and, uh, we'd -- I'd come home at night, "What do you wanna do?"  And we'd hop on -- you know, get i- -- hop in the car and drive into the city and go see Broadway play or go get to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- see the Yankees, or, you know [LAUGH].
L:  I've always wanted to live in New York City.
R:  It was -- it was really something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I, uh -- we lived in New Jersey of course, but i- --
L:  Well, that's -- it's --
R:  I wouldn't mind --
L:  -- just across the river, right?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah --
R:  I mean it's just --
L:  I kinda have a friend who's -- who was born -- born and raised in New Jersey and he said he could see Manhattan from, you know, like his neighborhood.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you can.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where I worked was right across, I mean, N- New York skyline, every day I mean that's where I worked. 
L:  Oh.
R:  I worked in the Meadowlands just -- just, uh, this side of, uh, Giant Stadium.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...  Have you been out to visit though?
L:  Y- New York, you mean?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, I was there a couple of times when I was very young --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- but not since then.  At least not more than just like flying through, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but, you know, I kind of know the reputation of New York City and like I'm a city kind of person, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, I ...
