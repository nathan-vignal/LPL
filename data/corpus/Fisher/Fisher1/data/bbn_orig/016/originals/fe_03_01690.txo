L:  Hi, I'm Marcia Anderson. 
R:  Hi, I'm Susan.  How you doing?
L:  Okay.  How about you?
R:  Good.  So how you feel about the Middle East? [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not sure.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Everyone around me seems to have different opinions.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, I'm not sure if we could go to peace with Iraq or anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it seems, like, they kinda need our help, but, then again, they don't seem to want it much.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, --
L:  And they accept the food that we give them and the things that we give them, and yet they never say thanks, and they never give us any indication that they want it.  They just take it and run.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What do you think?
R:  Um, yeah, I was actually thinking -- peace in the Middle East, the first thing that came to my mind was the Israeli Palestinian conflict.  But I guess Iraq also falls in the Middle East as well.  It's, um, -- well, I think it's hard.  I think, um, you know, you have to remember that the people were under a dictator, so the information and news that they received was very limited, so I'm sure anything they heard about the United States or America was probably very negative.  Um, and they think it's hard to fight a war for a group of people claiming that you're fighting for their independence and freedom, um, [LIPSMACK] when the people aren't necessarily the ones asking for that assistance.  So, it can be very, um, problematic in that way. [MN] 'Cause obviously a democracy is founded because the people wanted a democracy.  But in this case a democracy was created because the United States wanted to create it, not because the people themselves fought for it.  So I think that can be problematic.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Probably a good thing.  I really don't know much on this subject, I'm sorry. 
R:  No, that's okay --
L:  I'm just --
R:  -- yeah, I was thinking peace.  I mean, I guess the war's almost over, so I would hope it would be peaceful.
L:  I know, that is so cool.  I mean, it doesn't even seem like much of a war.  We haven't fought like a ton of battles or anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't get why we call it that.
R:  A war?  Yeah.
L:  I know, it doesn't even last that long.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I was gonna say, it is kind of weird, considering, [LAUGH] um, it only lasted, um, a number of weeks, and, um, we obviously out gunned them and out bombed them and had many more missiles --
L:  Of course.  We're wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, --
L:  What were the other questions?
R:  Um, will peace ever be obtained in the Middle East?  Like I said, I don't know, I, I was thinking it possibly -- the question when I heard that question, I thought maybe it will be, um, -- it was referring to the Palestinian Israeli conflict, that's what I thought it was referring to.
L:  I'm not sure if it'll be a -- ever obtained, you know?  Because they're so different from each other.  You've got, like, so many different classes there, and all of them are, like, suspicious of each other and going, they don't like each other, and they won't listen to each other. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And just sit down and try to work out the things that they have in common, instead of focusing on the worst things that are different.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I think they -- obviously different cultures, it's a clash of civilizations, two completely different kinds of cultures.  Israel's, like, probably the one and only modern, um, democratic nation amongst, um, you know, some very conservative Muslim nations, so it makes it the odd ball out.  So ... and of course a part of the tensions are that the Palestinian people want their own state and their own homeland, and they don't have it.
L:  I know.  They're, like, -- a little while back how they were all fighting with the, ah, other people over that, and how upset they were, and then I found out something interesting, um, from a friend of mine who's a really cool history teacher.  Apparently, um, the, ah, I think it was Clinton --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'm not sure, ah, he was, ah, with, the Pa- Palestinian leader, and the leader of the dudes they were fighting against, and apparently the people got -- the lea- Palestinian leader got everything that he asked for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then he turned it down.  
R:  Apparently he got a very good deal and he turned it down.  This was with Clinton, yeah, this was a while ago.  I, I don't remember if it was Sharon or Barak -- but yeah, because, um, yeah, [LIPSMACK] apparently he got a very good deal, and, um, he turned it down because he knew the people would not support it and he knew he'd probably be assassinated.  I think that was part of the reason.  Um, --
L:  You almost feel sorry for him.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't get why the people would refuse it.  They got all the stuff that they were protesting for, like being their own state and having help from the government, like billions of dollars, and then they just refuse it and suddenly say that they don't want it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I'm not really sure of the politics behind it, but my guess would be that, um, ... [PAUSE]
L:  Um, --
R:  Um, I'm -- I'm not sure, but I, I think my guess would be that they just didn't want to deal with Clinton, and -- I don't know if it was Sharon or Barak, but whoever it was back when -- you know, the Israeli prime minister or president back in the day, they just didn't want to deal with him.  I'm not really sure.  Um, but I know they're angry for many a reason, partly not having their own state and being held in refugee camps for a while.
L:  I know.  That would seem so awful, being stuck in a camp.  I, I'm not much of an outdoors person, I like the indoors thank you very much.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know if it's outdoors as in roughing it, or if it's just -- I think maybe like a settlement, like an area.  I'm hoping they have [LIPSMACK] some kind of facility, but, um, -- yeah.
L:  So would I.  Nothing like the Japanese Americans or African Americans or anything like that.  I'm hoping they have a nice place.
R:  Mhm.  Japanese Americans have what?
L:  Oh, like, back in the, ah, World War Two, I think it was -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how the Japanese Americans got stuck in all these camps, and --
R:  Oh, yeah, the internment camps.
L:  Argh.  
R:  Yeah, they had everything taken away from them.  So, ... hm.
L:  Think there's any other problems in the Middle East?
R:  Um, um, I just think the biggest problem is a clash of, ah, the cultures, clash of civilizations, and, ah, we have to be careful -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not to impose our way on other people.
L:  And not try to get too involved.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just, like, help them a little bit when they need them -- when they need it, but don't try to get too involved and don't try to help them too much, because then they'll start relying on you, and when you end up having to draw back, due to probably politics or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then they'll get pretty upset.  So, to watch that out.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's, that's probably good advice.  So ... I don't know what else to say on the topic -- peace --
L:  Neither do I.  I'm just kind of stuck here.  Yeah, okay, sure. [LAUGH]
R:  Peace and Middle East conflict.  Yeah, war bad, peace good. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  "I don't want to die.  Mommy." [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, ...
L:  Um, ...
R:  I think we have one minute left.
L:  One minute?  You're timing it?
R:  I just looked at the clock.  I don't know -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't know when we started talking, but I know I got a call right on the hour.  But I don't know when we connected.  So I think we have a minute or two left.
L:  I'm just muttering around, I'm not sure what to say. [PAUSE] Where are you, anyway?
R:  I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Whoa --
R:  Where are you?
L:  -- I'm in Washington.
R:  Washington DC?
L:  Nope, the other Washington.  Other side --
R:  The state?
L:  -- of -- yeah.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.
L:  Yeah, I'm near Seattle and Puyallup.
R:  That's really far.  I, I had no idea this was a national survey.
L:  I know.  It's probably world wide.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Freakish.
R:  That's, um, pretty impressive.  'Cause the email address I saw, it looked like it was Penn, I just thought maybe it was a local
