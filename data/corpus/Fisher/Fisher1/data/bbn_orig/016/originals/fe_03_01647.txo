R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Karen Sao. 
L:  Hi, Karen, my name is Barbara.
R:  Oh, where do you work? 
L:  Ah, well, my husband and I own a small Sub shop, a sandwich shop, [MN] take out place.
R:  Oh. I work in an engineering company and it's part of Horizon. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that sounds great.
R:  [LAUGH] So, ah, what do you think of the Middle East peace situation? [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's awful, I think it's horrible, [LAUGH] I hate it, I hate it, and I -- I wish we were out of there but I guess that's where we should be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  I'm -- I'm really not sure.  You know, every day I change my mind.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Like, one day I think we should be out of there, the next day I think we're right, you know, I think we're wrong and I -- I just keep changing my mind.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, since September eleventh it's like -- it's ki- -- I don't know, it's -- it's scary to me and ... 
R:  Mhm.  Do you think it's different depending on which country is involved?  I mean, I have different opinions for whether it's Israel or Iraq or Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East.
L:  Well, yeah, that's exactly what it is.  You know, it depends on what country and it's just, like, you know, um, after a while I just, like, I keep kind of, like, tuning it out lately.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think I've had, like, enough of it or something, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I just want to go on with my life.
R:  Sure.  Well, part of the problem is there's not enough information available that one can tell is correct.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So when they talk about weapons of mass destruction there has never been anything very conclusive published that one knows.  I mean, certainly Colin Powell made this claim to the entire United Nations and provided some rather persuasive informa- persuasive evidence.  Um, on the other hand it's not clear that they have found any ma- weapons yet and I'm not sure how they could find them.  They were very -- they would be incredibly easy to hide, pieces, and take lab equipment apart and hide chemicals.  I mean, they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- have a whole country to hide them.  I mean, can you imagine trying to find something like that in the United States, you'd never find it.
L:  Right, you wouldn't.
R:  So, I don't know [LAUGH] I was never sure what the reason was for going into Iraq.  I have the impression that although they never said it, they say things like, "They wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein", they kept saying, "There were weapons of mass destruction", um, [LIPSMACK] I often think that the reason they wanted to go in was because they were afraid that Hussein would destabilize the entire Middle East.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The -- the weapons he has, even though missiles that they found and so forth, whatever they did find, ah, struck me as not poten- posing any danger at all to the United States but I'm sure Turkey, um, should have been really worried. [LAUGH] The local countries should have been really worried about him and, ah, I -- I was thinking that was why we went in.  Getting rid of Hussein was probably a good thing.
L:  Yeah, it was a good thing, it was a good thing for the people but I don't know if we are really hitting our target as far as, you know, I mean this all stems back to September eleventh.
R:  Mhm.  You mean ter- anti terrorist? 
L:  The anti terrorist and, you know, I'm not so sure, that, you know, the -- the ones that are out to really target us aren't able to do a little more, make a little more plans because we are somewhere else now, concentrating on someone else.
R:  Mhm.  Certainly we're making more enemies for ourselves.
L:  We certainly are, we certainly are and I don't think that's a good thing not, you know, not in the situation that we are in but I guess when it comes to war, you know, you always make enemies, that's par for the course. [inaudible]
R:  I'm wondering whether they are going to be able in the aftermath to create environments in the Middle East where we can make friends, um. [LAUGH]  I don't think that they appreciate what we did at all.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  I'm not sure they think it was a good thing.
L:  No.
R:  People don't like to be invaded, their country -- have their countries invaded.
L:  No, no, no, no. 
R:  Um, ...
L:  I'm not so sure that we really did the right thing either. I -- 
R:  But it doesn't seem like the wrong thing to me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- isn't that -- see this is -- this is what I was trying to say --
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  -- but I really don't know how to express it.
R:  I just don't think there's enough information.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  So it does seem like the right thing and it seems like the wrong thing at the same time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's just I can't pinpoint it and then a lot of times when I'm watching the news I start to tune it out because, like, five minutes ago on another station I heard something else.
R:  Right, there's a lot of conflicting opinion, lots of conflicting evidence and of course nobody can foresee the future.
L:  Right.
R:  There's no way to know what would have happened if they hadn't gone in.
L:  Right. Right.
R:  So you are having to compare this -- it's just sort of like asking somebody, "Do you think you made the right career choice?". 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Ah, you know, "Did you -- did you go to the right college?".  Who knows? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't know because they didn't go to the other one too. [LAUGH]
R:  What would have happened, you know, should -- it's very difficult to know something like this because there's not an obvious horrendous disaster yet -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that makes it clearly wrong --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- at least near term.
L:  Right.
R:  Even if things had gone badly it could still have turned out to be the right thing when somebody from a hundred years from now looks at it will say, "Oh, it was a really good thing".
L:  That's right, yeah.
R:  Ah, I don't know.
L:  I don't know either.  I don't know either.  I do know that I think -- I think this is really gonna change the world.  I think this is going to make a lot of changes, I hope for the better, I hope not for the worse. But --
R:  Ah, well technology is making quite a difference.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, --
L:  I just don't know how it's going to affect our children and that's what, you know, ... 
R:  Mhm.  Well, hopefully they will become friends.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, I notice we have a tremendous number of people from the Middle East in this country, in the United States. Uh, --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- in our colleges and -- and ...
L:  Yeah, and I --  and I almost feel sorry for them because a lot of them are being harassed to the point where it's, you know, it's incredible because these people have been here maybe since they were children.
R:  Mhm, mhm, mhm. 
L:  They are citizens and a lot of them are, um, -- you know, they are almost true Americans because they don't know anything else.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And -- 
R:  And those are the people we should make friends with --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- and then they can go back and spread the word and act as sort of a bridge between the cultures.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, that would be very nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I don't think we are going to convert anybody in the next hundred years from their position to ours. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I don't think so. [LAUGH] --
R:  Ah, I don't know.
L:  -- I don't think so. I don't think so.
R:  I think the thing that worries me most actually about the war in Iraq is all the other countries we neglected in the meantime.  We have been ignoring Afghanistan and Mexico and North Korea and Africa, all the countries in Africa, which it's not a country, it's a continent, but there are so many things [LAUGH] they should have been watching at the same time.
L:  Maybe Bush intends to do it one at a time. [LAUGH] 
R:  One at a time, that could be ... 
L:  [LAUGH] One at a time.
R:  Well, I mean, he is certainly burning political bridges with Mexico and I think -- did you see the article in the Globe that said, "That there has never been a third world country that has found a lot of oil reserves that has been able to avoid turning into a country with a corrupt totalitarian government"? 
L:  No, I didn't see that actually.
R:  It was funny, it's sort of -- and as far as I know it's true because what happens is those other countries don't develop any other resources or industries and the oil is controlled by the government which makes -- you know, gives them lots of money and no reason to share and the people are satisfied because they have this nice easy lifestyle and so they end up with a -- a, um, despotic government and the people just sort of don't mind because they are well taken care of [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they have no other industry so they have basically very, very well to do government and relatively poor populous, um, because they are not developing other professions and other industries and stuff like that so they are all dependent on the oil [LIPSMACK] and then everybody bribes everybody to get access to the oil and the money that comes with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they said, "That it's really going to be very difficult to create a democracy in Iraq or anything approaching a fair government, a fair count- -- a fair community there".  I thought that -- that didn't bold well. [LAUGH]
L:  No. Oh, well ...
R:  So we will see how they are doing that.  So, what did -- what did most of your friends think? 
L:  My friends, I think most of them kind of feel the same way I do.  I think that they just don't know, you know, they just, like, go to day -- 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- and make their opinions day to day.
R:  Mhm. Yeah.
L:  Because, as like you said, it's really true, we just really don't have enough information.
R:  I know.  Most of the people I work with and the people I know nobody -- everybody sort of says gee, it's hard to know, I wish we didn't have to go to war, you know, it didn't seem right, it doesn't seem wrong [LAUGH] it's just, like, everybody wanted Hussein to go away. [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah, you know, on a lot of things I can be a very opinionated person and you can't change my mind.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, if you stuck my head in the mud you couldn't change my mind.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I can't really form a true opinion on this.  I just, um,  you know, -- 
R:  Uh-huh, yeah. [MN]
L:  -- I just keep floating back and forth, back and forth, back and forth and maybe -- maybe it's too a little bit of what I want and what I don't want mixed in.
R:  I think it's because it's actually just hard to know what the right answer is because it isn't a simple question.  It isn't -- people weren't being asked, "Would you like to have Hussein removed?".  They are being asked, "What do you think the long term impact will be of having put military people into -- you know, US military into another country and ousted the local government?".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's a complicated question.  It's not like they attacked us, in which case people would easily have sort of a right and wrong reaction -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- They'd say, "Oh --"
L:  Right. Right. Right.
R:  -- it's right to defend yourself but, you know, is it right to go in and remove another country's, um, dustmen, I don't -- you know -- a terribly difficult person, is that a -- is that a good thing -- 
L:  Right. 
R:  -- especially when the people that haven't invited you to go do it. Ah, --
L:  Right, one of my friends --
R:  It's hard, hard.
L:  -- yeah, one of my friends kind of feels that, um, we actually went in there because we could not target the ones that got us from nine eleven.
