AND THOSE THREE ISSUES PR- WERE WRITTEN IN OSLO THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE DEALT WITH UNTIL LATER  (fe_03_01614-B-0040)
[LAUGHTER] BECAUSE NO ONE WANTED TO DEAL WITH THEM BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THOSE ARE THE ISSUES [LAUGHTER] THE ONES THAT NO ONE CAN AGREE ON AND THAT'S WHY IN THE END OSLO FELL APART BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_01614-B-0041)
YOU COULDN'T THERE GOT TO A POINT WHERE YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES AND THEY WERE BECOMING SO PROBLEMATIC THAT YOU WERE HAVING MORE AND MORE UNREST AND THAT AND THEN IT WAS OVER YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01614-B-0042)
SO  (fe_03_01614-B-0043)

UM  (fe_03_01614-B-0045)
IRAQ AND WHAT'S GOING ON THERE PLAYS IN  (fe_03_01614-B-0046)

IT'S JUST IT'S  (fe_03_01614-B-0050)
A CLOSE ENOUGH PART OF THE REGION THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS THERE WILL AFFECT THE SITUATION AND I THINK GLOBALLY PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK OF THEM BEING VERY INT- MAYBE EVEN MORE INTERTWINED THAN THEY REALLY ARE UM  (fe_03_01614-B-0051)
BUT  (fe_03_01614-B-0052)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01614-B-0053)
MHM WELL I THINK WITH THE SUICIDE BOMBINGS THOUGH YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE LEADERSHIP SAYS BECAUSE ALL IT TAKES IS ONE PERSON STRAPPING SOME STUFF TO THEM  (fe_03_01614-B-0054)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01614-B-0055)

ABSOLUTELY AND THERE HAD BEEN I MEAN  (fe_03_01614-B-0058)
YOU KNOW IS- ISRAEL FOR WHATEVER IT'S DONE IS ALSO A PRODUCT OF BRITAIN'S DECISIONS YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT IF I LOOK HISTORICALLY AT WHAT  (fe_03_01614-B-0059)
WHO'S REALLY TO BLAME IN MY MIND IT'S MORE BRITAIN THAN ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE BRITAIN BASICALLY POST WORLD WAR TWO IS LIKE OOPS WE'RE TOTALLY YOU KNOW WE'RE IN RECOVERY WE JUST REALLY CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION AND WE DON'T HAVE THE THE TROOPS OR THE MONEY TO PUT INTO IT  (fe_03_01614-B-0060)
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO SORT OF LET IT GO ITS OWN WAY NOW AND [LAUGHTER] YOU HAD WARS AND YOU HAD THE CREATION OF ISRAEL UM AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW [NOISE] BRITAIN  (fe_03_01614-B-0061)
BY TAKING ON ALL ITS ALL ITS COLONIALIST UM  (fe_03_01614-B-0062)
[NOISE] ACTIONS IT BECAME BASICALLY IRRESPONSIBLE AT THAT POINT IT WAS TOO INVOLVED TO MAKE THAT KIND OF DECISION AND WHEN THEY MADE THAT KIND OF DECISION THEY BASICALLY SCREWED IT UP FOR EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE  (fe_03_01614-B-0063)
THEY DIDN'T DEAL RESPONSIBLY WITH THE SITUATION THEY HAD CREATED AND NOW THE WHOLE WORLD IS DEALING WITH THE RESULTS OF THAT YOU KNOW I THINK I MEAN IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN I UM WAS LIVING THERE I WENT WITH A GROUP  (fe_03_01614-B-0064)
OF PEOPLE I WE WERE ALMOST ALL HAD SOME JEWISH HERITAGE AND I H- I'M HALF HALF JEWISH AND UM  (fe_03_01614-B-0065)
AND AND I WOULD SAY COMING IN WE'RE ALMOST ALL  (fe_03_01614-B-0066)
SLIGHTLY MORE TENDING TOWARDS MORE PRO ISRAELI JUST BECAUSE  (fe_03_01614-B-0067)
WE THAT WAS OUR BACKGROUND AND PEOPLE HAD GROWN UP WITH VARYING DEGREES OF YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01614-B-0068)
UM  (fe_03_01614-B-0069)
INVOLVEMENT YOUNG ZIONISTS AND ETCETERA ETCETERA  (fe_03_01614-B-0070)
UM AND I THINK WITHOUT EXCEPTION WE LEFT PRO PALESTINIAN  (fe_03_01614-B-0071)
WHICH YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S JUST ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE UM BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS  (fe_03_01614-B-0072)
REALLY HARD ABOUT ACTUALLY LIVING THERE AND SEEING THE REALITY THAT YES IT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01614-B-0073)
YOU KNOW BUSES BLOW UP BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PALESTINIANS THEIR THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING IS SO FAR BELOW THE ISRAELI STANDARD OF LIVING  (fe_03_01614-B-0074)
THAT IT'S REALLY HARD AFTER A WHILE UM  (fe_03_01614-B-0075)
TO  (fe_03_01614-B-0076)
TO SYMPATHIZE OVERLY WITH THE MAJORITY OF ISRAELIS WHO ARE LIVING AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THERE ARE DEFINITELY SEGMENTS OF ISRAELI SOCIETY THAT ARE QUITE POOR BUT UM ON THE WHOLE ISRAELI LIVING CONDITIONS ARE SO MUCH BETTER  (fe_03_01614-B-0077)
UM  (fe_03_01614-B-0078)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01614-B-0079)
BUT SEE THIS IS THE INTERESTING THING BECAUSE IN FACT AND IT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT A LOT OF ISRAELI EDUCATION SAYS HONESTLY I MEAN THAT'S EXACT IN LINE LOOK YOU KNOW WE'RE A SMALL COUNTRY WE'RE SURROUNDED BY THIS ARAB WHICH IS TRUE CERTAINLY I MEAN GEOGRAPHICALLY  (fe_03_01614-B-0083)
BUT IN FACT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE GONE TO SURROUNDING COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN TREATED BASICALLY YOU COULD SAY IT'S A FORM OF RACISM AND  (fe_03_01614-B-0084)
