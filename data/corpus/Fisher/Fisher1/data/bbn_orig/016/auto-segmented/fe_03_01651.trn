THE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS WAR  (fe_03_01651-A-0071)

WELL I MEAN I STAND ON DIFFERENT ISSUES ON THE MIDDLE EAST DIFFERENTLY BUT UM WE COULD START BY BY HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT UM AMERICA'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE RECENT WAR IN IRAQ  (fe_03_01651-B-0004)
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU  (fe_03_01651-B-0005)
I THOUGHT IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS AND TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE  (fe_03_01651-B-0006)
AS IT DID  (fe_03_01651-B-0007)
AND UM I AND THE THING IS IS THAT HE KEPT CHANGING EVEN HIS RATIONALE FOR US GOING IN  (fe_03_01651-B-0008)
UM AND YOU KNOW THE WEAP- WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WERE NEVER FOUND UM IF THEY FIND SOMETHING I THINK IT COULD BE A PLANT  (fe_03_01651-B-0009)

AH AVOID CIVILIAN CASUALTIES EVEN THE  (fe_03_01651-B-0011)
THE  (fe_03_01651-B-0012)
TERMINOLOGY THAT THEY USED FOR THE INITIAL AERIAL PART OF THE BOMBING WAS SHOCK AND AWE  (fe_03_01651-B-0013)
AND THAT IS  (fe_03_01651-B-0014)
SO MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE ESPECIALLY AFTER HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI TO EVEN USE THOSE WORDS TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING WH- AND EVERYTHING THEY DID TO ME SEEMED TO VIOLATE THE GENEVA CONVENTION  (fe_03_01651-B-0015)
BECAUSE WHEN THEY BOMBED THE BUILDING THAT THEY THOUGHT SADDAM HUSSEIN AND HIS SONS MIGHT BE IN THEY KNEW THAT THERE WERE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN THAT BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY DIDN'T CARE  (fe_03_01651-B-0016)

RIGHT EXACTLY BUT YET WE MURDERED ALL THE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN I DON'T KNOW I MEAN [MN]  (fe_03_01651-B-0024)
TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE ON A COURSE OF GENOCIDE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WORSE  (fe_03_01651-B-0025)
THAN THE SUICIDE BOMBERS OF PALESTINE WORSE THAN THE AGGRESSION THAT ISRAEL DOES IN RETALIATION FOR SUICIDE BOMBING AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING HAS LESS  (fe_03_01651-B-0026)
MORAL JUSTIFICATION THAN THE OUTRAGEOUS ACTS THAT THOSE OTHER COUNTRIES OR GROUPS DO BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LIVING THERE  (fe_03_01651-B-0027)
WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THEIR CULTURE AND THEY HAVE AND THEY C- EVEN THE MUSLIMS THERE CAN'T EVEN AGREE WITH EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01651-B-0028)
AND THE- THEY HAVE A LOT OF DISSENT AMONG THE MUSLIMS OF THE DIFFERENT SECTS  (fe_03_01651-B-0029)
AND AND UM I THINK IT'S THERE'S JUST GOING TO BE MORE OF A BLOODBATH THIS REMINDS OF  (fe_03_01651-B-0030)
OF HISTORICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE BRITISH PULLED OUT OF INDIA AND THE SHEIKS THE HINDUS AND THE MUSLIMS START WHO WE- WERE LIVING TOGETHER PEACEABLY STARTED KILLING EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01651-B-0031)
BECAUSE THE BRITISH DIVIDED THE COUNTRY AND MADE MADE PEOPLE MOVE FROM ONE PART TO ANOTHER AND EVERYONE WAS LOSING THEIR PR- THEIR LAND AND THEIR PROPERTY AND BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR LOVED ONES  (fe_03_01651-B-0032)
RIGHT AND AND YOU KNOW IT'S WE'RE NOT STOPPING AT IRAQ NOW WE'RE THREATENING SYRIA AND LEBANON  (fe_03_01651-B-0033)
AND IT'S REALLY I'M REALLY AFRAID THAT THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO WORLD WAR THREE  (fe_03_01651-B-0034)
WIPE IT OUT  (fe_03_01651-B-0035)
WE CAN'T WIPE IT OUT BUT YET THE THINGS WE'RE DOING  (fe_03_01651-B-0036)
COULD FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF TERRORISM TOO BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE THE APPROVAL OF THE GOVERNING BODY OF THE WORLD  (fe_03_01651-B-0037)
THE THE DIPLOMACY RIGHT CENTER OF THE WORLD THE U._N. YET WE DID IT AND AS FAR AS I CAN SEE OUR ONLY REASONS WERE ECONOMIC  (fe_03_01651-B-0038)
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO CONTROL OIL IN THE FUTURE AND POLITICAL MAINTAINING A HOLD ON THAT PART OF THE WORLD SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE AS MUCH OIL AS WE WANT AT THE CHEAPEST RATES POSSIBLE AND THAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY DEATH  (fe_03_01651-B-0039)
OF A NATION OF IT'S PEOPLE AND WE'RE DOING  (fe_03_01651-B-0040)
AND THERE'S ALL THOSE CHILDREN BURNT AND MUTILATED AND MAIMED WITHOUT ANTIBIOTICS WITHOUT WATER  (fe_03_01651-B-0041)
WITHOUT YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF MEDICINE THEY SAID THEY WERE CUTTING PEOPLE'S LIMBS OFF WITHOUT ANESTHETIC IT'S  (fe_03_01651-B-0042)
I AGREE SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WE AS CITIZENS CAN DO TO CONTAIN OUR COUNTRY'S CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT IN MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD  (fe_03_01651-B-0043)
AND WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PASS THE PATRIOT ACT TWO WHEN THE PATRIOT ACT ONE IS ALREADY UNCONSTITUTIONAL  (fe_03_01651-B-0044)
[MN] THAT'S WONDERFUL  (fe_03_01651-B-0045)
OH THAT IS WONDERFUL  (fe_03_01651-B-0046)
IT'S WORSE THAN MCCARTHYESQUE  (fe_03_01651-B-0047)
WELL THAT MEANS YOU AND I SINCE WE'RE SPEAKING ON A RECORDED TAPE [LAUGHTER] FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA  (fe_03_01651-B-0048)
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING A VIEW  (fe_03_01651-B-0049)
AND DOING SOMETHING TO PUT IT INTO ACTION I THINK PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO HOLD WHATEVER VIEW THEY WANT BUT IT'S HIGHLY DIFFERENT IF THEY DO AN ACTION THAT'S ILLEGAL  (fe_03_01651-B-0050)
AND PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED  (fe_03_01651-B-0051)
SO DID TIM ROBBINS HER HUSBAND  (fe_03_01651-B-0052)
RIGHT THEY WERE TRYING TO KEEP IT US FROM DOING IT  (fe_03_01651-B-0053)

RIGHT IN USING IN USING COMMUNICATION NEGOTIATION ALL OF THESE NOBLE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUT INTO PRACTICE IN THIS NEW MILLENNIUM  (fe_03_01651-B-0055)
YOU KNOW HERE'S THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF CIVILIZATION AND WE'RE STILL JUST MURDERING EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01651-B-0056)
