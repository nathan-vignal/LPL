HI I'M BEVERLEY SCHWARTZ  (fe_03_01623-A-0001)
HI JAY  (fe_03_01623-A-0002)
ALL RIGHT WELL AT LEAST WE GOT A GOOD TOPIC TODAY  (fe_03_01623-A-0003)
AH STRIKES IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS  (fe_03_01623-A-0005)
I'M IN BOSTON MASS AND YOU  (fe_03_01623-A-0006)

THEY'RE RECORDING US RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01623-A-0011)
AND WE TALK FOR TEN MINUTES ON THESE SELECTED ON THE TOPIC OF THE DAY  (fe_03_01623-A-0012)

I'M VERY CYNICAL ABOUT OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION  (fe_03_01623-A-0020)
UM I THINK THAT THEY'VE DONE A BIG BAYTON SWITCH ON US I WAS ALMOST AT THE POINT OF SUPPORTING THE WAR WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_01623-A-0021)
BUT YOU KNOW THEN THEY GO IN AND YOU KNOW THEY START TALKING ABOUT AH GETTING GETTING RID OF THE YOU KNOW HUSSEIN  (fe_03_01623-A-0022)
REIGN OF POWER AND IT'S LIKE WAIT A SECOND WE JUST HAD A BAYTON SWITCH HERE WHAT HAPPENED TO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_01623-A-0024)
MHM  (fe_03_01623-A-0025)
MHM  (fe_03_01623-A-0026)
THAT I HAVE TO AGREE UM IT IT DEFINITELY HAS GONE UM  (fe_03_01623-A-0027)
MUCH FASTER  (fe_03_01623-A-0028)
MHM  (fe_03_01623-A-0029)
WELL IT'S STILL VERY EARLY I MEAN WE'RE S- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CULTURE THAT'S GOT PROBABLY SEVEN DIFFERENT UM  (fe_03_01623-A-0030)
ETHNICITIES AT LEAST  (fe_03_01623-A-0031)
EACH WITH THEIR OWN VALUES AND THEIR OWN AGENDAS  (fe_03_01623-A-0032)
UM WELL ONE I I AGREE WITH YOU IT IS A VERY U._S. CENTRIC VIEW UM YOU KNOW AN INTERESTING THING FOR ME IS WHEN THE WAR STARTED I WAS AH TRAVELLING FROM VIETNAM TO CAMBODIA  (fe_03_01623-A-0033)
SO IT WAS VERY INTERESTING BEING IN A COUNTRY WHICH WAS COMPLETELY DEVASTATED BY  (fe_03_01623-A-0034)
AH AMERICAN FORCES  (fe_03_01623-A-0035)
UM WHILE LISTENING TO ALL THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT GOING TO IRAQ  (fe_03_01623-A-0036)
AND UM  (fe_03_01623-A-0037)
YOU KNOW IT'S  (fe_03_01623-A-0038)
THE THING IS IS OUR WAY IS NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT WAY  (fe_03_01623-A-0039)
AND I THINK THAT IT IS ARROGANT TO SAY  (fe_03_01623-A-0040)
THIS WHOLE ATTITUDE OF MAKING THE WORLD SAFE FOR DEMOCRACY WHICH WAS THE ATTITUDE THEY HAD IN THE VIETNAM ERA  (fe_03_01623-A-0041)
UM IT'S IT'S CRAZY  (fe_03_01623-A-0042)
UM YOU KNOW IN VIETNAM NOW THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGES IT'S IT'S A VERY POSITIVE UP BEAT PLACE RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE NOT UM RALLYING FOR DEMOCRACY AT THIS POINT  (fe_03_01623-A-0043)
YES  (fe_03_01623-A-0044)
IT'S BENEFITING SOME UM IT HASN'T REALLY WORKED ITS WAY INTO THE  (fe_03_01623-A-0045)
THE AH HINTERLANDS YET UM ALTHOUGH I THINK EVERYBODY IN GENERAL IS BETTER OFF THAN THEY WERE TWENTY YEARS AGO  (fe_03_01623-A-0046)
UM  (fe_03_01623-A-0047)
BUT  (fe_03_01623-A-0048)
THE THING THAT I LEAR- I DID A LOT OF READING ON VIETNAM BEFORE I WENT AND THE THE THING THAT I LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE IS THAT  (fe_03_01623-A-0049)
YOU KNOW THE ATTITUDE OF THE UNITED STATES IS OH THEY'RE SO BACKWARD AND YOU KNOW WE'RE  (fe_03_01623-A-0050)
YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY LOSE TO THEM AND WE HAD NOT A CLUE AS TO WHAT THEIR VALUE SYSTEMS WERE  (fe_03_01623-A-0051)
AND UM THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE SPLIT ABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT THEY WANTED TO GO IN  (fe_03_01623-A-0052)
AND YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT OUR ADMINISTRATION IS A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED THIS TIME AROUND IN UNDERSTANDING  (fe_03_01623-A-0053)
AH THESE DIFFERENT FOLKS AND UM  (fe_03_01623-A-0054)
[LIPSMACK] AH WHAT THEY'RE WANTING OUT OF THEIR GOVERNMENT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK IF WE GO IN AND SAY OKAY HERE'S DEMOCRACY MODELED AS IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES UM GO AHEAD LET'S LET'S PUT IN THIS PLACE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO LIVE BY  (fe_03_01623-A-0055)
YEAH WELL I I GUESS THERE'S TWO PARTS WILL WILL THE THE AREA OVERALL UM IMPROVE PROBABLY THERE WILL PROBABLY BE MORE STABILITY THAT COMES OUT OF THIS BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO ENFORCE STABILITY  (fe_03_01623-A-0057)
AND CERTAINLY THE ECONOMIC LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO IMPROVE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CONTROL OF THE OILFIELDS IN IRAQ AT LEAST FOR A SHORT WHILE  (fe_03_01623-A-0058)
UM  (fe_03_01623-A-0059)
THE QUESTION TO ME IS WHETHER THE ENDS JUSTIFIED THE MEANS  (fe_03_01623-A-0060)
UM  (fe_03_01623-A-0061)
SHOULD WE HAVE GONE INTO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE I'M NOT SURE  (fe_03_01623-A-0062)
YOU KNOW IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT THAT UM  (fe_03_01623-A-0063)
WOULD SWING ME AT ALL WAS ONE OF SELF PROTECTION  (fe_03_01623-A-0065)
WHICH IS THERE MAY BE THESE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND TH- WE NEED TO GO IN TO DEAL WITH THIS  (fe_03_01623-A-0066)
BUT BEYOND THAT IT'S AS AS EVIL AS SADDAM HUSSEIN IS AS SOON AS WE WALK IN AND SAY  (fe_03_01623-A-0067)
THIS IS A BAD GOVERNMENT WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AH WE'RE GOING TO IMPOSE SOMETHING ELSE ON YOU WE'RE WALKING INTO TROUBLE  (fe_03_01623-A-0068)
MHM  (fe_03_01623-A-0069)
SECOND YEAH EVEN BETTER THEY'RE POTENTIALLY THE SECOND LARGEST OIL PRODUCER  (fe_03_01623-A-0070)

YEAH I I HEAR YOU I DON'T FEEL SO BAD ABOUT THAT THOUGH UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0015)
IT'S ALMOST TO ME A CASE OF THEY PROBABLY KNOW MORE THAN WHAT THEY'RE SAYING  (fe_03_01623-B-0016)
UM IF THERE'S ANY CYNICISM UPON ME IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT TOWARDS MR CHANEY I THINK AT LEAST DOWN HERE IN WASHINGTON  (fe_03_01623-B-0017)
HE'S PROBABLY THE LEAST CREDIBLE OUT OF THE GANG OF WHO'S RUNNING THINGS BUT YOU KNOW I THINK UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0018)
YOU KNOW I THINK THEY'RE SENDING A MESSAGE OVER THERE AND I THINK SO FAR IT'S GONE A HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO GO IN THE FIRST WEEK  (fe_03_01623-B-0019)
YOU KNOW I WAS LOOKING AT THIS THING AS AS YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO WIN A WAR IT'S VERY HARD TO WIN  (fe_03_01623-B-0020)
A CLASH OF CULTURES UNLESS YOU JUST WIPE SOMEBODY OUT AND WE CERTAINLY WEREN'T GOING TO DO THAT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A COMPLETE CL- CLASH OF CULTURES IN THE BEGINNING BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE GONE TO THAT AND UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0021)
[LIPSMACK] MAYBE IT WON'T I MEAN IT'S STILL A LITTLE EARLY TO TELL BUT WHO KNOWS WHERE ANY OF THE LEADERSHIP IS AND WHERE THEY'VE GONE AND SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE  (fe_03_01623-B-0022)
YEAH BUT I MEAN IN GENERAL  (fe_03_01623-B-0023)
MY KIND OF U._S. CENTRIC VIEW IS THAT IT'S ALMOST LIKE EVERYBODY IS SORT OF FIVE HUNDRED YEARS IN THE PAST WITH A VERY POSSIBLE MINORITY OF WHO WHO AREN'T AND UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0024)
THAT MAKES THINGS VERY DIFFICULT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN WITH VALUE SYSTEMS AND BELIEFS THAT  (fe_03_01623-B-0026)
THE U._S. HASN'T HELD TO IF NOT EVER AT LEAST FOR A COUPLE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS  (fe_03_01623-B-0027)
WELL I I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE I'VE BEEN TO THE MIDDLE EAST BUT AH  (fe_03_01623-B-0028)
MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN SOUTH EAST ASIA IS THAT IT'S GOING MORE TOWARDS ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY  (fe_03_01623-B-0029)
SO IN THAT SENSE  (fe_03_01623-B-0030)
MAYBE IT IS BECOMING MORE LIKE THE US I DON'T KNOW IF  (fe_03_01623-B-0031)
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S BENEFITING EVERYBODY OR JUST A SMALL MINORITY OF PEOPLE OR WHAT  (fe_03_01623-B-0032)
UM I THINK PROBABLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS CERTAINLY MORE SAVVY AND AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD THAN IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN AH  (fe_03_01623-B-0034)
WE WENT INTO VIETNAM BUT UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0035)
[LIPSMACK] UM LIKE I SAY I THINK HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL TURN OUT UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0036)
WILL IT HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE REST OF THE MIDDLE EAST IT MIGHT I MEAN IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE SYRIA IS STARTING TO  (fe_03_01623-B-0037)
COME OVER TO OUR SIDE AND NOT BE CONFRONTATIONAL RIGHT NOW UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0038)
MAYBE THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH US AH  (fe_03_01623-B-0039)
MAYBE THIS WILL  (fe_03_01623-B-0040)
UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0041)
MAYBE IT MAY DISRUPT SOME OF THE  (fe_03_01623-B-0042)
NONTHEOLOGICALLY  (fe_03_01623-B-0043)
UM CENTERED GOVERNMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND MAYBE THAT WILL BE A GOOD THING WE'LL SEE I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01623-B-0044)
YEAH UM MAYBE IF AH  (fe_03_01623-B-0045)
THE AH REGIME IS KICKED OUT AS IT APPARENTLY IS AND THEN WE LET EVERYBODY ELSE TAKE OVER MAYBE THEY WILL SORT OF REVERT TO A BETTER SYSTEM NOT NECESSARILY OURS OR ANYBODY ELSE'S AH  (fe_03_01623-B-0046)
YOU KNOW YOU COULD ALWAYS ARGUE THAT AH ALL OF THEIR DISSENT HAS BEEN  (fe_03_01623-B-0047)
AH SQUASHED OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS UM AND MAYBE THEY WILL [NOISE] FORM THEIR OWN SYSTEM THAT WILL BENEFIT THEIR PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01623-B-0048)
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT AND TO MAKE LIFE A HELL OF A LOT BETTER FOR ALL OF THEIR [NOISE] ALL OF THEIR PEOPLE I MEAN THEY HAVE THE THE  (fe_03_01623-B-0049)
YOU KNOW THEY CERTAINLY HAVE THE OIL THEY'RE WHAT THE THIRD LARGEST AH  (fe_03_01623-B-0050)

BACK IN THERE QUICKLY TO REFINANCE THE REBUILDING AND TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR ALL OF THE CITIZENS AND UM  (fe_03_01623-B-0054)
MAYBE IT WILL COME OUT OKAY YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THEY COULD DO WOULD BE THE SAME THING THAT DOUGLAS MCARTHUR DID IN AH IN OCCUPIED JAPAN [NOISE] ONE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DID WAS  (fe_03_01623-B-0055)
GIVE WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN JAPAN  (fe_03_01623-B-0056)
AND IF THEY DO THAT MOST OF THE TIME WOMEN VOTE FOR THINGS THAT THEY FEEL WILL IMPROVE THEIR FAMILY AND MAKE THE FUTURE BETTER FOR THEIR KIDS  (fe_03_01623-B-0057)
