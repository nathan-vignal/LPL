OKAY I CAN DO THAT [LAUGHTER] SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01630-A-0003)
I I'M KINDA I HAVE SIMILAR THOUGHTS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THAT IT WASN'T REALLY NECESSARY FOR US TO GO TO WAR  (fe_03_01630-A-0004)
I GUESS NOW THAT WE'RE THERE I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE TROOPS THAT ARE THERE AND YOU KNOW DO ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP THEIR FAMILIES  (fe_03_01630-A-0005)
AND JUST BUT I THINK IT'S JUST A WASTE OF OUR RESOURCES KINDA TO BE OVER THERE AND I DON'T  (fe_03_01630-A-0006)
I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S GONNA DO THAT MUCH GOOD I DOUBT THAT WE'LL EVER HAVE I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE EVER GONNA THINK HIGHLY OF AMERICANS OVER THERE BECAUSE WE'VE JUST BEEN INTERFERING IN THEIR LIVES FOR SO LONG  (fe_03_01630-A-0007)
DIFFERENCES  (fe_03_01630-A-0008)
YEAH BECAUSE I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW NOW THEY'RE GETTING ALL THIS HUMANITARIAN AID THAT'S GOING OVER THERE AND EVERYTHING I STILL THINK THAT THEY HATE US  (fe_03_01630-A-0009)
WELL AND IT SEEMS CRAZY TOO DID YOU KNOW THAT I JUST LEARNED THIS RECENTLY I GUESS I DON'T PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO WORLD AFFAIRS EITHER AND I DIDN'T EVEN REALISE THIS BUT AFTER WE'RE ALL DONE WE HAVE TO PAY TO REBUILD ALL OF THEIR COUNTRY ALL THE BUILDINGS WE BLEW UP AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01630-A-0010)
AND SO IT'S GOING TO END UP COSTING US A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY  (fe_03_01630-A-0011)
TO DO THAT  (fe_03_01630-A-0012)
YEAH I THINK WE MIGHT BE THERE A LONG TIME BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE STAYING THERE UNTIL THEY  (fe_03_01630-A-0013)
SUPPOSEDLY GET SOME SORT OF STABLE GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_01630-A-0014)
AND THAT COULD TAKE A WHILE  (fe_03_01630-A-0015)
SO  (fe_03_01630-A-0016)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01630-A-0017)
WELL AND SOMETIMES I THINK THAT MAYBE IT'S MORE  (fe_03_01630-A-0019)
THAT HE WANTED TO GO OVER THERE TO PROTECT THE OIL THAT WE MIGHT BE GETTING FROM THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF  (fe_03_01630-A-0020)
REALLY THAT HE JUST WANTED  (fe_03_01630-A-0021)
TO BE RID OF SADDAM OR THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE GONNA HAVE YOU KNOW WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AGAINST US OR SOMETHING SOMETIMES I THINK THAT THAT WAS JUST KIND OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THAT THEY WERE DOING OVER THERE EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE REALLY BEEN THE AGENDA  (fe_03_01630-A-0022)
SOMETIMES I WONDER  (fe_03_01630-A-0023)

RIGHT  (fe_03_01630-A-0025)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01630-A-0026)
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY YEARS OF HATRED AGAINST US THAT I'M SURE THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF OTHER PEOPLE WILLING TO STEP UP AND TAKE HIS PLACE  (fe_03_01630-A-0027)
WELL I THINK THAT  (fe_03_01630-A-0029)
NOW WE TEND TO KIND OF THINK WELL WHY ARE WE EVEN A MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA EVER BACK US UP OR HELP US YOU KNOW THEY WERE SO AGAINST IT  (fe_03_01630-A-0030)
I DON'T KNOW THEN ON THE OTHER HAND YOU THINK WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE WAITED LONGER AND LISTENED MORE TO WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH REASON TO GO FORWARD WITH THE WAR  (fe_03_01630-A-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01630-A-0032)
OH I THINK THAT THEY WERE BEHIND HIM I'M NOT SURE THOUGH  (fe_03_01630-A-0033)
BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALLY START PAYING THAT MUCH ATTENTION UNTIL WE WERE ACTUALLY AT WAR BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT OH THEY'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT IT BUT WE WON'T REALLY DO IT THAT'S WHAT I KEPT THINKING  (fe_03_01630-A-0034)

HARBORING SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE AFTER YOU KNOW THAT ESCAPED FROM IRAQ THAT THEY MIGHT BE HIDING OUT IN SYRIA AND IF THEY THEY'RE PROTECTING THEM THEN WE THEN YOU KNOW THEN WHAT WILL WE DO AND AND IT COULD GET TO BE ANOTHER MESS  (fe_03_01630-A-0040)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR POSITION IS  (fe_03_01630-A-0041)
YEAH YOU'D THINK SOME OF THOSE SURROUNDING COUNTRIES WOULD BE GLAD THAT WE'RE THERE  (fe_03_01630-A-0042)
BUT I DON'T KNOW THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE FEELINGS ABOUT US [LAUGHTER] THE PEOPLE IN IRAQ DO THAT THEY JUST THINK WE SHOULD MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS YOU KNOW AND STAY OUT OF THEIR COUNTRIES  (fe_03_01630-A-0043)

A LITTLE TOO MUCH AND AND THE WHOLE WAR WAS JUST A PRODUCT OF LIKE POOR PLANNING FROM THE GULF WAR  (fe_03_01630-B-0012)

AND WE SHOULD  (fe_03_01630-B-0025)
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT WE SHOULD JUST  (fe_03_01630-B-0026)

AT LEAST  (fe_03_01630-B-0047)
SAVING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN IRAQ  (fe_03_01630-B-0048)
I I KNOW THAT LIKE  (fe_03_01630-B-0049)
AS A  (fe_03_01630-B-0050)
AS A RESULT FROM A THEME THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE OPPRESSED BY SADDAM AND  (fe_03_01630-B-0051)
WHO NOW FEEL LIKE THEY'RE POLITICALLY FREE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS BUSH'S INTENTION I THINK IT WAS IT WAS A LOT OF OF LIKE FINANCIAL MOTIVATION AS FAR AS THE OIL  (fe_03_01630-B-0052)
AND AND JUST ARM- ARMAMENT SECURITY THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM BUILDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS  (fe_03_01630-B-0053)
IF THEY  (fe_03_01630-B-0054)
IF THEY WERE DESIGNING IT TO TO BE USED AGAINST THE U._S. I DON'T THINK HE HAD ANY LIKE HUMANITARIAN REASONS AT ALL  (fe_03_01630-B-0055)
AND  (fe_03_01630-B-0056)
I DON'T EVEN LIKE ONCE  (fe_03_01630-B-0057)
IF WE DO FIND ALL THE  (fe_03_01630-B-0058)
THE TOP WANTED PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THAT DECK OF CARDS THAT THEY HAVE ISSUED HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SOMEBODY ELSE ISN'T GOING TO RAISE TO POWER THAT THAT IS JUST LIKE SADDAM HUSSEIN  (fe_03_01630-B-0059)
YEAH AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT IS LIKE WE WENT INTO THIS WAR WITHOUT ANY SANCTIONS OR OR ANY SUPPORT WHATSOEVER EXCEPT FOR FOR BRITAIN  (fe_03_01630-B-0060)
AND AND WE DID WHAT WE WANTED TO DO YOU THINK LIKE THE OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE FRANCE AND RUSSIA AND GERMANY THEY'RE  (fe_03_01630-B-0061)
THERE'S GONNA SOMEHOW KEEP THIS IN THEIR HEADS LATER ON AND AND EITHER UNITE AGAINST US OR JUST HAVE THIS FEAR OF US  (fe_03_01630-B-0062)
FOR THE REST OF I DON'T KNOW HOWEVER THE UNITED NATIONS LONG THEY MAY LAST  (fe_03_01630-B-0063)

WE CAN GO AHEAD AND  (fe_03_01630-B-0070)
AND RUN INTO ANY COUNTRY THAT WE FEEL IS A THREAT LIKE UM AFGHANISTAN OR  (fe_03_01630-B-0071)
OR IRAQ AND  (fe_03_01630-B-0072)
AND PULL THE STRINGS HOWEVER WE WANT WHETHER IT'S LIKE COVERTLY OR WHETHER WE  (fe_03_01630-B-0073)
DECLARE AN ALL RIGHT ALL OUT WAR AND I THINK THAT  (fe_03_01630-B-0074)

DO YOU KNOW IF ISRAEL IS SUPPORTING US IN ANY OF THIS I I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD ANYTHING FROM THEM  (fe_03_01630-B-0079)

GLOBALLY  (fe_03_01630-B-0086)
YEAH WELL I  (fe_03_01630-B-0087)
I THINK THE ONLY REASON WHY WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT IS JUST  (fe_03_01630-B-0088)
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT THAT WOULD BE A THREAT TO  (fe_03_01630-B-0089)
LIKE THE UNITED STATES DOING THIS IS THE UNITED STATES I'M SURE LIKE A LOT OF VOTERS WOULD BE AGAINST THAT  (fe_03_01630-B-0090)
BUT I DON'T SEE ANY ANY WAY OF STOPPING IF WE  (fe_03_01630-B-0091)
IF WE DECIDED TO INVADE ANY COUNTRY LIKE CHINA OR NORTH KOREA I'M SURE NORTH KOREA WOULDN'T PUT UP MUCH OF A FIGHT  (fe_03_01630-B-0092)
IT'S IT'S KIND OF SCARY  (fe_03_01630-B-0093)
