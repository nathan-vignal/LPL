WE DON'T HAVE TO PUSH DEMOCRACY OR OUR  (fe_03_01663-A-0021)
OUR THING OF LIVING ON ON THIS COUNTRY  (fe_03_01663-A-0022)

SO  (fe_03_01663-A-0033)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-A-0034)
I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THE UNITED STATES IS NOT WELL LIKED IS OUR EGO  (fe_03_01663-A-0035)
WE GO OVERSEAS WE GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND WE KIND OF AH QUOTE UNQUOTE THROW OUR WEIGHT AROUND AND THINK I'M FROM THE UNITED STATES BOW DOWN TO ME OR OR UM  (fe_03_01663-A-0036)

WHO AGREES WITH  (fe_03_01663-A-0066)
MY VIEWS BECAUSE OUT HERE I THINK I'M ALMOST SCARED TO ADMIT SOME OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT'S SO TOTALLY  (fe_03_01663-A-0067)

IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND I MEAN WHO WANTS TO COME AND BOMB SOMETHING HERE THERE'S NOTHING HERE TO YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] REALLY  (fe_03_01663-A-0070)
SO I THINK THAT HAS PUT US SOME PEOPLE OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY  (fe_03_01663-A-0071)
SO ANYWAY HAVE YOU UM [MN] SO WHAT ELSE WERE WE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT I FORGOT ALREADY  (fe_03_01663-A-0072)
MM [LAUGHTER] YEAH IT'S IT'S A SMALL RURAL COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUT YOU KNOW I I STILL THINK OF THIS THING ABOUT THE WAR THAT MAYBE WE NEE- NEEDN'T HAVE GONE IN I'M GLAD IT'S OVER WITH SO  (fe_03_01663-A-0073)
AND I'M GLAD GLAD THE LOSS OF LIFE WAS MINIMAL  (fe_03_01663-A-0074)
I'M GLAD THE TECHNOLOGY WAS THERE THAT UM  (fe_03_01663-A-0075)
LOSS OF LIFE COULD BE MINIMIZED AN- AND YOU KNOW THIS REALLY WAS A SEVEN EIGHT DAY WAR  (fe_03_01663-A-0076)
INSTEAD OF FOUR YEARS LIKE THE PREVIOUS WORLD WARS HAVE BEEN  (fe_03_01663-A-0077)
AND UM I WASN'T REAL PLEASED WITH THE MEDIA BEING ALMOST THERE BEFORE  (fe_03_01663-A-0078)
THE REST OF THE PEOPLE WERE THERE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01663-A-0079)
UM [MN] I THOUGHT THEY COULD HAVE KEPT SOME THINGS SEPARATE AND WE DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW AS MUCH AS WE KNEW  (fe_03_01663-A-0080)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01663-A-0081)

MHM  (fe_03_01663-B-0008)
WELL I DON'T KNOW LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK DO YOU BECAUSE I'M I HAVE MY OWN THEORY ABOUT IT BUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT IT PEOPLE START GETTING VERY VERY ANGRY  (fe_03_01663-B-0009)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01663-B-0010)
MHM  (fe_03_01663-B-0011)
MM  (fe_03_01663-B-0012)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-B-0013)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-B-0014)
I THINK WE GOT REALLY REALLY LUCKY THAT THE WAR WENT BY VERY QUICKLY THAT THE PEOPLE WERE VERY WILLING TO PUT THEIR ARMS DOWN AND NOT GET KILLED FOR IT AND THAT NOW THIS LIKE RECONSTRUCTION IS COMING THROUGH RELATIVELY SMOOTHLY  (fe_03_01663-B-0016)
WE'RE ALSO VERY LUCKY THAT IT'S STARTING TO SLOWLY GET THE ECONOMY AND SO PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FOCUS ON THE RIGHT THINGS NOW BUT  (fe_03_01663-B-0017)
I THINK WE ALSO THINK WE SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE IN IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS IS JUST LIKE OKAY YOU MAY HAVE WON THE BATTLE BUT YOU HAVEN'T WON THE WAR KIND OF THING  (fe_03_01663-B-0018)
BECAUSE OF THE INITIAL REASONS THAT BUSH WAS EVEN SAYING THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO INTO THE WAR WAS FOR TERRORISM AND HE STILL HAS NOT MADE ANY LINK THAT PUTS TERRORISM WITH IRAQ OR EVEN SADDAM  (fe_03_01663-B-0019)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-B-0020)
IT'S J- JUST REALLY LUCKY THAT HE HAS VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE BEHIND HIM BECAUSE THIS IS BASICALLY OTHER THAN A BOY'S WHIM TURNED INTO AH LIKE OIL  (fe_03_01663-B-0021)
WHICH I TOTALLY CANNOT STAND THAT BUT LIKE A- WE'RE HERE WE ARE NOW AND WE'RE HERE AT THE POINT WHERE THE SO CALLED WAR IS OVER ALTHOUGH HE CANNOT FIND SADDAM CHANCES ARE HE'S PROBABLY BEEN LIKE RETIRED IN SOME ISLAND SOMEWHERE BE LIKE OH THANKS YOU'VE DONE YOUR JOB  (fe_03_01663-B-0022)
[NOISE] BUT LIKE I THINK ONCE OF THAT NOW THAT YOU'VE STARTED YOUR PROCESS IT'S ALSO GOOD TO FINISH IT  (fe_03_01663-B-0023)
SO NOW THAT THEY'RE HERE I THINK YES THEY SHOULD DO THEIR BEST WITH HELPING THE IRAQI PEOPLE INSTILL THEIR OWN KIND OF RULE AND LAW THE WAY THEY WANT IT AND THEN LEAVE  (fe_03_01663-B-0024)
AGREED  (fe_03_01663-B-0025)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-B-0026)
MHM  (fe_03_01663-B-0027)
YEAH DEFINITELY  (fe_03_01663-B-0028)
I KNOW  (fe_03_01663-B-0029)
I MEAN  (fe_03_01663-B-0030)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-B-0031)
HA JUST LIKE SADDAM [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01663-B-0032)
YEAH I KNOW LIKE EVEN JUST TO GO ON I REMEMBER WHEN THE WAR WAS GOING ON WHERE PEOPLE LIKE WILL THEY MAKE IT WILL THEY NOT MAKE IT AND THEN HOW THEY WERE JUST HITTING ON IRAQIS LIKE THEY WERE ANIMALS WHO JUS-  (fe_03_01663-B-0034)
LIKE EVEN I THINK I HEAR OVER THERE SOME STORIES OF AH IRAQIS GETTING SHOT UP WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOOTING OR TRYING TO LIKE GET SOME TOGETHER OR THERE WAS SOME KIND OF GUERILLA WARFARE GOING ON IN BETWEEN THERE  (fe_03_01663-B-0035)
BUT I THINK AH IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE COME IN AND WE'VE HELPED THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER OPPRESSION FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW LIKE EVERY THIRD WORLD COUNTRY ALTHOUGH THEY'VE BEEN UNDER A CERTAIN CONDITION THESE PEOPLE STILL HAVE MINDS AND FEELINGS  (fe_03_01663-B-0036)
SO YOU CAN'T GO AROUND LIKE TREATING THEM LIKE ANIMALS WE'RE LIKE OKAY WE'RE GOING TO COME UP HERE AND SAVE YOU AND DO WHATEVER WE WANT WHICH I THINK MM  (fe_03_01663-B-0037)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01663-B-0038)
GOOD POINT  (fe_03_01663-B-0039)
THAT IS TRUE MM  (fe_03_01663-B-0040)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-B-0041)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-B-0042)
I MEAN PEOPLE ARE NO DIFFERENT EVEN THOUGH LIKE WE HAVE THANKFULLY MORE TECHNOLOGY AND A BETTER PERIOD OF LIVING AND MANY AMERICANS THINK OH MY LIFE IS THIS AND THAT BUT COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY WELL OFF  (fe_03_01663-B-0043)
AND THEN WHEN YOU START LIKE THINKING OH WE'RE MUCH BETTER THAN THEM IN REALITY YOU'RE NOT BECAUSE A HUMAN PERSON IS A HUMAN PERSON YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE  (fe_03_01663-B-0044)
MM  (fe_03_01663-B-0045)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01663-B-0046)
RIGHT I'M SORT OF AN INTERNATIONAL PERSON MYSELF  (fe_03_01663-B-0047)
YEAH [LAUGHTER] SO UM I I SEE BOTH SIDES 'CAUSE I'VE LIVED OUTSIDE AMERICA FOR A LONG TIME AND I'VE LIVED INSIDE AMERICA FOR A LONG TIME ACTUALLY EIGHT YEARS EACH TO BE EXACT  (fe_03_01663-B-0048)
BUT I MEAN LIKE JUST LOOKING YOU'RE RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LIKE THERE ARE AMERICANS WHO ARE INTELLIGENT THEY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON LIKE THEY'RE THEY'RE OF THE P- THE POINT OF VIEW  (fe_03_01663-B-0049)
THAT LIKE OKAY THIS IS WHO WE ARE BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR OTHER CULTURES AND UNDERSTANDINGS AND WE SHOULD RESPECT THEM FOR IT  (fe_03_01663-B-0050)
THIS IS REALLY FUNNY 'CAUSE WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE ALL ABOUT RESPECT ME RESPECT ME RESPECT ME RESPECT ME IT WAS LIKE A CATCHPHRASE EVERY SINGLE T._V. SHOW H- HAD THE WORDS RESPECT IN IT  (fe_03_01663-B-0051)
BUT LIKE OVER HERE RIGHT NOW THE ACTIONS THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING AND HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE POPULATION WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS NOT RESPECTFUL  (fe_03_01663-B-0052)
I MEAN IT'S JUST I DON'T KNOW LIKE D- AH WELL SPOILS MY POINT I MEAN LIKE JUST COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE AND COMING FROM THE INSIDE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME AMERICANS WHO ARE JUST LIKE OH THIS IS WHO I AM AND 'SPECIALLY UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH THAT WAS ON THE RISE  (fe_03_01663-B-0054)
THEY WERE TOTALLY THERE LIKE GOING OH WE DON'T CARE THIS THAT I MEAN THERE'S SORT OF LESS NOW  (fe_03_01663-B-0055)
B- BUT WITH THIS LIKE UM WAR BEING LIKE SUCCESSFUL AND EVERYTHING I REALLY HOPE PEOPLE WON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF STARTING TO START BEING BIG AGAIN BECAUSE THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS ARE STILL OUT THERE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW THEY MIGHT GET IRKED INTO DOING SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_01663-B-0056)
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY'RE DOING NOR DO I WANT TO BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA WAIT 'TIL THINGS HAVE CALMED DOWN AND EVERYONE'S LIKE GOING NAH NAH NAH AGAIN THEN THEY'LL PROBABLY FIND SOME OTHER WAY OF DOING IT  (fe_03_01663-B-0058)
YES BUT IN THE WRONG WAY  (fe_03_01663-B-0059)
IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS  (fe_03_01663-B-0060)
IT WAS LIKE IT WAS SORT OF  (fe_03_01663-B-0061)
DECENT IN THAT WE WERE ALL THINKING WHY  (fe_03_01663-B-0062)
AH AND THEN ONCE WE FOUND THE ANSWER IT SEEMS THAT HALF OF US DIDN'T ACCEPT IT AND WENT THE OTHER WAY WHILE THE OTHER WERE LIKE OH AND STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01663-B-0063)
IF ONLY WE HAD KIND OF LIKE STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT IT MORE AND BE LIKE WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHY AS AND AS AS WE'VE BEEN PREACHING OF DEMOCRACY AND EVERYTHING AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01663-B-0064)
THEN MAYBE THAT WON'T THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A RUSH BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH ALL THAT BLOODSHED GOING ON I EVEN SPOKE TO SOMEONE NEXT TO ME WHO HAD SEEN WHO WAS SO CLOSE TO THE BUILDING THAT THEY SAW THE COLOR OF THE SHOES OF THE PERSON FALLING OFF OF THE BUILDING  (fe_03_01663-B-0065)
YES IT WAS LIKE THAT BAD I MEAN F- FOR THAT KIND OF THING TO HAPPEN YES THEY HAD TO BE PUNISHED  (fe_03_01663-B-0066)
BUT BY GOD  (fe_03_01663-B-0067)
LIKE I- IT WOULD IT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM BELIEVE ME BUT AH BUT THE WAY WE WENT AROUND IT IT WASN'T THAT GOOD  (fe_03_01663-B-0068)
WELL IN MINNESOTA I COULD IMAGINE  (fe_03_01663-B-0070)
MM  (fe_03_01663-B-0071)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_01663-B-0073)
MM  (fe_03_01663-B-0074)
THAT'S TRUE OH MY BUT I MEAN  (fe_03_01663-B-0077)
OH NO IT'S KIND OF HARD SINCE YOU'VE SINCE YOU'RE IN THE PLACE WHERE LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY SAFE AND YOU HAVE YOUR COMMUNITIES AND EVERYONE KIND OF THINKS ALONG LIKE A SIMILAR FASHION  (fe_03_01663-B-0078)
AND JUST TRYING TO LIKE THINK DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLE I THINK YEAH I I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT  (fe_03_01663-B-0079)
MM  (fe_03_01663-B-0080)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01663-B-0081)
TRUE  (fe_03_01663-B-0083)
YEAH THAT ALSO BOTHERED ME [LAUGHTER] VERY MUCH SO  (fe_03_01663-B-0084)
MHM YEAH I MEAN LIKE IF IT WAS SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THE MEDIA THAT WAS KIND OF UNFAIR AND BAD THA- THAT'S WHAT THE MEDIA'S SUPPOSED TO BE FOR TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE EQUALIZED BUT THEN TO GO OUT AND EXPLOIT EVERY SINGLE ANGLE JUST TO GET MORE RATINGS I THINK WAS ACTUALLY DISGUSTING  (fe_03_01663-B-0085)
