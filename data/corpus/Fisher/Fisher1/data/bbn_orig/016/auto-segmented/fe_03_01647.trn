I CAN'T REALLY FORM A TRUE OPINION ON THIS I JUST UM  (fe_03_01647-A-0065)
YOU KNOW I JUST KEEP FLOATING BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH AND MAYBE MAYBE IT'S TOO A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT I WANT AND WHAT I DON'T WANT MIXED IN  (fe_03_01647-A-0066)

RIGHT ONE OF MY FRIENDS  (fe_03_01647-A-0071)
YEAH ONE OF MY FRIENDS KIND OF FEELS THAT UM  (fe_03_01647-A-0072)
WE ACTUALLY WENT IN THERE BECAUSE WE COULD NOT TARGET THE ONES THAT GOT US FROM NINE ELEVEN  (fe_03_01647-A-0073)
HELLO  (fe_03_01647-B-0001)
HI MY NAME'S KAREN SAO  (fe_03_01647-B-0002)
OH WHERE DO YOU WORK  (fe_03_01647-B-0003)
OH I WORK IN AN ENGINEERING COMPANY AND IT'S PART OF HORIZON [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] SO AH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE SITUATION [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01647-B-0004)
MHM  (fe_03_01647-B-0005)
MHM  (fe_03_01647-B-0007)
MHM DO YOU THINK IT'S DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTRY IS INVOLVED I MEAN I HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS FOR WHETHER IT'S ISRAEL OR IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST  (fe_03_01647-B-0008)
MHM  (fe_03_01647-B-0009)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01647-B-0010)
SURE WELL PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT ONE CAN TELL IS CORRECT  (fe_03_01647-B-0011)
SO WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING VERY CONCLUSIVE PUBLISHED THAT ONE KNOWS I MEAN CERTAINLY COLIN POWELL MADE THIS CLAIM TO THE ENTIRE UNITED NATIONS  (fe_03_01647-B-0012)
AND PROVIDED SOME RATHER PERSUASIVE INFORMA- PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE UM  (fe_03_01647-B-0013)
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE FOUND ANY MA- WEAPONS YET AND I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY COULD FIND THEM THEY WERE VERY THEY WOULD BE INCREDIBLY EASY TO HIDE  (fe_03_01647-B-0014)
PIECES AND TAKE LAB EQUIPMENT APART AND HIDE CHEMICALS I MEAN THEY HAVE A WHOLE COUNTRY TO HIDE THEM I MEAN CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE UNITED STATES YOU'D NEVER FIND IT  (fe_03_01647-B-0015)
SO I DON'T KNOW [LAUGHTER] I WAS NEVER SURE WHAT THE REASON WAS FOR GOING INTO IRAQ I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER SAID IT THEY SAY THINGS LIKE THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF SADDAM HUSSEIN THEY KEPT SAYING THERE WERE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION  (fe_03_01647-B-0016)
UM [LIPSMACK] I OFTEN THINK THAT THE REASON THEY WANTED TO GO IN WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THAT HUSSEIN WOULD DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST  (fe_03_01647-B-0017)
THE THE WEAPONS HE HAS EVEN THOUGH MISSILES THAT THEY FOUND AND SO FORTH WHATEVER THEY DID FIND AH STRUCK ME AS NOT POTEN- POSING ANY DANGER AT ALL TO THE UNITED STATES BUT I'M SURE TURKEY  (fe_03_01647-B-0018)
UM SHOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY WORRIED [LAUGHTER] THE LOCAL COUNTRIES SHOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HIM AND AH I I WAS THINKING THAT WAS WHY WE WENT IN GETTING RID OF HUSSEIN WAS PROBABLY A GOOD THING  (fe_03_01647-B-0019)
MHM YOU MEAN TER- ANTI TERRORIST  (fe_03_01647-B-0020)
MHM  (fe_03_01647-B-0021)
CERTAINLY WE'RE MAKING MORE ENEMIES FOR OURSELVES  (fe_03_01647-B-0022)
I'M WONDERING WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE IN THE AFTERMATH TO CREATE ENVIRONMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE WE CAN MAKE FRIENDS UM  (fe_03_01647-B-0023)
[LAUGHTER] I DON'T THINK THAT THEY APPRECIATE WHAT WE DID AT ALL [LAUGHTER] I'M NOT SURE THEY THINK IT WAS A GOOD THING PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE INVADED THEIR COUNTRY HAVE THEIR COUNTRIES INVADED  (fe_03_01647-B-0024)
UM  (fe_03_01647-B-0025)
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE WRONG THING TO ME  (fe_03_01647-B-0026)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01647-B-0027)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_01647-B-0028)
I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION  (fe_03_01647-B-0029)
MHM  (fe_03_01647-B-0030)
RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF CONFLICTING OPINION LOTS OF CONFLICTING EVIDENCE AND OF COURSE NOBODY CAN FORESEE THE FUTURE  (fe_03_01647-B-0031)
THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY HADN'T GONE IN  (fe_03_01647-B-0032)
SO YOU ARE HAVING TO COMPARE THIS IT'S JUST SORT OF LIKE ASKING SOMEBODY DO YOU THINK YOU MADE THE RIGHT CAREER CHOICE  (fe_03_01647-B-0033)
YOU KNOW DID YOU DID YOU GO TO THE RIGHT COLLEGE WHO  (fe_03_01647-B-0035)
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED YOU KNOW SHOULD IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AN OBVIOUS HORRENDOUS DISASTER YET THAT MAKES IT CLEARLY WRONG AT LEAST NEAR TERM  (fe_03_01647-B-0037)
EVEN IF THINGS HAD GONE BADLY IT COULD STILL HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE THE RIGHT THING WHEN SOMEBODY FROM A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW LOOKS AT IT WILL SAY OH IT WAS A REALLY GOOD THING  (fe_03_01647-B-0038)
AH I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01647-B-0039)
WELL TECHNOLOGY IS MAKING QUITE A DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_01647-B-0041)
UM  (fe_03_01647-B-0042)
MHM  (fe_03_01647-B-0043)
WELL HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BECOME FRIENDS I MEAN I NOTICE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_01647-B-0044)
UH IN OUR COLLEGES AND AND  (fe_03_01647-B-0045)
MHM AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE SHOULD MAKE FRIENDS WITH AND THEN THEY CAN GO BACK AND SPREAD THE WORD AND ACT AS SORT OF A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE CULTURES  (fe_03_01647-B-0047)
UM THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE I MEAN I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO CONVERT ANYBODY IN THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS FROM THEIR POSITION TO OURS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01647-B-0048)
I THINK THE THING THAT WORRIES ME MOST ACTUALLY ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ IS ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES WE NEGLECTED IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE BEEN IGNORING AFGHANISTAN AND MEXICO AND NORTH KOREA AND AFRICA ALL THE COUNTRIES IN AFRICA WHICH IT'S NOT A COUNTRY IT'S A CONTINENT BUT  (fe_03_01647-B-0050)
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS [LAUGHTER] THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WATCHING AT THE SAME TIME  (fe_03_01647-B-0051)
ONE AT A TIME THAT COULD BE  (fe_03_01647-B-0052)
WELL I MEAN HE IS CERTAINLY  (fe_03_01647-B-0053)
BURNING POLITICAL BRIDGES WITH MEXICO AND I THINK DID YOU SEE THE ARTICLE IN THE GLOBE THAT SAID THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY THAT HAS FOUND A LOT OF OIL RESERVES THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO AVOID TURNING INTO A  (fe_03_01647-B-0054)
COUNTRY WITH A CORRUPT TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_01647-B-0055)
IT WAS FUNNY IT'S SORT OF AND AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S TRUE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THOSE OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T DEVELOP ANY OTHER RESOURCES OR INDUSTRIES  (fe_03_01647-B-0056)
AND THE OIL IS CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH MAKES YOU KNOW GIVES THEM LOTS OF MONEY AND NO REASON TO SHARE AND THE PEOPLE ARE SATISFIED BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS NICE EASY LIFESTYLE AND SO THEY END UP WITH A A UM  (fe_03_01647-B-0057)
DESPOTIC  (fe_03_01647-B-0058)
GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE JUST SORT OF DON'T MIND BECAUSE THEY ARE WELL TAKEN CARE OF [LAUGHTER] AND THEY HAVE NO OTHER INDUSTRY SO THEY HAVE BASICALLY VERY VERY WELL TO DO GOVERNMENT AND RELATIVELY POOR POPULOUS  (fe_03_01647-B-0059)
UM BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DEVELOPING OTHER PROFESSIONS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THEY ARE ALL DEPENDENT ON THE OIL [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01647-B-0060)
AND THEN EVERYBODY BRIBES EVERYBODY TO GET ACCESS TO THE OIL AND THE MONEY THAT COMES WITH IT  (fe_03_01647-B-0061)
SO THEY SAID THAT IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO CREATE A DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ OR ANYTHING APPROACHING A FAIR GOVERNMENT A FAIR COUNT- A FAIR COMMUNITY THERE  (fe_03_01647-B-0062)
I THOUGHT THAT THAT DIDN'T BOLD WELL [LAUGHTER] SO WE WILL SEE HOW THEY ARE DOING THAT SO WHAT DID WHAT DID MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS THINK  (fe_03_01647-B-0063)
I KNOW MOST OF THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH AND THE PEOPLE I KNOW NOBODY EVERYBODY SORT OF SAYS GEE IT'S HARD TO KNOW I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO WAR YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT IT DOESN'T SEEM WRONG [LAUGHTER] IT'S JUST LIKE EVERYBODY WANTED HUSSEIN TO GO AWAY [MN]  (fe_03_01647-B-0066)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01647-B-0067)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01647-B-0068)
UH-HUH YEAH [MN]  (fe_03_01647-B-0069)
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY JUST HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS BECAUSE IT ISN'T A SIMPLE QUESTION IT  (fe_03_01647-B-0070)
ISN'T PEOPLE WEREN'T BEING ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE HUSSEIN REMOVED THEY ARE BEING ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LONG TERM IMPACT WILL BE OF HAVING PUT MILITARY PEOPLE INTO YOU KNOW U._S. MILITARY INTO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND OUSTED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_01647-B-0071)
AND THAT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ATTACKED US IN WHICH CASE PEOPLE WOULD EASILY HAVE SORT OF A RIGHT AND WRONG REACTION THEY'D SAY OH IT'S RIGHT TO DEFEND YOURSELF BUT YOU KNOW IS IT RIGHT TO GO IN AND REMOVE ANOTHER COUNTRY'S  (fe_03_01647-B-0072)
UM DUSTMEN I DON'T YOU KNOW A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT PERSON IS THAT A IS THAT A GOOD THING ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T INVITED YOU TO GO DO IT AH  (fe_03_01647-B-0073)
IT'S HARD HARD  (fe_03_01647-B-0074)
