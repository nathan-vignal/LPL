[LAUGHTER] THAT'S OKAY  (fe_03_01682-B-0003)
UM WELL I ACTUALLY CAN GIVE AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW I'M AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FROM INDIA AND I'M DOING MY M._B._A. HERE  (fe_03_01682-B-0004)
SO THE OPINION I WHAT I FEEL ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST IS THAT IT'S PROBABLY A LEGACY OF THE PAST LIKE WHAT THE BRITISH LEFT BEHIND AND THEY PROBABLY LEFT IT FOR THE U._S. TO SORT IT OUT  (fe_03_01682-B-0005)
BECAUSE THE BRITISH JUST LEFT IN A HAPHAZARD WAY DRAWING ARBITRARY LINES AND I THINK IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF YOU KNOW BEING TRYING TO INCITE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET BACK AT ISRAEL I DON'T THINK THAT'S UH  (fe_03_01682-B-0006)
THAT'S I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VALID REASON FOR GOING AFTER THE ISRAELIS  (fe_03_01682-B-0007)
UH BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY'S ENTITLED TO HIS OR THEIR HOMELAND  (fe_03_01682-B-0008)
MHM OH WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01682-B-0009)
MHM  (fe_03_01682-B-0010)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01682-B-0011)
YEAH IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH I MEAN PROBABLY THERE CAN BE PEACE BUT FOR THAT EVERYBODY THE ISRAELIS AS AS WELL AS THE ARAB WORLD THEY PROBABLY HAVE TO MAKE SO MANY CONCESSIONS THAT WHICH PROBABLY NEITHER NEITHER OF THE SIDES ARE WILLING TO MAKE  (fe_03_01682-B-0013)
WE FACED THE SAME SITUATION BACK HOME IN INDIA LIKE WE HAVE FOUGHT THREE WARS WITH PAKISTAN OVER KASHMIR WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ISSUE OF LAND  (fe_03_01682-B-0014)
AND UM I DON'T SEE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN RESOLVE IT BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MUCH EGO AT STAKE PEOPLE DON'T LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE THEY ONLY LOOK AT YOU KNOW LIKE EGO OF NATIONALISTIC FEELINGS LIKE WILL WE WIN THE NEXT ELECTION IF WE TAKE THIS STEP  (fe_03_01682-B-0015)
IT'S IT'S TOO SHORT SIGHTED THAT'S WHAT I FEEL  (fe_03_01682-B-0016)
AND PLUS THE U._S. HAS [MN]  (fe_03_01682-B-0017)
I MEAN  (fe_03_01682-B-0018)
BEING THE ONLY SUPERPOWER LEFT IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW IT- IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TAKE THAT STEP BECAUSE AS YOU SAW ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WHAT HAPPENED THIS THESE THINGS WILL KEEP ON HAPPENING IF THE U._S. DOES NOT TAKE A YOU KNOW POSITIVE ROUTE  (fe_03_01682-B-0019)
I MEAN PRESIDENT BUSH I THINK HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY CRITICIZED FOR HAVING TAKEN EXTREME MEASURES AS LIKE GOING AFTER IRAQ BUT  (fe_03_01682-B-0020)
I MEAN IF YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE BETWEEN SEEING YOUR OWN COUNTRYMEN DIE AND SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE'S COUNTRYMEN DIE I THINK IT PREFERABLE FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE TO DIE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR OWN COUNTRY TO BE AT DANGER ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_01682-B-0021)
IT'S I SEE IT AS SIMPLE AS THAT I MEAN I AM FROM INDIA I AM I MEAN I DON'T I CAN'T TAKE SIDES I MEAN I'M HERE IN THE U._S. STUDYING IT'S NOT THAT I'M SAYING THIS I'M PRO U._S. JUST BECAUSE I'M HERE BUT I THINK IF I WAS  (fe_03_01682-B-0022)
INDIA I WOULD DO THE SAME  (fe_03_01682-B-0023)
THING I MEAN I WOULD ATTACK THE OTHER COUNTRY HAVING SEEN HAVING SEEN MY PEOPLE DIE I  (fe_03_01682-B-0024)
MEAN WHAT HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH WAS HUGE  (fe_03_01682-B-0025)
YES SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE  (fe_03_01682-B-0026)
HE DOESN'T HAVE MANY A LOT OF CHOICE AND THAT'S WHAT UH I THINK  (fe_03_01682-B-0027)
THE AMERICANS I THINK THE PUBLIC THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AT LEAST UNDERSTANDS THAT I MEAN I JUST GO BY THE SUPPORT THAT HE HAS BY C._N._N. AND ALL THE GALLUP POLLS THAT THEY KEEP ON DOING SO I THAT'S KIND OF I THINK THAT SHOULD BE HEARTENING FOR THEM THAT AT LEAST THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS SUPPORTING HIM  (fe_03_01682-B-0028)
AND THE SECOND ISSUE IS PROBABLY I THINK THE BIGGER ONE WAS THE OIL THAT'S THERE WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE WORLD  (fe_03_01682-B-0029)
AND THAT'S A VERY BIG ISSUE AND I WOULDN'T FAULT AGAIN I WOULDN'T FAULT PRESIDENT BUSH FOR GOING AFTER THE OIL I MEAN IT'S IT'S A RESOURCE FULL OF OIL AND SOMEBODY GOT TO MAKE USE OF IT  (fe_03_01682-B-0030)
[LAUGHTER] BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST  (fe_03_01682-B-0031)
PEOPLE JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S UH IT'S JUST ECONOMIC AND NOTHING ELSE BUT IT'S GONE FAR BEYOND ECONOMICS NOW WHEN YOU SEE SO MANY PEOPLE DIE  (fe_03_01682-B-0032)
WELL I THINK THEY SHOULD BE THERE FOR A LONGER TIME JUST SO THAT THIS DOESN'T FLARE UP AGAIN  (fe_03_01682-B-0033)
BECAUSE AS YOU ARE SEEING IN AFGHANISTAN THE U._S. IS NOT COMPLETELY OUT OF IT BUT THEY ARE PROBABLY HANDING IT OVER POWER A BIT TOO EARLY TO THE AFGHANIS AND PROBLEMS AND YOU KNOW CONTROLLING THEIR OWN PEOPLE  (fe_03_01682-B-0034)
SO PROBABLY THE U._S. SHOULD SHOULD STAY THERE  (fe_03_01682-B-0035)
YEAH BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SEND YOUR TROOPS AGAIN TO A PLACE LIKE IRAQ I DON'T I MEAN  (fe_03_01682-B-0038)
PEOPLE HAVE LOST FOCUS OF THE WORLD JUST BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT EVERYTHING IS  (fe_03_01682-B-0039)
ALL SO HUNKY DORY BUT I THINK  (fe_03_01682-B-0040)
THERE'S STILL SOME GRAVE DANGER TO THE TROOPS OUT THERE  (fe_03_01682-B-0041)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01682-B-0042)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT US TO TALK ABOUT JUST TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST  (fe_03_01682-B-0043)
YEAH AND I THINK THE KEY TO THE MIDDLE EAST I MEAN THE PR- THE PEACE OR WHATEVER PRESIDENT BUSH IS STRIVING FOR IT PROBABLY LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE ISRAELIS MORE THAN HIMSELF  (fe_03_01682-B-0044)
YOU KNOW LIKE GOING AFTER THE ISRAELIS AND MAKING THEM MAKE SOME HUGE CONCESSIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO REALLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SACRIFICES IF THEY WANT TO SEE LASTING PEACE  (fe_03_01682-B-0047)
I THINK THAT'S WHY THE CONTRIBUTION OF PRESIDENT RABIN WOULD HAVE BEEN CRITICAL HAD HE BEEN ALIVE TODAY  (fe_03_01682-B-0048)
BUT UNFORTUNATELY [LAUGHTER] THAT'S THE WAY THINGS GO  (fe_03_01682-B-0049)
IT JUST TAKES A BULLET TO YOU KNOW JUST DELAY THE WHOLE PROCESS  (fe_03_01682-B-0050)
