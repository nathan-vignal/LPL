IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO PLAY A ROLE BUT I WORRY ABOUT CHARGING IN AND TRYING TO DO TOO MUCH  (fe_03_01660-A-0004)
RATHER THAN HAVING MORE OF A GUIDANCE ROLE  (fe_03_01660-A-0005)

AND THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO  (fe_03_01660-A-0046)
GOING TO BASE YOUR GOVERNMENT ON YOUR MORAL BELIEFS AND THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01660-A-0047)
