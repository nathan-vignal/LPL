IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE [MN]  (fe_03_01654-A-0019)
WELL  (fe_03_01654-A-0021)
IF WE ARE TO STAY INVOLVED BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF ENEMIES AROUND THERE  (fe_03_01654-A-0022)
I MEAN EVENTUALLY IF YOU LEAVE 'EM ALONE LONG ENOUGH THEY'LL BUILD UP THEY WILL EVENTUALLY COME AFTER US  (fe_03_01654-A-0023)

THEY'LL JUST EVENTUALLY FIGURE IT OUT AND SAY HM LET'S CALL A TRUCE FOR FIVE MINUTES AND GO BOMB AMERICA  (fe_03_01654-A-0026)
YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN WORLD WAR TWO  (fe_03_01654-A-0027)

EVIL CRONIES  (fe_03_01654-A-0030)
