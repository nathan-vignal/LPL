I'M NOT SURE THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED IT BUT HOPEFULLY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01688-A-0013)
AS FAR AS LONG TERM PEACE I DON'T THINK SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE EVER GOING TO SEE IT OUR LIFETIMES IN THE MIDDLE EAST  (fe_03_01688-A-0014)
MHM  (fe_03_01688-A-0015)

THAT'S YOU KNOW THEY JUST [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW WHY EXACTLY BUT I MEAN I HAVE MY IDEAS BUT THEY THEY JUST WILL NOT TOLERATE THAT LITTLE COUNTRY THERE SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE THERE THERE CAN'T BE PEACE AMONG THEM  (fe_03_01688-A-0017)
[SIGH] YEAH I DON'T KNOW EITHER BUT I THINK IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY'VE QUITE MOPPED UP YOU KNOW THE WAR TOTALLY BUT ONCE THEY DO I I CAN SEE WHERE WE HAVE TO BE INVOLVED SOMEWHAT OR HUSSEIN OR SOMEBODY ELSE IS GOING TO POP RIGHT UP  (fe_03_01688-A-0018)
AND I KNOW THAT THE UH IRAQIS DON'T WANT TO SAY WELL THEY DON'T THEY JUST DON'T LIKE US [LAUGHTER] EVEN IF WE'VE HELPED THEM  (fe_03_01688-A-0019)
YOU KNOW THEY THINK THEY THINK OF US AS THE GREAT SATAN AND ALL AND AH  (fe_03_01688-A-0020)
I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS AS THOUGH UM  (fe_03_01688-A-0021)

RIGHT  (fe_03_01688-A-0025)
MHM  (fe_03_01688-A-0026)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01688-A-0027)
I THINK SO FOR FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS PARTLY 'CAUSE THE IRAQIS MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT THAT BETTER BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER ARAB NATIONS IN THE U._N.  (fe_03_01688-A-0028)
AND ALSO BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_01688-A-0029)
IT WON'T BE JUST THE U._S. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE AN UGLY FACE FOR US AND UM I THINK UNTIL  (fe_03_01688-A-0030)
SOME OTHER COUNTRIES ARE INVOLVED THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO FEEL LIKE IT'S THIS IMPERIALISTIC MOVE BY THE U._S.  (fe_03_01688-A-0031)
I WISH WE COULD SOMEHOW I I DON'T KNOW TO GET THIS THROUGH TO THEM  (fe_03_01688-A-0032)
I- I THINK THEY THINK THAT WE WANT IRAQ AND WE DON'T WANT IRAQ [LAUGHTER] WE JUST DON'T WANT IRAQ KILLING PEOPLE  (fe_03_01688-A-0033)
I HONESTLY THINK THAT THEY THEY FEEL LIKE WE WANT TO CONQUER AND HAVE THEM AS LIKE ANOTHER STATE I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING WORSE  (fe_03_01688-A-0034)
NO AND I I GUESS UM THEY THEY JUST DON'T TRUST US I THINK THEY HEAR SO MUCH PROPAGANDA THAT THEY THEY JUST DON'T TRUST AMERICANS  (fe_03_01688-A-0035)
MHM  (fe_03_01688-A-0036)
YEAH YEAH I [SIGH] THEY NEED SOME SORT OF DEMOCRACY AND THEY ARE NOT TRAINED FOR THAT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'LL MANAGE  (fe_03_01688-A-0037)
THEY'RE USED TO DOING EVERYTHING BY THE BULLY METHOD [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01688-A-0038)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01688-A-0039)
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF BUT MAYBE THE OTHER ARAB NATIONS COULD HAVE SOME INPUT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR MINDSET IN A WAY THAT WE CANNOT  (fe_03_01688-A-0040)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01688-A-0041)
AND YOU KNOW AND ANOTHER ISLAMIC NATION THAT TOO THEY NEED TO HEAR FROM UM  (fe_03_01688-A-0042)
I I I THINK THEY JUST CANNOT HEAR US BECA- I MEAN BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BUT THEY REALLY HONESTLY CANNOT HEAR US  (fe_03_01688-A-0043)
SO [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01688-A-0044)

Y- YOU'RE RIGHT THOUGH IF THEY CAN FIND HUSSEIN AND HIS SONS AND WHOEVER THE HIS TOP LEADERS ARE  (fe_03_01688-A-0053)
THEY'LL WRAP IT UP REAL FAST  (fe_03_01688-A-0054)

OH AND SO IT WAS JUST RETRIBUTION  (fe_03_01688-A-0060)
THAT DOES SOUND LIKE AN URBAN LEGEND I'M AFRAID [LAUGHTER] IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED THOUGH  (fe_03_01688-A-0061)
YEAH I DIDN'T 'CAUSE UM I GET SO TIRED OF IT AND MY HUSBAND WAS AWAY FISHING BUT HE'S BACK NOW SO I'M SURE I'LL GET ALL CAUGHT UP [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01688-A-0063)

REAL THING IS ALL DONE THE REAL FIGHTING  (fe_03_01688-A-0067)
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER  (fe_03_01688-A-0069)

I TEND TO THINK THAT GORE FRANKLY IS KIND OF WIMPY SO I DON'T THINK [LAUGHTER] I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_01688-A-0072)
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT TO DO AND HE'D HAVE JUST FOLLOWED ADVISORS BUT UM  (fe_03_01688-A-0073)
AS FAR AS WHETHER I IT DID SEEM LIKE BUSH JUST THIS WAS JUST HE WAS ITCHING TO DO THIS  (fe_03_01688-A-0074)
YEAH AND I'M AND I'M BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT HE WASN'T RIGHT [NOISE] YOU KNOW I I MEAN HE HE KNOWS MORE INFORMATION THAN WE DO AND I THINK HE WAS JUST FEELING LIKE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND NOW IS THE BEST TIME  (fe_03_01688-A-0075)
I SO I I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS RIGHT OR WRONG BUT I I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS AN EVIL CHOICE ANYTHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01688-A-0076)
[NOISE] MHM  (fe_03_01688-A-0077)

NO THEY DON'T RESPOND [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_01688-A-0082)
YEAH  (fe_03_01688-A-0083)
YEAH AND I THINK THAT THEY HONESTLY THOUGHT WE WOULD NOT DO IT  (fe_03_01688-A-0084)
AND AND SO WE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE ADVANTAGE ON THAT YOU KNOW THEY JUST HE WOULD TALK ABOUT HAVING THESE HUGE MASSIVE FORCES WELL WHERE ARE THEY YOU KNOW AND UM I THINK HE JUST FIGURED IF HE  (fe_03_01688-A-0085)
COULD CONVINCE US THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY FIGHT US AND IF HE COULD CONVINCE HIS OWN PEOPLE THAT THEY COU- THEY WOULD WIN AND WE WOULD NEVER WIN  (fe_03_01688-A-0086)
THAT'S ALL HE NEEDED TO DO REALLY AND THEN ONCE THE WAR STARTED HE COULDN'T HIDE BEHIND THAT ANY MORE HIS HIS REPUTATION IS SHOT  (fe_03_01688-A-0087)
IN THAT COUNTRY BECAUSE THOSE WHO HATED HIM ARE NOW NOT AFRAID TO SAY SO  (fe_03_01688-A-0088)
AND THOSE WHO ARE KIND OF ON THE FENCE  (fe_03_01688-A-0089)
NOW S- THEY HAVE TO SEE THAT HE WAS LYING AND SAYING YOU KNOW OH WE COULD TAKE THE U._S. AND ALL THAT  (fe_03_01688-A-0090)
A- AND HE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO SEE THAT THE PEOPLE SEE THAT THE AMERICANS COMING OVER THERE AREN'T HARMING THEM THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01688-A-0091)
THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO BRING IN THIS LOOSE MORALS OR WHATEVER THEY THOUGHT AND  (fe_03_01688-A-0092)
NONE OF THAT'S HAPPENING  (fe_03_01688-A-0093)
SO HIS WORD IS  (fe_03_01688-A-0094)
PRETTY MUCH WORTHLESS AND I I THINK THEY MAYBE ACTUALLY KNOW THAT NOW  (fe_03_01688-A-0095)
MHM  (fe_03_01688-A-0096)
THAT'S TRUE YOU CAN HAVE A BENIGN DICTATORSHIP  (fe_03_01688-A-0097)
HE'S NOT BENIGN THOUGH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01688-A-0098)
BUT I'M I'M AFRAID THEY'RE SO USED TO THIS THAT THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WITH A LOT OF MONEY AND A VERY PERSUASIVE PERSONALITY  (fe_03_01688-A-0099)
COULD LEAD THEM  (fe_03_01688-A-0100)

SADDAM HUSSEIN IN MY EYES HE'S A LOT LIKE HITLER WAS BACK DURING IN WORLD WAR TWO  (fe_03_01688-B-0006)
KILLING HIS OWN PEOPLE AND CAUSING JUST PAIN AND SUFFERING  (fe_03_01688-B-0007)
AND THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MOST PART SUPPORTED THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN WORLD WAR TWO AND NOW THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WAR IN IRAQ BUT IT'S THE SAME SORT OF SITUATION  (fe_03_01688-B-0008)
YES HOPEFULLY  (fe_03_01688-B-0009)
I DON'T THINK SO EITHER EVEN IF SADDAM IS PUT OUT OF POWER  (fe_03_01688-B-0010)
THEY'RE THIS WHOLE GENERATION OF IRAQIS HAS BEEN RAISED IN A DICTATORSHIP AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REVERT TO DEMOCRACY  (fe_03_01688-B-0011)
MHM YEAH AND AND I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO END UP WORKING OUT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG UH THE UNITED STATES SHOULD TAKE INVOLVEMENT IN THAT  (fe_03_01688-B-0012)

AT WORLD PROBLEMS AND THE COUNTRIES WERE TO UNITE AND SOLVE IT AND UNITED STATES HAS GONE OVER THE U._N. BOUNDARIES IN WHAT THEY'VE DONE SO FAR SO IF THE U._N. IS FINALLY TO COOPERATE  (fe_03_01688-B-0017)
THEN WE SHOULD DEFINITELY HAND IT OVER TO THEM  (fe_03_01688-B-0018)
WE JUST WANT PEACE OVER THERE  (fe_03_01688-B-0020)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01688-B-0021)

WELL I GUESS I WOULDN'T REALLY BLAME THEM I MEAN IT HAS BEEN A LONG HAUL FOR THEM AGAINST US AND T-  (fe_03_01688-B-0023)
I DON'T SEE HOW LIBERATING THEM FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN IS REALLY GOING TO CHANGE THAT AT ALL [NOISE]  (fe_03_01688-B-0024)
MHM BUT I THINK THAT EVEN  (fe_03_01688-B-0025)
JUST HAVING SOMEONE THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEY MIGHT  (fe_03_01688-B-0026)
GO ALONG WITH IT LET'S SAY BUT AS SOON AS WE PULL OUT THEY'RE GOING TO SOMEHOW RESORT BACK TO WHAT THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED TO DO  (fe_03_01688-B-0027)

UNITED NATIONS  (fe_03_01688-B-0040)
HOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED BETTER OR HOW IT COULD OF OR IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT UNDER GORE OR AN- ANY OF THESE OTHER DECLARATIONS BY THE PEOPLE  (fe_03_01688-B-0042)
