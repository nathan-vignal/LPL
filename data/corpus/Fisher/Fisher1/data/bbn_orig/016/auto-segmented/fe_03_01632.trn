[MN] AND I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH I  (fe_03_01632-A-0007)

SEE I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THAT AND I WATCH THE NEWS BASICALLY EVERY DAY  (fe_03_01632-A-0013)
I THINK THAT A LOT OF I THINK THAT'S V- VERY HYPOCRITICAL FOR OUR NATION TO DO  (fe_03_01632-A-0014)
SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S SO MONEY COUNTRIES THAT WE ARE ALLIES WITH THAT DO A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS THAT IRAQ DOES AS FAR AS TORTURING THEIR OWN  (fe_03_01632-A-0015)
THEIR OWN PEOPLE I MEAN LIKE SOUTH KOREA THEY THEY TORTURE THEIR OWN PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT CHINA THEY TORTURE THEIR OWN PEOPLE BUT FOR SOME REASON WE'RE SINGL- SINGLING OUT IRAQ AND I THINK  (fe_03_01632-A-0016)
YOU CAN'T REALLY SA- YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW BAD IRAQ IS  (fe_03_01632-A-0017)
I I CAN'T HEAR WHAT YOU SAID  (fe_03_01632-A-0019)
I MEAN I DON'T I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW LIKE WE CAN SAY ANYONE IS WOR- LIKE IF SOMEONE KILLS SOMEONE AND TORTURES THEM I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN PUT MORE INTO THAT  (fe_03_01632-A-0020)

AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT HE SAID GOD CAME TO HIM AND SAID THAT THIS WAR WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO  (fe_03_01632-A-0031)
I MEAN I THINK THAT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO THOSE TERMS THEN YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WOULD BE DOING IF HE'S RULING THE COUNTRY BASED ON HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS  (fe_03_01632-A-0033)
AND THEN YOU HAVE GEORGE BUSH SAY THAT GOD CAME TO HIM AND SAID THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO  (fe_03_01632-A-0034)

LIKE I SAID LIKE I'M LIKE I  (fe_03_01632-A-0042)
BELIEVE IN LIKE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT SO I MEAN I RESPECT YOUR OPINION BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T FEEL LIKE US GOING TO IRAQ IS REALLY GOING TO SOLVE A LOT OF THEIR PROBLEMS BECAUSE I MEAN  (fe_03_01632-A-0043)
IF YOU JUST LOOK AT IT FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS  (fe_03_01632-A-0044)

[MN] IF WE'RE GIVING THEM A LOT LIKE A LOT OF STIMULUS PACKAGES I MEAN THAT'S JUST GOING TO [MN] BRING OUR DEBT  (fe_03_01632-A-0054)
EVEN FURTHER INTO THE WHOLE LIKE SINCE SINCE GEORGE BUSH HAS BEEN IN THE PRESIDENCY  (fe_03_01632-A-0055)

THAT'S TRUE I KNOW W- WE SHOULD'VE  (fe_03_01632-A-0069)
BUT I LIKE FOR ME I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S RIGHT TO SAY TO SOMEBODY WE'RE GOING TO BOMB YOUR COUNTRY AND BASICALLY KILL YOU BECAUSE WE DON'T AGREE WITH THE THINGS YOU SAY I MEAN  (fe_03_01632-A-0070)
[MN] IRAQ DIDN'T BOMB US  (fe_03_01632-A-0071)
