NO  (fe_03_01609-A-0006)
SO THE TOPIC WHAT DO YA THINK ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01609-A-0007)
WELL I WENT TO TENNESSEE NOT LONG AGO AND [LAUGHTER] THE AIRPORTS WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN WHAT THEY LOOKED FOR IT WAS WEIRD I UM  (fe_03_01609-A-0008)
WENT IN THE FIRST ONE  (fe_03_01609-A-0009)
AND I DIDN'T REALISE I HAD A BUTANE LIGHTER IN MY PURSE  (fe_03_01609-A-0010)
OKAY  (fe_03_01609-A-0011)
YEAH AND I GOT RIGHT THROUGH I MEAN THEY SEARCHED MY PURSE THEY SEARCHED ME I HAD TO TAKE MY SHOES OFF THEY FELT MY SEAT UNDER MY SOCKS EVERYTHING IN CHICAGO  (fe_03_01609-A-0012)
COMING BACK  (fe_03_01609-A-0014)
IN TENNESSEE AIRPORT  (fe_03_01609-A-0015)
ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M SURROUNDED BY  (fe_03_01609-A-0016)
LIKE SIX GUARDS MA'AM WILL YOU COME OVER HERE PLEASE YOU KNOW AND IT'S LIKE WHAT'D I DO WHAT'D I DO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01609-A-0017)
AND IT WAS A BUTANE LIGHTER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01609-A-0018)
THEY CONFISCATED IT AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01609-A-0019)
SO THEN THEY TAKE ME OVER TO THE PRIVATE AREA TO DO A SEARCH  (fe_03_01609-A-0020)
AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ME TAKE MY SHOES OFF  (fe_03_01609-A-0021)
YOU KNOW AND THEY THEY EVEN BUZZED BECAUSE THEY HAD METAL IN 'EM  (fe_03_01609-A-0022)
NOW THAT COULD'VE BEEN A KNIFE THAT COULD'VE BEEN A GUN THAT COULD'VE BEEN ANYTHING  (fe_03_01609-A-0023)
AND I WALKED RIGHT THROUGH IT NOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME  (fe_03_01609-A-0024)
MHM  (fe_03_01609-A-0025)
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE SECURITY WITH ALL THE HIJACKINGS I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THE SECURITY WAS A LITTLE LAX  (fe_03_01609-A-0026)
YEAH AND IT'S SAD  (fe_03_01609-A-0028)
IT'S REALLY SAD  (fe_03_01609-A-0029)
BUT  (fe_03_01609-A-0030)
AT LEAST I DO FEEL A LITTLE BIT SAFER  (fe_03_01609-A-0031)
BUT THEN MY GIRLFRIEND UM WASN'T EVEN THINKING AND AND SHE BOUGHT A SWORD FOR HER SON  (fe_03_01609-A-0032)
THEY GOT IT THROUGH THE AIRPORT WITH IT  (fe_03_01609-A-0033)
IN HER YEAH IN HER LUGGAGE  (fe_03_01609-A-0034)
IT WAS A SWORD INSIDE OF A CASE  (fe_03_01609-A-0035)
AND IT WAS A FANCY SWORD LIKE THAT YOU WOULD GET LIKE OVER IN INDIA OR SOMETHING YA KNOW  (fe_03_01609-A-0036)
AND WENT RIGHT THROUGH AND SHE GOT HOME AND SHE GOES  (fe_03_01609-A-0037)
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_01609-A-0038)
AND SHE SAYS THEY NEVER EVEN QUESTIONED IT  (fe_03_01609-A-0039)
MHM  (fe_03_01609-A-0040)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01609-A-0041)
WELL THE WAY THE PLANES ARE DESIGNED TODAY THEY CAN'T EVEN GET DOWN TO THE UM LUGGAGE CAN THEY  (fe_03_01609-A-0042)
FROM INSIDE THE PLANE  (fe_03_01609-A-0043)
YEAH MAYBE THAT'S WHY SHE GOT THROUGH WITH A SWORD I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01609-A-0044)
I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_01609-A-0047)
I HAVE NO CLUE  (fe_03_01609-A-0048)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01609-A-0049)
SO  (fe_03_01609-A-0050)
BUT THAT THAT WAS ABOUT MY ONLY EXPERIENCE AND  (fe_03_01609-A-0051)
AND I SIT THERE TOO AND I WONDER  (fe_03_01609-A-0052)
THAT'S JUST GETTING ON THE PLANE HOW MUCH DANGER IS THERE RIGHT IN THE AIRPORT AND I THINK MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE  (fe_03_01609-A-0053)
I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T GO  (fe_03_01609-A-0054)
TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE OFF ANY MORE LIKE WHEN I TOOK MY GRANDSON AND  (fe_03_01609-A-0055)
MY DAUGHTER THEY WERE GOING BACK TO ARIZONA AND YOU HAVE TO BE THERE AN HOUR OR TWO BEFOREHAND  (fe_03_01609-A-0056)
AND IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE DOWN THERE WITH THEM UNTIL THEY GOT ON THE PLANE AND SEEN THEM OFF AND EVERYTHING I MISS THAT  (fe_03_01609-A-0057)
MM MM YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANY MORE  (fe_03_01609-A-0058)
YEAH  (fe_03_01609-A-0060)
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN AND LIKE THE SHOPS AND ALL THAT ARE SUFFERING YOU CAN'T GET IN THERE BUT YET THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAVELLING  (fe_03_01609-A-0061)
THEY GO BACK THERE AND I DON'T  (fe_03_01609-A-0062)
WELL YEAH I GUESS YOU ARE SEARCHED BEFORE YOU GET BACK TO THAT PART  (fe_03_01609-A-0063)
BUT UM  (fe_03_01609-A-0064)
I I THINK MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE OVERBOARD IN SOME AREAS AND THEN OTHER AREAS IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE LAX  (fe_03_01609-A-0065)
YEAH  (fe_03_01609-A-0066)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01609-A-0067)
WELL DO YOU FEEL SAFE FLYING  (fe_03_01609-A-0069)
DO YOU FEEL SAFE FLYING NOW  (fe_03_01609-A-0070)
YEAH  (fe_03_01609-A-0071)
WELL WHILE YOU'RE WAITING AROUND IN THE AIRPORT I MEAN  (fe_03_01609-A-0072)
THERE'S STILL OPPORTUNITIES FOR TERRORISTS  (fe_03_01609-A-0073)
YOU KNOW IN THE AIRPORT AND I WOULD THINK WELL  (fe_03_01609-A-0074)
IF YOU REALLY HAD A TERRORIST GONNA ATTACH  (fe_03_01609-A-0075)
UM  (fe_03_01609-A-0076)
SURE SO FAR THEY'VE ALWAYS ATTACKED A PLANE BUT WHAT'S TO KEEP THEM FROM ATTACKING THE WHOLE AIRPORT  (fe_03_01609-A-0077)
YOU KNOW AND I DON'T REALLY FEEL THERE'S ENOUGH SECURITY THAT WAY  (fe_03_01609-A-0078)
UM  (fe_03_01609-A-0079)
YEAH THEY LIMIT 'EM FROM GETTING BACK TO WHERE THEY ABOARD BUT  (fe_03_01609-A-0080)
THERE'S STILL A MAJORITY OF THE AIRPORT THAT'S OPEN TO EVERYBODY  (fe_03_01609-A-0081)
I THINK MAYBE  (fe_03_01609-A-0082)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_01609-A-0083)
AND I I HAVE TO WONDER TOO HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE  (fe_03_01609-A-0084)
UM AREN'T INVOLVED  (fe_03_01609-A-0085)
THAT THESE PEOPLE THROUGH  (fe_03_01609-A-0086)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01609-A-0087)
AND HOW WELL ARE THEY CHECKED BY THEIR COWORKERS  (fe_03_01609-A-0088)
SO  (fe_03_01609-A-0089)
I THINK MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING JUST ANYBODY WHO ENTERS THE BUILDING SHOULD BE CHECKED BEFORE THEY GO  (fe_03_01609-A-0090)
IN THE BUILDING INSTEAD OF HALF WAY THROUGH THE BUILDING  (fe_03_01609-A-0091)
IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE GONNA DO IT  (fe_03_01609-A-0092)
MHM  (fe_03_01609-A-0093)

I DON'T KNOW I I FEEL IF THEY'RE GONNA DO SECURITY LET'S DO A WHOLE SECURITY THING  (fe_03_01609-A-0098)
CHECK EVERYBODY WITH A METAL DETECTOR WHEN THEY WALK IN  (fe_03_01609-A-0099)
UM  (fe_03_01609-A-0100)
AND VERY POSSIBLY HAVE THE EMPLOYEES CHECKED BY A MINIMUM OF TWO OTHER EMPLOYEES  (fe_03_01609-A-0101)
AND THEY MAY THEY MAYBE HAVE TO BE CHECKED BY ONE BUT THERE COULD BE TWO THAT ARE WORKING TOGETHER SO I REALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE RANDOMLY SELECTING TWO OTHER  (fe_03_01609-A-0102)
