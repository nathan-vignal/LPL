THEY DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01690-A-0026)
AND THEY WON'T LISTEN TO EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01690-A-0027)
AND JUST SIT DOWN AND TRY TO WORK OUT  (fe_03_01690-A-0028)
THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE WORST THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT  (fe_03_01690-A-0029)

A LITTLE WHILE BACK HOW THEY WERE ALL FIGHTING WITH THE AH OTHER PEOPLE OVER THAT AND HOW UPSET THEY WERE AND THEN I FOUND OUT SOMETHING INTERESTING  (fe_03_01690-A-0031)
UM FROM A FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A REALLY COOL HISTORY TEACHER  (fe_03_01690-A-0032)

THE PEOPLE GOT THE LEA- PALESTINIAN LEADER GOT EVERYTHING THAT HE ASKED FOR  (fe_03_01690-A-0037)
AND THEN HE TURNED IT DOWN  (fe_03_01690-A-0038)

I DON'T GET WHY THE PEOPLE WOULD REFUSE IT THEY GOT ALL THE STUFF THAT THEY WERE PROTESTING FOR  (fe_03_01690-A-0040)
LIKE BEING THEIR OWN STATE AND HAVING HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT LIKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS  (fe_03_01690-A-0041)
AND THEN THEY JUST  (fe_03_01690-A-0042)
REFUSE IT  (fe_03_01690-A-0043)
AND SUDDENLY SAY THAT THEY DON'T WANT IT  (fe_03_01690-A-0044)
UM  (fe_03_01690-A-0045)

JUST LIKE HELP THEM A LITTLE BIT WHEN THEY NEED THEM  (fe_03_01690-A-0059)
WHEN THEY NEED IT BUT DON'T TRY TO GET TOO INVOLVED AND DON'T TRY TO HELP THEM TOO MUCH BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL START RELYING ON YOU AND WHEN YOU END UP HAVING TO DRAW BACK  (fe_03_01690-A-0060)
DUE TO PROBABLY POLITICS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01690-A-0061)

GOOD  (fe_03_01690-B-0002)

[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01690-B-0004)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_01690-B-0005)

MHM  (fe_03_01690-B-0009)
UM YEAH I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MY MIND WAS THE ISRAELI PALESTINIAN CONFLICT BUT I GUESS IRAQ ALSO FALLS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS WELL IT'S UM WELL I THINK IT'S HARD I THINK UM  (fe_03_01690-B-0010)
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO  (fe_03_01690-B-0011)
REMEMBER THAT THE PEOPLE WERE UNDER A DICTATOR SO THE INFORMATION AND NEWS THAT THEY RECEIVED WAS VERY LIMITED  (fe_03_01690-B-0012)
SO I'M SURE ANYTHING THEY HEARD ABOUT THE UNITED STATES OR AMERICA WAS PROBABLY VERY NEGATIVE UM AND THEY THINK IT'S HARD TO FIGHT A WAR FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE CLAIMING THAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND FREEDOM  (fe_03_01690-B-0013)
WHEN THE PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY THE ONES ASKING FOR THAT ASSISTANCE SO  (fe_03_01690-B-0015)
IT CAN BE VERY UM PROBLEMATIC IN THAT WAY  (fe_03_01690-B-0016)
[MN] 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY A DEMOCRACY IS FOUNDED BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WANTED A DEMOCRACY BUT IN THIS CASE A DEMOCRACY WAS CREATED BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES WANTED TO CREATE IT NOT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE  (fe_03_01690-B-0017)
THEMSELVES FOUGHT FOR IT  (fe_03_01690-B-0018)
SO I THINK THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC  (fe_03_01690-B-0019)
NO THAT'S OKAY YEAH I WAS THINKING PEACE I MEAN I GUESS THE WAR'S ALMOST OVER SO I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE PEACEFUL  (fe_03_01690-B-0020)
YEAH  (fe_03_01690-B-0021)
A WAR YEAH  (fe_03_01690-B-0022)

WE OBVIOUSLY OUT GUNNED THEM AND OUT BOMBED THEM AND HAD MANY MORE MISSILES  (fe_03_01690-B-0025)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01690-B-0026)
SO UM  (fe_03_01690-B-0027)
UM WILL PEACE EVER BE OBTAINED IN THE MIDDLE EAST LIKE I SAID I DON'T KNOW I I WAS THINKING IT POSSIBLY THE QUESTION WHEN I HEARD THAT QUESTION I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WILL BE UM IT WAS REFERRING TO THE PALESTINIAN ISRAELI CONFLICT THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS REFERRING TO  (fe_03_01690-B-0028)
MHM  (fe_03_01690-B-0029)

ONE AND ONLY MODERN  (fe_03_01690-B-0031)
UM DEMOCRATIC NATION AMONGST UM YOU KNOW SOME VERY CONSERVATIVE MUSLIM NATIONS SO IT MAKES IT THE ODD BALL OUT SO  (fe_03_01690-B-0032)
AND OF COURSE A PART OF THE TENSIONS ARE THAT THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WANT THEIR OWN STATE AND THEIR OWN HOMELAND AND THEY DON'T HAVE IT MHM MHM  (fe_03_01690-B-0033)
APPARENTLY HE GOT A VERY GOOD DEAL AND HE TURNED IT DOWN THIS WAS WITH CLINTON YEAH THIS WAS A WHILE AGO  (fe_03_01690-B-0034)
I I DON'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS SHARON OR BARAK BUT YEAH BECAUSE UM YEAH [LIPSMACK] APPARENTLY HE GOT A VERY GOOD DEAL AND UM  (fe_03_01690-B-0035)
HE TURNED IT DOWN BECAUSE HE KNEW THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT SUPPORT IT AND HE KNEW HE'D PROBABLY BE ASSASSINATED I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON  (fe_03_01690-B-0036)
UM  (fe_03_01690-B-0037)
[LIPSMACK] YEAH I'M NOT REALLY SURE OF THE POLITICS BEHIND IT BUT MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT UM UM  (fe_03_01690-B-0039)
I'M I'M NOT SURE BUT I I THINK MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT TO  (fe_03_01690-B-0040)
DEAL WITH  (fe_03_01690-B-0041)
CLINTON  (fe_03_01690-B-0042)

SOME KIND OF FACILITY BUT  (fe_03_01690-B-0048)
JAPANESE AMERICANS HAVE WHAT  (fe_03_01690-B-0050)
