I'M FROM UM ELLINGTON CONNECTICUT  (fe_03_01662-B-0004)
OKAY WHAT SHE BASICALLY SAID WAS  (fe_03_01662-B-0006)
UM HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST DO YOU THINK THAT PEACE WILL EVER BE OBTAINED DO YOU THINK THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD STAY INVOLVED [NOISE] THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT SHE [NOISE]  (fe_03_01662-B-0007)
YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] GIVE OR TAKE AH LITTLE BITS THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT SHE SAID  (fe_03_01662-B-0008)
SURE [LAUGHTER] UM YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T THINK PEACE WILL EVER BE ATTAINED  (fe_03_01662-B-0009)
I I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REAL NEGATIVE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THE UM  (fe_03_01662-B-0010)
[NOISE] THAT THERE'S ANY WAY THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THAT AREA IS GOING TO BE SATISFIED AND WITHOUT THEM BEING SATISFIED I DON'T THINK THERE WILL EVER BE A TRUE PEACE  (fe_03_01662-B-0011)
I THINK THERE MIGHT COME A TIME WHEN  (fe_03_01662-B-0012)
THE REINS [NOISE] ARE TIGHTER AND YOU KEEP THINGS UNDER CONTROL BETTER BUT I DON'T REALLY EVER THINK THERE WILL A TRUE PEACE AS LIKE WHAT WE KNOW IN THE UNITED STATES HERE WHERE YOU CAN  (fe_03_01662-B-0013)

THAT WE CAN DO THAT'S GOING TO HELP THE SITUATION OVER THERE I THINK  (fe_03_01662-B-0017)
THAT  (fe_03_01662-B-0018)
WE MIGHT HAVE TO STAY INVOLVED BECAUSE WE MIGHT HAVE TO PROTECT OUR OWN INTERESTS  (fe_03_01662-B-0019)
UM AT CERTAIN TIMES ESPECIALLY LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER A TERRORIST THERE OR YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING THAT WILL  (fe_03_01662-B-0020)
PREVENT [NOISE] ATTACKS  (fe_03_01662-B-0021)
ON THE UNITED STATES BUT I ALSO THINK THAT  (fe_03_01662-B-0022)
THE MORE OUR PRESENCE IN THE AREA  (fe_03_01662-B-0023)
IS A LARGE ONE THE MORE IT SEEMS TO STIR UP  (fe_03_01662-B-0024)
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO CALM ANYBODY DOWN SO  (fe_03_01662-B-0025)
YEAH AND DOWN THE ROAD WE'RE GOING TO PAY ANOTHER PRICE FOR THIS  (fe_03_01662-B-0026)

BEING BROUGHT UNDER A BANNER OF A- YOU KNOW ANY OTHER ANYBODY ELSE ANYWHERE  (fe_03_01662-B-0038)

USUALLY ARE NOT THE INTERESTS OF EITHER SIDE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN OUR INTERESTS ARE IN ADDITION TO EVERYBODY ELSE'S INTERESTS SO YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW LIKE  (fe_03_01662-B-0049)
THE PALESTINIANS' INTERESTS THE ISRAELIS' INTERESTS AND THEN OUR INTERESTS AND I DON'T THINK ANY THREE OF THEM A- ANY YOU KNOW TWO OF THE THREE ARE THE SAME THING  (fe_03_01662-B-0050)

YOU KNOW I I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'VE GOT TO STAY INVOLVED IN IRAQ I MEAN Y- WE'RE IN THERE WE YOU KNOW UPROOTED THE WHOLE COUNTRY AT THAT P- THIS POINT WE CAN'T  (fe_03_01662-B-0052)
WITHDRAW AND LEAVE A MESS SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE  (fe_03_01662-B-0053)
RIGHT SO I THINK AT THIS POINT WE OWE IT TO THE PEOPLE  (fe_03_01662-B-0056)
IF WE'VE TOPPLED ONE GOVERNMENT WE OWE IT TO THEM TO STAY THERE UNTIL THERE IS  (fe_03_01662-B-0057)
AT LEAST SOME HOPES OF ANOTHER STABLE GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_01662-B-0058)
SO I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL OUT FROM THAT BUT  (fe_03_01662-B-0059)

BE GAINING  (fe_03_01662-B-0069)
HUH WELL I I KINDA HOPE NOT 'CAUSE I THINK IF ANYTHING'S GOING TO RADICALIZE THE POPULATION [LAUGHTER] SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA PROVE TO THEM WHAT THEY'VE BEEN AFRAID OF ALL ALONG AND THAT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE REGION  (fe_03_01662-B-0070)
AND DICTATE TO 'EM AND I THINK  (fe_03_01662-B-0071)
THAT IT'S IN OUR BEST INTEREST AT THIS POINT TO PROVE TO THEM THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO BUT  (fe_03_01662-B-0072)
I DON'T KNOW [LAUGHTER] NOBODY LISTENS TO [LAUGHTER] PEOPLE AT OUR LEVEL ANYWAY RIGHT  (fe_03_01662-B-0073)
SO I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE EVEN IF YOU  (fe_03_01662-B-0074)
EVEN IF YOU HAD THE POWER TO MAKE ANYTHING AT ALL  (fe_03_01662-B-0075)
OCCUR  (fe_03_01662-B-0076)
IN THAT AREA THAT YOU WANTED TO OCCUR YOU KNOW LIKE YOU JUST YOU KNOW OVERNIGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN  (fe_03_01662-B-0077)
I'M NOT EVEN SURE THEN I WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL YOU  (fe_03_01662-B-0078)
A GOOD PLAN YOU KNOW WHAT  (fe_03_01662-B-0079)

YEAH BUT I I DON'T KNOW YO- YOU KIND OF WONDER  (fe_03_01662-B-0085)
I SUPPOSE THERE ARE SOME REAL RADICAL OPINIONS BUT EVEN THEN  (fe_03_01662-B-0086)
I MEAN LIKE I  (fe_03_01662-B-0087)
HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY SAY LIKE BE AGAINST THE WAR  (fe_03_01662-B-0088)
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE AGAINST THE WAR THAT HAD ANOTHER PLAN  (fe_03_01662-B-0089)
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SO HOW  (fe_03_01662-B-0090)
HOW DO YOU AC- ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVES WELL IT'S ONE THING TO BE AGAINST SOMETHING BUT I THINK THAT YOU ALSO THEN SHOULD HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE UM  (fe_03_01662-B-0091)
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW JUST GOING ON THE SAME PATH WAS AN ALTERNATIVE AND I MEAN I DON'T I GUESS  (fe_03_01662-B-0092)
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN  (fe_03_01662-B-0093)
ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS WORKING  (fe_03_01662-B-0094)
BUT ANYWAY  (fe_03_01662-B-0095)
YEAH I'M NOT SURE  (fe_03_01662-B-0096)
YEAH WE DON'T WE DON'T  (fe_03_01662-B-0097)

AND SO WE DON'T  (fe_03_01662-B-0100)
WE GET MOST OF OUR INFORMATION EITHER FROM MAGAZINES OR FROM NEWSPAPERS OR EITHER THAT OR FROM THE RADIO SO  (fe_03_01662-B-0101)
IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE BEEN HAVING CONSTANT EXPOSURE TO WHAT'S GOING ON EITHER  (fe_03_01662-B-0102)
BUT THE PAPERS TODAY SAID THAT THEY HAD FOUND CHEMICAL OR THE THE PRECURSORS OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN IRAQ  (fe_03_01662-B-0103)
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_01662-B-0104)
GOING IN THERE ANYW-  (fe_03_01662-B-0105)
