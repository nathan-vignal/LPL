AND I COM- I AGREE COMPLETELY THAT THE U._S. SHOULD BE OVER THERE HELPING THEM  (fe_03_01652-A-0012)
I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS  (fe_03_01652-A-0013)
BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIVED IN THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT SINCE JESUS'S TIME  (fe_03_01652-A-0016)

YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE TO MAINTAIN OUR OUR INVOLVEMENT IN A  (fe_03_01652-B-0011)
WAY THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO TO BOTH THE  (fe_03_01652-B-0013)
MIDDLE EAST AND THE REST OF THE WORLD BUT  (fe_03_01652-B-0014)
UM BUT AH IT IT PERHAPS CAN BE DONE I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE SEEING HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS FIRST STEP OF IRAQ AND GETTING A  (fe_03_01652-B-0015)
A STABLE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED SO  (fe_03_01652-B-0016)
YEP WELL I I YES I MEAN I THINK THE THE AH  (fe_03_01652-B-0017)
UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0018)
DEMOCRATIC RULE UM IS A LITTLE BIT AH  (fe_03_01652-B-0019)
AH UNUSUAL FOR  (fe_03_01652-B-0020)
FOR THAT PART OF THE WORLD  (fe_03_01652-B-0021)
I'M SURE IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW  (fe_03_01652-B-0022)
IF IT CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND AND ONCE IT IS ESTABLISHED IF IT CAN BE MAINTAINED  (fe_03_01652-B-0023)
SO  (fe_03_01652-B-0025)
MHM WELL IT'S A DIFFICULT A DIFFICULT QUESTION THE THE  (fe_03_01652-B-0026)
THE RELATIVE EASE OF WHICH IT WAS DONE THIS TIME AH WAS PROBABLY  (fe_03_01652-B-0027)
DUE IN A LARGE PART TO THE FACT THAT THAT WE HAVE HAD  (fe_03_01652-B-0028)
AH A NUMBER OF YEARS OF  (fe_03_01652-B-0029)
OF TIME TO IMPROVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND TO AH TO  (fe_03_01652-B-0030)
BE ABLE TO PRECISION BOMB  (fe_03_01652-B-0031)
AND SO FORTH AND SO HAD IT BEEN  (fe_03_01652-B-0032)
HAD IT BEEN DONE IN THE FIRST GULF WAR THAT WOULD HAVE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN  (fe_03_01652-B-0033)

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER  (fe_03_01652-B-0035)
NO I I DON'T THINK THEY WILL BECAUSE AH I MEAN FOR THERE TO BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE MIDDLE EAST UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0038)
THERE HAS TO BE PEACE WITH ISRAEL AND THERE WON'T WON'T BE PEACE WITH ISRAEL AH  (fe_03_01652-B-0039)
AH UNTIL THE LORD COMES SO  (fe_03_01652-B-0041)
[LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] SO  (fe_03_01652-B-0042)
THAT'S A CHALLENGE THAT THAT WON'T BE MET UNTIL THEN  (fe_03_01652-B-0044)
YEAH I I I AGREE BUT BUT  (fe_03_01652-B-0045)
UM PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE ARE PRETTY ADAPTABLE AND AND AH SO THERE WILL BE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF SORTING OUT BUT FORTUNATELY IN IN IRAQ THERE'S THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0046)
BASIC INTERNAL STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF ROADS AND  (fe_03_01652-B-0047)
UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0048)
YOU KNOW UTILITIES AND AND THAT TYPE OF THING SO UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0049)
CERTAINLY A LONG WAY TO GO BUT AH  (fe_03_01652-B-0051)

THAT IT WON'T TAKE AS LONG AS AS IT MIGHT IN ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT  (fe_03_01652-B-0053)
UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0054)

I DON'T KNOW IT'S AN INTERESTING AH  (fe_03_01652-B-0057)
IT'S AN INTERESTING THOUGHT UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0058)
I THINK THE I THINK ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT DEMOCRACY UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0059)
AH WORKS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A CAPITALISTIC MENTALITY OF OF TRYING TO BUILD AND AND AH IMPROVE  (fe_03_01652-B-0060)
IMPROVE AH  (fe_03_01652-B-0062)
OVERALL LIFE AND AND TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO  (fe_03_01652-B-0063)
IN THAT STRUCTURE AH YOU KNOW FOREIGN COMPANIES CREATE JOBS AND AND YOU KNOW REALLY REALLY GO ABOUT TRYING TO  (fe_03_01652-B-0064)
TO  (fe_03_01652-B-0065)
CREATE AN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND I THINK THAT SITUATION IS PROBABLY FURTHER UM FURTHER ALONG THAN PERHAPS SOME AREAS OF AFRICA AND UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0066)
BUT AH  (fe_03_01652-B-0067)

UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0072)
UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0073)
YOU KNOW THAT THAT IF THAT'S CONTAINED AND A STRUCTURE IS BROUGHT IN  (fe_03_01652-B-0074)
I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE IN IN WHO  (fe_03_01652-B-0075)
GETS THE NOD AS THE AS THE LEADER OF CHOICE AH TO SET UP A NEW GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE TH- TH- THERE ARE VERY DIFFERING  (fe_03_01652-B-0076)
AH RELIGIOUS SECTS AND AND ALL AH THAT ARE THERE LIKE IT AH  (fe_03_01652-B-0077)
UM EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TO PUT IN A KIND OF A OF A UNITED GOVERNMENT TOGETHER I THINK  (fe_03_01652-B-0078)
REALLY GO AHEAD  (fe_03_01652-B-0080)
UM  (fe_03_01652-B-0081)
