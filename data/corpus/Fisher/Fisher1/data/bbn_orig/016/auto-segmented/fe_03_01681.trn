AND I MEAN THEY CLAIM THEY'RE FREEING THE IRAQ PEOPLE BUT THEY MAKE ALL THESE ACCUSATIONS AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LOT OF THEM ARE UNFOUNDED LIKE THEY TALK ABOUT THE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND THEY'VE NEVER FOUND THEM IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS TO GO IN  (fe_03_01681-A-0016)

HOW MUCH THE IRAQI PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO SETTLE THEIR OWN ISSUES AND THEN IT DEPENDS ON IF THEY TRY TO FIGHT SERIOUS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH SYRIA PROBLEMS WITH ISRAEL  (fe_03_01681-A-0026)
