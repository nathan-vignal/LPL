AND MY NAME IS BRIDGET TAYLOR AND I'M FROM CHICAGO ILLINOIS  (fe_03_01215-A-0002)
UM I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DECIDE IF THERE'S A SERIOUS OH I DON'T KNOW WELL I'M IN THE CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_01215-A-0003)
AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING AS A SERIOUS PROBLEM  (fe_03_01215-A-0004)
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN TEXAS  (fe_03_01215-A-0005)
THE ONLY I GUESS THE ONLY ONE THING ISSUE TO ME ONE CONCERN IS  (fe_03_01215-A-0006)
WHEN THE STUDENTS ARE IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP FOR SCHOOL  (fe_03_01215-A-0007)
THE PARENTS PROBABLY SHOULD BE CONTACTED THAT YOUR CHILD IS NOT IN SCHOOL TODAY  (fe_03_01215-A-0008)
'CAUSE THE YOU KNOW THE PARENT COULD HAVE SENT THE CHILD TO SCHOOL AND MAYBE THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP  (fe_03_01215-A-0009)
AND THEN SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN NEAR THE END OF SCHOOL WHEN YOU GO TO PICK 'EM UP OR EXPECT 'EM TO BE AT HOME AND YOU KNOW DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE ALL THAT WHOLE DAY HAS GONE BY  (fe_03_01215-A-0010)
WHEN SOMETHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED SO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF PLAN FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE A LOT BETTER YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01215-A-0011)
[COUGH] 'CAUSE MY SON GOES TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY BUT ONE DAY HE SHOULD NOT BE IN SCHOOL THEN I'D KNOW SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG THEY SHOULDN'T JUST ASSUME HE'S SICK AND WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM TOMORROW  (fe_03_01215-A-0012)
EXACTLY 'CAUSE YOU KNOW HE GETS ON THE SCHOOL BUS SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS AN ATTENDANT THERE SOMETIMES I CAN'T STAY THERE AND WAIT FOR HIM TO GET ON THE SCHOOL BUS  (fe_03_01215-A-0013)
FROM THERE THE SCHOOL BUS I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN  (fe_03_01215-A-0014)
MHM THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0015)
OKAY  (fe_03_01215-A-0016)
MHM  (fe_03_01215-A-0017)
RIGHT WELL YEAH SOME OF 'EM DO  (fe_03_01215-A-0018)
SOME DO BUT RIGHT NOT ALL OF THEM DO  (fe_03_01215-A-0019)
AND I DON'T YEAH I MEAN THEY COULD AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE KIDS MIGHT FEEL LIKE  (fe_03_01215-A-0020)
FEELING LIKE CRIMINALS GOING TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY  (fe_03_01215-A-0021)
AND UM BUT IT COULD BE LIKE AT THE AIRPORT IT COULD BE A  (fe_03_01215-A-0022)
UM THAT'S A GOOD POINT 'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOUR FELLOW [MN]  (fe_03_01215-A-0023)
CLASSMATE COULD BE BRINGING TO THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_01215-A-0024)
YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT BE MAD AT SOMEBODY AND IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE CHILDREN AND NOT JUST SOMEBODY ELSE COMING IN THE BUILDING BUT THAT IS SO TRUE AND SO MANY PEOPLE DO COME IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL FOR WHATEVER REASON  (fe_03_01215-A-0025)
YOU KNOW IF THEY DO WANT TO GO TO THE OFFICE JUST THE FACT THAT THEY MADE IT INTO THE SCHOOL YOU'RE RIGHT THEY COULD HAVE ANYTHING AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY MAY DO  (fe_03_01215-A-0026)
MHM  (fe_03_01215-A-0028)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0029)
RIGHT 'CAUSE EACH SCHOOL IS DIFFERENT AND THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE WHEN I WAS WORKING THE POLLS SOME OF THE POLLS WERE IN SCHOOLS AND I WAS DOING A VOTE SO I HAD TO GO IN AND DELIVER THE VOTES TO THE POLLING PLACES  (fe_03_01215-A-0030)
I KNOW ONE SCHOOL THERE WAS SOME LITTLE KIDS BEFORE SCHOOL STARTED WAITING ON THE INSIDE I JUST WALKED IN THERE WAS NO ADULT THERE WHATSOEVER I WALKED THROUGH HALLWAYS LOOKING TO FIND WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO DELIVER THE POLLS  (fe_03_01215-A-0031)
AND THEN WHEN I WENT BACK THE SECOND TIME AND HAD TO GO AGAIN THEN IT'S A CHILD TELLING ME WHERE TO GO I'M LIKE WHERE ARE  (fe_03_01215-A-0032)
YOU KNOW THE TEACHERS  (fe_03_01215-A-0033)
THERE WERE NOT EVEN ANY TEACHERS IN THE HALLWAY THERE WAS AND THEN WHEN THEY SAW ME LOOKING YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THEY WEREN'T SAYING ANYTHING LIKE CAN I HELP YOU OR ARE YOU LOST OR WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO THIS CHILD  (fe_03_01215-A-0034)
[LAUGHTER] I WAS LIKE I COULD HAVE SNATCHED THOSE KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL AND NOBODY WOULD EVEN KNOW  (fe_03_01215-A-0035)
I WAS PRETTY SCARED  (fe_03_01215-A-0036)
[MN] MHM MOST SCHOOLS ARE BETTER THAN THAT BUT THAT ONE WAS PRETTY BAD  (fe_03_01215-A-0037)
'CAUSE I KNOW MY SON'S SCHOOL THEIR SECURITY SITS RIGHT UP THEY ONLY HAVE DOOR OPEN AND THAT'S NOT EVEN OPEN YOU HAVE TO BE BUZZED IN  (fe_03_01215-A-0038)
SO AT LEAST YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A CAMERA AND THEY KNOW WHO'S COMING IN AND THE SECURITY SITS RIGHT THERE  (fe_03_01215-A-0039)
SO WHEN YOU COME IN HE SEES WHO'S COMING IN SO THEY DO HAVE THAT  (fe_03_01215-A-0040)
BUT IT LIKE I SAY EACH SCHOOL IS DIFFERENT BUT THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL IS YOU KNOW I COULD WALK IN THERE WASN'T NO LOCK AND KIDS WERE WALKING AROUND AND I COULD SNATCH ANYBODY I WANTED TO OR GO ANYWHERE I WANTED NOBODY I COULD HAVE YOU KNOW [MN] UM  (fe_03_01215-A-0041)
HUNG OUT IN THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY CLOSED AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY KNOWN  (fe_03_01215-A-0042)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01215-A-0043)
MHM  (fe_03_01215-A-0044)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0045)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0046)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0047)
RIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER PROBLEM IS I I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS THERE BUT I KNOW IN CHICAGO THERE'S NO MORNING DROP OFF YOU KNOW PARENTS HAVE TO BE TO WORK BEFORE NINE THIRTY  (fe_03_01215-A-0048)
AND SO WE REALLY CAN'T BRING OUR KIDS 'CAUSE MY SON'S SCHOOL STARTS AT NINE FIFTEEN WE CAN'T THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GET THERE BEFORE NINE OCLOCK  (fe_03_01215-A-0049)
RIGHT AND SO WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO NOW I DON'T WORK RIGHT NOW BUT IF I WERE TO GET A JOB WHERE I HAD TO BE THERE AT EIGHT THIRTY WHAT COULD I DO THEN I WOULD HAVE TO TRY TO DEPEND ON SOMEBODY ELSE GETTING HIM TO THE BUS STOP AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT  (fe_03_01215-A-0050)
SO THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN START RUNNING INTO A LOT OF DIFFERENT OTHER PROBLEMS NOW IT'S OKAY 'CAUSE WHEN HE GETS DROPPED OFF HE GOES TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AROUND MY HOUSE BUT IN THE MORNING THERE'S NOWHERE FOR HIM AND THE SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING FOR BEFORE AND AFTER  (fe_03_01215-A-0051)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01215-A-0052)
AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF HALF DAYS THEY HAVE ONE ONE A MONTH AT LEAST AND MAYBE TWO A MONTH WHAT ARE THE PARENTS TO DO ON THOSE DAYS WHEN THEY GET OUT AT TWO UH NOON  (fe_03_01215-A-0053)
WE CAN'T KEEP TAKING OFF OF WORK EVERYBODY DOESN'T HAVE RELATIVES OR BABYSITTERS  (fe_03_01215-A-0054)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0055)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0056)
EXACTLY AND IT'S LIKE THEY JUST THREW THIS PLAN ON US AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR LAST YEAR WE IT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW I MEAN THEY HAD HALF DAYS BUT NOW THEY HAVE 'EM ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK  (fe_03_01215-A-0057)
AND [COUGH] IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME EVERY TIME YOU TURN AROUND THEY'RE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR WHATEVER REASON SO IT'S LIKE MY GOODNESS I GOTTA KEEP TRYING TO FIND SOMEBODY TO WATCH HIM OR BE HERE OR IT CUTS INTO MY WORK DAY YOU KNOW IT CUTS INTO MY DAY  (fe_03_01215-A-0058)
BUT I NEED TO BE PROVIDING FOR THE HOUSE OR WHATEVER I'M A SINGLE PARENT  (fe_03_01215-A-0059)
SO IT'S REALLY THE SCHOOL SITUATION IS GETTING WORSE AS FAR AS THAT'S CONCERNED  (fe_03_01215-A-0060)
AND UM  (fe_03_01215-A-0061)
THEY DON'T TAKE IT INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE NEED UH ADVANCE NOTICE  (fe_03_01215-A-0062)
[COUGH] THEY JUST GIVE US A SCHEDULE THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN  (fe_03_01215-A-0063)
AND IT'S LIKE OH MY GOSH  (fe_03_01215-A-0064)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01215-A-0065)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0066)
AND THEN OUR PARK DISTRICTS YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WORK ALL THE WAY WITH THE SCHOOLS WHEN THEY'RE OUT THEY UH HAVE THEY STOP TWO WEEKS BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS  (fe_03_01215-A-0067)
AND THEY WON'T START UNTIL TWO WEEKS AFTER SCHOOL GETS OUT SO YOU HAVE TWO WEEKS OR A WEEK OF WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR CHILD  (fe_03_01215-A-0068)
AND YOU KNOW SO THOSE KIND OF THINGS ARE REALLY REALLY HARD BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KEEP THE KIDS OFF THE STREET BUT DURING THE TIME THAT THEY ARE OUT OF SCHOOL THEY DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF PROGRAM FOR THEM TO KEEP THEM OFF THE STREETS  (fe_03_01215-A-0069)
MHM  (fe_03_01215-A-0070)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01215-A-0071)
'CAUSE MAYBE YOU KNOW THEY CAN HIRE PEOPLE TO  (fe_03_01215-A-0072)
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MORNING PROGRAM TO  (fe_03_01215-A-0073)
YOU KNOW WATCH THE KIDS MAYBE A HALF HOUR OR HOUR BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS  (fe_03_01215-A-0074)
BECAUSE UM LIKE THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND CATHOLIC SCHOOLS THEY PRETTY MUCH HAVE THAT AND I KNOW THEY HAVE THAT AND STILL HOW THEY PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES SO THEY NEED MORE MONEY PUT INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS I THINK THE TEACHERS NEED TO GET PAID MORE  (fe_03_01215-A-0075)
THAT'S THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM NOW THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA BE EDUCATING OUR FUTURE DOCTORS OR FUTURE PRESIDENTS OR FUTURE EVERYTHING THEN THAT MONEY NEEDS TO GO ONTO THE PEOPLE WHO'S GONNA BE EDUCATING THEM  (fe_03_01215-A-0076)
AND THEIR YOUR BASIC EDUCATION IS WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG  (fe_03_01215-A-0077)
TEACHERS NEED TO BE PAID A LOT MORE MONEY THEY GO TO SCHOOL FOUR YEARS JUST LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY GET MINIMUM PAY  (fe_03_01215-A-0078)
GET PAID MORE EXACTLY  (fe_03_01215-A-0079)
