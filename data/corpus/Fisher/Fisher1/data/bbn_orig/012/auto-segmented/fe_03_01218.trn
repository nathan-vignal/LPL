YEAH WELL BASICALLY I UM WO- WORKED IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR TEN YEARS  (fe_03_01218-B-0005)
SO UM BASICALLY I FEEL THAT THE PROBLEM WITH UM PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS THAT  (fe_03_01218-B-0006)
THE ADMINISTRATION THEY SET OUR CHILDREN UP FOR FAILURE THEY SET THE STUDENTS UP FOR FAILURE ESPECIALLY WITH THE S._O._L.S BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO START 'EM OFF AT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU KNOW WITH MATH AND  (fe_03_01218-B-0007)
UM ESPECIALLY WITH MATH CONCENTRATION ON MATH BECAUSE BASICALLY YOU KNOW WE DON'T TEACH UM  (fe_03_01218-B-0008)
THE HIGHER LEVEL MATH COURSES UNTIL YOU GET LIKE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL WELL BASICALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_01218-B-0009)
AND IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW THEY WANT OUR STUDENTS BY THE TIME THEY GET TO COLLEGE THEIR FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE TO KNOW YOU KNOW LIKE TRIG AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT AND IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_01218-B-0010)
WE DON'T BECAUSE OUR KIDS DON'T GET THE CONCEPT THEY DON'T ALLOW THE TEACHERS YOU KNOW TO BASICALLY TEACH THE CONCEPT  (fe_03_01218-B-0011)
OF THE BEGINNING BASICS OF HIGHER LEVEL MATH DEALING WITH ALGEBRA WHERE WE CAN TEACH IT IN KINDERGARTEN BUT THEY DON'T ALLOW US TO DO IT THEY JUST YOU KNOW ALLOW US TO TEACH BASIC MATH YOU KNOW LIKE ADDITION SUBTRACTION MULTIPLICATION AND FRACTIONS  (fe_03_01218-B-0012)
WHICH IS THE BASICS FOR HIGHER LEVEL MATH BUT HOWEVER OUR KIDS ARE LOSING THAT CONCEPT ONCE THEY GET IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S NOT REPLICATED ANY MORE  (fe_03_01218-B-0013)
SO THAT'S WHY I JUST FEEL THAT OUR FAILURE AS TEACHERS AND AS ADMINISTRATORS ARE IS THAT WE BASICALLY DON'T TEACH OUR KIDS THE CONCEPTS ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH MATH THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST FAILURE MATH AND READING BASICALLY  (fe_03_01218-B-0014)
IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SO  (fe_03_01218-B-0015)
AND BA- YOU KNOW UH-HUH  (fe_03_01218-B-0016)
OH YEAH BECAUSE UM BASICALLY IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW BEFORE WHEN WE WERE IN SCHOOL YOU KNOW SCHOOL WENT A LITTLE BIT SMOOTHER BECAUSE OUR TEACHERS YOU KNOW WE WERE ALLOWED TO STAY TO THE BASICS  (fe_03_01218-B-0017)
NOW IT'S LIKE WE'RE TEACHING TO THE TEST  (fe_03_01218-B-0018)
YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH THE S._O._L.S WE'RE TEACHING TO THE TEST OF YOU KNOW HOW STUDENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO LEARN HISTORY AND HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] LEARN MATH AND SCIENCE AND SOCIAL STUDIES AND IT'S LIKE  (fe_03_01218-B-0019)
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ABLE TO BE CREATIVE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY SIT UP THERE AND THEY TELL US THEY TRAIN TEACHERS AND SAY OH YOU KNOW WELL YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01218-B-0020)
EVERY STUDENT LEARNS DIFFERENTLY WELL WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO TEACH THAT WAY WHERE YOU MIGHT BE A AUDITORY LEARNER AND THE OTHER STUDENT YOU KNOW MIGHT BE A VISUAL LEARNER  (fe_03_01218-B-0021)
WHERE THEY'RE NOT ALLOWING US THE S._O._L.S AREN'T NOT ALLOWING US TO TEACH IT TO THEM THAT WAY THEY JUST IT'S ON PAPER THIS IS WHAT'S ON THE TEST THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO LEARN  (fe_03_01218-B-0022)
BY THE TIME YOU TRAIN THEM TO TAKE THE TEST THEY MAY PASS AND THEY MAY NOT AND THEN WHEN THEY GO TO THE NEXT GRADE GUESS WHAT THEY'VE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01218-B-0023)
YOU KNOW THAT THAT TEST MATERIAL WAS ON THE YEAR BEFORE AND THEN THAT MEANS THE FOLLOWING YEAR YOU GOTTA PICK UP THE LAST YEAR'S PART AND THEN YOU GOTTA TACKLE THE NEW YEAR'S PART SO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01218-B-0024)
IT'S LIKE MAKE YOU KNOW IT'S A BACKWARD THING THAT YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING ON THE TEACHERS AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01218-B-0025)
EXACTLY EXACTLY THEY'RE PUSHING MORE STUDENTS INTO THE CLASS SIZES THEY'RE ENHANCING THEM AND THEN YOU HAVE ONE TEACHER THAT HAS LIKE THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY STUDENTS IN THE CLASS  (fe_03_01218-B-0026)
YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW YOU TRY YOU LIKE YOU KNOW YOU PASS BY THE ONES THAT ARE YOU KNOW GETTING IT YOU KNOW THAT ARE BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER  (fe_03_01218-B-0027)

MID LEVEL TO LOWER LEVEL LEARNING IS A MORE CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY GO HOME YOU KNOW WHATEVER I'VE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL IF THEY DIDN'T GET IT THAT DAY AND THEY GO HOME TO DO HOMEWORK GUESS WHAT MUM AND DAD DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT EITHER  (fe_03_01218-B-0029)

AND I THINK IT TURNED LIKE I WAS TURNED OFF BY MATH BECAUSE  (fe_03_01218-B-0037)
THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE I HAD I'VE NEVER REALISED UNTIL I GOT IN COLLEGE THAT I HAD A ANX- ANXIETY TOWARD MATH AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN I GOT TO THIRD GRADE AND [LAUGHTER] I WAS SUPPOSED TO LEARN FRACTIONS  (fe_03_01218-B-0038)
I DIDN'T LEARN IT 'CAUSE I DI- I JUST COULDN'T COMPREHEND IT I I DIDN'T GET THE CONCEPT OF IT SO I WENT THROUGH I ACTUALLY SKATED BY THROUGH MATH ALL YOU KNOW I MADE CS AND DS  (fe_03_01218-B-0039)

BECAUSE I HAD TO START IN A LOWER LEVEL YOU KNOW MATH THEN WHEN I GOT TO THE HIGHER LEVEL MATH I STILL HAD TO GET YOU KNOW A TUTOR YOU KNOW TO HELP ME THROUGH THE GEOMETRY OR THE TRIG PART OR WHATEVER BECAUSE  (fe_03_01218-B-0043)
IT'S JUST THAT DIFFICULT TO ME AND I THINK YOU KNOW UM  (fe_03_01218-B-0044)
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU KNOW TEACHERS OR ADMINISTRATION THEY DON'T LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTY THAT STUDENTS HAVE IN SCHOOL YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHERE THEIR ABILITIES ARE YOU KNOW WHERE  (fe_03_01218-B-0045)

AND LIKE I SAID IN THE BEGINNING YOU'RE SETTING THEM UP FOR FAILURE BECAUSE LIKE IN THE STATISTICS UM IT SAYS LIKE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF COLLEGE FRESHMEN END UP FLUNKING OUT OF SCHOOL OR GOING ON ACADEMIC PROBATION  (fe_03_01218-B-0052)
YOU KNOW THEIR FIRST SEMESTER OF COLLEGE  (fe_03_01218-B-0053)

YOU'RE NOT GIVING THAT CHILD YOU KNOW ALL YOU'RE DOING IS GIVING THEM ACADEMIC ACADEMICS YOU'RE FORCING ACADEMICS ON 'EM THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO  (fe_03_01218-B-0056)
EXPRESS THEIR CREATIVITY WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T REALISING YOUR CREATIVITY FLOWS OVER INTO THE ACADEMIC WORLD TOO  (fe_03_01218-B-0057)
