MY NAME IS SYLVENA BERRY UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0003)
I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS WRONG WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_01225-A-0004)
UM INCLUDING  (fe_03_01225-A-0005)
BUT NOT LIMITED TO  (fe_03_01225-A-0006)
THE  (fe_03_01225-A-0007)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0008)
THE  (fe_03_01225-A-0009)
BEING A ONE WORLD VIEW  (fe_03_01225-A-0011)
AND NOT HAVING A BALANCE  (fe_03_01225-A-0012)
UM [MN] PROVIDING BOTH CREATION AND UM EVOLUTION PROGRAMMES  (fe_03_01225-A-0013)
BEING OFFERED  (fe_03_01225-A-0014)
UM I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE AH  (fe_03_01225-A-0015)
FOSTER CARE PROGRAMME  (fe_03_01225-A-0016)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0017)
EXCEPT I'VE HAD FRIENDS THAT TRULY DID REAL LOVE AND HAVE A HEART FOR FOSTER CHILDREN BUT THAT'S THE EXTENT OF MY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEM  (fe_03_01225-A-0018)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01225-A-0019)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01225-A-0020)
I WONDER IF THAT IS GEOGRAPHIC  (fe_03_01225-A-0021)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0022)
IN SOME CASES I LIVE IN A FAIRLY RURAL AREA  (fe_03_01225-A-0023)
UM AND I DO KNOW THAT THERE IS  (fe_03_01225-A-0024)
A  (fe_03_01225-A-0025)
LARGER CONSIDERABLY LARGER PERCENTAGE OF FOSTER CARE IN THE IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM THAN WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_01225-A-0026)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0027)
I I WOULD SAY THAT IN MY AREA THAT THE  (fe_03_01225-A-0029)
THE NORM ARE ACTUALLY FAMILIES THAT ARE  (fe_03_01225-A-0030)
RELATIVELY STABLE JUST BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS MORE OF A RURAL AREA  (fe_03_01225-A-0031)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0032)
WELL I  (fe_03_01225-A-0034)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01225-A-0036)
WELL THE SCHOOLS TEND TO BE PLACED WITH  (fe_03_01225-A-0037)
MORE OF A BURDEN  (fe_03_01225-A-0038)
TO TAKE CARE OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND DISCIPLINARY UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0039)
AND VALUE UM GUIDANCE THAT THAT USED TO OCCUR IN THE FAMILY  (fe_03_01225-A-0040)
BUT THE FAMILIES HAVE GOTTEN SO BOGGED DOWN WITH  (fe_03_01225-A-0041)
HAVING BOTH PARENTS WORKING OR NOT HAVING BOTH PARENTS THERE AT ALL  (fe_03_01225-A-0042)
THAT THIS IS NO LONGER HAPPENING AT HOME AND NOW WE'VE PUSH- PUSHED ON TEACHERS THAT HAVE TOO MUCH OF A CLASS LOAD TO BE ABLE TO  (fe_03_01225-A-0043)
EVER BE ABLE TO  (fe_03_01225-A-0044)
HANDLE ANYTHING ANYTHING LIKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY WHICH ISN'T THEIRS IN THE FIRST PLACE  (fe_03_01225-A-0045)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01225-A-0046)
I'M I'M  (fe_03_01225-A-0047)
ARE YOU ON A CELLPHONE I'M HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFICULTY HEARING YOU  (fe_03_01225-A-0048)
HELLO  (fe_03_01225-A-0049)
ARE YOU ON A CELLPHONE  (fe_03_01225-A-0050)
YEAH IT'S GOING IN AND OUT FROM  (fe_03_01225-A-0051)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0052)
THAT'S BETTER  (fe_03_01225-A-0053)
UM I HEARD YOU VERY WELL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND JUST RECENTLY IT GOT IT GOT A LITTLE BIT WORSE  (fe_03_01225-A-0054)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0055)
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0056)
TRAINING THAT THEY GIVE YOU IN THE SCHOOLS I PERSONALLY HOME EDUCATE MY CHILDREN  (fe_03_01225-A-0057)
UM BECAUSE OF THE WEAKNESSES OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_01225-A-0058)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0059)
WHEN IN MY DAY THERE WERE TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS AND AS A HOME SCHOOLER I CAN'T FATHOM BEING ABLE TO NOTICE A THE WEAKNESSES AND THE STRENGTHS OF EACH AND EVERY CHILD  (fe_03_01225-A-0060)
THAT MANY STUDENTS MUCH LESS IF YOU'VE GOT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY STUDENTS  (fe_03_01225-A-0062)
AND AND WITH THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY STUDENTS SLIPPING BY AND GOING ILLITERATE UM I'VE GOT A FRIEND WHO GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AND CAN'T READ AND IT WAS JUST BECAUSE HE LEARNED TO PLAY THE GAME  (fe_03_01225-A-0063)
UM  (fe_03_01225-A-0064)
AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT A STUDENT WOULD BE THAT A TEACHER  (fe_03_01225-A-0065)
SHOULD BE  (fe_03_01225-A-0066)
REQUIRED TO AH  (fe_03_01225-A-0067)
TO  (fe_03_01225-A-0068)
KNOW HOW  (fe_03_01225-A-0069)
EACH CHILD IS PROGRESSING  (fe_03_01225-A-0070)
DAY TO DAY  (fe_03_01225-A-0071)
SO I JUST I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT A THAT A  (fe_03_01225-A-0072)
TEACHER CAN  (fe_03_01225-A-0073)
KNOW EXACTLY HOW EACH CHILD IS WITHOUT HAVING THEM SLIP THROUGH THE TRACKS THE THE CRACKS  (fe_03_01225-A-0074)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01225-A-0075)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01225-A-0076)
YEAH  (fe_03_01225-A-0077)
YEAH  (fe_03_01225-A-0078)
DO THEY  (fe_03_01225-A-0079)
DO THEY NO LONGER REQUIRE AS MUCH WRITING  (fe_03_01225-A-0080)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01225-A-0081)
WELL I ALSO BUT A LOT OF TIMES THEY SAY IF YOU PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SCHOOLS THAT IT'LL SOLVE EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01225-A-0082)
AND IN THE ONLY CASE THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE ONLY CASE  (fe_03_01225-A-0083)
BUT PRETTY DARN NEAR THE ONLY PLACE PLACE WHERE I THINK THAT REALLY IS EFFECTIVE IS BY OFFERING MORE MONEY TO TEACHERS IN ORDER TO GET MORE QUAL-  (fe_03_01225-A-0085)
HI THIS IS PAMELA AND YES ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_01225-B-0001)
IS THE INFLUX OF FOSTER CHILDREN  (fe_03_01225-B-0002)
WHO ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF BY FOSTER PARENTS  (fe_03_01225-B-0003)
AND THEY ARE BEING  (fe_03_01225-B-0004)
DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES  (fe_03_01225-B-0005)
TYPICALLY THESE STUDENTS ARE DISENFRANCHISED  (fe_03_01225-B-0006)
THEY ARE USUALLY GOING THROUGH  (fe_03_01225-B-0007)
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS  (fe_03_01225-B-0008)
AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE NOT  (fe_03_01225-B-0009)
THEY DON'T FEEL LOVED THEY DON'T FEEL SUPPORTED  (fe_03_01225-B-0010)
THE YOUNG MEN ARE EXTREMELY ANGRY  (fe_03_01225-B-0011)
THEY HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTY WITH CONCENTRATION IN A CLASSROOM SETTING  (fe_03_01225-B-0012)
EVEN WHEN THERE IS COLLABORATIVE  (fe_03_01225-B-0013)
ASSIGNMENTS  (fe_03_01225-B-0014)
EVEN WHEN THERE ARE INTERESTING THINGS TO DO  (fe_03_01225-B-0015)
THESE STUDENTS TYPICALLY STRUGGLE YEAR AFTER YEAR  (fe_03_01225-B-0016)
UM MANY TIMES THE FOSTER PARENTS ARE  (fe_03_01225-B-0017)
POORLY EDUCATION  (fe_03_01225-B-0018)
ARE NOT  (fe_03_01225-B-0019)
UM ABLE TO ADVOCATE WELL FOR THE STUDENTS  (fe_03_01225-B-0020)
OR THEY'RE REALLY JUST INVOLVED WITH THESE CHILDREN  (fe_03_01225-B-0021)

ARE BASICALLY USING THE CHILDREN'S FUNDING AS INCOME  (fe_03_01225-B-0030)
AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO REALLY MANAGE THAT MANY CHILDREN WITH EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS  (fe_03_01225-B-0031)
[COUGH] AND SO WHAT THEY'RE FINDING IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN A THEY'RE IN A SITUATION I'M SURE THEY MEAN WELL BUT THEY'RE IN WAY OVER THEIR HEAD THEY'RE OVERWHELMED I MEAN IF IF ANYONE HAS HAD TWO NORMAL CHILDREN  (fe_03_01225-B-0032)

THEIR IDEA OF TEACHING AND WHAT WHAT IS REALLY REQUIRED THESE DAYS IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CHANGING THE STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS  (fe_03_01225-B-0085)
AND MAKING THEM GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND AND BEGIN TO PICK UP ON NEWER MESSAGE OF DELIVERING KNOWLEDGE AND AND WORKING WITH KIDS  (fe_03_01225-B-0086)
