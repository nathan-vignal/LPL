HI  (fe_03_01246-A-0001)
I'M KIMBERLEY  (fe_03_01246-A-0002)
OH GOOD AT LEAST I GOT A FEMALE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01246-A-0003)
[LAUGHTER] I'M NOT SURE THAT REALLY MATTERS BUT ANYWAY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01246-A-0004)
[LAUGHTER] BUT FEMALES SOMETIMES HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING AH AND AS FAR AS THE ANSWER TO THEIR QUESTION I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA AT ALL ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT GIVES A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY TO PEOPLE  (fe_03_01246-A-0005)
BUT AH ANYHOW THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE ON IT AND WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE MY DEAR [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01246-A-0006)
[NOISE] YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_01246-A-0007)
OKAY WELL I JUST DIDN'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD YOU ARE SO I IT'S HARD TO KNOW THAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01246-A-0008)
WELL THE I THINK THE IDEA THAT THEY STARTED OUT WITH WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO WAS PROBABLY A GOOD THING BUT THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT  (fe_03_01246-A-0009)
LIKE MOST THINGS IT USUALLY GETS TAKEN WAY OUT OF CONTEXT OF WHAT IT WAS INITIALLY SUPPOSED TO BE  (fe_03_01246-A-0010)
AND NOW IT'S BASICALLY  (fe_03_01246-A-0011)
NOT AH HELPFUL TO ANYBODY ALL IT IS IS A  (fe_03_01246-A-0012)
CREATES A PROBLEM AND AH  (fe_03_01246-A-0013)
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T I JUST DON'T THINK THAT  (fe_03_01246-A-0015)
IT GIVES PEOPLE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY OF WHO THEY ARE AND IT GETS THEM HIRED FOR THEIR COLOR OF THEIR SKIN OR WHATEVER BUT THEN WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO DOING THE WORK  (fe_03_01246-A-0016)
BUSINESSES SUFFER AND SO DO A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT SOMEBODY IN THERE WHO'S NOT QUALIFIED TO DO THE JOB  (fe_03_01246-A-0017)
AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING  (fe_03_01246-A-0018)
YEAH AS SOMEONE WHO IS A BUSINESS OWNER I JUST DON'T AGREE WITH HIRING SOMEONE [NOISE] JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CERTAIN COLOR OF SKIN I DON'T AGREE WITH NOT HIRING SOMEBODY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN EITHER BUT AT THE SAME TIME  (fe_03_01246-A-0020)
IF THEY'RE NOT QUA- IF SOMEBODY WHO'S WHITE IS MORE QUALIFIED AT THE JOB THAN SOMEONE WHO'S BLACK THEN I WANT THE PERSON WHO'S MORE QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN  (fe_03_01246-A-0021)
IF THEY'RE BLACK OR THEY'RE ASIAN OR WHATEVER I DON'T CARE YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] BUT AH ANYHOW UM  (fe_03_01246-A-0022)
UM BUT THAT'S BASICALLY  (fe_03_01246-A-0023)
MY PERSPECTIVE ON IT I THINK THAT THEY CAN  (fe_03_01246-A-0024)
JUST GET CAUGHT IN THE CYCLE WHERE THEY JUST GET A JOB IT'S KIND OF LIKE OUR GOVERNMENT JOBS THESE DAYS WHICH IS A REALLY BAD SITUATION BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE IN THERE WHO KNOW THEY CAN'T GET FIRED AND SO THEY JUST  (fe_03_01246-A-0027)
DON'T REALLY WORK [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01246-A-0028)
YEAH WELL  (fe_03_01246-A-0029)
IT'S AND IT'S CAUSING LOTS OF PROBLEMS THESE DAYS BECAUSE AS A BUSINESS OWNER Y- YOU GET PEOPLE IN HERE AH WELL EVEN NOT AS ACTUALLY AS A BUSINESS OWNER AS MUCH AS A AH  (fe_03_01246-A-0030)
THE COUNTY JOBS AND STUFF IT'S LIKE THE SOCIAL SERVICES IS REALLY A LOUSY JOB O- O- O- LOUSY  (fe_03_01246-A-0031)
COMMUNITY THESE DAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO OR WHATEVER AND I'M CERTAINLY I'M NOT TRYING TO THROW ANY COLD WATER I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO SO I GUESS I BETTER HOLD ON AND ASK THAT QUESTION  (fe_03_01246-A-0032)
[LAUGHTER] OH OKAY WELL YOU SOUNDED YOUNG BUT I DIDN'T KNOW  (fe_03_01246-A-0033)

OH OKAY WELL THAT'S ALL GOOD THAT'S GOOD THAT'S A AND WE CAN ALWAYS USE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO PAY ATTENTION TO THE THE WEATHER FORMATIONS AND EVERYTHING OUT THERE SO  (fe_03_01246-A-0037)
AND WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THEM OUT THERE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] SINCE I CALL THE WEATHER BUREAU ALMOST EVERY DAY TO FIND OUT WHAT TO EXPECT THAT DAY IT'S KIND OF NICE WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GET IT RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01246-A-0038)
BUT AH UNFORTUNATELY YOU ALSO CAN'T CONTROL WHAT  (fe_03_01246-A-0039)
THAT THINGS HAPPEN AND STUFF THAT CHANGES OVERNIGHT SOMETIMES AND  (fe_03_01246-A-0040)
BUT ANYHOW AH NOW THE GOING BACK TO THE THE TOPIC AT HAND OR WHATEVER AH  (fe_03_01246-A-0041)
IT'S LIKE RIGHT NOW THE SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT UM I I HAD BEEN ON WELFARE SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN I LOST ANOTHER BUSINESS AND AH BASICALLY GOT TREATED LIKE I WAS A CRIMINAL OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_01246-A-0042)

AND THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THAT S- STRUCTURE WHO  (fe_03_01246-A-0044)
THEY WEREN'T AS INTERESTED IN TRYING TO HELP YOU GET OUT OF WELFARE AS THEY WERE INTERESTED IN HAVING YOU FOLLOW THEIR RULES WHICH MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER [LAUGHTER] TO ME  (fe_03_01246-A-0045)
[LAUGHTER] BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'D HAVE IT SET UP TO WHERE YOU VIRTUALLY YOU'RE STUCK BEING ON WELFARE BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY TO GET OUT UNLESS YOU REALLY ARE WILLING TO TAKE SOME CHANCES AND AH  (fe_03_01246-A-0046)

BASICALLY HAVING IT SO THAT THEY IF SOMEONE CAN GET HIRED FOR THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN ITS' REALLY SCARY BECAUSE YOU GET PEOPLE INTO AN OFFICE ESPECIALLY IN  (fe_03_01246-A-0053)
AH WHERE SOCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT AND IT SO THAT THEY  (fe_03_01246-A-0054)
THEY THEY'RE BASICALLY GUARANTEED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THAT WAS THE NAME OF IT BUT AH THAT THEY'RE GUARANTEED THEIR JOB JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CERTAIN COLOR OF SKIN THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT  (fe_03_01246-A-0055)
THEY CAN GET IN THERE AND THEN THEY THEN NOBODY CAN GET RID OF THEM AND GET SOMEBODY WHO CAN ACTUALLY DO THE JOB PROPERLY AND  (fe_03_01246-A-0056)
AH ESPECIALLY IN GOVERNMENTAL POSITIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT IT'S A REALLY SCARY PLACE TO BE BECAUSE THEY HAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THEIR HANDS AND  (fe_03_01246-A-0057)

BE THERE AND THEY JUST WANT SOMETHING THAT'S SAFE AND DEPENDABLE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ANY RISK AND AH UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THEM AREN'T WILLING TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOB THEY JUST WANT A JOB  (fe_03_01246-A-0063)
THAT PAYS THEM AND THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IN THE PROCESS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THIS COUNTRY HAS  (fe_03_01246-A-0064)
GOT A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS IT DOES IS BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO'VE GOTTEN WHERE THEY WANTED DEPEND ON THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM INSTEAD OF THEM TAKING CARE OF THE GOVERNMENT  (fe_03_01246-A-0065)
