THE MORE TROUBLE WE HAVE  (fe_03_01216-A-0022)
WELL THEY CANNOT PROVE EVOLUTION  (fe_03_01216-A-0023)
AND THAT'S THEIR SAME ARGUMENT FOR CREATIONISM  (fe_03_01216-A-0024)
IT'S A THEORY  (fe_03_01216-A-0025)
WELL THEY SHOULD BE GENUINE ABOUT THEIR THEIR UH OPEN MINDEDNESS AND YES AND AND LET THE KIDS OR THE PEOPLE UH MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS  (fe_03_01216-A-0026)
