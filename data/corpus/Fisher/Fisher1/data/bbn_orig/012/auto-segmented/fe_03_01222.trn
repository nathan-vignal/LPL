IN IN THE DEVOTED TO THE  (fe_03_01222-A-0023)
TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE REASON OR ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY IS BECAUSE DESPITE ALL OF OUR TALKING WE DO NOT REALLY VALUE EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY WE ARE MUCH TOO  (fe_03_01222-A-0024)

SO THAT'S MY FIRST COMPLAINT BUT MY SECOND COMPLAINT IS THAT  (fe_03_01222-A-0034)
WE  (fe_03_01222-A-0035)
IN THIS COUNTRY THE POLITICIANS HAVE FAR TOO MUCH INFLUENCE  (fe_03_01222-A-0036)
OVER WHAT GOES ON IN THE SCHOOL THEY NEED TO BACK OFF AND LET THE TEACHERS AND THE EDUCATORS RUN THE SCHOOLS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DICTATE THINGS LIKE STANDARDIZED TESTS THAT WE KNOW DON'T WORK  (fe_03_01222-A-0037)
