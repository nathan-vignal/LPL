[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01242-B-0006)
YEAH  (fe_03_01242-B-0007)
OH MY OPINION ON THAT IS I THINK THEY SH- SHOULD GO WITHIN NOT WITHIN THE COMPANY TRY TO PROMOTE WITHIN THE COMPANY THEY SH- THEY SHOULD TRY IF PEOPLE GO  (fe_03_01242-B-0008)
WANT TO GET HIRED THEY SHOULD PR- IF THEY GET HIRED AND THEY COME IN IF THEY'RE QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION THEY SHOULD GET HIRED FOR THAT POSITION THAT'S  (fe_03_01242-B-0009)
MY OPINION  (fe_03_01242-B-0010)
YEAH  (fe_03_01242-B-0011)
MHM  (fe_03_01242-B-0012)
THAT'S MY OPINION YEAH  (fe_03_01242-B-0013)
YEAH THEY AND THEY SOMETIMES DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE WOMEN TOO  (fe_03_01242-B-0015)
IN THE BUSINESS BECAUSE I  (fe_03_01242-B-0016)
BECAUSE I WAS LET GO FROM A JOB  (fe_03_01242-B-0017)
YOU KNOW I THINK WELL IT WAS IT WAS TWO OF US THEY HAD TO THE ONE GIRL HAD MORE  (fe_03_01242-B-0018)
UM  (fe_03_01242-B-0019)
KNEW MORE ABOUT THE FRONT DESK THAN I DID AND SHE AND SHE WAS FULL TIME AND I WAS FULL TIME AND THEY COULDN'T HAVE BOTH OF US SO THEY LET ME GO C- BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AH COULDN'T PUT MY ON PART TIME BECAUSE THEY ALREADY PART TIMERS FOR THE FRONT DESK WORK  (fe_03_01242-B-0020)
AND THEY -SCRIMINATE BECAUSE THEY DON'T GIVE YOU RAISES WHEN THEY SHOULD GIVE YOU RAISES  (fe_03_01242-B-0021)
AND THEY ALWAYS GIVE THE GUYS I THINK THEY THINK A GUY'S MORE IMPORTANT WHEN THEY'RE AT THE TOP THAN A WOMAN IS TO GET THE TOP JOB THEY DON'T THINK WOMEN CAN HANDLE THOSE KIND OF POSITIONS  (fe_03_01242-B-0022)
SOMETIMES THEY DO BECAUSE THEY THINK SOME COMPANIES THINK THEY HAVE TO HIRE A CERTAIN OF AMOUNT OF COLOR- THE UM MINORITY  (fe_03_01242-B-0023)
AND THEY CAN'T AND IF THEY'VE GOT A PERSON THAT'S HANDICAPPED IN THE POSITION THEY CAN'T LET THEY AND THEY THEY HAVE TO LET SOMEBODY GO THEY'RE BETTER OFF LETTING THE PERSON THAT'S  (fe_03_01242-B-0024)
CAN GET ANOTHER JOB REAL EASY THEN TO K- AND KEEP THE ONE THAT'S GOT THE HANDICAP BECAUSE OTHERWISE THAT PERSON'S GOING TO SAY THEY'RE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE THEY HAD A HANDICAP  (fe_03_01242-B-0025)
YEAH  (fe_03_01242-B-0026)
YEAH THAT'S TRUE TOO [NOISE]  (fe_03_01242-B-0027)
YEAH AND THE SAME WITH WAGE WISE STILL GIVING WAGE EARNINGS  (fe_03_01242-B-0029)
THEY'LL GIVE MORE TO ONE PERSON THAN BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE BETTER AH THE GUY WILL GET MORE  (fe_03_01242-B-0030)
WAGE RAISE AND THEN TWO PEOPLE HAVE A CH- CAN GET IT AND ONE OR THE OTHER ONE GETS IT AND YOU DON'T GET IT IT MEANS THAT THEY THINK THE GUY'S A BETTER  (fe_03_01242-B-0031)
POTENTIAL FOR DOING THE JOB BETTER THAN YOU ARE  (fe_03_01242-B-0032)
AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG TO FOR IT TO BE THAT WAY  (fe_03_01242-B-0033)
AND SO COMPANIES WHO GIVE RAISES REAL FAST AND STUFF AND THEN WE DON'T GET WE DON'T AND AND THE COMPANY I WORK FOR THEY DON'T DESERVED A RAISE THEY GIVE YOU A RAISE THEY DIDN'T GO LIKE AFTER THIRTY DAYS YOU GET A RAISE OR AFTER  (fe_03_01242-B-0034)
NINETY DAYS PROBATION THEY GIVE YOU A RAISE IF THEY THINK YOU'RE  (fe_03_01242-B-0035)
EVALUATE YOUR JOB AND YOUR ABILITY AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND THEY THINK YOU DESERVE A RAISE THEY GIVE IT TO YOU IF YOU DESERVE AN HONORABLE MENTION THEY'LL GIVE IT TO YOU  (fe_03_01242-B-0037)

I TOOK DOWN ON I WHEN I WENT TO DO THIS THING I TOOK DOWN ALL THE INFORMATION OFF THE COMPUTE- OFF THE COMPUTER SO I HAVE ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY WERE WERE GOING TO ASK  (fe_03_01242-B-0044)
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A JOB AND I HAD TO GET A JOB AND I WOULD USE THIS AS ONE OF MY THINGS FOR GETTING WORK  (fe_03_01242-B-0046)
DO YOU WORK AT ALL  (fe_03_01242-B-0047)

SO I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THEY SOMETIMES THEY GIVE YOU SOMETHING AND THEY SAY IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S ABOUT AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ACCEPT IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT IT EITHER  (fe_03_01242-B-0055)
WELL IF THEY ASKED ABOUT ANY SPORTS I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT SOME THINGS BUT NOT ANY [LAUGHTER] NOT A LOT OF THINGS ON T._V. I DON'T WA- WATCH A LOT OF SPORTS  (fe_03_01242-B-0057)

YUP  (fe_03_01242-B-0059)
BUT THAT'S NOT ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALK [LAUGHTER] ABOUT  (fe_03_01242-B-0060)
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG YOU CAN TALK ON THIS SUBJECT  (fe_03_01242-B-0061)
A HARD THING [MN]  (fe_03_01242-B-0063)

YEAH  (fe_03_01242-B-0067)

AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT FREAK BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET THEIR RATES IN THEIR COMPANY  (fe_03_01242-B-0069)
IF THERE'S A CHOICE BETWEEN A WOMAN OR A MAN USUALLY SOMETIMES WELL ONCE IN A WHILE WOMEN WILL GET THE POSITION BUT A LOT OF TIMES THE GUY GETS IT BECAUSE THEY THINK HE'S BETTER QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION THAN A WOMAN IS  (fe_03_01242-B-0070)
OR IT COULD BE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TAKE WELL THEY HAVE TO GIVE IT TO A MINORITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE ONE MINORITY UP IN THAT POSITION  (fe_03_01242-B-0071)
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR TO THE PERSON THAT HAD THE WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE  (fe_03_01242-B-0072)
OH YOU ARE  (fe_03_01242-B-0073)

THE COMPANY WENT AND SAID THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE KEPT US ON BUT DIDN'T HAVE ANY POSITIONS AVAILABLE FOR US  (fe_03_01242-B-0081)
AND THE JOBS THAT THEY WERE DOING THEY WERE HIRING F- LIKE I WAS IN COULD DO DAY CARE BUT THEY WANTED THE DAY CARE TO DO HALF DAY CARE HALF FRONT DESK AND I COULDN'T DO BOTH  (fe_03_01242-B-0082)

AH AT THE FRONT DESK TO DO  (fe_03_01242-B-0084)
NOW THEY GOT THREE TIMES MORE WORK TO DO AT THE FRONT DESK THAN WE USED TO HAVE  (fe_03_01242-B-0085)
