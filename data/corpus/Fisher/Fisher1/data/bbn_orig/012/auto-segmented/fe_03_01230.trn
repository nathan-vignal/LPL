UH-HUH  (fe_03_01230-A-0006)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01230-A-0007)
I THINK SO TOO I I AH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF LACK OF MOTIVATION LIKE IN SOME OF THE TEACHERS THAT ESPECIALLY SECONDARY EDUCATION  (fe_03_01230-A-0008)
AND SO WHEN THEY HAVE A LACK OF YOU KNOW MOTIVATION TO PUT EFFORT INTO TEACHING THE KIDS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THINGS SLIP  (fe_03_01230-A-0009)
AND THEY DON'T TEACH AS WELL AND THE KIDS DON'T LEARN AS MUCH AND IT JUST BECOMES SOMETHING THAT'S REQUIRED THAT YOU KNOW TO GO ON TO COLLEGE FIRST  (fe_03_01230-A-0010)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01230-A-0011)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01230-A-0012)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01230-A-0013)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_01230-A-0018)
RIGHT IT IT COSTS A LOT MORE  (fe_03_01230-A-0019)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01230-A-0020)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01230-A-0021)

RIGHT  (fe_03_01230-A-0025)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01230-A-0026)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_01230-A-0027)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01230-A-0028)
WELL WHEN I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL ESPECIALLY MIDDLE SCHOOL IN HIGH SCHOOL UM  (fe_03_01230-A-0029)
OF COURSE I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE ALWAYS LOVED TO LEARN SO I I LOVE TAKING CHALLENGING  (fe_03_01230-A-0030)
COURSES AND I TOOK A LOT OF MY EDUCATION SERIOUSLY BUT  (fe_03_01230-A-0031)
I JUST NOTICE THAT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF I GUESS UM SOME OF SOME OF THE TEACHERS LIKE YOU SAID THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE HIGHLY DEDICATED BUT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE LACK OF MOTIVATION FOR SOME OF THE TEACHERS  (fe_03_01230-A-0032)
IT JUST ENDED UP BEING LIKE A FARM HOUSE YOU KNOW THERE'D BE STUDENTS THAT  (fe_03_01230-A-0033)
THEY YOU KNOW I HAD AN AN ALGEBRA CLASS ACTUALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE TEACHER TALKED ABOUT BASEBALL THE WHOLE TIME  (fe_03_01230-A-0034)
AND SO HE'D GIVE US OUR ASSIGNMENTS AND THEN TALK WITH LIKE THOSE THAT WERE ON THE BASEBALL TEAM AND FOOTBALL TEAM ABOUT SPORTS ALL THE TIME  (fe_03_01230-A-0035)
WHICH WASN'T NECESSARILY BAD BUT IT JUST WASN'T VERY PRODUCTIVE FOR OUR TIME AND SO I I THINK I THINK WITH THE PUBLIC SYSTEM I MEAN THERE'S FLAWS AND I WISH LIKE I THINK IF I DON'T HOW SINCE THEY'RE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY ON  (fe_03_01230-A-0036)
ON YOU KNOW ANTI TERRORISM AND SO FORTH RIGHT NOW BUT UM IF THEY COULD INCREASE MAYBE THE PAYROLL OF SOME OF THE TEACHERS THEN IT WOULD BE MORE APPEALING TO PEOPLE OUT IN THE YOU KNOW IN THE JOB MARKET TO BECOME TEACHERS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE A TALENT TO TEACH REALLY WELL  (fe_03_01230-A-0037)
AND SO  (fe_03_01230-A-0038)
I THINK AH  (fe_03_01230-A-0039)
THAT'S HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE PUBLIC EDUCATION A LOT IS MAYBE BY PAYING THE TEACHERS MORE SO IT'S MORE APPEALING AND AND ALSO MAKING IT MORE ORGANIZED  (fe_03_01230-A-0040)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01230-A-0041)
YEAH I WOULD AGREE  (fe_03_01230-A-0042)

WELL I'M A LITTLE OLDER THAN THAT SO  (fe_03_01230-B-0006)
AND I SEND MY CHILDREN TO PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM I DO BELIEVE IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_01230-B-0007)
SO UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0008)
BUT IF THE QUESTION WAS DO  (fe_03_01230-B-0009)

AND SO OBVIOUSLY  (fe_03_01230-B-0011)
I DON'T KNOW THAT SOMETHINGS WRONG  (fe_03_01230-B-0012)
BUT I JUST THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0013)
THERE'S BETTER OUT THERE  (fe_03_01230-B-0014)
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_01230-B-0015)
RIGHT  (fe_03_01230-B-0016)
RIGHT AND THEY JUST KIND OF PUSH YOU THROUGH  (fe_03_01230-B-0017)
TRYING TO GET YOU THROUGH UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0018)
TO  (fe_03_01230-B-0019)
SAY YOU GRADUATED BASICALLY  (fe_03_01230-B-0020)
AND BUT THEN WHEN YOU GO ON PASSED THAT YOU HAVE PROBLEMS  (fe_03_01230-B-0021)
AND THERE'S MORE OF A CHANCE OF BEING DROP OUTS AND THERE ARE THOSE THAT GO THROUGH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND DO WONDERFUL YOU KNOW AND AND I THINK THAT THE  (fe_03_01230-B-0022)
THE TEACHERS CAN KIND OF SINGLE SOME OF THEM OUT  (fe_03_01230-B-0023)
AND AH AS IN ANY SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHERS CAN SINGLE THE THE THE BETTER ONES OUT AND AND MOTIVATE BETTER AND THEIR HANDS ARE TIED WITH THE ONES THAT THEY'RE KIND OF AFRAID OF  (fe_03_01230-B-0024)
UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0025)
I KNOW HERE IN  (fe_03_01230-B-0026)
IN AH PUBLIC SCHOOL HERE WE HAVE UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0027)
A FEDERAL PROGRAMME TO HELP  (fe_03_01230-B-0028)
DROP OUTS AH  (fe_03_01230-B-0029)
AND PUT KIDS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AH THAT ARE ON THE VERGE OF DROPPING OUT AND HAVE BAD GRADES  (fe_03_01230-B-0030)
AND PREGNANT MOMS OR WHATEVER THING YOU KNOW IN THE HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_01230-B-0031)
AND IT'S IT'S WORKED A LOT TO HELP MOTIVATE THE KIDS TO HAVE UM MENTORS THAT ARE CLOSER THEIR OWN AGE  (fe_03_01230-B-0032)
UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0033)
WORKING WITH THEM  (fe_03_01230-B-0034)
AND AH  (fe_03_01230-B-0035)
IT WAS A U._S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GRANT  (fe_03_01230-B-0036)
THAT UM THIS THE  (fe_03_01230-B-0037)
PROGRAMME THAT THE SCHOOL GOT HERE  (fe_03_01230-B-0038)
THROUGH ANOTHER PRO- THROUGH ANOTHER AGENCY  (fe_03_01230-B-0039)
AND IT IT WAS REALLY WORKING AND NOW WITH THE FUNDING AND  (fe_03_01230-B-0040)
A LOT OF KIDS ARE KIND OF GOING TO BE PUT OUT BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MORE GRANTS NOW  (fe_03_01230-B-0041)
BUT UM IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR THOSE KIDS THAT WERE DROPPING OUT  (fe_03_01230-B-0042)
A- WHERE THEY KIND OF GET LEFT  (fe_03_01230-B-0043)
LEFT TO FLOUNDER I THINK  (fe_03_01230-B-0044)
IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND YOU CAN FIND THOSE IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS TOO BUT THERE'S MORE MOTIVATION BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE PAYING FOR IT  (fe_03_01230-B-0045)
YEAH AND UM YOU KNOW IF THE KIDS ARE SCREWING AROUND THE PARENTS ARE GOING TO KNOW ABOUT IT  (fe_03_01230-B-0046)
WHERE IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL  (fe_03_01230-B-0047)
THEY'RE KIND OF ON THEIR OWN AND IT'S KIND OF YOU KNOW LIKE THEY'RE BRINGING THEMSELVES UP ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY GET TO THAT AGE  (fe_03_01230-B-0048)
SO I THINK THAT UM THE TEACHERS  (fe_03_01230-B-0049)
ARE IN IT FOR THE MONEY AS MUCH AS THERE MAY NOT BE THAT HIGH A THE SALARY IT'S BETTER THAN PRIVATE SCHOOLS TUITION OR A PRIVATE SCHOOL PAY [NOISE] FOR TEACHERS  (fe_03_01230-B-0050)
YEAH IT IS AND UM AND YET THE SCHOOLS COST A LOT OF MONEY YOU KNOW [NOISE]  (fe_03_01230-B-0051)
FOR OTHER PROGRAMMES  (fe_03_01230-B-0052)
[NOISE] SO UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0053)
[NOISE] YOU KNOW WHEN THEY CAN GO ON STRIKE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME DEDICATED PEOPLE ANYWHERE YOU GO  (fe_03_01230-B-0054)
PRIVATE SCHOOL PUBLIC SCHOOL UM [NOISE] AND THERE ARE SOME DEDICATED STUDENTS YOU GET SOME GOOD AND SOME FANTASTIC KIDS THROUGH PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01230-B-0055)
UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0056)
IT'S JUST THAT I SEE SO MANY SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND LIKE YOU SAID NO MOTIVATION  (fe_03_01230-B-0057)
UM THERE'S NO  (fe_03_01230-B-0058)
NO BIG INCENTIVE YOU KNOW YOU GO AND YOU GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO  (fe_03_01230-B-0059)
AND AH ANYWAY THAT'S MY OPINION SO NOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01230-B-0060)
WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_01230-B-0061)
YEAH WELL  (fe_03_01230-B-0063)
BUT  (fe_03_01230-B-0064)
BUT I THINK IS THEY NEED TO BE WORTH THEIR PAY  (fe_03_01230-B-0065)
YOU KNOW SO THE CRITERIA NEEDS TO BE STRICTER MAYBE THOUGH  (fe_03_01230-B-0066)
FOR THE FOR THEM TO BECOME TEACHERS AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE NOT JUST ANYBODY CAN DO IT  (fe_03_01230-B-0067)
UM AND IT HAS TO BE PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY UM ORIENTED WITH KIDS IT CAN'T JUST BE YOU  (fe_03_01230-B-0068)
KNOW SOMEONE THAT'S  (fe_03_01230-B-0069)
JUST SMART YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_01230-B-0070)
SOMEONE WHO'S WILLING TO WHO'S GOOD WITH THE KIDS AND TO GET RIGHT DOWN THERE  (fe_03_01230-B-0071)
YOU KNOW AND SOMETIMES THE OLDER TEACHERS JUST DON'T HAVE IT YOU KNOW TH- THE KIDS JUST DON'T RESPECT THEM  (fe_03_01230-B-0072)
AND AH  (fe_03_01230-B-0073)
THEY HAVE TO KEEP THAT RESPECT  (fe_03_01230-B-0074)
AND AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING I SEE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01230-B-0075)
IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SO LITTLE RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER  (fe_03_01230-B-0076)
AND FOR TEACHERS AND UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0077)
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE THERE  (fe_03_01230-B-0078)
AND THE TEACHERS KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE THERE  (fe_03_01230-B-0079)
YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE  (fe_03_01230-B-0080)
LIKE YOU SAID WHERE'S THE MOTIVATION WHERE'S THE  (fe_03_01230-B-0081)
YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN IT FOR THE KIDS  (fe_03_01230-B-0082)
SO AND THEY DON'T REALISE  (fe_03_01230-B-0083)
GOING THROUGH ESPECIALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL AT THAT AGE THAT UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0084)
LIFE IS IS JUST BEGINNING  (fe_03_01230-B-0085)
AND THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FROM THIS POINT OUT  (fe_03_01230-B-0086)
AND AH IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM SOME TIME LITTLE LONGER TO REALISE THAT  (fe_03_01230-B-0087)
YOU KNOW YOU'RE TWENTY TWO YOU'RE GETTING TO THE AGE WHERE UM YOU'RE PROBABLY SEEING IT NOW YOU KNOW I WISH I MAYBE DIDN'T DO THAT OR  (fe_03_01230-B-0088)
I'M GLAD I LEARNED FROM DOING THAT [LAUGHTER] TYPE OF THING  (fe_03_01230-B-0089)
UM  (fe_03_01230-B-0090)

I LOOK BACK AND SAY  (fe_03_01230-B-0094)
YOU KNOW I WENT TO PRIVATE SCHOOL AND I TRIED TO HELP KIDS I HAD A MY BEST FRIEND WAS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01230-B-0095)
AND I WAS A GRADE AHEAD OF HER  (fe_03_01230-B-0096)
AS FAR AS OUR SCHOOL WORK BUT WE WERE IN THE SAME GRADE WE WERE BOTH IN FIFTH GRADE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_01230-B-0097)
AND I COULD HELP HER WITH HER HOMEWORK BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY DONE THAT  (fe_03_01230-B-0098)
AND I'M IN I WAS IN PRIVATE SCHOOL SHE WAS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01230-B-0099)
AND SO EVEN THOUGH ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_01230-B-0101)
STANDARDS  (fe_03_01230-B-0102)
TO ME SHE WAS DOING LIKE FOURTH GRADE WORK AND SHE WAS IN THE FIFTH GRADE  (fe_03_01230-B-0103)
AND I WAS YOU KNOW I COULD HELP HER WITH HER SUBJECTS BECAUSE I'D ALREADY HAD ALL THAT  (fe_03_01230-B-0104)
AND SO I YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT THE PRIVATE SCHOOL YOU GET A BETTER EDUCATION  (fe_03_01230-B-0105)
AND AND PUBLIC SCHOOL THEY THEY HAVE TO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_01230-B-0106)
THE KIDS HAVE TO BE THERE BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO LEARN  (fe_03_01230-B-0107)
