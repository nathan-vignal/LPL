R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is David Vu[?]
R:  Hi, David.  Uh, my name is Cindy Ray[?]
L:  Hi, Cindy.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm -- I'm good.  Where are you at?
L:  Um ... I'm in um Davis, California, Davis.
R:  Davis?  Okay.  I'm in Bakersfield[?] so we're not too far away from each other.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] really?  Are -- are you a student?
R:  No, I'm not.  I'm a mystery shopper [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah um ... I -- I'm in Davis um I'm -- I'm currently a student.  I'm -- I'm in my junior year.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  Yeah.  We got a final coming up this week.
R:  Oh, gosh.  What are you majoring in?
L:  Um, I'm majoring in uh electrical engineering.
R:  Ooh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a wonderful field.
L:  Oh, yeah but I mean, now the job market's down, so I -- I don't know what's gonna happen.
R:  Well, I don't think any of us know what's gonna happen now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  It really is kind of up in the air.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what do you think about this question? [LAUGH]
L:  Ah [LAUGH] uh, you know what?  If to me personally, I wouldn't do it 'cause, you know, best friends are hard to come by and personally, I -- I on- -- like, in my life, I only have one best friend who I'm still friends with and -- and, you know, it ... best friend for me is very hard to come by and come by where, like, you know, you can share him uh ... you can share with him or her, like, you know, almost everything, you know?
R:  Right.  [MN]
L:  And I mean -- I think money isn't worth the friendship.
R:  I don't either.  It's -- it -- it almost feels like you're selling your friend, you know what I mean?
L:  Yes -- yeah, yeah.
R:  And -- and I -- you know, and I'm much older than you are and um and I gotta tell ya, good friends really aren't easy to come by ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... and they're not easy to keep either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, so when you -- when you find one that -- that you can really say is your best friend, you know, boy, you better hold onto that person because, you know, they're few and far between.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, like, I have a -- I have a friend where like, we knew each other since um, way back in Vietnam ... um ... like ever since I was in second grade?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, I mean, when -- when we come over to the United States, I live in ... um in Sacramento and he's in um San Diego.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I mean, like, I mean, we still keep in touch, you know, so I mean ... I mean, we still keep in touch to this day.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah and um ... so, you know, it's -- it's --
R:  I mean, can you just imagine -- I mean, what would you say to your friend ...
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  ... Oh, you know, we can't be friends any more.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just, you know, our friendship is only worth a million dollars and I took the money, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean [LAUGH] ... that's ... I -- I mean, like, that -- kind of friendship, I mean, some people go through life, they can have a lot of friends ...
R:  Right.
L:  ... but then they -- they can never experience, like, best friends, that -- that kind of friendship quality, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I- I've always said, you know, you can have hundreds and hundreds of acquaintances but very few good friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very few.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  You know and it's -- and it's something really special, I think, if you can find somebody that you trust, you know and -- and you know you can tell them anything because they're not gonna put you down, they're not gonna, you know, [SIGH] ... they're not gonna ditch you, they're not gonna go behind your back, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know what you're saying.
R:  They're -- they're somebody that you can -- you can count on and it's -- like I said before, I'm telling you what, that is really hard to find.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, when -- when you talk about best friends, you have to, like, take into consideration, like, you know, like, when you just have regular friends ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  ... I mean, if they are competitive with you, you can have jealousy and competition and, you know, yeah, you can have friends like that but you cannot have a best friend like that, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.  I w- -- I wouldn't do it.  I don't -- you know, there are still lots of times in my life, you know, and probably just this morning, I said, "Boy, I wish I had a million bucks" [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But [LAUGH] but you know, when you think about it, what would you do for that million dollars and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I [SIGH] an anonymous benefactor.  I mean, first of all, I -- I'd have some questions about that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd -- you know, I -- I guess I'm too suspicious by nature, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who are you?  What is it you really want [LAUGH] you know?  Am I selling my soul here, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.  A little bit like that movie um, oh, that movie with Bra- --
R:  Oh, that Al Pacino movie?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And Keanu Reeves?
L:  [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I love that movie [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] oh.  But um yeah.  I -- I -- you know, I mean, money, you can never have enough of it, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But at the same time, I mean, a person with a whole bunch of money and no -- and no love or happiness ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... then, no.  I -- I'd rather not.
R:  Me too.  Me too 'cause ... 'cause like I said, the older I -- the older I get, the more perspective you get on life, you know and hopefully learn [LAUGH] from your mistakes and your priorities start changing, you know and -- and when you're young, you know, you go to school, you work really hard, you know.  You're trying to build a future, you're just driven, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And money seems to be real important but when you get older, it -- it just isn't that important any more.
L:  Yeah.  I mean -- I mean, to -- to me, like, let's say, Bill Gate right now ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, money is nothing to him but --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, there's a lot of people out there that [MN] just doesn't, like him.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, like, th- they -- I mean, there are people who just want to get -- get, you know, with them because of his money, you know and you know, you can never find, you know, true friendship or true love that way, you know?
R:  Mhm.  I just -- and I wonder, you know, how many people, because they have all that money, how many people can he really say are his true friends?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That don't have some alternative motive behind, you know, getting close to Bill Gates.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's -- that's true.
R:  And they'd -- they'd always be hitting you up.  I mean, [SIGH] who wants money on that -- that amount of money.  I would like to be comfortable ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  ... and -- and not worry about um whether I'm gonna pay the PG and E bill next month, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or the telephone bill [LAUGH] or whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um ... and I'd like to have a little bit locked away for, you know, in case you get sick, you can't work, you -- you know, th- those kinds of things and -- and build a little bit of a retirement but to have a -- a large amount of money, just think of the -- of the uh headaches that you all -- all of a sudden -- things that you've never had to deal with before.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  That's true.  I mean --
R:  And I -- and I just don't think money brings happiness.  I think it just brings a whole bunch of -- of extra problems [LAUGH] that you don't have [LAUGH] [MN] --
L:  I mean -- enough money to use is happiness.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But -- but when you have too much money, then, you know, you always have to watch your back, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  So, why would I give up my best friend ...
L:  [SIGH]
R:  ... you know, that I have now, I can depend on ...
L:  For -- for a million bucks.
R:  ... to have a million bucks and have a bunch of people that I have to watch my back with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, doesn't make any sense.
L:  I -- I mean, you know, like, [MN] the -- the part of having a best friend that money can't buy is that ... like if -- if you're in trouble, like, you went bankruptcy, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Your best friend will be the one to pick you up and take him to his home to live with him, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But if you have a million dollars, if you have a million dollars and something bad happens, you know, and that million dollars gone.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, bad business or something and that million dollars gone, I mean, then you have nothing, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean ...
R:  You have the streets.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's all you have.
L:  You have nothing.  [MN]
R:  You know, I have often -- I've often wondered when I've seen stories about homeless people and um they talk to them and -- and at one time they had a beautiful home and they had beautiful family and they had everything they wanted and then for some reason, you know, they lost everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But why are they on the street?  They must not have had good friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  Right.  It's really hard ... I mean, right now, I'm ... like ... like the one best friend I have is in San Diego.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I have a lot of friends around me but then each of them, there is something about them that that [MN] keeps them away from becoming my best friend, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Like --
R:  You don't really let them into you, right?  Inside of you?
L:  I mean, like, 'cause like -- 'cause like you see that they are not truthful to you.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  Like, some of -- like, how -- how many people do you think are gonna bend backwards for you in this world, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  It's not very many people and um ... like, my -- I mean, most of my friends are just competition, competitive, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Either like playing sport with me, basketball or in school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  Which is okay.  I mean, co- competitiveness is like the nature of -- of people, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But I don't mind that but because of -- of them being competitiveness, sometimes they being shady with you, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  As far as, like, sharing -- sharing stuff with you.
R:  Right.
L:  And so, I mean, it's really hard to find a ... to find a friend where he's not competitive with you, he's just out there a hundred percent to help you, you know and just, you know, if -- if you get something he's just happy, happy for you, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean, it's really hard.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's definitely worth -- worth a lot more.  So, you play basketball?
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  Oh, cool.  Who's your favorite team?
L:  Oh, Kings [LAUGH].
R:  The Kings, oh!
L:  Yeah.
R:  You [MN] you gonna watch the game on Thursday night?
L:  Oh --
R:  K-
