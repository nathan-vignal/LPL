L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Cindy[?].
R:  Hi, Cindy.  How you doing?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?
R:  I'm good.  My name's Ben.
L:  Ben?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Pleased to talk to you.
R:  Yeah, very good.
L:  Okay.
R:  This your first time too?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, me too.  I'm just like, all right.  So, affirmative action, huh?
L:  Yeah, I guess that's the topic.
R:  Ah.
L:  Um --
R:  I don't know too much about that. [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, [LAUGH] I think, um -- I think affirmative action is good in some areas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know -- you know, it all depends where -- wh- what -- what part of the country you're in.  You know, what -- like if you're in a big city, it probably does help.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  But in -- I live in a rural -- ah, small community.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, ah, I don't -- I don't think it would be a good idea around here.
R:  Not really necessary --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the smaller communities?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I agree.  I agree.  I don't know, I don't have a lot of input on what I don't know and can't speak of, so. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's the same -- same with me.  That's the only really opinion I have.
R:  [LAUGH] Definitely.
L:  What part of the country are you from?
R:  I -- I live in Utah.
L:  You're in -- oh, you're in Utah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Ohio?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I almost -- I almost went to college there.
L:  Oh, where at?
R:  Um, Whittenberg.
L:  Whitten- -- oh, it's a beautiful school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a beautiful school.
R:  Yeah, they give me a scholarship, so --
L:  I only live about twenty miles from there.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I live real close to Whittenberg.  Yeah.
R:  That's good.  Yeah, I live -- I live in Salt Lake City, so it's a bigger city.
L:  Salt Lake City.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a beautiful -- beautiful area through there.
R:  Yeah, I enjoy it a lot.  It's great fun.
L:  Are -- are you going to school there?
R:  Yeah, I go to the University of Utah.
L:  Oh!  Okay.
R:  They -- they gave me a full ride, so I just went there and --
L:  Wow, that's --
R:  Yeah.  So, it -- it's a good school.
L:  That's impressive.
R:  Yeah, I'm enjoying it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm glad for --
R:  It's a lot easier -- college is a lot easier when you don't have to pay for it, I've decided.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, definitely. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  So, how did you get into this study?
L:  Um, I had just, ah -- I -- I registered for it on the, ah -- I saw it on a -- a -- I gu- -- I guess it's a message board.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They, ah -- that -- that they were doing surveys like this and so I just signed up for it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's how --
R:  That's great.
L:  How -- did they -- was it through school that you signed up?
R:  Actually, my dad signed it up for me.  He was like, "You could use a little extra money".
L:  Sure.  I -- I do a --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, because -- yeah, I'm -- I've got to serve an LBS mission --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for the church and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we go for two years, so we have to get some funds together. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well you need to start taking more surveys.  Different kinds of surveys.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  There's quite a bit of money in it if you, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you -- if you, you know, check your email a lot.
R:  Yeah, I signed up -- well, really, that many?  No, I've signed up for twenty five of these.  So, I don't know, we'll see how many times they call me.
L:  Yeah, that's what I did too.
R:  But this is right in the middle of my work, because I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I do collections too.  And so like this -- I just got this call today.  I had to not do it yesterday, but I just walked out today.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We'll see if they get mad this time. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's your ten minute break.  Right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well that's what I'm just going to tell them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I needed to take one, so --
L:  Yeah.  They're, um --
R:  -- hopefully they'll be cool with that.
L:  Well, if -- do you h- -- I'm sure you have internet access at -- you live in a dorm --
R:  Yeah.  definitely.
L:  Well, you want to sign up for some, um, other, um, survey companies --
R:  Survey companies?
L:  -- to make -- to make extra money.  Oh, yeah.
R:  Really?
L:  A young college man like you?  Oh, yeah, you would get a lot of surveys and they pay between -- sometimes four, ten -- some of them -- some of them have the groups that you can go in any time you want --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- um, during the day and they'll pay you two -- up to two hundred dollars.
R:  No way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah, you need to --
R:  Do you just look up surveys on the internet or what do you do?
L:  Well, d- do you have an email address?  I'll email you.  I've got copies of them --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- that you could -- ones that you could sign up for.  Okay.
R:  Yeah. It -- it's higgy fifty eight.
L:  H.I.G.G.I.E.?
R:  H.I.G.G.Y.
L:  H.I.G.G.Y. fifty eight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Let me write this down, so I don't forget it.
R:  Yeah.  Thank you so much. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm getting -- I'm getting kind of old and forgetful.  Hey, anything to help a college student.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Thank you.  Yeah, it's H.I.G.G.Y. --
L:  H.I.G.G. -- H.I.G.G.Y. fifty eight.
R:  Five eight --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at MSN dot com.
L:  MSN?  Okay.
R:  Yeah, put on the -- on the response though, um --
L:  I'll post it surveys.
R:  -- survey buddy or something.  Yeah.
L:  I'll just put survey -- oh, "Surveys from Cindy" as a subject --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- okay?
R:  That would work, yeah -- I mean, because I just delete the junk mail.
L:  And -- yeah and my -- right and my email will be Cindy T. at bright dot net.  I'll send it right from my main -- main um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- instead of my Yahoo or something.
R:  Awesome, thank you very much.
L:  So, that way you'll see it.
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah, if you're -- especially if you're, um, going to be working with your church for two years, that extra money will come in very handy.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty cheap, but when you're not working and you're just doing church stuff for two years, it -- it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- money you don't really have.  So, I been -- I been saving it my whole life --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I -- I'm only around eight grand right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I need another two, so I'll be okay.
L:  And how -- how much longer do you have to earn that?
R:  I leave in two months actually.  I'm going to Brazil.
L:  Oh -- oh, you're going to -- oh, that's going to be wonderful for you.
R:  Yeah, I'm excited.  I got to learn to speak some Portuguese and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- get that going. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I just -- ah, there's a -- a fellow -- there's a boy from Sydney, Ohio --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's doing the same thing and going to Brazil --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- in just a couple of months.  Yeah.  And I live real close to there, I'm only --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- like fourteen miles from there and there was just an article in our paper about it.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  About him leaving.  Yes.
R:  That's neat.
L:  And it's for the Church of the Latter Day Saints, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] yes, that's who he's going with also.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  He might be in your group.  As a matter of fact, he's already been there once.  And he --
R:  He's already been to Brazil once?
L:  Yeah, he's a college student too --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he's going back for like -- for his two year thing now.
R:  Oh, his two year thing.
L:  Yeah, he's --
R:  Do you know what part of Brazil?  Because there's twenty seven nations in Brazil.
L:  Oh, he -- he's going to San Palo.
R:  Oh, he's going to San Palo?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's where the MTC is so I'll see him down there most likely.  What's his -- what's his name?
L:  I can't remember his name.  I didn't know his family.  I mean [several inaudible words] --
R:  I'd only -- I'd only know his last name if he went there, though.
L:  Yeah, I can't remember what it was and this is a small county and I usually know a lot of people around here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like I said, it's farming area --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I don't -- I can't remember his name now, it was just in the paper a few days ago.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Yeah.  Well, if you hear of anybody that's from Sydney, Ohio it would have to be him.
R:  Yeah, there's probably not too many, so.
L:  Because this is -- well --
R:  I'll keep my eyes out. [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's not a lot of ah -- of, um, ah, church -- Latter Day Saint church members around here.
R:  Uh-huh. [MN]
L:  Um, this is, um -- it's a -- it's -- there's a lot of, ah, protes- -- a lot of Catholic --
R:  Catholics, yeah.
L:  -- churches, um.  Luther and Methodist, ah, kind of gospel, you know, that -- so, there is not very many people that belong to that church.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, if you know one from Sydney it's got to be that one [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But it -- but the -- the townspeople are helping him earn money.
R:  Oh, gosh, that's neat.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, other churches and stuff are helping him --
R:  That's neat.
L:  -- helping him, so.  Yeah, it is.  It's really cool.  So, I guess we better start talking about affirmative action, um.
R:  Oh, yeah, affirmative action.
L:  I know absolutely nothing about affirmative action. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'm not into that whole affirmative action thing, so yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well I --
R:  They -- they said that, I'm like, "Oh, shoot.  What am -- yeah".
L:  Yeah, I had to stop and think about what it was for sure.  Isn't it when you, um -- you have to pick and select as far as across racial barriers for your -- for your company?  Isn't that what it is?
R:  I -- I -- I -- I honestly do not even know.
L:  I think that's it.
R:  Like I -- I thought it had something to do with, um -- like, um, war and stuff but then [several inaudible words] --
L:  No.
R:  -- didn't they say something about groceries or something?  I don't know.
L:  I think -- I -- I think affirmative action is like if you have a -- a place of business --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that you need to hire, um, a certain amount of, um, um, blacks, ah, you know, a urb- -- or whites --
R:  Oh, certain races and --
L:  -- you know, it depends on -- on [inaudible] --
R:  [several inaudible words] and stuff.
L:  Yeah, it all depends on how -- predominantly what your area is, whether -- you know, racially.
R:  Well, like -- like in Utah like there's not -- it's not a very -- it's mostly, the, um, caucasians --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so like I mean, Hispanics all like can get jobs here and stuff.  I don't think it's a huge problem in Utah.
L:  Yeah, it's not here either.
R:  But -- yeah, like -- but I -- I bet when it gets more Southern and the Southern States it's probably a bigger problem.
L:  Well, I think in the larger cit- cities is, that's why I said that at the beginning.  I think in the larger cities there --
R:  That's where they need to worry about it.
L:  -- is where it's very important, um, to even out the job situations.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, that -- that -- that was just my -- my -- really first impression of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of when he said that's what it was about.
R:  Well, it -- if it is over that, I mean, I know a lot of high school kids who can't get jobs because, um, older Hispan- -- older Hispanics have the jobs which high school kids would receive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so like I mean in that way it could be bad for a city -- big cities as well though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But like -- I mean, I don't think every sh- -- every -- it should go -- the job should go to the person who's better qualified.
L:  Qualified.  Exactly.  I agree with you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I agree with you.
R:  It -- it -- I don't think race should really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- race or sex should even come into play, but whoever's best qualified --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but with employers nowadays that's like the other thing they really look at --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is like what they look like and what not.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they're a good employer, they'll hire who's best and, I mean, I don't think it should be [inaudible] that they're a woman or a race.  It should just -- whoever's best qualified.
L:  Yeah, I think -- and that would be best interests to the person that's doing the hiring too, I would think. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  And -- and like you said about high school kids not being able to get jobs -- and, you know, because the older -- older Hispanics have those jobs, um, though don't you think maybe the older Hispanics have more experience than high school ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I mean, that's prob-  -- you know, that -- and so that is kind of a -- a good thing in a way --
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  -- you know, I sup- -- if you're at it from a -- the business end. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's true.  And like -- and they think they can pay the Hispanics cheaper, which the Hispanics usually do take for cheaper.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  But like that's the attitude, but I -- I don't know, the equal
