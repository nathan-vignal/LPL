L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Uh, I'm Michael.  Who am I speaking with? [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Elizabeth.  Hm.
L:  Hi, Elizabeth.  Uh --
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Oh, well, I was -- I've been contacted -- I live in the Los Angeles area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And you?
R:  I actually am from, like, central Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, it's --
R:  So, yeah, I went to school at U of I, Illinois, so --
L:  Oh, okay.  I was in Chicago last week, so ...
R:  Oh, really?  What were you there for?
L:  Uh, I have a brother in law that's in the -- at the, uh, University of Chicago, and so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- my wife wanted to visit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so we were out there for spring break.
R:  Okay, so, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess we're supposed to talk about current events and how we find out, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's -- I guess that's the topic they've picked.
R:  Good.  Uh, [LAUGH] well, it's funny because I was just thinking about that today as I -- I just got home from work [MN] and, uh, I was, uh, kinda watching the news or whatever, but I was a broadcast major.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah, so I am always, like, you know, trying to find out what's going on and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mostly just -- I listen to the radio a lot, but not only that but, um, I have my home page sent to -- set to, uh, CNN.
L:  Oh, y- -- I used to --
R:  So --
L:  -- check out CNN but now I'm -- I -- I like New York Times better.  I -- I just haven't -- I -- I tried --
R:  Really?
L:  -- CNN for a while, but I guess I wanted more, uh, anal- -- I like CNN and I do watch it s- sometimes.  I mean, I check the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- CNN website, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm kind of a New York Times fan myself. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't blame you.  They're very in depth.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The New York Times is pretty -- pretty infamous for that, but, yeah, I guess that's kinda why I like the -- the CNN or MSN dot com 'cause it's kinda like little blurbs, you know, you can kinda --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- get your little -- your little fill, but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I listen to the radio a lot, too, so --
L:  That's true, I do --
R:  Always.
L:  -- spend too much time.  What -- what do you listen to on the radio?  Do you have --
R:  Um, you know ...
L:  -- MPR or ...?
R:  Y- -- uh, I -- that -- actually that's funny, but I was a radio DJ and I hate MPR. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I get, uh [LAUGH] -- sadly, I know, it's bad, but, um, [MN] I just -- I get bored by that.  But, um, mostly just in the morning, um, whatever station I happen to be listening to.  I used to work at, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, like a, you know ... how would you describe it?  I worked at a radio group that had three very diverse stations --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm sure you've probably heard of Man Cal[?] in the morning?
L:  Who? [LAUGH]
R:  Have you heard of Man Cal?  He's kind of like the Chicago version of --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- Howard Stern.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't listen to that station --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so much, but we have that one and, of course, they all carry a little bit of news.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But the one station I listen to, um, [MN] they do a lot of local stuff, but then also they update every -- every morning, you know, three or four times an hour on the latest war --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what's going on over there, so, yeah, it's -- but then, you know, you go all day and then I'm at work and then I don't have an opportunity at work to, you know, hear what's going on, so then it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wait till you get home, sort of thing.  But, yeah --
L:  I'm always connected to the internet somehow, so I usually get my news from the internet.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, I get -- check out New York Times.  Uh, I do check out CNN.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I'm trying to think if I check out any other news sources.  Every once in a while I read some online journals and stuff like y- -- a lot of the magazines.  I think I checked out foreign policy, it's a website.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I haven't done very recently.  I ki- -- I do tend towards the -- the more in depth coverage just 'cause [SIGH] I guess I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess I'm in academics and so usually --
R:  Okay.
L:  Usually I -- I --
R:  Are you -- do you work at a university?
L:  Um, yeah, I do.  Um, I'm a Spanish teacher.  So, I'm in linguistics, but I --
R:  Oh, you're kidding me?
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm in --
R:  That's funny.
L:  So --
R:  That -- that was my minor when I was in class, so ...
L:  Really?  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's a --
R:  Now --
L:  I stuck with it and -- but, uh, I guess, like, it gives me access to computers all the time, so I -- I can --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- check [inaudible].
R:  Now, what level do you teach at?
L:  Um, I teach college level.  I mean, right now I'm a student, I'm in grad school, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, I just teach one class and then I take a bunch of classes, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's where I'm at right now.
R:  Right.
L:  I've got a long [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Long way to go.
L:  -- a long ways to go, but, yeah, I'm just, uh --
R:  Oh, that's okay.
L:  -- first year into the program.
R:  Now, do you guys -- I mean, 'cause I'm kind of out of touch since I've graduated or whatever, but what is, um -- [LIPSMACK] what's kinda the standpoint of the campus that you're at right now?
L:  Well, um, I -- I'm at USC right now.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I used to be at B- BYU, and BYU is a very conservative school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's, um -- then going to USC is a much more liberal school.
R:  Right.
L:  Around here, um, USC is -- is probably f- -- at least within my department, it's -- are -- are you talking in the context of war right now?
R:  Right.
L:  Like, what their stand- -- I'd say it was pretty much, uh, anti war.  Most of the people that are in the department, there are very few Americans.
R:  Right.
L:  They're primarily Europeans and actually a fair number of, uh, of Turks and so [LAUGH] --
R:  Really?
L:  Uh, yeah, they're, uh, Turks and, uh, large group from, uh, South Korea.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, yeah, they --
R:  Are they outspoken on their opinion of America or are they kinda ...?
L:  Um, [SIGH] not Amer- -- you know, I've only rec- -- I received some emails from a couple of people where they have, uh, petitions that they -- they want signed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, to, um, just say, "Sign on.  We're academics against war" and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, things like that.  So, but usually the topic doesn't come up much, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in -- I -- I don't know.  I guess it -- it is really multi national, the department.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, we do have a lot of Chinese people from --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, [MN] m- -- we actually figured it out that I think it -- the -- the -- a big group there is -- is actually Korean, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  That's been kinda, yeah, the attitude around here.
R:  Now, what's your -- how's the campus newspaper?  I mean, do you feel like the students are informed or ...?
L:  You know, [SIGH] it's hard to --
R:  How do they cover it?
L:  -- consider if anyone's -- I do -- I do pick up the -- the student newspaper.  Um, in general, uh, I'd say there are -- there have been a few articles, uh, uh, by conservatives that have been printed, a few editorials.
R:  Really?
L:  And I read those, um --
R:  Now, is the -- you -- is the newspaper there, like -- like, I know the one here at U of I, um, it's independent, so it's not owned by the University.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it's very -- it's very -- I guess you could say it's the opposite of that.  I mean, it's very liberal, like, very -- I don't know.  I'd say neutral actually.
L:  Well, no, I was gonna say that they -- they have two newspapers that you pick up on campus.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They have, uh, like, a newspaper that's kind of your a- -- non official newspaper, I guess.  We call that one the Trojan Horse, um, at USC.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that one is -- is really quite liberal and the regular newspaper is just liberal. [LAUGH] So ...
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's -- I -- that's -- that's the way it strikes me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in just having picked it up, that it's -- it's a lib- --
R:  So, you don't feel like the -- the university, like, inflicts on their journalism in any way, then?
L:  Uh, I think it -- just being in Southern California, I've just noticed listening to the radio around here that it tends to be -- well, see, that's the thing is about my perspective, is that coming from BYU everything looks [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, that's true.  I can see that.
L:  So, it's -- it's kinda colored.  But actually, I guess Southern California does have that reputation for -- for being liberal.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [SIGH] uh, yeah, I'd say [SIGH] like, uh, the main radio stations I've heard around here, MPR and then Radio Pacifica, which is beyond that in, uh, being liberal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh --
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I'd say pretty much the -- the coverage is fairly -- fairly liberal, although the -- the student -- the student newspaper has pr- put, uh, a few editorials that, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- were kind of more pro war.  I -- I haven't --
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't pick it up very often, though.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, are -- now, you say that you're at work.  Uh, where do -- where do you work at?
R:  No, actually, um, well, I just got off work.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, um, since I graduated I'm kind of the, uh, the in between stages, trying to find, like, the good job and, you know.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, right now, actually, I'm just -- I manage one of the stores, um, at the mall.  I do --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- oversee, like, the marketing --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for one of the stores, so it's --
L:  Are you trying to work your way back into journalism or ...?
R:  Mm, yeah.  Um, my first job, actually, out of college, um, I worked there for, like, four months.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, they decided that, um, there was no more budget to pay my position, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- there goes my job.  And so I've been kind of floating along, you know, just trying to figure out how to get back into it and things like that.  But it's just a really -- the hardest thing about working in journalism is it's a tough business anyway, like competitive wise, to get into, and then just the way that the market is right now is just -- I'm sure as you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not the greatest --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- time for anybody.
L:  No.
R:  So, it's like two big strikes against me, so I'm hoping that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I -- I'm constantly, like, checking out what's going on --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, reading papers and -- and, uh --
L:  So, are you looking f- --
R:  -- looking online.
L:  [NOISE] So, are you looking --
R:  What was that?
L:  -- for more of a career in, um -- [MN] do you wanna be in the press and broadcast media?
R:  Well, here's -- my thing is, um, I love -- love reporting, don't get me wrong --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but there's -- I actually was reporting, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was working at a TV station on September eleventh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It was -- it was probably the worst day in reporting ever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it was like -- for me it was almost like a -- a true eye opener because it was just so sad.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And it's like for a lot of reporters, I mean, they took it as, "Oh, like, this is the biggest story of my career and, you know, I'm gonna make it now and I'm gonna put together this great package" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it was like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when I got to work the very first thing I did was -- I mean, I got to work at, like, ten thirty our time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so things had just happened.  Um, and the very first thing I did was pull feeds from, you know, CNN and ABC and NBC.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, all of the major networks.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And make, like, a collage of what was going on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it was -- it was sad and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so I just kind of [SIGH]
