R:  Hi.  I'm Rhonda.
L:  I'm Julie.
R:  Uh ... uh, what is wrong with the school system, um ... I'm not a parent but I feel that as ... as someone who has been in the school system, I -- I think that there needs to be more uh parental involvement in the school systems.
L:  Uh, I am a parent and I have three teenagers and um I'm not very involved in the school system insofar as I don't go to uh parent teacher meetings.  Um, I do check regularly that my kids have done their homework but i- in general [MN] and this is um something I've thought a lot about lately, I feel like um ... Americans don't understand what a bargain they're getting in [MN] -- in public education, that it's, you know, basically funded by property taxes, we -- we pay a very small percentage of our income uh towards our children's education whereas in other countries, they are paying a much, much higher percentage of their income, either directly by paying fees or um through taxes as well and I think that the quality of our education really suffers because we're just not uh ... we're not paying our teachers enough, we're not um -- kids aren't in school enough days during the year and uh supplies and resources are severely lacking in a lot of schools, so that's --
R:  Mhm.  Oh, I agree and uh, you know, when I was uh growing up, um ... within it seemed like every two or three weeks, we had half a day off because, you know, the teachers were having some type of instructional uh thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that -- that really uh bothers me because I'm wondering, okay, where is my, you know, where are children's educations going to?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I agree.
R:  Um ... uh-huh ... uh, now, I personally don't think uh schools should start until after Labor Day but here they have 'em starting before Labor Day and then you automatically uh get the, you know, whole weekend off.  You get a long weekend.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... and like you said, every ... it seems like every two or three weeks, at least here in um the uh metro Detroit school system, uh I'm in the music[?] system ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, we're -- you know, they're -- they're having a day off um ... not for parent teacher conferences ...
L:  Right.
R:  Uh but this is, you know, for, you know, enrichment uh of -- for the teachers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, I don't know exactly what is being taught uh or if it's, you know, something, you know, well, yeah, if it interests me, I would -- would attend but, you know, I -- I don't know what work is really being done uh in these uh in service training and uh ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... and so, like, [SIGH] you know, are they goofing off or whatever and at what expense to our children.
L:  Yeah.  Now, I -- I used to be on the other side of it and I was teaching in the public schools and I remember those in service meetings and um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the most part, they were a waste of time although i- if you have the right kind of um supervisor who carefully plans these kinds of um depa- departmental meetings, um, so that you're with your -- your colleagues in your field, it can be kind of refreshing and rejuvenating to be together to kind of bounce new ideas off and you can kind of go back into your classroom with a few more tricks up your sleeve.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That was ... that was useful.  When we were made to sit in front of speeches by uh school administrators or videos about the latest technique in, you know, teaching learning disabled kids, it wasn't always uh geared directly towards what we needed so it was hard to feel an- -- like you were getting any benefit from it.
R:  Oh --
L:  So ... 
R:  As a --
L:  ... I think ... go ahead.
R:  As a ... as a teacher, do you feel that maybe more hands on training would have been better than to sit and listen to someone?
L:  Oh definitely.  One -- one thing that we've done in our department recently, for example, is we've um had teachers um actually go and visit the classrooms of other teachers who are in the same level.  I teach English as a second language.  Teaching at the same level um ... even maybe co teaching for a little while uh and -- and it was made possible by the two salaried people who are on staff going and -- and subbing in -- in the classes of those teachers so that they were free to then go on.  Our teachers found that much more helpful than going to a staff meeting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It just -- it was very hands on.  It was right in the classroom and it really made a difference in um ... in the -- in the use of time for that particular teacher.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In -- in terms of the public schools, I don't know whether um most teachers find those in service meetings useful at all.  In fact, when I was there, it didn't seem like it at all and the -- and meanwhile, the kids are home.  They're chatting on the internet, they're not doing their research projects, they're not, you know, really engaged um academically at all and they lose a lot of time.  I feel like my kids learn in one year, what other kids in other countries learn in half a year.
R:  [COUGH] Oh yeah.
L:  It just -- we waste so much time and uh ... and I really, really am sort of discouraged with my own kids' lack of what I consider an adequate education.
R:  Oh.  Well, I -- I can understand uh your -- your point of view, um ... because, you know, like you said, you know, the kids don't spend enough time uh ... granted, I don't like to see kids, you know, bogged down with so much homework and stuff ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... um or have to constantly depend upon the parents ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... but um yeah -- yes, they -- they should be uh learning uh more uh ... I -- I think, some of this stuff should be more optional than uh ... uh required um, although I think there should be more emphasis in -- in certain subjects [MN] for all children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not just [MN] gender, you know, related.  Um ... I personally do not believe that um Spanish needs to be taught in elementary school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh ... I think uh, you know, if you come to America and you live here, you need to learn the language and why should we uh cater to you?  Other countries don't cater to us if we're there for any length of time.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  If anything, if any language m- my -- I would want my child or any child to learn, would be American sign language.
L:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I feel that there is something -- more and more people are becoming um hearing disabled --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if not completely losing their hearing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that is something I'd rather see my children doing.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Or -- or my niece and nephew.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh [LAUGH].
L:  Well --
R:  Yes, I'm very American [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm [MN] ... yeah, and I just noticed that in -- in my travels, that in -- in countries where teachers are well paid, there is just a higher standard that they hold themselves to, the teachers a- are generally brighter and more well educated in a -- in a sort of roundabout sense as well as in their specific field.  You attract a higher caliber -- higher caliber of person to the teaching field if you can offer um some kind of competitive pay.  We are often, in our schools, we are getting people who just barely got out of college, uh and just barely squeaked into a teaching um program and some of them are practically right out of high -- I mean, they're twenty two years old and they're already being thrown in the classrooms where they've got a hundred and fifty kids to deal with a day.  I think it's ridiculous.  I think we should be um training teachers t- to get their masters degrees, getting -- recruiting people who are truly interested in their fields and -- and t- -- and teaching as well.  I think that -- that the biggest um influence that teachers had on my life were those from um t- teachers who were really excited about what they were doing and who weren't burnt out, weren't feeling put upon, weren't feeling really taken advantage of and being paid under -- severely underpaid when you log in all the hours they spend at home correcting papers et cetera, et cetera.  Um, it's really kind of a shame.  It's -- it's an embarrassment to -- to our country that weren't not um rewarding our educators um i- in -- in a way that really reflects their ability and -- and the -- the work that they're doing.
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  It is -- you know, and why should teachers have to pay out their own money to purchase supplies ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... and other items ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... [MN] that are really needed in the classroom.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh ... a- and the- they waste so much.  I mean, we're -- we're in the middle, it seems, of -- of a big scandal uh in the Detroit public schools ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... uh in regards to those things.  Um uh the uh administrators, I'm not talking about the teachers but the administrators who um abuse the, you know, uh travel allowance and stuff like that, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or -- or use a um uh uh school owned charge card to -- to make purchases that aren't even related.
L:  Right.  Right.  No, there is that.  There is accountability with the administrators.  Yeah, we have way overpaid administrators in our district too and -- and teachers are -- are underpaid.  It's really um I think, contributing to the general d- decline of, you know, equality ...
R:  Mhm.  Uh-huh.
L:  ... of the education that kids are getting.
R:  Well, yeah, yeah and that -- and that's another thing, you know, I -- I feel that teachers should be rewarded ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... uh when they -- when they do uh well.  I believe they do need to be reprimanded uh, you know, and not you know, like, okay, you're -- you're a -- you would have to really do something real serious to me to be fired immediately.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... but uh I -- I feel that if -- if parents were more involved and I'm not talking at the elementary school level.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm talking junior high, senior high school ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... uh I don't think ...
