L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  How're ya doing?
R:  Good. My name's Natalie.
L:  What was it?
R:  Natalie.
L:  Natalie?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay.  Mine is Gentry.
R:  Gentry?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.
L:  [COUGH] How are you doing today?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  All right [LAUGH].
R:  Great.  Where are you calling from?
L:  Uh, Oregon.
R:  Oh, so am I.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, Washington, across the border.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Okay.  Well um ... boy, this is going to be a good one 'cause you're a guy [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um ... I would, although I could really use the million dollars, um, would have to say no.  I would not uh ... I would not take the million dollars [NOISE].
L:  Well, why not?
R:  Why not?  Um ... it's a female thing.
L:  You gotta have some reasons [MN].
R:  Uh w- [LAUGH].
L:  [COUGH]
R:  B- best friends are hard to find and wh- -- if you have -- if -- if you have a best friend, um, that'd be tough to do for a million.  That means you would never, ever be able to share your life or what's going on in your life or, you know, things together again.
L:  Well, haven't you had a lot of good friends that you have, like, moved away from ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  ... you know, that uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that uh, you probably never communicated with again?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah but I can't -- can't uh the ones that I have, I can't say that I -- they weren't -- I mean, they were not what I would call a good friend.
L:  Uh-huh.  This is --
R:  You know?
L:  -- best --
R:  I mean, I've -- I've got a best friend in California but I wouldn't even consider her a best friend but we're good friends.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we still communicate.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, um ...
L:  But if you ...
R:  Yeah, that'd be -- that's tough.
L:  It is, yeah, I know.
R:  Yeah 'cause like I said, I -- I could really use that -- that million dollars right now.
L:  That'd go a long way, wouldn't it? [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it sure would but I don't think I -- I don't think I could hold up my -- my part of the bargain, you know?
L:  Uh, [MN] ... I got -- my dog's barking up a storm here.
R:  Oh is that it?  I got my daughter barking [LAUGH] up a storm! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, okay.  Um ...
R:  So, what about you?
L:  Um ... well, I read the uh, the question the other day when I was looking through them and I thought uh, well, let's see, I think I would probably accept the [LAUGH] million dollars.
R:  Yeah, yeah?
L:  Um ... uh, like I said before, I guess uh ... uh ... well, I shouldn't say money is more important than good friends, you know --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- but I think I could probably find some other good friends.  This said best friends.  I believe that was the way it was worded.
R:  Y- -- right.  It definitely said best friend.
L:  Yeah [COUGH].
R:  So ...
L:  And may- maybe I feel that way because I don't really have any best friends, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's ... yeah, if I didn't have this best --
L:  I have a lot of good friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  But -- but not a -- a particularly good friend, a best friend.
R:  Best friend.
L:  But um ... um, maybe if I did have, maybe I'd feel different about it.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm not sure, you know.  It's an interesting um ... interesting thought, though, you know.
R:  Yeah, it is, it definitely is.
L:  But if --
R:  I mean, I -- I -- I could say, yeah, I'll take the million dollars, however I doubt it, I'd be able to hold up my bargain and not talk to that -- my best friend.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd -- I --
L:  Well, it -- it didn't say you would have to give it back or [LAUGH] ...
R:  [MN] Yeah, it didn't -- want it back or something [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  There's another one -- another question like that, if um, would -- would you take a million dollars to leave the United States and never come back.  You know, but that's a -- that's a -- whole other ...
R:  Well, see, that'd be -- for me, it would be easier to answer.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think so.
R:  That -- that'd be -- I hope I get that topic.
L:  I'd go to New Zealand, you know.
R:  Well, see I'm -- I'm not from the United States --
L:  Oh, aren't you?
R:  -- so for me, it's -- so for me it would be e- easy to d- -- answer that one.
L:  You could go home, yes.
R:  I'd be going home, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, where's that?
R:  Well, I can't say that.  I consider the United States as my home but I was uh born in uh France.
L:  Oh, were you?  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so ... all my family's back there.
L:  Oui!
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly [LAUGH].
L:  [COUGH] Um ...
R:  So ... but [MN]
L:  I'm -- I'm getting to talking to about this with my wife and I don't uh ... no, she never really gave me an answer, whether she thought it would be uh, you know, she would take the million dollars or not.
R:  I -- I bet you, it's a big -- it'll be a -- it'll end up being a big gender -- a gender thing.
L:  I bet it will be too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause women tend to --
L:  'Cause -- more --
R:  -- you know how we are?  We -- you know how we are with our -- with our friendships?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean ...
L:  [COUGH]
R:  ... so ...
L:  Uh, yeah.  Men ... men kind of say, okay, I'm -- you know, I can always um get some new friends, you know?
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  Yeah, I'll take the million dollars, you bet on it.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  In a heartbeat, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know my husband would.
L:  See you later, Fred [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, exactly [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R: [LAUGH] But see m- --
L:  Go find ano- -- go find another best friend [MN].
R:  Yeah.  See, but for some reason, for females, it's different.
L:  Oh, it is.
R:  You know, it's --
L:  There's a -- there's a basic difference there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ... do you ever listen to Doctor Laura?
R:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].  I --
L:  [MN] and she talks about that a lot, you know?  The -- some of the basic differences between men and women and -- and uh, that's probably right along in it, you know?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like, really -- you know, it's -- for women it's really hard to find someone you can really, you know, talk your guts out and say a lot of things that you probably wouldn't even ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  ... you know, of course, I can say anything to my husband.  I don't hide anything but some women out there do, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's -- it's different.
R:  Yeah.  It's a whole different relationship.
L:  You bet.
R:  So ... 
L:  And that's the way it should be [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I mean it's -- I think it's healthy.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.
R:  It's -- it's a healthy thing but so --
L:  But you say your best friend is uh, in California?
R:  Well, I -- the one in California [MN] she's a good friend.  My best friend is uh a neighbor down the -- down the street here.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  We're -- we're um, pre- pretty much consider her family.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  So, um ...
L:  And you wouldn't give her up?
R:  No, I don't think so 'cause it's taken me a long time to find someone like that.
L:  How 'bout two million [LAUGH]?
R:  Oh, man [LAUGH] geez!
L:  [LAUGH] See, there must be a point there where ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  ... where you'd [NOISE] have a different feeling about it?
R:  Have ... yeah.
L:  Five million?
R:  Uh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know, yeah.  I mean, well, they didn't specifically say that if I did end up talking to her, would I have to give it back.
L:  Yeah, well, you'd -- you'd assume that you probably would have to or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Oh god, I don't know.  That's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll tell you one thing.  I'll be asking her that in the morning.
L:  Ten million? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh yeah, definitely for ten million.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Ten million?  Heck, yeah.  I mean, where does a m- -- where does a million take you nowadays?  No --
L:  Yeah, I knew -- I knew ... I -- I kn- -- I knew you had a price!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We women always have a price [LAUGH]!
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know [LAUGH].
R:  Um ...
L:  [MN]
R:  You know [MN] --
L:  Eight minutes --
R:  I mean liter- -- I mean, really, [MN] how far will a million get ya, you know, nowadays?
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  I mean uh, it'll get you, I guess, some places, you know?  It'll -- it'll definitely make you happy but ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... if you invest it right and all that but ...
L:  Yeah if ... well ... let's see, if you invested it and got ten percent um, you'd have a hundred and twenty thousand dollars to live on a year.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And not even touch the -- your principal.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.
L:  And you can do that.
R:  Yeah, I could do that.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] No problem.
L:  That's about four times what -- what you're making now, probably.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, right now, I'm making zilch 'cause I'm taking care of three kids, so ...
L:  Oh, are you, oh?
R:  Um ... but yeah, I agree.  I totally agree.
L:  How did you happen to hear about this program?
R:  Oh, through um ... uh ... money shopping dotcom.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Money and shopping dotcom.
L:  Are you a shopper?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's how I got on it.
L:  Me -- me too.  We do uh ... my wife and I do merchandising.
R:  Oh, you do?  I'm trying to get into that more, a little bit more, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Um ... I'll tell ya, what you might do.  Uh um ... go to Lantis ... L.A.N.T.I.S. merchandising dotcom.
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
L:  And uh, see if they have any openings uh in this -- in your area.
R:  In this area?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I'm right across the river from you.  I'm in Vancouver.
L:  Um, the gal who's in charge of that, her name is um Maria ... what's her last name?  [NOISE] no, Maria ... I can't remember her last name.
R:  You can't?  Oh.
L:  I don't have her card right handy but she is uh the uh, kind of the director in this area.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And she's in Vancouver.
R:  Oh, okay.

L:  Yeah.
R:  My first one.
L:  Yeah.  Eight minutes is a long time, isn't it [LAUGH]?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I thought it was ten minutes but --
L:  Yeah, well they said --
R:  Are you timing it?
L:  No.  They said that it's supposed to be uh [NOISE] supposed to be a total of uh [NOISE] ...
R:  They'll say, like, what, eight minutes and they tell you when it's over or ...?
L:  Yeah.  I think so.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But um ... I don't know, I suppose we'd better get on -- back on the subject.  I'm not -- I'm not sure what um ... what else we can say about it.
R:  Yeah, I know [LAUGH].
L:  Uh ...
R:  Uh ... let's see ... mm ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  There's not too much left to say.  I think we both pretty much said it all.
