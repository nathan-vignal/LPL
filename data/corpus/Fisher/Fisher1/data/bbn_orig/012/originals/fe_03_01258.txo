R:  Hello?
L:  Hello --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my name is John Webber[?].
R:  My name is Angela Williams[?].  How you doing?
L:  Oh, just fine.
R:  Fine.  So, the last time you went to the movies, did you go or did you stay at home?
L:  Oh, I stay- -- I stayed at home.
R:  Me too.  What was the last movie you saw?
L:  Well, the very, very last movie, ah, okay you won't believe this, Bueller Ferris' Day Off --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for about the hundredth time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think the last one I saw was Signs.  Have you seen that one?
L:  Which one sorry?
R:  With Mel Gibson?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-uh.
L:  Oh, really.  Uh-huh.  No, I haven't seen that one.
R:  Oh, well that's a good one.  It's about aliens, so. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah plenty of them -- those around.
R:  [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, they say.  Well, the -- it had those -- have you seen the advertisement for it?
L:  Ah, yes I -- I believe I did.
R:  Don't those crop circles really exist though?  That -- because those are in the movie, but don't they really have those in -- in real life?
L:  Ah, I've seen, ah, people try to drum up business for their small towns doing that.  Ah, I don't really know --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  But ah, I mean if I were a small town and I'd like you to come visit and, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- visit my shops, that -- that would be a good way rather than opening up a Walmart which probably noone would come anyway because it's too small. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I thought I'd seen something on TV --
L:  Th- -- yeah.  Yeah --
R:  -- one time just saying that -- that they really existed.
L:  -- there were -- you never of that -- that angle did you?
R:  No, I --
L:  [several inaudible words] small town -- small town America everybody's friendly and then somebody pops and, you know, it's -- you know, they realise, "Hey we have to help this community.  You know, there's no taxation, we need visitors" and um ...
R:  And so you think they make things up, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what would you do if you had to maintain as a, um -- a, ah, tourist area?  I mean, you would want -- ah, [several inaudible words] people to come to you somehow.  You would try anything --
R:  Build a -- build a Disneyland. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and so maybe -- maybe -- may- -- maybe even a few aliens from outer space, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But you understand what I'm saying, that it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- i- it's not just -- not just some -- or -- visitors from outside another planet.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  [several inaudible words] the whole idea that -- ah, the emotions would carry people away.  It is, ah, quite -- quite amazing.
R:  [inaudible] -- oh yeah, because people want to believe that, you know, there's extra terrestrial life somewhere --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, they'd probably go.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They'd go just to try to see the whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you want to call it.  Whatever they're trying to say that they have.
L:  Right.  Because [inaudible] -- beyond -- beyond they don't feel adequate with what's around them, they say -- oh, you know, the war time.  Now, that's the reason we're going to movies is to kind of escape from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- quote, unquote, reality but not realising in the reality of the movies is there, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But do you use --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do you usually just watch your movies at home or do you like going to the theatre?
L:  Yeah, just basically at home.  It's --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- it's ah ...
R:  I have digital cable, so sometimes I'll order the pay per view things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and watch those movies. [LAUGH] I don't like getting them out much.
L:  Ah, I -- a lot of the, um, ah, movies have been w- with a lot of commercialism lately I noticed.  I mean, they just -- of course, it's been that way for several years, but ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- you know, amazing piece of work.  I -- I know in Chicago they put some things on the stage to -- ah, on the movie and it was quite an accomplishment.  I mean, whether I agreed with the screen play or not, ah, it doesn't matter.  I think -- you know, I -- I'd probably like to wa- -- or see that, ah, but --
R:  What was it?
L:  Ah, Chicago.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know --
L:  Have you heard of Chicago?
R:  I don't think so.
L:  It's -- ah --
R:  Was it --
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's a movie just -- just, ah, coming out, ah, with, ah, Catherine Zeta Jones and, um, [NOISE] and ah, who? [NOISE] Renee Zellweger and, um -- oh, who's that guy, that -- that -- [several inaudible words] but I can't -- I -- I can't even stand him. [LAUGH] Married, ah, um -- [MN] oh, I can't remember his name. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They, ah -- you know, they -- a lot of hard work in that movie and, ah, it -- it actually paid off for them and, ah --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- yeah and -- and plays -- pl- -- and people don't realise how -- how hard, you know, and -- [several inaudible words] Broadway plays --
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lot of work in that and all of them didn't know how to sing or dance really, so.  It -- you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [several inaudible words] be able to do that and encourage, you know, others to do that.  I mean, it's quite an amazing feat.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean -- well -- well, you know, Sound Of Music, wow.  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when you think of a musical, I mean it's -- it's, ah, just to cut all the political and everything that -- it's terrible now in Hollywood you -- in -- in movies you see a figure and -- and you think of now a polit- -- you don't -- you don't see bias or neutralness, you see a political -- ah, a bias --
R:  Oh, yeah.  They all -- they represent something.
L:  -- everywhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah and it's just awful and, ah -- you know, I -- it's hard to watch a lot of the movies, um, because of that.  You know, like [several inaudible words] and ah -- ah, Ro- -- Robin, ah -- ah -- ah, Wilson or whatever his name is.  I mean, I [NOISE] -- Williams. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah -- and, um, Robin Hood or he thinks he's Robin Hood.  Ah, let's see who else --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, um, [MN] and, ah -- ah, you know, all of them.  It's just totally sad.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just trying to think of [SIGH] -- you know, the liberal -- the liberal thinking has really permeated most of the media and most of our thinking.  Ah, it's -- it's really gone too far that, ah --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- just recently a new book came out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- by, ah, [several inaudible words] I don't if you've hea- -- you get that radio station down your way called Savage Nation, Michael Savage?
R:  No.
L:  Ah, he -- very interesting, he's on the number one show [several inaudible words] very conservative --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, but he really speaks out about this, how the -- ah, they don't know what they've done.  Ah, it -- it -- it -- the lawyers have controlled every aspect -- or even the movies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just terrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, we used to -- it used to be -- it used to be [several inaudible words] illegal and everything they do is a legal issue. [LAUGH] And human rights versus, ah, constitutional rights became a, ah, issue of [several inaudible words] and it's like sh- -- it's hard.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, wh- -- [several inaudible words] you think about it, because our whole nation was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- based on -- on, ah -- on human rights, ah, and put into a constitution but -- but somehow these two are at -- at war with each other. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- ah, it'd make an interesting movie too, ah, don't you think?
R:  Where -- ah, you must be from up north?
L:  I'm -- I'm in California.
R:  In California.
L:  Yes and you must be ...?  What --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you said you were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in Alabama?
R:  Arkansas.
L:  Arkan- Arkansas.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, not too far from Texas.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's -- Lit- -- Little -- Little Rock?
R:  That's where I am.  Yup.
L:  Oh, right.  I have some friends out there.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yup.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you all --
L:  I don't if they -- I don't know if they watch movies --
R:  You all get all the -- you all get everything first.  You all are the trend setting state, so it's probably why I hadn't heard of the movie you were talking about it.
L:  Which one?
R:  We'll probably get it in another year.  Chicago. [LAUGH]
L:  What -- oh, Chicago.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah -- yeah, it's going to be -- it'll probably win all the Academy Awards.  It's already won most of the, ah, Grammy's. [NOISE] It's a -- and it's -- it's a -- it's quite a work., ah -- but ah, you know, Gram- -- I mean, Oscars come out Sunday, so a lot of -- you know, the fine work -- the fine work th- that was done, it probably was buried under all the -- ah, accolades for that movie and, ah, that's too bad because it is so -- it was so -- there were quite a few good w- works [several inaudible words] The Piano -- The Pianist, I think that movie -- ah, I know who the director is -- well, actually I met him. [LAUGH]
R:  The Pianist?
L:  [inaudible] Polanksy, I don't know if you've heard of him?
R:  No.
L:  Hello?
R:  I'm here. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, he wa- -- yeah, I've met him.  He's a, um -- um, he wasn't a very good [NOISE] director of certain movies, but [LAUGH] I did- -- which I never watch, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but ah this -- ah, this I think should give him a lot of credit but I don't -- I don't know if they'll even give him an honorable mention.
R:  What was the name of that one, you said?
L:  The Pianist.
R:  Hadn't heard of that either.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, the -- and that was a -- a really good work, ah [NOISE].  There --
R:  When did that come out?
L:  Ah, a couple of months ago --
R:  We must be really far behind.
L:  -- I think.
R:  Yeah.  Well, what movies are you s- -- or seen out there?
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well I can't even think of any right now
