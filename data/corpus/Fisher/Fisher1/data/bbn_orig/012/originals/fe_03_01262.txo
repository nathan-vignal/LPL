R:  Hi, my name's Annette[?].
L:  Hi, Annette.  I'm Laurence[?].
R:  Hi, Laurence. [SIGH]
L:  Do you like movies?
R:  Yep, I do.  Um, a lot of times I prefer to rent though.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yeah, I guess it just depends on how much money you got too, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, [LAUGH] often times [LAUGH] [SIGH] --
L:  Or if you have someone -- someone good to go with or something.
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] Often times I shell out all that money and then it's a horrible movie.  I feel a lot better if I only paid three bucks or something. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, there you go.  You ever had to walk out of one?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yup. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we just -- my family and I, we just got back from one.
R:  What did you go see?
L:  We went and saw -- gee what's -- just trying to remember the name of it.  It's the one with the -- ah, Two Weeks Notice.
R:  Oh.  How was it?
L:  With -- have you seen that one?
R:  N- no.
L:  Sandr- -- with Sandra Bullock and --
R:  No.
L:  -- and, um, Hugh Grant.  Ah, I've -- I've always enjoyed, um -- ah, well I've always liked -- I always like most of the shows that, ah, Sarah -- ah Sandra Bullock's in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and Hugh Grant, you know?
R:  Yeah, me too.  I like her, although I also like Hugh Grant.
L:  The one that I really like -- what's the one that was over in England where -- with, ah, Julia Roberts?
R:  Julia Roberts.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  What was that one?
R:  N- -- I think it was Notting Hill.
L:  Yeah, Notting Hill, that's it. [LAUGH] Anyway, this is pretty -- it's a good pretty good show, you'll really enjoy it.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  But we -- last night when we have had three girls that play competition soccer and, ah, one of them had a indoor soccer, ah, game last night, so we really couldn't make the movie so we went and rented a couple of them.  So, we went and rented.  So, it just -- like I said, for convenience purpose --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- lots of times, that's the way to go.
R:  Well, especially being parents and the -- well, you know, most of the movies you can't take the kids to, so ...
L:  [NOISE] The one we went to, it was, um, a dollar movie.
R:  Oh, even better!
L:  Yeah, that's what it makes it nice.  Ah, they have -- now, where do you live?
R:  In San Diego.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm up here in Salt Lake City.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, ah, and also it -- you know, make a big deal -- big difference in what the weather's like and stuff too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, whether you're going to rent something or brave -- up here -- up here in Salt Lake, you know, [NOISE] brave the winter or whatever to go out. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I know. [LAUGH] You guys get the weather up there.
L:  Yup, once in awhile we do.  But today it was -- yeah, it was really nice [NOISE] -- really nice.  But like last night, as I say, the girls said, "Well, you know, if we can't -- can't go to a movie or whatever, you know, let's rent -- ah, let's rent a movie and stuff", so.  And being [NOISE] -- we have six children and --
R:  Wowie.
L:  -- so it, ah -- so, normally when we go to a full pay [NOISE] movie it's got -- we do it, ah -- [NOISE] on Christmas Eve --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's a tradition.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- and then we go to one that we really like or something then, but other than that we normally wait until they, you know, hit -- hit the dollar movies, just cause --
R:  Oh, sure.  Yeah.
L:  -- it's so expensive.  Now, do you buy -- when you go, do you buy popcorn and drinks?
R:  Um, I break the law and sneak in, um, candy bars. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, do ya? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we -- we just -- we figure for a dol- -- since we're going to a dollar movie we can splurge for --
R:  Well, it's not a dollar here, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  I know, that's why I said --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's just here.  That's why we [several inaudible words] splurge, but even then sometimes we'll [SIGH] -- we'll sneak in a drink or popcorn -- well, no we don't sneak in popcorn but we'll sneak in candy and stuff, you know?
R:  There used to be a movie theatre that, um, for five dollars they would let you bring in whatever kind of food you wanted.  I mean, you bring in a lobster dinner if you wanted, you know, [LAUGH] and sit there and eat it.
L:  Wow.
R:  The- they didn't care as long as you paid em the five dollars you could bring in as much as you want. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I guess that's the way drive ins still are.  Do you have drive ins down there anymore?
R:  A couple.  Yeah, they're -- they're kind of dinosaurs.
L:  They've kind of gone out of style, haven't they?
R:  Yeah, they're dying off. [LAUGH] But ...
L:  Yeah.  So, do you -- when you rent, do you get, ah, cassettes -- ah, do you use V- VHS or do you use DVD? [NOISE]
R:  I don't have DVD yet.  I'm behind the times, so. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we just got one -- our son bought one for us for Christmas, so.  But I guess we've been behind times for a long time but -- how many VCRs do you have?
R:  Oh, let's see.  More than we have TVs right now, so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think we have like four working ones and a couple of others sitting around. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're like us. [NOISE] I'm just trying to think, we've got, ah, one --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- two -- yeah, we got -- we got two single ones and we have one that's a combination, you know, TV VCR that you can take on -- ah, take on trips and stuff.  It's a little nine inch one.  A combo, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when we take -- when we take trips like down to San Diego or -- I have a sister that lives in Palm Springs, but we like to go visit San Diego and go, ah -- and up the coast to the beach.  But it's -- now, instead of how many hours it's how many movies does it take to go see. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  So, we rent -- oh man, yeah w- -- but I bet we have a vid- -- ah, VHS collection.  I bet we have, ah -- oh, probably  a hundred and fifty, hundred and eighty VHS tapes.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I don't even know how many we have.  There's boxes and boxes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean -- and I think a lot of people do that, it's really something.  So, if -- lots of times, you know, we put two and three movies on one -- you know, on one o- -- one tape and so I don't even want to guess how many movies we must have down there, but --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- we have a really good collection of Disney. [LAUGH] We have a -- oh, we have a whole bunch of original Disney movies and stuff that -- well, that we've collected, ah, over the last fifteen years, I bet. 
R:  Oh, yeah, so do we. [LAUGH] Pocahontas and Lion King. [LAUGH]
L:  Yup, yup, same here.
R:  Beauty And The Beast. [LAUGH]
L:  Now they're going to be coming really handy because my sisters -- ah, I mean, my -- my wife's sister had twins last year --
R:  Oh, wow --
L:  -- twin boys last summer --
R:  -- she is going to be busy.
L:  -- and she had a two year old already --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and so he is -- he just loves Disney movies and stuff and so -- ah, you know, movies.  So he -- they're always coming up and borrowing, you know, [several inaudible words] give him something new to watch because they get tired -- because he just sits down and watches them over and over. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] gets the -- almost gets them memorized.  Hello?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.
L:  Oh, you're still there.
R:  I'm sorry.  It sounds like I'm disappearing because the computer keeps calling me even though I'm already online. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you kidding me?
R:  It -- no, it's beeping through on the call waiting.  I -- I tried to shut off the call waiting but I guess it didn't work. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's interesting because I -- I mean I have -- I didn't know -- I -- I haven't turned off my call waiting either but -- so you're getting it on your side then huh?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, the same computer is calling me.
L:  Oh -- oh, because you can see the number --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- that's why you know?
R:  Yeah, I have caller ID, so. [MN]
L:  Oh, you got caller ID.  Well, we've been at least eight minutes, I wonder how long you're supposed to talk.
R:  Um, ten minutes.
L:  Ten minutes?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, how long have you -- have -- is this your first call?
R:  This is my first call.  My husband just did one right before this, like ten minutes before this.
L:  Oh, really --
R:  And that was --
L:  -- and who did he talk to?  Where did they live?
R:  Um -- ah, I'm not sure.  I wasn't in the room or anything, some -- some lady.  I don't know.
L:  Wow, that's amazing.
R:  She apparently lived somewhere remote like we do.  Even though we're in San Diego we're kind of out in the desert part, the country part of it, so we don't have a school, we don't have a gas station.  We have to drive twenty minutes to get the kids to the school [LAUGH] in the next town. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  How many children do you have?
R:  I have three.
L:  And what's the range in ages?
R:  Oh, one's only seven months and then I have a seven year old and a nine year old [LAUGH], so. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  Well, that's exciting.  Ours, you know, range from twenty to ten.
R:  Wowie.
L:  So, every two years to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right now -- right now it's really cool.  It's ten, twelve, fourteen -- no, not quite fourteen, she turns fourteen next week, but she'll be fourteen and then I have a sixteen, an eighteen and twenty year old.
R:  Wow.
L:  But ah --
R:  Busy, busy, I bet. [LAUGH]
L:  -- pretty soon -- pretty soon we'll be down to only four --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I have -- well, we're down to five right now.  I have one that's serving a -- a mission for the Mormon Church in Chicago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for our church.
R:  Cool.
L:  And then I have another -- and then my second son is going to Brazil in May, so.
R:  Wow.
L:  But they all love movies.  I mean, it's amazing they -- um, we've -- we've just grown up -- you know, the family growing up, we've just really enjoyed, ah -- watch a movie.  And it -- it is, it's a -- it's a -- an inexpensive form of entertainment, especially you know if -- as I say, if you rent videos and stuff it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we've had to clip -- you know, clip coupons and look for good deals, you know --
R:  Oh, sure.  Yeah, here to. [LAUGH]
L:  -- rent one, get one free and all that, you know, but ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But if you don't have school or stuff there, how far do you have to go -- I mean, does your -- just your -- if you don't have a grocery store and stuff, where do you have to go to rent movies?
R:  Like, half hour.
L:  Half hour away?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  And so it takes that far to go get a -- go to a movie theatre anyway then, right?
R:  Yeah, e- exactly.  Yeah --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- the video store is right next to the movie theatre and so ... [LAUGH]
L:  And so how long have you lived there?
R:  Um, since ninety seven.
L:  Ninety seven.  Where'd you come before -- where'd you live before that?
R:  Oh, just another part of San Diego.  I wa- -- I'm a native here, so. [LAUGH]
L:  What about your hubby?
R:  Um, yeah he lived in Bonita.  He's been in San Diego for a long time, he's -- um, he lived in Idaho I guess that's where he grew up mostly, even though he was born in Santa Rosa, so.
L:  Where did he grow up in Idaho?
R:  [MN] American Falls and like here, it's a small place. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my word.  I'm -- I just live twenty minutes from him -- I did.
R:  Wow! [LAUGH]
L:  Where I grew up -- I grew up in Black -- tell him I grew up Blackford.
R:  Blackford?  Okay, I will. [LAUGH]
