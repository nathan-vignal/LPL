L:  Hi, I'm Francie[?] Wheland[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Marilyn[?] Nunn [?].
L:  Hi, Marilyn, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Do you want to go first?
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm new at this.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  Oh, no I've been doing it a couple of days now.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um.  Yes, I think there's something seriously wrong with the public school system, the pu- -- um, I'm a single parent and I have to spend a third of my income to put my daughter through a private school because of the public school system was so bad, so horrible, that I feared for my daughter's well being while in the school system and we are in a good school district.  What can be done about it?  God only knows.  I have no idea.  Um, how about paying the administrators less, having fewer of them, maybe if they care more about their jobs and they care more about kids and paying the teachers a little more?  I don't -- I -- other than that, I don't know what else to do.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Your turn.
R:  Well -- okay, my turn.  Um, well, I -- I put my children through a public school because where I came from the public school offered them the better education.  Um, I'll guess it's going to make a difference where we grow up in or when we raise our children.  I also am a single parent.  I raised three children, sent them all the way through the public school.
L:  Where do you live that the public's?
R:  Um, I live in a -- a small town in North West Iowa.  And you're from?
L:  Ooh, I'm in Texas.
R:  In a large town?
L:  Austin?
R:  Okay.
L:  Actually, I -- I'm in a twenty -- a town of twenty thousand people, Cedar Park.
R:  Okay.  And I don't even have two thousand people in my town. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  So -- so, I'm --
L:  So, your schools just sounds good then.  You don't --
R:  Right.  Our school system was wonderful for my kids.  I say that -- I -- I was a single parent like I said and -- and if I wasn't available after school my boys helped the janitor and he'd see to it they'd get home.
L:  Wow.
R:  I mean -- and -- and they had a great education.  They were --
L:  How many students per class?
R:  Um, well my boys graduated -- my -- my middle son had his largest class -- the largest class in their school and there was a hundred and --
R:  [SIGH]
R: -- twenty that graduated.
L:  Wow.  That sounds wonderful.
R:  So.  My daughter didn't even have a hundred kids in her class and to me that was a big class because --
L:  Oh, well see there you have it, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- the personal attention.
R:  Right, they got the individual attention --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The teachers could see they were having trouble, the teachers gave their all from them.  So --
L:  Well, my problem is my daughter is very gifted --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the public school systems here were overcrowded.  So, what they do is they cater to the -- the mediocre children and the children that are falling through the cracks.  And the gifted kids are bored to tears and don't do well and they're -- you know, it's just all crammed in.  And my daughter's won national awards for science, um, for stem cell research papers, so she's not -- it's not like sh- --
R:  No.
L:  And she'd always done well until she went to this high school that was overcrowded.  That had, you know, forty children per teacher.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]
L:  In the class -- there was over fifteen hundred children at this high school.
R:  Wow.
L:  They had to have portables out in the back, so it was really, really bad.
R:  So, now -- now the question we're supposed to decide here, you know, is it the school or the area they live in?
L:  Well, you know --
R:  You know, the public schools they got enough teachers to get the, you know --
L:  [several inaudible words].  Right.  Exactly.  I guess it depends on the size of the city.
R:  Right.  Because our public schools -- like in middle school they have a programme for the honor students and, you know, they have -- they have parents who come in and work with them.
L:  Well, we have that h- -- we have that here too, but it gets to the point where -- well, see Texas is really bad.  First of all, I would never recommend anybody move to Texas. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not moving there.
L:  Yeah, if you're -- if you're not, ah -- well, see it's a very re- -- we're in the bible belt up here --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and people are very religious, so most of their children go to school in religious schools anyway.  But um the public school system is pretty much just a babysitter for the poor or the people who don't care.
R:  Okay.
L:  Whereas in Phoenix where my daughter went to school -- my daughter went to a school in a really good school system grade one through five that was second in the nation as far as academics.  And she did real well, she loved it, it wasn't too full, it was very nice.  But one school district over had the worst district in the nation! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I don't know what that means.  Is it the people who are running it, I mean, the superintendents?  Where does it start?
R:  It -- I would -- I'm going to have to go along with the administration.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  You know, are they there because they care about the kids?
L:  And then that attitude just rolls all the way down the aisle.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because if the administration doesn't back you up.  See, I -- I did teach for a couple of years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, lower elementary many, um --
L:  Oh, wow.  Great.
R:  -- twenty, thirty years ago and, you know, I had a wonderful school.  Everybody cared how was my classroom going --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, how were things going.  I was the new teacher on the block and we had all kinds of help --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  But everybody cared about the kids, you know?
L:  What -- were you in public?
R:  I was in a private school when I started.
L:  Oh, private.  Okay.  Okay.
R:  So -- but I went to a public school, raised my kids in a public school.
L:  Right.
R:  I had the choice and that was my choice.  In my area, that was the better choice.
L:  Well, the public school here they lost my kid and tried to convince me that my straight A, honor roll student had run away --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- when actually there was an assembly that everybody in the office, all the way from the receptionist to the principal, conveniently forgot simultaneously.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, so I was none too happy and that was the final straw for me.  And I can't really afford to put my daughter through private school, but quite frankly I can't afford not to at this point.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, the one thing I really like about this private school, there's only nine kids in ninth grade and they're all very close.  Teachers are very good, they don't make a lot of money but they're very concerned about the kids.  My daughter has made friends with them, they made friend- -- she goes to this -- there's -- there's this one little girl who's from [inaudible] and she has bible study and she's having a hard time with the bible because, you know, speaks in the King's English instead of regular --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and she had the hard enough time with the English language as it is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I went on the internet and I found a -- a [inaudible] bible and my daughter took it to school and gave it to her to help her out. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And n- -- now she's doing much better.
L:  Yeah, she's doing much better.
R:  But no th- they care -- I can see that where private school kids care more -- they get more as a group, a very small room.
L:  Is it -- do you think it's because they get more money?  Oh, the air raid sirens over Baghdad.
R:  The teachers?  They what?
L:  Air raid sirens over Baghdad [inaudible] --
R:  I heard that about five minutes ago, already.  So --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- depends on which channel you're watching.
L:  Yeah.
R:  ABC had it on first.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  ABC just had it on.
L:  Yeah, I'm on Fox.
R:  Oh.  Oh, that's a little behind ABC yet, so.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bye bye,
L:  Wow.  Okay.
R:  I haven't heard that we're doing anything, but that's not our subject, right?  Okay.
L:  Oh, no I'm sorry.  Okay.  So, any way ...
R:  So, what you -- how many -- how many kids do you have in school?
L:  Ah, just the one.
R:  Just one?
L:  Just the one.  But I --
R:  See now -- and in --
L:  -- I went through public school system too and the school system that I went to the year that I graduated they produced the most, um, illiterate children in the nation, that year.
R:  Mm.
L:  Isn't that wonderful?  I'm so proud.
R:  Uh-huh.  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just what you wanted to be a class of, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I was really proud to hear that.  So, I thought, "Oh, thank you.  Yes, yes, yes".
R:  Well -- well, see all three of mine are now going to college.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  But out of that, two of them chose private colleges.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  One went to a state university.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, they all went to the same high school, you know, but I say that out of those two they went to the private school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they grew up with the small classes and everything --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- they would never have made it at a state university.  The one that chose to he was the outgoing kid, he could make it, you know, and he did.
L:  Right.
R:  But they're all in college.  Well, my daughter's bounced around three or four different ones, she doesn't know what she wants to do.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- I -- I don't know what her problem is some days. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  The private schools -- well, you know, hey [LAUGH] they get used to smaller classes.  I think that's better.
R:  Right.
L:  And I can see the state -- state uni- -- the universities being harder for them.
R:  Mhm.  But yet I'm -- I'm close to people who have their children in the private schools here and some of those kids make it at the state universities and become honor students.
L:  Well, you -- yeah, but your public school is like a private school. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] Well, you should see how small our private schools are here then.
L:  May -- maybe I should move to a smaller --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- a smaller town, maybe I'd do better.
R:  Ah, it's a possibility, you know, if you can find them -- see our -- a -- as my kids were growing up, two of the school districts joined together, the public school districts, to make one.  And I said it was harder on us parents who grew up and we were rivals forever.
L:  Right.
R:  Instead all our students are all in the same boat and they say, "Okay, you guys are going to get along now".  You know, there is -- there's no more rivalry, the town's three miles apart and we don't argue with each other anymore.  [LAUGH] We all get --
L:  That's wonderful though.
R:  The kids did great.  The parents from time to time still have problems.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, the parents are always the worst though, aren't they?
R:  Yeah, but -- you know, but I said, "My kids had opportunities I know they would not have had".
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  In a bigger school?
R:  Right.  So.
L:  Well, great.  Well, thank you so much.  I enjoyed talking to you and I'm sure we'll talk again.
R:  Okay.
L:  You're going to love doing this.  Some people are really short and they -- they only answer as briefly as they can and it lasts less than sixty seconds.  So.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But you can last any amount of time you want.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, this is your first one?
R:  This is my first call.
L:  Well, enjoy.  Because they -- they have some really good questions. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
R:  You just accept everything that comes up? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I do, if I'm here.
R:  Yeah.  So.
L:  You know, some of them are interesting.  So, you don't have to.
R:  Yeah.  No, I -- I haven't been home quite a few of the times, so.
L:  Oh --
R:  And then earlier my -- I'm having my house redone and they worked with my telephone cables today and they plugged the wrong phone into the wrong cable.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have two lines.  One for the internet.
L:  Right.
R:  So, my phone's ringing upstairs and I thought, "What, somebody leave a cellphone here?".
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  And I had to go
