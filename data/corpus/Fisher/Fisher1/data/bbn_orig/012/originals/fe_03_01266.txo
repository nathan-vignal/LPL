R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where are you -- where are you at right now?

R:  -- the -- My Fat Greek Wedding.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] that was a long time ago.
R:  But I -- I rented.
L:  Oh, you rented it.
R:  I rented like, ah, few days ago.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  So -- yeah.
L:  Did you like it?
R:  Yeah, I love going to a theatre, but since I, you know, had a baby then, um, we --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- yeah, we haven- -- yeah, I haven't gone to, ah, see a movie.  We just rent --
L:  How old's your baby?
R:  She's two now.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, she's older, but you don't -- you don't get babysitters?
R:  Yeah, we haven't done that.  We just rent it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then it's easier that way.
L:  It is much easier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't rented a movie for awhile, but the last movie I saw in the theatre was Chicago.
R:  Oh!
L:  That's a good movie.
R:  Really?  I want to watch that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I think some movies it's better to watch it at the theatre, it's -- it has that impact of the loud sound and, you know?
L:  Yeah, because it's so huge -- yeah and it's huge --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I love it.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But some of them, ah, I think, ah, renting a movie is good enough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and a TV screen.
L:  Yeah, action movies are better when they're big screens --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I think.  But yeah some movies, like My Big Fat Greek Wedding was probably just fine at home.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, it was.  It was, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's a cute movie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cute movie about love.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Oh, I -- I hear your baby girl.
R:  Yeah, she's laughing. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, what are your, ah, favorite, ah, movie, like, categories that you usually choose? [NOISE]
L:  Hm, I like foreign films a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I like mys- -- like murder movies. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Like su- suspense?
L:  Yeah, I love those kind of movies.  I don- -- um, romance is okay, comedy is okay --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I like most movies, but really my favorite is suspense type, like mur- -- someone dies and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know like --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- Murder By Numbers, those kind of movies where they have to find out who killed them.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I love those too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, like mystery movies and then --
R:  Yeah, mystery movies.
L:  -- I do -- I like a lot of foreign movies, like Emma Lee[?], did you see that?
R:  No.
L:  Emma Lee.
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  The movie -- it -- it's a French movie --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about a little girl who does all these good things for people.
R:  Oh, have you been wa- -- how often do you watch?
L:  Movies?
R:  Ah, go to a theatre.  Uh-huh.
L:  Hm.  I try and go oft- -- my boyfriend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is in another country right now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but when he was here we went a lot and we rented movies a lot more.  But now that he's gone I'm working harder at -- because I'm trying to write a thesis for a -- a graduate degree --
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and so I find that now that he's gone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he'll be back this week but he's been gone for quite a few months and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- since he's been gone I haven't -- I've been going -- I've gone to a couple of movies but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't rent movies, because I don't like to watch movies at home alone.
R:  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, before we had a -- um, we had our baby --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we used to watch a lot of movies, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we al- -- you know, we were pretty caught up with what's out there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then now we're very behind. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We haven't watched a lot of movies.
L:  I think that happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See it's probably not as important anymore.
R:  Yeah, but we -- we still love it.  I -- I still love movies, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, the ones that I really liked a long time ago was like The Firm type of movies too.
L:  Oh, yeah I know it.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, the ones that you have to figure out.
L:  The Fir- -- yeah, that's the same what I was thinking. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I love those kind of movies.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, me too.
L:  I don't think I've seen The Firm though.
R:  Really?  Tom Cruise one?
L:  I don't think I saw that one.  Mm mm.
R:  Yeah?
L:  I -- I liked the -- like the John Grisham movies --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- from the books.  Yeah, those are good.
R:  Yeah, I like his too.  Yeah.
L:  What else -- what other kind of movies do you like?
R:  Um, I like romantic comedy too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, ah, Pretty -- Meg -- Meg Ryan and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those, ah, pretty light -- light, romantic comedy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those are -- you know, those I like too.  And then suspense and then I [LAUGH] -- well, I -- I like action too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one of those -- ah, what is it, um -- um --
L:  Die Hard?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I watched all those. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, the ones that I don't like to watch in, you know -- is, ah, horror movies.
L:  Horror.  Yeah, I --
R:  Yeah, I don't like those.
L:  -- I like some if they're not too scary.  But if they're too scary --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just close my eyes the whole time, so it's no point in watching it.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Because I'm a baby, I can't -- it would--
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't like it either.
L:  I wouldn't be able to sleep if I watch them.
R:  Oh, same here.  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, and then the most gory[?] movie that -- I don't -- I would never want to watch again [NOISE] --
L:  What?
R:  -- is, ah, Casino.
L:  Oh, yeah they killed everyone.
R:  Have you seen that?  Yeah, and the way they killed was so brutal that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I watched it on -- on, um, video --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but yeah, theatre would have been pretty bad I think for me.
L:  Oh, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I felt like it -- like, I remember a couple of years ago when these movies came out, I watched about three movies all at the same time that were all like the same kind of movie --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Snatch, Blow and Traffic.
R:  Oh --
L:  You know, those --
R:  --  that's a long time ago, huh?
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all three of those movies came out around the same time and Blow, Snatch --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and Traffic, they all seemed like the same movie over and over again.  Lots of drugs, lots of people dying or at least, you know, getting shot --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- it seemed like all the same movie.  But I remember I saw all three of those movies in like a span of two weeks and then --
R:  You did, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  -- I could- -- and I couldn't remember which movie happened to w- -- you know, what happened in which movie because they all just blended together.
R:  Uh-huh.  You know, at the theatre you can really get into the story and, you know, [several inaudible words] video too huh, even i- -- it -- even if it's a smaller screen --
L:  But sometimes with videos, like you can talk and you can do other things so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe you're not so attached to it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --
L:  I think the best movie ever on big screen was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah was Mi- -- ah, Mission Impossible.
R:  Oh!
L:  I loved that on the big screen.
R:  That was good, huh?
L:  Yeah, because you got to see everything huge.
R:  Yeah!
L:  I loved it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, those kind of movies I think --
L:  And the music was good.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The music, you have the sound system and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- theatre sound is different from home sound systems.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  I mean, the impact and the loudness and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, those movies, I think, a theatre --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is definitely more impactful.
L:  Sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did y- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- did -- um, did you ever see the -- what movie -- um, with the gir- -- oh, Charlie's Angels?
R:  No, I haven't.  Have you?
L:  Yes, it is such a cute movie, it's kind of like -- it's not -- it's not like -- it's like Mission Impossible but not as serious --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's really cute.  Like fun for girl- -- [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Oh, did you watch it at the theatre or ...?
L:  I watched it in -- I watched it at home and then my friend --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- gave me the DVD for Christmas. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  Yeah.
L:  So I have it and I wa- --  it's so cute. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, that's -- that's one thing that I want to watch --
L:  That's a good one.
R:  -- I guess now it's on DVD now.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- are they making a sequel to that?
L:  I think s- -- I heard that they were, I'm not sure.  I know that they are making sequels for Matrix, did you know that?
R:  Oh, no, I didn't know that.
L:  They did Matrix --
R:  Oh, I like The Matrix.
L:  -- and now they're going to do two more.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, they're going to do two Reloaded and Re -- something else with re in it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  They're going to do two more.
R:  Really, that will be fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I really liked Matrix too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- do you guys have -- in Irvine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you guys have a lot more movies come out mo- sooner or no, because I know in LA --
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  -- movies come out more -- no?
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't know either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know that sometimes movies come out a lot sooner in LA but I wonder if --
R:  Well, we're -- you know, in -- almost --
L:  Close?
R:  -- really close to LA --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- we're right next to LA --
L:  Well, then probably.
R:  Orange County, so ...
L:  Oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then probably you guys get movies sooner than we do.
R:  Really --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.

R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.

R:  Yeah -- yeah, you know --
L:  [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
R:  Have you ever been to IMAX.
L:  Yeah!
R:  Those are huge queues.
L:  With a -- with -- it's a round screen, is that what you mean?
R:  Um, IMAX is like a seven storey screen.  So, that's a movie theatre too but it's huge screen!
L:  But it's like round and it's like -- like three D. kind of, is that what it is?
R:  Oh, no they show that too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's not the three sixty screen.
L:  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
R:  It's just a really big screen.
L:  I don't know, maybe I have --
R:  You'd know it.
L:  I grew up in Los Vegas --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and in Los Vegas we have an IMAX theatre and I --
R:  They do.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- know I'd been to it, but I [inaudible]
