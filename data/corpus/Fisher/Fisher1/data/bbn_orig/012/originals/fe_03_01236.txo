L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, my name's Lois Hartman[?].
L:  My name is Georgine Aberatt[?].
R:  I live in a small town in Iowa.
L:  Iowa.  How's the weather?
R:  Actually, today it's pretty nice.  It's been, ah, cold and rainy [LAUGH] except for the sun's shown today.
L:  Good.  I live in Arcnord[?], California, which is sixty miles north of downtown Los Angeles.
R:  Cool.
L:  And --
R:  How's the weather been there?
L:  It's very sunny I went to Ventura, which is about ten miles, um, away, and the beach -- the ocean's beautiful.
R:  Oh, good. [LAUGH]  Have you had these calls before?
L:  No, um, I changed the time because I, um, had a time from ten till twelve at night --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was disruptive and I never did get anybody.  They, um -- I just would be on hold for a long time.
R:  I see.  Well, it's my first time, so.
L:  How'd you find out about this?
R:  On the internet.
L:  Me too.
R:  Um, a friend of mine is involved in market research and she suggested that I try some of this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  How does she -- um, does she bid on jobs or how is she, um ...?
R:  Yeah, she does.
L:  Well, I'd like to learn how to do that.  I worked, um, for market research companies as their employee and I -- I don't know how they, ah, get the jobs.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'd like to know that [several inaudible words] somebody.
R:  Um, I don't know if you're allowed to give me your email address, but I can --
L:  Sure.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's, ah, K.I.T.I., everything's lower case, at apple links dot net.
R:  Apple links dot net.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I work -- they've -- yeah, market research.
R:  Okay --
L:  yeah --
R:  I can email -- I can email you some information.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Um, so, our subject today is affirmative action in the workplace.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, my husband and I have our own business --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, we're a small employer and we, um -- I guess we're -- I'm glad that we are small enough that we do not have to have a certain percentage of any particular, ah, group.  Because I really feel that a person should be hired on their merit.
L:  What kind of, um, nationalities are -- you're in a small town in Iowa, what kind of e- nationalities are there -- what kind of ...?
R:  Well, ah, we have African American and Hispanic and that's pretty much the extent of it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and white.  Um, other than that we really don't have any other groups represented in any quantity. [LAUGH]  How about in your, um, company or ...?
L:  Well, in, um, Arcnord it's sixty five percent Spanish speaking people, of course California was part of Northern Mexico --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was partly -- it w- was Mexico at one time.
R:  Right.
L:  And let's see, where my mom is in Venice there are Cubans, El Salvadorians, um, Guatemalans, Filipinos, um people from Iraq and Iran.  All kinds of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  All kind -- people from the islands.  There's a l- big variety of people.
R:  Hm. [NOISE] So, how does that affect, um, I guess affirmative action?  Are you required to, um, just have a percentage of minority groups?
L:  No, I just, ah -- I like a variety of people.  Ah, I don't work -- have a company.  I don't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- work for -- I don't own a business at all and, ah, it -- the way I feel about it is I -- I'm sure that there's people in the past particularly, who were hired to fill a quota --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but -- and if you look at the big picture --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like -- like the big picture of the United States and the people who are Afro American we- were descended from slaves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, that unless you continually churn people and have an upwardly mobile that -- where it's possible to -- to go up economically --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you don't create a way for people to rise, you're going to have, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people with no stake in the United States at all.  No -- they'll be disenfranchised, they'll be disgruntled.  They won't have a investment in this country and they won't be participating.  They'll be stuck down in the bottom and it's easy, especially if you live in a big city, if you get broke anybody is -- a lot of people down here are riding around in big cars, big SUVs r- -- wearing new clothes, riding around looking like, um, they're doing very well and that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff is not paid for.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know?
R:  So, you feel -- so, you feel that affirmative action is the means of providing opportunities for people that otherwise wouldn't have them?
L:  Y- yeah and it's artificial, it was created legislatively, it's -- yeah, because um in -- especially in LA or any big city, you go up, you go down.  You can go up, you can go down and you're -- um, I work -- I did some volunteer work in a homeless shelter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Salvation Army with women and my deal was I was going to, um, school in Burbank to be a make up artist and I needed to practice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I practiced on my own, I prac- -- I didn't do anything but that class and I just practiced, practiced, practiced until it was second nature --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I could work on anybody's face who would sit still --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I got these -- um, I would call -- call around these different shelters for -- ah, people don't have any housing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and get people to sit for me and there was no difference between those people and anybody else.  The difference was that they didn't have a first and last -- because I b- -- I bet houses -- I bet houses -- what are houses priced at at your -- where you live?
R:  Oh, yes, the housing market here, um, is definitely, ah, less.  I mean, a house that sells here for maybe forty thousand, out there is probably two hundred thousand.
L:  There are no houses, um, in LA for two hundred thousand right now, I looked on the internet --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- in a realtor.  There's nothing that's -- maybe some foreclosure house in a red line area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but -- but I -- there's houses that are -- there's houses that are, um, -- um, maybe a million.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's houses in Venice that are functionally obsolete out of the seventies that are nine hundred thousand dollars and it isn't there, it's just a scraper.  So, it's very easy for people to -- um, particularly women to end up, um, out of a place to live.
R:  So, how does that, um ...?
L:  It's -- it's that there was no difference in people that I dealt with who were homeless than anybody else.
R:  Oh, no there's not, we're all good people.
L:  They were not separate, there was not some big, ah, issue that propelled them into the gutter.  I don't know about men, maybe they [inaudible]. [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  And, um -- but you know, I think everybody deserves a chance.  I know I've had --
R:  I do too.
L:  I've had chances.  I've -- I went to Texas one time, I went to Fort Worth and in about -- I -- I toured some historic houses and did what I wanted that day and I would have probably been invited to the w- junior league [inaudible] and you know it was because I was white and I looked a certain way.
R:  Mm.
L:  If I'd of been, um, a color or Hispanic, I would have been treated differently and I knew that.
R:  But I don't really think that affirmative action helps that, because um it's unfortunate that many times in an area of the country where there is not, um, a percentage of minorities or ethnic groups with qualified personnel to, ah, hire for specific jobs, people are hired that really don't have the qualifications to fill the job, they're only there because they fill the quota for that ethnic group or, um, for that minority.
L:  Yeah, that's not right.
R:  And I don't feel that that's right.  I feel that the employer ought to have the freedom to hire a person with qualifications.  I understand that -- how -- or why affirmative action was created and that was to, um, force people to look at equally qualified, ah, people and, you know, not discriminate against them because
