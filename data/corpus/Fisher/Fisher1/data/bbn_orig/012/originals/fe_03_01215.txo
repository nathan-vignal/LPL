R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Aletha Higgs[?].  I'm from Texas.
L:  And my name is Bridget Taylor and I'm from Chicago, Illinois.
R:  [SIGH] Okay, are we supposed to answer now? [LAUGH]
L:  Um ... I guess we're supposed to decide if there's a serious -- oh, I don't know.  Well, I'm in the Chicago public school system and I don't see anything as a serious problem.
R:  I don't see anything seriously wrong --
L:  I don't know if there is anything like that in Texas?
R:  Our -- uh -- our -- our -- our -- our schools are fine.  I'm -- I'm not -- I don't have any problem with -- with --
L:  The only -- I guess the only one thing -- issue to me, one concern, is when the students are -- if they don't show up for school, the parents probably should be contacted that your child is not in school today 'cause the -- you know, the parent could have sent the child to school and maybe they didn't show up.
R:  Right.  I agree.
L:  And then something should happen near the end of school when you go to pick 'em up or expect 'em to be at home and you know, don't know where they are.  All that whole day has gone by when something could have happened.
R:  Right.
L:  So, they don't have any kind of plan for that.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think that would be a lot better, you know [COUGH] 'cause my son goes to school every day but one day he should not be in school then I'd know something must be wrong.  They shouldn't just assume he's sick and we'll hear from him tomorrow.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah, right, instead of letting all that time go by.
L:  Exactly.  'Cause, you know, he gets on the school bus.  Sometimes I don't know if there is an attendant there, sometimes I can't stay there and wait for him to get on the school bus.  From there, the school bus, I don't know what could happen.
R:  Right.  Well, they -- they say, um, in our schools that they are supposed to call but they don't -- they don't always do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um --
L:  That's right.
R:  Uh, the only problem that -- that I can think of is that, I think security needs to be a little bit ... a little bit better, so that we don't have things happening like happened at Columbine.  I just --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I think that they should have metal detectors in a -- in a lot of the middle schools and uh ... and high schools, especially in -- in inner city areas.
L:  Mhm.  Right.  Well, yeah, some of 'em do.
R:  Yeah.  Some of 'em do.
L:  Some do but, right, not all of them do and I don't -- yeah, I mean, they could and I don't know what the kids might feel like, feeling like criminals going to school every day and um ... but it could be like at the airport.  It could be a ... um ... that's a good point 'cause you never know what your fellow [MN] classmate could be bringing to the school.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they might be mad at somebody and it might be one of the children.
R:  That's right.
L:  And not just somebody else coming in the building but that is so true and so many people do come in and out of school for whatever reason.  You know, if they do want to go to the office, just the fact that they made it into the school, you're right.  They could have anything and you don't know what -- what they may do.
R:  And I know that I've walked into the school many times.  Nobody's said a word to me.  I could have a gun, I could have ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... some, you know, weapon of some -- some sort.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, a -- a lot of people knew who I was when I -- when I would go in but um no -- you know, a lot of times, nobody would stop me, nobody would ask questions and I would see other uh parents there that, you know, y- you just never know, you just never know.
L:  Right 'cause each school is different and -- that's true because when I was working the polls, some of the polls were in schools.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I was doing a [several inaudible words] vote so I had to go in and deliver the [several inaudible words] votes to the polling places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know one school, there was some little kids before school started, waiting on the inside.  I just walked in.  There was no adult there whatsoever.  I walked through hallways looking to find where I'm supposed to deliver the polls and then when I went back the second time and had to go again, then it's a child telling me where to go.  I'm -- like, where are, you know, the teachers?
R:  [LAUGH] Who's in charge here?  [LAUGH]
L:  There were not even any teachers in the hallway.  There was -- and then when they saw me looking --  you're exactly right.  They weren't saying anything, like, can I help you or are you lost or what are you doing here, why are you talking to this child? [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's, you know, it's --
L:  I was like, I could have snatched those kids out of school and nobody would even know.
R:  Nobody would have known who you were or where they'd gone.
L:  I was pretty scared.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's scary to think that, you know, I've --
L:  [MN] Mhm.  Most schools are better than that but that one was pretty bad.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  'Cause I know my son's school, their security sits right up.  They only have door open.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's not even open.  You have to be buzzed in.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, at least, you know, they have a camera and they know who's coming in and the security sits right there.
R:  Oh, well, that's good.
L:  So, when you come in, he sees who's coming in, so they do have that but it -- like I say, each school is different but that particular school is, you know, I could walk in, there wasn't no lock and kids were walking around and I could snatch anybody I wanted to or go anywhere I wanted.  Nobody ... I could have, you know, [MN] um hung out in the school when they closed and nobody would have probably known.
R:  Yeah.  I -- yeah ... 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... I guess you just have to hope that that's not gonna happen but ever since um Columbine ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... and ever since nine eleven, you just don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  And now with the -- you know, with the war coming on, it -- it -- our -- our -- our children are the most vulnerable people.
L:  Right.
R:  And uh you know, I wouldn't put it past terrorists to -- to go in our schools and that -- that's what's scary.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So --
L:  And then the other problem is, I -- I don't know how it is there but I know in Chicago, there's no morning drop off.  You know, parents have to be to work before nine thirty.
R:  Right.
L:  And so, we really can't bring our kids -- 'cause my son's school starts at nine fifteen, we can't -- they're not allowed to get there before nine oclock.
R:  Really?
L:  Right and -- so, what are you supposed to do?  Now, I don't work right now but if I were to get a job where I had to be there at eight thirty, what could I do?  Then, I would have to try to depend on somebody else getting him to the bus stop and I really don't want to do that.
R:  Yeah, that sucks.
L:  So, that's when you can start running into a lot of different other problems.  Now, it's okay 'cause when he gets dropped off, he goes to after school programs around my house but in the morning, there's nowhere for him and the schools should have something for before and after.
R:  I think so too.
L:  You know?
R:  I think that would be good, then the [MN]
L:  And they have a lot of half days.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They have one -- one a month at least and maybe two a month.  What are the parents to do on those days when they get out at two uh noon?
R:  Yeah --
L:  We can't keep taking off of work.
R:  Yeah, you can't --
L:  Everybody doesn't have relatives or babysitters.
R:  And -- and -- and there are a lot of people who don't have babysitters or relatives and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, so -- so there needs to be something set up um through maybe government subsidies that would help people ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... who -- who do have that problem.
L:  Exactly.  And it's like they just threw this plan on us at the beginning of the year last year we -- it -- this is something new.  I mean, they had half days but now they have 'em almost every other week.
R:  Oh.
L:  And [COUGH] it seems like every time -- every time you turn around, they're out of school for whatever reason.  So, it's like, my goodness.  I gotta keep trying to find somebody to watch him or be here or it cuts into my work day, you know?  It cuts into my day.
R:  Right.
L:  But I need to be providing for the house or whatever.  I'm a single parent so it's really ... the school situation is getting worse as far as that's concerned.
R:  Right.
L:  And um ... they don't take it into account that we need uh advance notice.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH] They just give us a schedule, this is what's gonna happen.
R:  Oh, that's not --
L:  And it's like, oh my gosh [LAUGH].
R:  That's not good.
L:  Right.
R:  That is not good.
L:  And then our park[?] districts, you know, they don't work all the way with the schools when they're out.  They uh have -- they stop two weeks before school starts and they won't start until two weeks after school gets out.  So, you have two weeks or a week of what to do with your child and -- you know, so those kind of things are really, really hard because they want to keep the kids off the street but during the time that they are out of school, they don't have any kind of program for them to keep them off the streets.
R:  Well, I -- I hope that the government can uh, you know, I -- I -- I know that -- that they're working toward being um with that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh with subsidizing, you know, uh the -- the people who are -- who are having trouble with problems like that, so hopefully, you know, I guess we can just write to our representatives and try to get 'em to do something about it.
L:  Right.  'Cause maybe, you know, they can hire people to ... because they have a morning program to, you know, watch the kids, maybe a half hour or hour before school starts.
R:  Right.
L:  Because um, like, the private schools and Catholic schools, they pretty much have that ...
R:  Right.
L:  ... and I know they have that and still how they pay their employees so they need more money put into the public schools.  I think the teachers need to get paid more.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  That's -- that's a big problem.  Now, that's a serious problem.  I think if you're gonna be educating our future doctors or future presidents or future everything, then that money needs to go onto the people who's gonna be educating them and their -- your basic education is when they're young.
R:  I agree.
L:  Teachers need to be paid a lot more money.  
R:  A lot more.
L:  They go to school four years just like a lot of other people and they get minimum pay.
R:  And also, I think that the -- that the teachers would be um -- would be better and maybe better prepared if they -- if they did get paid more.
L:  Get paid more.  Exactly.
R:  And I think that they -- that they'd do a better job.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um ...
L:  'Cause in some --
R:  ... but I've -- I have a lot of friends.  I used to work in the school district and I have a lot of friends who quit being teachers because they weren't getting paid enough.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And they can make more um ... you know, working other places ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... and that's sad.
L:  That's very sad.  You know, right 'cause there's -- you know, you can't say they just go on for the pay check.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause it's not too [LAUGH] much.
R:  Uh no ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  ... [MN] because they -- you have to really want to be a teacher to -- to -- to teach.
L:  You really have to ... r- right.
R:  So, um ... it's a -- that is a problem but as far as the education, that uh ... my daughter has gotten uh in the -- in the schools here in Texas, she's gotten a -- a fine education for the public schools.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, I don't see that -- that private schools are any better.
L:  Right.  I believe um if ... you know, you can learn, if you apply yourself, you will learn and uh -- my son started out in Catholic school, he's in public school now, you know.  I wanted to wait 'til I got him in a -- in a school that -- of my choice which I did.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's a pretty good school and I like their program.
R:  Right.
L:  And um, one -- he had one teacher that was very good.  She communicated very well and not everybody has those skills but she was one who would call if something was wrong or if something was right.  She would call to [MN] ...
