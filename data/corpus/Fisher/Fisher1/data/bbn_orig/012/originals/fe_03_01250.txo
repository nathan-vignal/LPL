R:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Solarge[?].
L:  Hi, Solarge.  Um, my name is Candace[?].  Where are -- where are you from, Solarge?
R:  I'm in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm Ca- -- um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from, ah, California, Southern California --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- near Anaheim.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, ah, you know I got one of these the other night and we didn't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- talk long enough, but I -- I've since learned that they need to have eight minutes of recording --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  So, we just talk about, um --
L:  Affirmative action.
R:  -- what we think?
L:  Yeah.  I guess so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, do you want to start or I can start?
R:  Um, go ahead and start.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um.  Well, it seems like -- I don't remember when affirmative action got started, but it seems like it may have been as long ago as twenty five years, do you think?  And --
R:  I have no clue, because I'm only thirty one.
L:  Oh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well, then you probably had a insignificant amount of your life --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I -- I am fifty two and I think affirmative action came into play around the time I was in college.  So, ah, that might even be closer to thirty years even.  I would guess some time between twenty five and thirty years and at the time, I thought it was, ah, a reasonably good idea, because there definitely was a lot of, um, real blatant discrimination in the -- in the work force, particularly against, ah, certain groups, whether that was, ah, minorities or women and that -- it -- it -- y- you saw both, in terms of the kind of opportunities that were available for people, ah, and promotions and, ah, the -- ah, also the pay scales were, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- very unbalanced.
R:  Yeah.
R:  And so I think that, ah, all the years that there was affirmative action it was very useful to draw a lot of attention to the, ah -- ah, the differences between what was available for, ah, men and women and minorities and -- and, ah, main stream an- and it forced businesses, I think largely because of lawsuits that came about as a result, to really look at what they were doing.  [MN] Um, did it [SIGH] change things?  [LAUGH] I'm not sure it did. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, in California our state, ah, voted on legislature to eliminate affirmative action in, ah, state organizations.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, um, employers can still pursue affirmative action but it's not necessary for, ah, state contracting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so that was a really -- a big change and I think what had occurred over time is there was a lot of abuse of that.  Ah, the pendulum kind of swung the other way and in- instead of it -- affirmative action really working to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- help, ah, people get ahead, it ended up causing more resentment --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and people who, ah, actually were not equally qualified but less qualified were getting a push ahead, which was really, I don't think, the original intent.  The original intent, I think, was, ah, if they were [LAUGH] roughly, y- you know, pretty similar in qualifications that stronger consideration would be given to a candidate that in the past would have just been overlooked because of their gender or their race.  Ah --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- but it became very unbalanced, I think, in some instances.  So, anyway that's what I think. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, um, I think that as far as like people getting into colleges and things --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the hiring and all that, I don't think that they should, um, pick out -- you know, "Well, we have to have ten black people and ten Spanish people and --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ten white people".  I don't think it should be -- you know, that -- and I just -- I -- for -- also people with, you know, all the money can go to school --"
L:  Right.
R:  -- an- and I -- and I think that there's -- I mean, I'm -- I'm half French and half Chilean, so I can --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I can say [LAUGH] that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I do feel like a lot of the -- you know, the -- the Anglos --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- are getting pushed aside because, you know, this kid was Native American and --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- or a Hispanic an- --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I don't think it's fair, you know?
L:  No.  No, it -- it -- it isn't and, ah, I think that's -- I -- I -- I look and I think, "Well, this was a -- a social experiment, tried in our country to, kind of, even the scales" and it -- it got to the point and -- and even where it's still enforced, where instead of evening things up, maybe it did in part do that, but I think overall it caused more resentment --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and tremendously unfair systems --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it backfired.  Ah, I think it's a- an avenue to reduce discrimination, ah, people thought as not a fair thing, but a very unfair thing and there was a lot resentment and a lot of assumptions about, particularly minorities, but even women.  I worked in the corporate world for many, many years and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there were some assumptions made --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that we- -- you know, you got ahead because you are the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- affirmative action, you know, black --
R:  Poster -- poster child.
L:  -- female.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah and but for that, [LAUGH] you know, you wouldn't be ahead and -- and you got where you were be- -- not because you deserved it --
R:  Right.
L: -- not because you earned it.  And even though people wouldn't directly say it, you know, they were thinking it.  You know they were thinking it. [LAUGH]
R:  And they still do.
L:  Oh -- oh, absolutely.  I think that's --
R:  I mean, that's the thing.
L:  -- very true.  Very true.
R:  It's still -- it's -- I still -- I mean, I even feel it sometimes. [LAUGH] Like, I can't say I don't, you know?
L:  [MN] Uh-huh, as a woman you do?
R:  Um, or -- or just when I see certain things --
L:  Oh, you still wonder about it, if you see it?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like how did -- how did they get where they were?  Yeah, I --
R:  Oh, I mean --
L:  -- and I think still instead of there being this perception, "Well, they -- they had the proper background or experience [several inaudible words] doubt it".
R:  Well, what's that -- what's her -- what's Clinton's daughter's name?
L:  Chelsea.
R:  Chelsea --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- what's her new job?
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know what she's doing. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what she's doing, but she's making a hundred [inaudible] --
L:  I know she got a really good job, though. [MN]
R:  She's making a hundred grand a year, fresh out of college.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard that.  I read that.  I was astounded.  Like --
R:  I know.
L:  "Oh, my gosh.  What in the world?".  Does she -- did she come out of college and have that kind of, ah, leverage to do it?  I think -- is it consulting work she's doing?  I don't know [inaudible].
R:  I don't know.  I -- rolling cigars or something.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well -- she'll -- she'll [LAUGH] probably luck out like -- like dad --
R:  But yeah --
L:  -- she probably knows how to work the system. [MN]
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] But ah --
R:  But -- 
L:  -- ah, it -- it's really interesting, I did a lot of work when I, um, wa- was employed at my last job for eighteen years and we --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I got laid off -- just got laid off last year. [MN] Um --
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  I know, it was not good.  Although I was pretty burned out [MN] ah, but ah it -- yeah, it was pretty catastrophic, I mean when you don't know that you're going to have that happen.  Ah, but ah one of the things that I was responsible for doing was, um, government contracting and I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- definitely saw, in working on the government contracts, the abuses that would go on with affirmative action, where cities would have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so many stipulations or -- well, California eliminated it, but federal contracts that the public sector ended up paying far more and going with really, in some instances, very, ah, shaky --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- flaky companies, just because --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- they were minorities.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Just because and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they were the ones building the roads [MN] um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or, ah, doing certain kinds of business or infrastructure contracts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the only claim to fame they had was that it was a in quotes, um, minority or, ah, some --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some favored group and not because they should get the contract because of competence.  And, ah, so it was kind of like a combination of, was it affirm- you know, an affirmative action company combined with, you know, rock bottom pricing and, you know, you think of the taxpayer.  You know, businesses don't operate that way, the government -- it's stupid for the government to do that.
R:  I know, they do that here in Santa Fe a lot --
L:  Do they really?
R:  -- they do -- a lot of the -- the locals and the -- you know, the h- traditional Hispanic locals here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they -- it's like you just -- you just -- that's how they do things. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah and -- and then --
R:  You get in trouble if you don't. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and then the other thing that is disgusting, that I used to run into, is that [MN] -- is if the whole point is to give these, um, typically minority groups chan- -- or an opportunity, when you scratch below the surface and you find often it's a figure head that is put in there, or a -- a kind of a shell company and behind it is another organisation --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that has set it up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so it's just this -- kind of a weird, ah --
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
L:  -- [several inaudible words] yeah, game that is not re-
