R:  Hi.  My name is Jackie.
L:  Hi.  My name's Gabe[?]
R:  Well, that would -- that would be a hard one, I believe.  I um ... I don't believe I could do it.  [MN] what about you?
L:  I ... I don't think so either.  Yeah, I mean ... and especially now, I mean, if maybe ... you had some sort of disagreement or argument or something [LAUGH] then maybe the [several inaudible words] would be different but um ... a million dollars [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- friends -- friends are -- are hard to come by, it seems like [MN] any more because everybody goes different directions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when you have a -- a good friend, I just don't think there is any amount of money that could uh just throw that friendship away.
L:  No, not really.
R:  You know, they're uh ... they're there for ya whether you're having a good time or a bad time and [LAUGH] money eventually will run out.
L:  This is true [LAUGH].
R:  And [LAUGH] then what are you gonna have?  You're not gonna have your friend or your money.
L:  Right.
R:  I [MN] and besides, it's -- it's pretty lonesome spending money without your friend.
L:  Without uh yeah, without your [LAUGH] friend.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is not where I expected the -- the theme to go when the topic I heard [LAUGH] came up.  I thought maybe you'd be -- you'd get the money but then ... wow [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] They threw in that condition.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's pretty interesting.  I -- and it's -- probably there's a lot of people out there that would take the money and kiss off their good friends.
L:  Yeah ... I don't know.  That ... that's kinda sad [LAUGH].
R:  People are, you know, people -- people are -- are going at a fast pace now, it seems.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, what's -- what's this friend.  If I've got a million dollars I can ... a lot of 'em -- I mean, people think, you know, I don't need that friend.  I can just go buy some new friends.
L:  Yeah.  Uh ... I don't know [LAUGH] 'cause the people you meet after you have money may only be associating with you because you have the money and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  ... the people that were with you before are with you, you know ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  ... just 'cause [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I have -- I have a -- a couple of really good friends and there's just -- there's no way I'd tell 'em goodbye.  There's just no way.
L:  Yeah? [LAUGH] Can't talk to you any more.  I got the money.
R:  Yeah.  How ... oh boy.  That's ... that's just pretty awful [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think [LAUGH].
L:  I hope they wouldn't[?] say the same for me [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] yeah, exactly.  That's -- yeah.  I don't think so.  I -- a couple of my friends ... uh my -- my really truly close friends, I do- -- they wouldn't take the money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe acquaintances would but close, you know, true close friends ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... wouldn't uh wouldn't -- that's just uh ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, my kids on the other hand [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] If it was take the money or take the kids, I'd take the money.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The kids can go find another mum somewhere down the road [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  That'd be a way I could get rid of 'em in fact.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's awful.  Shame on me [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh dear.  That's uh ... Yeah, so what would you do with your money?
L:  Well, if I did take the money, I uh [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  ... I ... I don't know.  I probably wouldn't go and spend it all in one shot or anything because being a student, you know, I always incur a lot of costs and uh bills come my way so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'd probably just parcel[?] it out and save the rest.  
R:  Pay all your student loans off.
L:  I don't know.  I really ... yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That would take care of a lot of that right away [LAUGH].
R:  You know, that's -- I mean, that's -- that's interesting that, here you are in a position to actually use the money ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  ... for the good of your, you know, schooling ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... and yet you choose to take your friend instead.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's cool.  That's cool.
L:  Well, presumably the friend would last longer [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And do more good in the long run [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  Money comes and goes.
R:  It does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And good friends come but they shouldn't go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've ha- -- I've had some really good friends that turned around and stabbed me in the back but, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  You still h- hope that the ones you have now are going to be life long friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have any friends that you, like, grew up with, you know, through junior high and high school, that you're still friends with?
L:  Oh, absolutely, yeah.  I --
R:  Do you really?
L:  -- I uh hang out with a lot of my old high school friends.
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty two.
R:  Okay.  Well, you're still ... you're still --
L:  Yeah, well it's not that far back so [LAUGH] ...
R:  -- connected in our [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm fifty nine.
L:  [MN] oh yeah.
R:  And I --
L:  But --
R:  -- you know, my ... my ... there was five of us girls in a car pool and they correspond with my mother every Christmas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... but ... I mean, it's like we're in a different world, you know?  They live in their world and I don't -- I don't even belong there.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I mean, we haven't talked since high school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Long time ago [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  In fact, I --
L:  That -- that's really ...
R:  I found out my -- my very best girlfriend, every year she'd write my mother at Christmas and say I'm gonna ... I'm gonna call at -- on her birthday.  I'm gonna call on her birthday and this year I said, well, I'm gonna be home on my birthday.   Maybe she'll call and we found out that she died.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And it was like, oh my gosh.  We never got to connect.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know and -- and I mean, we lived together, we breathed together, you know, we went on vacations together ...
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  We were the closest of -- I mean, we were like sisters and --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- after thirty years or whatever it was, there isn't any -- any other chance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's sad.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  You move away from where you grew up or where you, you know, [MN] all your best friends were and lose touch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's too bad.
L:  Yeah.  It's kinda interesting that you said that because I [MN] I never thought about it at the time 'cause I was thinking of the -- the here and now with my best friends [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um I actually moved out to the west coast from Alabama where I grew up uh ... my first, like, eleven years and so, you know, I established good friends there and, you know, these were people when I was, you know, younger, I thought um, you know, I'd have these people in my life forever?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But having moved out here and it's only been eleven years, ten, eleven years, I haven't spoken to them in ... yeah, basically, that entire time.  We -- you know, we wrote each other once in a while in, like, the first year or so but, you know, I have no idea about them or ...
R:  Right ... mhm.
L:  ... anything and actually, another friend of mine ... actually, you know, as recently as high school, um, I haven't talked to him since ... well, I do talk to him now and again but it's not the same kind of relationship as it was while we were still in high school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We were a lot closer back then.
R:  Mhm.  And your --
L:  So, that's -- that's kinda interesting thing about, like, who I'm visualizing[?] as, you know, my quote best friend now but then maybe five years down the line ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  It might be totally different.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So ... now [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  That money sounded pretty good [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] Yeah, well, I -- I have -- I have three really, really close friends that would probably do just about anything if I needed -- if I needed something, they would be there.
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  Uh, one is a husband and wife and another is a -- a kid that I work with.  He's thirty seven and uh ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... you know, I -- I travel all over the country with him.  We do shows and uh ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... I ... if I needed something, I think he would be there ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... if at all possible, to help.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but [MN] the rest of the people that I've worked with for twenty two years, I just got laid off.  My -- my girlfriend and I got laid off and uh ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... those people ... nothing.  I mean, I've worked with 'em for twenty two years.
L:  Right.
R:  And there is absolutely nothing.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Nobody's called to say, how're ya doing?
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Course I haven't called them to say, ha ha, I [LAUGH] don't work here any more! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But uh ... you'd think that after twenty two years of working with the same group of people ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  ... that you would keep in touch.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [MN] but we don't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We don't.  We -- it's ... you know, I mean, they -- they were work friends and then you have off work friends.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And the work friends are ... bullshitters [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Super [inaudible], you know?  They're just ... they're in their own little world ... um ... most of 'em were younger than the rest of us.  I mean, they -- they laid off all of us old people that had been there for twenty three years and ...
L:  Oh.
R:  ... kept the young group.
L:  Oh no.
R:  And um ... I don't know.  It's just -- it's a different ... different bunch of people.
L:  Right.
R:  And I'm better off without having ...
