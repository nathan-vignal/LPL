L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Bill.
R:  Hi.  My name is Shelley.
L:  Hi, Shelley.
R:  Where are you from, Bill?
L:  I'm from Elk[?] River, Minnesota.
R:  Okay and I'm from Burbenay[?], Illinois.
L:  Where?
R:  Burbenay, Illinois.
L:  Okay.
R:  About an hour south of Chicago.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um ... okay, our topic is the public school system.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um ... what are your [SIGH] opinions on that?
L:  I think our public school system is uh defunct.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it -- it's a failure.  I think it's obsolete, in dire trouble.
R:  I -- I couldn't agree more.  I ... I think that there's too many kids that are passed along the system and they should not be passed from one grade to the next.  Um ... they just -- you know, they -- they don't want to hold them back so -- and they don't want to deal with them again so they pass them right on for one thing.
L:  Yes.
R:  That's one major issue.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um ... teachers need to be held more accountable for, you know, the grades not being um ... you know, changed to something they shouldn't be.
L:  True, yes.  Well, I have dealt with this situation uh several years ago.  I home school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And um I have -- I agree with you there, that the public schools are -- are -- are um ... um ... in serious trouble because of what -- what you just said but I -- I uh ... I am a Christian and -- and I don't really have a strong issue about prayer in school but I do ... I do think it's rather disingenuous to try to um promote strictly a humanistic secular view while -- while we are still taxpayers and supporters of the system too and we deserve at least equal opportunities to our views.
R:  I -- I couldn't agree more.  I'm a Christian too and I have that exact opinion on it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- as a matter of fact, it's funny this is the topic.  Um ... today, on a bulletin board, I just posted my opinion on that exact subject, how I feel like, you know, even our country in general, how they're wanting to take God out of it ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  ... when we're -- we're founded on God, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  They have to understand, he -- he has to be part of it.
L:  Yes.
R:  And the more that they take him out of it in the schools and so forth and -- and yet --
L:  The more trouble we have.
R:  -- yet they talk about evolution and -- and act like, you know, that's the -- the way it is and they don't -- they won't let creation be part of the teaching even.
L:  Well, they cannot prove evolution.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And that's their same argument for creationism.
R:  Yes.  That's the thing, you know?  It's -- I think --
L:  It's a theory.
R:  The least they could do is at least involve both of them in the -- in the schools --
L:  Well, they should be genuine about their -- their uh open mindedness.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And yes, and -- and let the kids or the people uh make their own decisions.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Rather than pushing their -- you know, their views on ...
L:  Yeah.  I believe the home schools -- uh, home school is -- is a -- it's growing tremendously.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ... because of this, what we're talking about and it's not just a -- a religious type uh s- situation any more.  It's becoming a very popular alternative for ... for um all levels of -- of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um the secular as well as -- as the religious.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And um --
R:  I -- I think one [MN] -- one thing, you know, p- -- I'm not a parent but, you know, I have nieces and nephews in the sy- -- school systems and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... I can definitely relate with, you know, my brother and sister in law telling me what they go through within uh just from my own experiences with it ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... in my school years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, you know, I know the violence even, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  That's gotten so far out of hand now, you know, with children being able to get away with having guns and, you know ...
L:  Yep.
R:  ... it's -- it's just crazy.
L:  Well, the -- the teachers are not allowed to be teachers, maybe -- maybe, you know ... b- before, when I -- I graduated in nineteen sixty eight and uh teachers were allowed to be teachers and they -- they didn't have to deal greatly with discipline.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um ... they were -- they were teachers and if they had discipline problems, they -- they had um the principals or the -- the uh school system itself took care of it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that has changed tremendously, dramatically so now the teachers don't teach a hundred percent of the time.  They teach, maybe if they're lucky, twenty five percent of the time.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And they always seem to be teaching to the least common denominator.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if you look at statistics that are out there now.  This -- this bogus argument that classroom size has any bearing on educational output is ridiculous.
R:  I agree.
L:  I'm a strong supporter of vouchers.  I think vouchers would be the one way that Americans could uh be free to vote, to show what they really mean.  There would not be any more discussion because they uh parents would be able to decide and the numbers would show where they really and what they really feel about education.
R:  I think that's a good idea.  I haven't heard much about it actually, so that's --
L:  Well, vouchers are where, you know, you take the public money that we pay in for taxes ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... and then instead of putting it into a public school system, is you -- you give each parent with students so much of the money, like, say five thousand dollars a year ...
R:  Mm ... mhm.
L:  ... and then the parents decide where the kid will go to school.
R:  Oh.
L:  It will be a public school if they wish, it could be a private school if they wish, [MN] but -- but you will be responsible for choosing where your child goes to get his primary education.  It's holding the parents responsible.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's putting tremendous pressure on the public schools to perform.
R:  Oh, wow, I really love that idea.  I hadn't heard anything about that so --
L:  Well, that's a pretty big issue.
R:  I'll have to do some -- yeah, I'll have to do some research on that now.
L:  Yes, you will hear that being bantered around more and more now because that's um ... gonna be one of the big things that come up.  The public schools are bankrupt.  In our system here in the city of Minneapolis it costs over nine thousand dollars per student per year in the public schools.
R:  Wow.
L:  I paid for private school and I got three times the -- the education for my child for three thousand dollars a year.
R:  Wow.
L:  I'd like a six thousand dollar rebate.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Well, now I'm paying taxes [MN] for public school and doing double duty 'cause I do go to some private school and now I home school because my children are my children and they need an education today.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And in the public schools, they were being held hostage and I could not, in all good conscience, allow that to happen.
R:  Wow.  That's [LAUGH] that's for sure.  At least you know exactly what they are being taught, you can control, you know ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... you have more control over, you know, your ... as far as your beliefs, you know, not -- not other beliefs being put on them and ...
L:  Well, I have an opportunity to be a parent.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And to be involved and have the input that I uh need and -- and I should have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because now you hear them always saying that the -- the parent is the problem.  They need more parental input.  Well, I'm putting in everything I have.
R:  Exactly.  I wish -- wish there was more people like you.  I [LAUGH] really do.
L:  Well, [LAUGH] there are more people like us out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And our voices are starting to be heard because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're starting to get angrier and angrier and we're starting to get more and more political.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we're starting to vote more uh on -- on really primary issues of this nature.
R:  That's terrific.  I know, a lot of my friends home school and I think I would if I had children too, you know?  Once I do, I --
L:  Do you know where home school is growing the fastest?
R:  Which.
L:  It's growing fastest in Japan.
R:  Wow.
L:  And it's because it's such a wonderful alternative to um traditional education.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The -- the resources that are out there now, it's incredible.
R:  Wow.
L:  When you have satellite connections, you have uh videos ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... you have CDs, computers, uh you can go on any [MN] -- any library in the world, you can research, ya de ya de ya de, you can get doctor degrees.  I mean, [MN] the public schools are really obsolete and you're gonna see a huge change in the way primary education is -- is looked at and taught in -- in upcoming years.
R:  Yeah.  I can kind of feel it heading in that direction, just, you know, I think I would know more on the issue if I did have children, you know?
L:  Oh, you would have to because --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you would uh -- you would um ... you would have no choice ...
R:  Exa- -- well, I would want to, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would want to inform myself more on it.
L:  Exactly and you would be able to very easily.
R:  [MN] ... mhm.
L:  Because there's tons and tons of information out there.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  That's one thing the internet's definitely helped us with, is having it at our fingertips now, more readily available than it was, you know, prior to ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... having computers in most homes.
L:  Yep.  Well, this is the information age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if a [MN] ignorant, they really have noone but themselves to blame.
R:  Right.  I agree.
L:  And I could not stay ignorant and look myself and my maker in in -- and say that I did the best that I did for my children if I did not do something.
R:  I agree.
L:  And it's been a wonderful experience.
R:  I'm sure it has.
L:  So, I don't know how long we're supposed to talk.
R:  It seems like it's probably been ten minutes but --
L:  I hope, I don't know [inaudible]
R:  I think something's supposed to come on and tell us.
L:  Okay.
R:  I can -- um, let me look real quick on my phone, if it tells what -- how long it's been.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh it's been nine and a half so any time now.
L:  Well, [COUGH] I -- I -- I'm -- actually, I'm a stay at home dad because of -- I um -- I left my job, my wife now is out making the bread and I am teaching two boys and my eldest son is thirteen and he goes to a private school for three classes because there are some things I just cannot do well at home.
R:  Sure.
L:  Like a lab class, like, he's taking biology and he's gonna be taking chemistry and foreign language.  I am not good at foreign languages.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, he has that and he --
R:  Right.  That's a good thing but --
L:  -- and he has all the social activities and all the social ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... um ... input that -- that he needs um ... that's an argument, that home schoolers are -- are um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- lack.  That's --
R:  I've heard that one.
L:  That's bogus.
R:  It sure is.
L:  And um ... my kids are well adjusted and they're happy and I'm a blessed man.  I get to uh participate in their life the way most fathers never get to.
R:  Oh, that is terrific.
L:  And uh ... I am very passionate about the public schools.  Uh, it- it's -- I've been ... um ... pretty much chomping on the bit for probably seven, eight years now ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... and this debate just keeps getting um more steam ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  ... and uh, some places have passed vouchers and there have been tests, uh court cases about the validity of [MN] public funds being used for private parochial type schools and that but that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that wall is coming down and there is gonna be, I think, a -- a national search for people -- parents to have vouchers ...
R:  Great.
L:  ... and to make these primary basic decisions about their children.
