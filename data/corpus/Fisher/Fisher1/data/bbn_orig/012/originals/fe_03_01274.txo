R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Mark.
R:  Hi, I'm Tina.  How are you?
L:  Hi.  Very good.
R:  Good.  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about current events.
L:  Oh, [SIGH] he said how -- how do we find out about current events, is what I heard him say.
R:  Right, right, exactly.  Um, well, I'm sitting here watching CNN right now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, basically the news is what I do.  How 'bout yourself?
L:  Um, actually I find myself listening to the radio more.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.  And, actually, I like to listen to Rush Limbaugh.
R:  Ah.
L:  W- w- whether [LAUGH] I agree with him or not.  But I find him entertaining.
R:  Rush Limbaugh is -- is -- is a family favorite of mine.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yes.  My father's very -- li- likes him very much.
L:  So, you've listened to him yourself?
R:  Yes, I have.  Uh, my father's been listening to him for probably fifteen years.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I like to, uh -- sometimes he's a little bit off the wall, but --
R:  Yeah, yeah, but --
L:  And I used to work with a guy who [LAUGH] -- who he would listen to him just to d- disagree with him, so it was always fun to talk with him.
R:  Yeah.  He does- doesn't hold back very much.
L:  Well, he -- yeah, but see, he -- he has his -- I mean, he's got his point of view and he's not bashful about it.
R:  Which is -- which is true, yeah.  He's -- he does -- like I said, he doesn't hold back at all if he's -- if he feels something about something, it doesn't matter who it offends, he -- he says it. [LAUGH]
L:  And I don't -- I don't read any newspapers really to speak of.
R:  Um, not myself either.  Um, I'm pretty much a -- a -- a TV news person.  I -- I find myself, uh, constantly flicking through the news channels and so forth.
L:  So, what TV news do you, uh ...
R:  Normally I watch the local news.  Um, but with everything going on in Iraq right now, I tend to watch CNN because it --
L:  CNN.
R:  -- seems to have a broader coverage.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I've done the same thing.  I've watched them and MSNBC.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I've never really cared for local news, like most of the days.  I mean most days.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh, I don't know, the -- the news stories [MN] don't --
R:  They can be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They can tend to be a little depressing sometimes and boring but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I just moved to the area about nine, ten months ago, so I, uh, I tend to find myself, um, trying to find out a little bit more about the area and things and things that go on.
L:  I -- I -- if I look at a newspaper, the problem is I read too much of it, so I'll spend, like, an hour, hour and a half --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just don't have that time usually.
R:  Right, right.  But, uh, yeah, they have the, uh, Pentagon briefing on right now as we speak.  This oughta be interesting. [NOISE]
L:  Do you read, like, local newspapers?
R:  Uh, y- -- oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, um, usually in the morning, sometimes for lunch or something I -- I'll just skim through it, find articles that I'm interested in, but I don't -- I don't go too in depth. [NOISE] Um, [PAUSE] that's -- that's -- newspaper, I don't know.  No, I'm not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not -- not too big on it. [LAUGH] I don't know why. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  But, uh ... local news, I -- I like the nocal- local news on TV, that -- that's a -- a big -- a big thing for me, and with this whole thing -- and my brother's in Iraq right now --
L:  Oh, he is?
R:  So, that's a big interest for me, yeah.
L:  You know, the other thing I've started listening to is, uh, uh, public radio.
R:  Public radio.
L:  Have you ever listened to public radio?
R:  When I'm in my car I do.
L:  You have?
R:  Um, I actually, uh, have a lo- long commute time between work --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh, I tend to listen quite frequently.
L:  Oh, do ya?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.  Yeah, I like them because it -- it -- it certainly gives you a different perspective.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it does.  It -- it's -- it's definitely different than, I'd say, like watching it on TV to hear it.  But, um, [PAUSE] I guess my biggest interest in the news right now is just all about this war.  I -- I've kind of lost -- lost track of all the other stuff in the last few weeks.
L:  No, that's true.  You said your brother?
R:  Yeah, my brother.  My brother's in, uh, in the army, and, uh, he's been sent over.
L:  And he's over there now?
R:  Yes, he's over there now.
L:  Where is he at, do you know?
R:  Uh, no, they don't --
L:  Or they can't tell ya?
R:  I was gonna say, yeah, when he got shipped out, it was unknown destination and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my father's gotten one phone call, but, uh, they're very, very vague about everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're -- you're really left out in -- you know, they just don't give you that information.
L:  So, it wasn't that he didn't know, it's just that he --
R:  Uh, he sounded like he didn't know, too.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I mean, yeah, he's kinda like just clueless, just you get a call and you go, and then there's no questions asked.  But he's been in the military for, like, eleven years, so ...
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] So, uh ...
L:  Yeah, that's gotta be pretty unnerving to have somebody over there.
R:  [MN] Yeah, it actually is.  Um, which is probably why I've taken such a -- a bigger interest in -- in what's going on, um, as opposed to a couple of -- you know, Desert Storm, I don't think I took nearly as much interest in.
L:  Yeah, actually, that's the same with me.  I didn't, uh, I didn't follow it nearly like I am this one.
R:  No, it was more like any time I seen it I flicked the channel, you know, or -- or -- or changed the station or, you know, didn't really get into it too much.
L:  So, what do you think of all this embedded reporter stuff?
R:  Um, as far as?  Explain that one?
L:  You know, well, it -- it sounds like it's a new idea.
R:  [NOISE] With ...?  What's -- what's an em- --
L:  Well, I don't know.  Um, did they -- they didn't have that kind of reporting before, did they?
R:  Oh, no, no.  This -- this reporting is -- is really high tech with, uh, the cameras and -- and the people.  It seems very -- it's very organized.
L:  I just thought it was a brilliant idea to have them in there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, because -- well --
R:  T- t- to a certain degree.  One, yes, because, you know, y- you hear everything, you know, you don- -- you don't have to wonder what's going on that you're not being told about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the second part is -- is -- is I think that a lot of the information is being put on the news that doesn't need to be put on the news.
L:  You mean it's just -- you mean it doesn't need to be why?  'Cause it's inappropriate or because it's just not news?
R:  No, because, um, I -- I think that a lot of the things that are going on, um, as far as having the reporters right there on location and things like that, that there are certain things that are discussed that to me would be a heads up to somebody else.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So, um --
L:  Yeah, I don't know how they control that.  I mean, I imagine it's controlled somehow.
R:  Yeah, I believe --
L:  'Cause occasionally they say they're not supposed to say this or they're not supposed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to divulge that, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- somehow they're controlling it.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That means we're obviously doing something well.  We don't seem to be doing too bad at this point.
L:  I just thought it was smart because, you know, it -- it seems like the press is so skeptical of any reporting.
R:  Right.
L:  And so now they can say, "Look, you know, [LAUGH] it's your own guy giving the report so ..."
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, you -- you wanna be -- in fact, I've heard a couple of the reporters say that very thing.  They said, "Well, you know, we were skeptical about this, but since then we've seen this, that and the other thing".  And so I think just by nature I think reporters tend to be skeptical and then, uh -- but to have the access that they do which --
R:  Right, to be right there, yeah.
L:  Yeah, so now -- and especially with the whole world watching because, um, it -- it's gonna be really interesting, I think, to see in the months to come what news comes out because so much of the opposition to the war has been saying, you know, there's no evidence, there's no, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, why are we there?  We don't need to be doing this.  And, um, but the administration is -- is adamant about, um, you know, the reasons going in.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it -- it -- to me it's gonna be very, very interesting to see in the next --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, when -- when things start to be --
R:  I'd like to see -- yeah, I'd like to see when things settle down and -- and -- and a lot of the information, like when they kinda sum things up once it's over and -- and take out that information that they have right now but can't release to us and put it together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, like, the -- kinda like the, uh, the unseen, you know, what -- what took place that couldn't be discussed at this point.
L:  Mhm, right.
R:  So, I think them collecting that information throughout, it will kinda be, like, maybe historical to a certain degree, you know, as far as our history is concerned and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the specifics, [SIGH] but ...
L:  But I thought that was -- I don't know, I just thought that was pretty -- a good idea, pretty brilliant, I thought.  But we'll see.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.  Only time will tell when it comes to that one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, [PAUSE] this is -- it's just kinda strange.  It's just -- it's just weird to go through day to day life and not real- -- I haven't heard about anything else going on in this country [LAUGH] except for this war.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Nothing at all.  Except for the Smart case, that was interesting.  With Elizabeth Smart.
L:  Oh, yeah, that was a while ago, though.  I still haven't heard anything recently about that.
R:  Um, I've -- well, I've read a few different articles about it.  Um, some updates and things like that, and I guess, uh, they've got quite a few charges on him now.  I guess he's starting to talk and, uh, they've got --
L:  Charges on the, uh ...?
R:  On the --
L:  Guys that kidnapped her?
R:  Yeah, whatever his name was, uh, Emmanuel.
L:  So, was she brainwashed?
R:  She was brainwashed, she was sexually abused, um --
L:  Oh, Jesus.
R:  It's all come out.  It's -- it's -- it was all -- yeah, a little bit of everything.  But I guess they said that she's doing really well.  I mean, she's hanging out with her friends and her family and playing and -- and kinda going back to the same ways, but I guess her sheltered family life -- 'cause she comes from such a very sheltered family -- that, uh, yeah, I -- it's gonna be an interesting ride for her to probably over [NOISE] -- overcome all that.
L:  What do you mean?
R:  Well, I mean, I'm sure that she was probably naive about a lot of things and, you know, never been away from home really, and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, as far as sexual encounters and things like that, it's -- just seems like something her family's -- they're gonna all have a hard time dealing with --
L:  Well, you know, I would think.
R:  -- as far as her innocence and her age and things like that is concerned.
L:  Well, how old is she now?  Eleven or thirteen or ...?
R:  Uh, I think she's fifteen.
L:  Fifteen?
R:  Yeah, I think she's fifteen.
L:  Yeah, I don't, uh -- I mean, I wouldn't want my daughter to have that kind of --
R:  No, I just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't im- -- just -- you know, I really thought that she was --
