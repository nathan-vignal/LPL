R:  Hi.  This is, em, um -- this is [inaudible], um, a second year PhE- PhD student in education linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
L:  And hi, my name is Kelly.  I'm a real estate agent. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  And how do you find out about current events that are going on in the world?
R:  Um, I usually read, like, news articles on the website --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or I watch TV to find out what's going on around the world as well as in this country.
L:  Okay.  I usually, um, find out from watching the news.  Um, stations like MSNBC.  Um, I go on the internet every day to see what's current as well as the newspaper as well as just interacting with other people, finding out different things that I'm not aware of.
R:  Oh, I see.  Can I ask a question?
L:  Sure.
R:  So, I mean, you just said that you are finding out some current events by interacting with people.  I mean, with your friends, I mean, do you usually talk about current, like, political issues or, you know?  I'm just curious to know, especially nowadays, the war stuff.
L:  The war stuff, definitely.  Yeah, just getting people's different opinions about what's going on, why people think that we're fighting, what people think about it, whether they think it's just or unjust.  Um, just different views of how people feel about it.  I think I've been getting a lot of information as far as things going on that I was not aware of.
R:  Mhm.  So, I guess your -- like, your friends are mostly American here -- Americans here?
L:  Correct.
R:  So, I'm just curious to know, you know, the average American's response to that.  'Cause what I'm -- all I can see is from the TV where, you know, mass media is, you know, [inaudible] stars', like, anti war protests or, you know, the politicians, you know, Bush's addresses, th- that kind of, you know, big names' --
L:  Right.
R:  -- response to the war, but not average American people's response to the war.
L:  That's what -- that's -- that's what I feel.  Um, most people that I talk to, every day peers and people that they talk to, most people oppose the war.  To me, I -- I think it's -- it's -- it's wasteful money as well as wasteful lives.  I think that the US could have resolved it another way.  I don't think that the war, um, [LIPSMACK] -- to me it makes no sense.  Because really, once the war is over, they're gonna be back in the same situation or worse than they were when they started, even though they may -- Saddam Hussein may not be there any more.  You have to think, well, who's gonna take his place?
R:  I see.  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I see.  Well, but, um, uh, I myself am an international student, so I'm extra careful in talking about the war or those kinds of political issues in this country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, I -- but th- that's good to know, good -- that's really good to hear, yeah.  As an international --
R:  Yeah, I -- I oppose the war.  I've had family members in the service, and I get their opinions as well, and if they tell me that they oppose the war, then that tells me a lot.  I have two uncles that have retired out of the military, so for them to speak on it as far as a -- a point of view where they've been in the military, they know things that go on that we don't know, then, you know, that -- that made me really realize, you know, this is no reason to fight.  There is no reason.
R:  There is no reason to fight or to sacrifice their lives.
L:  Right.
R:  But they have to be there.  They were assigned to be there, right, right, by the government.
L:  Yeah, correct.
R:  So, that means they don't really have that strong motivation.  I mean, many -- you know, looking at -- looking back at the history, there was s- strong reason to fight for such as independence of their country or just to blah blah blah, but, yeah.  And also, um, watching the TV pr- -- news it -- it really looks like a fictitious, you know.  It's -- it's like video games or something.
L:  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
R:  Yeah, especially I don't really have any family members or anyone that I know [SIGH] in service, so it's kind of, you know, just video games or, you know, just kind of movie, yeah.
L:  Well, you're already -- they're already going into a company that the poverty level is very high, so how do you feel like going into war is gonna help these people?  Actually, you're worsening their situation as well as there are gonna be a lot of innocent lives, a lot of innocent people that are gonna die for no reason.
R:  Right.
L:  And their country is gonna be worse off when it's all --
R:  After the war, yeah.
L:  Right, when it's all said and done with.
R:  And also I'm guessing all those, you know, upper class people or some people, you know, related to Saddam Hussein have left the country already, you know, or they might having, like, vacations somewhere nicer, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think that they are gonna be staying there, so all those [inaudible] ordinary people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no place to go to, you know, to move to, so -- and also, like, women and children, you know.
L:  Yeah.  So, if you wanted to actually -- I was gonna say, if you wanted to actually help their country, each time they let a missile off, I think someone was telling me it's like a million dollars for each missile that they let off.  That's money that you could put into the country to -- to help the country rather than bringing the country down and then you say you wanna rebuild the country.  That -- that -- that makes no sense whatsoever. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.  That's true.  'Cause some people told me that, I mean, you know, all those, you know, um, missiles are -- I mean, if -- from the American perspective, after the war their economy is gonna get better because they need to, you know, um, produce, like, those army product- prod- products, supplies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they need to hire more people, more labor.  I -- I don't know where it started, but in terms -- from the American perspective the war might affect positively on their economy, e- especially, you know, the economy in this country has been really, really slow and unemployment -- unemployment is really high.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't know which way --
L:  A lot of companies are -- are -- are cutting their [PAUSE] due to the war.
R:  So.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and so forth.  So, it -- it's not helping the economy at all because --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a -- a lot of companies, you know, they're cutting their workforces because they're not making as much money as -- as they usually would be making.  I was just watching something about the airlines.  They're gonna be cutting a lot of employees 'cause people are -- are afraid to fly right now, so it's -- it's not gonna help the economy.  It -- it may get better in the end, and then again it -- it may not.  If you think about what happened September the eleventh, the con- -- the economy hasn't gotten any better since then.
R:  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It has been really slow since then, right.  But, um, well -- but the c- -- the country has to send a lot of, you know, military supplies to the servicemen in I- Iraq right now.
L:  Right.
R:  So, they've got to spend all the, you know, stocks -- stock -- they -- they -- I -- I've heard that since there was not any major war or major fight i- in the world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of, you know, um, s- stuff they stocked up, like, in the garage or somewhere. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it -- so this war can be a good chance, good time for them to spend all of them.  And then they can produce something new, some new product and hire more people.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- but I don't really know.  I don't really have any background in economy or anything.  But in terms of, you know, um, like, human rights or justice, yeah, I don't see the reason why they started a -- to the -- they -- they started the war.
L:  May I ask you a question?  What country are you originally from?
R:  Oh, I'm from Korea.  South Korea.
L:  How do -- how do people feel where you're from about the war?  Do they oppose the war?
R:  Yeah.  And also, um, my parents' generation went through the war, the Korean War.  I would say my -- my father, my -- my parents' generation, they really, you know, experienced the Vietnamese War.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There were, like, many Koreans guys in the -- middle age guys in the seventies who were sent to the Vietnamese -- Vietnamese -- Vietnam War by the American government or by the Korean government.  My father was one of them, too, so they know, you know, how horr- horrible, how -- you know, what the war is like.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I would say that most of -- most of the people I -- I have known in Korea opposed to the war, yeah.  But, um -- but, um, we have, like, North Korea all the time.
