R:  Hi, this is Jean Curtis[?] of forty two forty nine Wooddale[?] Avenue, [inaudible], St Louis Park, Minnesota, five five four one six.
L:  Hi, I'm Lesley Griggs[?].  I live at three hundred Tobin[?] Drive, Utah, Texas, seven eight six ten.
R:  [NOISE] Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Affirmative action.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my opinion on that is, I think they sh- should go within -- not within the company -- try to promote within the company.  They sh- -- they should try if people go -- want to get hired, they should pr- -- if they get hired and they come in, if they're qualified for the position, they should get hired for that position.  That's my opinion.
L:  Yeah. Yeah, I think affirmative action can be a good thing, because I know there are people who will still use prejudice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in -- in hiring.
R:  Mhm.  That's my opinion.
L:  Probably.
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  [NOISE] And we're supposed to talk about this for ten minutes? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I guess so.  I don't know if that's ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I suppose affirmative action can be abused, because peop- -- there are all kinds of lawsuits by people who, you know ...
R:  Yeah, they -- and they sometimes discriminate against the women too --
L:  This is true. [NOISE]
R:  -- in the business, because I -- because I was let go from a job.
L:  And you think it was because you're a woman?
R:  You know, I think -- well, it was -- it was two of us they had to [inaudible] -- the one girl had more -- um, knew more about the front desk than I did and she -- and she was full time and I was full time and they couldn't have both of us so they let me go c- -- because they couldn't -- ah, couldn't put my on part time, because they already part timers for the front desk work and they -scriminate because they don't give you raises when they should give you raises.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they always give the guys -- I think they think a guy's more important when they're at the top than a woman is to get the top job.  They don't think women can handle those kind of positions.
L:  Do you think people still get discriminated against because of their color and stuff in hiring situations?
R:  Sometimes they do because they think -- some companies think they have to hire a certain of amount of color- -- the, um, minority.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they can't -- and if they've got a person that's handicapped in the position they can't let -- they -- and they -- they have to let somebody go, they're better off letting the person that's -- can get another job real easy then to k- -- and keep the one that's got the handicap, because otherwise that person's going to say they're discriminated against because they had a handicap.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, I -- I wonder how many people get jobs because the employers are afraid that they're going to get sued or get, you know, accused of discriminating if they don't hire --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a minority.
R:  Yeah, that's true too. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's hard to say one way or the other. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  But it's -- it's still probably important to -- to have affirmative action because I -- I don't know it's -- it's scary how many people still discriminate based on, you know, and --
R:  Yeah and the same with wage wise, still giving -- wage earnings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They'll give more to one person than -- because they think they're better -- ah, the guy will get more [several inaudible words] wage raise and then two people have a ch- -- can get it and one -- or the other one gets it and you don't get it, it means that they think the guy's a better potential for doing the job better than you are.  And I think that's wrong to --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for it to be that way.  And so companies who give raises real fast and stuff and then we don't get -- we don't -- and -- and the company I work for they don't -- [several inaudible words] deserved a raise, they give you a raise.  They didn't go like after thirty days you get a raise or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- after ninety days probation they give you a raise.  If they think you're -- if they evaluate your job and your ability and what you've done and they think you deserve a raise, they give it to you.  If you deserve an honorable mention --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'll give it to you.  But other than that I couldn't say. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know much [LAUGH] ab- -- what to say on that.  Affirmative action.
L:  Yeah, it's sort of a hard thing to talk about for a long time.  I mean, I think you either agree with it or you don't and that's [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Well, I think it's a good policy that they -- you got to have some way to protect yourself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and your job safe.  I took down on -- I -- when I went to do this thing, I took down all the information off the compute- -- off the computer.  So, I have all the questions that they were -- were going to ask. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But ah, [several inaudible words] because I don't have a job and I had to get a job and I would use this as one of my things for getting work.  Do you work at all?
L:  No, I stay at home with my kids.
R:  Mhm.  And it's a good way for you to make some extra money.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I thought too.  To get back into the working world, because I couldn't -- nobody would hire me for what I was doing.  This is the first one I got a call on, was this one and I probably [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah, me too, but I -- I didn't actually, you know, pay that much attention to the topics.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because I wasn't -- well, you know? [NOISE]
R:  No, I just -- I took everything off the computer when I d- did it, because I wanted to make sure that I have all the information on the stuff so that when they called me I had it right there in front of me [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I know what it's about.  So I know what I'm talking about, because they sometimes they give you something and they say, "If you don't understand what it's about and if you don't want to accept it, you don't have to accept it either".
L:  Well, I'm just glad it wasn't sports. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] God.
L:  [LAUGH] That was the one I noticed, but [LAUGH] -- ah.
R:  Well, if they asked about any sports -- I can tell you about some things but not any [LAUGH] -- not a lot of things on TV I don't wa- watch a lot of sports.
L:  No.
R:  So, other than -- well, my daughter ice skates.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yup.  But that's not one of the things we talk [LAUGH] about.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's a sport.
R:  I don't know how long you can talk on this subject.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's a hard thing. [MN]
L:  I'm not all that opinionated frankly. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, there -- there are good things about affirmative action --
R:  [inaudible] Do either of you think affirmative action in hiring and promotion within the business community is a good policy?
L:  Well, you know, I mean it -- it has its good points, but I mean everything has the potential to be abused --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- like with -- through all the lawsuits people have going on over -- you know, over everything.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I agree on that one.
L:  So, --
R:  And there's a lot of companies that freak because they don't get their rates in their company.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If there's a choice between a woman or a man, usually -- sometimes -- well, once in a while women will get the position but a lot of times the guy gets it because they think he's better qualified for the position than a woman is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or it could be because they have to take -- well, they have to give it to a minority because they have to have one minority up in that position --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's not fair to the person that had the -- who had the right to it in the first place.
L:  Yeah and I know looking for a job -- I'm half Japanese --
R:  Oh, you are.
L:  -- and a woman.  So, I always thought, you know, maybe that gives me a little edge, but, you know ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I certainly wouldn't, you know, like file a lawsuit over it or something if it, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it didn't, but I -- I just, you know -- so, I don't worry about the affirmative action thing too much.  I don't know.
R:  No, I have never [several inaudible words] from when I worked there, I was there and I didn't say and I told one lady one time, "I wouldn't say anything, because I didn't want to get myself in trouble".  So, I never said anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She said, "If you don't speak up, you don't get anywhere".  Well, I started speaking up and I got more -- more doings on my job, but when they got new hiring in my company, the company went and said, "They'd like to have kept us on but didn't have any positions available for us".  And the jobs that they were doing, they were hiring f- -- like I was in -- could do day care but they wanted the day care to do half day care, half front desk and I couldn't do both --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I didn't know enough about the front desk.  When they first started out we didn't have as much in the company, ah, at the front desk to do.  Now they got three times more work to do at the front desk than we used to have.  So, it was a lot tougher and [several inaudible words] --
L:  I actually haven't had a -- you know, a job in, gee, almost seven years now.  My son's alm- -- he's seven, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I- I've been out of the work force for awhile, I haven't really had to worry about it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know how much difference it -- it makes -- you know, the affirmative action, I don't know how much --
R:  You just got the one or -- or have you got more than one?
L:  I have three now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you got three now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, your oldest is in second grade?
L:  My oldest is seven, yeah.  So.
R:  In the second grade.  So, you've got a second grader and all your little ones.  Well, it's good to stay at home.  I stayed at home [NOISE] -- I was working, then I stayed at home after my kids were -- my daughter was born --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for awhile and then I went back to work -- after she was three years old I went back to work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I was out of work for three years.
L:  Well, my youngest is three now but ... [PAUSE]
R:  [several inaudible words].  So ...  Well, this is something you can do on the side when he's taking a nap or whenever you have extra time on your hands.
L:  Yes.
R:  It makes a little extra money.
L:  Just a little. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Depending on how often they call you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  There's something -- [PAUSE] I don't even know [LAUGH] how long we've been on the phone. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, I suppose they'll tell us when it's ten minutes.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I hope they do --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] forever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I think they're supposed to tell us when it's do- -- when the thing is over. [NOISE] And I don't know what else to say about this.
L:  I can't think of anything else to say about affirmative action.
R:  No, I can't either [several inaudible words] but one of the -- I -- that was the easier subject but it was
