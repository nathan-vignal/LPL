R:  Hi, I'm Chelsea.
L:  Hi, this is Betty.  I'm Betty, how are you doing?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  Wh- -- I'm okay.  Um, so affirmative action, that's our topic?
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] Well, being a minority, I think affirmative action is appropriate, um, because we got to get the system equally balanced, don't you think?
R:  Yeah, I totally agree.
L:  Um, what objections -- when -- when would you feel an objection to it?  Ah, [several inaudible words] you feel though?
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Because my daughter, she -- she goes to a college [several inaudible words] and, um, it's a predominantly black school or historically black school and so the whites go there as a minority.  So, it works in favors everywhere, a lot of people are saying, "It's -- it's just the blacks and Hispanics", I disagree.  I -- I see the difference now, um, I don't think we should do away with, um, affirmative action, even though you use affirmative action you also -- also looking at the person's skills and knowledge, don't you think?
R:  Yes.  Um [PAUSE].
L:  Aha, okay?  I -- I -- are you still there?
R:  Yeah, I'm still here.
L:  Oh, okay.  You didn't say anything!
R:  I'm sorry, my phone's cutting out.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, there's a lot of laws that should come off of the books, but can't come off of the books because we can't get it straight, right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just at this time.  L- look at what's going on right now, we shouldn't be in conflict with -- in another country, but until everybody's equal you have to have things like that in place.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.  Now, where are you from?
R:  I'm from Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay and see we're in the Washington DC area.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Right.  And so we see a lot of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where we are.  And it -- it's really helped my children, because my children are adults and it -- it's just so po- -- that their o- -- their outlook is so much more positive than mine, because I grew up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the South when there were segregation and things like that.  And my -- my parents didn't make a lot of money, they couldn't get the good jobs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now it's -- it's mandatory to give a person an equal shot at everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we're al- -- we're also retired military.  We couldn't have gotten the things we received now without that affir- affirmative action.
R:  Right.  Definitely.
L:  Mhm. --
R:  And see I'm in college also, so I've, you know, um --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I grew up in a totally different era, so.
L:  Aha.  Oh, okay.  So, what -- what d- differences do you see now, from then?
R:  Oh, just equal opportunity for everything, either men, women, blacks, minorities, Hispanics, you know, everything.
L:  I got a question for you.  You know when you're filling out a job application and they ask for demographics and they say it's optional, do you fill that part out --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- when they're trying to keep track?
R:  No, I don't.
L:  I know we -- we find it hard to want to fill it out as well.  I know what they're trying to do, to keep count and to see if there's really a need for these services, but y- you should be hired on the basis of your qualifications.
R:  Not of anything else, correct.
L:  Yeah, but we can't get there yet, um --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't think they'll get there before my lifetime. [LAUGH] Maybe not --
R:  And probably not before mine either. [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe my grandchildren. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm -- as a matter of fact, I'm sitting in Kansas with -- holding my first granddaughter --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- very first grandchild, she's five months old.
R:  Aw!
L:  And I -- I h- h- hope things are so much different for her than for me.  I really do.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Now, are you married?
R:  No, I'm single.
L:  Oh, okay.  Living with the parents?
R:  No, I -- I live in Denton actually, go to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- school up here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  At U.N.T., University of North Texas, so.
L:  Oh, okay.  Very good!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Congratulations!
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] thanks. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I've got a daughter that's a pre med major and --
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  -- she's enjoying it so much.  Oh!  And if we didn't have services like, you know, affirmative action in place, a lot of people wouldn't be able to get into schools or -- or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in -- in the doorway of a office building, because of the color of their skin or male -- male or female, things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Women will never catch up with the pace of a -- a white male, you know that?
R:  Mm.  Right.  Correct.  Never.
L:  Di- did you hear on television the other day they were talking about scales, pay scales?  The average white male with a bachelors degree, I think they said made something like sixty thousand dollars, just right off the bat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but a black male made forty percent of that, with the same qualifications.  Um, no, no, no a wo- -- a woman made forty percent of that.  A white women made forty percent of that.  A black male was even less than that forty percent.
R:  Really?
L:  That's ridiculous.
R:  That is.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah and -- um, what I -- I want to be a police officer.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I mean that's a predominantly male field --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- and I mean it's going to -- it's -- I mean, everybody's like, "You don't want to do that, you're a girl" and it's like, "You know, just because I'm a girl, doesn't mean I can't do that".
L:  Question then.  Would you fight, um, a war for your country?
R:  Would I?  Definitely.
L:  Oh, I'm glad to hear that.  Because with affirmative action -- we still won't put women in combat, you know that right?  We --
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  Um, we will not put them in hand to hand combat.  We let them fly planes, we let them go on ships, but they cannot go into combat, as of yet and I think we need to work on that.  I -- I -- the military's one of the last die hard groups, I guess.  They just find it hard to rewrite those laws and -- and change things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  D- do you know you -- ah, being in the military, if you have an extramarital affair they can just, um, fire you?  Dismiss you out of the service.
R:  An extra what?
L:  Ah, an affair.  They can --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- fire you for adultery.  I mean, there's laws on the books you wouldn't believe.  You can't curse in front of women -- they don't reinforce that one, which they need to.  But that's -- that's what I mean by affirmative action --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the laws don't keep up with time and -- and that's wrong, that's why we can't be equal at -- in everything we say and do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, we've got to have affirmative action on that aspect of it.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, is this your first phone call with them?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] We're on number two. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, so.  But I'm sitting here in Kansas enjoying some beautiful weather right now.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  I could say that was affirmative.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] How's your weather?
R:  Um, it's about sixty degrees.
L:  Oh, that's not bad at all.
R:  No, it's pretty nice outside, actually.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] N- now, you said you were from Texas, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now, what do you think about the death penalty then, when you look at the disparity between the -- the -- um, the blacks and whites and min- minorities on death row versus whites on death row? [NOISE]
R:  I am all for the death penalty.
L:  But d- do you know there's such a great disparity, more blacks are committed -- put on death row than --
R:  Than whites are, yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I don't think that's fair at all.  And I mean, the, um -- ah, the -- ah, like killers or people that are going to put on death row, like murderers and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, sixty percent of them are white males, it should be, you know --
L:  [inaudible], yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] sixty percent of criminals are white males, but you don't see sixty percent white males on death row.
L:  You think?  You -- you've heard that, it's sixty percent?
R:  Yes, it is six- --
L:  I didn't know it was that high.
R:  It -- yes, it is.  It's a -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] so that's what's reported?  Because I think blacks tend not to report domestic --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- disputes and things like that.
R:  That's UCI Uniformed Crime Report.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, yeah, that's in my criminal justice books. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Now, see I'm a social worker. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah and that's a good fact to know.  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But see, al- -- also, when you're looking at affirmative action, more whites are able to get legal representation, um, than, ah, minorities.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because it's very expensive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, maybe we -- maybe we should have, ah, things like, um -- um, our -- our legal services at a set rate, so everyone could get a fair shot at it --
R:  Right or [inaudible].
L:  [inaudible] the trial.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, I got another question. [NOISE] Have you actually ridden with the police yet or are you just going through your courses?
R:  No.  Yeah, I've ridden four times.
L:  Okay.  Do they tend to, um, single out a certain group, certain type, certain car or anything to -- you know, to stop more or to look at harder?
R:  Um, not really.  Usually we just run the license plates --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just to see what's going on or if they look suspicious then yeah, we're going to pull them over, no matter what -- you know, what car or anything like that.
L:  In the DC area, blacks are pulled over at a rate, I think, like four to one --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and -- and that's ridiculous.  It really
