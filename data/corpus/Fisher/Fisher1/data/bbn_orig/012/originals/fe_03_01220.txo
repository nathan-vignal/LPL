L:  Hello.
R:  Hello [LAUGH].
L:  Hi, I'm Jessica.
R:  Hi, I'm Stacey.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  I guess we have to talk about this topic.
L:  Yeah which is so weird 'cause it's like zero hour.  I'm like, watching the countdown on TV.
R:  I know.  It's freaky.  Um ... well, I guess, um ... I was home schooled in high school so [LAUGH] um ...
L:  So, you don't know [LAUGH] about the public schools?
R:  Well, I know a lot about them and I didn't actually um ... go to one for um -- well, I -- I went to a catholic school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ... but then uh ... I got taken out of it because I was like ... picked on and stuff [LAUGH].
L:  Oh no [LAUGH].
R:  For, like, really dumb reasons 'cause I just had an accent.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  Um ... so, my parents home schooled me, um, but um then my -- my two sisters, they went to -- to public schools.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ...
L:  [COUGH]
R:  ... and I think, like, from what I could compare between, like, my home schooling experience and like, the public school, it was like a ... a weird um ... like, they didn't focus a lot on, like, writing or reading or anything like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just the basics and then, you know, what I noticed when I went to college was that a lot of the kids who had gone to the school system in my area ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  ... so, it's not like, public schools in general but ... they were like, I guess, overwhelmed with, like, the ... the writing and reading aspects.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  What do [LAUGH] you think?
L:  I went to public school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And my mum's a public school teacher.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.  So, um, like, my [inaudible] was -- was pretty good with public school.
R:  Really?
L:  But there's actually like ... I'm the first person to ever actually go to a ... well, I'm like the first one to ever to go to Penn from my school.
R:  Oh, no kidding?
L:  [COUGH] yeah and I'm the first, like, only like the fifth to go to an Ivy League school.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But it's -- it wasn't that my school, like, wasn't up to snuff, like, it was still there but it's just they never had any recruiters, like, from any Ivy League school come to our school so noone even --
R:  Right and I think that's a problem 'cause there's a lot of kids who have a lot of potential in public schools.
L:  Right.
R:  And they just don't get, like ...
L:  Exactly, 'cause like --
R:  ... yeah, I went -- well, are you familiar -- do you know where Franklin[?] and Marshall[?] is?
L:  In Philly?
R:  Um, in Lancaster[?]?
L:  No, in Lancaster?
R:  That's where I went to school.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um ... but I took, like, well, I -- I partially took a class at ten so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  ... um [LAUGH].  I took, like, one class there, a Bio class.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ...
L:  Yeah, I know a couple of people that did that.  They would just go around ten in high school and then they took, like, a class at ten [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah ... um ... I mean, and I ... I don't know.  I mean, I guess, I -- I really don't ... I mean, my sisters are in public school now.  My one sister is in public school in Maryland.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she is absolutely happy with it.  I mean, the curriculum is terrific, she's getting, like, a phenomenal education and she has, like, um ... a lot of uh opportunities that wouldn't be available to her at another school.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  I just feel like it ... it's not even the public, private issue.  It's like, completely the area issue.
R:  I think so too.
L:  Like, our area was ... was pretty good, like, it was pretty well off, like, not -- like, not extremely well off but, you know, like, upper middle class.
R:  Right.
L:  But we just had no exposure to, like, Ivy League at all but then, where my mum teaches, it's like, twenty minutes away but, like, you cross over a certain highway ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you're in, like, a completely different neighborhood.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they have, like ... she has, like, criminals in her classroom and they always have threats and, like ... she teaches in, like, a really tough school, like, a really bad school.
R:  That's crazy [LAUGH].  Yeah, I mean, I -- I don't -- I agree.  I don't think it's the school 'cause I know -- I mean, I know my next door neighbor was a public school teacher and she was just as good, if not better, than -- than any of the um ... you know, private school teachers that I also knew.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so I don't think it has to do with teachers or ... or anything like that.  I think it has a lot to do with the area and where these kids are growing up.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, they probably don't have any, like, parental support back at home and ... I mean, they're, like, I guess -- I think it's like upper Marion[?] or something like that, has, like, a really, really good school district and like, their public school kids get like, some of the top scores in the country, I think.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm pretty sure.
L:  I feel like um ... it's more, like ... I don't know, for the past couple of years, the public school system has, like, catered more to parents and catered more to children because, like, they're so afraid of getting sued and they're so afraid of getting lawsuits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I know my mum, like, she had a student, like, cuss at her the other day ...
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  ... and she sent him to the office, like, that happens, it's like, nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she sends him to the office and nothing happened to him, like, they don't get detention, they don't get suspended.
R:  No.  I [MN] -- one of my sisters was telling me that her um ... her friend walked into a classroom and, like, used the f word at the teacher and nothing happened.
L:  Yeah, that's a -- it happens to my mum, like, all the time and --
R:  Because the parents will just complain.
L:  And the te- -- like, the schools, they don't back the teachers.  I think that's the main problem because it's like, you're not being backed and you're a teacher, you're not gonna have the motivation to do anything about the problem, if it's only you against, like, this whole big world.  If you don't have your administration behind you.
R:  Right.
L:  Because the administration is so scared of what's gonna happen to them which is really ... it, like, shows -- it reflects on our society.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's kind of ridiculous that we live in a world like that but ...
R:  I know [LAUGH].  I completely agree.
L:  And actually, like, I'm really passionate about this subject.  I have wanted to um ... go into the America ... America teachers ... the, like, the Teach for America thing?
R:  Yeah, like, is that like Americor or ...?
L:  It's kind of like Americor, like, you have to teach for two years and, like, you pick out a -- a sign[?] ... it's like teaching instead of, like, working.
R:  Right.
L:  But, my mum, like, said [LAUGH], "No" basically [LAUGH].
R:  Because it's dangerous?
L:  Because it's dangerous and 'cause she just doesn't, like, -- she's like, "If you want to be a teacher, you could have gone anywhere" like, why --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't know.  I act- --
R:  I think -- I mean, I don't -- I really -- I mean, I don't know if it's [MN] -- I don't think it's a problem that -- I mean, I guess it's -- in the -- the administration stuff in the schools and I don't -- I'm not really familiar with what's happened lately.  I know that like, the Philadelphia schools were taken over by ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... something ... um, I forget the name of it, um ...
L:  It was like a private company, I think or something.
R:  Right and I don't know if that has, you know, anything to do with anything.  Um ... I mean, I'm -- I've lived in the suburbs my entire, like, life here in Pennsylvania.
L:  Right.
R:  Um and then -- I mean, the only personal school experiences I have were in parochial and home schooling.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I mean, I've seen my sisters and, you know, all my friends went to public school and all of them are doing very well.
L:  Right.  I completely think it's like, it's the area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's actually, I think, since we've been in school, it's changed so much 'cause I know ... I work on a research study and our study involves going into schools.  I actually -- I spent eight hours in a public school in Philly today.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And in um ... it's just changed so much from, like, what I remember, like.
R:  Really?
L:  Even, like, I went into one last week and I had fifth grade and I was, like, moved to tears, like, because children couldn't read at all.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Like, I was sitting there.  We -- uh we have like a simple survey to give them and I was reading it to them.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And it was -- it was just so sad and, like, so moving ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  ... that they couldn't read.  It was like ...
R:  Now, do you think it has to do with the actual school or do you think it has to do with their family life or ...?
L:  I think it's -- I think it's a combination of both because ... like, the ... I don't know ... the teachers are afraid of the parents because the administration doesn't do anything and so, because they're afraid of them, the teachers aren't pushing the parents.
R:  Right.
L:  And since because they're not pushing them, the parents aren't doing anything.
R:  Well, yeah because, I mean --
L:  So, it's like a vicious cycle, like, one's afraid of the other, so they're not gonna --
R:  Exactly 'cause years ago, I mean, if you were doing badly in school, the teacher would contact your parents.  I mean, I remember when I was in parochial and catholic school, um, if I got a bad grade on a test, that test was stapled to a folder and brought home so that my parents could see it.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I mean, not that I was, like, doing badly on tests every week but, like, when it did happen, it was, like, motivation for you not to do poorly.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ... 'cause you didn't want your parents to be disappointed in you 'cause that meant a lot.
L:  Right.
R:  And now, it's like, it doesn't even matter.
L:  Yeah, it doesn't --
R:  'Cause the teachers are too afraid, I mean, it doesn't matter if a kid gets a bad grade because um they aren't allowed to flunk kids.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, my mum's gotten, like, in trouble for failing kids before.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Which is ridiculous 'cause she teaches ... she'll end up teaching the same kids, like, in [MN] English eleven twice.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, like, she can't fail them.
R:  That's nuts and then they go forth into the world [LAUGH] and they --
L:  And they just go through and that's how, like, these kids in this elementary school just keep getting passed on, even though they can't read.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  I could not imagine and -- I mean, back in the day, everybody was held back.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, in -- I mean, I don't agree with some of the reasons why, you know, I mean, I had friends who were held back for really stupid reasons.
L:  Yeah, if you were held back for, like, ridiculous things [several inaudible words] like -- like being too short and like --
R:  Yeah like -- or if you mooched around in your seat ...
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  ... you were held back [LAUGH] or something like that but um ... and now, I mean, it's just ... I don't think anybody is or, I mean, and the kids just get so frustrated and -- or they just drop out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I know a lot of kids in my school district um ... and the mentality, I think, is completely different.  I don't think kids go to school with the intention of, like, getting anything out of it other than the fact that they have to be there a lot of the time.
L:  Yeah.  There's [MN] -- there's no motivation.
R:  I know [LAUGH].  I feel like I left school in a good time.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know but I mean, my sisters have all done ... done really well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... in school.  I mean, my -- well, my little sister and my other sister um ... we had some trouble with the public school because she was sick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ... for two years with [inaudible] disease and the public school was not very um ... good at dealing with the fact that she couldn't attend school.
L:  Oh my [MN] --
R:  Like, she had to be homebound um ... and the school wasn't ... I mean, they gave her a lot of hard time and then ...
L:  Right.
R:  ... when she went back to school, um, they were really rough on her, e- -- you know, even though it -- they knew she was struggling to catch up with this material, they were very, very hard on her ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  ... when it wasn't her fault and they would ...
L:  That's really [inaudible] --
R:  ... the teachers would accuse her of um ... said it was in her head and that she wasn't actually sick, you [MN] ...
