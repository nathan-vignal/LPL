R:  Hi.  This is Paul.  Who's this?
L:  Hi.  This is PJ.  How are you, Paul?
R:  Doing okay.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  This is quite a topic.
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda -- kind of bizarre.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, would ya?  Take the million?
R:  Uh, I'd have -- I'd have to say no.  I have money -- you know, money is tight and money is important but uh, I just can't give up a good friend for it.
L:  I totally agree, totally agree but it's tempting.  A million dollars.
R:  Yeah.  I did have to think about it for a minute or two [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] so --
R:  'Cause uh ... I don't know about you but I'm -- I'm sure that [MN] most people have, you know, that -- that what if scenario running in their head, what if I did have a lot of money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or could get a lot of money easily ... but uh, I think that -- this one's priced just a little too high for me.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I'd have to say, my best friend number one is my mother, number two is my youngest daughter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so I'd be giving up a family member on top of it, you know?  It's just not worth it.
R:  Yeah, I agree with you. [SIGH]
L:  So, who's your best friend.
R:  Uh it's uh ... uh, right now it's a guy that I met here at uh school.  He and I have been working together and doing stuff together for about four years.  We uh work on projects together, play games together, stuff like that.
L:  That's cool, that's cool.  Well, you know, I think you'd probably have to stop and think, is there a way around it?  You can't talk to your best friend ever again but how are they ever gonna prove it?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hey, but what about email [LAUGH]?
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  What about the changing of identity [LAUGH].  So, I mean, what would they -- what would they do if you spent the money and ... then reconnected with your friend?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If they found out later, what would they do about it?
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I didn't really think about it that far into the theoretical.  I just thought about the actual, you know, philosophy type choice as opposed to uh if it -- if it take -- if it ever really did happen, I'd probably come up with some interesting way of trying to get around things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can never play by anybody else's rules, you know?  Gotta -- gotta see if you can find the holes in 'em.
L:  Right.  One thing about a hypothetical situation is, is just that, hypothetical.  You really don't know what you'd do until you're faced with it.
R:  Yeah.  And a lot of times it's because some of the important details are missing.
L:  Right, right.  That -- it depends on the dire straits that you're in at the time.
R:  Yeah, that too.  [MN] Maybe in a year or two, I'll change my answer [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].  Well, this is really a weird subject.  It's -- it's so much of a yeah, I would or no, I wouldn't and hard to talk about, I think.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.
L:  [MN] Well, we have to talk about it for ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Oops!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm saying oops because none of my other calls lasted nearly that long.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't get paid.  You don't get paid unless you talk ten minutes.
R:  Where does it say that?  I missed that part.
L:  Oh, really?  When you signed up for it, it tells you, you must talk the whole ten minutes to get paid.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that'll teach me to do things without reading them very carefully.
L:  You don't read, ah ha! [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Stupid!
L:  I always read the small -- the smi- -- the ... I'm sorry, I always read the small print.
R:  Oh, I u- -- I do.  The thing is, I signed up for this over a month and a half ago and so much has happened between now and then, you know?  I -- and I signed up for a lot of different uh survey setups so I -- I wasn't sure which ones had which setups on 'em any more.  And I -- [MN] the only info I could find on the email was, you know, how to -- how the calls would work.  Didn't -- didn't actually say anything about the parameters.  Nope.
L:  So, you do a lot of surveys by mail, huh?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've uh found it's a good way to pick up spare cash in my free time.
L:  I've been signing up but I tell you what?  All's I'm getting is a chance to win this or a chance to win that, no cash really.
R: [NOISE] There's a site on the web --
L:  Not going into the right ones, I guess.
R:  -- where -- there's a site on the web somewhere that lists them all and you go through them and maybe one out of ten or maybe one out of twenty actually pays per survey.
L:  I see.  You don't have to pay any money out to get on any of 'em?
R:  None of the reputable ones.  I don't bother with the ones that try and -- try and scam ya out of --
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] and as I told my mum when I was looking for this stuff, if anybody asks you for an upfront fee for you to work for them, it's a scam.  I mean, [MN] it may not be but the odds are that it is.
L:  Okay.  Back to the subject.  
R:  Right.  [COUGH]
L:  So, if you did take that, how do you feel it would affect you in the long run?
R:  In the long run?  Actually, probably not too much because, I mean, he's a- -- actually about to move away anyways.  We're both uh going our separate ways in a year or two, so it would just mean parting about a year -- year and half earlier.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, in the long run, it wouldn't affect me but still, you know, never even to be able to just drop -- drop him a phone call, you know?  I don't know.  Again, like I say, it depends on the details.  The details are important and we -- you never get details in a hypothetical.  It's always so black and white.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I would think that maybe you couldn't talk to 'em personally but you could have a go between, you know?  Talk for ya, back and forth then you wouldn't be breaking the rules.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right?
R:  Hopefully.  'Cause I mean ... it depends -- again, it depends on who's drawing this thing up 'cause you know, if I was the one offering the million bucks, you can bet I'd make it airtight.  No [inaudible] or no contact whatsoever.
L:  Well, how is anybody gonna prove you contacted 'em though?
R:  This is true but would you wanna take the risk?
L:  Well [COUGH] ... I would sign something and make it totally legit ... I will not contact 'em, I will not personally contact 'em, okay?  That's not to say I couldn't have someone else contact them for me.
R:  Yeah.  True enough.
L:  And they didn't say that you couldn't um ... have a mutual friend that always talks to them, send pictures and look at your friend's pictures, that sort of thing.  It would depend.  I mean, if it was a lifelong friend ... but I'm a lot older than you and friendships come and go.  I do not have a friendship from someone I went to school with today.
R:  Yeah I've ... I've been noticing that as -- as uh you move to a new place, your -- your old friends kind of fade away and you -- you make new ones.
L:  Or you outgrow them or they outgrow you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Your interests change.  I had one friend that I hadn't seen in uh probably about twenty years, came back, looked me up.  I mean, we were really looking forward to seeing each other, only to find out, we had absolutely nothing in common, nothing and it was kind of weird.  It was like the memory of what we had was better than actually getting together and being together again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  O- only to find out, we had grown so differently and -- and our morals and thinking and likes and dislikes and ... it -- it wasn't the same person any more, you know?  So, I might be tempted to take it.  It -- it really would depend.  Then, you could invest it and share it with them.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I'm sure that uh i- if the other person knew the details and I also wanted to split it with them, they would have no hard feelings.
L:  Right, exactly.  If you invested the whole thousand -- uh whole million dollars and never touched that million dollars and just lived off the interest, that'd be a pretty nice chunk of change coming in every year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you could split it with them.  You'd still have your original million and you're just splitting the interest and it would help both of you out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... how long have we been talking [LAUGH]?  I signed up for this thing, they called me the first night on the wrong number and then I gave up on 'em.  I haven't heard anything from 'em for, like, almost two weeks so I didn't figure they were gonna call me.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I'd almost given up hope too because, you know, a month had gone by and I'd heard nothing [NOISE] but uh yesterday night I started getting calls.
