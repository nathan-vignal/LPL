R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Hi.
R:  My name's Marcia.
L:  My name is Fred.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you, too.
L:  Yeah.  Um, so, uh, my -- uh, I -- I -- um, I live in San Diego right now, and I study, uh, for a computer[?] science, uh, master degree, and I'm taking, uh, speech +recognition class, so that's why I've changed to join this program.
R:  Oh, all right.  Uh, what's your first language?
L:  Uh, Chinese.
R:  Oh, all right.  Um, let me see, ni[?] how[?].
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Good.
R:  That's all the Chinese I know.
L:  Oh, cool. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow, cool.  Uh, where -- where do you mean -- did you learn that?
R:  Uh, from some Chinese --
L:  Oh.
R:  From some Taiwanese, uh, people.
L:  Oh, right.  Yeah, I'm from Taiwan actually.
R:  Oh, you -- pardon me?
L:  I -- I'm from Taiwan.
R:  Oh, you are?  Okay.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, these were, uh, some Taiwanese firefighters.
L:  Firefighters?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, uh, you're -- you're in New York?
R:  I was teaching them search dog work for disaster dogs.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, and I'm in Seattle now.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so -- so you wanna work on your English?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  How -- I forgot, how long is this supposed to last?
L:  I'm -- um, I don't know.  That's my first time.
R:  Oh, my -- it's my first time, too.  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  Anyway --
L:  Okay.
R:  How do you keep up with world events?
L:  Uh, well, c- can you explain what -- what that topic means?  Explain to me?
R:  Oh, all right.  Um, how do you get your news?  In other words --
L:  Uh, oh, all right, all right.  Uh, mostly from internet.
R:  Okay.  Oh, what sites do you do?
L:  What sites?
R:  What -- what ones -- what ones do you go to?
L:  Uh, you mean what -- what -- what kind of website do that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, usually I went to -- there is a -- a homepage called sina[?] dot com and that's because th- that's Chinese version website.  So, it's much easier for me and also that's, uh, graphic based so I don't have to worry -- worry about the -- the font, Chinese character --
R:  Right.
L:  Right.  So, mostly I -- 'cause I up in the States just for, like, five years so, um, I still, you know, like to go to the Chinese website and read some news here and news in Tai- Taiwan and news everywhere.
R:  Well, I occasionally read the English language news from Taiwan.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that's surprising.  Well, when you had an earthquake and everything and I wanted to find out --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if our people -- [SIGH] the people we train went to it or anything like that, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I occasionally check it out.
L:  Okay.  Oh, that's good.  So, how -- how do you get the chance to join this program?
R:  Um, this is mostly volunteer work, but after your big earthquake --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- people, um, uh, decided they wanted to do it and make -- they wanted -- we knew somebody who knew somebody and, um, [SIGH] um, an American food -- dog food company, pet food company, and their Taiwanese representatives, uh, sponsored it.
L:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.  I see.
R:  So, it worked out pretty nicely.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I get most of my s- -- but you mostly go to a Chinese site, is that correct?
L:  Um, not actually, the -- it's just -- just for the news and stuff and -- but except that I usually go to CNN dot com.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right.  Like recently, most of the war news and I usually go to C.N. dot com and get some updates, right.
R:  All right.  Well, I go -- I listen to national public radio.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Are you familiar with that at all?
L:  I'm not actually.
R:  Okay.  Um, it's not a government site, but it's, uh, a private thing but has to do with the government.  Are -- are you familiar with, um -- [LAUGH] can't even think of it.  Uh, public television, the educational television station?
L:  Mm, not really[?], not very.
R:  Okay.  Well, we have that and national public radio is -- has radio stations throughout the country.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it's news and -- and other things, but it's all talk.  But it -- it -- it doesn't tend to be as crazy as some of these talk sites.  It -- it's not --
L:  I see.
R:  -- right wing or left wing or anything like that, and people --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- don't yell at each other usually.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  But, um, I like it because you can get it anywhere in the country so when we're traveling I can still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- listen to the same news with the same people.
L:  Oh, of cour- -- but may I know what -- what channel?
R:  Well, it will be down at the end -- one end of your station on F.M.
L:  Okay.
R:  And ours here is eighty eight --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- point nine or -- or, what, nearly -- no, it's -- ours is ninety four point nine.  But there's an eighty eight point five.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, um, it's very nice because it's -- it's without commercials.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, that's a good thing.
R:  And I -- go ahead.
L:  Oh, no, no, no.  I think the site without commercial is good.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Or is -- or you --
R:  I mean, they give things.  They say this is sponsored by or, you know --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- they provided the funding, but we don't have commercials otherwise.
L:  Okay.
R:  Except two times a year they ask for money.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  And they want you to s- send in money.  Well, in Great Britain, for example, if you wanna listen to the radio stations, you have to pay, uh, a fee.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they go around trying to find out who hasn't paid their fee.
L:  Okay.
R:  But then they don't have advertising.
L:  I see.
R:  But this one they just want people to give money.  But I like it because it provides in depth coverage --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, uh, it's just -- and it -- they try to make it as non biased as possible.  Obviously you can't do that.
L:  I see.
R:  But, uh, that's how I get my -- most of my news.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then the rest is from reading the newspaper.
L:  Okay.
R:  And from go- -- oh, yeah, I go online, too.
L:  Yeah.  That's quickest way --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to go online and -- and -- and search whatever you want, right.
R:  Right.  And I'll tell you, when you go on, I have, uh, one site that you might like to see.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  This one is funny.
L:  Oh.
R:  Or it's strange, we'll put it that way.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's called the obscure store and reading room, and I'm going to it right now.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I'll -- I'll give you the thing.  It's W.W.W.
L:  Yes.
R:  Dot obscure, O.B.S.C.U.R.E.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Store, S.T.O.R.E. dot com.
L:  Okay.
R:  And they have all the strange news --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that people send in.  Some of it is pretty awful.  Some of it is nice.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But there are just silly, crazy things.  It says -- one of them, the titles is, "Americans have gone absolutely crazy for the word 'absolutely'".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, oh, here's another one that has to do with the business today, and it's really -- some of these are stupid, but, "French cleaners goes up in flames.  Fire chief won't call it arson".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because it's got the name "French".
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, but there are just other ones -- uh, here's another woman that she survives a second, uh, twister.  In other words, um, [LIPSMACK] not a cyclone, it's a [SIGH] -- I can't even -- tornado, to hit her home in three years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, so it's got a lot of stuff.
L:  I see.  But -- but -- just a minute.  You said A.B.S.C.U.R.E. store dot com, right?
R:  O.B.S.
L:  O?  Oh, O.B.S.
R:  O.B.S.C.U.R.E. store dot com.
L:  Oh, I -- I got it.
R:  Obscure means -- I mean, these -- these are getting into English words that you're not -- that shouldn't be -- that I don't expect will be familiar with.  Obscure means, um, little known.  In other words, not many people know about it.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Obscure means it's -- it's something that you wouldn't see every day, so it's a -- it's a --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- strange site, let me tell you.
L:  Okay.
R:  But [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] I thought that I -- I -- I get online and then -- and saw the website and it's called --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, you -- you're looking at, "Groomed killed in crash --"
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  "-- while driving to his wedding"?
L:  Yeah, right, right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Whoa [MN] --
R:  Oh, well, good.  See, I've got something --
L:  Whoa, man. [LAUGH] Really obscure, huh. [LAUGH]
R:  But, oh, this is -- I haven't seen this.  Um, "Interested in how the news media are covering the war?"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "Check out the links on my +Romanesque page".
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, okay.  He has some other pages, so it -- it shows you what other countries are saying and everything.
L:  Oh, I -- I saw that.
R:  Which is good.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the other thing about national public radio here up in, uh, the Seattle area is they carry the British Broadcasting Company, the BBC.
L:  Mhm.
R:  At night, uh, way late in the -- early in the morning, late at night, and I really enjoy that just because again it's a different viewpoint.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  Well, that's good site.  I'll check that --
R:  So, I don't know how much -- I don't remember how -- if they expect you to speak for any length of time or not.  Let me see what it is ... okay, [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, it's a good thing we have internet now.  Everything --
R:  Oh, I love it.
L:  Good.
R:  I mean, I've -- I'm in my fifties and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, I tell you, I just -- I --
