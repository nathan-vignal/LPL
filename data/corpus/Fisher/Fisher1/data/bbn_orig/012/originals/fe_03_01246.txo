L:  Hi, I'm Kimberley[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Nancy[?].
L:  Oh, good, at least I got a female. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm not sure that really matters, but anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But females sometimes have a little bit more understanding, ah, and as far as the answer to their question, I don't think it's a good idea at all actually, because it gives a false sense of security to people.  But ah, anyhow that's my perspective on it and what's your perspective my dear [LAUGH]?
R:  Um.  Well --
L:  [NOISE] You understand what affirmative action is and everything?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Well, I just didn't know -- I don't know how old you are, so I -- it's hard to know that. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I think it can be a good thing, but not if it's, um --
L:  Well, the -- I think the idea that they started out with -- what they were trying to do was probably a good thing, but the problem is -- is that like most things, it usually gets taken way out of context of what it was initially supposed to be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and now it's basically not, ah, helpful to anybody.  All it is is a -- creates a problem and, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sorry, I was looking for something while I was talking.  Ah, but ah I don't know -- I don't -- I just don't think that -- it gives people a false sense of security of who they are and it gets them hired for their -- color of their skin or whatever, but then when it comes down to doing the work, businesses suffer and so do a lot of other people because they've got somebody in there who's not qualified to do the job.  And that's not a good thing.  So, I don't --
R:  Right.  I agree with that.
L:  Yeah, as someone who is a business owner, I just don't agree with hiring someone [NOISE] just because they have a certain color of skin.  I don't agree with not hiring somebody because of the color of their skin either, but at the same time --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they're not qua- -- if somebody who's white is more qualified at the job than someone who's black, then I want the person who's more qualified for the job [inaudible], regardless of the color of their skin.  If they're black or they're Asian or whatever, I don't care, you know? [LAUGH] But ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anyhow, um -- um -- but that's basically my perspective on it.  I think that they can very easily, ah, get caught in the cycle to where they just get caught in the cycle where they just get a job.  It's kind of like our government jobs these days which is a really bad situation because they've got people in there who know they can't get fired and so they just don't really work. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I think it's kind of outlived its purpose.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  You know?
L:  -- it's -- and it's causing lots of problems these days, because as a business owner y- you get people in here ah -- well, even not as actually as a business owner as much as a, ah -- the county jobs and stuff.  It's like the social services is really a lousy job -- o- o- o- -- lousy community these days.  I don't know what you do or whatever and I'm -- certainly, I'm not trying to throw any cold water -- I don't know what you do, so I guess I better hold on and ask that question. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no I'm a student --
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, you sounded young but --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- I didn't know exactly how young.  What are you studying?
R:  Geography.
L:  Oh -- well, now that's an interesting ch- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, thing, but ah -- um -- and what are you planning to do with geography?
R:  Ah, hopefully something in meteorology.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's all good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.  That's a -- and we can always use people who are -- who pay attention to the -- the weather formations and everything out there so -- and who know what they're doing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because there are enough of them out there --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- who don't know what they're doing, but. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Since I call the weather bureau almost every day to find out what to expect that day, it's kind of nice when they actually get it right. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But ah unfortunately you also can't control what -- that things happen and stuff that changes overnight sometimes and -- but anyhow ah -- now the -- going back to the -- the topic at hand or whatever, ah -- it's like right now the social services department, um -- I -- I had been on welfare several years ago when I lost another business and, ah, basically got treated like I was a criminal or something and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and there were a lot of people in that s- structure who -- they weren't as interested in trying to help you get out of welfare as they were interested in having you follow their rules, which makes no sense whatsoever [LAUGH] to me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Because you know, they'd have it set up to where you -- virtually, you're stuck being on welfare because there's no way to get out unless you really are willing to take some chances.  And ah -- and -- and that's why I say that the, ah -- you know, having -- I can't think of the name of it now, the -- well, the topic of conversation.  I can't think of the name of it, um --
R:  Um.
L:  It's like it just slipped my mind, um ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But ah basically having it so that they -- if someone can get hired for the color of their skin its' really scary, because you get people into an office, especially in -- ah, where social services and other things like that and it -- so that they -- they -- they're basically guaranteed -- affirmative action, that was the name of it, but ah -- that they're guaranteed their job just because they have a certain color of skin.  The problem with that is that they can get in there and then they -- then nobody can get rid of them and get somebody who can actually do the job properly and -- ah, especially in governmental positions and stuff like that.  But it's a really scary place to be because they have people's lives in their hands and if they don't know what they're doing, then we're in real trouble. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  It's --
L:  But ah --
R:  -- really -- really bad when you're turned away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from something that you know so much about, just because you just happen to not fit the quota.
L:  Exactly and, ah, I kn- -- I mean, fortunately I've never personally been in that situation, just simply because I've generally gone out and gone into my own business because that's what I like to do.  But ah I think that a lot of people are more willing to just get a job that will be there and they just want something that's safe and dependable that they don't have to deal with any risk and, ah, unfortunately a lot of them aren't willing to actually do their job.  They just want a job that pays them and they want to do what they want to do in the process.  And that's one of the reasons this country has got a lot of the problems it does is because people who've gotten where they wanted, depend on the government to take care of them, instead of them taking care of the government. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Which is a little scary, but ah anyhow --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  -- a -- and -- and -- I -- I don't mean to -- I -- I'm forty four, I'm just curious as to how old a student you are.  Are you in your tw- --
R:  I'm twenty three.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, you're in your --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- early twenties.  So, you're -- are you a senior at this point then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  So, you're -- you're getting close to -- to getting out and getting into the --to the real world [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, hopefully just one more semester.
L:  -- so to speak.  And a- are you in school -- ah, what area of the country do you go to school in?
R:  Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, now that's interesting.  Are you planning to stay in Illinois or are you going to move out to another area of the country?
R:  Well, my husband and I would like to go to Texas, just because we --
L:  Oh!  Well, that's where I'm from. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I'm from Dallas --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- originally.  So, ah -- and lived down South of Austin for a long time, ah -- you'll find some interesting weather there. [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- in all different sections of the c- -- of the state, because they have various different weather patterns in the different areas.  Ah, my family lives -- or my parents live in Dallas and I have sister who lives in Amarillo and, ah, I've lived down close to the Austin area and in -- in Curville and several other areas.  And I lived in Lubbock for three months which was -- as far as I was concerned a -- a-- a -- the pit of hell. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Because it's all desert and there is nothing there to do  --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  but uh -- I was also eighteen years old and had no car that summer so it was --
R:  Oh, yeah!
L:  -- really bad -- really bad place to be but ah, you know, I -- I -- they're -- evidently -- I mean, my sister and her husband are out there in Amarillo which is pretty much just the same thing, but I wouldn't want to live down there.  Ah, what area of Texas would you -- ah, thinking of going to?
R:  Um, Dallas, actually.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well then you'll be okay, because it -- that has seasons and it still has, ah, a lot of, ah -- ah -- um, what am I trying to say, um [SIGH] -- ah, they have the warm and stuff.  Now, be prepared for the humidity, I don't know how -- how humid it is in Illinois but ah, you're going to have a lot of humidity in Dallas. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah I'm from Southern Illinois and it gets really humid here.
L:  Okay, well --
R:  So.
L: -- and it -- because one of the reasons I'm glad I moved from Te- -- I'm -- I live in California now and, ah, would never in a million years go back [LAUGH] to Texas.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't want to go back and be -- and my mother -- in fact, my mom and I had a conversation a couple of days ago, and she says, "Well, are you sure you don't move back to Texas?" and I said --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Not in a million years, thank you" [LAUGH].  I said, "The only way I'm [inaudible] -- moving back there is if God tells me I have to". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No way, but ah [LAUGH] -- because I don't like the humidity and I mean, it's humid year round, so there's no -- y- -- you don't get away from it, it's like -- ah, you get off the airplane in the -- in the airport and it's an indoor -- I mean, I'm sure you've been to DFW or maybe haven't been to DFW, it's an indoor airport, so you get off the plane into the indoors and you can still feel the humidity the moment you step off the plane --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
L:  -- it's
