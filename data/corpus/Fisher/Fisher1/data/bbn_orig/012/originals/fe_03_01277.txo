L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Stacey.
R:  Hi, Stacey.  I'm Jacqueline.
L:  Nice to meet you.  Where -- what part of the country are you from?
R:  I live in Phoenix, Arizona, but right now I'm, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with my mom in Dallas, Texas.
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so it's kinda fun.
L:  I'm up in, um, just north of Chicago by the Wisconsin border.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  Yeah, and, um, one of the best trips I've ever, ever taken was, um, this whole big tour of all the big cities in Texas.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Yeah, so that was --
R:  It's a great -- it's a great place. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and it's so nice and warm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's so -- it gets so cold here.  Today we g- -- we finally have a nice day of, like, seventy one degrees.
R:  Oh, nice, yeah.
L:  But --
R:  That's about -- we're -- we're about the same here, so nice.
L:  Last week it was, you know, in the thirties. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Way too cold. [LAUGH]
L:  So, they said current events, I heard?
R:  Yeah, how do we -- how do we get our current events?
L:  I don't know.  I, um -- this is my first call.
R:  Mine too.
L:  Oh, wonderful. [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that fun. [LAUGH]
L:  We're -- we're not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We -- we have something in common then.
R:  We're not -- we're not so experienced. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um ...
R:  I would say I probably get the majority of mine from either TV or newspaper.  Um, I'm a -- I'm an avid paper reader, so that's my -- probably my main source, and then TV would be next [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, I probably -- um, I -- I run the TV most of the day when I'm, like, house cleaning and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and doing my chores around the house and do whatnot.  Um, so I -- especially when there's tragedy like now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I leave it on CNN all day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, all I listen to is CNN.  But I do read the newspapers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, when I'm not doing that I'm -- if I'm not listening to the TV I'm listening to the radio.  I guess I need company. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No, I -- I agree.  I -- I -- I have something, some type of noise going on that, you know, offsets the -- the three children rattling around. [LAUGH] But --
L:  And how old are your kids?
R:  Uh, they're four, three and two.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, they're -- they're kinda close. [LAUGH]
L:  I have an eleven year old.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  And, uh, well, I'm way past that stage.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And he put gray hair on me, too, so ...
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.  No, they're -- they're -- they're a dream, though.  I wouldn't -- I don't know what I'd do without 'em.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They're pretty cute, pretty cute, so ...
L:  Completely understand that.  Um --
R:  I bet he gives you a lot of current events, you know, from school and stuff?  That probably brings in quite a bit.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Um, did you watch the Oscars or -- or any part of it last night?
R:  I did, yeah.  I watched quite a bit of it, actually.
L:  Did you see that -- oh, I forgot his name.  The director or whatever for the -- he was nominated for the documentary, uh --
R:  Documentary on Columbine, the ...?
L:  Yeah, Bowling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Uh --
R:  Yeah, that was interesting. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  That was interesting.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness, it -- you know, I -- speaking of current events, yeah, I'm a veteran --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I was in, um, the first -- the ninety -- the last war, let's say. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, you know, we probably should have done more then so we didn't have to come back.
R:  Uh-huh.  I agree.
L:  But having been over there and seeing what people go through, um, [NOISE] I -- I -- I'm -- I stand fully behind, you know, our troops and the President.
R:  Right, right.  I -- I'm a -- I'm a -- I'm an avid supporter of the war, so I -- I can't say that I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I don't wish that we had gone into it, but, you know, I -- I think we're already there, it's -- it's a done deal, and, you know, I -- I think we have pretty strong intelligence to get us there.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and that's another --
R:  And if -- and if we're gonna get into it, we might as well support it, you know, especially our troops and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- now with everything going on, you- you've gotta be behind 'em, so ...
L:  America's children out there.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  Fighting for our freedom and the -- the protestors nowadays, [NOISE] you know, they --
R:  Yeah, I -- I --
L:  They don't -- I don't think they're realizing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the Government is not gonna give us all their national securities on why we're over there.
R:  Right, and especially this early.  I mean, I -- I could see protesting if it drags out to three or four years, you know, then -- then I can kind of see maybe protesting a little bit, but this -- you know, we're -- we're at such an early stage in the game.  I don't -- I don't think it's even -- even plausible that you could, you know, protest it now, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think it's a slap in the face to 'em and I think we need to -- I -- I think our country has a lot of liberties that we need to -- to respect but some of the protests need to -- they need to just chill out. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it -- you know, a lot of people died for the freedom that we're trying to give --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the Iraqis, you know,
R:  Mhm.
L:  And plus save our homeland from, you know --
R:  That's right.
L:  And --
R:  And I tell you, you hear some of those stories where, you know, the women are just shot or they -- you know, they lure the -- even Saddam, he's lured his own son in laws back to kill 'em.
L:  Well, I mean --
R:  What -- what kind of man does that? [LAUGH]
L:  You know what else is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- goes on and -- and, you know, it's not really widely publicized, but you know how women are, you know, have to walk back and -- in -- in behind the husband?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, they also -- the women over there are, um, circumcised.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I mean, so the man who actually probably has a higher sex drive than the female --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- or more -- more tend to wander eyes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't have to, you know, make sure that they're home and faithful.
R:  That's right.
L:  But the women, they mutilate 'em.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's --
L:  So they can keep 'em --
R:  Oprah actually a couple of months ago had a great show on that, and it was -- I'm, like -- I -- I wanna tape it and show it to everybody that I know. [LAUGH] I'm like, "Well, yeah" --
L:  Oh, okay, so --
R:  This is dreadful[?] to think that this is still going on in the -- for, you know -- it -- it's hard for us, I think, to even fathom the idea of, you know, doing something like that.  But, you know, to children, especially when they're only, like, nine or ten when it happens, and I'm like, "Gosh, that's just unbelievable".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Unbelievable.
L:  It -- it is, it's so unbelievable and, you know, and they're just so repressed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where, you know, they -- they can't work and they can't -- you know, the -- the little school kids can't -- you know, the girls, they can't go to school.  Well, now in Afghanistan they can because we went in and took out the Taliban.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And that was such a nice -- it -- it was a nice thing to see on the news, all those kids in school, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- finally when it started, and, you know, them taking their veils off.  I loved that part. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, most definitely, 'cause, you know, they're the, um [NOISE] -- you know, they're the -- the future of their own country.
R:  Right, right.
L:  They should be --
R:  Yeah, I -- I think we're doing -- I think we're doing a good thing right now, and hopefully it -- you know, hopefully it's -- hopefully it's speedious[?] and, you know, we don't lose too many people, and I hope they don't lose too many people.  I mean, I think -- you know, I think we're going after [inaudible].
L:  They'll probably lose more than we do, but we -- I think we're gonna lose more this time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than we did in ninety one.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I definitely think so.  I think we'll lose quite a few, and I think we'll see some pretty high terrorist attacks on our own country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In retaliation for it, and I think we'll lose a lot on our own soil which is gonna really devastate a lot of people.  Um, but, you know --
L:  And the protestors will be out more. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  They'll be out in full force, but then, you know, they wouldn't have that freedom to do that if they didn't live in this country, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] It makes me wanna go, "Can't you guys think past your -- you know, the nose on your face?" [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, you know.
R:  Yeah.  It's interesting, so ...  I have no idea how long we've talked. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well, we -- we talk for ten minutes and [MN] the lady -- I talked to a lady on the phone 'cause she called me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause at -- at first they wanted my social security number on the website --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when -- you know, I -- I just saw this flashing banner and so I clicked it and I thought, "Oh, well, how bad could that be?" you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I got down and it wanted my social security number.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I said, "What kind of scam is that?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So then, anyway, she called me.  I guess they -- the computer saved part of my information, and she had called me and said, "We no longer" -- they no longer need our social security numbers to participate.  They found another way to process, uh, research checks.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Um, and then she told me that the computer would come on, like the one that connected us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would come on at ten minutes and let us know when we could say goodbye.
R:  Did she?  Oh -- oh, that's nice.  So, you don't have to sit there and clock yourself?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Well, good.  I like that.
L:  'Cause I was worried about that.
R:  Yeah.  I didn't like giving my social security number, but I participate in the Arizona State University children development program, too, so I called them and I'm like, "Is this really legit?" [LAUGH] And so she researched it for me and she said, "Yeah, yeah, it's -- it's a good thing".  So, she said, "I wouldn't" -- she said, you know, "You gave it -- you gave it to us".  I'm like, "Well, yeah, but you guys came to the hospital when I had the baby". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "I've had personal contact with you". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Yeah, you know, that's a little different. [LAUGH]
L:  So, do you have boys or girls or both or ...?
R:  I have one girl.  Um, the oldest is a girl.  She's four.  And then I have two boys, and actually she's turning five in, uh, the end of this week.
L:  I hear boys -- I only have one, and he's a boy.  I hear boys are so much easier to raise.
R:  Well, you know, I find right now, you know, I'm a -- I'm a girly girl and my daughter's a girly girl, and, um, I -- I have so much fun --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with her, you know, playing dress up and all that.  I can't really connect with the boys yet, but I've heard, you know, once they get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- past five and really start school that they're a lot easier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the girls tend to become -- 'cause she's so independent now, but I think she -- they said she come- becomes more dependent on, you know, my advice and what I'm doing and [LAUGH] I'm, "Okay".
L:  Well, I have --
R:  And the boys just kinda do their own thing.  I'm like, "Okay".  So, but my husband likes -- he --
