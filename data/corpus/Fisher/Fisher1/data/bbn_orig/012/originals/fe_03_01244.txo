R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi --
R:  Hi, my name is --
L:  Hi, I'm Maggie[?].
R:  I'm Jerry[?].
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.
L:  So, what do you think about affirmative action?
R:  Ah, I'd say in some cases it's good, in some cases it's not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Depends on the per- --
L:  Is the topic in -- in business or in school?
R:  I would say in business.
L:  In business? Ok- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gosh, I don't know.  I think I'm -- I'm pro affirmative action in school setting as -- as far as admissions are concerned, but I think -- I think in business, I don't know.  Hm, what do you think?
R:  I think, ah, in business would be a -- an entirely different situation than a school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as far as affirmative action is concerned.
L:  Mhm.  Have you had any experience with affirmative action?
R:  Ah, somewhat in the past twenty five years of working, yes I have.
L:  Mhm.  What's your occupation?
R:  I'm a fire inspector for a private company.  The only female in the field.
L:  Okay.  So, what do you do for that?
R:  I inspect fire alarm systems for the N.F.P.A. and for the State of Wisconsin.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  And you?
L:  I'm a student.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  A student in Boston.
R:  Okay.  What are you majoring in?
L:  I'm majoring in sociology.
R:  Okay. [NOISE] And what experience do you have in affirmative action?
L:  Um, not too much besides what I read, um, from newspapers and, ah -- I know the -- the law school out in Michigan there's a big court case going on there, as far as discrimination -- and, ah, it's actually really interesting for me, I like to study that.  You know, I'm a sociology major so it's -- all goes together and I'm actually thinking about law school as well, so.  So, I think it's an interesting topic.  I don't know, I think it helps to le- level the playing field often, but I'm not so sure how I feel about it -- um, about affirmative action in business though.
R:  Okay.  Well, I know from first hand experience, being a female and being the only female in a field of technicians of about sixty guys --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- ah, it's very difficult to survive in what they call today a man's world.
L:  Sure.
R:  So -- and I have no -- no degree in electronics and it's all based on -- on on hand experience.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's how I got the position with the company.  And it --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and it's been very tough and I don't get paid what the guys get paid, so.
L:  Yeah, I've read that women make seventy six cents for every dollar that a man makes and that's just -- that's very troubling.
R:  It is very troubling, because I work just as hard as they do, if not harder.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I won't kiss anybody's ass to get anywhere in life either. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.  What kinds of difficulties have you -- have you found in -- in your job?
R:  Well, I have, ah, been kicked out of police stations for being a woman.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, because they don't feel that I'm qualified.  They feel that women belong at home, bare foot and pregnant.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I've had to, ah, gain a respect and, ah -- and able to go back and to do their inspections.  It's very difficult in my field.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've gained a lot of respect over the years, but I still meet new customers that don't think women belong in the field, they would- -- believe women belong at home.
L:  Sure.  Yeah, there's a lot of people out there like that.
R:  Sure.  And, ah, unfortunately that's not the society that we live in today.  You need two incomes.  I'm not going to sit behind a desk and answer phones, it's not me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I'd rather be a on hands type of individual versus being ah -- I don't -- I don't take orders well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, sitting and have somebody look over my shoulder all day long.  I like to work independently and I do that in my job and I do that very well.  And I'm confident.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've been in the business for almost twenty years.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yup.  So, is this all that survey, ah, talks about, is just this?
L:  Um, I -- [several inaudible words] today's topic, yeah, the --
R:  Today's topic.
L:  -- affirmative action.  I think there's different topics every day.  Actually, this is the first one that I've participated in.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...
R:  Me too.
L:  So, what do you think about the war in Iraq?
R:  I think it's pretty scary.  I've got two older brothers that are -- they're forty nine and fifty years old, one on the USS [inaudible] and one on the ground in the National Guards.
L:  Oh, wow.  Are they serving over there right now?
R:  Yes, they are.  Yup, my brother's in the, ah, Persian Gulf and the other one is over in, ah, Kuwait.
L:  Awesome.
R:  So, yeah, it's -- it's really scary, but ah, long term I think, ah, that we will be a lot better off with, ah, Saddam Hussein out of office.
L:  I agree.
R:  It's unfortunate that we have to, ah, go to these lengths to make it happen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I -- I'm a person that does not believe an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth, but if you have to stop somebody and this is the only way you can do it, then we need to do that and I hope that nobody gets killed and that people don't lose their brothers or sisters or parents of what have you.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's not -- ah, it's a very dif- -- very touchy to- -- very touchy subject for everybody.
L:  Yeah, that's for sure.
R:  There's a lot of, ah, protesting going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't want our people over there.  Well, I'll tell you what, if you don't want any people over there and we get bombed, what are we going to do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you let your guard down, what's going to happen?
L:  I know, I totally agree.  It has to be done, I think the regime has to be changed and I've been watching the news and everything and it's -- it's just so crazy, especially for somebody of my generation.  I -- I'm nineteen years old and, you know, my generation has never, you know, had anything like this.  You know, we didn't experience Vietnam and we were too young for, you know, the first Gulf war and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just -- it's really scary to talk about it in classes and everything and -- and especially the deep divide that it seems like it's causing in the generation.  I mean, there's so many students protesting and then there's, you know, some like me who support, you know, our government.  It's hard because --
R:  Well, you -- you put -- you put a man in office who has to take care of our country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We may not always agree with his decisions -- his or her decisions, but he's the one that's protecting us, he really is.  I'm going --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be thirty eight years old here.  You know, I've got a son who's just two years younger than you are and he's talking about joining the Service.  You know, as a -- as a parent with one child, I -- I can't imagine my son going into the Service, but on the other hand if that's what my son wants to do to protect his -- his country, I commend him for that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if it's going to bring -- bring people down like that and take them out of control --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and keep us safe, by all means, I gladly give my son my support, in doing so.  It's just a shame that our country and the people that are living in this country can't be that supportive.  When our gentlemen and women came back from Vietnam, do you know how badly [inaudible] they were?  I know --
L:  I -- I've heard -- I've heard that they were.
R:  It was -- it was awful.  I mean, I was very young myself, but my older brothers served in that war.  To this day, they still don't talk about it because it was so traumatic.  And what did the people in this country do?  Did they welcome them home?  No, they didn't.  They didn't do that.  Today -- now, we give them everything that they need --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but back then we didn't.  Do we want to make the same mistake today?  No, I don't think that we sh- -- that we should make the same mistake.  Put our trust in our government, let them do what they need to to protect us, otherwise the World Trade Center not only once is it going to happen, but it's going to happen again and again and again and again, until somebody stops it.
L:  Yup --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- and every single day [several inaudible words] when watch the news, it just seems like -- like more and more, this is the right thing to do and not only for our country but [inaudible] -- for the Iraqis as well.  I mean, I've seen them come out and -- and dance in the streets and tear down posters of Saddam and it just seems like it's really -- it's really the right thing to do and I wish that all the peace protesters would realise that and start respecting our troops and our government.
R:  Right and they don't.  And -- and it's very unfortunate, because it turns into a lot of hatred in this country and that's the last thing that this country needs right now is to turn against each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We should all be working together and sticking together like we have all these years.  It's terrible.  It's really sad, I wouldn't want to be a young woman like yourself today, making plans for marriage and having a family.  I -- I wouldn't have any more children.  I wouldn't want them to live in this kind of society with that kind of hatred.  There's no way, forget it.  It's bad enough my son has to live it now.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's definitely a changing society.  I mean, our -- this -- the events that have been unfolding in the past, you know, two or three days, I mean , they're going to define my generation.  I mean, you know, what -- what happens with foreign policy and what the Arab world thinks of us and it's just very scary.  I feel like I don't really have that much control over it right now, but I know in the future that's going to be what -- what we're going to have to deal with, anti American sentiment everywhere.
R:  Yes, it is going to be your responsibility and your generation's responsibility.  It will come to that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I wish you kids all the best of luck in the world. [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you.
R:  [LAUGH] And make us proud will you?  We live in a good country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We do, we have, ah --
L:  Yeah, we do.
R:  -- we've got life made her.  We re- -- we really do.
L:  We, really do.  We live in the best country in the world and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I wish more people in my generation
